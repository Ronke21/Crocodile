<text>&quot;The Five Doctors&quot; is a special feature-length episode of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, produced in celebration of the programme&#x27;s 20th anniversary. It had its world premiere in the United States, on the Chicago PBS station WTTW and various other PBS member stations on 23 November 1983, the anniversary date. It was transmitted on BBC1 in the United Kingdom two days later.

&quot;The Five Doctors&quot; was written by Terrance Dicks, who had been the script editor for the entirety of the Third Doctor&#x27;s era and had written for the series since the 1960s. The episode aired after the conclusion of the 20th season to celebrate the 20th anniversary. Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee reprised their roles as the Second and Third Doctors, respectively. Richard Hurndall portrayed the First Doctor, as the character&#x27;s original actor, William Hartnell, had died since his last appearance on the show ten years previously. Since Tom Baker decided not to appear in the special, footage from the unfinished serial &quot;Shada&quot; was used to portray the Fourth Doctor.

==Plot==
An unknown entity uses the Time Scoop to bring several of the previous incarnations of the Doctor; his former companions Susan Foreman, Sarah Jane Smith, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart; and his enemies the Daleks, the Cybermen, a Raston Warrior Robot and a Yeti, from their respective time streams into the Death Zone on Gallifrey. The entity&#x27;s attempt to grab the Fourth Doctor and Romana ends up trapping the two in the time vortex. The Fifth Doctor senses the disruption of his own timeline, and with his own companions Tegan and Turlough, travels to Gallifrey via his TARDIS, also ending up in the Death Zone, unable to travel farther with the TARDIS due to a force field projected by the Tomb of Rassilon, the tower at the centre of the Death Zone. The various Doctors lead their companions towards the Tower while avoiding the hostile forces.

In the Citadel on Gallifrey, the High Council of Time Lords have also detected the disturbance in the Doctor&#x27;s timeline and the power drain from the Time Scoop, and Lord President Borusa has the Master summoned, to help rescue the Doctor, offering him a new set of regenerations and a pardon if he succeeds. The Master accepts, and is given a recall device by the Castellan and a copy of the High Council&#x27;s seal before he is transmatted to the Zone. The Master encounters the Third Doctor, who dismisses him and accuses him of making the seal himself, before finding the Fifth just as they are surrounded by Cybermen. The Master is knocked out by a Cyberman&#x27;s gun firing, and the Doctor finds and uses the recall device to return to the Citadel. When the Master awakes, he makes a pact with the Cybermen to lead them to the Tower.

As the other Doctors and companions converge on the Tower, the Fifth Doctor discovers the recall device given to the Master included a tracking signal to lead the Cybermen to him. The Castellan is found to possess the forbidden Black Scrolls of Rassilon, and dies while attempting to escape an invasive mind probe. When the Doctor returns to the High Council&#x27;s chamber to report, he finds Borusa missing, and soon discovers a secret room with Borusa at the controls of the Time Scoop. Borusa reveals he seeks to be the President Eternal of Gallifrey and needed the Doctors to disable the force field over the Tomb in order to gain immortality from Rassilon&#x27;s Ring and rule forever. Borusa uses his headgear, the Coronet of Rassilon, to compel the Doctor to do his bidding. Meanwhile, the Master meets the First Doctor and Tegan and rids himself of the Cybermen by letting them fall victim to the Death Zone&#x27;s traps, before killing the Cyberleader with one of his subordinates&#x27; guns.

As Borusa expected, the other three Doctors and their companions have made it to the tomb chamber, bypassing the Yeti and Raston Warrior Robot, as well as phantoms of the Doctor&#x27;s former companions Jamie McCrimmon, Zoe Heriot, Liz Shaw and Mike Yates. They ponder the meaning of writing in the tomb: &quot;to lose is to win and he who wins shall lose&quot;. The Master arrives in the Tomb, but the Doctors&#x27; companions tie him up, with the Brigadier knocking him out for good measure. The Doctors disable the force field to summon the TARDIS, but this action allows Borusa and the Fifth Doctor to arrive via transmat. Borusa uses the Coronet to prevent the Doctors&#x27; companions from interfering while he speaks to Rassilon. An image of Rassilon appears above the tomb and offers Borusa his ring as the key to immortality. Borusa dons the Ring, but then shortly disappears, becoming living stone that is part of Rassilon&#x27;s tomb. The First Doctor realised what fate the tomb&#x27;s writing foretold: immortality, but at a cost of perpetual incarceration.

Rassilon frees the Fourth Doctor and Romana from the time vortex and returns the Master to his own time; the Doctors immediately refuse his offer for immortality. The First, Second and Third Doctors collect their respective companions and return to their time streams as well, leaving the Fifth Doctor with Tegan and Turlough. Chancellor Flavia arrives via transmat, with the Chancellery Guard, and, after learning of Borusa&#x27;s fate, declares that the Doctor is now Lord President, a position he cannot refuse. The Doctor tells Flavia to return to the Citadel, as he will follow shortly, then quickly departs with his companions, as he has no intention of returning to Gallifrey any time soon. Tegan asks if he&#x27;s planning to jet off across the galaxy in an old spaceship running from his people. With a grin, he replies that of course he is, as that&#x27;s how his adventure started in the first place.

==Production==
The working title for this story was &quot;The Six Doctors&quot;. It would have been written by former script editor Robert Holmes and would have featured the Cybermen and their kidnapping of the five incarnations of the Doctor; in their attempt to extract Time Lord DNA to turn themselves into &quot;Cyberlords&quot;, the twist being that the First Doctor and Susan would actually be android impostors (the former being the &quot;Sixth Doctor&quot; of the title) and the Second Doctor would have saved the day. However, Holmes dropped out at an early stage and another former script editor, Terrance Dicks, was brought in instead. Some elements of this plotline would be reused in Holmes&#x27; own &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; (1985) and in Chris Chibnall&#x27;s &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; (2020).

The programme is officially a co-production with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, although the production team were not aware of this during production and the agreement in effect amounted to little more than a pre-production purchase pact. Nathan-Turner&#x27;s first choice of director for the story was Waris Hussein, who had directed the first-ever &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, in 1963. However, Hussein was in America at the time and was unable to accept the offer. Nathan-Turner then asked another veteran director, Douglas Camfield, to direct but he also declined. Camfield was also very ill with heart disease and this may have affected his decision not to direct the production. He died of a heart attack early in 1984.

The original script featured an appearance by the Autons, last seen in &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; (1971). After being dropped into the Death Zone, Sarah would have been attacked by a group of them before being rescued by the Third Doctor. However, due to budgetary restrictions, the scene was dropped and replaced in the finished version. Just before she meets the Third Doctor, Sarah falls a few feet down what fans have generally considered a rather unconvincing slope. In the novelisation, Sarah actually steps off a cliff. This was what was originally intended in the script, but for budgetary reasons the sequence was changed.

Location filming took place at Cwm Bychan, Llanbedr. The Yeti costume used in the serial was last used in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; in 1968. It had decayed badly in 15 years of storage, requiring dim lighting and selective camera angles during filming.

The story was prepared in two formats: the ninety-minute version and a four-part version, the latter designed for international distribution or repeat broadcasting in the ordinary series run. The episode breaks were, respectively, Sarah falling down the slope, the Cybermen placing their bomb outside the TARDIS while Susan and Turlough watch, and the Master appearing behind the First Doctor and Tegan while in the Dark Tower. This is the only programme from the classic series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for which all recorded and filmed material, including alternative and unused takes, fluffed scenes and so forth, still exists in broadcast-quality format. This allowed for the creation of a Special Edition of the story in 1995. &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; was recorded in four-channel stereo, but broadcast in mono. The later DVD releases had a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.

In the various publicity photos of the five Doctors from this story, a waxwork model of Tom Baker from a 1980 Doctor Who Exhibition in Madame Tussauds was used. According to producer John Nathan-Turner, Baker had agreed to do the photocall for the 20th anniversary but, suspecting that he might not turn up, Nathan-Turner arranged for the waxwork to be on location.

The end credits featured a specially-mixed version of the theme music, which began with Delia Derbyshire&#x27;s original 1960s arrangement and then segued into the Peter Howell arrangement being used by the series at the time (the former being played at a slightly higher speed to match the tempo and pitch of the latter). This arrangement was only used on this one occasion and was the last time that the Derbyshire version was heard during the show&#x27;s original run. A unique arrangement of the opening credits music was also used, which ended in a brief coda phrase that was never used in any other serial.

===Cast notes===
The First Doctor was played by Richard Hurndall, replacing William Hartnell, who died in 1975. Hartnell does make an appearance, however, in a pre-titles clip taken from the end of &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; (1964). After initially agreeing to take part, Tom Baker declined to return so soon after his departure from the series two years before, saying in 2014, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to play 20 per cent of the part. I didn&#x27;t fancy being a feed for other Doctors—in fact, it filled me with horror.&quot; His appearance was pieced together with footage from the unaired serial &quot;Shada&quot;.

In early drafts of the script, some of the Doctor and companion combinations were different. Originally, the Fourth Doctor would have been paired with Sarah Jane Smith, the Third Doctor with Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and the Second Doctor with Jamie McCrimmon. When Frazer Hines, Jamie&#x27;s actor, proved unavailable for more than a cameo appearance the script had to be altered, pairing the Second Doctor with Victoria Waterfield. This was revised again when Deborah Watling, Victoria&#x27;s actress, became unavailable and Baker decided not to appear, resulting in the pairings of the First Doctor with Susan, the Second with the Brigadier, the Third with Sarah Jane Smith, and the Fifth with Tegan and Turlough. Instead of meeting phantoms of Jamie and Zoe (Wendy Padbury), the Second Doctor and the Brigadier were originally scripted to meet Zoe and Victoria. The Doctor would have realised the truth about them when Victoria called Lethbridge-Stewart &quot;Brigadier&quot;, when she only knew him as a Colonel (in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;). Deborah Watling was unable to make the recording dates but Frazer Hines was able to free himself up for a day&#x27;s shooting, so Jamie was written in instead.

John Levene was invited back as Sergeant Benton but objected to the script requiring Benton to not recognise the Second Doctor. Levene felt this was unfaithful to his character, who he felt would not forget the Second Doctor, and he declined to participate. The scene was filmed with actor Ray Float portraying an unnamed UNIT Sergeant.

In April 2013, Carole Ann Ford revealed the producer had initially insisted that Susan not refer to the Doctor as her grandfather: &quot;You will not believe why. They said, &#x27;We don&#x27;t really want people to perceive him as having had sex with someone, to father a child.&#x27; I just screamed with hysterical laughter and said, &#x27;In that case, I&#x27;m not doing it.&#x27;&quot; The script was changed to include mentions of the characters&#x27; relationship.

==Broadcast and reception==

&quot;The Five Doctors&quot; was first broadcast in the United States on the actual date of the programme&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The broadcast in the United Kingdom was delayed two days so it could coincide with the BBC&#x27;s Children in Need charity night, with an outro in character by Peter Davison. There were a few segments in the BBC broadcast that had not been shown in the US airing.

A four-part-serial version of the story was shown on BBC1, nightly between 14 August and 17 August 1984 at 6:15 p.m., achieving viewing figures of 4.7, 4.5, 3.7 and 4.8 million, respectively.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping wrote of the special in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), &quot;A fine anniversary tale, although don&#x27;t analyse the plot too closely as it&#x27;s largely a collection of set pieces without a great deal of substance. This is Terrance Dicks&#x27; loving tribute to a series that he helped to mould and, as such, contains everything that it should.&quot; In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; &quot;is not as bad as it could have been ... [but] the story fairly groans at the seams with the inclusion of so many &#x27;old favourites&#x27;.&quot; Still, they felt that it worked as a one-off fun celebration.

In 2012, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; found the serial fun and made with a lot of love, though he noted the Third Doctor and Sarah Jane fared less well than some of the others. He also called it &quot;Anthony Ainley&#x27;s most effective outing&quot; and praised the efficient scripting and other aspects of production aside from Moffatt&#x27;s &quot;sedate&quot; direction. DVD Talk&#x27;s Stuart Galbraith gave the story four out of five stars, finding Hurndall&#x27;s performance as the First Doctor &quot;the show&#x27;s biggest, most delightful surprise&quot;. Writing for io9, Alasdair Wilkins said that the special was &quot;far from perfect&quot; and &quot;a big, silly adventure&quot;, but worked &quot;much better if you can selectively switch your brain off&quot;. Digital Spy&#x27;s Morgan Jeffery gave the story three out of five stars, writing that it was &quot;not the show&#x27;s finest hour&quot; but adding that it was &quot;fun if enjoyed in the right frame of mind.&quot;

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in November 1983; it was the only Target novelisation to be published before its story was aired. The novelisation features numerous deleted scenes that subsequently turned up on the special-edition DVD release of this story.

===Home media===
&quot;The Five Doctors&quot; was first released on VHS and Betamax in September 1985, using a unique to home video edit trimmed by 97s to allow the release to use a 90m cassette. This is distinct from shorter version sold to the USA, with different cuts. In 1990, the story was re-released, on VHS only, using the original UK broadcast edit. This version was also released on US LaserDisc in 1994.

A &quot;Special Edition&quot; of the episode (originally called the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;), with updated special effects, surround-sound compatibility and an alternate editing of the raw material was released on VHS in 1995 in a box set with the video of &quot;The King&#x27;s Demons&quot; and a limited-edition postcard album. This version also features a special BBC video ident, showing said ident being whisked away by the Time Scoop. The &quot;Special Edition&quot; was the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story to be released on DVD, on 1 November 1999. The Region 1 version has a commentary track by Peter Davison and writer Terrance Dicks. This would later be carried over to the 2008 re-release in Region 2.

On 22 August 2005 it was announced that &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; would be the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story to be made available to download to mobile phones, in a deal between BBC Worldwide and the technology firm Rok Player. The story was re-released as a &quot;25th anniversary edition&quot; DVD on 3 March 2008. This release contains both the original broadcast version and the special edition. The special was a free gift in issue 4 of Doctor Who DVD Files.

On 28 August 2015, &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; was released in Germany—with the German title &quot;Die Fünf Doktoren&quot;.

In September 2023, the story was released again in an upgraded format for Blu-ray, being included with the other stories from Season 20 in the &quot;Doctor Who - The Collection Box Set&quot;. This release featured the original 1983 version, updated with new special effects. The only change retained from the 1995 version was Rassilon&#x27;s voice.

====Special Edition differences====
There are many differences between the original 1983 version of the episode and the 1995 special-edition version. Many of these changes were not carried over to the 2023 version.

* Several scenes have been extended with previously unused footage. Some scenes also have new musical cues.
* Some scenes are re-ordered to match the original script.
* At the beginning there are added scenes of the Dark Tower&#x27;s exterior and interior.
* The Time Scoops&#x27; black triangles have been replaced with a new effect, resembling an upside-down whirlwind.
* The Time Scoop sent to capture the Fourth Doctor turns black before capturing him, visibly indicating a malfunction.
* Thunder sound effects have been added to the scenes of the First Doctor trapped in the mirror-maze as well as to the scene of him outside the front gate.
* There is a visual-effect added onto the Dalek in the mirror-maze after it is struck by its own weapon to suggest intensifying heat prior to it exploding.
* The Dark Tower slowly becomes visible through the destroyed wall panel after the Dalek explodes.
* All beam effects, including the boobytrapped checkerboard floor, have been redone.
* The effect of the Fifth Doctor and the phantoms fading away have been altered to look less similar.
* The image and visual effect of the Fourth Doctor stuck in the time-vortex has been changed: it no longer includes Romana.
* Rassilon&#x27;s voice has been altered to sound more dramatic.
* The last scene of the Fourth Doctor returned to his proper place in space and time has been changed to a different clip from &quot;Shada&quot;.
* The scene at the end in which the various Doctors depart in their TARDISes has been replaced with &quot;Time Scoops&quot; departing instead.
* Whilst the Fifth Doctor and the Master are talking (having just met), the Cyberman who catches sight of them no longer says &quot;Ah!&quot; to himself.
* The music, dialogue and sound effects are re-mixed in stereo, with two exceptions: The pre-credits clip of William Hartnell, and the Delia Derbyshire arrangement of the theme tune during the first half of the credits. These were left in mono for stylistic reasons.

===Soundtrack===
The complete original and special edition scores, as well as a selection of effects by Dick Mills was released on 14 September 2018. It was also released on 2-LP 28 September 2018, omitting the effects.

<text>Fort Towson was a frontier outpost for Frontier Army Quartermasters along the Permanent Indian Frontier located about two miles (3 km) northeast of the present community of Fort Towson, Oklahoma. Located on Gates Creek near the confluence of the Kiamichi River and the Red River in present-day Choctaw County, Oklahoma, it was named for General Nathaniel Towson.

==Early history==
Fort Towson was established in May 1824, under Col. Matthew Arbuckle, on the southern edge of Indian Territory to guard the border with Spanish colonial territory to the south. It was named for Nathaniel Towson, Paymaster General of the Army. It was originally called &quot;Cantonment Towson.&quot; A military trace was constructed in the 1820s as a wagon trail to connect the fort to other military forts in Arkansas. The fort was abandoned in April 1829, and the garrison moved to Fort Jessup. The cantonment was intended only as a temporary facility, having nothing but tents and a few wooden shacks.

In November 1830, the Army ordered the construction of a permanent fort in the area, as it had been assigned for the relocation of the Choctaw from present-day what became Mississippi, under the Indian Removal Act. A new site was chosen about from the original site. The new fort was reestablished as &quot;Camp Phoenix&quot; to protect the Choctaw Nation. It was renamed as Fort Towson in 1831. Gradually a settlement developed around it.

==Fort description==
The new Fort Towson was much more substantial. The north side was atop the bluffs of Gates Creek. The fort occupied a rectangle containing about half an acre. The officers&#x27; quarters consisted of three buildings on the north side of the rectangle. These structures were built of logs, 1.5 stories tall, with limestone foundations and covered porches facing south. Four other buildings were located on two sides of the rectangle, facing each other. These were one story high, but had higher foundations, effectively creating basements.

Those closest to the officers&#x27; quarters were a combination of sub-officers&#x27; quarters, quartermaster&#x27;s office, amusement parlor, and school room. The last two buildings were barracks for common soldiers. The kitchens and dining halls were in the basements. All the buildings were painted white. The square in front of the buildings served as a parade ground. A hospital building was on the east side, about from the last barracks building. Stables, shops and gardens were outside the rectangle on the east. The sutler&#x27;s building, the dairy and poultry yards were outside the rectangle on the west. The cemetery was about farther west.

==Conversion to Choctaw Agency==
After the construction of Fort Washita to the west in 1842, Fort Towson lost importance. It was garrisoned until June 1854. At that time, it was turned over to the use of the Choctaw Indian Agency, then run by Indian Agent Douglas H. Cooper. A storm in the same month blew the roofs off several buildings and did some other damage to the facility. A few years later, a fire destroyed all of the buildings except one of the barracks and the hospital. The remaining facilities are now managed by the Oklahoma Historical Society.

==Civil War and abandonment==
At the beginning of the American Civil War, the Confederacy took over the remaining buildings of the fort. They had created an alliance with the Choctaw, promising them and other tribes a state of their own if the Confederacy won their war. The fort was used as the headquarters of Confederate General Samuel B. Maxey. The last remaining Confederate Army troops were commanded by General Stand Watie (Cherokee), a principal chief of his nation until the end of the war. He surrendered to Union forces at Fort Towson on June 23, 1865.

The post was abandoned at the close of the Civil War. Soldiers buried in the cemetery were moved to Fort Gibson. The buildings fell into ruin and foundation stones were hauled off by local residents to be used for other buildings.

The location of the fort is designated as an Oklahoma Historic Site. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places (#70000531) in 1970.

<doc id="867557" wikidata="Q2603797" url="?curid=867557" title="Trichocentrum">
<text>Trichocentrum, often abbreviated Trctm in horticulture, is a genus in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Dancinglady orchid is a common name for plants in this genus. It was described by Stephan Ladislaus Endlicher and Eduard Friedrich Poeppig in 1836. This genus alone makes up the monogeneric Trichocentrum alliance, a quite distinct lineage of the subtribe Oncidiinae.

The 68 currently recognized species are epiphytes species, distributed in damp forests from Mexico and Florida to Argentina.

==Description==
The pseudobulbs are reduced. The obtuse, fleshy leaves are 9 cm long. They are broadly elliptic to ovate-lanceolate.

The large, showy flowers grow basally on a short peduncle in a single-flowered to few-flowered raceme. They are white, or white covered with maroon dots. The petals and sepals are similar.

The long lip carries a short spur. This feature distinguishes the genus from other Oncidiinae, in which the spur is an extension of the column. The short column has a pair of apical wings on the stigma. The anther often bears minute e. There are two waxy pollinia, connected to elongate stipes.

==In horticulture==
&quot;Trichocentrum&quot; species are highly appreciated by orchid growers; some consider them to be among the most beautiful orchids on earth. Culture of members of this genus is highly variable, ranging from the drought-tolerant and easy-to-grow Tiger-like Trichocentrum (&quot;T. tigrinum&quot;) to smaller and more delicate species.

In cultivation they are subject to rot unless provided with conditions similar to those they experience in the wild. Extensive research into the ecological profiles of individual species may be required to achieve success cultivating them. Many species from Central America apparently endure a prolonged drought for at least part of the year, and have developed succulent leaves to deal with these conditions. Plants may shrivel quite severely without long-lasting injury.

==Chemistry and use as entheogen==
The Central and South American species &quot;Trichocentrum cebolleta&quot; (known formerly as &quot;Oncidium cebolleta&quot;) has been found to contain a variety of phenanthrenoids. This species is of considerable ethnobotanical interest as one of only a handful of orchids reported to be used as an entheogens. &quot;T. cebolleta&quot; is used as a substitute for &quot;hikuli&quot; a.k.a. &quot;peyote&quot; (the hallucinogenic cactus &quot;Lophophora williamsii&quot;) by the Tarahumara of Northern Mexico - a tribe noted for the large number of hallucinogenic plants which it uses in various shamanic and running-related practices. The combination of phenanthrenoid content and employment as entheogens in shamanic practices is to be found also in the Asiatic orchids &quot;Vanda tessellata&quot; and &quot;Dendrobium macraei&quot; (- known formerly as &quot;Ephemerantha macraei&quot; and &quot;Flickingeria macraei&quot; - see page &quot;Flickingeria&quot;). The orchidaceous genera &quot;Trichocentrum&quot;, &quot;Vanda&quot; and &quot;Dendrobium&quot; are all members of the subfamily &quot;Epidendroideae&quot; and are also placed currently in the subgroup/clade of Higher Epidendroids within the subfamily. Stermitz et al., however, do not report any evidence or suggest that the phenanthrenoids from &quot;Trichocentrum&quot; possess psychoactive properties. 

==Systematics==
There is disagreement as to the taxonomic status of some species that have recently been moved from &quot;Oncidium&quot; to &quot;Trichocentrum&quot;. Morphological characteristics of &quot;typical&quot; trichocentrums, such as being relatively small and squat with a short, few-to-several flowered inflorescence, contrasts sharply with the larger, heavier oncidiums with long, &quot;mule-ear&quot; leaves and showy, branched inflorescences with many flowers, or the &quot;rat-tail&quot; species with terete leaves.

While studies of molecular phylogeny has caused substantial reclassifications, it is uncertain whether this new scheme will be widely adopted. As with many plants, hybridisation might heavily confound cladistic analyses, though the exact extent is unknown. Hybridisation of &quot;Trichocentrum&quot; with &quot;Oncidium&quot; has resulted in the hybrid genus × &quot;Trichocidium&quot; for example, and similar events in the past would result in unrealistic assessments of relationship based on molecular phylogenetic studies with too limited a scope.

<text>Audrey Marie Munson (June 8, 1891 – February 20, 1996) was an American artist&#x27;s model and film actress, considered to be &quot;America&#x27;s first supermodel.&quot; In her time, she was variously known as &quot;Miss Manhattan&quot;, the &quot;Panama–Pacific Girl&quot;, the &quot;Exposition Girl&quot; and &quot;American Venus.&quot; She was the model or inspiration for more than twelve statues in New York City, and many others elsewhere. Munson appeared in four silent films, including unclothed in &quot;Inspiration&quot; (1915). She was one of the first American actresses to appear nude in a non-pornographic film.

== Career ==

=== Model ===

Audrey Marie Munson was born in Rochester, New York, on June 8, 1891, to Edgar Munson (1857–1945), who was a streetcar conductor and Western real estate speculator descended from English Puritans, and Katherine C. &quot;Kittie&quot; Mahoney (1863/1864–1958), a daughter of John and Cecilia Mahoney, Irish immigrants. Her father was from Mexico, New York, and she later lived there. Her parents divorced when she was eight, and Audrey and her mother moved to Providence, Rhode Island.

In 1909, mother and daughter moved to Washington Heights in New York City, where the 17-year-old Audrey sought a career as an actress and chorus girl. Her first role on Broadway was as a &quot;footman&quot; in &quot;The Boy and The Girl&quot; at the Aerial Gardens of the New Amsterdam Theatre, which ran from May 31 – June 19, 1909. She also appeared in &quot;The Girl and the Wizard&quot;, &quot;Girlies&quot; and &quot;La Belle Parée&quot;.

While window-shopping on Fifth Avenue with her mother she was spotted by photographer Felix Benedict Herzog, who asked her to pose for him at his studio in the Lincoln Arcade Building on Broadway and 65th Street. Herzog introduced her to his friends in the art world. She posed for muralist William de Leftwich Dodge, who gave her a letter of introduction to Isidore Konti. Konti was her first sculptor and her first nude modeling. From this point, Munson would pose for a few well-known visual artists, including painter Francis Coates Jones, illustrators Harrison Fisher, Archie Gunn, and Charles Dana Gibson, and photographers Herzog and Arnold Genthe, but she was predominately a sculptors&#x27; model.

Munson&#x27;s first acknowledged credit is Konti&#x27;s marble statuary called &quot;Three Graces,&quot; unveiled in the new Grand Ballroom at the Hotel Astor in Times Square in September 1909. She posed for all three Graces. Soon after that and for the next decade, Munson became the model of choice for the first tier of American sculptors, posing for a long list of freestanding statuary, monuments, and allegorical architectural sculpture on state capitols and other major public buildings. According to &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1913, &quot;Over a hundred artists agree that if the name of Miss Manhattan belongs to anyone in particular it is to this young woman.&quot;

By 1915, she was so well- established that she became Alexander Stirling Calder&#x27;s model of choice when he became Director of Sculpture for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition held in San Francisco that year. Her figure was &quot;ninety times repeated against the sky&quot; on one building alone, atop the colonnades of the Court of the Universe, roughly modeled on St. Peter&#x27;s Square in the Vatican. In fact, Munson posed for three-fifths of the sculpture created for the event and earned fame as the &quot;Panama–Pacific Girl&quot;.

=== Film actress ===

Munson&#x27;s newfound celebrity helped launch her career in the nascent film industry and she starred in four silent films. In the first, &quot;Inspiration&quot; (1915), made by the Thanhouser Film Corporation in New Rochelle, New York and directed by George Foster Platt, she appeared fully nude in a story of a sculptor&#x27;s model. The censors were reluctant to ban the film, fearing they would also have to ban Renaissance art. Munson&#x27;s films were a box office success, although the critics were divided. Thanhouser hired a lookalike named Jane Thomas to do Munson&#x27;s acting scenes, while Munson did the scenes where she posed nude. Although Munson&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Inspiration&quot; is sometimes said to be the first occasion of an American actress appearing nude in a non-pornographic film, according to film historian Karen Ward Mahr, Margaret Edwards did so first in &quot;Hypocrites&quot;, which was released earlier in 1915.

Munson&#x27;s second film, &quot;Purity&quot; (1916), made by the American Film Company in Santa Barbara, California and directed by Rae Berger, is the only one of her films to survive, being rediscovered in 1993 in a &quot;pornography&quot; collection in France and acquired by the French national cinema archive. Her third film, &quot;The Girl o&#x27; Dreams&quot;, also made by American in Santa Barbara and probably directed by Tom Ricketts from a story by William Pigott (the American Film Institute catalog lists Pigott as director, but all his other credits list him as a writer), was completed by the fall of 1916; although the film is mentioned on the credit lists of several of its actors in the October 21, 1916 &quot;Motion Picture Studio Directory,&quot; it was not released at that time and not copyrighted until December 31, 1918; there is no subsequent mention of the film and it may never have been released.

Munson returned to the East Coast by train via Syracuse in December 1916, having been involved with high society in New York and Newport, Rhode Island. There are accounts in which her mother insists she married the son of a &quot;Comstock Lode&quot; silver heir, Hermann Oelrichs Jr., then the richest bachelor in America. There is no record of this. On January 27, 1919, she wrote a rambling letter to the U.S. State Department denouncing Oelrichs as part of a pro-German network that had driven her out of the movie business. She said she planned to abandon the United States to restart her movie career in England.

=== Notoriety ===

In 1919, Audrey Munson was living with her mother in a boarding house at 164 West 65th Street, Manhattan, owned by Dr. Walter Wilkins. Wilkins fell in love with Munson, and on February 27, murdered his wife, Julia, so he could be available for marriage. Munson and her mother left New York, and the police sought them for questioning. After a nationwide hunt, they were located. They refused to return to New York, but were questioned by agents from the Burns Detective Agency in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The contents of the affidavits they supplied have never been revealed, but Audrey Munson strongly denied that she had any romantic relationship with Dr. Wilkins. Wilkins was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to the electric chair. He hanged himself in his prison cell before the sentence could be carried out.

The Wilkins killing may even have marked the end of Munson&#x27;s modeling career, although she continued to seek regular newspaper coverage. By 1920, Munson could not find work anywhere and was reported as living in Syracuse, New York, supported by her mother, who sold kitchen utensils door-to-door. In November 1920, she was said to be working as a ticket-taker in a dime museum.

From January to May 1921, a series of twenty serialized articles ran in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s Sunday Magazine&quot; in dozens of Sunday newspaper supplements, under Munson&#x27;s name, entitled &quot;By the &#x27;Queen of the Artists&#x27; Studios&#x27;. &quot;The twenty articles relate anecdotes from her career, with warnings about the fates of other models. In one of them, she asked the reader to imagine her future:

In February that year, agent-producer Allen Rock took out advertisements showing a $27,500 check he said he had paid Munson to star in a fourth film titled &quot;Heedless Moths&quot;, directed by Robert Z. Leonard from his own screenplay based on these writings. She later said the $27,500 check was just a &quot;publicity stunt,&quot; and she filed suit against Allen Rock. Those proceedings revealed that the twenty articles had been ghostwritten by journalist Henry Leyford Gates.

In the summer of 1921, Munson conducted a nationwide search, carried by the United Press, for the perfect man to marry. She ended the search in August claiming she didn&#x27;t want to get married anyway. On October 3, 1921 she was arrested at the Royal Theater (later the Towne Theater) in St. Louis on a morals charge related to her personal appearance with the film &quot;Innocence&quot; (the reissue title of &quot;Purity&quot;), in which she had a leading role. She and her manager, independent film producer Ben Judell, were both acquitted. Weeks later, she was still appearing in St. Louis, along with screenings of &quot;Innocence&quot;, enacting &quot;a series of new poses from famous paintings&quot;.

On May 27, 1922, Munson attempted suicide by swallowing a solution of bichloride of mercury.

=== Later life and death ===
On June 8, 1931, Munson&#x27;s mother petitioned a judge to commit her to a mental asylum. The Oswego County judge ordered Munson be admitted into a psychiatric facility for treatment on her 40th birthday. She remained in the St. Lawrence State Hospital for the Insane in Ogdensburg, New York, where she was treated for depression and schizophrenia for 65 years, until she died at the age of 104. During her stay at the institution, she often maintained her physical beauty with milk, yogurt and urine.

In the mid-1950s, Munson was still famous enough to serve as the subject of an anecdote in a memoir that P.G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton wrote of their years on Broadway, &quot;Bring on the Girls!&quot; (1953), though that memoir is considered more fiction than fact by Wodehouse&#x27;s biographer.

Munson had no visitors at the asylum for over 25 years after her mother died in 1958, until her half-niece, Darlene Bradley, rediscovered her in 1984, when Munson was 93. In the mid-1980s, Munson, in her mid-90s, was moved to a nursing home in Massena, New York, as the original hospital closed; however, she would often escape to a nearby bar, with employees in the nursing home having to find her. Consequently, she was moved back to the new mental institution. By the time she turned 100, she had no teeth and lost much of her hearing but was otherwise in good health. Shortly after her 100th birthday, Munson broke a hip. Munson died on February 20, 1996, at the age of 104. At the time only one local newspaper reported her death. She was buried at New Haven Cemetery in New Haven, New York, and she received a headstone on her grave on June 8, 2016, 20 years after her death and on what would have been her 125th birthday.
==Sculptures of Munson==

This table is organized by sculptor and date. She posed for most of the sculptors who created architectural and fountain sculptures for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, and for other sculptors who exhibited there.

Coverage of Munson&#x27;s career contained inaccuracies during her lifetime, and errors about the works for which she modeled have been perpetuated. Munson herself was inconsistent about her age and other matters. For example, a June 1915 article listed the 24-year-old Munson&#x27;s age as 18, and an August 1915 press release claimed that she started posing at age 14 which would have been four years prior to her first known modeling credit, for Konti&#x27;s &quot;Three Graces&quot; group at the Hotel Astor, unveiled to the public in September 1909 when she was 18.


==Filmography==
All four films in which Munson appeared were thought to have been lost, until a copy of &quot;Purity&quot; (1916) was recovered in France in 2009.

In 2010, film director Roberto Serrini made a documentary about Munson which was featured in several news outlets including the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

<doc id="867566" wikidata="Q5958197" url="?curid=867566" title="Hyperkeratinization">
<text>Hyperkeratinization (American English or hyperkeratinisation in British) is a disorder of the cells lining the inside of a hair follicle. It is the normal function of these cells to detach or slough off () from the skin lining at normal intervals. The dead cells are then forced out of the follicle (primarily by the growing hair). However, in hyperkeratinization, this process is interrupted and a number of these dead skin cells do not leave the follicle because of an excess of keratin, a natural protein found in the skin. This excess of keratin, which is influenced by genetics, results in an increased adherence/bonding of dead skin cells together. This cohesion of cells will block or &quot;cap&quot; the hair follicle (leading to keratosis pilaris) or clog the sebaceous/oil duct (leading to acne). Pathogens may also play a role in causing, perpetuating, or simply taking advantage of this phenomenon, such as virulent sub-strains of &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; and irregular migration of &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; from the outer surface of the skin into the follicle, where commensal strains of &quot;C. acnes&quot; exclusively habitate. It itches mildly at times, and strongly at others. Very often it cannot be felt at all.

<doc id="867573" wikidata="Q1044593" url="?curid=867573" title="Caroline in the City">
<text>Caroline in the City is an American television sitcom that ran on NBC from 1995 until 1999. It stars Lea Thompson as cartoonist Caroline Duffy, who lives in Manhattan. The rest of the cast includes Eric Lutes, Malcolm Gets, Amy Pietz, and Andy Lauer. The series premiered on September 21, 1995, in the &quot;Must See TV&quot; Thursday night block between &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;ER&quot; and ran for 97 episodes over four seasons before it was cancelled; the final episode was broadcast on April 26, 1999. The series&#x27; rights are currently held by CBS Media Ventures.

==Summary==
Caroline Duffy (Lea Thompson), a cartoonist who lives in Manhattan, spends a lot of time with dates and lovers, and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors. In the pilot episode, she has broken up with Del Cassidy (Eric Lutes), who quickly finds another date. She hires Richard Karinsky (Malcolm Gets) to be her new colorist, and he pretends to be her new boyfriend during a dinner to prevent her from being embarrassed over Del&#x27;s moving on. During the first season, Richard develops feelings for Caroline.

Caroline&#x27;s success as a cartoonist is displayed throughout the first season; her cartoon character gets a balloon in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, she has a park dedicated to her in her native Peshtigo, Wisconsin, and she even has an offer for a cereal brand. When she was a child, she drew violent pictures of her brother Chris, and after dropping out of college, she started doodling at a copywriting job. It took less than five years for her cartoon to become nationally syndicated, and she even appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot;.

Towards the end of season one, Del proposes to Caroline. Richard is distressed by this, and searches for a new job. Although Richard has kept his feelings secret, their friends Annie Spadaro (Amy Pietz) and Remo (Tom La Grua) figure out that he loves Caroline. The day before the wedding, Richard writes her a love letter where he asks Caroline to meet him at Remo&#x27;s if she loves him. He leaves the letter in a pile of wedding thank-you cards. Caroline arrives at Remo&#x27;s but does not mention the letter, and continues with the wedding plans. Richard decides to leave Manhattan. When Caroline and Del call off the wedding, Caroline visits Richard&#x27;s apartment but he has left.

In the second season, Richard returns to Manhattan after having been in Paris where he had tried to sell paintings. Caroline gives the thank-you cards to a friend; Richard tries to find and destroy the love letter; he tosses it out of the window, only to have Annie find it. He resumes his old job as Caroline&#x27;s colorist. Later, Caroline discovers that she has feelings for Richard; however, Richard has reunited with his former girlfriend Julia, whom he met in Manhattan. Caroline leaves a message on his answering machine telling him that she loves him, but Julia discovers it and erases it.

Richard and Julia get married which prompts a bitter love triangle among the three. Richard eventually splits with Julia.

Caroline and Richard eventually become a couple. However, they split after arguing over whether to have children; Richard learned that Julia had a child. In the final episode, which ends on an unresolved cliffhanger, Annie and Del are now in a new relationship, while Caroline is about to marry another man—her childhood friend Randy—when Richard shows up at the wedding.

== Connections with other sitcoms ==

=== Connections with &quot;Frasier&quot; ===

Though not officially a companion show to &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Caroline in the City&quot; exists in the same universe (so likely also connects to both &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot; as well) with several crossovers and connections. Not only does the end of one early Season 1 episode feature &quot;Frasier&quot; characters, Daphne and Niles, in Frasier&#x27;s apartment (filmed on &quot;Frasier&quot;&#x27;s set and guest-starring Jane Leeves and David Hyde Pierce as their characters) looking at a &quot;Caroline in the City&quot; cartoon, but lead Eric Lutes played Frasier&#x27;s boss Tom Duran in two episodes. David Hyde Pierce also appears a second time as another character, this time playing an IRS man who dreams of being in &quot;Cats.&quot; Dan Butler (Bulldog in &quot;Frasier&quot;) had a recurring role as a museum owner, plus &quot;Frasier&quot; actors Harriet Sansom Harris (Bebe) and Edward Hibbert (Gil) appear in the same Season 3 episode as each other, playing different characters (and not sharing any scenes). Additionally, Scott Atkinson (who portrayed Daphne&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, Clive, in a &quot;Frasier&quot; episode) also appears playing Caroline&#x27;s love interest in one episode.

=== Connection with &quot;Friends&quot; ===

Matthew Perry appears as his &quot;Friends&quot; character Chandler Bing (not named but implied to be him and advertised by the network as such in their crossover promotions) in the episode &quot;Caroline and the Folks&quot; in a crossover appearance in which Annie meets Chandler at the video store. The same night, Lea Thompson appeared as Caroline Duffy (also never named as such but implied to be - and advertised as - her character) in the November 2, 1995, &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One with the Baby on the Bus&quot;.

=== Connection with &quot;The Single Guy&quot; ===

In the same episode - &quot;Caroline and the Folks&quot; - which featured Chandler from &quot;Friends&quot;, Jonathan Silverman also appeared, playing his character Jonathan Eliot (again not named but advertised as such) from the sitcom &quot;The Single Guy&quot;.

<text>A Klieg light is an intense carbon arc lamp especially used in filmmaking. It is named after inventor John Kliegl and his brother Anton Kliegl. Klieg lights usually have a Fresnel lens with a spherical reflector or an ellipsoidal reflector with a lens train containing two plano-convex lenses or a single step lens.

== Film ==
The carbon-arc source was so bright that it allowed film directors to shoot daytime scenes at night. The ultraviolet rays produced by the light also led to some actors developing an eye inflammation referred to as &quot;Klieg eye&quot;.

== Stage ==
In the early days of spotlights, the name &quot;Klieg light&quot; became synonymous with any ellipsoidal reflector spotlight (ERS), other carbon-arc sources or any bright source. Initially developed for film, the Klieg light was adapted for use as an incandescent stage fixture in 1911.

Although not completely certain, the title of the first ellipsoidal reflector spotlight often goes to the 1933 Klieglight, which was first used to light an outdoor pageant in New York. Century Lighting introduced their Lekolite, developed by Levy &amp; Kook, hence the name &quot;Leko&quot;, in the same year.

Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company was founded in 1896 and grew to be the largest stage lighting company in the world. The company closed in the 1990s, though members of the original Kliegl family continue to work professionally in the lighting industry to this day.
== Alternative name ==
While the Kliegls were German-born, the &quot;klieg light&quot; generic name for their type of stage and film lights was never popular in Germany, which developed Europe&#x27;s largest movie industry in the 1920s. &quot;Kliegl-Leuchte&quot; never caught on and was almost unknown, since the Kliegl Brothers company had limited business in continental Europe. Instead, the generic term was &quot;Jupiterlicht,&quot; or literally, Jupiter light, or in French &quot;lampes Jupiter,&quot; so named after a Berlin company supplying German and European studios and theater stages. The technical brand name quickly became popular as a generic metaphor for the movies. For example, renowned German-American cinema theorist and sociologist Siegfried Kracauer used the title &quot;Die Jupiterlampen brennen weiter&quot; for his 1926 critique of Sergey Eisenstein&#x27;s film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;; this classic text, often used in cinema studies, has been translated into English as &quot;The Klieg Lights Stay On&quot; but in French as &quot;Les lampes Jupiter restent allumées&quot;.

<text>Cattleya () is a genus of orchids from Costa Rica south to Argentina. The genus is abbreviated C in trade journals.

== Description ==
Epiphytic or terrestrial orchids with cylindrical rhizome from which the fleshy noodle-like roots grow. Pseudobulbs can be conical, spindle-shaped or cylindrical; with upright growth; one or two leaves growing from the top of them. The leaves can be oblong, lanceolate or elliptical, somewhat fleshy, with smooth margin. The inflorescence is a terminal raceme with few or several flowers. Flowers have sepals and petals free from each other; the lip or labellum (lowermost petal), usually has a different coloration and shape from the rest of the flower and covers in part the flower column forming a tube. There are four pollinia (bag-like organs that contain pollen). The fruit is a capsule with many small seeds.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was named in 1824 by John Lindley after horticulturalist William Cattley. Cattley obtained a specimen of then unnamed &quot;Cattleya labiata&quot; from William Swainson who had discovered the new plant in Pernambuco, Brazil, in 1817. The plant successfully bloomed under the care of Cattley and it became the type specimen from which Lindley described &quot;C. labiata&quot;.

Currently accepted species and subgeneric division within genus Cattleya are:
*Subgenus Cattleya
**Section Cattleya
**Section Crispae
***Series Cattleyodes
***Series Hadrolaelia
***Series Microlaelia
***Series Parviflorae
***Series Sophronitis
**Section Lawrenceanae
*Subgenus Cattleyella
*Subgenus Intermediae

== Nothogenera ==

Hybrids of &quot;Cattleya&quot; and other genera are placed in the following nothogenera:
* × &quot;Brassocattleya&quot; = &quot;Brassavola&quot; × &quot;Cattleya&quot;
* × &quot;Brassolaeliocattleya&quot; = &quot;Brassavola&quot; × &quot;Cattleya&quot; × &quot;Laelia&quot;
* × &quot;Cattleytonia&quot; = &quot;Cattleya&quot; × &quot;Broughtonia&quot;
* × &quot;Laeliocattleya&quot; = &quot;Cattleya&quot; × &quot;Laelia&quot;
* × &quot;Rhyncholaeliocattleya&quot; = &quot;Rhyncholaelia&quot; × &quot;Cattleya&quot;

== Cultivation ==

* &quot;Light&quot;
:Cattleyas need light, but not direct sunlight; in case of intense sunlight, shade must be provided.
* &quot;Temperature&quot;
:Day temperatures must be between 25–30 °C (77–86 °F) and night temperatures not lower than 10–12 °C (50–53.6 °F).
* &quot;Humidity&quot;
:Must be between 40–70% with good ventilation; however plants must not be exposed to air currents.
* &quot;Watering&quot;
:Water only if substrate is dry. It can be done once a week, but it all depends on the environmental conditions and the season.
* &quot;Fertilizing&quot;
:Cattleyas can survive without fertilizing. However, it is advisable to use nitrogen-based fertilizers without urea; fertilizers must be applied during the growth season. To avoid salt accumulation in the substrate, water thoroughly between fertilizer applications.

<text>Inter-range instrumentation group timecodes, commonly known as IRIG timecode, are standard formats for transferring timing information. Atomic frequency standards and GPS receivers designed for precision timing are often equipped with an IRIG output. The standards were created by the Tele Communications Working Group of the U.S. military&#x27;s Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG), the standards body of the Range Commanders Council. Work on these standards started in October 1956, and the original standards were accepted in 1960.

The original formats were described in IRIG Document 104-60, later revised and reissued in August 1970 as IRIG Document 104-70, upgraded later that year as the IRIG Document to the status of a Standard, IRIG Standard 200-70. The latest version of the Standard is IRIG Standard 200-16 from August 2016.

== Timecodes ==
The different timecodes defined in the Standard have alphabetic designations. A, B, D, E, G, and H are the standards currently defined by IRIG Standard 200-04.

The main difference between codes is their rate, which varies between one pulse per minute and 10,000 pulses per second.

The bits are modulated on a carrier. A three-digit suffix specifies the type and frequency of the carrier, and which optional information is included:

;Modulation type:
;Carrier frequency:
;Coded expressions
:Binary-coded decimal (BCD) day of year, hours, minutes, and (for some formats) seconds and fractions are always included. Optional components are:
:* Year number (00–99; century is not coded)
:* User-defined &quot;control functions (CF)&quot; occupying bits not defined by IRIG
:* &quot;Straight binary seconds (SBS)&quot;, a 17-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 86399.
:The types are:

The recognized signal identification numbers for each format according to the standard 200-04 consist of:
Thus the complete signal identification number consists of one letter and three digits. For example, the signal designated as B122 is deciphered as follows: Format B, Sine wave (amplitude modulated), 1 kHz carrier, and Coded expressions BCDTOY.

The most commonly used of the standards is IRIG B, then IRIG A, then probably IRIG G. Timecode formats directly derived from IRIG H are used by NIST radio stations WWV, WWVH and WWVB.

For example, one of the most common formats, IRIG B122:
:IRIG B122 transmits one hundred pulses per second on an amplitude modulated 1 kHz sine wave carrier, encoding information in BCD. This means that 100 bits of information are transmitted every second. The time frame for the IRIG B standard is 1 second, meaning that one data frame of time information is transmitted every second. This data frame contains information about the day of the year (1–366), hours, minutes, and seconds. Year numbers are not included, so the timecode repeats annually. Leap second announcements are not provided. Although information is transmitted only once per second, a device can synchronize its time very accurately with the transmitting device by using a phase-locked loop to synchronize to the carrier. Typical commercial devices will synchronize to within 1 microsecond using IRIG B timecodes.

== Timecode structure ==
IRIG timecode is made up of repeating frames, each containing 60 or 100 bits. The bits are numbered from 0 through 59 or 99.

At the start of each bit time, the IRIG timecode enables a signal (sends a carrier, raises the DC signal level, or transmits Manchester 1 bits). The signal is disabled (carrier attenuated at least 3×, DC signal level lowered, or Manchester 0 bits transmitted), at one of three times during the bit interval:
* After 0.2 of a bit time, to encode a binary 0
* After 0.5 of a bit time, to encode a binary 1
* After 0.8 of a bit time, to encode a marker bit

Bit 0 is the frame marker bit Pr. Every 10th bit starting with bit 9, 19, 29, ... 99 is also a marker bit, known as position identifiers P1, P2, ..., P9, P0. Thus, two marker bits in a row (P0 followed by Pr) marks the beginning of a frame. The frame encodes the time of the leading edge of the frame marker bit.

All other bits are data bits, which are transmitted as binary 0 if they have no other assigned purpose.

Generally, groups of 4 bits are used to encode BCD digits. Bits are assigned little-endian within fields.
* Bits 1–4 encode seconds, and bits 6–8 encode tens of seconds (0–59)
* Bits 10–13 encode minutes, and bits 15–17 encode tens of minutes (0–59)
* Bits 20–23 encode hours, and bits 25–26 encode tens of hours (0–23)
* Bits 30-33 encode day of year, 35-38 encode tens of days, and bits 40–41 encode hundreds of days (1–366)
* Bits 45–48 encode tenths of seconds (0–9)
* Bits 50–53 encode years, and bits 55–58 encode tens of years (0–99)
* Bits 80–88 and 90–97 encode &quot;straight binary seconds&quot; since 00:00 on the current day (0–86399, not BCD)

In IRIG G, bits 50–53 encode hundredths of seconds, and the years are encoded in bits 60–68.

Not all formats include all fields. Obviously those formats with 60-bit frames omit the straight binary seconds fields, and digits representing divisions less than one frame time (everything below hours, in the case of IRIG D) are always transmitted as 0.

No parity or check bits are included. Error detection can be achieved by comparing consecutive frames to see if they encode consecutive timestamps.

Unassigned 9-bit fields between consecutive marker bits are available for user-defined &quot;control functions&quot;. For example, the IEEE 1344 standard defines functions for bits 60–75.

== IRIG timecode ==

==IRIG J timecode==
IRIG standard 212-00 defines a different time-code, based on RS-232-style asynchronous serial communication.
The timecode consists of ASCII characters, each transmitted as 10 bits:
* 1 start bit
* 7 data bits
* 1 odd parity bit
* 1 stop bit
The on-time marker is the leading edge of the first start bit.

IRIG J-1 timecode consists of 15 characters (150 bit times), sent once per second at a baud rate of 300 or greater:

 &lt;SOH&gt;DDD:HH:MM:SS&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;

* SOH is the ASCII &quot;start of header&quot; code, with binary value codice_1.
* DDD is the ordinal date (day of year), from 1 to 366.
* HH, MM and SS are the time of the start bit.
* The code is terminated by a CR+LF pair.

At the end of the timecode, the serial line is idle until the start of the next code. There is no idle time between other characters.

IRIG J-2 timecode consists of 17 characters (170 bit times), sent 10 times per second at a baud rate of 2400 or greater:

 &lt;SOH&gt;DDD:HH:MM:SS.S&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;

This is the same, except that tenths of seconds are included.

The full-timecode specification is of the form &quot;IRIG J-&quot;xy&quot;&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; denotes the variant, and &quot;y&quot; denotes a baud rate of 75×2&quot;y&quot;.

Normally used combinations are J-12 through J-14 (300, 600, and 1200 baud), and J-25 through J-29 (2400 through 38400 baud).

<text>Hammonds Plains is a suburban area of the Halifax Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia, Canada, located 20 km northwest of Downtown Halifax.

==History==
Hammonds Plains was established as a settlement for United Empire Loyalists in 1786 along a road running from Birch Cove on Bedford Basin to St. Margaret&#x27;s Bay. Landowners voted to name the road after the popular outgoing Lt. Governor Andrew Snape Hamond. Further settlers arrived with disbanded soldiers from the Napoleonic Wars and Black Refugees from the War of 1812. The settlement was also the eastern end of the Old Annapolis Road intended to create a settled corridor and transportation link between Halifax and Annapolis Royal. While the Annapolis Road never developed, settlement opened up the a modest amount of viable farmland and more significantly developed many saw mills.

During the 1950s, Hammonds Plains was a potential location for a new international airport for Halifax, where the airport would&#x27;ve been constructed between the present day Glen Arbour Subdivision and Lucasville. The airport was ultimately built in Goffs, just south of Enfield, Nova Scotia.

==Geography==
The Government of Nova Scotia defines Hammonds Plains as adjacent to Bedford-and-Lucasville to the east; Upper Sackville-and-Middle Sackville to the north; Stillwater Lake, Timberlea, and Upper Tantallon to the south; and Upper Hammonds Plains to the west. The community is situated along the isthmus of the Chebucto Peninsula with its centre located along Highway 213 (Hammonds Plains Road).

The Hammonds Plains region is rich in small lakes and is a dormitory area for Halifax. Many homes lie on large unserviced lots, except in the Kingswood subdivision where 90% of the units have municipal water service and along the Hammonds Plains Road itself where there are several small businesses involved in automobile repair, waste management, physiotherapy clinics, and other maintenance activities. The population grew rapidly in the 1990s, particularly in subdivisions at the western end of the Hammonds Plains Road. Halifax&#x27;s water comes from Pockwock Lake which lies north of Hammonds Plains. The landmass of Hammonds Plains is approximately .

===Residential subdivisions===
*Brookline
*Cedarwood
*Glen Arbour
*Highland Park
*Kingswood
*Kingswood North
*Maplewood
*Perry Pond
*Uplands Park
*Voyageur Lakes
*White Hills

==Activities==

* Glen Arbour Golf Course, an 18-hole private championship golf course that hosts many tournaments, including the 2005 LPGA Canadian Women’s Open and the Telus World Skins Game in 2012.
* Hatfield Farm, a venue that contains a petting zoo and horseback riding, and is a popular spot for weddings and other functions. In 2021 and 2023 it was the site of Splashifax, a large inflatable water park.
* Atlantic Splash Adventure, a water park containing nine slides and several flat rides

An annual cycling event called Close To Home: The Tour of Hammonds Plains links the earliest settled areas with the new subdivisions.

==Demographics==
Hammonds Plains is a well-established community—however—the demographic information available from Statistics Canada pertains to the settled area (&quot;retired population centre&quot;) of Hammonds Plains Road, not the community of Hammonds Plains.

The settled area (&quot;retired population centre&quot;) of Hammonds Plains Road had a population of 1,819 people living in 595 of its 602 total private dwellings as of 2021, a decrease of from 1,859 people in 2016. Hammonds Plains Road had a population density of 572 people per km2. Including the subdivisions the population is approximately 12,000.

==Transportation==
Halifax Transit&#x27;s route 433 serves Hammonds Plains. This route travels from Tantallon, passes through Hammonds Plains, and continues to the Lacewood Terminal in Clayton Park. At Lacewood Terminal, passengers can transfer to buses destined for other areas of Halifax.

==Education==

<doc id="867582" wikidata="Q133101" url="?curid=867582" title="Laelia">
<text>Laelia is a small genus of 25 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). &quot;Laelia&quot; species are found in areas of subtropical or temperate climate in Central and South America, but mostly in Mexico. &quot;Laelia&quot; is abbreviated L. in the horticultural trade.

==Description==
Mostly epiphyte herbs (with a few lithophytes) with laterally compressed pseudobulbs. One to four leathery or fleshy leaves are born near the top of each pseudobulb, and can be broadly ovate to oblong. The inflorescence is a terminal raceme (rarely a panicle). The flowers have 8 pollinia; petals are of a thinner texture than the sepals; sepals and petals are of similar shape, but the sepals being narrower; the lip or labellum is free from the arched flower column.

==Distribution==
Species of &quot;Laelia&quot; can be found from western Mexico south to Bolivia, from sea level to mountain forests.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Laelia&quot; was described as part of subfamily Epidendroideae by John Lindley. Brazilian &quot;Laelias&quot;, after being classified for several years under &quot;Sophronitis&quot;, have now been placed in the genus &quot;Cattleya&quot;. Moreover, species formerly placed in the genus &quot;Schomburgkia&quot; have been moved either to the genus &quot;Laelia&quot; or &quot;Myrmecophila&quot;.

===Species===
&quot;Laelia&quot; comprises the following species:
==Ecology==
Species in this genus are found in forests from sea level to mountain habitats above 2000 m. Species from above 2000 m of elevation like &quot;L. albida&quot;, and &quot;L. autumnalis&quot; are adapted to temperate climates and can be grown outdoors in places like the Mexican Plateau, California and other subtropical areas with cool summers.

&quot;Laelia&quot; is one of the orchid genera known to use crassulacean acid metabolism photosynthesis, which reduces evapotranspiration during daylight because carbon dioxide is collected at night.

==Cultivation==
Laelias can be grown fastened to tree trunks, as long as the tree won&#x27;t cast a deep shadow; they can also be fastened to a piece of branch or a slab of cork so they can be hung in a place facing south. The growing medium must have good drainage, rapidly drying after watering; pieces of pine bark, charcoal or pebbles are good choices. If grown mounted they definitely need approximately 50–70% humidity, while cooler temperatures increase the blooming process. Watering can be done 2–3 times a week, but with lower frequency in winter. Fertilization can be done with a very dilute solution, twice a month especially during growing season (May to November in Northern Hemisphere).

=== Nothogenera ===
Hybrids of &quot;Laelia&quot; with other orchid genera are placed in the following nothogenera (this list is incomplete):
* × &quot;Laeliocattleya&quot; (&quot;Lc.&quot;) = &quot;Cattleya&quot; × &quot;Laelia&quot;
* × &quot;Laeliocatonia&quot; (&quot;Lctna.&quot;) = &quot;Broughtonia&quot; × &quot;Cattleya&quot; × &quot;Laelia&quot;
* × &quot;Laeliocatarthron&quot; (&quot;Lcr.&quot;) = &quot;Cattleya&quot; × &quot;Caularthron&quot; × &quot;Laelia&quot;
* × &quot;Sophrolaelia&quot; (&quot;Sl.&quot;) = &quot;Laelia&quot; × &quot;Sophronitis&quot;
&quot;Rhyncholaelia&quot; is a distinct genus rather than a nothogenus.

<doc id="867583" wikidata="Q528949" url="?curid=867583" title="Harmony Korine">
<text>Harmony Korine (born January 4, 1973) is an American filmmaker, actor, photographer, artist, and author. His methods feature an erratic, loose and transgressive aesthetic, exploring taboo themes and incorporating experimental techniques, and works with art, music, fashion and advertising.

Korine&#x27;s career began when he wrote the screenplay for the Larry Clark film &quot;Kids&quot; (1995), which was followed by his directorial debut, &quot;Gummo&quot; (1997). His films typically explore unconventional narratives and themes of dysfunctional families, and also include &quot;Mister Lonely&quot; (2007), &quot;Spring Breakers&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Beach Bum&quot; (2019). 

Korine founded EDGLRD, a creative and technology company, in 2023, with his film &quot;Aggro Dr1ft&quot; (2023) being one of the company&#x27;s first projects. 

==Early life==
Korine was born to a Jewish family in Bolinas, California, the son of Eve and Sol Korine. His father was an Iranian Jewish immigrant. His father was a tapdancer and produced documentaries for PBS in the 1970s about an &quot;array of colorful Southern characters&quot;; he would take Korine to carnivals and circuses and taught him how to use a Bolex camera. As a child, Korine watched movies with his father, who rented Buster Keaton films for Korine and took him to see Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Even Dwarfs Started Small&quot; (1970) in the theater. Korine reminisced that &quot;I knew there was a poetry in cinema that I had never seen before that was so powerful.&quot;

Korine spent his early childhood in the San Francisco Bay Area living with his family on a commune. In the early 1980s, they relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, where he attended Hillsboro High School before moving to New York City to live with his grandmother. As a teenager, Korine spent his summers in San Francisco, &quot;skateboarding, living on rooftops, running away from my parents, getting in fights. You know, girls. At that point I was just getting into movies, but the idea of making films happened later in high school.&quot; He began frequenting revival theaters, watching films by John Cassavetes, Werner Herzog, Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Altman, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Alan Clarke. In an interview with Bruce LaBruce, Korine briefly mentioned that he studied Business Administration in college. Other sources state that he studied Dramatic Writing at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University for one semester before dropping out to pursue a career as a professional skateboarder.

==Career==
===&quot;Kids&quot; and &quot;Gummo&quot; (1994–1998)===
Korine was skating with friends in Washington Square Park when he met photographer Larry Clark. Impressed, the photographer asked him to compose a script about skaters and to include in the plot a teenage AIDS experience. Korine told Clark, &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting all my life to write this story.&quot; Within three weeks, Korine wrote &quot;Kids&quot;, a film about 24 hours in the sex- and drug-filled lives of several Manhattan teenagers in New York City during the AIDS crisis. &quot;Kids&quot; received mixed reviews at the time of its release in 1995, but has since become a significant cult film. Among others, the film features Chloë Sevigny and Rosario Dawson in their first movie roles. The film, while controversial, jumpstarted Korine&#x27;s career. This put him into contact with film producer Cary Woods who budgeted about $1 million to produce &quot;Gummo&quot;, Korine&#x27;s personal vision.

In 1997, Korine wrote and directed &quot;Gummo&quot;, a film based on life in Xenia, Ohio, a town devastated by a tornado in the early 1970s. Forgoing conventional narrative, &quot;Gummo&quot; is a nonlinear, fragmented series of sketches written by Korine. Only five experienced actors worked on the movie; much of the cast was found during preproduction in Tennessee. The film is notable for having unsettling, often bizarre scenes, as well as its dreamlike soundtrack, which strengthens the disconcerting atmosphere. It features &quot;an eclectic soundtrack including death metal, Madonna and Roy Orbison.

It premiered at the 24th Telluride Film Festival on August 29, 1997. During the screening, numerous people got up and left during the initial cat drowning sequence. Three months later, Werner Herzog called Korine to give praise to the film overall, especially the bacon taped to the wall during the bathtub scene. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;When I saw a piece of fried bacon fixed to the bathroom wall in &quot;Gummo&quot;, it knocked me off my chair. [Korine&#x27;s] a very clear voice of a generation of filmmakers that is taking a new position. It&#x27;s not going to dominate world cinema, but so what?&quot;

Although a majority of mainstream critics derided it as an unintelligible mess, it won top prizes at that year&#x27;s Venice Film Festival and earned Korine the respect of noted filmmakers such as Gus Van Sant, among others. It has been called &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve seen in a while – maybe ever&quot; – and that &quot;if you&#x27;re the kind of person who claims to be frustrated by the predictability of commercial filmmaking, [it presents] a rare opportunity to put your money where your mouth is.&quot;

In 1998, Korine released &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank Pt II&quot;, a 40-minute three-screen collage featuring a boy burying his dog, kids in satanic dress vomiting on a Bible, and a man in blackface dancing and singing &quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot;. It utilizes some of the same actors and themes as &quot;Gummo&quot;, and can be considered a companion piece as the film utilises footage that didn&#x27;t make the final cut of &quot;Gummo&quot;. The film &quot;further disgusted critics&quot; and solidified his status as a notoriously shocking and experimental director.

===&quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; and &quot;Ken Park&quot; (1999–2003)===
&quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot;, released in 1999, included a signed Dogme 95 manifesto. While it broke a number of the movement&#x27;s basic tenets, Lars von Trier lauded Korine&#x27;s ability to interpret the rules creatively.

The story is told from the perspective of a young man suffering from untreated schizophrenia, played by Ewen Bremner, as he tries to understand his deteriorating world. Julien&#x27;s abusive and arguably hypersensitive father is played by Werner Herzog. At one point, Korine was to play the son, but he backed down and was replaced by Bremner.

Like &quot;Gummo&quot; and &quot;Kids&quot;, it too has since become something of a cult classic, a go-to film for those seeking cinema that is, as Roger Ebert said in his three star review, &quot;shocking for most moviegoers&quot;, unlike &quot;the slick aboveground indie productions&quot; that are now the norm.

In 2000, &quot;The Devil, The Sinner, and His Journey&quot; premiered, which featured Korine in black metal corpsepaint as O. J. Simpson and Johnny Depp as Kato Kaelin. That same year, Korine directed the short film Korine Tap for Stop For a Minute, a series of short films commissioned by Dazed &amp; Confused magazine and FilmFour Lab. The film featured Korine tap dancing while wearing blackface.

In 2002, Larry Clark made &quot;Ken Park&quot;, based on a script Korine had written several years earlier. The film, another adult tale of youth gone awry, was not distributed in the United States. At the time of its release, Clark and Korine had long since parted ways, and Korine had no involvement in its production.

In 2003, he made the television documentary &quot;Above the Below&quot; about his friend and collaborator David Blaine and his 44-day stunt in a park over the bank of River Thames in London inside a suspended plexiglas box. A documentary commissioned by Sky Television and Channel 4, it also includes jokes, visual poetry, and music. In addition, Korine has worked with Blaine on a number of Blaine&#x27;s specials.

He first met his wife, Rachel (Simon) Korine, a 17-year-old from Nashville, around this time.

===&quot;Mister Lonely&quot; and &quot;Trash Humpers&quot; (2007–2009)===
His third feature film, &quot;Mister Lonely&quot;, was co-written by his brother, Avi Korine, and starred Diego Luna, Samantha Morton, Denis Lavant, Anita Pallenberg, David Blaine, Werner Herzog and Mal Whiteley. The movie was released in 2008 and debuted at Cannes. His largest film, with a budget of $8.2 million, it received mixed reviews and earned $386,915 in its first 9 months.

The film is the story of &quot;a young American man lost in Paris. He scratches out a living as a Michael Jackson look-alike, dancing in the streets, in public parks, at tourist spots and trade shows. Different from everyone else, he feels as if he&#x27;s floating between two worlds. During a show at a geriatric home Michael Jackson meets Marilyn Monroe. Haunted by her angelic beauty he follows her to a commune in the Highlands, joining her husband Charlie Chaplin and her daughter Shirley Temple. The commune is a place where everyone is famous and &quot;no-one gets old&quot;. Here, The Pope, The Queen of the United Kingdom, Madonna, James Dean and other impersonators build a stage in the hope that the world will visit and watch them perform. Everything is beautiful. Until the world shifts, and reality intrudes on their utopian dream.&quot;

Korine also appeared in the 2007 documentary film &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; in which his life and career were one focus of the film, along with other artists such as Mike Mills, Shepard Fairey, Margaret Kilgallen, Jo Jackson and Barry McGee. In the documentary, Korine discusses his motivation as an artist and filmmaker, as well as his inspiration for creating films he has never seen. Footage also appears from one of Korine&#x27;s rare, early, and untitled short films, which preceded his work on &quot;Kids&quot;.

In 2008 Korine was signed to MJZ for worldwide commercial representation.

On 6 September 2009 Korine&#x27;s film &quot;Trash Humpers&quot; premiered as part of the Visions section of the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Despite being a work of fiction, the film went on to win the top award at the prominent European documentary film festival CPH:DOX – Copenhagen International Documentary Festival – in November 2009.

In March 2011, Korine released a short film entitled &quot;Umshini Wam&quot;, which is a popular Zulu struggle song meaning &quot;bring me my machine gun&quot;. The film starred Ninja and Yo-Landi of Die Antwoord. In September 2011, Korine released a short film entitled &quot;Snowballs&quot;, sponsored by the Proenza Schouler fashion label.

===&quot;Spring Breakers,&quot; &quot;The Beach Bum&quot; (2012–2019)===
Korine&#x27;s next project was the crime drama &quot;Spring Breakers&quot;, which was produced in 2012 in Florida, and starred James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Korine&#x27;s wife, Rachel Korine. In looking at early scenes being filmed and in speaking toward the plot, cast, and earlier works of the filmmaker, &quot;Indiewire&quot; wrote &quot;this might be the weirdest movie the director has ever made simply by nature of being totally unlike his previous work.&quot; &quot;That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways may seem like a cop-out, but only if you believe that the role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold&quot;, wrote &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Principal filming wrapped up on March 30, 2012. The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. &quot;Spring Breakers&quot; received its world premiere at the 2012 Venice International Film Festival, and later was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival before being released to the general public in March 2013.

Korine&#x27;s feature &quot;The Beach Bum&quot; was released in 2019, starring Matthew McConaughey as Moondog, Isla Fisher as his wife Minnie, Martin Lawrence as Captain Wack, and Snoop Dogg as Lingerie.

=== EDGLRD projects (2023-present) ===
In 2023, Korine released &quot;Aggro Dr1ft&quot; starring Catalan actor Jordi Mollà and Travis Scott. The film premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival, and was produced and distributed by his company EDGLRD.

Korine&#x27;s next feature film, also with EDGLRD, is &quot;Baby Invasion&quot;, shot from a first-person shooter perspective.

== Artistry and reception ==

=== Style and aesthetic ===
Korine has not primarily regarded himself as a director, instead describing a &quot;unified aesthetic&quot; that his filmography explores as much as his art and photography. Much of his filmography, including his screenplays, explores themes of dysfunctional families, mental disorders, abuse, hedonism, poverty and various subcultures, with unreliable narrators and a collage of perspectives. This is often presented experimentally, with many of Korine&#x27;s films incorporating Polaroids, Super 8, 35mm film and VHS recordings, such as in &quot;Gummo&quot; and &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot;. Improvisation is also an important filmmaking technique for Korine, as a way to maintain his films as &quot;living thing[s].&quot; Korine has described the social, psychological and subcultural aspects of his films as constituting what he describes as the &quot;American Landscape&quot;.

Korine credited tap-dance, vaudeville and minstrelsy as influences on his work in the 1990s and 2000s, with him especially naming the comedy of Fanny Brice, Eddie Cantor and Al Jolson as inspirations for his intentionally stilted style of presentation and humor. Like vaudeville, the style of Korine&#x27;s work is presentational and works purely by thematic association. He has compared with this to viewing picture books of assorted photos, which would be seemingly devoid of context, but because they are compiled and presented in succession, a narrative is formed, and Korine has said that &quot;Gummo&quot; and his subsequent films were written in this fashion, striving to retain a &quot;margin of the undefined.&quot; In 2009, he summarized an ideal setting in his aesthetic as &quot;an abandoned parking lot and a soiled sofa on the edge [...] with a street lamp off to the side. America seems like a series of abandoned parking lots, streetlights and abandoned sofas.&quot; Ensuing from this, the setting appears frequently in his film &quot;Trash Humpers&quot; (2009).

===Influences===
In 1997, Korine&#x27;s favorite writers were listed as the humorists James Thurber and S. J. Perelman, as well as the Southern Gothic novelist Flannery O&#x27;Connor. He also credited the philosopher Walter Benjamin as an influence. In recent years, Korine has praised rapper and collaborator Gucci Mane.

Korine has noted British filmmaker Alan Clarke as a strong inspiration on his filmmaking, especially with regards to his realism and use of extensive scenes. In 1999, he listed his top ten films as &quot;Pixote&quot; by Héctor Babenco, &quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; by Terrence Malick, &quot;Fat City&quot; by John Huston, &quot;Stroszek&quot; by Werner Herzog, &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot; and &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; by John Cassavetes, &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; by Robert Altman, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; by Dennis Hopper and &quot;Hail Mary&quot; by Jean-Luc Godard.

=== Criticism and praise ===
Despite the scorn of a majority of mainstream reviewers, Korine has won festival prizes at Venice and Rotterdam among others. Established directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Gus Van Sant are also outspoken proponents of Korine&#x27;s work, with Van Sant saying &quot;Gummo&quot; &quot;changed his life&quot; and Bertolucci saying Korine &quot;created a revolution in the language of cinema.&quot;

Korine was initially frequently labeled as an enfant terrible and was often accused of exploitation and self-indulgence; he responded in 1997, asking &quot;How can an artist be expected not to be self-indulgent? That&#x27;s the whole thing that&#x27;s wrong with filmmaking today [...] To me, art is one man&#x27;s voice, one idea, one point-of-view, coming from one person.&quot; Korine feels there is no need to justify or explain the images he puts to the screen, clarifying that they are simply the result of &quot;a cinema of passion and obsession.&quot; He has added that &quot;I mostly just make things to entertain myself and at the same time hope that there&#x27;s some type of audience that likes what I&#x27;m doing.&quot; Korine has also stated that &quot;film is like a dead art because of people not taking chances&quot;, and has shown his preference for &quot;auteurist works&quot;. He stated in 1999 that &quot;In another ten or fifteen years, the people that understand and appreciate &quot;Gummo&quot; or my work will be in positions of power&quot;, declaring that the culture presented in his art was going to become more prominent.

Korine has said that his films are created with the premise that if there is at least one image that sticks with you after viewing a film and makes you change your perspective on cinema, then it is a success. Roger Ebert subsequently said in his review of &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; that &quot;Korine, who at 25 is one of the most untamed new directors, belongs on the list with Godard, Cassavetes, Herzog, Warhol, Tarkovsky, Brakhage and others who smash conventional movies and reassemble the pieces ... Harmony Korine is the real thing, an innovative and gifted filmmaker whose work forces us to see on his terms.&quot;

==Other ventures==

===Books===
Korine has published a number of books. &quot;A Crack Up at the Race Riots&quot;, an experimental book of fragments which he jokingly described in press appearances and interviews as his attempt to write &quot;the Great American Choose Your Own Adventure novel&quot;, was published in 1998 by Drag City.

The screenplay for &quot;Kids&quot; (1995) was published by Grove Press the same year, followed by a collection of the screenplays for &quot;Gummo&quot; (1997), &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; (1999) and an unfinished screenplay named &quot;Jokes&quot; in &quot;Collected Screenplays&quot;, published by Faber and Faber in 2002. The screenplay for &quot;Mister Lonely&quot; (2007) was released by Swiss publisher Nieves with photographs by Rachel Korine and Brent Stewart in 2008. The majority of these books differ substantially from the movies eventually produced. Drag City also published a collection of his fanzines called &quot;The Collected Fanzines&quot; with skateboarder and writer Mark Gonzales in 2008.

===Art===
Korine released a number of photographic collections, usually in conjunction with gallery exhibits. In 1998 he published &quot;The Bad Son&quot; in conjunction with Taka Ishii gallery in Tokyo, documenting his various photo shoots with Macaulay Culkin. In 2002, &quot;Pass the Bitch Chicken&quot; was released, a collaboration with artist Christopher Wool, which consists of Korine&#x27;s photographs heavily edited by Korine and Wool. In 2009 he published &quot;Pigxote&quot; in conjunction with the Vanderbilt University Fine Arts Gallery and released by Nieves. The university describes the exhibition, which ran through February 26, 2009, as culling &quot;together a number of photographs from Korine&#x27;s private files in order to reveal a side of the artist&#x27;s creative process that remains largely unexamined. Depicting an unnamed, mysterious young girl moving through a televised landscape of shifting contexts, Pigxote further illustrates Korine&#x27;s interest in replacing plot lines and expected narrative tropes with intuitively arranged &quot;experiential moments.&quot; They also provide a unique insight into the poetic mind of Nashville&#x27;s most compelling prodigal son.&quot; In 2003 his works were presented at an exhibition at agnès b&#x27;s Galerie du jour in Paris, with whom Korine has often been associated. In 2010, Korine collaborated with New York Visual Artist Bill Saylor on the book &quot;Ho Bags.&quot; The book consists of drawing and paintings in which Korine and Saylor drew over each other&#x27;s works. In 2011 Korine collaborated with the New York brand Supreme, releasing a set of two skateboard decks featuring original artworks by Korine. Since 2014, Korine has taken part in twelve exhibitions at the Gagosian gallery in various locations, including New York, London, Beverly Hills and Geneva. Seven of these have been solo exhibitions. In 2019 the Gagosian featured a collection of works by Korine titled &quot;Young Twitchy&quot;. These works consisted of photographs taken by the artist, mostly around his home in Florida, which were then recreated in oil paint and augmented with different characters. In 2023, The Golfer’s Journal featured a collection of works by Korine titled &quot;Wormburner&quot;, consisting of portraits of U.S. Presidents playing golf.

===Commercials===
Korine directed a commercial for Dior Addict Fragrance in 2014. In February 2020, Korine directed and photographed a Gucci tailoring campaign starring Tyler, the Creator, A$AP Rocky and Iggy Pop. In 2021, Korine directed a commercial for 7-Eleven featuring the song &quot;Fred Sanford&quot; by hip hop duo Marlowe, which subsequently went viral.

===Music===
Korine has directed a number of music videos for artists such as Sonic Youth, Will Oldham, Cat Power and the Black Keys. In addition, he sang on Oldham&#x27;s &quot;Ease Down The Road&quot; (2001). In 1999 Korine and Brian Degraw of Gang Gang Dance released a one-off album, &quot;SSAB Songs&quot;. He also co-authored the lyrics of Björk&#x27;s &quot;Harm of Will&quot; from her album &quot;Vespertine&quot; (2001), and co-wrote Lana Del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Florida Kilos&quot; which is featured on the deluxe edition of her album &quot;Ultraviolence&quot; (2014).

Korine directed the music video for Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Needed Me&quot; which was released on April 21, 2016. In the same year, Korine directed a Supreme commercial starring rapper Gucci Mane (who had previously appeared in &quot;Spring Breakers&quot;), and appeared in the music video for Gucci Mane and Travis Scott&#x27;s &quot;Last Time&quot;.

Korine directed the music video for Bladee&#x27;s &quot;ONE SECOND&quot; featuring Yung Lean, which was released on April 27, 2024 in collaboration with EDGLRD.

=== EDGLRD ===
Korine founded EDGLRD, a creative and technology company, in 2023. The company is based in Miami, Florida.

==Personal life==

Korine met Chloë Sevigny in Washington Square Park in New York City during her senior year of high school in 1993. The two became close friends, which resulted in her being cast in the low-budget independent film &quot;Kids&quot; (1995). They had a romantic relationship that ended in the early 2000s though they are still friends. He is now married to actress Rachel Korine, with whom he has three children.

In 2009, Korine received criticism for signing a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

<text>David Ritz Finkelstein (July 19, 1929 – January 24, 2016) was an emeritus professor of physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

== Biography ==
Born in New York City, Finkelstein obtained his Ph.D. in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1953 and taught at Stevens Institute of Technology through 1960, while he also held a Ford Foundation Fellowship at the European Organization for Nuclear Research from 1959 to 1960. From 1964 to 1976, he was professor of physics at Yeshiva University. He became a member of the faculty at Georgia Tech in 1980.

David Finkelstein was the first, in 1958, who identified Schwarzschild&#x27;s solution of the Einstein field equations as corresponding to a region in space from which nothing escapes. In 1959, Finkelstein and Charles W. Misner found the gravitational kink, a topological defect in the gravitational metric, whose quantum theory could exhibit spin 1/2. The simplest kink exhibited an easily understood event horizon that led him to recognize the one in the Schwarzschild metric and eliminate its coordinate singularity. In essence, Finkelstein determined that whatever falls past the Schwarzschild radius into a black hole cannot escape it; the membrane is one-directional. This important work influenced the decisions of Roger Penrose and John Archibald Wheeler to accept the physical existence of event horizons and black holes.

Most of Finkelstein&#x27;s work is directed toward a quantum theory of space-time structure. He early on accepted the conclusion of John von Neumann that anomalies of quantum mechanical measurement are anomalies of the logic of quantum mechanical systems. Therefore, he formed quantum analogues of set theory, the standard language for classical space-time structures, and proposed that space-time is a quantum set of space-time quanta dubbed &quot;chronons&quot;, a form of quantum computer with spins for quantum bits, as a quantum version of the cellular automaton of von Neumann. His early quantum space-times proving unphysical, he later studied chronons with a regularized form of Bose–Einstein statistics due to Tchavdar D. Palev.

He investigated ball lightning with Julio Rubinstein and James R. Powell.
They concluded that ball lightning is most likely a wandering St. Elmo&#x27;s fire, a low-temperature soliton in the atmospheric electric current flow.

He also put forward an in-depth interpretation of the engraving &quot;Melencolia I&quot; of Albrecht Dürer.

Finkelstein died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in Atlanta on January 24, 2016, aged 86.

== Universal relativity ==
Influenced by his discussions of Buddhist philosophy at the Mind and Life dialogues, Finkelstein developed a philosophical theory of &quot;universal relativity&quot; which he thought might help advance physics. According to Finkelstein:
The Buddhist principle that all is empty is understood by some as the principle that all is relative (Thurman 1993). This universal relativity principle is more embracing though less structured than Einstein’s general relativity principle, which still admits many absolutes. The major changes in physics in this century have been extensions of relativity at one level or another, and I think a further extension is due, at an even deeper level of physics than the previous. Philosophical inquiry has aided such extensions before, and it could do so again. A philosophical argument for a universal relativity could be a useful guide for future physics.

<text>[[The Most Honourable|The Most Hon.]] Dermot Richard Claud Chichester, 7th Marquess of Donegall (18 April 1916 – 19 April 2007), known as [[The Honourable|the Hon.]] Dermot Chichester from 1924 to 1953, and as Baron Templemore from 1953 to 1975, was a British soldier, landowner and member of the House of Lords. Lord Donegall was usually known to his family and friends as Dermey Donegall.

==Biography==
Lord Donegall was the second son of the 4th Baron Templemore, whom he succeeded in the barony. He was educated at Harrow and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

He served in the Second World War as a captain with the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars in Egypt. He was reported missing in action and believed to have been killed, but had been captured in Libya in November 1942 during the North African campaign. He remained a prisoner of war in Italy until escaping in June 1944. He was promoted major that year, and retired from the British Army in 1949, but served for several years with the Leicestershire Yeomanry.

His elder brother, Arthur, having been killed in 1942 serving with the Coldstream Guards, Chichester succeeded his father in his several titles in 1953. In 1975, he also succeeded a distant cousin to become the 7th Marquess of Donegall, being the descendant of the 1st Baron Templemore, grandson of Arthur Chichester, 1st Marquess of Donegall. He was also Lord High Admiral of Lough Neagh.

Lord Donegall became a member of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms in 1966, and was its Standard Bearer from 1984 to 1986. He was appointed LVO in 1986, and was for many years an active member of the Conservative Monday Club. In 1981, he became Grandmaster of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, a post he held until 1992. Lord Donegall also served as master of the Wexford Hounds. He bred horses, including The Proclamation, winner of the Punchestown champion hurdle in 1989, and Dunbrody Millar, winner of the Topham Trophy at Aintree in 2007.

In 1946, he married Lady Josceline Gabrielle Legge (1918–1995), daughter of the 7th Earl of Dartmouth. They had a son, Patrick Chichester (born in 1952, and who used the courtesy title of Earl of Belfast from 1975 to 2007), and two daughters, Lady Jennifer (1949–2013) and Lady Juliet (b. 1954). The Marquess lived at the family home of Dunbrody Park in Arthurstown in the southwest of County Wexford.

<text>The Battle of Revolax () took place on 27 April 1808 at Revonlahti, (now part of Siikajoki) in Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland, when the Swedish supreme commander Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor and the Savolax brigade under Colonel Johan Adam Cronstedt, a total of about 2,250 Swedes surprised an isolated Russian column of about 1,700 men under Major General Michail Leontievich Bulatov. The Russians were surrounded and tried to cut their way through but failed and the Russian general Bulatov was taken prisoner by the Swedes.

This, and the preceding battle of Siikajoki nine days earlier, are considered very important events since they are the first Swedish victories after about 2 months of planned retreat. The next battle took place at Pulkkila on 2 May.

==The summer offensive begins==
The Swedish commander Klingspor continued his retreat towards Oulu after the Swedish victory at the Battle of Siikajoki. They were closely followed by the Russians. A Russian fore, commanded by Bulatov, had set camp at the village of Revonlahti. Cronstedt prepared an assault to drive them away. He led a force of some 1,800 men through the night of 26 and 27 April. The Swedes could hear the sound of musket fire to the north, where Adlercreutz were fighting against the forward Russian unit which had been advancing on him. However Adlercreutz managed to stop the advance.

Cronstedt and his 4th Brigade prepared themselves for the battles that were to be fought the next day. Bulatov and his Russian troops were entrenched inside the village. The Russian units consisted also of the Mogilev Regiment and the Perm Regiment. The Russians had three guns. In the morning of 27 April the Swedish attacked with two equally strong columns: the right column was led by Gustav Aminoff. It consisted of two battalions from the Savolax Infantry Regiment, the third battalion from the Savolax Jaeger Regiment, the second battalion of the Carelian Jaeger Corps and two 3-pound guns; the left column was led by Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Ludwig Christiern and consisted of two battalions from the Savolax Infantry Regiment, the first battalion from the Savolax Jaegar Regiment, the first battalion from the Carelian Jaeger Corps, and two 3-pounder guns.

The right column managed to sweep away all the Russian resistance and were advancing along the river, towards the village. At the same time, the left column prepared its troops to assault the vicarage, where Bulatov had set up his headquarters and gathered most of his troops. The attack on the vicarage became a difficult operation, as the Russians defended themselves viciously. The Swedes finally stormed the building at 10 a.m. and a bloody close-combat battle ensued.

More than 94 Swedes and 500 Russians had died, were wounded or captured when the violence finally ended. The Swedish victory at Revolax meant the end of the first Swedish retreat. Klingspor, who was known to be a cautious and sceptical man, acted against his temperament, and ordered a counter-offensive towards the south. The Savolax Brigade, which was led by av Sandels, and of whom Cronstedt&#x27;s men were a part of, were to fight a bloody war in the southern parts of Finland. Sandel&#x27;s newly formed 5th Brigade would soon take commence resistance fighting in the eastern parts of Finland. The Swedish counter offensive had begun and it would continue all the summer of 1808.

<doc id="867607" wikidata="Q708088" url="?curid=867607" title="Battle of Corunna">
<text>The Battle of Corunna (or &quot;A Coruña&quot;, &quot;La Corunna&quot;, &quot;La Coruña&quot; or &quot;La Corogne&quot;), in Spain known as Battle of Elviña, took place on 16 January 1809, when a French corps under Marshal of the Empire Jean de Dieu Soult attacked a British army under Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore. The battle took place amidst the Peninsular War, which was a part of the wider Napoleonic Wars. It was a result of a French campaign, led by Napoleon, which had defeated the Spanish armies and caused the British army to withdraw to the coast following an unsuccessful attempt by Moore to attack Soult&#x27;s corps and divert the French army.

Doggedly pursued by the French under Soult, the British made a retreat across northern Spain while their rearguard fought off repeated French attacks. Both armies suffered extremely from the harsh winter conditions. Much of the British army, excluding the elite Light Brigade under Robert Craufurd, suffered from a loss of order and discipline during the retreat. When the British eventually reached the port of Corunna on the northern coast of Galicia in Spain, a few days ahead of the French, they found their transport ships had not arrived. The fleet arrived after a couple of days and the British were in the midst of embarking when the French forces launched an attack. They forced the British to fight another battle before being able to depart for England.

In the resulting action, the British held off French attacks until nightfall, when both armies disengaged. British forces resumed their embarkation overnight; the last transports left in the morning under French cannon fire. But the port cities of Corunna and Ferrol, as well as northern Spain, were captured and occupied by the French. During the battle, Sir John Moore, the British commander, was mortally wounded, dying after learning that his men had successfully repelled the French attacks.

==Background==
The Corunna campaign started with the Battle of Cardedeu.

===Prelude===

In early October 1808, following the scandal in Britain over the Convention of Sintra and the recall of the generals Dalrymple, Burrard and Wellesley, Sir John Moore took command of the 30,000-man British force in Portugal. In addition, Sir David Baird in command of an expedition of reinforcements out of Falmouth consisting of 150 transports carrying between 12,000 and 13,000 men, convoyed by HMS &quot;Louie&quot;, HMS &quot;Amelia&quot; and HMS &quot;Champion&quot;, entered Corunna Harbour on 13 October. By November 1808 the British army, led by Moore, advanced into Spain with orders to assist the Spanish armies in their struggle against the invading forces of Napoleon.

After the surrender of a French army corps at Bailén and the loss of Portugal, Napoleon was convinced of the peril he faced in Spain. Deeply disturbed by news of Sintra, the Emperor remarked,
The French, all but masters of Spain in June, stood with their backs to the Pyrenees, clutching at Navarre and Catalonia. They did not know if even these two footholds could be maintained in the face of a Spanish attack. By October French strength in Spain, including garrisons, was about 75,000 soldiers. They were facing 86,000 Spanish troops with Spain&#x27;s 35,000 British allies en route.

However, no attack came. The Spanish social fabric, shaken by the shock of rebellion, gave way to crippling social and political tensions; the patriots stood divided on every question and their nascent war effort suffered accordingly. With the fall of the monarchy, constitutional power devolved to local juntas. These institutions interfered with the army and the business of war, undermined the tentative central government taking shape in Madrid, and in some cases proved almost as dangerous to each other as to the French. The British Army in Portugal, meanwhile, was itself immobilized by logistical problems and bogged down in administrative disputes, and did not budge.

Months of inaction had passed at the front, the revolution having &quot;temporarily crippled Patriot Spain at the very moment when decisive action could have changed the whole course of the war&quot;. While the allies inched forward, a vast consolidation of bodies and bayonets from the far reaches of the French Empire brought 100,000 veterans of the Grande Armée into Spain, led in person by Napoleon and his Marshals. With his &quot;Armée d&#x27;Espagne&quot; of 278,670 men drawn up on the Ebro, facing a scant 80,000 raw, disorganized Spanish troops, the Emperor announced to the Spanish deputies: Starting in October 1808 Napoleon led the French on a brilliant offensive involving a massive double envelopment of the Spanish lines. The attack began in November and has been described as &quot;an avalanche of fire and steel&quot;.

For a time the British army was dangerously dispersed, with Baird&#x27;s newly arrived contingent at Astorga to the north, Moore at Salamanca and Hope to the east near Madrid with all Moore&#x27;s cavalry and artillery. The main army, under Moore, had advanced to Salamanca and were joined by Hope&#x27;s detachment on 3 December when Moore received news that the Spanish forces had suffered several defeats. He considered that to avoid disaster he must give up and retreat back to Portugal.

Moore, before retreating, received intelligence of Soult&#x27;s 16,000-man corps&#x27; scattered and isolated position at Carrión and that the French were unaware of the British army&#x27;s position. On 15 December, he seized this opportunity to advance on the French near Madrid, hoping that to defeat Soult and possibly divert Napoleon&#x27;s forces. A junction with Baird on 20 December, advancing from Corunna, raised Moore&#x27;s strength to 23,500 infantry, 2,400 cavalry and 60 guns and he opened his attack with a successful raid by Lieutenant-General Paget&#x27;s cavalry on the French picquets at Sahagún on 21 December. However, Moore failed to follow up against a surprised Soult. Moore halted for two days and allowed Soult to concentrate his corps.

==Prelude==

===Retreat to Corunna===

Once Moore made his presence known Napoleon responded with customary swiftness and decisiveness. The Spanish were defeated and no longer an organized threat. His army was generally concentrated while the enemy was dispersed. With the initiative firmly in his grasp, Napoleon seized the chance to destroy Britain&#x27;s only field army. When Moore realized he was in serious danger of being trapped he called off his advance and went into headlong retreat. This epic dash and chase would cover more than , during which the British cavalry and the infantry of the Light Brigade were used to cover the movements of Moore&#x27;s army after their retreat began on 25 December. This saw them engage the French in small rearguard clashes, including defeating a French cavalry force and capturing General Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes at Benavente before entering the mountains of Galicia, and another at Cacabelos where General Colbert-Chabanais was killed by a British rifleman.

The retreat of the British, closely followed by their French pursuers, took them through mountainous terrain in dreadful conditions of cold and snow and was marked by exhausting marches, privation, and suffering. Moore was joined at Astorga by General Romana leading the remnants of Blake&#x27;s Spanish forces and Romana proposed they make a stand. However, with Napoleon closing in, Moore declined and continued his retreat north while Romana went west towards Portugal. On the march between Astorga and Betanzos the British army lost 3,000 men with 500 more left in hospitals at Astorga and Villafranca.

Napoleon had attempted to speedily catch the British and force them to fight. He led the French army over 10 days by forced marches and in spite of winter blizzard conditions reached Astorga on 1 January with 80,000 men. Napoleon manoeuvred to cut Moore off from a retreat to Portugal. Moore had already planned that he would have to be ready to make a run for the coast. On 28 November Moore had ordered his Corunna contingent under Baird to embark from Vigo while the main British army was to fall back on Portugal but by 28 December he had decided to embark the whole army at Vigo. Abandoning Astorga on 30 December, he would manage to keep ahead of the pursuing French and avoid a major battle. Moore ordered Crawford and two brigades as well as the troop transport ships to the port of Vigo. Napoleon wrote to his brother Joseph on 31 December: When it was clear that he could not bring Moore to battle, Napoleon left the pursuit of the British to Soult&#x27;s corps with Marshal Ney in support and took the bulk of the army, some 45,000 men, back to Madrid. Napoleon decided to leave Spain to attend to other pressing matters; the Austrians were about to declare war on France, and would soon invade Italy and Bavaria.

On several occasions, the discipline of Moore&#x27;s army broke down; British troops sacked Benavente on 28 December and hundreds of drunken soldiers were abandoned on 2 January at Bembibre and were captured or killed by pursuing French dragoons. Paget attempted to hang three British soldiers for sacking a Spanish town but was forced to abandon the executions after pursuing French troops neared. The French cavalry General Colbert, was killed while in close pursuit across the bridge at the village of Cacabelos by a long-range rifle shot fired by Thomas Plunket of the 95th Rifles after driving off the British 15th Hussars. Losses were about the same for the two units.

Moore made a stand before the old Roman town of Lugo on 6 January and offered battle but, initially, Soult&#x27;s forces were too strung out. Over two days Soult concentrated his troops and tried to get Ney to send a division from Villa Franca del Bierzo but Ney sent few troops. By the 8th Soult was prepared for battle, but Moore, imagining Ney was outflanking him, slipped away that night, shooting 500 foundered horses and destroying artillery caissons and food stores. Now realizing he could not get to Vigo and fearing his army would disintegrate on the way, he ordered the transports to Betanzos Bay between Corunna and Ferrol and he headed for Corunna.

Rain storms and confusion caused the British main body to partially lose order and break up with thousands straggling. Some 500 British were captured by the pursuing French dragoons, with hundreds more stragglers captured by Franceschi&#x27;s cavalry on the 10th and several hundred more on the 11th. The loss of troops between Lugo and Betanzos was greater than all of that of the preceding retreat. Eventually, on 11 January, the British main body reached the port of Corunna in northwest Spain, where they had hoped to find the fleet to take them back to England. They found Betanzos Bay empty and only 26 transports and two warships at Corunna. The rest of the 245 ships had been delayed by contrary winds only arriving at Vigo on the 8th and would not depart for Corunna until the 13th.

The French had also suffered severe fatigue and deprivation during their pursuit having to travel over ground already crossed by the British. The British rearguard had held off the pursuing French, allowing the rest of the British army to continue to withdraw, however the French cavalry had continually pressed them and prevented effective reconnaissance by the British cavalry. Soult&#x27;s infantry had also had trouble keeping up and was badly strung out and most were well behind the cavalry which included the divisions of Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge and Jean Baptiste Marie Franceschi-Delonne. Soult&#x27;s three infantry divisions, commanded by Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle, Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet and Henri François Delaborde, and his artillery would arrive at Corunna piecemeal over the next few days.

The British army arrived in Corunna on 11 January and there were found only the ships of the line, a small number of transport and hospital ships to which the many wounded were embarked. There was also a large quantity of badly needed military stores: 5,000 new muskets were issued to the troops, a vast amount of cartridges for re-equipping, numerous Spanish artillery pieces and plenty of food, shoes and other supplies.

The French army began to arrive the next day, building up strength as they arrived from the march. Soult&#x27;s artillery arrived on 14 January. The long-awaited transport ships also arrived on the 14th and that evening the British evacuated their sick, some horses and most of the remaining field guns, cavalrymen and gunners. There was no intention by the British of garrisoning and holding on to Corunna as a future base with its extensive stores and certain support from the sea. The British then destroyed a portion of the enormous amount of military stores originally intended for the Spanish: nearly 12,000 barrels of powder, 300,000 cartridges in two magazines outside the town and 50 fortress guns and 20 mortars.

The British embarked nearly all their cannon and artillerists and, as the terrain was unsuitable for cavalry, all their cavalry troopers and a few healthy horses, but killed some 2,000 of the cavalry&#x27;s horses. Moore now actually had the advantage in numbers in infantry, 15,000 to 12,000 and, with the rough ground much broken up by sunken roads and walls, Soult&#x27;s cavalry would be of little use. The British were rearmed, well rested and well fed, in marked contrast to the oncoming French.

Moore had deployed his army to cover the evacuation by placing the main part of it on a ridge astride the road to Corunna, a mile and a half south of the harbour. A stronger position lay to the south but the British commander considered that he lacked the numbers to defend it properly and had to be content with placing outposts there to slow the approach of the French. The left flank was covered by the river Mero and the left and centre of the ridge was quite defensible. The western and lower end of this ridge was more vulnerable and could be swept by guns on the rocky heights of the loftier range opposite, and the ground further west consisted of more open terrain extending as far as Corunna which might provide the means of turning the whole position. Moore held two divisions back in reserve a little north and westwards in order to guard the right flank and to prevent a turning movement.

On 15 January French troops pushed back the British outposts on the higher range and gradually took up position there. A counterattack by British 5th Foot was repulsed with heavy loss. Soult sited his 11 heavy guns upon the rocky outcrop from where they would be able to fire upon the British right. The task was very difficult and it was night before the guns had been dragged into position. Delaborde&#x27;s division was posted on the right and Merle&#x27;s in the centre with Mermet on the left. The light field guns of the French were distributed across the front of their position, however the broken ground, sunken roads and walls limited them to long range support. The French cavalry was deployed to the east of the line. For the British, Baird&#x27;s division formed on the right and Hope&#x27;s the left, each deploying a brigade &quot;en potence&quot; with Paget as the reserve at the village Airis.

==Battle==
As day broke on 16 January the French were in position on the heights, and all through the morning both armies observed each across the valley between them. Moore planned to continue with the embarkation later that day if Soult did not attack. By afternoon Moore considered an attack unlikely and ordered the first divisions to make their way to the port; the rest of the army would follow at dusk, but shortly afterwards, at 2:00 pm, he learned that the French were attacking.

Soult&#x27;s plan was to move against the strongly placed British infantry of the left and centre in order to contain it while the infantry division of Mermet attacked the more vulnerable British right above the village of Elviña. The cavalry was deployed further west near the more open country leading to Corunna. If the attacks succeeded they could seize the western end of the British lines and push on to cut off the bulk of the army from Corunna.
Mermet&#x27;s infantry advanced quickly and soon pushed the British picquets back, carrying the town of Elviña and attacking the heights beyond. The first French column divided into two with Gaulois&#x27; and Jardon&#x27;s brigades attacking Baird front and flank, and the third French brigade pushing up the valley on the British right in an attempt to turn their flank with Lahoussaye&#x27;s dragoons moving with difficulty over the broken ground and walls trying to cover the left of the French advance.
The fiercest fighting took place in and around Elviña as the possession of this village would change hands several times, and the British suffered particularly from the fire of the heavy artillery on the heights opposite. As the French attack broke through Elviña and came up the hill behind it, Moore sent in the 50th Foot and the 42nd (Black Watch) to stop the French infantry while the 4th Foot held the right flank of the British line. The ground around the village was broken up by numerous stone walls and hollow roads. Moore remained in this area to direct the battle, ordering the 4th Foot to fire down upon the flank of the second French column that was attempting the turning movement and calling up the reserve under Paget to meet it. The British advance carried beyond the village but some confusion among the British allowed Mermet&#x27;s reserves to drive into and through Elviña again chasing the 50th and 42nd back up the slope. Moore called up his divisional reserve, some 800 men from two battalions of the Guards, and together with the 42nd they halted the French advance.
The British commander had just rallied the 42nd that had fallen back from Elviña and had ordered the Guards to advance on the village when he was struck by a cannonball. He fell mortally wounded, struck &quot;on the left shoulder, carrying it away with part of the collar-bone, and leaving the arm hanging only by the flesh and muscles above the armpit&quot;. He remained conscious, and composed, throughout the several hours of his dying. The second advance again drove the French back through Elviña. Mermet now threw in his last reserves with one of Merle&#x27;s brigade attacking the east side of the village. This was countered by an advance by Manningham&#x27;s brigade and a long fire-fight broke out between two British: the 3/1st and the 2/81st and two French regiments: the 2nd Légere and 36th Ligne of Reynaud&#x27;s brigade. The 81st was forced out of the fight and relieved by the 2/59th and the fighting petered out here late in the day with the French finally retiring.

For a time the British were without a leader until General John Hope took command as Baird was also seriously wounded. This hampered attempts at a counterattack in the crucial sector of Elviña, but the fighting continued unabated.

Further west the French cavalry pushed forward as part of the flank attack and made a few charges but they were impeded by the rough terrain. Lahoussaye dismounted some his Dragoons which fought as skirmishers but they were eventually driven back by the advance of the 95th Rifles, 28th Foot and 91st Foot of the British reserves. Franceschi&#x27;s cavalry moved to flank the extreme right of the British attempting to cut them off at the gates of Corunna but were countered again by the terrain and Fraser&#x27;s division drawn up on the Santa Margarita ridge which covered the neck of the peninsula and the gates. As Lahoussaye retired, Franceschi conformed with his movement.

Night brought an end to the fighting by which time the French attacks had been repulsed and they returned to their original positions; both sides holding much the same ground as before the fight.

==Aftermath==

===End of Corunna campaign===
Command of the British army had passed to General Hope who decided to continue the embarkation rather than to attempt to hold their ground or attack Soult. At around 9:00 pm the British began to silently withdraw from their lines, leaving behind strong picquets who maintained watch-fires throughout the night.

At daybreak on 17 January the picquets were withdrawn behind the rearguard and went aboard ship; by morning most of the army had embarked. When Soult perceived that the British had left the ridge, he posted six guns on the heights above the southern end of the bay and by midday the French were able to fire upon the outlying ships. This caused panic amongst some of the transports, four of which ran aground and were then burned to prevent their capture. Fire from the warships then silenced the battery.

On 18 January, the British rearguard embarked as the Spanish garrison under General Alcedo &quot;faithfully&quot; held the citadel until the fleet was well out to sea before surrendering. The city of Corunna was taken by the French, two Spanish regiments surrendering along with 500 horses and considerable military stores captured including numerous cannon, 20,000 muskets, hundreds of thousands of cartridges and tons of gunpowder. A week later Soult&#x27;s forces captured Ferrol, an even greater arsenal and a major Spanish naval base across the bay, taking eight ships of the line, three with 112 guns, two with 80, one 74, two 64s, three frigates and numerous corvettes, as well as a large arsenal with over 1,000 cannon, 20,000 new muskets from England and military stores of all kinds.

As a result of the battle the British suffered around 900 men dead or wounded. Unable to embark the many horses in the army, most of the nearly 2,000 cavalry horses and as many as 4,000 more horses of the artillery and train were slaughtered to prevent them from falling into French hands. The French lost around 1,000 men killed, wounded or captured. The most notable casualty was Lieutenant-General Moore, who survived long enough to learn of his success. Sir David Baird, Moore&#x27;s second in command, was seriously wounded earlier in the battle and had to retire from the field. In addition two of Mermet&#x27;s three brigadiers were also casualties: Gaulois was shot dead and Lefebvre badly hurt.

On the morning of the battle 4,035 British were listed sick, a few hundred of these were too sick to embark and were left behind. Two more transports were lost with about 300 troops mostly from the King&#x27;s German Legion. By the time the army returned to England four days later some 6,000 were ill, with the sick returns listed at Portsmouth and Plymouth alone as 5,000.

Within ten days the French had captured two fortresses containing an immense amount of military matériel which, with more resolution, could have been defended against the French for many months. Ney and his corps reinforced with two cavalry regiments took on the task of occupying Galicia. Soult was able to refit his corps, which had been on the march and fighting since 9 November, with the captured stores so that, with half a million cartridges and 3,000 artillery rounds carried on mules (the roads not being suitable for wheeled transport), and with his stragglers now closed up on the main body, he was able to begin his march on Portugal on 1 February with a strength of 19,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 58 guns.

==Analysis==
The British army had been sent into Spain to aid in expelling the French, but they had been forced into a humiliating retreat in terrible winter conditions that wrought havoc with health and morale and resulted in the army degenerating into a rabble. In his authoritative account of the battle, the English historian Christopher Hibbert states: &quot;It was all very well to talk of the courage and endurance of the troops but of what use were these virtues alone when pitted against the genius of Napoleon? 35,000 men had crossed the Spanish frontier against him; 8000 had not returned. We were unworthy of our great past.&quot; The British of the day similarly viewed Corunna as a defeat: according to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The fact must not be disguised... that we have suffered a shameful disaster.&quot;

The historian Charles Oman contends that Marshal Soult&#x27;s attack at Corunna provided Moore and his men with the opportunity to redeem their honour and reputation through their defensive victory, by which means the army was saved though at the cost of the British general&#x27;s life. This view was echoed by the Count of Toreno, a contemporary of Moore&#x27;s and author of the classic Spanish history of the war. Moore was buried wrapped in a military cloak in the ramparts of the town. The funeral is commemorated in a well-known poem by Charles Wolfe (1791–1823), &quot;The Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna&quot;.

Charles Esdaile, in &quot;The Peninsular War: A New History&quot;, writes: &quot;In military terms, Moore&#x27;s decision to retreat was therefore probably sensible enough but in other respects it was a disaster ... Having failed to appear in time ... then allowed Madrid to fall without a shot, the British now seemed to be abandoning Spain altogether.&quot; Also, &quot;Even worse than the physical losses suffered by the allies was the immense damage done to Anglo-Spanish relations. ... de la Romana ... openly accusing Moore of betrayal and bad faith.&quot; Finally, &quot;... the occupation (by the French) of the most heavily populated region in the whole of Spain&quot;.
Chandler states, the British Army had been &quot;... compelled to conduct a precipitate retreat and evacuate by sea.&quot; Also, &quot;Madrid and the Northern half of Spain were under occupation by French troops&quot;. Fremont-Barnes, in &quot;The Napoleonic Wars: The Peninsular War 1807–1814&quot;, writes that the then British Foreign Secretary Canning: &quot; ... privately condemned Moore&#x27;s failed campaign in increasingly stronger terms,&quot; while in public he &quot; ... in the great British tradition of characterizing defeat as victory, insisted that although Moore&#x27;s army had been pushed out of Spain his triumph at the battle of Corunna had left &#x27;fresh laurels blooming upon our brows&#x27;&quot;.

A more charitable view is offered by W. H. Fitchett in &quot;How England Saved Europe&quot;: &quot;... it is also a dramatic justification of Moore&#x27;s strategy that he had drawn a hostile force so formidable into a hilly corner of Spain, thus staying its southward rush&quot;. Napier similarly speculates: &quot;The second sweep that [Napoleon] was preparing to make when Sir John Moore&#x27;s march called off his attention from the south would undoubtedly have put him in possession of the remaining great cities of the Peninsula.&quot;

Nevertheless, back in England the reaction to news of the Battle of Corunna and the safe evacuation of the army was a storm of criticism over Moore&#x27;s handling of the campaign, while back in Corunna his adversary Marshal Soult took care of Moore&#x27;s grave and ordered a monument to be raised in his memory.

<text>In Swedish folklore, the Storsjöodjuret (, literally &quot;The Great-Lake Monster&quot;) is a lake monster said to live in the lake Storsjön in Jämtland in the middle of Sweden.

The lake monster is first attested in a 1635 manuscript, according to which the sea/lake serpent (&quot;sjöorm&quot;) was bound up magically in the lake&#x27;s depths by Kettil Runske who carved his spell into the Frösö Runestone (Frösö being an island in this lake). Later folk legends circulating locally in Jämtland claimed the monster was a product of tinkering by two trolls, and that it was a cat-headed creature with a black serpentine body.

There have been numerous eyewitness accounts since the 19th century, giving varying details, some claiming a dog-like head.

== Name ==
The monster is popularly referred to as Storsjöodjuret (the noun &quot;Storsjöodjur&quot; was first used in 1899) where &quot;odjur&quot; is a Swedish word for ‘monster’ or ‘large vermin’, literally ‘unanimal’. While Storsjö is the name of a lake (or lakes), &quot;storsjö&quot; can also be a common noun meaning ‘great-lake’, being the compound of Swedish &quot;stor&quot; (‘big’ or ‘great’) and &quot;sjö&quot; (‘lake’) .

Sometimes it is simply called Storsjödjuret (‘The great-lake animal’).

In the English language Storsjöodjuret is sometimes called Storsie, similarly to Nessie, though the names Storsjö Monster, Storsjoe Monster or &quot;the monster of Lake Storsjön&quot;, etc., and the literal translation The Great Lake Monster are used. Its Latin name is &quot;Hydogiganta Monstruidae Jemtlandicum&quot;. It has also been called Storsjöormen (‘The Great Lake Serpent’).

== Legends ==
;17th century attestations
The earliest description is of a sea/lake-serpent () inhabiting Storsjön, contained in a manuscript by Morten Pedersen Herdal dated to 1635. According to commentators this text ascribed to rune-master Kettil Runske the feat of binding this serpent to the bottom of the lake by carving a magic spell into the Frösö Runestone (erected on Frösö, an island in this lake).

A version of the legend was also recorded in the group of writings associated with the &quot;&quot; (‘Researches into Antiquities’), specifically in a piece dated 1685 by Anders Plantin (Andreas Plantinus):

&quot;It is said that beneath this [rune]stone lies a dreadfully large head of a serpent and that the body stretches over Storsjön to village and Hille Sand where the tail is buried. The serpent was called a rå and therefore shall this stone be raised. Since no one peacefully could cross [Storsjön], the ferryman and his wife states, along with many others, that in the last turbulent time this stone was torn down and broken in two. As long as this stone lay on the ground many strange things occurred in the water, until the stone was raised and assembled anew&quot;.
The Frösö stone has a large serpent depicted on it, but there is no reference to it nor to Kettil Runske in the text itself, which instead tells about Austmaðr, Guðfastr&#x27;s son&#x27;s christening of Jämtland, and the construction of the Frösö Bridge, though the stone has indeed been broken in two pieces.

;Folktale
The folk-legend that circulated around the Jämtland region provided additional details. According to this lore, &quot;A long, long time ago&quot;, two trolls named Jata and Kata were on Storsjön&#x27;s shore, each one brewing his cauldron at the lake for &quot;days, weeks and months&quot;, until at last was heard &quot;a groaning sound as if from a sick child&quot; followed by a &quot;loud bang.. as if by a violent thunderclap&quot;, and out of one cauldron leaped out a strange creature with a black serpent-like body and a cat-like head, which disappeared into the lake (the trolls and the cauldrons too vanished as well, in a wisp of white smoke, leaving a gaping abyss). The monster dwelling in the lake became a menace to surrounding areas, and grew so big as to encircle the entire island of Frösön and be able to bite its own tail. Then came along Ketil Jamte who bound the beast by carving spells into a stone which was erected on the east shore of Frösön. Parts of the beast were still visible above the water-line, but it is warned that it could be liberated some day when someone deciphers the runestone.

The name of the hero may be Ketil Jamte or Ketil Ruske depending on the version. According to one informant, the rune-master was named Gudfast, which thus makes connection with the legendary Austmann Gudfastsson (, aforementioned, inscribed on the runestone).

== Eyewitness accounts ==

There have been hundreds of recorded sightings of &quot;Storsjöodjuret&quot; dating back to the 19th century. Newspapers reported in July 1857 that workers at the Forssbacka bruk (iron mill) on the lake spotted from far away a creature with a head &quot;black and gleaming&quot;, about the size of a large cat&#x27;s head (), with the water movement suggesting it was a sort of sea-serpent.

Peter Olsson published an 1899 booklet, documenting 22 eyewitness testimonies, and collated the details in his summary. Olsson, a naturalist, concluded that the most likely match was some aquatic mammal that had yet to be identified.

The monster has been reported by various witnesses to measure on the order of in length, the length in Olsson&#x27;s accounts ranging from 3.5 to 14 meters (converted from the Swedish &quot;fot&quot;, foot or &quot;aln&quot;, cubit).

It had a snake-like body, long neck, with some giving the description of a dog-like head, thus making it an eared creature, unlike most serpents, though some accounts describing as finned is ambiguous as to fins or ears. Some said it had several humps () on its back, but Olsson lumped these cases together with &quot;vertical&quot; curvings or undulations ().

=== Capture campaign ===
Common interest in the creature was sparked first in the 1890s. After several sightings, an enterprise of locals was founded to catch the monster in 1894, even obtaining the sponsorship of King Oscar II. The failed attempt was featured in a satirical cartoon by Albert Engström in the magazine.

=== Film footage ===

In August 2008, a film crew claimed to have captured Storsjöodjuret on film, reporting that infrared cameras showed an endothermic mass in the lake.

=== Protected status ===
The only city located by Storsjön, Östersund, celebrated its 200-year anniversary in 1986. That year, the Jämtland county administrative board declared Storsjöodjuret to be an endangered species, and Storsjöodjuret along with its offspring and nest became protected by law. The law was revoked in 2005, with the Parliamentary Ombudsman (JO/&quot;Justitieombudsmannen&quot;) spearheading the criticism.

Its products included residential and business telephone terminals, screen telephones, Enterprise private branch exchanges (PBX), network access terminals and high-quality digital video encoders, decoders and gateways. Residential telephone equipment was sold in the United States as Bell equipment by Sonecor brand, which represented Southern New England Telecommunications.

Mitel Networks Corporation announced on November 11, 2013, that it would acquire Aastra Technologies Ltd. in a stock and cash deal valued at about $400 million.

== History ==
In 1983, Francis Shen and Hugh Scholaert bought an engineering consulting company, founding Aastra in Toronto in 1983. The company provided services to the defense industry. In 1993, the company started to specialise in telecommunications. Aastra went public in Canada in 1996.

In 2000, Aastra acquired the assets of Nortel Networks Access Solutions Division including the rights to manufacture phones under the Nortel name. Then, in 2001, Aastra acquired Lucent Technologies&#x27; Digital Video business and Ericsson Cable Modem. Aastra acquired Nortel CVX &amp; CSG Division in 2002 and the ASCOM PBX System Division in 2003.

In 2005, 75% of Aastra Technologies&#x27; sales were made in Europe, following the purchase that year of the Germany-based the EADS Enterprise Telephony Business and the DeTeWe Telecommunication Systems business. Its other sales shares that year included 17% in the United States, and only 5% in Canada.

In 2008, Aastra acquired the enterprise PBX division of Ericsson, best known for MD110/MX-ONE Telephony Switch.

In January 2014, Mitel completed its acquisition of Aastra, which has been announced in November 2013. Mitel lists the fate of former Aastra products on its website.

<text>163 (one hundred [and] sixty-three) is the natural number following 162 and preceding 164.

==In mathematics==
163 is the 38th prime number and a strong prime in the sense that it is greater than the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring primes.

163 is a lucky prime and a fortunate number.

163 is a strictly non-palindromic number, since it is not palindromic in any base between base 2 and base 161.

Given 163, the Mertens function returns 0, it is the fourth prime with this property, the first three such primes are 2, 101 and 149.

As approximations, formula_1, and formula_2

163 is a permutable prime in base 12, which it is written as 117, the permutations of its digits are 171 and 711, the two numbers in base 12 are 229 and 1021 in base 10, both of which are prime.

The function formula_3 gives prime values for all values of formula_4 between 0 and 39, while for formula_5 approximately half of all values are prime. 163 appears as a result of solving formula_6, which gives formula_7.

163 is a Heegner number, the largest of the nine such numbers. That is, the ring of integers of the field formula_8 has unique factorization for formula_9. The only other such integers are
formula_10. 

163 is the number of linearly -independent McKay-Thompson series for the monster group, which also represent their collective maximum dimensional representation. This fact about 163 might be a clue for understanding monstrous moonshine.

formula_11
appears in the Ramanujan constant, since -163 is a quadratic nonresidue to modulo all the primes 3, 5, 7, ..., 37. In which formula_12 almost equals the integer 262537412640768744 = 6403203 + 744. Martin Gardner famously asserted that this identity was exact in a 1975 April Fools&#x27; hoax in &quot;Scientific American&quot;; in fact the value is 262537412640768743.99999999999925007259...

It also satisfies formula_13.

163 is also:
* The number of days following the first day of Passover (Pesach), used to calculate the date of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

<doc id="867616" wikidata="Q508387" url="?curid=867616" title="Battle of Sacile">
<text>The Battle of Sacile (also known as the Battle of Fontana Fredda) on 16 April 1809 and its companion Clash at Pordenone on 15 April saw an Austrian army commanded by Archduke John of Austria defeat a Franco-Italian army led by Eugène de Beauharnais and force it to retreat. Sacile proved to be the most notable victory of John&#x27;s career. The action took place east of the Livenza River near Sacile in modern-day Italy during the War of the Fifth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars.

In April 1809, Archduke John quickly invaded Venetia in northeastern Italy. On 15 April at Pordenone, the Austrian advance guard routed the French rear guard, inflicting heavy losses. Undeterred by this setback and believing he enjoyed a numerical superiority over his opponents, Eugène attacked the Austrians east of Sacile the following day. Though the two sides were equal in numbers of foot soldiers, the Austrians possessed a two-to-one advantage in cavalry, and this turned out to be a key factor in their victory.

Eugène withdrew his army to a defensible position at Verona on the Adige river, where he reorganized his army and received reinforcements. At Verona, the Franco-Italian army was secure from Archduke John&#x27;s army advancing from the east and a second Austrian column threatening it from the Tyrol in the north. By the end of April, news of French victories in the Danube valley caused John to fall back to the east, with Eugène in pursuit.

==Background==

===Austrian strategy===
In the early part of 1809, the Austrian Empire of Emperor Francis II determined to go to war against Emperor Napoleon I&#x27;s First French Empire. Austria massed her main army in the Danube valley under Generalissimo Archduke Charles. Though Italy was considered a minor theater, Charles and the Hofkriegsrat (Austrian high command) assigned two corps to the Army of Inner Austria and placed General der Kavallerie Archduke John in command.
Regarded as &quot;incompetent&quot; by historian David G. Chandler, Archduke John had seen his first army utterly smashed by French General of Division Jean Moreau at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800. In Moreau&#x27;s subsequent pursuit, John&#x27;s army became so demoralized that it was scarcely able to defend itself and suffered huge losses in prisoners and weapons. During the War of the Third Coalition, he had done better. After Napoleon wiped out Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Mack von Leiberich&#x27;s Austrian army in the 1805 Ulm Campaign, John&#x27;s army beat a hasty retreat eastward from its position in the mountainous Vorarlberg. He successfully linked up with the Army of Italy, led by his brother, Archduke Charles. Unfortunately for Austria, Napoleon&#x27;s crushing victory at the Battle of Austerlitz ended the war before Charles and John could intervene in the Danube valley.

At the beginning of the 1809 war, John controlled Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles&#x27;s VIII Armeekorps of 24,500 infantry and 2,600 cavalry, and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Ignaz Gyulai&#x27;s IX Armeekorps of 22,200 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. The VIII Armeekorps assembled at Villach in Carinthia, while the IX Armeekorps massed to the south at Ljubljana (Laibach) in Carniola (now Slovenia). General-major Andreas Stoichevich with 10,000 troops faced General of Division Auguste Marmont&#x27;s XI Corps in Dalmatia, a French possession since 1806. A body of 26,000 Landwehr stood ready to man garrisons and defend the Austrian heartland. John planned to have the VIII Armeekorps move southwest from Villach and the IX Armeekorps advance northwest from Ljubljana. The two forces would unite near Cividale del Friuli.

Another source gave a somewhat different Austrian organization at the outbreak of war. Chasteler&#x27;s VIII Armeekorps possessed 20,100 men and 62 guns in two divisions. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Albert Gyulay led the 1st Division while Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann Maria Philipp Frimont commanded the 2nd Division. Ignaz Gyulai
&#x27;s IX Armeekorps counted 22,290 soldiers and 86 guns in three divisions. The 1st Division was led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Gorup von Besanez, the 2nd Division was under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Christian Wolfskehl von Reichenberg, and the 3rd Division was directed by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Vinko Knežević. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Guido Lippa was responsible for 30,000 Landwehr and reserves. These numbers differ somewhat from Schneid&#x27;s list and include Stoichevich&#x27;s force as part of Knesevich&#x27;s division.

Before the Austrians launched the war, the Tyrol flared in a spontaneous revolt. The German-speaking Tyrolese under leaders like Andreas Hofer began driving out the Bavarian garrisons. Desiring to aid the rebellion, Charles ordered John to send Chasteler and 10,000 Austrian troops to help the Tyrolese. Ignaz Gyulai&#x27;s brother Albert replaced Chasteler as the commander of a reduced VIII Armeekorps. The organization of Chastler&#x27;s force is shown in the Tyrol 1809 order of battle.

===French strategy===
Aware that Austria probably intended to make war, Napoleon reinforced the Army of Italy under Eugène de Beauharnais, building the French component up to a strength of six infantry and three cavalry divisions. Many of these &quot;French&quot; troops were Italians, since portions of northwest Italy had been annexed to France. In addition, Viceroy Eugène formed three Italian infantry divisions. The Franco-Italian army counted 70,000 troops, though they were somewhat scattered across northern Italy.

Before 1809, Eugène never led so much as a regiment into battle, yet Napoleon entrusted him with command of the Army of Italy. To prepare his stepson Eugène for the role, the emperor advised him how to defend Italy in many detailed letters. He wrote that if the Austrians invaded in superior numbers, the viceroy was to give up the Isonzo River line and fall back to the Piave River. The emperor noted that the Adige river was a particularly important strategic position. Napoleon did not believe Austria would attack in April, and in any case, did not wish to provoke his enemy by concentrating his armies. Therefore, Eugène&#x27;s army remained somewhat dispersed.

At the beginning of hostilities, the Franco-Italian troops were stationed in the following positions. The 1st Division of General of Division Jean Mathieu Seras and the 2nd Division under General of Division Jean-Baptiste Broussier deployed behind the Isonzo River. General of Division Paul Grenier&#x27;s 3rd Division and General of Division Jean Maximilien Lamarque&#x27;s 5th Division assembled behind the Tagliamento river. The 4th Division of General of Division Gabriel Barbou des Courières and the 6th Division under General of Division Pierre François Joseph Durutte concentrated in north-central Italy. The three cavalry divisions and the Italian Guard organized behind the Adige river. The unit locations are listed exactly as they are mentioned in the text. However, it is more likely that Barbou was behind the Tagliamento and Lamarque in north-central Italy. Otherwise, there is no explanation why Lamarque was unable to reach the field of battle.

===Operations===
Archduke John&#x27;s army invaded Italy on 10 April 1809, with the VIII Armeekorps advancing through Tarvisio and IX Armeekorps crossing the middle Isonzo. After unusually rapid marching for an Austrian army, Albert Gyulay&#x27;s column captured Udine on 12 April, with Ignaz Gyulai&#x27;s forces not far behind. Planning on concentrating his army behind the Tagliamento river, Eugène directed Seras and Broussier to slow down the Austrians. But the two divisions were unable to halt John&#x27;s advance. Even so, Eugène believed his army was strong enough to beat the archduke in battle, so he ordered his divisions to assemble at Sacile on the Livenza River. Because of the Tyrolese revolt, the viceroy sent General of Division Achille Fontanelli&#x27;s Italian division to Trento on the upper Adige with General of Division Louis Baraguey d&#x27;Hilliers in overall command.

By 14 April, Eugène massed six divisions near Sacile with Lamarque&#x27;s infantry and General of Division Charles Randon de Pully&#x27;s dragoons still distant. At this time, the Italian Guard, Durutte&#x27;s infantry, and General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy&#x27;s dragoons were still assembling on the Adige. Before the war, Eugène proposed to Napoleon that his infantry be formed into three corps, but the emperor had not replied to this request. Because of this, Eugène army fought the coming battle as a collection of divisions, which had a detrimental effect on command control. Meanwhile, John used small forces to mask the fortresses of Osoppo on the upper Tagliamento and Palmanova south of Udine. The Austrians reached Valvasone on the evening of 14 April, but John ordered a night march. Frimont&#x27;s advance guard was in the lead, with VIII Armeekorps right behind. Slowed by the rainy weather, the IX Armeekorps lagged behind.

==Battle==
&quot;The units and organizations of both armies are shown in the Sacile 1809 order of battle.&quot;

===Pordenone===
On 15 April, Eugène ordered his army forward across the Livenza. The French divisions of Grenier and Barbou moved through Sacile, while Seras&#x27; French and General of Division Filippo Severoli&#x27;s Italian division crossed at Brugnera and moved toward the village of Tamai. Broussier&#x27;s division crossed the Livenza to the north of Sacile. Meanwhile, General of Division Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc&#x27;s rear guard consisting of light cavalry and the 35th Line Infantry Regiment deployed 12 km to the east of Sacile near Pordenone. Sahuc&#x27;s patrols brought word that Archduke John&#x27;s troops were across the Tagliamento, but because Seras and Broussier had not kept a close watch on the advancing Austrians during their withdrawal, Eugène was unsure of his enemy&#x27;s strength.

Thanks to his scouts, Archduke John had a clear picture of his opponent&#x27;s army. He ordered Frimont&#x27;s advance guard to attack the French soldiers at Pordenone in the morning. At 6:00 am, the Austrians clashed with Sahuc&#x27;s cavalry patrols. General-major Joseph von Wetzel&#x27;s Grenz brigade attacked across the Noncello (Foncello) stream on the east side of the town, attracting the attention of the defending infantry. When General-major Josef von Schmidt&#x27;s line brigade came down from the northeast, the French were compelled to stretch the 35th Line to cover the north side of town. Sahuc formed his horsemen north of the town, hoping to catch the Austrian attackers in the flank. But it was the French cavalry who were flanked when Frimont fell on them with four regiments of cavalry, routing them. Without cavalry support, the infantry in the town were forced to pull out. Based on this source, Wetzel probably led the &quot;1st Banal&quot; Grenz. That leaves Schmidt to command the two line infantry battalions.

At Pordenone, the Austrians lost 221 killed and wounded plus 32 captured out of a total of 5,900 men and 15 guns. French losses were much heavier, 500 killed and wounded, plus 2,000 men and 4 guns captured out of 4,800 troops and 6 guns engaged. Many infantrymen of the 35th Line surrendered and the regiment lost an eagle and two colors. Historian Digby Smith wrote that the 35th was &quot;practically destroyed&quot;. In addition to the three battalions of the 35th Line, the 6th Hussar and the 6th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments were engaged on the French side. The Austrians committed one battalion of the &quot;Archduke Franz Karl&quot; IR Nr. 52, one battalion of the &quot;Franz Jellacic&quot; IR Nr. 62, and two battalions of the &quot;1st Banal&quot; Grenz IR Nr. 10 to action. Six squadrons of the &quot;Ott&quot; Hussar Regiment Nr. 5, four squadrons of the &quot;Frimont&quot; Hussar Regiment Nr. 9, and two squadrons of the &quot;Hohenzollern&quot; Chevau-léger Regiment Nr. 2 were also involved. Smith said the French 8th Hussars were engaged, but this is obviously an error and he meant the 6th Hussars.

===Sacile===
Aware of the French buildup at Tamai to the southeast of his positions, Archduke John posted Albert Gyulai&#x27;s VIII Armeekorps and Frimont&#x27;s Advance Guard to defend Pordenone and Porcia. Ignaz Gyulai&#x27;s IX Armeekorps, which had arrived late in the day of the 15th, bivouacked just west of Pordenone. While his left flank held off the expected Franco-Italian attacks on Porcia, John planned to send Ignaz Gyulai first to Roveredo in Piano then southwest in a lunge at Fontanafredda and Ranzano.

Still unaware of the presence of the IX Armeekorps, Eugène believed he faced only 20,000 Austrians. He boasted, &quot;In one day I will retake all of the territory I have abandoned at the moment.&quot; He knew that the Austrian cavalry enjoyed a numerical superiority over his own horsemen. Since the terrain on the Austrian left flank was unsuitable for mounted action, he determined to move against it. He appointed Seras to command both his own and Severoli&#x27;s divisions in the attack. Eugène ordered Barbou&#x27;s division to cooperate in the assault while Grenier pushed forward near Fontanafredda. Broussier held the left flank with Sahuc&#x27;s troopers between him and Grenier. A four-battalion task force watched for an envelopment on the far left flank.

Covered by an artillery barrage, Seras moved out at 9:00 am with his two divisions. They quickly seized Palse and began assaulting Porcia. Frimont unleashed the &quot;Ott&quot; Hussars, forcing Seras to pause in his advance. This bought time for John to send VIII Armeekorps in a counterattack against the Franco-Italians in which Severoli was wounded and his division nearly broken. At this moment, Barbou joined the battle and his division first checked the Austrians, then drove Frimont&#x27;s troops out of Porcia. Seeing his attack having trouble overcoming the Austrian left flank, Eugène ordered Grenier to leave Fontanafredda and throw his division into the battle on the right flank. Sahuc and Broussier shifted to the right to fill the gap in the Franco-Italian center.

Meanwhile, Ignaz Gyulai began his maneuver, leaving General-major Johann Kleinmayer&#x27;s grenadier reserve to help defend the left flank. Reaching Roveredo around noon, he veered to the southwest, launching three infantry brigades at Eugène&#x27;s thinned-out center about 1:30 pm. With General-major Anton Gajoli&#x27;s brigade holding Grenier&#x27;s division near Ronche, the IX Armeekorps threatened to overwhelm Broussier. Grenier rapidly disengaged most of his troops and sent them back to defend Fontanafredda, while Broussier counterattacked near Vignovo. In the center, there was bitter fighting near Ronche as the French repelled one attack only to have the Austrians mount a second one. Eugène refused to commit Sahuc&#x27;s cavalry in the face of the Austrian superiority in cavalry. During this crisis, Seras lost Porcia to an Austrian attack.

Seeing that his main attack failed, Eugène ordered a withdrawal at 5:00 pm. On the right flank, Severoli and Barbou&#x27;s troops covered the withdrawal. Historian Frederick C. Schneid believed that a mass cavalry attack &quot;could have smashed&quot; Grenier and Broussier, but Ignaz Gyulai kept Wolfskehl&#x27;s cavalry behind his infantry. Instead, Sahuc&#x27;s threatened attack pinned the IX Armeekorps long enough for Broussier and Grenier to get away. The two divisions retreated in square, each division lending support to the other. They finally reached the Livenza after numerous clashes with their Austrian pursuers. Nightfall allowed the two divisions to safely cross to the west side of the river. Seras, Barbou, and Severoli crossed the Livenza at Brugnera the following morning.

==Result==
The Franco-Italian army suffered 3,000 killed and wounded at Sacile. An additional 3,500 soldiers, 19 guns, 23 ammunition wagons, and two colors fell into the hands of the Austrians. Pagès was wounded and captured while Teste was wounded. According to Smith, the Austrians lost 2,617 killed and wounded, 532 captured, and 697 missing. Schneid listed Austrian losses as 3,600 killed and wounded and 500 captured.
Archduke John decided not to follow up his victory, since the VIII Armeekorps was mauled in the fighting near Porcia and the IX Armeekorps cavalry was worn out. Instead, Frimont trailed after the Army of Italy with his advance guard. Schneid wrote, &quot;John&#x27;s failure to pursue one week after Sacile was one of his greatest blunders&quot;.

On the evening of the battle, Lamarque and Pully reached Conegliano after being delayed by wet weather and bad roads. Eugène used the two divisions as a rear guard as his defeated troops straggled back to the Piave. He also sent Barbou and ten battalions to reinforce Venice, forcing John to detach a force to mask the Adriatic Sea port. The Franco-Italian army held the line of the Piave for four days, but fell back toward the Brenta River on 21 April. When the Army of Inner Austria arrived near Verona on 28 April, it found Eugène in a strong defensive position behind the Adige. Meanwhile, Chasteler captured Innsbruck on 12 April and Trento on the upper Adige on 23 April. The Tyrol detachment advanced as far as Roveredo on 26 April before being halted by Baraguey d&#x27;Hilliers.

Napoleon was enraged at his stepson&#x27;s fumbling and he proposed to replace him with Marshal Joachim Murat who was King of Naples at the time. Nothing came of this threat because by the time his letter arrived, Eugène was advancing again. The viceroy had accumulated reinforcements as he retreated, so that his army numbered 60,000 by the time it reached the Adige. Meanwhile, John&#x27;s army shrank as it detached a force to observe Venice and a brigade to reinforce Chasteler. News of Napoleon&#x27;s victory over Archduke Charles at the Battle of Eckmühl on 22 April caused Archduke John to fall back toward Austria at the beginning of May. The next engagements between John and Eugène were the Battle of Caldiero in the last days of April and the Battle of Piave River on 8 May.

<text>In the United Kingdom a hybrid bill (which becomes a hybrid instrument or hybrid act) is a government measure which affects a particular individual or organisation in a different manner to other individuals or companies in the same class; it thus bears some resemblance to a private bill. No definitive rules dictate whether a bill is hybrid in substance; the decision is entrusted via the Speaker, to one or more House of Commons officials designated as the &#x27;Examiners of petitions for Private Bills&#x27;. It is thus possible that a government unexpectedly finds itself promoting a private measure, upsetting its planned legislative timetable.

The government tends to initiate these on behalf of other bodies and authorities. The default procedure is they are treated like a private bill for the beginning of passage through the Parliament, laid before select committees of both houses empowered to hear petitions from individuals or bodies opposing it. Nevertheless a government can dispense with this additional procedure if it can muster a Commons majority to do so. The bill is then treated as a public bill. It thus proceeds to possible amendment before a select committee in either or in both Houses.

Examples have been those to construct the Channel Tunnel, the Dartford Crossing, Crossrail and High Speed 2.

Acts that were deemed to be hybrid bills include:
* Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977
* Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996
* Crossrail Act 2008
* High Speed Rail (London–West Midlands) Act 2017
* High Speed Rail (West Midlands-Crewe) Act 2021

Their use originated as part of British parliamentary procedure, but the procedure is also occasionally used by other parliaments and assemblies set up on a similar vein to Westminster.

Hybrid instruments have found an ideal purpose in legislating on behalf of railway companies and transport agencies to obtain authorisation for major projects voted to be in the national interest and which would affect many private interests significantly.

Statutory instruments can be hybrids. When opposed, such instruments are referred to the Hybrid Instruments Committee to report to the House on whether a select committee should be appointed to consider the petition or petitions against the instrument.

In Canada, they are specifically disallowed by Beauchesne&#x27;s &quot;Rules and Forms of the House of Commons of Canada&quot;, which states that &quot;According to Canadian standing orders and practice, there are only two kinds of bills – public and private. The British hybrid bill is not recognized in Canadian practice.&quot;

<doc id="867624" wikidata="Q6979083" url="?curid=867624" title="1866 National Union Convention">
<text>The National Union Convention (also known as the Loyalist Convention, the Southern Loyalist Convention, the National Loyalists&#x27; Loyal Union Convention, or the Arm-In-Arm Convention) was held on August 14–16, 1866, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Convention==
The convention was called in Philadelphia before the midterm elections of 1866, in an attempt to encourage political support for US President Andrew Johnson, who was under attack by both moderate and Radical Republicans. Johnson&#x27;s friends tried to rally support for his lenient pro-South Reconstruction policies. Some hoped to create a new political party, but that goal was not realized. For their part, Republican-aligned newspapers called it the &quot;Rebel–Johnson convention&quot;, insinuating Johnson&#x27;s true loyalty was to the Confederacy.

Delegates gathered at a hastily built temporary structure that was designed to accommodate the several thousand people expected to attend. Formally called &quot;the Wigwam,&quot; the immense edifice was on Girard Avenue, between 19th and 20th Streets, across from Philadelphia&#x27;s Girard College.

The convention voted on a resolution supporting black suffrage. Governor Arthur I. Boreman argued against it as &quot;we did not come here to commit suicide&quot; and that passing the resolution would have them &quot;damned to all eternity&quot;. Frederick Douglass, attending the convention despite pleas from Oliver P. Morton, was one of two black delegates to the convention and argued for passing the resolution.

About 7000 prominent politicians and activists attended the convention. At its opening, representatives from Massachusetts (General Darius Nash Couch) and South Carolina (Governor James Lawrence Orr) paraded arm-in-arm to symbolize national reconciliation and social equity. The convention was called to order by US Postmaster General Alexander Randall. General (and former New York Governor and Senator) John Adams Dix served as the temporary chairman and Wisconsin Senator James R. Doolittle served as permanent convention president.

In the end, the convention was not successful in unifying the country behind Johnson. He launched a speaking tour (known as the &quot;Swing Around the Circle&quot;) hoping to regain public and political support. On the speaking tour, Johnson at times attacked his Republican opponents with crude and abusive language and on several occasions appeared to have had too much to drink. Ultimately, the tour was a disaster for Johnson and emboldened Congress to override him and to impeach him in 1868.

<text>Eileen Fulton (born Margaret Elizabeth McLarty; September 13, 1933) is an American actress, singer, and author. She is known for her television role as Lisa Grimaldi on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, which she played almost continuously for 50 years, from May 18, 1960, until the show&#x27;s ending on September 17, 2010. She also starred on &quot;Our Private World&quot; (1965), a primetime spin off of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. For her work on &quot;ATWT&quot;, she received an Editor&#x27;s Award at the Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1991 and a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004. Fulton has appeared in theatrical productions, including the original Broadway run of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; She has performed a cabaret act at theaters in New York and Los Angeles. She has co-authored two autobiographies, &quot;How My World Turns&quot; and &quot;As My World Still Turns.&quot; She has also written a novel titled &quot;Soap Opera,&quot; and six murder mystery novels.

== Early life ==
Fulton was born Margaret Elizabeth McLarty in Asheville, North Carolina on September 13, 1933. Her father was a Methodist minister and she is descended from a long line of clergymen. When she was two years old, Fulton interrupted church services by performing the song &quot;Shortnin&#x27; Bread.&quot;

Her father&#x27;s work as a minister caused the family to move frequently. They lived in Mount Holly, Winston-Salem, Boone, Belmont and Marion. When she was in the third grade, Fulton told her parents, &quot;When I grow up and become a movie star, I&#x27;m going to get you a house of your own.&quot;

She attended Greensboro College, studying music and dramatics. During her college years, she performed in &quot;Candide&quot;. Fulton also played an elf in a production of James Thurber&#x27;s &quot;The 13 Clocks&quot;. She majored in music. After graduation, her father found her a job working with a local church choir, but she wanted to move to New York.

==Career==

=== 1956-1960: &quot;As the World Turns&quot; ===
Fulton made her professional acting debut in the play &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; in Manteo, North Carolina. She moved to New York in 1956 and attended the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. She studied with Sanford Meisner and Lee Strasberg. She supported herself with a variety of jobs, including selling hats at Macy&#x27;s and modeling. She posed for photos that were used on the cover of True Confessions magazine. She started using the stage name of Eileen Fulton. She was cast as Lisa Mae Bailey in the drama film &quot;Girl of the Night&quot; (1960), co-starring with Anne Francis.

She was cast as Lisa Grimaldi (then known as Lisa Miller) on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, first airing May 18, 1960. Fulton originated the role. In her early years on the show, the character of Lisa was married to Dr. Bob Hughes (Don Hastings). That romance eventually failed, but she went on to have seven more marriages.

In the 1960s, Fulton became the first soap actress to hire a publicist. The character of Lisa became hated after a sequence where she hired a maid to clean the house and went gallivanting about town. When mother-in-law Nancy complimented Lisa on what a nice home she made for her son Bob, the audience became furious, stopping Fulton on the street and slapping her.

She once refused to film a scene where the character of Lisa was being spanked, because she believed it glorified spousal abuse. Another time, when the show&#x27;s producer and head writer, Irna Phillips, refused to tell her if Lisa was the culprit during a murder mystery, Fulton told her, &quot;We&#x27;re live–don’t forget. And if you don’t tell me, I&#x27;ll make up your mind for you on the air.&quot;

=== 1960-1966: &quot;Our Private World&quot; ===
In the 1960s, she also took theater roles. She appeared in &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; with Hal Holbrook. Fulton replaced Melinda Dillon as Honey in the original Broadway production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; She also starred Off-Broadway in &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;. Fulton would perform in the live broadcast of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, then be on stage for the matinee performance of &quot;Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; There was only a 30-minute window between the time &quot;ATWT&quot; concluded its live broadcast at 2:00 pm, and the beginning of the first act of &quot;Virginia Woolf.&quot; She had time to travel from CBS&#x27; studios to the Billy Rose Theatre and get into costume because her character did not appear on stage for the first 20 minutes. Fulton would be back onstage by evening, performing in &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;.

Her other theater credits include &quot;Many Loves&quot;, &quot;Any Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Sabrina Fair&quot;, &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot;, &quot;Nite Club Confidential&quot;, &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, &quot;It Had To be You&quot;, &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot; and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;.

Fulton left &quot;As the World Turns&quot; for several months in 1964. During her absence, the role of Lisa was recast with actress Pamela King. In 1965, Irna Phillips, the head writer of &quot;ATWT&quot;, created a primetime spin-off series, &quot;Our Private World,&quot; focused on the character of Lisa. The spin-off lasted from May 5 to September 10, 1965, before being cancelled. Fulton took several months off before returning to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in May 1966. CBS hired a bodyguard to escort her to and from the studio due to overzealous fans.

=== 1966-1986: The Granny clause ===
In the late 1960s, after her onscreen son was aged from age 12 to 19, Fulton insisted it be written into her contract that her character could not become a grandmother. She feared that the perception of her as a grandmother, instead of a glamorous and vital woman, would cause the writers to kill off her character. (This had been done when Barbara Berjer, who was playing one of Lisa&#x27;s rivals, Claire Shea, became a grandmother).

In 1970, Fulton co-authored her first autobiography, &quot;How My World Turns&quot;. She also released her debut album, &quot;The Same Old World&quot;, on the Pan label. She was briefly absent from &quot;ATWT&quot; in the late 1970s and the role of Lisa was recast with actress Lynn Rogers.

She left &quot;ATWT&quot; again in April 1983 and the role was recast with Betsy von Furstenberg. Fulton returned eighteen months later, first airing on August 3, 1984. She agreed to return when she was promised to have six months on the show, followed by six months off, a more glamorous storyline and time off for singing and acting appearances. Fans, believing that the &quot;granny clause&quot; as it had become known, was still in effect (which it was not), sent Fulton so much threatening &quot;hate mail&quot; when Lisa&#x27;s onscreen daughter-in-law, Margo, had a miscarriage in 1986, that she again had to have a bodyguard.

=== 1988-1998: Books ===
In the late 1980s, she wrote a series of six murder mystery novels: &quot;Take One for Murder&quot;, &quot;Death of a Golden Girl&quot;, &quot;Dying for Stardom&quot;, &quot;Lights, Camera, Death&quot;, &quot;A Setting for Murder&quot;, and &quot;Fatal Flashback&quot;.

Fulton was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 1988. In June 1990, she took a leave of absence from &quot;ATWT&quot; while she underwent gynecological surgery. The role of Lisa was temporarily recast with Jane Powell. In 1991, Fulton received the Editor&#x27;s Award at the Soap Opera Digest Awards. She took another short break from &quot;ATWT&quot; in 1992 and was replaced with Maeve McGuire. Jane Powell filled in for Fulton again briefly in 1993 and 1994.

In 1995, she co-authored her second autobiography, &quot;As My World Still Turns,&quot; to celebrate her 35th anniversary on &quot;ATWT.&quot; Fulton was nominated for a Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1996. She was inducted into the Soap Opera Hall of Fame in 1998.

=== 1999-present ===
Fulton wrote a fiction novel titled &quot;Soap Opera,&quot; loosely based on her experiences on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. In the early 2000s, she routinely performed a cabaret act at the West Bank Cafe in Manhattan. She also brought the act to the Cinegrill in Los Angeles. The spotlight song of Fulton&#x27;s cabaret performances was &quot;As If We Never Said Goodbye,&quot; from &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. She would perform the song in front a slideshow tribute to her years on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. She headlined CabaretFest 2003 in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

On June 1, 2000, &quot;ATWT&quot; aired a special clip montage to honor Fulton and her co-star Don Hastings&#x27; 40th anniversaries on the show. In 2004, they both received Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Awards. She was absent from &quot;ATWT&quot; for a few days in 2004 and the role of Lisa was temporarily recast with Carmen Duncan. Fulton played Betty in the drama film &quot;The Signs of the Cross&quot; (2005), co-starring with Dan Lauria. She played Joyce Singleton in the drama film &quot;Tinsel Town&quot; (2005), written and directed by Kenneth del Vecchio. She also appeared as Mrs. Carreck in &quot;The Drum Beats Twice&quot; (2008), another film written and directed by del Vecchio.

The cancellation of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was announced in December 2009. In May 2010, &quot;ATWT&quot; aired a tribute episode, celebrating Fulton&#x27;s 50th year on the show. In the episode, the show&#x27;s younger cast members re-enacted classic scenes of Lisa and Nancy (Helen Wagner). Fulton remained on the show through its cancellation, but she only appeared briefly in the final episode, airing September 17, 2010.

In 2010, Fulton performed her cabaret act at Don&#x27;t Tell Mama in New York. In April 2011, she brought her act, titled &quot;Blame It on My Youth,&quot; to the New Hope Cabaret in Pennsylvania. In July 2011, she played Mrs. Higgins in a Connecticut Repertory Theatre production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, co-starring with Terrence Mann.

==Personal life==
In honor of her father, Fulton established a music scholarship at Brevard College in North Carolina. She also established a Fine Arts Scholarship in her and her mother&#x27;s name at their alma mater, Greensboro College. She was awarded an honorary doctorate at Greensboro College when she spoke at their commencement.

Fulton was an investor in the New York Stars women&#x27;s basketball team.

She married her first husband, Bill Cochrane, in 1957 and they later divorced.

She married her second husband, record producer Danny Fortunato, in 1970. They divorced in 1980. Fulton has said that she wore disguises when going to work after their breakup, because she was afraid of him.

Fulton met landscape architect Rick McMorrow at a political benefit. They were married in 1989 and divorced three months later. She has said that the marriage was over the day after their wedding.

<doc id="867630" wikidata="Q479979" url="?curid=867630" title="Battle of Abensberg">
<text>The Battle of Abensberg took place on 20 April 1809 between a Franco-German force under the command of Emperor Napoleon I of France and a reinforced Austrian corps led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke Louis of Austria. As the day wore on, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von Hiller arrived with reinforcements to take command of the three corps that formed the Austrian left wing. The action ended in a complete Franco-German victory. The battlefield was southeast of Abensberg and included clashes at Offenstetten, Biburg-Siegenburg, Rohr in Niederbayern, and Rottenburg an der Laaber. On the same day, the French garrison of Regensburg capitulated.

After Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout&#x27;s hard-fought victory at Battle of Teugen-Hausen the previous day, Napoleon determined to break through the Austrian defenses behind the Abens River. The emperor assembled a provisional corps consisting of part of Davout&#x27;s corps plus cavalry and gave Marshal Jean Lannes command over it. Napoleon directed his German allies from the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Kingdom of Württemberg to attack across the Abens from the west, while Lannes thrust from the north toward Rohr. While the Austrians initially held the river line, Lannes&#x27; strike force crashed through Louis&#x27; defenses farther east. On the left, the Austrians managed to conduct a capable rear guard action, but during the day the French smashed their opponents&#x27; right flank and captured thousands of soldiers. The day ended with the Austrians barely holding onto a line behind the Große Laber River.

The next day, Hiller withdrew to Landshut, separating the left wing from the main army under Generalissimo Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen near Regensburg (Ratisbon). The French surrender of Regensburg on 20 April allowed Charles&#x27; army a retreat route to the north bank of the Danube. The Battle of Landshut was fought on 21 April.

==Background==
===Operations===
Archduke Charles stole a march on Napoleon when his army invaded the Kingdom of Bavaria on 10 April 1809. Even though the Austrian army took six days to slowly march from the Inn River at the frontier to the Isar River, the move placed the army of France and their German allies in grave danger. Napoleon&#x27;s deputy commander Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier mismanaged the Grande Armée&#x27;s concentration, leaving its units scattered across a broad front in a confused state.
The central mass of Archduke Charles&#x27; 209,600-man host crossed the Isar at Landshut on 16 April, but the next day Emperor Napoleon arrived at the front from Paris. Desperately trying to wrest the initiative back from the archduke, Napoleon consolidated his forces and ordered Marshal André Masséna&#x27;s IV Corps and General of Division Nicolas Oudinot&#x27;s II Corps on the right flank to march on Landshut to cut the Austrian line of communications. He planned for Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre&#x27;s Bavarian VII Corps to hold in the center at Abensberg while Davout&#x27;s left flank III Corps withdrew west to escape being trapped between Charles&#x27; main body and the Danube.

On 19 April, Charles realized he had an opportunity to destroy Davout. He launched 65,000 troops in three powerful columns northwest as Davout attempted a flank march across his front. Luckily for the French, General of Cavalry Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein&#x27;s 20,000 troops found no opposition on the Austrian right. In the center, General of Division Louis-Pierre Montbrun&#x27;s 3,800 cavalry and infantry skilfully held off Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini&#x27;s much stronger IV Armeekorps for most of the day.

On the left flank, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen&#x27;s III Armeekorps crashed into General of Division Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s division and a terrific fight blazed up. Both sides fed in reinforcements as the infantry battled over a pair of parallel ridges in the Battle of Teugen-Hausen. Ultimately, Davout brought superior forces to bear in the late afternoon and pushed back the Austrians a short ways. That night, Charles ordered Hohenzollern to withdraw a little to the east, closer to his main body.

On the morning of 19 April, Archduke Charles requested that Hohenzollern provide a link between the III and V Armeekorps. Accordingly, the III Armeekorps commander detached General-Major Ludwig Thierry&#x27;s 6,000-man infantry brigade to his left. As an additional link between Thierry and III Armeekorps, Hohenzollern detached General-Major Joseph Freiherr von Pfanzelter with a Grenz infantry battalion and two squadrons of hussars, about 1,000 men. While the Battle of Teugen-Hausen raged, Thierry clashed with Bavarian troops near Arnhofen and fell back to Offenstetten.

===Austrian deployment===

On 20 April, Archduke Charles&#x27; main body consisted of the III, IV, and I Reserve Armeekorps. These were arrayed near Dünzling and Eckmühl. Feldzeugmeister Johann Kollowrat&#x27;s II Armeekorps spent 19 April attacking Regensburg from north of the Danube. While successfully defending the city, Colonel Louis Coutard&#x27;s 2,000-man 65th Line Infantry Regiment ran dangerously low on small-arms ammunition. General of Cavalry Count Heinrich von Bellegarde&#x27;s I Armeekorps also remained north of the Danube.

Archduke Louis spread out his V Armeekorps behind the Abens River, facing west. Having detached Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Friedrich von Lindenau&#x27;s division to Liechtenstein, only the divisions of Feldmarschall-Leutnants Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen and Vincenz Freiherr von Schustekh-Herve remained under Louis&#x27; command. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer&#x27;s II Reserve Armeekorps, nominally 7,975-strong, waited in support at Ludmannsdorf. Kienmayer&#x27;s cuirassier brigade under General-Major Andreas von Schneller was serving with Liechtenstein and four dragoon squadrons were attached to Thierry&#x27;s brigade. On the evening of the 19th, the bulk of Hiller&#x27;s VI Armeekorps reached Mainburg to the south. Like V and II Reserve Armeekorps, the VI suffered from detachments. At the beginning of the war, Charles sent the division of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Jellacic to hold Munich, the Bavarian capital, where it remained. Hiller also posted General-Major Armand von Nordmann with a small force at Moosburg an der Isar to watch his south flank. The official returns of Hiller&#x27;s three corps totalled 75,880 troops, but after detachments, the left wing numbered only 42,000.

===French deployment===

When Lannes arrived at the front, Napoleon immediately placed him in command of a provisional corps. This ad hoc formation consisted largely of III Corps units that escaped Archduke Charles&#x27; trap the day before, namely General of Division Charles Antoine Morand&#x27;s 1st Division, General of Division Charles-Étienne Gudin de La Sablonnière&#x27;s 3rd Division, General of Division Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice&#x27;s 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division, and General of Brigade Charles Claude Jacquinot&#x27;s light cavalry brigade of Montbrun&#x27;s division. Also added was General of Division Etienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty&#x27;s 1st Heavy Cavalry Division from the cavalry reserve. One of Saint-Sulpice&#x27;s brigades was detailed to guard Saal an der Donau, a defile between Lannes and Davout.

On the morning of 20 April, Napoleon mistakenly assumed that the bulk of Archduke Charles&#x27; army lay in front of him. Accordingly, he gave orders for a drive southeast in the direction of Landshut. Lannes&#x27; mission was to turn the Austrian right flank by pushing south toward Rohr. General of Division Dominique Vandamme would attack Siegenburg with his small Kingdom of Württemberg corps. Lefebvre&#x27;s other VII Corps divisions, together with General of Division Joseph Laurent Demont&#x27;s Reserve Division of the III Corps, would link Lannes and Vandamme. Napoleon ordered Masséna&#x27;s IV Corps to capture Landshut and the Isar River crossings, cutting the Austrian line of communications.

==Battle==
===Abensberg===
Archduke Charles sent orders to his brother Archduke Louis at 7:30 AM on 20 April. He instructed Louis to fall back to Rottenburg and defend behind the Große Laber. Charles intended Hiller to take position on Louis&#x27; left at Pfeffenhausen. Charles erred in sending the orders so late and in not informing Louis of Hohenzollern&#x27;s withdrawal to the east. The latter move left the V Armeekorps&#x27; right flank exposed.

Pfanzelter held Bachl on the extreme right flank. To the west of Bachl, Thierry held Offenstetten with three and one-third battalions. His other two and two-thirds battalions had become separated the previous day and joined General-Major Frederick Bianchi, Duke of Casalanza who had six battalions near Biburg. Louis posted Schustekh with four squadrons of hussars and one and one-third battalions at Rohr. Schustekh&#x27;s infantry had just rejoined V Armeekorps after marching from Mainburg with General-Major Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Felsö-Kubiny&#x27;s detachment.
In one account, Lannes&#x27; advance guard approached Bachl in the late morning of 20 April, forcing Pfanzelter&#x27;s small detachment from the Austrian III Armeekorps eastward. The 1st Bavarian Division under Lieutenant General Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and the 3rd Bavarian Division led by Lieutenant General Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy, together with Demont&#x27;s III Corps Division advanced on Offenstetten. Around 10:00 AM, they defeated Thierry&#x27;s brigade, forcing him back on Bachl as Lannes approached from the north. Thierry hastily withdrew to Rohr, which he reached at 2:00 PM.

Historian James R. Arnold offers a different narrative. He writes that Pfanzelter&#x27;s command was withdrawn on the III Armeekorps commander Hohenzollern&#x27;s orders, leaving the north–south road through Bachl wide open. Meanwhile, Thierry&#x27;s attached dragoons discovered that Abensberg and its nearby roads were alive with moving columns of enemy troops. Around 8:00 AM, Thierry fell back on Bachl and found to his dismay that French cavalry already occupied the village. Having become separated from his supporting dragoons, Thierry&#x27;s men were chased into the woods by Jacquinot&#x27;s horsemen. From there the Austrians hiked cross-country toward Rohr.

Author Francis Loraine Petre states that Gudin encountered Pfanzelter north of Bachl and brushed him aside about 9:00 AM. The 1st Bavarian division and General-Major Hügel&#x27;s Württemberg brigade drove Thierry from Offenstetten around 10:00 AM. When the Austrians reached Bachl they stumbled upon Jacquinot who attacked and they &quot;scattered through the woods&quot;. Pfanzelter marched east to Langquaid where he rejoined Hohenzollern&#x27;s corps.

Because he feared that the woods to his left might contain Austrians, Lannes slowed his march so he could scout the terrain to the east. Even so, his column arrived at Rohr before Thierry&#x27;s infantry. Without Pfanzelter&#x27;s detachment to warn him, the arrival of Lannes&#x27; column surprised Schustekh. The Austrian commander gamely threw four squadrons of hussars at Jacquinot&#x27;s advance guard. Eventually, Jacquinot got his entire brigade into action and pressed the Austrian hussars back on the supporting battalion and one-third of Grenz infantry south of Rohr. At this time, Thierry&#x27;s winded infantry appeared on the scene. With the help of Gudin&#x27;s 17th Light Infantry and a battery of artillery, Jacquinot&#x27;s chasseurs broke Thierry&#x27;s foot soldiers and hounded them into the woods again.
To take the pressure off the infantry, Schustekh charged again, just as Thierry&#x27;s lost dragoons showed up. At first, the attack went well, but then the Austrian horsemen came up against a mass of cuirassiers. The result was a rout of the Habsburg cavalry, who rode through the ranks of their own foot soldiers. The French chasseurs and cuirassiers rode roughshod over the troops of Thierry and Mesko, cutting down the fugitives. Over 3,000 Austrians became prisoners, including Thierry, and four cannon were lost.

The previous evening, Hiller&#x27;s VI Armeekorps bivouacked at Mainburg. Though a road ran directly from Mainburg to Louis&#x27; left flank at Siegenburg, a distance of only 13 kilometers, Hiller elected to join his colleague by a roundabout march via Pfeffenhausen. Once he arrived, Hiller was authorized to take command of all three left wing corps. Hiller personally arrived in Siegenburg to confer with Archduke Louis around midday. Hearing troubling reports from the right flank, he sent Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl von Vincent toward Rottenburg with the line brigades of Generals-Major Josef Hoffmeister and Nikolaus Weissenwolf, plus four squadrons of the &quot;Rosenberg&quot; Chevauxlegers Regiment # 6. Petre names the two line infantry brigade commanders.

Archduke Louis posted Prince Reuss and General-Major Joseph Radetzky von Radetz with four battalions and 12 cavalry squadrons at Siegenburg. Bianchi held the east bank of the Abens opposite Biburg. Lieutenant-General Karl Philipp von Wrede probed at Siegenburg but his 2nd Bavarian Division was easily fended off by Radetzky and a battery of 12-pdr cannon. At this time, Louis heard that the French attacked Thierry, so he ordered Radetzky to send two battalions to the right flank and called up Kienmayer&#x27;s command from Ludmannsdorf.
Wrede moved north to Biburg, where he tried to get across the Abens again. At first he was not successful, but Bianchi withdrew to Kirchdorf, allowing the 2nd Bavarian Division to cross to the east bank of the stream. Meanwhile, General of Division Dominique Vandamme&#x27;s Württemberg contingent (later known as the VIII Corps) replaced Wrede in front of Siegenburg. Vandamme soon realized that crossing at Siegenburg was futile, so he too marched north, crossed the river at Abensberg and moved south to Kirchdorf. Here the Bavarians and Württembergers found Bianchi with his reinforced brigade and a cavalry squadron. Reuss soon arrived with Radetzky&#x27;s two battalions. Around 2:00 PM a sharp combat took place after which the Austrians retreated to the southeast. According to one account, General of Division Jean Victor Tharreau&#x27;s cavalry of the II Corps also became involved at Kirchdorf.

Pressed by Wrede&#x27;s 7th Bavarian Infantry Regiment, plus two of Hügel&#x27;s Württemberg battalions, Radetzky conducted an orderly retreat on the Siegenburg road, covered by the grenzers and Kienmayer&#x27;s grenadiers under General-Major Konstantin Ghilian Karl d&#x27;Aspré. He managed to shepherd the V Armeekorps trains safely through Pfeffenhausen before the Bavarians cut him off. Wrede pursued aggressively and scooped up many prisoners but failed to capture the bridge, which the Austrians burned. Even so, the Bavarians kept up the pressure, crossing the shallow Große Laber at 11:00 PM to attack. Radetzky fell back to a hill called the Hornbach where his rear guard skirmished with the Bavarians into the early morning hours.

When Vincent&#x27;s column neared Rottenburg, he found the road jammed with the III Armeekorps trains. A charge by the &quot;Rosenberg&quot; Chevauxlegers halted the French cuirassiers long enough for his infantry to gain solid positions on the east side of the Große Laber. Hiller arrived at Rottenburg in the late afternoon and ordered a counterattack at 7:00 PM. Vincent swung his left brigade forward and quickly overran a Bavarian unit, capturing 300 troops. Soon after, the &quot;Deutschmeister&quot; Infantry Regiment # 4 got into a vicious firefight with Bavarian and French infantry. In the twilight, the Austrians were forced back by superior numbers with 600 casualties, but they had finally stopped their enemies.

===Regensburg===

On 20 April, the Austrian II Armeekorps continued attacking Colonel Louis Coutard&#x27;s 65th Line Infantry Regiment at Regensburg. A French convoy sent to replenish the critically low ammunition supply was ambushed by Austrian cavalry at 8:00 AM. The French troops finally ran out of ammunition and Coutard asked Kollowrat for a 24-hour truce after which he promised to surrender if not relieved. The Austrian commander foolishly agreed to the terms.

However, Liechtenstein&#x27;s column soon appeared from the south. Liechtenstein pointed out that the existing truce did not apply to him and demanded an immediate surrender. Coutard thereupon capitulated at 5:00 PM. The French sappers had found it impossible to demolish the sturdily-built Regensburg bridge. The intact bridge later played a key factor in the escape of Charles&#x27; army. In two days of fighting, the French lost 11 officers and about 200 soldiers killed and wounded, plus 1,988 captured. Austrian losses were 73 dead, 220 wounded, and 85 missing for a total of 378 casualties. During the struggle the French captured 75 troops and one color, all of which were recovered.

When Kollowrat finally reported the II Armeekorps available for duty that evening, the headquarters ordered his troops to make an overnight march west to Hemau on the north bank of the Danube. In the morning, the tired troops were recalled to Regensburg from their pointless ramble.

==Aftermath==
Arnold lists 1,107 Allied casualties, including 746 Bavarians. He gives Austrian losses as 492 killed, 2,219 wounded, and nearly 4,000 captured, or a total of 6,711. The French also captured eight colors and 12 cannons. Digby Smith notes Allied casualties as 34 dead and 438 wounded, but this seems to count only the German allied troops. Austrian total losses are given as 6,872, including 3,000 to 4,000 captured. The 2nd battalion of the &quot;Broder&quot; Grenz (Mesko&#x27;s brigade) was annihilated, with 18 officers and 1,040 rank and file counted as lost. Smith gives killed, wounded, captured, and missing, but the numbers only add up to 5,824 so they are not listed. Petre lists 2,710 Austrians killed and wounded, plus about 4,000 captured. Altogether, the 42,000 troops of Hiller&#x27;s three-corps left wing faced 55,000 French and their German allies. Only about 25,000 Austrians and an equal number of Allies were engaged in action. More recent scholarship by John H. Gill attributes losses of 7,200 men and 12 guns to Austrian forces, and 1,000 to French and French-allied forces.
That evening, as the extent of Thierry and Schustekh&#x27;s disaster became known, Hiller resolved to pull his three corps behind the Isar at Landshut. In this decision, he was also influenced by Masséna&#x27;s move against his left rear and unfavorable reports from Archduke Louis. This crucial decision meant that the Austrian left wing would in the near future operate independently from Archduke Charles&#x27; main body. Hiller would only reunite with his army commander on 15 May north of Vienna.

While Napoleon savaged his left wing, Archduke Charles remained amazingly inert. At 6:00 AM, the archduke was with Prince Rosenberg and at 7:30 AM he sent orders to Archduke Louis and then wrote a letter to Emperor Francis I of Austria. But from 11:00 AM until 6:30 PM, the Austrian generalissimo failed to issue any orders. He either became obsessed with capturing Regensburg or he had an epileptic seizure during which he is supposed to have locked himself in his quarters. The epileptic attack is probable, but there is a possibility it may be a cover story for Charles&#x27; failure to exercise command. What is known is that the Austrian III, IV, and I Reserve Armeekorps did not disturb Davout&#x27;s remaining three divisions under Generals of Division Louis Friant, Saint-Hilaire, and Montbrun on 20 April.

Despite being outnumbered, Napoleon&#x27;s 113,000 troops split the 161,000 strung-out Austrians into two forces. Charles five corps, including 48,000 additional troops of the I and II Armeekorps north of Regensburg, lay to the north while Hiller&#x27;s three corps fell back to Landshut. (Massena and Oudinot&#x27;s 57,000 soldiers are not counted in Napoleon&#x27;s total.) Both Austrian forces had to fight a second major battle each. Hiller fought the Battle of Landshut on 21 April, while Charles engaged in the Battle of Eckmühl on the 22nd.

<text>During the 1920s and 1930s, the United States Armed Forces developed a number of color-coded war plans that outlined potential US strategies for a variety of hypothetical war scenarios. The plans, developed by the Joint Planning Committee (which later became the Joint Chiefs of Staff), were officially withdrawn in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II in favor of five &quot;Rainbow&quot; plans developed to meet the threat of a two-ocean war against multiple enemies.

==List of color plans==
The following plans are known to have existed:

; War Plan Black
: A plan for war with Germany. The best-known version of Black was conceived as a contingency plan during World War I in case France fell, and the Germans attempted to seize the French West Indies in the Caribbean Sea, or launch an attack on the eastern seaboard.
; War Plan Gray
: There were two war plans named Gray. The first dealt with Central America and the Caribbean, and the second dealt with invading the Portuguese Azores.
; War Plan Brown
: Dealt with an uprising in the Philippines.
; War Plan Tan
: Intervention in Cuba.
; War Plan Red
: Plan for the British Empire, with specific subvariants for the British dominions:
:* Crimson: Canada
:* Ruby: India
:* Scarlet: Australia
:* Garnet: New Zealand
:* Emerald: Irish Free State
; War Plan Orange
: Plan for the Empire of Japan.
; War Plan Red-Orange
: Considered a two-front war with the United States (Blue) opposing the Empire of Japan (Orange) and the British Empire (Red) simultaneously (the Anglo-Japanese Alliance). This analysis led to the understanding that the United States did not have the resources to fight a two-front war. As a result, it was decided that one front should be prioritized for offense while the other was to be defensive, for war against British territories in North America and the Atlantic and against Britain and Japan in the Pacific respectively. This decision resulted in the Plan Dog memo during World War II, replacing Britain with Germany and Italy instead.
; War Plan Yellow
: Dealt with war in China—specifically, anticipating a repeat of the Boxer Uprising (1899–1901). War Plan Yellow would deploy the US Army in coalition with other imperial forces to suppress indigenous discontent in the Shanghai International Settlement and Beijing Legation Quarter, with chemical weapons if necessary.
; War Plan Gold
: Involved war with France and/or France&#x27;s Caribbean colonies.
; War Plan Green
: Involved war with Mexico or what was known as &quot;Mexican Domestic Intervention&quot; in order to defeat rebel forces and establish a pro-American government. War Plan Green was officially canceled in 1946.
; War Plan Indigo
: Involved an occupation of Iceland. In 1941, while Denmark was under German occupation, the US actually did occupy Iceland, relieving British units during the Battle of the Atlantic.
; War Plan Purple
: Dealt with invading a South American republic.
; War Plan Violet
: Covered Latin America.
; War Plan White
: Dealt with a domestic uprising in the US and later evolved to Operation Garden Plot, the general US military plan for civil disturbances and peaceful protests. Parts of War Plan White were used to deal with the Bonus Expeditionary Force in 1932. Communist insurgents were considered the most likely threat by the authors of War Plan White.
; War Plan Blue
: Covered defensive plans and preparations that the United States should take in times of peace.

No war plan has been constructed toward the Soviet Union.
==Colors==
The desire for the Army and Navy to utilize the same symbols for their plans gave rise to the use of colors in US war planning. By the end of 1904, the Joint Board had adopted a system of hues, symbols, and shorthand names to represent nations. Many war plans became known by the color of the country to which they were related, a convention that lasted through World War II. As the convention of using colors took root, some were eventually reused, such as Grey, which originally referred to Italy but eventually became a plan for the capture and occupation of Portugal&#x27;s Azores. In all the plans, the US referred to itself as &quot;Blue&quot;.

The plan that received the most consideration was War Plan Orange, a series of contingency plans for fighting a war with Japan alone, outlined unofficially in 1919 and officially in 1924. Orange formed some of the basis for the actual campaign against Japan in World War II and included the huge economic blockade from mainland China and the plans for interning the Japanese American population.

War Plan Red was a plan for war against the British Empire. British dominions and colonies had war plans of different shades of red: the United Kingdom was &quot;Red&quot;, Canada &quot;Crimson&quot;, India &quot;Ruby&quot;, Australia &quot;Scarlet&quot;, and New Zealand &quot;Garnet&quot;. Ireland, at the time a free state within the British Empire, was named &quot;Emerald&quot;.

War Plan Black was a plan for war with Germany. The best-known version of Black was conceived as a contingency plan during World War I in case France fell and the Germans attempted to seize French possessions in the Caribbean or launch an attack on the eastern seaboard.

==Considerations==
Many of the war plans were extremely unlikely given the state of international relations in the 1920s and were entirely in keeping with the military planning of other nation-states. Often, junior military officers were given the task of updating each plan to keep them trained and busy (especially in the case of War Plan Crimson, the invasion of Canada). Some of the war plan colors were revised over time, possibly resulting in confusion. 

Although the US had fought its most recent war against Germany and would fight another within twenty years, intense domestic pressure emerged for the Army to halt when it became known that the Army was constructing a plan for a war with Germany; isolationists opposed any consideration of involvement in a future European conflict. This may have encouraged the Army to focus on more speculative scenarios for planning exercises.

==Americas==

===War Plan Green===
During the 1910s, relations between Mexico and the United States were often volatile. In 1912, US President William Howard Taft considered sending an expeditionary force to protect foreign-owned property from damage during the Mexican Revolution. Thus, War Plan Green was developed. In 1916, US troops under General John Pershing invaded Mexico in search of Pancho Villa, whose army had attacked Columbus, New Mexico; earlier, American naval forces had bombarded and seized the Mexican port of Veracruz and forced Victoriano Huerta to resign the presidency. In 1917, British intelligence intercepted a telegram from the German foreign ministry to its embassy in Mexico City offering an alliance against the United States and assistance in the Mexican reconquest of the Southwest. Released to American newspapers, the Zimmermann Telegram helped turn American opinion against Germany and further poisoned the atmosphere between the US and Mexico. Relations with Mexico remained tense into the 1920s and 1930s.

===Beyond Mexico===
Between the American Civil War and World War I, the American military intervened in the affairs of Latin American countries, including Colombia, Panama, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. In doing so, parts of &quot;Gray&quot; and &quot;Purple&quot;, plans were considered although never officially activated.

===Multilateral war plans===
Some plans were expanded to include war against a coalition of hostile powers. The most detailed was War Plan Red-Orange, which detailed a two-front war against Britain and Japan. This was the contingency which most worried US war planners, since it entailed a two-ocean war against major naval powers. Although the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance was terminated by the 1921 Four-Power Treaty, American generals did not rule out the possibility of Britain wanting to seek an alliance with Japan again if war ever broke out. Theories developed in War Plan Red-Orange were useful during World War II, when the United States engaged the Axis powers in both the Atlantic and Pacific simultaneously.

==Rainbow plans==
Japan took the opportunity afforded by World War I to establish itself as a major strategic power in the Pacific Ocean. Most American officials and planners then considered a war with Japan to be highly likely. The fear lessened when the civilian government of Japan temporarily halted its program of military expansion, but it was resumed in 1931. War Plan Orange was the longest and most detailed of the color-designated plans.

However, following the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and events in Europe in 1938—1940 (the Anschluss, the Munich Agreement, the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the German invasion of Poland and Western Europe), American war planners realized that the United States faced war on multiple fronts against a coalition of enemies. Therefore, the Joint Planning Board developed a new series of &quot;Rainbow&quot; plans—the term being a logical extension of the previous &quot;color&quot; plans.

* Rainbow 1 was a plan for a defensive war to protect the United States and the Western Hemisphere north of ten degrees [south] latitude. In such a war, the United States was assumed to be without major allies.
* Rainbow 2 was identical to Rainbow 1, except for assuming that the United States would be allied with France and the United Kingdom.
* Rainbow 3 was a repetition of the Orange plan, with the provision that the hemisphere defense would first be secured, as provided in Rainbow 1.
* Rainbow 4 was based on the same assumptions as Rainbow 1 but extended the American mission to include defense of the entire Western hemisphere.
* Rainbow 5, destined to be the basis for American strategy in World War II, assumed that the United States was allied with Britain and France and additionally provided for offensive operations by American forces in Europe, Africa, or both.

The assumptions and plans for Rainbow 5 were discussed extensively in the Plan Dog memo, which concluded ultimately that the United States would adhere to a Europe first strategy in World War II.

===Leak of the Rainbow 5 plan===
On December 4, 1941, three days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, with the headline &quot;F. D. R.&#x27;s War Plans!&quot;, along with &quot;The Times Herald&quot; of Washington, D.C., published the Rainbow Five plan. The articles, both by the &quot;Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Washington correspondent, Chesly Manly, revealed plans to build a 10-million-man Army with a five-million-man expeditionary force to be sent to Europe in 1943 in order to defeat Nazi Germany. 

The publication ignited a storm of controversy in the US, with isolationist politicians claiming Roosevelt was violating his pledge to keep the country out of the European war, while Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson accused the newspapers of unpatriotic behavior and suggested it would be a dereliction of duty for the War Department not to plan for every contingency. Germany publicly ridiculed the plan the next day, doubting &quot;whether the entire world shipping would be sufficient to transport 5,000,000 troops to Europe, much less supply them there.&quot; 

Privately, the German general staff saw the publication of the plans as extremely valuable intelligence and used its threat of a five-million-man US force in 1943 to argue for temporarily stalling the faltering invasion of the Soviet Union, and concentrating German forces in the west. Adolf Hitler vehemently rejected that idea. Historian Thomas Fleming suggests that Germany might have prevailed against the UK and the US if he had not. The source of the leak has never been determined, with speculation listing several possibilities, including disgruntled or isolationist military officers and even President Roosevelt himself.

<text>Thomas White Ferry (June 10, 1827October 13, 1896), or T. W. Ferry, represented Michigan in the United States House of Representatives and then in the United States Senate. Ferry served as president pro tempore of the Senate during the 44th and 45th Congresses.

==Biography==
=== Birth and early life ===
Ferry was born in the old Mission House on Mackinac Island in the Territory of Michigan. The community on Mackinac at that time included the military garrison, the main depot of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company, and the mission. His father, Rev. William Montague Ferry, was a Presbyterian pastor, and his mother was Amanda White Ferry. His parents ran the mission school on the island.

William Ferry also was the pastor of the Protestant church on the island. Thomas moved in 1834 with his parents to Grand Haven, Michigan, attended the public schools. He worked as a store clerk in Elgin, Illinois, for two years from 1843 to 1845 before returning to Michigan. At the age of 21 he was elected clerk of Ottawa County.

In addition to English, Ferry was fluent in Ottawa, Chippewa, and French.

== Political career ==

===State legislator===
Ferry was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives from 1850 to 1852 and a member of the Michigan State Senate in 1856. On January 26, 1857, Ferry, along with his father, platted the village of Ferrysburg, Michigan.

=== Years between state and federal office ===
In 1862 Ferry became a director of the new Grand Haven Union High School and was superintendent for ten years. He went into the lumbering business with his brother, Edward Payson Ferry. Before the Civil War he served on the Republican State Central Committee for eight years and was delegate-at-large and one of the vice presidents of the national convention that nominated Abraham Lincoln. Upon President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s death, he was appointed by the U.S. Senate to a committee that accompanied Lincoln&#x27;s body to Springfield.

===United States Representative===
He was a delegate to the Loyalist Convention at Philadelphia in 1866. He was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives for the 39th, 40th, and 41st Congresses, serving from March 4, 1865 to March 3, 1871. He was re-elected to the U.S. House for the 42nd Congress in the general election of November 8, 1870. The Michigan Legislature subsequently elected him to the U.S. Senate on January 18, 1871, and Wilder D. Foster was elected in a special election on April 4, 1871, to fill his vacancy in the House.

On April 2, 1868, he testified in the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, having been called as a witness by the prosecution.

One of Ferry&#x27;s lasting legacies in the house is the clearing of the floor prior to the start of a session. On March 31, 1869, Ferry moved that the House adopt a rule which required the House Doorkeeper to clear the floor of visitors and non-privileged employees ten minutes before the start of a session. The rule was later changed to fifteen minutes.

=== United States Senator ===
Ferry was re-elected to the Senate in 1871, and served from March 4, 1871 to March 3, 1883. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1882. Ferry was the first person from Michigan to have served in both houses of the Michigan State Legislature and in both houses of the United States Congress.

During the &quot;Panic of 1873&quot;, economic deflation caused serious problems and Ferry became a face of the Republican inflationist movement. Congress hoped inflation would stimulate the economy and passed the Ferry Bill (introduced by Senator Ferry), which became known as the &quot;Inflation Bill&quot; in 1874. Many farmers and workingmen favored the bill, which would have added $64 million in greenbacks to circulation, but some Eastern bankers opposed it because it would have weakened the dollar. The bill passed the Senate and House of Representatives, but was vetoed by President Grant. An override attempt failed 34–30 in the Senate. This is one of the few bills vetoed by a member of the same party as a bills sponsor.

While senator, Ferry was chairman of the Committee on Rules and the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads (46th and 47th Congresses), as well as President pro tempore of the Senate during the 44th and 45th Congresses.

=== First-in-line for the presidency ===

On November 22, 1875, Vice President Henry Wilson died. Ferry, being president pro tempore of the Senate, became first in the line of presidential succession, and remained so until March 3, 1877. During this time he was regarded as acting vice president of the United States The title of &quot;acting vice president&quot; is not defined in the Constitution, but was widely used at the time (including by Ferry himself).

Ferry presided over the 1876 impeachment trial of U.S. Secretary of War William Belknap and the meetings of the Electoral Commission created by Congress to resolve the disputed 1876 presidential election. Still president pro tempore at that time, he would have temporally become the acting president had the Electoral College vote not been certified by March 4, 1877. Congress certified Rutherford B. Hayes as the winner of the Electoral College vote on March 2.

On July 4, 1876, the United States celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence with a ceremony in Philadelphia at Independence Hall. President Grant was supposed to attend and lead the ceremony, but instead sent Ferry (as acting vice president) in his place. While Ferry was officiating, five women, headed by Susan B. Anthony, walked onto the platform and handed their &quot;Declaration of Rights&quot; to Ferry. As they were being taken off the stage, they threw out copies to the crowd. Anthony also read the Declaration to a large crowd and invited everyone to a National Woman Suffrage Association convention nearby.

=== 1882 election ===

Ferry&#x27;s 1882 election saw national attention. Political opponent Jay Hubbell, created the &quot;Grand Army Journal&quot; newspaper. This libelous publication was almost universally denounced. Its sole purpose was to defame Senator Ferry. Hubbell sought to take his place in the Senate by throwing slanderous headlines in his &quot;Journal&quot; which he mailed out by the thousands.

Word of this fake publication took its toll on both men. Thousands of Michiganders had read this publication and, though untrue, it had tarnished Ferry&#x27;s image. Hubbell was despised by many Michiganders for fabricating lies about Michigan&#x27;s most powerful politician. Hubbell withdrew from the election.

Hubbell was not the only one waging war with Ferry. The Grand Rapids Times published a story labeling Ferry as unfit for office. They accused Ferry of drunkenly insulting patrons of a Washington DC Hotel. There were no first hand accounts that this took place. The Hotel proprietor, staff, and many colleagues on both sides of the aisle disputed the story and claimed Ferry did not drink and had been the perfect guest for the 12 years he had spent there.

It was said in the Chicago Inter-Ocean newspaper that, &quot;A more malignant and unscrupulous campaign has never been conducted against any man, and whether Ferry wins or losses, the effect of this contest will be felt in Michigan for some time to come.&quot; The story continues to say, &quot;If Michigan withdraws him and sends a new man, the State will thus surrender its standing on committees in Congress, much of its relative influence there; and what Michigan thus loses other States will gain.&quot;

After these personal attacks, Ferry could see his political life coming to an end. He withdrew from the election and advocated for the nomination of close friend Thomas Palmer. Palmer went on to replace Ferry in the Senate, much to the dismay of Ferry&#x27;s political rivals.

== Later life and death ==

Following his political defeat, Ferry travelled in Europe for three years to recover his mental and physical health. When he returned to Grand Haven in 1886 he worked to manage his businesses and repay his debts.

Ferry had interests in mining, lumber, and iron businesses. Towards the late 1800s the west Michigan lumber Industry had dried up. This along with political foes targeting his Ottawa Iron Works business caused Ferry&#x27;s companies to declare bankruptcy. Along with liquidating business assets, Ferry spent over $1,250,000 ($36,000,000 in 2021 dollars) to pay his personal debts.

Ferry never married, but was engaged on multiple occasions. Ferry was considered to be one of Washington&#x27;s most eligible bachelors. He was described as being wealthy, charismatic, handsome, and powerful. One Philadelphia newspaper called him the &quot;lady-killer&quot; of his day who &quot;never fails to gather a harvest of hearts during their proper season.&quot;

Once an immensely wealthy man, Ferry fell into financial disaster following his political defeat. He spent his final years hidden from the national spotlight. Ferry died in Grand Haven, Michigan, at age 69. He is interred in Grand Haven&#x27;s Lake Forest Cemetery in the Ferry family plot. His epitaph reads,

<text>Barrick Gold Corporation is a mining company that produces gold and copper with 16 operating sites in 13 countries. It is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It has mining operations in Argentina, Canada, Chile, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Mali, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, the United States and Zambia. In 2023, it produced 4.05 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,335/ounce and 420 million pounds of copper at all-in sustaining costs of $3.21/pound. the company had 77 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves.

Barrick had been the world&#x27;s largest gold mining company until Newmont acquired Goldcorp in 2019. Barrick expects to produce between 3.9 and 4.3 million ounces of gold and between 180 and 210 million tonnes of copper in 2024.

Chief executive Mark Bristow said in 2020 that Barrick has debated moving its primary stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange from the Toronto Stock Exchange, broadening its exposure to potential investors.

==History==

===Founding and early years===

====Barrick Resources====
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company, Barrick Resources. After suffering financial losses in oil and gas, founder Peter Munk (1927–2018) decided to refocus the company on gold. Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983, listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

===1986 to 2005===

==== Goldstrike ====

In the 1980s, Barrick Gold purchased Goldstrike, which was a rapid success making Barrick one of the biggest gold mining companies globally.

====American Barrick====
Reflecting its identity as a North American producer, distinct from its South African competitors, the company&#x27;s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986. It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987. Its name was changed to Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.

====Barrick Gold Corporation====
American Barrick became the third-largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired Lac Minerals in 1994, which owned mining properties in North and South America. Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation. A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd., assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania. In 2001, Barrick acquired Homestake Mining Company for $2.3 billion in stock, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States. The purchase made Barrick the second-largest gold producer in the world.

===Placer Dome acquisition===
In December 2005, Barrick launched a hostile takeover bid valued at US$9.2 billion for rival Canadian gold miner Placer Dome. The $10.4 billion transaction closed in December 2006. The acquisition of Placer Dome by Barrick made Barrick the operator of the Granny Smith, Osborne, Porgera, South Deep, Bald Mountain, Cortez and Golden Sunlight mines.

===2006 to present===

====African Barrick Gold====
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold. Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion. The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds. In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.

====Equinox Minerals====
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.

====Shandong Gold====
In 2018, John L. Thornton orchestrated a strategic “trust-based relationship” between Barrick Gold and Shandong Gold Group, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, establishing joint ownership of the Veladero mine to capitalize on Shandong&#x27;s investor base, capital suppliers, political connections, and regional influence. In the press release announcing the partnership, Thornton said that Barrick and Shandong were looking forward to “sharing... capital in ways that will create added value for our respective owners, and our government and community partners in San Juan province”.

====Randgold Resources====
In September 2018, Barrick Gold announced an all-stock merger with Randgold Resources in a deal valued at $6.5 billion. Immediately following the announcement of the merger, Randgold shares rose 6% and Barrick shares rose 5.6%. The deal created the world&#x27;s largest gold producer with the new company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. The companies began talking about a combination in 2015 and the deal was orchestrated by Barrick Executive Chairman John L. Thornton and Randgold Founder and CEO Mark Bristow, who became CEO of the merged company.

====Newmont Corporation====
In February 2019, Barrick Gold announced a hostile $19 billion bid to acquire Newmont. It was estimated that a merger could create $7 billion of value in operational synergies and would result in a 14% rise in Newmont&#x27;s net asset value per share. The deal would have created a gold mining company with a market value of about $42 billion that some said would be a long-overdue restructuring of the global gold industry. Merging gold companies could make the industry more attractive to general investors as gold reserves are shrinking across the globe so fewer competitors could boost growth prospects. Newmont rejected the takeover offer and instead suggested the two companies&#x27; operations in Nevada, USA, be merged with Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg insisting that the joint venture be operated by Newmont with the two companies dividing the ownership equally. A joint venture was subsequently announced in March 2019 with Barrick as the operator owning 61.5% of the business.

====Nevada Gold Mines====
On July 1, 2019, Barrick and Newmont launched Nevada Gold Mines. The combined operation is the single largest gold mining complex in the world and employs more than 7,000 people. It combined the mines Goldstrike, Cortez, Turquoise Ridge, and Goldrush from Barrick and Newmont&#x27;s Carlin, Twin Creeks, Phoenix, Long Canyon sites, plus the associated processing plants and infrastructure of both companies. The joint venture was created after Barrick gave up a takeover bid for Newmont in early 2019.

Nevada Gold Mines in total comprises 10 underground and 12 opencast mines, two autoclave facilities, two roasting facilities, four oxide mills, a flotation plant and five heap leach facilities. Barrick owns 61.5% of the joint venture and operates the business, while Newmont owns 38.5%. It was estimated that $500 million could be saved by creating the joint venture in average annual synergies during the first five years of operating the joint venture. After its first year of operation, $35 million in operating and management costs were saved. Over 20 years, it is estimated that $4.7 billion of total savings will be realised.

====Reko Diq Project====

Pakistan plans to grant Barrick a mining lease, exploration license and surface rights to restart the Reko Diq copper-gold project, it was announced in March 2022. The project when in production has the potential to be one of the top five gold-copper mines in the world. It has the potential to produce 250,000 ounces of gold and 200,000 tons of copper every year for more than half a century and could be in production by 2027. It was estimated that the project site contains up to 42 million ounces of gold and 54 billion pounds of copper in a study done in 2010. The mineral deposit was discovered at the foot of an extinct volcano in the 2000s. Work on the project was stopped in 2011 when a mining license to develop the Reko Diq mine was refused to be granted by Pakistani authorities. Ownership of the mine is to be split evenly between Pakistan and Barrick, which are investing about $10 billion in the project, which is the single largest investment in the country. About 8,000 jobs are expected to be created and about $1 billion will be invested in a new mining technical school along with hospital, schools and roads in the province of Balochistan, which is poor and sparsely populated. Construction of the mine will take place in two phases beginning with a processing plant with the capacity of 40 million tonnes per year and doubling five years after being commissioned.

The federal government of Pakistan and provincial government of Baluchistan have called the agreement with Barrick Gold to develop the Reko Diq copper-gold project the largest investment pact they have ever made. The agreement signed in December 2022 has the province of Baluchistan owning 10% of the project on a free carried basis, 15% on a fully funded basis, 25% by three state-owned enterprises, and 50% by Barrick Gold. Next steps to ramp-up the project include completing the updated feasibility study by the end of 2024 with first production of gold and copper to occur in 2028.

== Berkshire Hathaway ==
Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it purchased $562 million in shares of Barrick during the second quarter of 2020, immediately making it the eleventh-largest shareholder in the company. The new position is 20.9 million shares, which is 1.2% of the company&#x27;s outstanding stock. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett and his key business partner Charlie Munger have a history of dismissing gold as an attractive investment, saying a fine business run by good managers with cash flows and paying dividends is more productive than the precious metal. Buffett has previously said owning shares of quality companies is more valuable than owning gold itself. Buffett later sold his entire stake in the company in 2021.

==Operations==

===Copper===
===Former operations===

==Mining practices==
Environmental and human rights violations have taken place around a number of mining operations that are now closed or were previously operated by a different company, including violence in Papua New Guinea and Tanzania. Forty people were arrested in Chile following a demonstration against the potential environmental impacts of a mining project that has not been built. Executives of Acacia Mining, which had mining operations in Tanzania and was acquired in 2019, had faced charges of bribery, conspiracy, forgery, money-laundering, tax-evasion and environmental damage. There has also been small groups of opposition in the Dominican Republic.

===Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights===
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights which provides &quot;guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms.&quot; Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary, the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations. Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact. The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy. In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.

===Argentina===

====Environment====
Between 2015 and 2017, three separate incidents occurred where processing solution containing cyanide escaped the leach pad area. In September 2015, 1,072m3 of cyanide processing solution was released from a faulty valve on a pipe going to the heap leach pad and was not diverted to the tailings storage facility because of a malfunctioning gate. In September 2016, a pipe carrying cyanide processing solution was struck by falling ice that had rolled down a slope, and in March 2017, a pipe carrying a mixture of rocks came loose. After the first accident in 2015, local judge Pablo Oritja of Argentina indicted nine employees, and a fine of $9.8 million was levied. Authorities in San Juan province responded with plans to re-engineer some operational and environmental processes at the mine, which were audited by local and international experts. The &quot;National Observer&quot; obtained court documents with allegations from a former employee that his employment was terminated soon after concerns were raised about health and safety and environmental practices in 2014.

====2016 Class Action Lawsuit====
A U.S. class-action lawsuit was launched in 2016 accusing the company of fraudulently inflating its market value by concealing problems at Pascua Lama, a South American mine under development. Development of the mine was indefinitely halted on October 31, 2013, and people who purchased shares between May 7, 2009, and November 1, 2013, were part of the class-action lawsuit. Development was halted for a number of issues including cost overruns, environmental concerns and the falling price of gold that would have made the operation less economical. A $140 million settlement was reached two months later with no charges of wrongdoing or liability and the company stating the claims alleged by the lead plaintiffs are unfounded.

===Canada===

====Talonbooks====
In February 2010, lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book &quot;Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World&#x27;s Mining Industries&quot; by Alain Deneault. Publisher Karl Siegler described this as &quot;libel chill,&quot; pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation. Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work () and &quot;issued a statement saying they &#x27;intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book&#x27;s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to &quot;correct&quot; any &quot;falsehoods&quot; about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain.&#x27;&quot;

====Noir Canada====
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher, and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc to prepare their defense in a &quot;seemingly abusive&quot; strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book &quot;Noir Canada&quot; documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict, and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half-year legal battle.

=== Papua New Guinea - Porgera Gold Mine ===
====Human Rights Abuses====
In 2011, Human Rights Watch, a New York City-based international non-governmental organization that conducts research on human rights, found a pattern of abuses perpetrated by private and public law-enforcement personnel in 2009 and 2010 in the Porgera Gold Mine in Papua New Guinea. Human Rights Watch says that violent insecurity is a “chronic problem” around Porgera due to people engaging in illegal mining and continuously raiding various areas of the mining property including the open pit, stockpile areas for rock, waste dumps, and underground tunnels. Human Rights Watch said the government of Papua New Guinea has “consistently failed” to maintain law and order in the area and that responsible government regulation was the one essential component still lacking to manage the unstable social situation in the area. On the same day Human Rights Watch published its report, the company said it had been working with Human Rights Watch for six months on a series of actions in response to the investigation, which included improvements to the security environment, enhanced human rights training, and grievance mechanisms. A “remedy framework” called the Porgera Remedy Framework was set up as an alternative to the local judicial system to deliver compensation packages. In June 2014, Amnesty International reported that local police forced evictions by way of arson from land adjacent to the mine. The report said that community leaders presumed the alleged actions by the police were an effort to prevent illegal mining. Journalist Richard Poplak visited the area around the mine in 2016 and reported that Papua New Guinea could be the most dangerous country in the world to be female and that law and order in the country is lacking. He reported that rumours of sexual violence in the Porgera Valley began in 2005 and by 2011 there were hundreds of allegations. Several victims received compensation through a remediation program that was set up in 2012 but was later criticized as other victims who took legal action instead of participating in the remediation program received higher compensation after reportedly settling out of court for a sum that was higher than offered in the remediation program.

==== Ownership ====
Soon after the Human Rights Watch 2011 publication, the mine, which was owned jointly by Barrick, Zijin Mining Group of China, and local landowners through Mineral Resources Enga, was nationalized by the government of Papua New Guinea under Prime Minister James Marape when the government did not renew the mining lease, and it expired in August 2019. The gold mine, which contributes about 10% of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s total exports, was seen by Prime Minister James Marape as a way for the country to get a greater share of its major natural resource projects. Two new deals forged in 2021 gave the Papua New Guinea government a majority stake in the operations of the Porgera gold mine and an agreement reached in 2023 renewed the special mining lease so that operations could restart that year.

==== Environmental concerns ====
At the Porgera Joint Venture in Papua New Guinea, the material that remains after extracting gold from ore is processed into tailings and sent off the mining property.
Critics say the tailings disposal method could release harmful materials in a way that would not be allowed under the water quality expectations of a developed country. The Porgera Joint Venture is one of three large mines that dispose of tailings in this way in the country.

===Peru===
In February 2021, Barrick Gold announced it would sell its Lagunas Norte mine in Peru. The mine is sold to Boroo Pte Ltd. for up to US$81 million.

====Water====
The BBC reported in September 2012 that one person was killed and at least four more were injured at the Barrick Pierina mine in the northern Ancash region of Peru in clashes between national police and members of a neighboring community who were protesting the mine&#x27;s alleged over-consumption and contamination of local water sources during a drought. Villagers from the communities of Mareniyoc and San Isidro blocked an access road to the mine and entered the property by forcing open the mine gate. Community members asked that the mine provide the communities with drinking water. Operations at the mine resumed after two days.

===United States===

====Cortez Hills====
Through 2009 and into 2010, Barrick Gold&#x27;s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project. Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project. The Appeals Court &quot;upheld a federal judge&#x27;s finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes&#x27; ability to exercise their religion&quot; but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts &quot;was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act&quot; and ordered the District Court to provide &quot;appropriate&quot; injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study. In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.

====Western Shoshone====
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes&#x27; discretion. A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as &quot;a pretty progressive entity.&quot; In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.

<text>Missouri Executive Order 44 (known as the Mormon Extermination Order) was a state executive order issued by Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs on October 27, 1838, in response to the Battle of Crooked River. The clash had been triggered when a state militia unit from Ray County seized several Mormon hostages from Caldwell County, and the subsequent attempt by the Mormons to rescue them.

Based on exaggerated reports of the battle and rumors of Mormon military plans, Boggs claimed that the Mormons had committed &quot;open and avowed defiance of the law&quot; and had &quot;made war upon the people of Missouri&quot;. Governor Boggs directed that &quot;the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace—their outrages are beyond all description&quot;.

The order was directed to General John Bullock Clark, and it was implemented by the state militia to forcefully displace the Mormons from Missouri. In response to the order, the Mormons surrendered and subsequently sought refuge in Nauvoo, Illinois. In 1976, citing its unconstitutional nature, Missouri Governor Kit Bond formally rescinded it. 
==Background==
The relationship between the Mormons and the state of Missouri had its roots in 1830, when a group of missionaries were sent to western Missouri with the goal of proselytizing among the Native Americans. This group arrived in Jackson County, Missouri, and initially encountered a welcoming response from some residents who were receptive to their message. In summer of 1831, Jackson County was designated as the place of Zion, a sacred site where Mormons believed they would eventually gather and prepare for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. However, as the number of Mormons in the area grew, tensions emerged between the Mormons and their non-Mormon neighbors. This was partly due to the religious and cultural differences between the two groups, economic competition, political differences, and fears of cultural displacement.
Tensions reached a boiling point in summer of 1833, when two newspaper articles discussing Missouri laws concerning slavery were published by the Mormon newspaper, &quot;the Evening and the Morning Star&quot; in Independence, Missouri. These articles were interpreted by Missourians as inviting free blacks to settle in the county. Residents of Jackson County, including several public officials, published a manifesto accusing the Mormons of having a &quot;corrupting influence&quot; on their slaves, and calling for their removal: &quot;peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must.&quot; On the same day, July 20, 1833, the W. W. Phelps printing press, which published the newspaper in Independence, was destroyed by a mob.

Mormons were given a county of their own —Caldwell County— in 1836, following their expulsion from Jackson County in 1833. However, the increasing influx of new converts moving to northwestern Missouri led them to begin settling in adjacent counties. Other settlers, who had operated under the assumption that Mormons would remain confined to Caldwell County, became angry due to these new settlements.

On July 4, 1838, First Presidency member Sidney Rigdon delivered an oration in Far West, the county seat of Caldwell County. Rigdon wanted to make clear that Mormons would meet any attacks on them with force. Far from settling tensions, Rigdon&#x27;s oration had the opposite effect: it terrified and inflamed the residents of surrounding counties. By the fall of that same year these tensions escalated into open conflict, culminating in the siege of the Mormon settlement in Carroll County, the sacking and burning of Gallatin by the Danites, and the taking of Mormon hostages by Captain Samuel Bogart and his state militia unit, operating in northern Ray County (to the south of Caldwell). 

A Mormon armed group from the town of Far West moved south to the militia camp on the Crooked River in order to rescue the hostages, causing rumors of a planned full-scale invasion of Missouri that ran rampant and aroused terror throughout the western part of the state. These rumors only increased as reports of the Battle of Crooked River reached the capital at Jefferson City, with exaggerated accounts of Mormons supposedly slaughtering Bogart&#x27;s militia company, including those who had surrendered. Further dispatches spoke of an impending attack on Richmond, county seat of Ray County, though in fact no such attack was ever contemplated.

Previously, Governor Boggs had received word that Mormons had driven several citizens of Daviess County (north of Caldwell) from their homes. He had then appointed General John Bullock Clark to lead the State Militia in assisting those citizens to return. But after hearing these reports, Governor Boggs issued new orders directing Clark to commence direct military operations and issued Missouri Executive Order 44.

==Enforcement==

General Clark cited Executive Order 44 soon after the Mormon settlers surrendered in November 1838, saying that violence would have been used had they chosen not to surrender. 
General Clark explicitly stated that the Mormons should expect no mercy and that their leaders would not be returned to them. Clark furthermore stated: 

Consequently, approximately 15,000 Mormons promptly fled to Illinois, enduring the harsh winter conditions. 

=== Deaths ===
While the term &quot;extermination&quot; was used in the order, Boggs would claim later in his life that his main desire was to subdue the Mormons without bloodshed. Historians Alexander L. Baugh and Steven LeSueur suggest the word &#x27;exterminate&#x27; reflects the historical usage of the term, which more broadly encompassed the expulsion or removal of a group or population from an area.

The question of whether anyone was directly killed as a result of the Extermination Order between its issuance on October 27, 1838, and the Mormon surrender on November 1, 1838, has been a subject of intense historical debate. The prevailing consensus among scholars is that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that militiamen invoked the order to justify their actions during that period. 
==== Haun&#x27;s Mill ====
The Haun&#x27;s Mill massacre took place on October 30, 1838, three days after the order. It was perpetrated by Missouri State Guardsmen from Livingston County on the settlement of Haun&#x27;s Mill, located in eastern Caldwell County near the Livingston County border. It resulted in the deaths of 18 people. While most scholars state there is little evidence that the militiamen knew of the Executive Order, there is at least one first-hand account claiming the perpetrators cited the governor&#x27;s ordering their extermination as the motive of the massacre.
=== Financial losses ===
To date, there have been no reparations or other financial compensation for losses by either side in the conflict. Historian William Alexander Linn wrote: 

==Aftermath==

Despite surrendering at Far West on November 1, Mormons (especially in outlying areas) continued to be subject to harassment by citizens and militia units. The Mormons in Caldwell County, as part of their surrender agreement, signed over all of their property to pay the expenses of the campaign against them; although this act was later held unlawful. 

Though Clark had offered to allow the Mormons to remain in Missouri until the following spring, they decided to leave right away; according to one account, most had departed within ten days of Clark&#x27;s speech. Although Governor Boggs belatedly ordered a militia unit under Colonel Sterling Price to northern Missouri to stop ongoing depredations against the Latter Day Saints, he refused to repeal the order. The Missouri legislature deferred discussion of an appeal by Mormons to rescind the decree.

Governor Boggs was excoriated in portions of the Missouri press, as well as those of neighboring states, for his action in issuing this order. General David Atchison, a legislator and militia general from western Missouri who had refused to take part in operations, demanded that the legislature formally state its opinion of Governor Boggs&#x27; order, for &quot;he would not live in any state, where such authority was given&quot;. Although his proposal and similar ones by others went down to defeat, Governor Boggs himself saw his once-promising political career destroyed to the point that, by the next election, his own party was reluctant to be associated with him. After surviving an assassination attempt in 1842, Governor Boggs ultimately emigrated to California, where he died in relative obscurity in the Napa Valley in 1860.

==Rescission==
In late 1975, President Lyman F. Edwards of the Far West stake of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, invited then Missouri Governor Kit Bond to participate in the June 25, 1976, annual stake conference as a good-will gesture for the United States Bicentennial. As part of his address at that conference, 137 years after being signed and citing the unconstitutional nature of Governor Boggs&#x27; directive, Governor Bond presented the following Executive Order:

<doc id="867671" wikidata="Q1539564" url="?curid=867671" title="Importance sampling">
<text>Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo method for evaluating properties of a particular distribution, while only having samples generated from a different distribution than the distribution of interest. Its introduction in statistics is generally attributed to a paper by Teun Kloek and Herman K. van Dijk in 1978, but its precursors can be found in statistical physics as early as 1949. Importance sampling is also related to umbrella sampling in computational physics. Depending on the application, the term may refer to the process of sampling from this alternative distribution, the process of inference, or both.

== Basic theory ==
Let formula_1 be a random variable in some probability space formula_2. We wish to estimate the expected value of formula_3 under formula_4, denoted formula_5. If we have statistically independent random samples formula_6, generated according to formula_7, then an empirical estimate of formula_8 is just

: formula_9

and the precision of this estimate depends on the variance of formula_3:

: formula_11

The basic idea of importance sampling is to sample from a different distribution to lower the variance of the estimation of formula_5, or when sampling directly from formula_4 is difficult.

This is accomplished by first choosing a random variable formula_14 such that formula_15 and that formula_4-almost everywhere formula_17.
With the variable formula_18 we define a probability formula_19 that satisfies
: formula_20

The variable formula_21 will thus be sampled under formula_19 to estimate formula_8 as above and this estimation is improved when
: formula_24

When formula_3 is of constant sign over formula_26, the best variable formula_18 would clearly be formula_28, so that formula_29 is the searched constant formula_8 and a single sample under formula_31 suffices to give its value. Unfortunately we cannot take that choice, because formula_8 is precisely the value we are looking for! However this theoretical best case formula_33 gives us an insight into what importance sampling does: for all formula_34, the density of formula_31 at formula_36 can be written as
: formula_37
To the right, formula_38 is one of the infinitesimal elements that sum up to formula_8:

: formula_40
therefore, a good probability change formula_19 in importance sampling will redistribute the law of formula_3 so that its samples&#x27; frequencies are sorted directly according to their weights in formula_8. Hence the name &quot;importance sampling.&quot;

Importance sampling is often used as a Monte Carlo integrator.
When formula_4 is the uniform distribution over formula_45, the expectation formula_8 corresponds to the integral of the real function formula_47.
== Application to probabilistic inference ==

Such methods are frequently used to estimate posterior densities or expectations in state and/or parameter estimation problems in probabilistic models that are too hard to treat analytically. Examples include Bayesian networks and importance weighted variational autoencoders.

== Application to simulation ==
Importance sampling is a variance reduction technique that can be used in the Monte Carlo method. The idea behind importance sampling is that certain values of the input random variables in a simulation have more impact on the parameter being estimated than others. If these &quot;important&quot; values are emphasized by sampling more frequently, then the estimator variance can be reduced. Hence, the basic methodology in importance sampling is to choose a distribution which &quot;encourages&quot; the important values. This use of &quot;biased&quot; distributions will result in a biased estimator if it is applied directly in the simulation. However, the simulation outputs are weighted to correct for the use of the biased distribution, and this ensures that the new importance sampling estimator is unbiased. The weight is given by the likelihood ratio, that is, the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the true underlying distribution with respect to the biased simulation distribution.

The fundamental issue in implementing importance sampling simulation is the choice of the biased distribution which encourages the important regions of the input variables. Choosing or designing a good biased distribution is the &quot;art&quot; of importance sampling. The rewards for a good distribution can be huge run-time savings; the penalty for a bad distribution can be longer run times than for a general Monte Carlo simulation without importance sampling.

Consider formula_3 to be the sample and formula_49 to be the likelihood ratio, where formula_50 is the probability density (mass) function of the desired distribution and formula_51 is the probability density (mass) function of the biased/proposal/sample distribution. Then the problem can be characterized by choosing the sample distribution formula_51 that minimizes the variance of the scaled sample:

:formula_53

It can be shown that the following distribution minimizes the above variance:

:formula_54

Notice that when formula_55, this variance becomes 0.

=== Mathematical approach ===

Consider estimating by simulation the probability formula_56 of an event formula_57, where formula_3 is a random variable with cumulative distribution function formula_59 and probability density function formula_60, where prime denotes derivative. A formula_61-length independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence formula_62 is generated from the distribution formula_63, and the number formula_64 of random variables that lie above the threshold formula_65 are counted. The random variable formula_64 is characterized by the Binomial distribution

:formula_67

One can show that formula_68, and formula_69, so in the limit formula_70 we are able to obtain formula_71. Note that the variance is low if formula_72. Importance sampling is concerned with the determination and use of an alternate density function formula_73(for formula_3), usually referred to as a biasing density, for the simulation experiment. This density allows the event formula_75 to occur more frequently, so the sequence lengths formula_61 gets smaller for a given estimator variance. Alternatively, for a given formula_61, use of the biasing density results in a variance smaller than that of the conventional Monte Carlo estimate. From the definition of formula_56, we can introduce formula_73 as below.

:formula_80

where

:formula_81

is a likelihood ratio and is referred to as the weighting function. The last equality in the above equation motivates the estimator

:formula_82

This is the importance sampling estimator of formula_56 and is unbiased. That is, the estimation procedure is to generate i.i.d. samples from formula_73 and for each sample which exceeds formula_85, the estimate is incremented by the weight formula_86 evaluated at the sample value. The results are averaged over formula_87 trials. The variance of the importance sampling estimator is easily shown to be

:formula_88

Now, the importance sampling problem then focuses on finding a biasing density formula_73 such that the variance of the importance sampling estimator is less than the variance of the general Monte Carlo estimate. For some biasing density function, which minimizes the variance, and under certain conditions reduces it to zero, it is called an optimal biasing density function.

=== Conventional biasing methods ===

Although there are many kinds of biasing methods, the following two methods are most widely used in the applications of importance sampling.

==== Scaling ====

Shifting probability mass into the event region formula_75 by positive scaling of the random variable formula_91 with a number greater than unity has the effect of increasing the variance (mean also) of the density function. This results in a heavier tail of the density, leading to an increase in the event probability. Scaling is probably one of the earliest biasing methods known and has been extensively used in practice. It is simple to implement and usually provides conservative simulation gains as compared to other methods.

In importance sampling by scaling, the simulation density is chosen as the density function of the scaled random variable formula_92, where usually formula_93 for tail probability estimation. By transformation,

:formula_94

and the weighting function is

:formula_95

While scaling shifts probability mass into the desired event region, it also pushes mass into the complementary region formula_96 which is undesirable. If formula_91 is a sum of formula_98 random variables, the spreading of mass takes place in an formula_98 dimensional space. The consequence of this is a decreasing importance sampling gain for increasing formula_98, and is called the dimensionality effect.
A modern version of importance sampling by scaling is e.g. so-called sigma-scaled sampling (SSS) which is running multiple Monte Carlo (MC) analysis with different scaling factors. In opposite to many other high yield estimation methods (like worst-case distances WCD) SSS does not suffer much from the dimensionality problem. Also addressing multiple MC outputs causes no degradation in efficiency. On the other hand, as WCD, SSS is only designed for Gaussian statistical variables, and in opposite to WCD, the SSS method is not designed to provide accurate statistical corners. Another SSS disadvantage is that the MC runs with large scale factors may become difficult, e. g. due to model and simulator convergence problems. In addition, in SSS we face a strong bias-variance trade-off: Using large scale factors, we obtain quite stable yield results, but the larger the scale factors, the larger the bias error. If the advantages of SSS does not matter much in the application of interest, then often other methods are more efficient.

==== Translation ====

Another simple and effective biasing technique employs translation of the density function (and hence random variable) to place much of its probability mass in the rare event region. Translation does not suffer from a dimensionality effect and has been successfully used in several applications relating to simulation of digital communication systems. It often provides better simulation gains than scaling. In biasing by translation, the simulation density is given by

:formula_101

where formula_102 is the amount of shift and is to be chosen to minimize the variance of the importance sampling estimator.

=== Effects of system complexity ===

The fundamental problem with importance sampling is that designing good biased distributions becomes more complicated as the system complexity increases. Complex systems are the systems with long memory since complex processing of a few inputs is much easier to handle. This dimensionality or memory can cause problems in three ways:

* long memory (severe intersymbol interference (ISI))
* unknown memory (Viterbi decoders)
* possibly infinite memory (adaptive equalizers)

In principle, the importance sampling ideas remain the same in these situations, but the design becomes much harder. A successful approach to combat this problem is essentially breaking down a simulation into several smaller, more sharply defined subproblems. Then importance sampling strategies are used to target each of the simpler subproblems. Examples of techniques to break the simulation down are conditioning and error-event simulation (EES) and regenerative simulation.

=== Evaluation of importance sampling ===

In order to identify successful importance sampling techniques, it is useful to be able to quantify the run-time savings due to the use of the importance sampling approach. The performance measure commonly used is formula_103, and this can be interpreted as the speed-up factor by which the importance sampling estimator achieves the same precision as the MC estimator. This has to be computed empirically since the estimator variances are not likely to be analytically possible when their mean is intractable. Other useful concepts in quantifying an importance sampling estimator are the variance bounds and the notion of asymptotic efficiency. One related measure is the so-called Effective Sample Size (ESS).

=== Variance cost function ===

Variance is not the only possible cost function for a simulation, and other cost functions, such as the mean absolute deviation, are used in various statistical applications. Nevertheless, the variance is the primary cost function addressed in the literature, probably due to the use of variances in confidence intervals and in the performance measure formula_103.

An associated issue is the fact that the ratio formula_103 overestimates the run-time savings due to importance sampling since it does not include the extra computing time required to compute the weight function. Hence, some people evaluate the net run-time improvement by various means. Perhaps a more serious overhead to importance sampling is the time taken to devise and program the technique and analytically derive the desired weight function.

===Multiple and adaptive importance sampling ===
When different proposal distributions, formula_106 , formula_107 are jointly used for drawing the samples formula_108 different proper weighting functions can be employed (e.g., see ). In an adaptive setting, the proposal distributions, formula_109 , formula_107 and formula_111 are updated each iteration formula_65 of the adaptive importance sampling algorithm. Hence, since a population of proposal densities is used, several suitable combinations of sampling and weighting schemes can be employed.

<text>Burgundy Diamond Mines Limited is an end-to-end global diamond company that delivers gem-quality diamonds from its cornerstone asset Ekati Diamond Mine through rough sales to its polished and cut diamond sales office in Perth, Australia. Burgundy is publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX:BDM) and is the parent company of Arctic Canadian Diamond Company Limited. The company sources its gem-quality diamonds from the Ekati Diamond Mine, located in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The company has a corporate office in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, a rough diamond sales office in Antwerp, Belgium, and a cut and polishing facility in Perth, Australia.

==History==
Burgundy Diamond Mines Limited was initially known as EHR Resources Limited, an exploration company focused on a single gold and silver project, and publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX:EHX) since January 3, 2013.

On November 20, 2020, EHR Resources changed its name to Burgundy Diamond Mines to reflect the company’s transition into a developer of diamond projects with investments into the Naujaat Diamond Project in Canada’s Northwest Territories and the Botswana Exploration Alliance.  

On March 24, 2021, Burgundy Diamond Mines signed an option deed with Glibb River Diamonds Ltd. (ASX:GLB) to acquire 100% ownership of the Ellendale Diamond Project and Blina projects in the West Kimberly region of Australia. The company decided not to exercise the option to acquire the Ellendale Diamond Project on March 20, 2023.  

In July 2022, Burgundy launched its luxury diamond brand Maison Mazerea.

On March 14, 2023, Burgundy announced that it had entered into a share purchase agreement with the Arctic Canadian Diamond companies (Arctic Canadian Diamond Holding LLC to acquire 100 percent of the issued capital in Arctic Canadian Diamond Company Ltd. and Arctic Canadian Diamond Marketing N.V.). The transaction closed in July 2023, making Burgundy Diamond Mines a fully-integrated, global-scale company that has the ability to trace the full chain of custody of high-quality sourced diamonds from Ekati Diamond Mine in Canada directly to its customers. 

In September 2024, Burgundy paused its plans to develop an underground project at one of the Ekati diamond mine&#x27;s pits. Also in September the company called for reduced regulations in the region. Some of their requests to the NWT include lowering the amount of money the mine must set aside for reclamation costs and a guarantee that Ekati&#x27;s impact benefit agreements will be grandfathered in when the Mineral Resources Act is revised, which would help Burgundy avoid any new requirements to pay Indigenous groups impacted by the mine.

<text>The Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences (commonly referred to as Seattle Academy or SAAS) is a co-ed private middle and high school located on Seattle, Washington&#x27;s urban Capitol Hill.

As of 2020, school review website Niche ranks Seattle Academy as the seventh best private high school, ninth best college prep private high school, and fifty-eighth most diverse private high school in Washington state.

== History ==
Seattle Academy was founded by Jean Orvis in 1983, who served as head of school until the 2008-2009 school year. From 2009 to June 2018 the head of school was Joe Puggelli, who previously had a long and varied career, including US Army service, publishing, education, and coaching. In July 2018 long-tenured faculty, staff, and coach Rob Phillips became Seattle Academy&#x27;s Head of School.

The school has a 21-member board, which consists of current parents, alumni parents and alumni of the school. The chair is David Sheppard.

The school has 1,069 students. Annual tuition is $43,692 during the 2023–2024 school year. The school consists of grades 6–12.

In 2017, the institution broke ground on a $48 million, five-story middle school building located at the intersection of 13th Avenue and Union Street.

SAAS consists of six main buildings: the Temple building (the school still shares the same building with the Temple De Hirsch-Sinai), which houses the Upper School Humanities Department; the Vanderbilt Building, the Arts Center, which houses math and art classes; the Gym, complete with a weight room, multiple exercise machines, and a basketball court (SAAS&#x27;s gym is one of the largest school-owned gyms in the Seattle area); the STREAM Building, a Gold LEED certified facility dedicated to the Upper School Science curriculum; and the Middle School Building, a five-story middle school building which opened in Fall 2018, which is also LEED-certified and targeting LEED Gold.

== Technology ==
Seattle Academy has a technology program which includes full-time tech support staff, a fully wireless campus, and mandatory laptops provided for all Upper School students. The middle school has a full computer lab and a number of laptop banks.

== Student life ==

Seattle Academy has many student-run clubs and academic teams facilitated by faculty members. Notable teams include:
* Youth Legislature - multiple state officers elected
* Speech and Debate - Speech team is often State Champions; both compete at the national level
* Mock Trial - Outstanding Attorney and Witness awards won yearly
* Robotics - Won multiple awards at every level, including at the World Championships in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

<text>The Battle of Talavera (27–28 July 1809) was fought just outside the town of Talavera de la Reina, Spain some southwest of Madrid, during the Peninsular War. At Talavera, a British army under Sir Arthur Wellesley combined with a Spanish army under General Cuesta fought in operations against French-occupied Madrid. At nightfall, the French army withdrew a short distance after several of its attacks had been repulsed; the allies, having suffered comparable casualties to the French, made no attempt to pursue.

After Marshal Soult&#x27;s French army had retreated from Portugal, General Wellesley&#x27;s 20,000 British troops advanced into Spain to join 33,000 Spanish troops under General Cuesta. They marched up the Tagus valley to Talavera, some southwest of Madrid. There they encountered 46,000 French under Marshal Claude Victor and Major-General Horace Sébastiani, with the French king of Spain, Joseph Bonaparte in nominal command.

The French crossed the Alberche in the middle of the afternoon on 27July. A few hours later, the French attacked the right of the Spaniards and the British left. A strategic hill was taken and lost, until, finally, the British held it firmly. At daybreak on 28July, the French attacked the British left again to retake the hill and were repulsed when the 29th Foot and 48th Foot who had been lying behind the crest stood up and carried out a bayonet charge. A French cannonade lasted until noon, when a negotiated armistice of two hours began. That afternoon, a heavy exchange of cannon fire started ahead of various infantry and cavalry skirmishes. Early in the evening, a major engagement resulted in the French being held off. A cannon duel continued until dark. At daylight, the British and Spanish discovered that the bulk of the French force had retired, leaving their wounded and two brigades of artillery in the field. Wellesley was ennobled as Viscount Wellington of Talavera and of Wellington for the action.

==Background==
The Spanish campaign in late 1809 started with the battle of Talavera.

==Preliminary movements==
On 27 July, Wellesley sent out the 3rd Division and some cavalry under the command of George Anson to cover Cuesta&#x27;s retreat into the Talavera position. But when Anson&#x27;s cavalry mistakenly pulled back, the French rushed in to surprise and inflict over 400 casualties on Rufane Donkin&#x27;s brigade, forcing them to fall back. That night, Victor sent Ruffin&#x27;s division to seize the hill known as Cerro de Medellín in a &quot;coup de main&quot;. Two of Ruffin&#x27;s three regiments went astray in the dark, but the 9th Light Infantry routed Sigismund von Löw&#x27;s King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL) brigade (1st Division) and pushed forward to capture the high ground. Alertly, Hill sent Richard Stewart&#x27;s brigade (2nd Division) on a counter-attack which drove the French away. The British suffered some 800 casualties on the 27th.

During the evening of 27th, French dragoon squadrons were riding close to the Spanish position firing their carbines at Spanish skirmishers. Suddenly, without orders, Cuesta&#x27;s entire Spanish line fired a thunderous at the French dragoons. The French were outside the range of the Spanish muskets, and little harm was done to them. Four Spanish battalions threw down their weapons and fled in panic. Wellesley wrote, &quot;Nearly 2,000 ran off on the evening of the 27th...(not 100 yards from where I was standing) who were neither attacked, nor threatened with an attack, and who were frightened by the noise of their own fire; they left their arms and accoutrements on the ground, their officers went with them, and they... plundered the baggage of the British army which had been sent to the rear.&quot; While a majority of the panicked troops were brought back, many hundreds continued to flee, taking some rear echelon British with them.

==Opposing armies==
===Allied army===

Wellesley&#x27;s British army consisted of four infantry divisions, three cavalry brigades and 30 cannon, totaling 20,641 troops. The infantry included the 1st Division under John Coape Sherbrooke (6,000), the 2nd Division led by Rowland Hill (3,900), the 3rd Division commanded by Alexander Mackenzie (3,700) and the 4th Division (3,000) under Alexander Campbell. Henry Fane led a brigade of heavy cavalry (1,100), while Stapleton Cotton (1,000) and George Anson (900) commanded light cavalry brigades. There were three British (RA: Lawson&#x27;s Company, Sillery&#x27;s Company, Elliot&#x27;s Company) and two KGL batteries (Rettberg, Heise) with six guns apiece.

Cuesta&#x27;s Spanish army of 35,000 was organized into five infantry and two cavalry divisions, plus about 30 artillery pieces, some 12 lb guns. The 28,000 infantry were in Zayas y Chacón&#x27;s 1st Division (7 battalions) and Vanguard (5 battalions), Iglesias&#x27;s 2nd Division (8 battalions), Portago&#x27;s 3rd Division (6 battalions), Manglano&#x27;s 4th Division (8 battalions) and Bassecourt&#x27;s 5th Division (7 battalions). Henestrosa and the Duke of Alburquerque led the 6,000 horsemen of the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and there were 800 artillerymen.

===French Army===
While Joseph nominally led the French Army, his military adviser Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan actually exercised command over their 37,700 infantry and artillerymen, 8,400 cavalry and about 80 cannon.

Victor&#x27;s I Corps included the infantry divisions of François Amable Ruffin (5,300), Pierre Belon Lapisse (6,900) and Eugene-Casimir Villatte (6,100), plus Louis-Chrétien Carrière, Baron de Beaumont&#x27;s 1,000-man light cavalry brigade.

Sébastiani&#x27;s IV Corps consisted of his own infantry division (8,100), Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence&#x27;s Poles (1,600) and Jean François Leval with his German-Dutch division (4,500). Christophe Antoine Merlin led the IV Corps light cavalry brigade (1,200).

Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg (3,300) and Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud (2,350) commanded the two heavy dragoon divisions of the Cavalry Reserve.

The Madrid Garrison included part of Jean-Joseph, Marquis Dessolles&#x27;s division (3,300), the King&#x27;s Spanish Foot Guards (1,800) and two regiments of cavalry (700).

==Positions==
In the morning, it could be seen that the bulk of Cuesta&#x27;s army held the right while the British formed the left. The Spanish right was anchored on the city of Talavera on the Tagus River and followed the course of the Portina stream. In the centre the British had built a redoubt, which was backed by the 4th Division and in which they placed a battery of four 3lb light cannons. Further to the left, the Medellín hill was held by the 1st Division, with the 2nd Division to its left. The 3rd Division plus Fane&#x27;s and Cotton&#x27;s cavalry formed the reserve. On the far left, Bassecourt&#x27;s Spanish division was positioned on some high ground near the Sierra de Segurilla. Anson&#x27;s brigade covered the valley between the Medellín and the Segurilla, supported by Alburquerque&#x27;s Spanish horsemen.

Joseph and Jourdan massed Victor&#x27;s I Corps on the French right, holding the hill of Cerro de Cascajal. Sébastiani&#x27;s corps held the centre, while Latour-Maubourg and the Madrid garrison stood in reserve. On the French left, Milhaud&#x27;s horsemen faced almost the entire Spanish army. Opposite the Medellín, the Cascajal bristled with 30 French cannon.

==Battle==

Victor urged his superiors for a massive attack, but Joseph and Jourdan chose to peck away at the Anglo-Spanish position. At dawn, the guns on the Cascajal opened up, causing some loss among the British infantry formed in the open. Having learned the hard way about the destructive power of French artillery, Wellesley soon pulled his soldiers back into cover.

Again, Ruffin&#x27;s division attacked the Medellín. Each battalion was formed in a column of divisions with a width of two companies and a depth of three. (French battalions had recently been re-organized into six companies.) Each regiment&#x27;s three battalions advanced side by side with only a small gap between units. This would make each regimental attack roughly 160 files across and nine ranks deep. When Ruffin&#x27;s men got within effective range, the British emerged from cover in two-deep lines to overlap the French columns. Riddled by fire from front and flank, and with their rear six ranks unable to fire, the French columns broke and ran.

Victor shifted Ruffin&#x27;s survivors to the right against the Segurilla and supported them with one of Villatte&#x27;s brigades. Lapisse, Sébastiani and Leval (from right to left) then launched a frontal attack against the British 1st and 4th Divisions. Alexander Campbell&#x27;s men and the Spanish (notably the Cavalry Regiment El Rey) met Leval&#x27;s attack, which went in first. Lapisse and Sébastiani then advanced in two lines using the same regimental columns that Ruffin had employed. Henry Campbell&#x27;s Guards brigade (1st Division) routed the French regiments opposite them, then charged in pursuit, running into the French second line and intense artillery fire. The Guards and the Germans with them were routed in their turn, losing 500 men, including Major General Heinrich von Porbeck, and carried away Cameron&#x27;s brigade with them. Seeing Guards and his centre broken, Wellesley personally brought up the 48th Foot to plug the hole caused by the dispersal of Sherbrooke&#x27;s division. Backed by Mackenzie&#x27;s brigade (3rd Division), the 48th broke the French second line&#x27;s attack as the Guards rallied in the rear. Lapisse was mortally wounded.

The main French attack having been defeated, Victor pushed Ruffin&#x27;s men into the valley between the Medellín and the Segurilla. Anson&#x27;s cavalry brigade was ordered to drive them back. While the 1st KGL Hussars advanced at a controlled pace, the 23rd Light Dragoons soon broke into a wild gallop. The undisciplined unit ran into a hidden ravine, hobbling many horses. Those horsemen who cleared the obstacle were easily fended off by the French infantry, formed into squares. The 23rd Light Dragoons charged past the squares and ploughed into Beaumont&#x27;s cavalry, drawn up behind Ruffin. The British dragoons lost 102 killed and wounded and another 105 captured before they cut their way out. After the battle, the mauled regiment had to be sent back to England to refit. However, this ended the French attacks for the day. Joseph and Jourdan failed to employ their reserve, for which they were bitterly criticized by Napoleon.

==Aftermath==
The Spanish campaign in late 1809 proceeded with the Talavera campaign in the Battle of Almonacid.

===Talavera===
The French, in this hard-fought set-piece battle, lost 7,389: 944 killed, 6,294 wounded, 156 prisoners and 17 guns captured. The Allies lost more: 7,468. The Spanish casualties were about 1,200 and British casualties were 6,268, including 800 killed, over the two days of fighting. This was approximately 25% of the British force, compared to only 18% of the French, although it is clear that the brunt of the French attack fell on the British. Many of the wounded on both sides were burnt to death when the dry grass of the battlefield caught fire, as Lieutenant-General John Elley wrote to his sister: &quot;[...] the ground on which the battle was fought was clothed with corn, long grass and heath. The fire of the artillery was excessive and set fire to the corn and grass, the consequence was a number of the wounded were literally roasted alive. The enemy abandoned great numbers of their wounded, which together with our own we have been collecting [...]&quot;The next day, the 3,000 infantry of the Light Division reinforced the British army after completing a famous march of in 26 hours.

Meanwhile, Marshal Soult advanced south, threatening to cut Wellesley off from Portugal. Thinking that the French force was only 15,000 strong, Wellesley moved east on 3 August to block it, leaving 1,500 wounded in the care of the Spanish. Spanish guerillas captured a message from Soult to Joseph that Soult had 30,000 men and brought it to Wellesley. The British commander, realising his line of retreat was about to be cut by a larger French force, sent the Light Brigade on a mad dash for the bridge over the Tagus River at Almaraz. The light infantry reached there on 6 August, just ahead of Soult. By 20 August, all British forces had withdrawn across the mountains and for the next six months, until 27 February 1810, Wellesley&#x27;s forces took no part in the hard fighting in southern Spain and along the Portuguese border, despite numerous invitations from the Spanish. The Spanish had also promised food to the British if they advanced back into Spain, but Wellington, with an army incapable of living off the land like the French and without its own transport, did not trust his ally to provide these essentials and made general excuses blaming the Spanish for various deficiencies of their government and army. In the event of the retreat the British abandoned nearly all of their baggage and ammunition as well as the artillery captured from the French at Talavera.

The Spanish made another attempt to take Madrid, with Wellesley still refusing to participate, and they were ultimately badly defeated at the battle of Ocaña in November 1809.

Historian Charles Oman, in volume II of &quot;A History of the Peninsular War&quot;, calls the Talavera campaign a failure for the Anglo-Spanish allies, placing the blame on various Spanish errors while dismissing much of the criticism of Wellesley and the British, suggesting there was no reason to imagine a concentration of the French forces opposing them. Oman also attributes some of the failure to Wellesley&#x27;s ignorance of the conditions in Spain at the time. At the start of the campaign Wellington had received the promised provisions while both the French and the Spanish were suffering severe shortages of food. He complained more about the failure of the Spanish to provide transport for the provisions than food attributing this to maliciousness on the part of the Spanish, apparently unaware that there was no transport to be had for any army in that area.

After this battle Wellesley was created Viscount Wellington of Talavera.

==Popular culture==
The same year Irish politician and writer John Wilson Croker&#x27;s poem &quot;The Battles of Talavera&quot; was published. A popular success, running through several editions, it played a major role in romanticising the Peninsular War.

Talavera is the setting for &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Eagle&quot;, the first book written in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;Sharpe&quot; series, and is depicted in the conclusion of the film adaptation of the same name. The flanking manoeuvre by the Light Company is completely fictional as is the South Essex regiment they are attached to. Cavalry is notably absent from the battle, with the hidden ditch used by Sharpe and his men for cover instead.

The &quot;Monument to the Battle of Talavera&quot;, a war memorial located in Talavera de la Reina, was inaugurated on 2 October 1990.

<text>Cock E.S.P. is a band based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The group draws on extreme, subversive and absurdist elements of popular and experimental twentieth century music and performance art.

==History==
Although the group has dabbled in various musical styles and techniques over the years, the most recent has involved the showcasing and amplifying of mistakes and equipment failures. E.S.P. began to feel that such unintended sounds actually had a greater capacity for chaos and intensity than those sounds they actually wished to create. Thus, recent studio recordings were edited to isolate and emphasize these sounds, creating an intricate web of pure noise. 

The group&#x27;s live performance has changed over the years, starting out as a standard recital of the recorded music, and eventually ending up as a drunken absurdist theatrical production utilizing homemade costumes, props and elaborate stage lighting set-ups; combining the elements of MTV’s &quot;Jackass&quot; with a literally crippling level of ineptitude. On a recent 2011 tour the group introduced an all wireless setup which allow not only greater freedom-of-movement but created another level of uncertainty with all manor of radio stations, shortwave, CB and other unintended electronic interference to play a role, including bizarre interactions between E.S.P. performers&#x27; signals.

Cock E.S.P. is often noted for injecting comedic and absurdist elements into their; the result of an ever-increasing level of hard work and professionalism. Despite releasing dozens of lo-fidelity demo cassettes in their early days that tend to consist of long, utterly lazy-sounding static tracks of heavily distorted low- to mid-range noise that sound like no one was paying any attention to any aspect of them, the group now embraces production values.

The roots of ESP date back to 1984, when founding member P.C. Hammeroids organized a metal-percussion noise ensemble called Grandpa Eats Goat Cheese. Over the next nine years, Hammeroids recorded and performed under several names, adding more and more electronic noise to the mix. In 1993 Hammeroids joined forces with Emil Hagstrom (of Wrong), beginning the project which would soon become known as Cock E.S.P. The name of the group appears to have been derived from one of the track titles of an album by the Japanese noise band Hanatarash.

Hammeroids retired in 1996 and was replaced later that year by Matt Bacon. Elyse Perez (Laundry Room Squelchers) became the permanent third member in 2001. Guest members over the years have included Weasel Walter (Flying Luttenbachers, XBXRX), Rat Bastard (Laundryroom Squelchers, Scraping Teeth), Misty Martinez, La Persona (BunnyBrains, U Can Unlearn Guitar), Paige Flash, John Vance (Wrong, Rexor), and Kazko Peasmith (Insect Deli, Winter Carousel).

Cock E.S.P. has given more than 150 performances throughout the US and Europe in various rock and jazz clubs, punk houses, theatres, festival stages, art galleries, record stores and warehouse performance spaces. The group has collaborated with such artists as Thurston Moore, Merzbow, The Eugenics Council, and Aube; has played shows with such artists as Sonic Youth, Wolf Eyes, Hair Police, Borbetomagus, Stereolab, Impaler, Melt-Banana, Caroliner Rainbow, BunnyBrains, Illusion of Safety, Sudden Infant, V/Vm and the Nihilist Spasm Band; and has appeared on compilation releases with such artists as Andrew W.K., Derek Bailey, the Haters, Bruce Gilbert, Today is the Day, Reynols, Harvey Sid Fisher, Bomb20, Jansky Noise, Quintron, The Locust, His Name Is Alive, Jad Fair, John Oswald, Masonna, Hijo Kaidan, Lasse Marhaug and Free Kitten. 

The group celebrated their 10th anniversary in autumn 2003 by releasing their second greatest hits collection, a remix CD, their first DVD, and by doing a three-week US tour. In early 2004 they released their third collection of greatest hits, and did a short tour featuring the &quot;classic&quot; Bacon/Hagstrom duo line-up. 

In addition to Cock E.S.P., members have played in a variety of intriguing side-projects. Matt Bacon has been a drummer, bassist and vocalist with a number of punk, metal and industrial bands including Zenith Flytrap, the Derks, Sauce Party and Broke Box (which was once described by Peter Sotos of Whitehouse as being &quot;Great!&quot;) Emil Hagstrom is also a member of the free-improv ensemble WRONG, and the dark electro-acoustic project Origami Genitalia. Elyse Perez performs no wave and punk with such bands as the Real Band and Fancy &amp; Stink.

In 2004, Cock E.S.P. released an album jointly with Panicsville, &quot;Last Train to Cocksville&quot;, a &#x27;tribute&#x27; to The Monkees.

<doc id="867703" wikidata="Q7104497" url="?curid=867703" title="Orthodox Study Bible">
<text>The Orthodox Study Bible (OSB) is an Eastern Orthodox study Bible published by Thomas Nelson in 2008. It uses an English translation of the Septuagint by St. Athanasius Academy for the Old Testament and the New King James Version for the New Testament.

==Translation==
The original edition of the OSB, released in 1993, included only the New Testament and Psalms, both NKJV. Priest Seraphim Johnson criticized the use of the NKJV translation, particularly for the Psalms. The 1993 edition was also criticized by Archimandrite Ephrem for its commentary feeling more evangelical than Orthodox. The NKJV text of the Psalms was replaced in the 2008 edition by the Psalms of the new OSB translation of the Old Testament.

The 2008 OSB&#x27;s Old Testament is a translation of the Septuagint developed by St. Athanasius Academy of Orthodox Theology. The translation is based upon the Alfred Rahlfs&#x27; edition of the Septuagint using the NKJV as the base text, being altered where different from the Septuagint, and the Brenton edition as additional reference material. The 2008 OSB&#x27;s New Testament is the NKJV, which translates the Greek &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; used by the Eastern Orthodox Church. The overview committee included fourteen archbishops, metropolitans, and bishops from various Orthodox jurisdictions, as well as eight priests and seven lay scholars.

==Study materials==
The translations of the Old Testament and New Testament are accompanied by commentary from the Orthodox viewpoint. Articles provide guidance and support for many facets of the Orthodox faith which can be confusing or unknown to those unacquainted with the Church. There is a comparative of list of contents, side-by-side with the Roman Catholic canon and the generally accepted Protestant canon. The OSB addresses such questions as: Why is the Mother of God essential to the Faith? Who were the Seventy Disciples? How is an Orthodox understanding of the Bible different from a Roman Catholic or Protestant understanding? In addition, the OSB provides basic daily prayers, a lectionary for personal use, and reproductions of icons in its pages.

==Response==
Although not an official text of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the publication has received positive endorsements from such prominent bishops as Metropolitan Maximos of Pittsburgh (Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America), Metropolitan Phillip (Antiochian Orthodox Church) and Metropolitan Theodosius (Orthodox Church in America).

Its combined networks constitute approximately 13,100 km of natural gas pipelines connecting more than 650,000 customers ... ATCO Australia also includes ATCO Power Australia, which has three power stations operating in Brisbane, Adelaide and Karratha. In January 2011, these plants were transferred from ATCO Power, based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, which operates 15 power generating facilities in Canada and the United Kingdom. While not part of ATCO Australia, ATCO Structures &amp; Logistics is an important part of ATCO&#x27;s Australian operations with three manufacturing facilities and five office locations in the country.&#x27;

== History ==
ATCO was founded in 1947, by S. Don Southern who gave a minority stake to his son Ron Southern, under the name Alberta Trailer Hire, renting fifteen utility trailers in the Calgary area. As the company&#x27;s operations grew, they also began to sell trailers, first becoming the Alberta Trailer Company, then ATCO. By the early 1960s, the company had operations across North America and in Australia.

ATCO Industries Ltd. became a public company in March 1968, with shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. During the 1970s, the company expanded into the natural gas and petroleum industries, and into the electricity industry in the 1980s.

In 2004, with the deregulation of the retail energy industry in Alberta, ATCO sold the retail operations of ATCO Gas and ATCO Electric to Direct Energy Marketing Ltd. (DEML) while ATCO Gas and ATCO Electric still operated as &quot;distributors&quot; (owning and operating the infrastructure that delivers natural gas or electricity in its service territories). As part of the sale to DEML, DEML contracted call center and billing services from ATCO I-Tek. In 2016, ATCO re-entered the retail energy industry in Alberta as ATCOenergy.

In 2018, ATCO acquired 40% of the shares in Neltume Ports, a South American port terminal operator.

In 2022, ATCO agreed to pay a fine after overcharging for work on a new transmission line.

<text>The Canadian and American Reformed Churches (CanRC) is a federation of Protestant Reformed (Calvinist) churches in Canada and the United States, with historical roots in the Reformed Churches of the Netherlands.

CanRC emphasizes the importance of adherence to Biblical, covenantal, redemptive-historical preaching within the Reformed Christian tradition, as well as sanctification.

==Basic beliefs and doctrine==
CanRC churches believe in the full sovereignty of God and in Biblical infallibility. The basis of the preaching and teaching in these churches is the belief that Jesus Christ is both truly God and truly human, and is the long-awaited Messiah who suffered and died for the sins of God&#x27;s people, and that this demands a thankful response of faith and obedience. Like many other Reformed churches, they teach that salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone. They broadly follow Calvinist theology, and have adopted the Three Forms of Unity, a common Calvinist doctrine.

When a member of the church public states their faith in Jesus, they are understood to subscribe to the confessions of the church as faithfully summarizing the doctrine of the Bible. Profession of faith also confirms their status as communicant members, subject to a process of church discipline, up to and including excommunication if they are considered delinquent in doctrine or lifestyle. This is ascertained by other members and by the elders through yearly home visits.

==History==
CanRC was founded by members of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated) (GKV) who immigrated to Canada following World War II. These Dutch immigrants first made contact with already-existing Reformed churches in Canada, especially the Protestant Reformed Churches in America (PRC) and the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA), in the hope that they could join with them. This was deemed impossible due to theological differences with the PRC, and the CRCNA&#x27;s sympathy with the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, which had expelled the GKV in 1944 over a disagreement regarding Abraham Kuyper&#x27;s view of the covenant.

The Canadian Reformed Churches maintained ecumenical relations with the GKV until tension between the two churches led to an official termination of their relationship by the General Synod of the Canadian Reformed Churches in 2019. Reasons for this decision included disapproval of the GKV&#x27;s hermeneutics, as well as the GKV&#x27;s more accepting views regarding women in office, common law couples, and homosexual members.

The first Canadian Reformed congregation was instituted in Lethbridge, Alberta, on April 16, 1950. The same year, churches were instituted in Edmonton and Neerlandia, Alberta; Orangeville, Ontario; and New Westminster, British Columbia. As of 2023, there are 70 congregations, which can be found in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario, as well as in the American states of Washington, Michigan and Colorado.

== Church government ==
Under the assertion that the government of the church must be regulated by the Bible, the Canadian Reformed Churches practice what they call a traditionally Reformed &quot;bottom-up&quot; polity, as opposed to a &quot;top-down&quot; model of church government. This approach to church polity reflects their European Reformed roots and it is used to be both anti-hierarchical and anti-independent, promoting both the autonomy of the local church and the need to cooperate within a federation.

Only male members who have made profession of faith and meet the conditions as set forth in certain Biblical passages (such as 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1) are eligible for office as pastors, elders, and deacons. Women are not eligible for office.

The government of the Canadian Reformed Churches is based on the Church Order adopted by the Synod of Dort (1618–1619). The Canadian Reformed Churches have revised the Church Order to reflect changed circumstances, and to incorporate minor improvements. The revised Church Order follows the principles and structure of the Church Order of Dort.

The Church Order contains 76 Articles which are divided into four sections dealing with:

* the offices and supervision of doctrine (ministers, missionaries, elders, deacons)
* the assemblies of the church (consistory, classis, regional synod, general synod)
* the liturgy of the church (worship services, sacraments, ceremonies)
* the discipline of the church

The federation is divided first by local consistories, then into eight classical regions, next with two annual regional synods, and finally a general synod. General synod takes place every three years.

== Missions ==

=== Foreign missions ===
All of the churches are also involved, either directly or indirectly, in the work of foreign mission. The Cornerstone Church of Hamilton, Ontario has sent a missionary working in northern Brazil. The church of Aldergrove, British Columbia, has sent two missionaries working in northern Brazil. The Bethel Church of Toronto has sent two missionaries in Papua New Guinea. The church of Smithville, Ontario, has sent a missionary in West Timor, Indonesia.

=== Canadian missions ===
The church at Smithers, BC has started a program of outreach among the First Nations people living in the Bulkley Valley region of northern British Columbia. Local outreach involved Sunday schools, teen activities, and Bible camps. Smithers Home Mission also sent a missionary to work in Prince George, B.C., the largest urban centre in Northern British Columbia.

Many churches also support a radio program called .

==Ecumenical relations==
The Canadian Reformed Churches also have &quot;ecclesiastical fellowship&quot; with a number of Reformed and Presbyterian church federations, including the following:

The Americas:
*United Reformed Churches in North America
*Reformed Church in the United States
*Orthodox Presbyterian Church
*L&#x27;Église réformée du Québec
*Igrejas Reformadas do Brasil

Abroad:
*Free Reformed Churches of South Africa
*Free Reformed Churches of Australia
*Reformed Churches of New Zealand
*Presbyterian Church in Korea (Koshin)
*Free Church of Scotland
*Free Church of Scotland (continuing)
*Reformed Churches in Indonesia (GGRI)
*Calvinist Reformed Churches in Indonesia (GGRC)
The ecclesiastical fellowships involve accepting each other’s members as their iown, inviting delegates to each other’s assemblies or synods, allowing each other’s ministers to preach in church, keeping each other informed about major ecclesiastical decisions and relations with other parties, and generally helping each other remain true to the Reformed faith.

==Education==
The Federation believes that a thorough theological education must be maintained by the churches and for the churches. As such, it operates three colleges;

The Canadian Reformed Theological Seminary, located in Hamilton, Ontario.

The Covenant Canadian Reformed Teachers College, established in 1981 to train Christian teachers to serve in the field of education. The Canadian Reformed Teachers College Association is formed with representatives from Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia school societies serving as a Board of Governors. By 2022, the CCRTC had graduated 250 students, many of whom are currently employed by Canadian Reformed schools across Canada.

The Reformed Bible College is also run by CanRC. It runs short online courses on specific Bible books and topics.

Although separate from the denomination, parents within the federation have organized a number of privately funded schools at the elementary and secondary levels across the country. In 2022, there were twenty-eight schools affiliated with the CanRC, including sixteen elementary schools, three high schools, and nine kindergarten-to-grade 12 schools.

==Care==
CanRC also runs five care homes, one in British Columbia and the rest in Ontario.

<text>University Prep (known as UPrep, formerly University Preparatory Academy) is a private, co-educational middle and high school in Wedgwood, Seattle, Washington, United States. As of 2023, school review website Niche ranks University Prep as the fifth best private high school, fourth best college prep private high school, and seventh best high school for STEM in Washington state. The mascot is the Puma, with a current student paid to wear the suit for sports games, open houses, and other school events.

== History ==

University Prep was founded in 1976 by a small group of Seattle Public Schools teachers dedicated to providing the best possible education to a heterogeneous student body. From 2002 to 2014, the head of school of University Prep was Erica L. Hamlin. From 2014 to 2019, the head of school was Matt Levinson. The temporary head of school for the 2019–2020 school year was Lila Lohr. The current head of school Veronica Codrington-Cazeau began to serve as head on school on July 1, 2020.

== Curriculum ==
The school year is organized into two semesters and four quarters, and students are expected to carry a minimum of five classes each semester. School hours are 8:25 a.m. to 2:55 p.m. for Upper School and 8:15 a.m. to 2:55 p.m. for Middle School, after which athletics, activities, and after-school programs begin. In addition to academic classes, the day includes electives, physical education, supervised study, and free periods for Upper School students. The school transitioned from a Moodle education software client to a Schoology-based learning management system. In Middle School, all students have personal Chromebooks. In Upper School, students may choose either a Windows or Apple computer. In most cases, students are given the option to complete an assignment digitally or on paper. All classes, excluding Physical Education and fine arts classes, are honors level.

== Sports ==
University Prep competes at the 1A state classification level for sports. 
The 2010–2011 school year marked the change of the old sports system. Before that academic year, the Upper School had the same athletics program as the Middle School with the exception of having tennis. Boys soccer was moved to the spring season to bring a more competitive level of play for the teams and various other reasons. To counter the absence of boys soccer in the fall, boys tennis was added to the fall athletics season.

== Campus ==
UPrep&#x27;s campus has four main buildings: the three-story classroom and administrative building (including a library, cafeteria, science classrooms, and meeting spaces), a classroom building, a gymnasium, the fine arts center (part of the classroom and administrative building), which features a proscenium theater known as Founder&#x27;s Hall as well as art and practice rooms, and the ULab which is home to an assortment of classes, a wellness center, as well as a makerspace, equipped with drones, VR headsets, 3D printers and more. The adjacent Dahl Playfield is used for sports and other activities.

== Notable alumni ==
* Sam Cho, politician and entrepreneur
* Justin Kan, internet entrepreneur and investor
* Benjamin Mako Hill, technologist and author
* Katherine Reynolds, professional soccer player
* Emi Meyer, jazz pianist and singer-songwriter
* Rob Johnson, politician
* Jackson Ragen, professional soccer player

<text>Hanyang District () forms part of the urban core of and is one of 13 urban districts of the prefecture-level city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China. Currently, it is a district and stands between the Han River (right/southern bank) and the Yangtze River (left/northwestern bank), where the former drains into the latter. It is connected by bridges with its former sister cities, Hankou and Wuchang. Presently, on the left bank of the Yangtze, it borders the districts of Qiaokou to the north across the Han River, Jianghan to the northeast, Caidian to the southwest, and Dongxihu to the northwest; on the opposite bank it borders Wuchang and Hongshan. Guiyuan Temple is located in Hanyang.

The name &quot;Hanyang&quot; means &quot;the Yang side of Han River&quot;, referring to the town&#x27;s historic location on the north (&quot;yang&quot;) bank of the Han River mouth. However, the lower Han River changed course to the north side of the town during Ming dynasty&#x27;s Chenghua-era. The town, now on the south (&quot;yin&quot;) side of the river, should have been renamed to &quot;Hanyin&quot; by naming convention, but the name &quot;Hanyang&quot; remained as it was well-established since the Sui dynasty. Administratively, the area forms Hanyang District of the modern Wuhan city, with an area of and a population of 510,000.

The Hanyang Arsenal is known for its production of the so-called &quot;Hanyang rifle&quot; - an indigenous Asian copy of the German Model 1888 Commission Rifle, which was heavily used in World War II, as well as in the Korean War and Vietnam War.

<doc id="867731" wikidata="Q389349" url="?curid=867731" title="Battle of Bussaco">
<text>The Battle of Buçaco () or Bussaco was fought on 27 September 1810 during the Peninsular War in the Portuguese mountain range of Serra do Buçaco, resulting in the defeat of French forces by Lord Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-Portuguese Army.

Having occupied the heights of Bussaco, a long ridge located at 40°20&#x27;40&quot;N, 8°20&#x27;15&quot;W, with 25,000 British and the same number of Portuguese, Wellington was attacked five times successively by 65,000 French under Marshal André Masséna. Masséna was uncertain as to the disposition and strength of the opposing forces because Wellington had deployed them on the reverse slope of the ridge, where they could neither be easily seen nor easily softened up with artillery. The actual assaults were delivered by the corps of Marshal Michel Ney and General of Division (Major General, Maj Gen) Jean Reynier, but after much fierce fighting they failed to dislodge the allied forces and were driven off after having lost 4,500 men against 1,250 Anglo-Portuguese casualties. However, Wellington was ultimately forced to withdraw to the Lines of Torres Vedras after his positions were outflanked by Masséna&#x27;s troops.

== Background ==

The Third Portuguese campaign had started with the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras and the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo.

===Operations===
In 1810, Emperor Napoleon ordered Masséna to drive the British from Portugal. Accordingly, the French marshal began the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in April. The Spanish garrison held out until 9 July when the fortress fell. The Battle of the Côa was fought soon after. The Siege of Almeida ended suddenly with a massive explosion of the fortress magazine on 26 August. With all obstacles cleared from their path, the French could march on Lisbon in strength.

It was important to delay the French until the defences being built around Lisbon, the Lines of Torres Vedras, could be completed. Using selective demolition of bridges and roads, Wellington restricted the choice of routes the French could use and slowed their advance. At the end of September, they met Wellington&#x27;s army drawn up on the ridge of Bussaco. The ridge, which at its highest rises to , lies at a right angle to the main road to Coimbra and thence to Lisbon, providing one of the few and certainly the best defensive position on the French route of march.

===Allied organisation===

Wellington had brought together six British infantry divisions:
* the Light, under Brigadier General (Brig Gen) Robert Craufurd
* the 1st, led by Major General (Maj Gen) Brent Spencer
* the 2nd, commanded by Maj Gen Rowland Hill
* the 3rd, under Maj Gen Thomas Picton, with attached Portuguese brigade
* the 4th, led by Maj Gen Lowry Cole, with attached Portuguese brigade
* the 5th, under Maj Gen James Leith, with attached Portuguese brigade
In addition, the newly re-trained (by the British under the direction of Lieutenant General William Carr Beresford) Portuguese Army supplied a two-brigade Portuguese infantry division under Maj Gen John Hamilton, and three independent Portuguese brigades led by Brig Gen Denis Pack, Brig Gen Alexander Campbell and Brig Gen John Coleman.

Brig Gen George De Grey, Brig Gen John Slade, Brig Gen George Anson and Brig Gen Henry Fane led four British cavalry brigades, plus four regiments of Portuguese cavalry. In batteries of six guns apiece, there were six British (Ross RHA, Bull RHA, Thompson, Lawson, two unknown), two King&#x27;s German Legion (Rettberg, Cleeves) and five Portuguese (Rozierres, Da Cunha Preto, Da Silva, Freira, Sousa) batteries under Brig Gen Edward Howorth.

The Anglo Portuguese army numbered 50,000, with 50% Portuguese troops.

===French organisation===
Masséna&#x27;s army of 60,000 included the II Corps under Reynier, the VI Corps led by Ney, the VIII Corps under Mag Gen Jean Andoche Junot and a cavalry reserve led by Mag Gen Louis Pierre, Count Montbrun. The divisions of Mag Gen Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle and MG Étienne Heudelet de Bierre made up Reynier&#x27;s corps. Ney&#x27;s corps had three divisions under Mag Gen Jean Marchand, Mag Gen Julien Mermet and Mag Gen Louis Loison. Junot had the divisions of Mag Gen Bertrand Clausel and Mag Gen Jean-Baptiste Solignac. Each French corps had the standard brigade of light cavalry. General of Brigade (BG) Jean Baptiste Eblé, Masséna&#x27;s artillery chief, commanded 112 guns.

===Plans===

Wellington posted his army along the crest of Bussaco Ridge, facing east. To improve his lateral communications, he had previously ordered his four officers from the Royal Corps of Engineers to cut a road that ran the length of the ridge on the reverse slope. Cole held the left (north) flank. Next came Craufurd, Spencer, Picton and Leith. Hill held the right (south) flank with Hamilton&#x27;s men attached.

Masséna, believing he easily outnumbered the British and goaded by Ney and other officers to attack the British position rather than go around it, ordered a reconnaissance of the steep ridge. Very few of Wellington&#x27;s troops were visible, as they remained on the reverse slope and were ordered not to light cooking fires. The French general planned to send Reynier at the centre of the ridge, which he believed to be the British right flank. Once the II Corps attack showed some signs of success, Masséna would launch Ney&#x27;s corps at the British along the main road. The VIII Corps stood behind the VI Corps in reserve. While Ney announced that he was ready to attack and conquer, Reynier suddenly had second thoughts, predicting his attack would be beaten.

== Battle ==

===II Corps attack===
Reynier&#x27;s troops struck in the early morning mist. Heudelet sent his leading brigade straight up the slope in a formation one company wide and eight battalions deep. When the leading regiment reached the top of the ridge, they found themselves facing the 74th Foot and two Portuguese battalions in line, plus 12 cannon. The French tried to change formation from column into line. Pelet says, &quot;The column began to deploy as if at an exercise.&quot; But the allies brought intense musketry to bear. Soon, the French infantrymen were thrown into confusion. However, they clung to a precarious toehold on the ridge.

Several hundred yards to the north, Merle&#x27;s division thrust up the ridge in a similar formation. Picton hurriedly massed his defenders by using the ridgetop road. Met at the crest by the 88th Foot, the 45th Foot and two Portuguese battalions in a concave line, the French tried unsuccessfully to deploy into line. Crushed by converging fire, the French fled down the slope. Merle was wounded, while General of Brigade Jean François Graindorge fell mortally wounded. Wellington rode up to Colonel Alexander Wallace of the 88th and remarked, &quot;Wallace, I have never witnessed a more gallant charge.&quot;

Seeing Heudelet&#x27;s second brigade standing immobile at the foot of the ridge, Reynier rode up to BG Maximilien Foy and demanded an immediate attack. With the Allies out of position after defeating the first two attacks, Foy hit a weak spot in their defences. Fortuitously, the French struck the least prepared unit in the Allied army—a Portuguese militia unit—and routed it. But the morning mist cleared, revealing no enemies in front of the British right flank. Wellington had already ordered Leith to shift his men to the north to assist Picton. Before Foy&#x27;s men could consolidate their gain, they were attacked by the 9th Foot and 38th Foot of Leith and some of Picton&#x27;s men. The French were swept off the ridge and Foy wounded. After seeing this rout, Heudelet&#x27;s other brigade withdrew to the base of the ridge.

===VI Corps attack===
Hearing gunfire, Ney assumed Reynier&#x27;s men were enjoying success and ordered an attack. In this sector, the main highway climbed a long spur past the hamlets of Moura and Sula to reach the crest at the Convent of Bussaco. Against a very heavy British skirmish line, Loison&#x27;s division fought its way forward. Near the crest, 1,800 men of the 43rd and 52nd infantry regiments lay down waiting. As Loison&#x27;s leading brigade approached the convent grounds, the two British units stood up, fired a terrific volley at point blank range and charged with the bayonet. The French brigade collapsed and fled, leaving BG Édouard Simon, their commander, wounded and a prisoner.

A short time later and slightly further south, Loison&#x27;s second brigade under BG Claude François Ferey ran into a close-range fire from two batteries plus Anglo-Portuguese musketry. This unit was also routed. A final thrust by BG Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune&#x27;s brigade of Marchand&#x27;s division met defeat when it ran into Denis Pack&#x27;s Portuguese brigade. The two sides occupied the rest of the day in vigorous skirmishing, but the French did not try to attack in force again.

== Aftermath ==

The French suffered 522 dead, 3,612 wounded, and 364 captured. The allied losses numbered 200 dead, 1,001 wounded, and 51 missing. The British and Portuguese each lost exactly 626 men.

Masséna now realised the size of Wellington&#x27;s forces and the strength of his defensive position, so that afternoon he had sent cavalry patrols to reconnoitre both ends of the Bussaco ridge, looking for a way round the position. The French army was withdrawn towards Mortagoa, with fires lit in the woods to offer some camouflage to the troops&#x27; departure. Massena issued orders on the evening of 28 September which would send his army along the Sardaõ road via Boialvo, outflanking Wellington’s position to the north of the Bussaco ridge, and opening up the main road from Oporto to Coimbra.

Wellington, after spending the night in the convent, and finding his position turned, resumed the leisurely retreat of his army towards the, still being constructed, Lines of Torres Vedras. He reached these in good order by 10 October.

Continuing to advance, Masséna had left his sick and wounded troops at Coimbra, where a few days later, they fell into the hands of the Portuguese.

This was the first major battle of the Peninsular War in which units of the reconstituted Portuguese Army fought, where the Portuguese troops played a prominent part and the victory served as a great morale boost to the inexperienced troops.

The Third Portuguese campaign proceeded with the probing of the Lines of Torres Vedras in the Battle of Sobral on 14 October. Masséna found them too strong to attack and withdrew into winter quarters. Deprived of food for his men and harried by Anglo-Portuguese hit-and-run tactics, he lost a further 25,000 men captured or dead from starvation or sickness before he retreated into Spain early in 1811. This finally freed Portugal from French occupation except for the fortress of Almeida, near the frontier. During the retreat, several actions were fought, including the Battle of Sabugal.

<doc id="867736" wikidata="Q853309" url="?curid=867736" title="Anatolian beyliks">
<text>Anatolian beyliks (, Ottoman Turkish: &quot;Tavâif-i mülûk&quot;, &quot;Beylik&quot;; ) were Turkish principalities (or petty kingdoms) in Anatolia governed by &quot;beys&quot;, the first of which were founded at the end of the 11th century. A second and more extensive period of establishment took place as a result of the decline of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm in the latter half of the 13th century.

One of the &quot;beyliks&quot;, that of the &quot;Osmanoğlu&quot; of the Kayı branch of Oghuz Turks, from its capital in Bursa completed its incorporation of the other &quot;beyliks&quot; to form the Ottoman Empire by the late 15th century.

The word &quot;beylik&quot; denotes a territory under the jurisdiction of a &quot;bey&quot;, equivalent to a duchy or principality in other parts of Europe.

== History ==

Following the 1071 Seljuk victory over the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Manzikert and the subsequent conquest of Anatolia, Oghuz Turkic clans began settling in present-day Turkey. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum&#x27;s central power established in Konya was largely as a result of using these clans under appointed &quot;beys&quot; called &quot;uç bey&quot; or &quot;uj begi&quot; (especially in border areas to ensure safety against the Byzantines); &quot;uç&quot; is a Turkish term that denotes a border or frontier territory equivalent to marches, with the similar term margrave used in other parts of Europe. These clans, led by &quot;beys&quot;, would receive military and financial support from the Seljuks in return for their fealty.

However, Mongol invasions from the East saw a decline in Seljuk power which gradually deteriorated. The Ilkhanate commanders in Anatolia then gained strength and authority which encouraged the &quot;beys&quot;, who had until then been vassals to the Sultanate of Rum, to declare sovereignty over their dominions. With the fall of Seljuk centralized power in Konya, many &quot;beys&quot; joined forces with the &quot;atabegs&quot; (former Seljuk leaders), and other religious Muslim leaders, in addition to employing Ghazi warriors from Persia and Turkestan. The ghazis fought under the inspiration of either a mullah or a general, trying to assert Islamic power, with the attacks on Byzantine territory further expanding the power sphere of the beyliks.

As the Byzantine Empire weakened, their cities in Asia Minor became gradually less and less able to resist these attacks, and many Turks began to settle in western parts of Anatolia. As a result, many more beyliks were founded in these newly conquered realms, who engaged in power struggles with the Byzantines, the Genoese, the Knights Templar, as well as between each other.

By 1300, the Turks had reached the Aegean coastline, held momentarily two centuries before. In the beginning, the most powerful states were the Karamanids and the Germiyanids in the central area. The Beylik of &quot;Osmanoğlu&quot;, who would later go on to become the Ottoman Empire, was situated in the northwest, around Söğüt, and was at that stage relatively small and possessed modest military power. Along the Aegean coast, from North to South, were the principalities of Karasi, Saruhan, Aydin, Menteşe, and Teke. The Candar dynasty (later also known as Isfendiyar) reigned in the Black Sea region around the provinces of Kastamonu and Sinop in what was the Beylik of Candar.
Under its eponymous founder, Osman I, the Beylik of Osman expanded at Byzantine expense westwards and southwards of the Sea of Marmara in the first decades of the 14th century. With their annexation of the neighboring Beylik of Karasi and their advance into Rumelia starting in 1354, they soon gained strength to emerge as the principal rivals of the Beylik of Karaman, who at the time were thought to be the strongest. Towards the end of the 14th century, the Ottomans advanced further into Anatolia either through the acquisition of towns or by cementing marriage alliances. Meanwhile, wary of an increase in Ottoman regional power, the Karamanids repeatedly engaged in conflict with the Ottomans with the help of other beyliks, Mamluks, Aq Qoyunlu (&quot;White Sheep Turkomans&quot;), Byzantines, Pontics and Hungarians, failing and losing power every time. By the close of the century, the early Ottoman leaders had conquered large parts of land from Karamanids and other less prominent beyliks. These had a short respite when their territories were restored to them after the Ottoman defeat suffered against Tamerlane in 1402 in the Battle of Ankara.

But the Ottoman state quickly collected itself under Mehmed I and his son Murad II, who reincorporated most of these beyliks into Ottoman territory in a period of about 25 years. The final blow to the Beylik of Karaman was struck by Mehmed II, who conquered their lands and re-assured a homogeneous rule in Anatolia. The further steps towards a single rule by the Ottomans were taken by Selim I who conquered territories of the Beylik of Ramadan and the Beylik of Dulkadir in 1515 during his campaign against the Mamluk Sultanate, and his son Süleyman the Magnificent who more or less completely united the present territories of Turkey (and much more) in his 1534 campaign. Many of the former Anatolian beyliks subsequently became the basis for the administrative subdivisions in the Ottoman Empire.

==List of beyliks==
=== Beyliks founded after Manzikert (1071) ===
In the list below, only the beyliks that were founded immediately after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, mostly situated towards eastern Anatolia, and who were vassals (or sometimes at war) of the centralized power of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum based in Konya are listed.

=== Beyliks founded after Köse Dağ (1243) ===
A second group beyliks emerged as a result of the weakening of this central state under the Mongol blow with the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243, which had the indirect consequence of extending Turkic territory in Western Anatolia toward the end of the 13th century.

==Society==
===Language===
Combined with the Seljuks and the migration of Turkic tribes into the Anatolian mainland, the Anatolian beyliks spread the Turkic language and Islamic culture in Anatolia. Unlike the Seljuks, whose administrative language was Persian, the Anatolian beyliks adopted spoken Turkic as their formal literary language. The Turkish language thus achieved widespread use in these principalities and reached its highest sophistication during the Ottoman era.

=== Art ===
In spite of their limited sources and the political climate of their era, art during the Anatolian beyliks flourished, probably forming the basis for Ottoman art. Although the artistic style of the Anatolian beyliks can be considered as representatives of a transition period between Seljuks and Ottomans, new trends were also acquired. Especially wandering traditional crafts artists and architects helped spread these new trends and localized styles to several beyliks across Anatolia, which resulted in innovative and original works particularly in architecture. Wood and stone carving, clay tiles and other similar decorative arts of the Seljuks were still used, however with the influence of the pursuit for new spaces and its reflections in other arts as well.

===Architecture===
Some representative examples of the Anatolian beyliks&#x27; architecture are İlyas Bey Mosque at Balat (Milet) (1404), &quot;İsabey Mosque&quot; at Selçuk (1375), &quot;Ulucami Mosque&quot; at Birgi (1312) built by the Aydın beylik. The above mosques, although being successors of Seljuq architecture, differ greatly in the increase of decorations in the interior and exterior spaces and the different placement of the courtyards and minarets. Karaman beylik also left noteworthy architectural works, such as &quot;Ulucami Mosque&quot; in Ermenek (1302), &quot;Hatuniye Madrassa&quot; in Karaman (1382), &quot;Akmedrese Madrassa&quot; in Niğde (1409), all of which respect a new style that considers and incorporates the exterior surroundings also. One of the first examples of the Anatolian beylik architecture hinting at the forming of the Ottoman architecture that aims at uniting the interior space beneath one big dome and forming a monumental architectural structure is &quot;Ulucami Mosque&quot; in Manisa (1374) built by the Saruhan beylik. Also worth noting is the increase in constructions of madrassas that points at the beyliks&#x27; attaching greater importance to sciences.

<text>Stilts are poles, posts or pillars that allow a person or structure to stand at a height above the ground.

In flood plains, and on beaches or unstable ground, buildings are often constructed on stilts to protect them from damage by water, waves or shifting soil or sand. Stilts for walking have platforms for the feet and may be strapped to the user&#x27;s legs. Stilts have been used for many hundreds of years.

==Types==

===Hand-held===
Hand-held stilts are used as childhood toys and in circus skills workshops and are of two main types: string and can/bucket stilts and pole stilts. Unlike other forms of stilts, hand-held stilts are not tied or strapped to the wearer.

Hand-held pole stilts consist of two long poles, each with a foot support. The stilt walker holds onto the upper end of the pole, rests their feet on the foot plates, and pulls upward on the pole while taking a step.

A second type of hand-held pole stilts are similar to the first type but end in a handle so the walker has more control and flexibility to move their stilts. Those type of stilts can be very high (more than under feet).

Hand-held string stilts (also known as tin can or bucket stilts) are platforms with strings attached to them. The platforms, most commonly made of tin cans or small plastic upturned buckets hold the stilt walker&#x27;s weight while the strings are used to pull the cans to the feet as they take a step.

===Peg===
Peg stilts, also known as Chinese stilts, are commonly used by professional performers. These stilts strap on at the foot, ankle, and just below the knee. Peg stilts are often made from wood but can also be made of aluminium or tubular steel. This type of stilts are the most lightweight ones and allow a user to walk quickly, to turn suddenly, and even to jump rope or dance. The stilt walker must keep moving at all times to keep their balance.

===Drywall===
Drywall stilts are adjustable tools designed for elevating users to reach high ceilings and walls, eliminating the need for frequent ladder or bench climbing and thereby reducing task completion times. They are widely utilized by tradespeople in drywall installation, electrical work, insulation, acoustics, painting, and other construction tasks. Constructed from lightweight yet robust materials like aluminum or magnesium, these stilts include features such as padded calf braces, secure straps at calves, ankles, and toes, dual-action springs for balance, and non-slip soles for stability and comfort. Compared to peg stilts used in performance arts and traditional wood stilts, drywall stilts excel in adjustability, safety, strength, and efficiency, minimizing fatigue and boosting productivity among professionals.

===Spring===
Spring stilts also known as bounce stilts are spring-loaded and allow the user to run, jump and perform various acrobatics. Spring stilts using fiberglass leaf springs were patented in the United States in 2004 under the trademark &quot;PowerSkip&quot;, marketed for recreational and extreme sports use. Using these stilts is also called powerbocking, named for the stilts&#x27; inventor, Alexander Boeck. Spring stilts are often mostly made of aluminium. Spring stilts using steel coil springs, an antecedent of the pogo stick, were attempted in the 19th century.

===Digitigrade===

The digitigrade stilt is a peg stilt whose line follows the foot and not the shin bone. This allows costumers to mimic the walk of an animal. Because of the extreme stresses on this type of design they tend to be more rare; that is, fewer successful home-made designs.

===Articulated===

This type of stilt is similar to drywall stilts in that they allow the walker to stand in one place without having to shift weight from foot to foot to stay balanced. Articulated stilts feature a flexing joint under the ball of the foot and, in one variant, under the heel. These stilts are commonly used in theme parks such as Walt Disney World and Universal Studios because they allow performers to safely dance and perform stunts that would easily damage other types of stilts. Two brands of articulated stilts include &quot;Bigfoots&quot; manufactured by Gary Ensmenger of Orlando, Florida, and &quot;Jay Walkers&quot;, manufactured by Stilt Werks of Las Vegas, Nevada. Articulated stilts can be adjusted anywhere from 18&quot; to 30&quot; high.

==History==

In Armenia, Urartian bronze belts dating from the 9th to 7th centuries BCE have been found depicting acrobats on stilts. Archaeological ruins and texts show that stiltwalking was practised in ancient Greece as far back as the 6th century BCE. The ancient Greek word for a stilt walker was κωλοβαθριστής (&quot;kōlobathristēs&quot;), from κωλόβαθρον (&quot;kōlobathron&quot;), &quot;stilt&quot;, a compound of κῶλον (&quot;kōlon&quot;), &quot;limb&quot; and βάθρον (&quot;bathron&quot;), &quot;base, pedestal&quot;. Some stilt use traditions are very old. In Namur, Belgium, stilt walkers of Namur have practiced fights on stilts since 1411. The inhabitants of marshy or flooded areas sometimes use stilts for practical purposes, such as working in swamps or fording swollen rivers. The shepherds of the Landes region of southern France used to watch their flocks while standing on stilts to extend their field of vision, while townspeople often used them to traverse the soggy ground in their everyday activities.

Stilts were used by workers to attach hop grass to wires at 12 feet above the ground. This technique was documented up to the mid 20th century before being superseded.

==Modern uses==

Stilts can be used as a prop in entertainment, as a tool to enable other types of work to be achieved and as part of a hobby or recreation.

===Entertainment===

Stilts are used widely in many countries for entertainment. Stilt walkers perform in parades, festivals, street events and at corporate functions.

The local festivals of Anguiano (La Rioja, Spain) feature a dance on stilts in which dancers go down a stepped street while turning. Other stilt walking and dancing festivals are held in Deventer, Netherlands, in early July each year, and in Namur, Belgium.

Early stilt walking acts were mostly of the style of a very tall person with the costume having long trousers or skirt to cover the stilts. More recently stilt walkers have created a wide variety of costumes that do not resemble a tall person. Examples are flowers and animals. The tall person type has also expanded to include a wide variety of themes. Examples include sportsmen, historical acts and acts based on literary or film characters.

One of the most recent varieties of stilt walking acts is a stilt walker riding a &quot;stilt bicycle&quot; with an extended seat post and handlebar stem.
With Light festivals being very popular around the world, Stilt walkers have incorporated technology in their costumes making. It is very common to see LED Robots on stilts or other light costumes at public or private events.

===Work===
Aluminium stilts are commonly used by fruit farmers in California to prune and harvest their peach, plum, and apricot trees. Stilts have been used for washing large windows, repairing roofs, and installing or painting high ceilings.

Stilts are used during drywall construction, finish painting, and hanging suspended ceiling tiles as means to reach high areas.

===Recreation===

Stilts are available to be purchased as a children&#x27;s skill toy and stilts are commonly taught in circus skills workshops at schools and summer fairs and other events.

==Records==

In 1891 Sylvain Dornon , a stilt-walker from the Landes region of France, walked from Paris to Moscow in 58 days.

On 1 October 2001 Saimaiti Yiming of China walked on stilts in 24 hours in Shanshan County, Xinjiang, China.

On 14 September 2002 Doug Hunt of Canada walked on the heaviest stilts used. They weighed for the pair. He managed 29 steps unaided on these stilts.

On 15 November 2006 Saimaiti Yiming of China took 10 steps on stilts to break the Guinness World Record for walking on the tallest stilts.

In 2008 Roy Maloy of Australia took five steps on stilts high, an unofficial record for the tallest stilts.

On 30 March 2008 Ashrita Furman of the US ran in 7minutes 13 seconds on spring stilts in Dachau, Germany.

<text>The Battle of Ostrovno () was a military engagement that took place on 25 July 1812, between French forces under the command of King of Naples Joachim Murat and Russian forces under General Ostermann-Tolstoy and ended with the Russian forces retreating from the battlefield.

==Context==
With the beginning of the Russian campaign in late June 1812, Emperor Napoleon I launched a series of envelopment maneuvers with his Grande Armée. With the Russian Imperial armies before him, Napoleon&#x27;s first such maneuver at Vilna, failed without any engagement taking place. Napoleon then launched a second such attempt aimed toward Vitebsk in a bid to turn the main Russian army under Barclay de Tolly. With French forces moving through different routes in the direction of Vitebsk, a first major engagement took place on 25 July near Ostrowno, 30 kilometers west of Vitebsk, when General Etienne de Nansouty&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Reserve Corps encountered the forces of Russian General Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy.

==Battle==
Early on the morning of 25 July, General Nansouty set two of his divisions in motion, from the village of Boudilova and towards Ostrovno, in accordance with the orders he had received from the Emperor. Meanwhile, Murat, commanding the French forces in this sector, departed from the village of Beshankovichy with two battalions of the 8th Light infantry regiment, and headed towards Nansouty&#x27;s position. Following Murat was the entire IV Army Corps of Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais, spearheaded by the division of General Delzons, which was followed at some distance by that of General Broussier.

With Murat not yet on the field of battle, Nansouty&#x27;s men encountered the vanguard of the Russian IV Corps, namely the 11th division under General Choglokov, the 23rd division of General Bakhmetiev, some cavalry and an artillery support of 66 pieces. Nansouty had under his command the light cavalry division of Bruyères (brigades Jacquinot, Piré and Nienwiewski) and the heavy cavalry division of Saint-Germain. In a bid to pin down the enemy and despite the disproportion in forces, Nansouty sent forward Piré&#x27;s brigade (16th &quot;Chasseurs à cheval&quot; and 9th &quot;Chevau-légers lanciers&quot;) in a successful charge that dislodged the Russian vanguard and took 150 prisoners of war and 8 artillery pieces.

Murat then arrived on the battlefield with reinforcements, deploying his two battalions of light infantry, and assuming personal command of Saint-Germain&#x27;s cuirassier division. With the cuirassiers successfully countercharging and repulsing a Russian Dragoon regiment that had come up to attack the right wing of the French forces, Murat realised that he was in a dangerous position and sent word to General Delzons to hasten his march towards the field of battle. Several attacks ensued, with the French committing Jacquinot&#x27;s cavalry brigade and the infantry, but with the Russians holding ground. Realising his numeric superiority, the Russian commander, General Ostermann-Tolstoy, launched an attack against both French wings, in an attempt to catch them in double envelopment. However, with the arrival of a fresh French division, Delzon&#x27;s 13th division, the Russian commander decided to call off his attack and pull back. Murat opted against a pursuit, given his inferior forces and knowing that Broussier&#x27;s division was too far off behind Delzons to be counted on.

==Result==
The Russians opted to withdraw from the field of battle. Despite Murat&#x27;s bombastic report, claiming that the enemy lost 4,000-5,000 men dead or wounded and 700 to 800 prisoners, the Russian IV Corps probably lost 2,500 men, dead and wounded. French total losses are estimated at 3,000; the 2nd cuirassiers regiment registered high losses (187 horses lost), after enduring six hours of artillery fire. Additionally, during this engagement, which Napoleon labeled as &quot;a vanguard action&quot;, French General Roussel was killed by a French sentry, who took him for a Russian soldier.

<text>Navi Mumbai (; previously New Bombay) also called New Mumbai is a planned city next to Mumbai, located in the Konkan division of the western Indian state of Maharashtra, on the mainland of India. Navi Mumbai is situated in Thane district. It is a part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Area.

The area within the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has been ranked third among 73 cities surveyed for cleanliness and hygiene by the Union Ministry of Urban Development and Quality Council of India as a part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and is being modified with various projects and formation. Navi Mumbai has for two consecutive years (2022 and 2023) held on to third rank in the Swachh Survekshan — a nationwide sanitation survey of cities — while Mumbai&#x27;s ranking slipped to 37 in 2023 from 31 in 2022.

Navi Mumbai is home to various educational institutions. Various multinational corporations have their head offices/branches across the city, making it an active business hub. Thane Belapur Marg and Palm Beach Marg are major business attraction and upmarket residential areas.

==History==

In the late 1500s, Siddis of Janjira built the Belapur Killa located atop a small hill near the mouth of the Panvel Creek. In 1682, the fort was captured by the Portuguese, who had managed to annex the regions controlled by the Siddis.

In 1733, the Marathas, led by Chimaji Appa, wrested control of the fort from the Portuguese. Appa had made a vow that if it were to be successfully recaptured from the Portuguese, he would place a garland of &quot;beli&quot; leaves in a nearby Amruthaishwar temple, and after the victory the fort was christened as Belapur Fort. The Marathas ruled the area until 23 June 1817, when it was captured by Captain Charles Gray of the British East India Company. The British partially destroyed the fort under their policy of razing any Maratha stronghold in the area.

Navi Mumbai’s journey began in the early 1970s when the Maharashtra government recognized the need for an alternative urban area to relieve the growing pressure on Mumbai, which was then struggling with issues like overcrowding, inadequate housing, and strained infrastructure.

== Planning and development ==

The population of Greater Mumbai doubled from three to nearly six million between 1951 and 1971. The population growth led to deteriorating quality of life for many in the city.

The Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act was passed in 1966, and the Bombay Metropolitan Region was created in June 1967 and finalized in 1970. The plan called for development of a twin city across the harbour, on the mainland to the east.

Before Navi Mumbai was made Railway was linked to Panvel railway station with Diva in 1964, in 1966 it was extended to Apta via Rasayani, then in 1980s to Roha and in phases was linked to Konkan Railway by 1998, in 1990s Harbour line of Suburban Railway reached Navi Mumbai connecting Vashi, Nerul.

The Board recommended that the new metro-centre or Navi Mumbai as it is now called, be developed to accommodate a population of 2.1 million.

The planning of Navi Mumbai began in 1971 and involved leading architects and urban planners including Adi Kanga, Charles Correa, Shirish Patel, Pravina Mehta and R. K. Jha. The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) was created as part of these efforts.

The area covered of the Konkan coast. Privately owned land consisting of 86 villages covering within the present limits of Navi Mumbai were acquired by the government of Maharashtra. Navi Mumbai covers the southern part of Thane taluka (from Thane District) and part of Panvel and Uran talukas (from Raigad District).

CIDCO carved out 19 small nodes with a view towards facilitating comprehensive development. These nodes were named Airoli, Ghansoli, Kopar Khairane, Vashi, Turbhe, Sanpada, Juinagar, Nerul, Seawoods, CBD Belapur, Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel, Kalamboli, Ulwe, Dronagiri and Taloja. Sanpada is the smallest node of Navi Mumbai at 8.6 km2.

CIDCO planned and constructed railway stations, roads, and public spaces in Navi Mumbai and developed nearby areas commercially. In 1973, the Vashi bridge was opened to the public for residents of Vashi, CBD Belapur and Nerul. The Sion-Panvel Highway was built to reduce the time taken to travel from Sion to Panvel. Major changes took place only after 1990, with the commissioning of a wholesale agricultural produce market at Turbhe and the construction of a commuter railway line from Mankhurd to Vashi in May 1992. These developments caused a sudden growth in economic activities and population in Navi Mumbai.

The city originally planned to create affordable housing for people who could not afford living in Mumbai, with planners intent on preventing the growth of slums in the city. However, according to the 2001 census, a fifth to a third of the population of municipalized Navi Mumbai live in slums
 and &quot;gaothans&quot; (urban villages), with thousands of buildings violating planning norms.

By the end of the 1990s, the planning authority of Navi Mumbai sought to attract private developers to the city. A new rail link between Nerul and Uran was opened on 11 November 2018.

Southern Navi Mumbai is developing rapidly in the modern nodes of Kharghar, Kamothe, Panvel, and Kalamboli. These nodes are experiencing major infrastructural developments due to their proximity to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport.

Navi Mumbai has been ranked 5th best “National Clean Air City” in India.

== Flora and fauna ==
A significant percentage of flamingos that settle in the Greater Mumbai Region are found in Navi Mumbai. Navi Mumbai also contains a stretch of mangroves.

==Administration==
===CIDCO===
The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) was responsible for maintenance, tax collection, and development of the city since its inception in the 1970s.

CIDCO planned 14 areas for the city. The seven areas in the North were Airoli node, Ghansoli node, Kopar Khairane node, Vashi node, Sanpada node, Nerul node and Belapur node. The seven areas in the South were Kharghar node, Kamothe node, Kalamboli node, Pushpak Nagar node, Panvel node, Ulwe node and Dronagiri node. Two additional municipal bodies were created, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) in the North and Panvel Municipal Corporation in the South. Each area is divided into smaller groups called sectors.

CIDCO initially developed areas like Juhu Nagar (Vashi), Nerul, and CBD Belapur with homes, schools, and roads. Later, due to a growing population with the railway extension in the 1990s, CIDCO shifted focus to Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel and Kopar Khairane. Private builders played a large role in developing these areas. CIDCO, as of 2015, runs newer areas in South Navi Mumbai.
===Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation===

On 17 December 1991, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) was constituted by the state government for maintaining some of the developed nodes of Navi Mumbai.

Local self-government started on 1 January 1992. NMMC was handed seven of the 14 nodes of the Navi Mumbai project area for its jurisdiction. However, CIDCO, as a planning authority, has rights on the open plots in these seven nodes.

The NMMC jurisdiction starts at Digha Gaon in the North and ends at Belapur in the South. The NMMC area is planned into seven nodes (zones) - Belapur, Nerul, Sanpada, Vashi, Kopar Khairane, Ghansoli and Airoli.

Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation is rated amongst the richest corporations in Maharashtra.

The Municipal Corporation is headed by a Municipal Commissioner and an elected Mayor.

==Demographics==
According to Census India, the population of Navi Mumbai in 2011 is 1,120,547, out of which males and females are 610,060 and 510,487 respectively. Meanwhile, its metropolitan population is 18,414,288, of which 9,894,088 are males and 8,520,200 are females. At least 60% of the population speaks the Marathi language.

==Transport and infrastructure==
Navi Mumbai has a robust infrastructure, is well connected to other parts of the state and country and is less polluted compared to Mumbai. The city has a good public transportation system with NMMT, the transport wing of NMMC, serving bus commuters, the Mumbai suburban railway serving train commuters and a large fleet of auto rickshaws for intra-nodal commute. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway starts at Kalamboli in Navi Mumbai. The Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), also known as the Sewri-Nhava Sheva Trans Harbour Link, is a long freeway grade road bridge connecting South Mumbai with Navi Mumbai. It opened on 12 January 2024, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the bridge.

The Mumbai suburban railway network covers most of the populated regions of the city. The most important suburban stations are Vashi, Nerul, Belapur and Panvel. The stations are planned as major railway junctions. Panvel is the only mainline station as well as the busiest railway station in Navi Mumbai. All outstation trains halt here for time periods varying from five to 20 minutes. It is an important junction; railway lines come and meet here and it is connected to almost all parts of India. A new broad gauge line is functional between Karjat &amp; Panvel.

Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses run from various area of Mumbai to Navi Mumbai &amp; Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) buses run all over Navi Mumbai and various area in Mumbai, Thane, Bhiwandi, Kalyan-Dombivli-Badlapur, Panvel-Khopoli-Taloja, Uran-Ulwe etc. The Palm Beach Marg, a long six lane road connects Vashi to CBD Belapur running parallel to the Thane Creek.

Auto rickshaws provide inter- and intra-nodal public transport across the city. Taxis operating from designated taxi stands provide the means to travel to further destinations. Taxis charge a fixed rate approved by the R. T. O., details of which can be found on popular local transit apps of the city.

Navi Mumbai has the second-largest container terminal in India after Mundra Port, Jawaharlal Nehru Port at Nhava Sheva near Uran. It is well connected by road and rail and handles approximately 56.13% of India&#x27;s container traffic. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, 30 km away, is the nearest airport to the city.

===International airport===
The Navi Mumbai International Airport is being constructed in southern Panvel near Ulwe. 
The project is being executed by Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited (NMIAL), a special-purpose vehicle formed by the Adani Airports Holdings Limited and CIDCO, which will hold 74% and 26% equity shares of NMIAL respectively. It is being built in three phases. The first phase will be able to handle 25 million passengers per annum. The foundation stone for the project was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 18 February 2018, and construction was started in August 2021 It is expected to be completed and become operational by March 2025. NMIA is set to become the first airport in the country with multimodal connectivity through metro, rail and road. The airport will be connected to three roads: NH 4B (348), the Sion Panvel Highway and through MTHL. The railway connection will be through Targhar railway station, and metro connectivity will be via Mumbai Metro Line 8 (Gold Line) and the Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1.

===Metro===

The Navi Mumbai Metro is a new rapid transit system serving the city. A network of as many as five lines has been planned, of which four lines will be constructed by CIDCO in the Navi Mumbai south region, while the second and third lines of the metro system will be constructed by NMMC and MMRDA, respectively. The first line of the metro system was completed by CIDCO and was opened to the public on 17 November 2023, after several delays spanning for around a decade due to various construction and land acquisition issues. This line includes three phases. In the first phase, the line joins the CBD Belapur station on the Mumbai suburban railway and Pendhar village. In the second phase, the line will join Taloja MIDC and Khandeshwar node (which will be extended to the under-construction Navi Mumbai International Airport in Ulwe node of the city), and in the third phase, the line will link the Pendhar and Taloja MIDC metro stations. The cost of the metro project has risen from 4,163 crore for 21.45 km in 2011 to 8,904 crore for 26.26 km in 2018.

===Other infrastructure===
The city boasts a reliable supply of electricity from various sources, and excellent motoring conditions, with numerous flyovers, broad roads, and parking lots. A hovercraft service from Vashi to Colaba and the CBD to Colaba did not succeed due to the high cost of tickets and maintenance. CIDCO is planning to relaunch its hovercraft service from Vashi, Belapur, Nerul and Airoli to Gateway of India.

==Services==

There are adequate utility services, banks, restaurants, malls, multiplexes and other shops in Navi Mumbai. The city boasts several shopping malls such as Little World Mall, Glomax Mall, Prime Mall and Pacific Mall in the most developed node of Navi Mumbai, Kharghar; K-Mall and the Orion Mall in Panvel node of the city; and Center One, Palm Beach Galleria, Citi Center, Raghuleela Mall and Inorbit Mall in Vashi, along with the Seawoods Nexus Mall in Seawoods.

==Commerce==
The Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (SEZ), located in the nodes of Dronagiri, Ulwe and Kalamboli, are planned to provide commercial growth and employment to the city. Positioned en route to the proposed Navi Mumbai Airport, this megaproject has attracted investments of close to 60,000 crores. Navi Mumbai is a new hub for newly incorporated companies &amp; start ups to establish their base in Mumbai.

==Sports==

Cricket is the most popular sport in the city. Navi Mumbai has its own International Cricket Stadium in Shiravne (Nerul) called the DY Patil Stadium which hosts IPL T-20 matches, including hosting the 2008 and 2010 IPL finals. It was one of the two venues for the inaugural edition of the Women&#x27;s Premier League (WPL) in 2023. It is also the home ground for the Indian Super League football club Mumbai City FC. The Fr. Agnel Stadium in Vashi is the training ground of the team.

Navi Mumbai was one of the host cities of the 2017 FIFA U-17 Men&#x27;s World Cup and the 2022 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup with the DY Patil Stadium hosting the final of the event in 2022.

Navi Mumbai Sports Association is the oldest sports complex in Navi Mumbai; NMSA has contributed significantly to the sports world by creating international level athletes from Navi Mumbai. Navi Mumbai has an Olympic-size swimming pool at Nerul. CIDCO has proposed two 18-hole golf course academies at Nerul and Kharghar. There are plans to have sports facilities in the proposed 80 hectare Central Park being developed in Kharghar. The CIDCO has also constructed an 11-hole golf course in Kharghar near Central Park.

==Education==
Provision of schools and colleges was a priority in the planning of Navi Mumbai. The nodes (townships) were designed to provide one primary school per 5,000 people, one high school for 12,500 people and one college for 50,000 people.

Each of the nodes is self-sufficient in terms of providing quality education. Students are given access to various syllabi, including the State Education Board, CBSE, IGCSE, IB and ICSE patterns. Other than these, CIDCO encouraged private institutions as well.

About 22.5% of the total population is considered to be school-going children. Most students attend school and college within their node (township). 76% of the students walk to their school or college, 12% use public transport, 10% use bicycles and only 2% travel by school bus.

A number of premier schools and colleges have been set up in Navi Mumbai. Even beyond local students, students from Mumbai and even outside come to Navi Mumbai in their quest for quality education. As such, Navi Mumbai is quickly acquiring the title of educational hub. Some of these premium institutions have been listed below.

<text>A rubber stamp is a political metaphor, referring to a person or institution with considerable &quot;de jure&quot; power but little &quot;de facto&quot; power — one that rarely or never disagrees with more powerful organizations. Historian Edward S. Ellis used the term toy parliament to describe a rubber-stamp legislature.

==Function==
In situations where this superior official&#x27;s signature may frequently be required for routine paperwork, a literal rubber stamp is used, with a likeness of their hand-written signature. In essence, the term is meant to convey an endorsement without careful thought or personal investment in the outcome, especially since it is usually expected as the stamper&#x27;s duty to do so. In the situation where a dictator&#x27;s legislature is a &quot;rubber stamp&quot;, the orders they are meant to endorse are formalities they are expected to legitimize, and are usually done to create the superficial appearance of legislative and dictatorial harmony rather than because they have actual power.

In a constitutional monarchy or parliamentary republic, heads of state are typically &quot;rubber stamps&quot; (or figureheads) to an elected parliament, even if they legally possess considerable reserve powers or disagree with the parliament&#x27;s decisions.

Rubber-stamp legislatures may occur even in democratic countries if the institutional arrangement allows for it.

== Examples ==
In many instances, the refusal of a constitutional monarch to rubber stamp laws passed by parliament can set off a constitutional crisis. For example, when then-king Baudouin of Belgium, because of his religious objections, refused to sign a bill legalizing abortions in April 1990, the Belgian Federal Parliament declared him temporarily unable to reign. That effectively transferred his powers to the Cabinet for a single day, consequentially overriding his veto.

=== Legislatures ===
Historian Edward S. Ellis described Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire as a toy parliament. It was created in 1876 with the sole purpose of appeasing the European powers.

One of the most famous examples of a rubber stamp institution is the Reichstag of Nazi Germany, which unanimously confirmed all decisions already made by Adolf Hitler and the highest-ranking members of the Nazi Party. Many legislatures of authoritarian and totalitarian countries are considered as rubber stamps, such as communist parliaments like the Chinese National People&#x27;s Congress, or the Italian Chamber of Fasces and Corporations during the Fascist regime.

Since the 2003 elections, Russia&#x27;s Federal Assembly has been similarly referred to as a rubber stamp institution. Russia&#x27;s State Duma (the lower house of the Federal Assembly) quickly adopted a number of laws proposed by the government without delay. The annexation of Crimea was quickly approved in 2014 with only one deputy, Ilya Ponomarev, voting against. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the legislative approvals of the annexation of occupied territories in late 2022 did not meet any resistance, giving the government full control.

Other suggested examples of rubber stamp legislatures include:

<doc id="867753" wikidata="Q3006661" url="?curid=867753" title="Robert Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn">
<text>Robert Threshie Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn, (3 April 1846 – 30 November 1923) was a British lawyer, judge and Liberal politician. He served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain between 1905 and 1912.

==Background and education==
Born in Corfu, the largest city on the island of the same name, Loreburn was the son of Sir James John Reid, Chief Justice of the Ionian Islands, at the time a British proctectorate. His mother was Mary, daughter of Robert Threshie. Loreburn was educated at Cheltenham College and Balliol College, Oxford. While at Oxford, he represented the Oxford University Cricket Club in fifteen first-class matches as a wicket-keeper, spanning from 1865 to 1868. He remained involved in cricket for many years after, with appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and Herefordshire at lower levels of the sport, amongst other sides.

==Political career==
Loreburn&#x27;s national political career began in 1880, when he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Hereford. He stayed there until 1885, when he ran unsuccessfully in Dunbartonshire, but returned to the Commons in 1886 for Dumfries Burghs. He remained in the House of Commons until 1905; during this time period, he was appointed to the offices of Solicitor General and knighted (1894) and Attorney General (1894–1895). He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1899 for services in connection with the Venezuela Boundary Arbitration Commission. He left the House of Commons in 1905, though, and became Lord Chancellor under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. On his appointment he was raised to the peerage as Baron Loreburn, of Dumfries in the County of Dumfries. (The Loreburn was a stream which historically ran close to Dumfries, and which was the source of the town&#x27;s motto and rallying cry, &quot;A Lore Burne&quot;.) Alternative explanations include the name coming from Dumfries’ motto ‘A Lore burne’, based on the war-cry ‘To the Lower Burn’.

During the 1900s and 1910s, many Liberal politicians took up the ideology of Liberal Imperialism, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (H. H. Asquith), the Secretary of State for War (Richard Haldane) and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey). This triumvirate of politicians was strongly in favour of an with France, along with the creation of a British Expeditionary Force, in the event of a war between France and Germany. These three politicians made their views known, and when Campbell-Bannerman appointed his cabinet, he appointed Loreburn Lord Chancellor as a counter to the Liberal Imperialists. Winston Churchill referred to him as belonging to the &quot;radical element&quot; within the Liberal party.

In 1908, Asquith became prime minister. Lord Loreburn&#x27;s disagreements with Haldane, Grey, Asquith, and eventually David Lloyd George became more prominent. Asquith, Lloyd George, Grey, Churchill, and Haldane met secretly on 23 August 1911, and when certain Cabinet members found out, they were furious. Reginald McKenna had recently been deprived of his position as First Lord of the Admiralty for refusing to provide military aid to the French, and he led the majority (whose members included Loreburn, McKenna, Colonial Secretary Lewis Vernon Harcourt, and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Jack Pease) in &quot;a strong line about Cabinet supremacy over all other bodies in the matter of sea and land defence&quot;. Lord Esher wrote, &quot;There has been a serious crisis. Fifteen members of the Cabinet against five. The Entente is decidedly imperilled.&quot;

He was created Earl Loreburn on 4 July 1911. Unfortunately, Lord Loreburn&#x27;s health began declining, and in the summer of 1912, he resigned his Lord Chancellorship. In a parting, &quot;valedictory&quot; letter to Lord Haldane, he wrote:

During the July Crisis Loreburn opposed British intervention in the impending continental war. On 31 July 1914 the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, to his delight, attacked the way in which Britain appeared to have been secretly committed to the side of France and Russia.

In January 1918, the House of Lords came to consider the Bill which went on to become the Representation of the People Act 1918, for the first time introducing a limited women&#x27;s suffrage. Loreburn moved an amendment to delete from the Bill the sections which would give the vote to women, but the Lords were not persuaded and on a division the amendment was lost by 134 votes against to 71 in favour.

He continued to serve as a Law Lord in the House of Lords.

==Personal life==
Lord Loreburn married firstly Emily, daughter of A. C. Fleming, in 1871. After her death in August 1904 he married secondly Violet Elizabeth, daughter of William Frederick Hicks-Beach, in 1907. There were no children from either marriage. Lord Loreburn died on 30 November 1923, aged 77, at which his titles became extinct.

<text>Vada pav, alternatively spelt wada pao, is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the Indian state of Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep-fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (&quot;pav&quot;) sliced almost in half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chili pepper. Although it originated as an affordable street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay burger in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger.

The most famous snack in Mumbai, vada pav is claimed to be a part of the culture of Mumbaikars.

==Etymology==
&quot;Batata vada&quot; in Marathi literally means &quot;potato fritter&quot;. It is a combination of the word for &quot;potato&quot; (&quot;batata&quot;) and &quot;vada&quot;, a type of fried savoury snack. &quot;Pav&quot; is a derivative of the Portuguese word &quot;pão&quot;, which means bread.

==History==
The most common theory of the vada pav&#x27;s origin is that it was invented in the erstwhile mill-heartland of Central Mumbai. 
Ashok Vaidya of Dadar is often credited with starting the first vada pav stall outside Dadar railway station in 1966. Some sources credit Sudhakar Mhatre who started his business around the same time. One of the earliest kiosks selling vada pav is said to be &quot;Khidki Vada Pav&quot;, located in Kalyan. It was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to hand out vada pavs from a window (&quot;Khidki&quot;) of their house facing the road.

The carbohydrate-rich snack catered to the cotton mill workers of what was then known as Girangaon. This potato dumpling (&quot;batata vada&quot;) placed inside a &quot;pav&quot; was quick to make, cheap (~10-15 paisa in 1971), and much convenient over the batata bhaji and chapati combination, which couldn&#x27;t be eaten in overcrowded local trains.

===Cultural importance===
The closing of textile mills in central Mumbai led to turmoil in the 1970s. Shiv Sena, the homegrown party formed during this transformative time, based itself as a party with Mill workers&#x27; interests.
The party chief, Balasaheb Thackeray encouraged Marathi people in the 1960s to become entrepreneurs, i.e. start food stalls in ways similar to the South Indians setting up Udupi restaurants. Shiv Sena attempted to physically and ideologically claim the streets through agitations as well as neighborhood-level events such as &quot;Vada pav sammelan (Vada pav jamboree)&quot;. This theme has continued even in the recent years, e.g. the 2009 introduction of &quot;Shiv vada pav&quot;.

==Variations and commercialization==
There are over 20,000 stalls selling vada pav in Mumbai. Mumbai alone has many variations of the food based on the locality. Large fast food restaurant chains such as &quot;Kunjvihar Jumbo King&quot; in Mulund and Goli Vada Pav also primarily serve vada pav. Outside of Mumbai, a variant of vada pav is &quot;pav vada&quot; which is famous in Nashik.

Annually, August 23 is celebrated as &quot;World Vada Paav Day&quot;.

==Preparation==
A boiled potato is mashed and mixed with chopped green chilli and garlic, mustard seeds, and spices (usually asafoetida and turmeric). The mass is then shaped into a ball, dipped into gram flour batter and deep fried. The resultant fritter is served by placing inside a bread bun, accompanied with one or more chutneys and fried green chilli.

<text>William Cocke (1748August 22, 1828) was an American lawyer, pioneer, and statesman. He has the distinction of having served in the state legislatures of four different states: Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi, and was one of the first two United States senators for Tennessee.

==Early life and education==
Cocke was born in Amelia County, Virginia in 1748. He was of English descent. He was the sixth of ten or eleven children of Abraham (c.1695–1760) and Mary (Batte) Cocke. He was educated at home before reading law, and was admitted to the bar in Virginia. He owned slaves.

==Political Offices==
Cocke was an elected member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. In 1776, as a colonel of militia, he led a company of men into North Carolina&#x27;s Washington District for action against the Indians. Cocke suffered accusations of cowardice following his actions at the Battle of Island Flats that followed him throughout his life. Later that year, he left Virginia and moved to what was to become Tennessee. During the organization of the State of Franklin, Cocke was elected as the would-be state&#x27;s delegate to the Congress of the Confederation.

In 1796, Cocke was chosen as a delegate to the convention that wrote the first Tennessee Constitution. The newly formed government selected Cocke to be one of the new state&#x27;s initial senators, along with William Blount. Cocke and Blount presented their credentials to the United States Senate on May 9, 1796. The Senate, however, refused to seat Cocke and Blount while the debate regarding the admission of Tennessee into the Union was on. When Tennessee was finally admitted on June 1, the issue of Cocke and Blount&#x27;s seating was again raised. The Federalist Senate held by a narrow margin (11–10) that Cocke and Blount&#x27;s election was illegal because it had occurred without congressional authorization. The Tennessee legislature duly re-selected Cocke and Blount on August 2.

Cocke&#x27;s initial term expired on March 3, 1797. The Tennessee General Assembly, however, neglected to elect a successor to Cocke; he was subsequently appointed to his former seat by Governor John Sevier on April 22, 1797, until the General Assembly belatedly elected his successor, Andrew Jackson. Later, he was elected by the Tennessee Assembly to the other U.S. Senate seat, and served from March 4, 1799, to March 3, 1805.

Cocke was appointed a judge of the First Circuit Court of Tennessee. On November 7, 1811, he was impeached by the Tennessee House of Representatives, and on October 10, 1812, at the end of his impeachment trial, he was convicted by the Tennessee Senate on one of the three articles of impeachment and thereby removed from office.

==Personal life and family==
Cocke engaged in a limited law practice, and spent more time on the frontier than he did in a law office. He was involved in exploration while in the company of Daniel Boone, traveling through much of what was to become eastern Kentucky and East Tennessee.

His son, John Alexander Cocke, was a four-term U.S. Representative from Tennessee; his grandson, William Michael Cocke, was a two-term U.S. Representative from Tennessee.

==Later life and death==
Cocke was appointed a judge of the First Judicial Circuit of Tennessee in 1809. He later resigned this position and moved to Mississippi. There, he was elected to the state legislature in 1813. He briefly returned to military duty, serving under Andrew Jackson in the Creek War. In 1814, he was appointed by President James Madison to be an Indian agent to the Chickasaw nation.

Cocke died in Columbus, Lowndes County, Mississippi, in 1828 and is buried there, in Friendship Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Cocke County, Tennessee is named in his honor.

<doc id="867767" wikidata="Q1071578" url="?curid=867767" title="Battle of Smolensk (1812)">
<text>The Battle of Smolensk was the first major battle of the French invasion of Russia. It took place on 16–18 August 1812 and involved about 45,000 men of the under Emperor Napoleon I against about 30,000 Russian troops under General Barclay de Tolly. Napoleon occupied Smolensk by driving out Prince Pyotr Bagration&#x27;s Second Army. The French artillery bombardment burned the city to the ground. Of 2,250 buildings, 84% were destroyed with only 350 surviving intact. Of the city&#x27;s 15,000 inhabitants, about 1,000 were left at the end of the battle inside the smoking ruins. With over 15,000 casualties, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the invasion.

==Prelude==
===Vitebsk operation===
The Russian First Western Army under General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly slipped away from Vitebsk on 27 July after an inconclusive fight against Emperor Napoleon, avoiding a general engagement. Napoleon was frustrated by his inability to bring the Russian army to battle and lingered at Vitebsk until 12 August to reform his and wait for stragglers to catch up. General Jean-Andoche Junot replaced King Jérôme as commander of the Westphalian VIII Corps and the Corps joined Napoleon&#x27;s main army on 4 August near Orsha.

===French situation===
After five weeks of non-stop operations, the main 375,000-man strike force available to Napoleon had been reduced to 185,000 men by a host of factors. 90,000 troops under Marshal Nicolas Oudinot and Generals Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, Jean Reynier and Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg had been detached for various missions. Russian forces had inflicted thousands of combat losses on Napoleon&#x27;s main army, but the primary cause in the reduction of his force was strategic consumption—the need to garrison cities, towns, fortresses and forward supply depots.

Rapid forced marches and the inability of supply wagon trains led to high incidences of desertion and tens of thousands of losses to hunger and disease, most notably dysentery. The scorching July heat reduced the availability of water supplies. Huge numbers of cavalry horses and transportation horses and oxen had died due to a lack of grazing areas and the inability of the wagons to carry enough fodder.

===Russian plan===

The loss of vast stretches of Russian territory to the advancing French led to a crisis and shift in power in the Russian high command. An aggressive &quot;Russian&quot; faction around Prince Pyotr Bagration called for an immediate, all-out attack against Napoleon. They were supported by Czar Alexander I and the bulk of the officer corps. The &quot;foreign&quot; faction around Barclay de Tolly, composed mostly of officers of German extraction, advocated the continuation of the present policy of delay and withdrawal to dilute Napoleon&#x27;s striking power. Under strong pressure from above and below, including threats of force, Barclay agreed to an offensive on 6 August. Ignorant as to French dispositions, Barclay intended to outflank what he presumed to be the isolated corps of Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais near Rudnia, destroy it, and inflict further losses on the French as they came to Eugéne&#x27;s aid.

Barclay advanced on Rudnia and Poryeche on 7 August. Count Matvei Platov&#x27;s Cossacks imposed a sharp defeat on General Horace Sébastiani&#x27;s cavalry near Inkovo the same day, inflicting 600 French casualties. On 8 August, Barclay received false intelligence that Eugène&#x27;s corps was at Poryeche and reoriented half of his army to face north. Platov was directed to rejoin Barclay&#x27;s army and Bagration was to move to Vidra. Bagration disobeyed his orders, fearing French Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout&#x27;s threat to his left flank. He declared his army was hungry and sick and moved to Smolensk. Barclay failed to stop him, merely adjusting his own forces to compensate. On 11 August, Barclay stayed put and engaged only in outpost fighting with French cavalry under Neapolitan King Joachim. On 12 August, Barclay&#x27;s scouts found Poryeche empty and he directed Platov to reconnoiter the French movements. The Russian offensive had failed due to disagreements among the generals, Barclay&#x27;s inactivity and pointless marches that lost the Russians time they could not recover.

===French plan===

Napoleon had expected a Russian offensive and saw in it a great opportunity to envelop and annihilate the Russian army. He directed Marshal Jacques MacDonald to cross the Daugava to help out Oudinot&#x27;s force and ordered Oudinot and Saint-Cyr to attack Prince Peter Wittgenstein&#x27;s 20,000-strong corps to prevent it from assisting Barclay. Napoleon came up with what became known as the Smolensk maneuver, a masterful operation designed to outflank Barclay from the south, cut off the Russians from Moscow and destroy the isolated Russian army, thus bringing the war to an end.

The action at Inkovo on 7 August was seen by Napoleon as heralding an immediate Russian attack. Worried, he deployed his army in a defensive posture around III Corps. By 10 August, Barclay&#x27;s glacial slowness of operations had convinced Napoleon that the threat had passed. He proceeded with his maneuver. Vitebsk was garrisoned with a force of 3,800 men, which later grew to 7,000, to protect the French lines of communications. Napoleon did not know Barclay&#x27;s exact location and was acting on instinct. The would advance in two huge columns commanded by Napoleon and Davout. Napoleon&#x27;s column consisted of Joachim Murat&#x27;s cavalry, the Imperial Guard, III Corps and IV Corps. It would cross the Dnieper at Rosasna. Davout&#x27;s column would cross at Orsha, composed of I Corps, V Corps and VIII Corps. This giant force would advance east along the left bank of the Dnieper, swing north to cut the Smolensk-Moscow road and annihilate the isolated Russians. Latour-Maubourg&#x27;s cavalry would attack down the Dnieper as a diversion. Napoleon&#x27;s deployment remained hidden from the Russians due to a thick cavalry screen under Generals Emmanuel de Grouchy, Étienne de Nansouty and Louis-Pierre Montbrun. French engineers under General Jean Baptiste Eblé erected four pontoon bridges across the Dnieper near Rosasna on the night of 13–14 August and by daybreak the 175,000-strong was advancing rapidly toward Smolensk.

===Battle of Krasnoy===
Barclay had left Generalmajor Neverovski&#x27;s 27th Division to guard Krasnoy, along with some cavalry and artillery. This force of 5,500–7,200 infantry, 1,500 cavalry and 10–14 guns was attacked by 20,000 Frenchmen under Murat and Marshal Michel Ney beginning around 2:30 PM on 14 August. Murat&#x27;s and Ney&#x27;s inability to coordinate their infantry-cavalry operations allowed the Russians to get away, at the cost of 1,500–2,300 Russian men and seven guns as well as 500 French casualties. The French had multiple excellent chances in the First Battle of Krasnoi to annihilate the Russians but failed to do so.
Neverovski retreated into Smolensk, shutting the gates behind him. The French inability to capture the city on the fly imposed a disastrous delay on their operations. Neverovski requested reinforcements from Bagration and received Nikolai Raevsky&#x27;s VII Corps, which arrived on the morning of 15 August to defend the southern bank of the Dnieper near Smolensk.

Barclay learned of the French attack from Neverovski. He interpreted Napoleon&#x27;s offensive as a retreat and prepared to capture Vitebsk. He ordered Bagration to move south along the Dnieper. Bagration refused, pointing out that Smolensk, Neverovski and Raevsky were in grave danger. He then received permission from Barclay to deploy to the Dnieper&#x27;s southern bank at Katan. Barclay ordered General Dmitry Dokhturov&#x27;s corps to join Bagration and directed the Smolensk governor to evacuate the city archives. No decisive action was undertaken by Barclay due to uncertainty about Napoleon&#x27;s locations. Czar Alexander left the army and turned over command of the armies to Barclay, ordering him to defend Smolensk. Barclay decided to rush his and Bagration&#x27;s men down the road from Vitebsk to Smolensk. With his entire plan of operations hanging in the balance, Napoleon failed to act with sufficient vigor and ordered a 24-hour halt to the advance instead.

==Battle==
Smolensk, a historic fortress city with a population of 12,600, resides along the primary Western route linking Warsaw to Moscow. Prior to the First Partition of Poland, it stood as a border town within the Russian Empire. The formidable Smolensk Kremlin, encompassed by 38 bastion towers and a sturdy stone wall, served as a significant stronghold. To the south, the River Dnieper flows adjacent to this fortified kremlin. Napoleon&#x27;s anticipation presumed that the Russians would engage outside Smolensk to shield the city from potential destruction. (The Assumption Cathedral in Smolensk housed one of the most venerated icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Our Lady of Smolensk attributed to St Luke.) However, by August 16, French forces encountered a heavily fortified city defended by Bagration&#x27;s troops. The defenses were further reinforced by the subsequent arrival of Barclay and the main Russian army.

The main battle was fought on 16 August. An initial probing force captured two suburbs but failed to bring the Russians out to battle. Napoleon ordered a general assault with three corps of the , supported by two hundred artillery pieces. This was initially successful, the intense artillery bombardment setting the city on fire. French forces lacked ladders or climbing apparatus to scale the city walls and were under counter fire from Russian artillery. By nightfall, most of the city was burning.

So, as soon as day broke —we marched against the city. The river was crossed below the city. The suburbs on the northern side were stormed, set on fire, and burned up. My company&#x27;s doctor, named Staüble, had his arm shot away in crossing the stream, and he died afterward. No longer could I pay any attention to my comrades and, therefore, knew not in what way they perished or were lost. Everyone fired and struck at the enemy in wild madness, and no one could tell whether he was in front, in the middle, or behind the center of the army.

To save the army, Barclay de Tolly abandoned the city destroying all ammunition stores and bridges leaving a small force to hold out for two days to cover his retreat. Around dawn on 17 August, Polish forces successfully breached the walls, and in a few hours the main French forces entered the city. Barclay retained forces on the other side of the river preventing a crossing until the night of August the 18th. The city was almost completely destroyed.

===Casualties===

Barclay de Tolly claimed 4,000 Russian casualties, while Bogdanovich spoke of 6,000 . Docturov&#x27;s VI Corps had 16,800 men available prior to the battle but only 6,000 capable of combat at its end, which would mean 10,800 casualties for one Russian corps alone. Prince Eugen of Württemberg&#x27;s division lost 1,300 men alone. Gaston Bodart gave 6,000. whilst David Chandler estimates them as 12,000–14,000. Alexander Mikaberidze suggests 10,000 Russian casualties at Smolensk.

Napoleon claimed 700 French killed and 3,100–3,200 wounded. His estimate is disputed, as I Corps alone under Lobau lost 6,000. Chandler puts French losses at 10,000, while Mikaberidze also suggested 10,000. Bodart listed 10,000. Russian authors claimed the French losses were as high as 20,000.

==Aftermath==
The Tsar replaced the unpopular Barclay de Tolly with Kutuzov, who took over the army on 29 August at Tsaryovo-Zaymishche and ordered his men to prepare for battle. Kutuzov understood that Barclay&#x27;s decision to retreat had been correct, but the Tsar, the Russian troops and Russia could not accept further retreat. His order to search for a battleground eastwards led subsequently to the Battle of Lubino and Borodino.

==Legacy==
The Battle of Smolensk is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;SMOLENSK 17 VIII 1812&quot;.

<text>Brabus GmbH (stylized in uppercase) is a German high-performance automotive aftermarket tuning company founded in 1977 in Bottrop (Ruhr area). Brabus specialises mainly in Mercedes-Benz, Maybach and Smart vehicles. They have also modified other vehicles including Porsche.

== History ==
The company began with Bodo Buschmann wanting to customise his cars. Discovering most existing customisers could not grasp his vision or meet his requirements, he started his own brand. Brabus GmbH was registered in 1977 in West Germany with Buschmann&#x27;s friend Klaus Brackmann to satisfy German law requiring a company to be established with at least two people. The company name was derived from the first three characters of the founders&#x27; surnames (Brackmann, Buschmann). Following the company&#x27;s foundation, Brackmann sold his company shares to Buschmann for 100 euros.

In 2012, Brabus had started building its third factory in Bottrop.

== Operations ==
Brabus&#x27;s primary focus is to achieve maximum car performance through the increase of horsepower and speed. Customers can either buy cars from Brabus, or send in their cars to be customized and/or overhauled. Customers ordering a car directly involves Brabus purchasing a particular model from Mercedes and then modifying it according to the customer&#x27;s requests. Brabus is known for providing expensive tuning.

Brabus also offers cosmetic modifications including low profile spoilers, body kits, carbon fiber splitters, and multi-piece alloy wheels. Other upgrades include racing LSDs, open racing exhaust systems, twelve-piston disc brakes, and engine remapping. Customers can also have complete engine overhauls, or have new crate engines from AMG modified for them.

Brabus engines range from small K4 blocks for SLK roadsters and CLK-Class to the twin-turbo blocks for the S-Class. The company also provides improvements to the interior from custom upholstery, gauges, shift knobs, pedals, and trim to various electronics such as wider LCD screens for the Maybach.

* Brabus Fortwo Edition Red - 35 Coupé and 15 Cabrio models.
Between 2006 and 2007 Brabus produced and sold 50 Smart Fortwo Edition Red cars for the UK market. All of these vehicles were originally produced with a black Tridion safety cell and black plastic panels, the car was then later repainted at Brabus in (EB6 colour code) Intense Red. The car was built with the usual Brabus additions to the exterior, these being Brabus front grill (with fog lights), Brabus front splitter, Brabus side skirts, black plastic Brabus rear exhaust panel, and 16-inch Brabus Monoblock alloy wheels. These vehicles were always rumoured to be Brabus Nightrun Fortwo&#x27;s that were later reworked.

The interior was bespoke to this limited run of vehicles. The interior is half leather and half alcantara with red stitching. The seats use the smaller, non-sport foams. This is unusual as all other Brabus 450 Fortwo&#x27;s use wider sports-style seat foams. The door card inserts are alcantara with leather door pockets with the dashboard finished in alcantara with an aluminium Brabus plaque displayed in the centre. None of these vehicles had heated seats or electric wing mirrors. All Brabus Edition Red Fortwo&#x27;s are equipped with a 3-spoke steering wheel, bespoke floor mats, air conditioning, CD player, Brabus clock and rev counter, Brabus speedo displaying 120 mph, and all of the removable interior plastics (including door handles and steering wheel trim) repainted in Intense Red to match the exterior.

Designed on the base of the Fortwo Brabus, this limited edition example is powered by a 55kW 3-cylinder turbocharged engine although all of the upgraded hardware is from the 60kW motor with a different tune. Brabus upgrades over a standard 698cc Smart Fortwo include a 60kW camshaft, 60kW yellow Bosch injectors, 60kW turbocharger, 60kW turbo to intercooler pipe (TIK), Brabus branded central twin outlet exhaust with chrome tips, aluminium Brabus intake manifold name plaque and the gearbox from a Smart Roadster (different gear ratios compared with a standard Smart Fortwo).

<doc id="867776" wikidata="Q2721562" url="?curid=867776" title="Bhel puri">
<text>Bhelpuri is a savoury snack originally from India, and is also a type of chaat. It is made of puffed rice, crumbled crunchy puri, onions, coriander and tossed with two chutneys: a green spicy coriander chutney and a brown tangy tamarind chutney.

== Origin ==
Bhel is often identified as a &#x27;beach snack&#x27;, strongly associated with the beaches of Mumbai, such as Chowpatty or Juhu. One theory for its origin is that, it was invented at a restaurant called Vithal near Victoria Terminus. According to another theory, bhelpuri was conceived by the city&#x27;s Marathi community, who made it by adding complex flavours to the simple North Indian chaat. Marathi housewives began making it and invented several varieties like the pakodi puri, and as it grew in popularity, many communities made their own regional variations.

== Variations ==
The Mumbai recipe has spread to most parts of India, where it has been modified to suit local food availability. Dry bhel is made from bhadang, a spicy namkeen (snack) from Western Maharashtra, and is consumed after garnishing with onions, coriander and lemon juice. The Bengali variant of bhelpuri is called &quot;jhalmuri&quot; (meaning &quot;spicy puffed rice&quot;) and bhelpuri refers to panipuri instead in that ethnicity. A local Karnataka variant of bhelpuri is known as &quot;churumuri&quot; or &quot;churmuri&quot;. The recipe exists in many parts of India.

== Commonly used ingredients ==
Bhelpuri is made from puffed rice and sev (a fried snack shaped like thin noodles made from besan flour) mixed with potatoes, onions, chat masala and chutney and a mixture of other fried snacks as the base of the snack. Bhelpuri has a balance of sweet, salty, tart and spicy flavors, with different textures as well, including crispy and crunchy from the puffed rice and fried sev. Other commonly used ingredients include tomatoes and chillis added to the base. In northern India, recipes also include boiled potatoes cut into small pieces.

ACCESS began operating out of a storefront at Dearborn’s South End in 1971. Staffed by volunteers, ACCESS’ first board president was George Khoury, accompanied by Hajjah Aliya Hassan as the first volunteer director.

Without the help of The Association of Arab-American University Graduates (AAUG), and its donation of the first months rent, the opening of ACCESS on Vernor Highway would not have been possible. In subsequent years, ACCESS moved to Hashemite Hall until it burned down. In 1973, the building on Saulino Court was purchased by the Yemeni Benevolent Association, and offered to ACCESS free of charge, where the administrative offices still reside today.
The expansion of ACCESS has grown to five locations, including the Arab American National Museum (AANM), which was founded on May 5, 2005.

<doc id="867783" wikidata="Q771425" url="?curid=867783" title="Battle of Valutino">
<text>The Battle of Valutino (also called the battle of Lubino) took place on 19 August 1812, between a corps of French and allied troops led by Marshal Ney, about 35,000 strong, and a strong rear-guard of General Barclay de Tolly&#x27;s Russian army of about 25,000, commanded by the general himself. The Russians were strongly posted in marshy ground, protected by a small stream, about 20 kilometers east of Smolensk. The French, attacking resolutely, captured the Russian position in the face of considerable physical obstacles.

==Prelude==
Napoleon&#x27;s hopes of trapping General Barclay&#x27;s army were dashed when he discovered that the Russian force awaiting the French was a rearguard under General Tuchkov. Barclay&#x27;s main force of three infantry and one cavalry corps was strung out near Smolensk, trying to get away from the French after the Battle of Smolensk. The rearguard then turned around to fight the French on the Stragan river.

==Battle==
After a heavy bombardment, Ney launched an assault against the Russians, crossing the Stragan but failing to capture the crest. Murat&#x27;s cavalry attacks were bogged down in marshy ground and accomplished nothing. General Junot&#x27;s force was close to the battlefield and was urged to attack the Russians by Murat. Junot did not engage, and the opportunity for a decisive victory passed.

When Napoleon heard of Junot&#x27;s failure to attack, they had been friends since their early twenties, he is said to have shouted in frustration “[Junot] will now never earn his Marshal’s Baton!”

A few hours later, Ney launched the last French attack. General Gudin led the assault and was hit by a cannonball, which removed one leg. He died three days later from infection. The French managed to capture the crest after hard fighting. By that point the majority of Barclay&#x27;s army had escaped and was heading towards Lubino.

==Aftermath==
The French suffered around 7,000-8,800 casualties. The Russians lost about 6,000. Napoleon was furious after the battle, realizing that another good chance to trap and destroy the Russian army had been lost.

<text>Kala Ghoda (IPA:Kāḷā Ghōḍā&quot;&quot;) is a crescent-shaped art district/neighborhood in Mumbai, India. It hosts several of the city&#x27;s heritage buildings including museums, art galleries and educational institutions like the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, the Jehangir Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Modern Art, and The Arts Trust - Institute of Contemporary Indian Art.

The area hosts the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival annually in February. The area is sandwiched between Mumbai Port&#x27;s docklands to the east, Regal Cinema to the south, Hutatma Chowk and Flora Fountain to the north and Oval Maidan to the west. The Bombay Stock Exchange is to its north east.

==History==
The name &quot;Kala Ghoda&quot; is a reference to the presence of a black stone statue of King Edward VII (as the then Prince of Wales) mounted on a horse that was built by Jewish businessman and philanthropist Albert Abdullah David Sassoon, although this statue was removed from the precinct in 1965 and subsequently placed inside the Byculla Zoo. A local legend stated that the statues of King Edward and the one of Shivaji on a horse at the Gateway of India came to life after midnight and battled it out on the streets. In 2017, the &#x27;Kala Ghoda&#x27; returned to the area with a new statue of a similar looking horse without a rider, being commissioned by the Kala Ghoda Association. The statue, titled &#x27;Spirit of Kala Ghoda&#x27; was designed by architect Alfaz Miller and sculpted by Shreehari Bhosle.

Prior to the founding of the Bombay Stock Exchange, merchants often traded shares at the junction of Rampart row and Meadow street.

==Landmarks==

The Esplanade Mansion, India&#x27;s oldest surviving cast iron building, is in Kala Ghoda. Formerly known as Watson&#x27;s Hotel, it was the site where films were introduced to India with a screening of the Lumiere Brothers Cinematograph in 1896. The offices of art publication, &quot;Marg&quot;, are on the third floor of the historic Army and Navy Building.

<text>Clothing in India varies with the different ethnicities, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of the people of each region of India. Historically, clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina, langota, achkan, lungi, sari, to perform rituals and dances. In urban areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all social levels. India also has a great diversity in terms of weaves, fibers, colors, and the material of clothing. Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned. The clothing in India also encompasses a wide variety of Indian embroidery, prints, handwork, embellishments, and styles of wearing clothes. A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India.

== History ==
India&#x27;s recorded history of clothing goes back to the fifth millennium BC in the Indus Valley Civilisation where cotton was spun, woven and dyed. Bone needles and wooden spindles have been unearthed in excavations at the site. The cotton industry in ancient India was well developed, and several of the methods survive until today. Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian described Indian cotton as &quot;a wool exceeding in beauty and goodness that of sheep&quot;. Indian cotton clothing was well adapted to the dry, hot summers of the subcontinent. The grand epic Mahabharata, composed in about 400 BC, tells of the god Krishna staving off Draupadi&#x27;s disrobing by bestowing an unending &quot;cheera&quot; upon her. Most of the present knowledge of ancient Indian clothing comes from rock sculptures and paintings in cave monuments such as Ellora. These images show dancers and goddesses wearing what appears to be a dhoti wrap, a predecessor to the modern sari. The upper castes dressed in fine muslin and wore gold ornaments The Indus civilisation also knew the process of silk production. An analysis of Harappan silk fibres in beads has shown that silk was made by the process of reeling, a process allegedly known only to China until the early centuries AD. Kimkhwab is an Indian brocade woven of silk and gold or silver thread. The word &quot;kimkhwāb,&quot; derived from the Persian, means &quot;a little dream&quot;, &quot;Kimkhwāb,&quot; known in India from ancient times, was called &quot;hiraṇya,&quot; or cloth of gold, in Vedic literature (&quot;c.&quot; 1500 BC). In the Gupta period (4th–6th century AD) it was known as &quot;puṣpapaṭa a, &quot; or cloth with woven flowers. During the Mughal period (1556–1707), when &quot;kimkhwāb&quot; was extremely popular with the rich, the great centres of brocade weaving were Benares (Vārānasi), Ahmādābād, Surat, and Aurangābād. Benares is now the most important centre of &quot;kimkhwāb&quot; production. When Alexander invaded Gandhara in 327 BC, block-printed textiles from India were noticed.

According to the Greek historian Arrian:

&quot;The Indians use linen clothing, as says Nearchus, made from the flax taken from the trees, about which I have already spoken. And this flax is either whiter in colour than any other flax, or the people being black make the flax appear whiter. They have a linen frock reaching down halfway between the knee and the ankle, and a garment which is partly thrown round the shoulders and partly rolled round the head. The Indians who are very well-off wear earrings of ivory; for they do not all wear them. Nearchus says that the Indians dye their beards various colours; some that they may appear white as the whitest, others dark blue; others have them red, others purple, and others green. Those who are of any rank have umbrellas held over them in the summer. They wear shoes of white leather, elaborately worked, and the soles of their shoes are many-coloured and raised high, in order that they may appear taller.&quot;

Evidence from the first century AD shows the Buddhas were portrayed as wearing saṃghāti that forms a part of the Kasaya of Buddhist monks. During the Maurya and Gupta period, the people wore both stitched and non-stitched clothing. The main items of clothing were the Antariya made of white cotton or muslin, tied to the waist by a sash called &quot;Kayabandh&quot; and a scarf called the Uttariya used to drape the top half of the body.
New trade routes, both overland and overseas, created a cultural exchange with Central Asia and Europe. Romans bought indigo for dyeing and cotton cloth as articles of clothing. Trade with China via the Silk Road introduced silk textiles using domesticated silkworms. Chanakya&#x27;s treatise on public administration, the Arthashastra written around the third century BC, briefly describes the norms followed in silk weaving.

A variety of weaving techniques were employed in ancient India, many of which survive to the present day. Silk and cotton were woven into various designs and motifs, each region developing its distinct style and technique. Famous among these weaving styles were the Jamdani, &quot;Kasika vastra&quot; of Varanasi, &quot;butidar&quot;, and the Ilkal saree. Brocades of silk were woven with gold and silver threads. The Mughals played a vital role in the enhancement of the art, and the paisley and &quot;Latifa Buti&quot; are examples of Mughal influence.

Dyeing of clothes in ancient India was practised as an art form. Five primary colours (&quot;Suddha-varnas&quot;) were identified and complex colours (&quot;Misra – varnas&quot;) were categorised by their many hues. Sensitivity was shown to the most subtlest of shades; the ancient treatise, Vishnudharmottara states five tones of white, namely Ivory, Jasmine, August moon, August clouds after the rain and the conch shell. The commonly used dyes were indigo(&quot;Nila&quot;), madder red and safflower. The technique of mordant dyeing was prevalent in India since the second millennium BC. Resist dyeing and Kalamkari techniques were hugely popular and such textiles were the chief exports.

Integral to the history of Indian clothing is the Kashmiri shawl. Kashmiri shawl varieties include the Shahtoosh, popularly known as the &#x27;ring shawl&#x27; and the pashmina wool shawls, historically called &quot;pashm&quot;. Textiles of wool find mention as long back as the Vedic times in association with Kashmir; the Rig Veda refers to the Valley of Sindh as being abundant in sheep, and the god Pushan has been addressed as the &#x27;weaver of garments&#x27;, which evolved into the term &quot;pashm&quot; for the wool of the area. Woolen shawls have been mentioned in Afghan texts of the third century BC, but reference to the Kashmir work is done in the 16th century AD. The sultan of Kashmir, Zain-ul-Abidin is generally credited with the founding of the industry. A story says that the Roman emperor Aurelian received a purple pallium from a Persian king, made of Asian wool of the finest quality. The shawls were dyed red or purple, red dye procured from cochineal insects and purple obtained by a mixture of red and blue from indigo The most prized Kashmiri shawls were the Jamavar and the &quot;Kanika Jamavar&quot;, woven using weaving spools with coloured thread called &quot;kani&quot; and a single shawl taking more than a year for completion and requiring 100 to 1500 &quot;kanis&quot; depending on the degree of elaboration.

Indian textiles were traded from ancient times with China, Southeast Asia, and the Roman Empire. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions mallow cloth, muslins and coarse cottons. Port towns like Masulipatnam and Barygaza won fame for its production of muslins and fine cloth. Trade with the Arabs who were middlemen in the spice trade between India and Europe brought Indian textiles into Europe, where it was favored by royalty in the 17th–18th century. The Dutch, French and British East India Companies competed for monopoly of the spice trade in the Indian Ocean but were posed with the problem of payment for spices, which was in gold or silver. To counter this problem, bullion was sent to India to trade for the textiles, a major portion of which were subsequently traded for spices in other trade posts, which then were traded along with the remaining textiles in London. Printed Indian calicos, chintz, muslins and patterned silk flooded the British market and in time the designs were copied onto imitation prints by textile manufacturers in Britain, reducing the dependence on India.

Opposition to British rule in India, in particular the 1905 partition of Bengal, sparked the nationwide Swadeshi movement. One of the integral aims of the movement was to attain self-sufficiency, and to promote Indian goods while boycotting British goods in the market. This was idealised in the production of Khadi. Khadi and its products were encouraged by the nationalist leaders over British goods, while also being seen as a means to empower the rural artisans.

== Female clothing ==
In India, women&#x27;s clothing varies widely and is closely associated with the local culture, religion and climate.

Traditional Indian clothing for women across the country in Indian includes saris worn with choli tops; a skirt called a lehenga or chaniya worn with choli and a dupatta scarf to create an ensemble called a ghagra choli; while many south Indian children traditionally wear &quot;Langa voni&quot;.. Across India, saris are traditionally worn by married women although in areas such as Rajasthan and Gujarat, for example, the chaniya choli (as it is called there) is worn by all ages. In many rural parts of India, traditional clothing is still worn today due to ease of materials, comfort and accessibility. Jewellery is hugely significant for Indian men and women. Men traditionally wear rings with stones or necklaces, and for women, there is an assortment of jewellery that includes maang-tikka, earrings, nose rings, necklaces, bangles, waist chains, anklets and toe-rings - these all form part of the traditional Solah Shringaar for married Hindu women. A Hindu religious mark called a tilak is usually applied with sandalwood or vermillion between the eyebrows - and as such the modern iteration of the tilak known as a bindi is also worn. Indo-Western clothing is the fusion of Western and Subcontinental fashion. Other clothing includes the churidar, gamucha, kurti and kurta, dhoti, lungi and sherwani.

The traditional style of clothing in India varies with male or female distinctions. This is still followed in rural areas, though is changing in the urban areas.

=== Traditional clothing ===

==== Sari and wrapped garments ====

A &quot;saree&quot; or &quot;sari&quot; is a female garment in the Indian subcontinent. A sari is a strip of unstitched cloth, ranging from four to nine meters in length, that is draped over the body in various styles. These include: Sambalpuri Saree from East, Mysore silk and Ilkal of Karnataka and, Kanchipuram of Tamil Nadu from South, Paithani from Maharashtra and Banarasi from North among others. The most common style is for the sari to be wrapped around the waist, with one end then draped over the shoulder baring the midriff. The sari is usually worn over a petticoat. Blouse may be &quot;backless&quot; or of a halter neck style. These are usually more dressy with a lot of embellishments such as mirrors or embroidery and may be worn on special occasions. Women in the armed forces, when wearing a sari uniform, don a half-sleeve shirt tucked in at the waist. Teenage girls may wear half-sarees, a three-piece set consisting of a langa, a choli and a stole wrapped over it like a saree. Women usually wear full sarees. Indian wedding saris are typically red or pink, a tradition that goes back to India&#x27;s pre-modern history.

Saris are usually known by different names in different places. In Kerala, white saris with golden borders, are known as &quot;kavanis&quot; and are worn on special occasions. A simple white sari, worn as a daily wear, is called a &quot;mundu&quot;. Saris are called &quot;pudavai&quot; in Tamil Nadu. In Karnataka, saris are called &quot;Seere&quot;. The traditional production of handloom sarees is important to economic development in rural communities. The Sari Series provides a documented resource of over 80 different regional drapes of India.

; Mundum Neriyathum
&quot;Mundum Neriyathum&quot; is the oldest remnant of the ancient form of the saree which covered only the lower part of the body. It is the traditional dress of women in Kerala, a state in the southwestern part of India.
The basic traditional piece is the &quot;mundu&quot; or lower garment which is the ancient form of the saree denoted in Malayalam as &#x27;Thuni&#x27; (meaning cloth), while the &quot;neriyathu&quot; forms the upper garment the mundu.

;Mekhela Sador

Mekhela Sador (Assamese: মেখেলা চাদৰ) is the traditional Assamese dress worn by women. It is worn by women of all ages.

There are three main pieces of cloth that are draped around the body.

The bottom portion, draped from the waist downwards is called the &quot;Mekhela&quot; (Assamese: মেখেলা). It is in the form of a sarong—a very wide cylinder of cloth—that is folded into pleats to fit around the waist and tucked in. The folds are to the right, as opposed to the pleats in the Nivi style of the saree, which are folded to the left. Strings are never used to tie the mekhela around the waist, though an underskirt with a string is often used.

The top portion of the three-piece dress, called the &quot;Sador&quot; (Assamese: চাদৰ), is a long length of cloth that has one end tucked into the upper portion of the Mekhela and the rest draped over and around the rest of the body. The Sador is tucked in triangular folds. A fitted blouse is worn to cover the breasts.

The third piece is called a &quot;Riha&quot;, which is worn under the Sador. It is narrow in width. This traditional dress of the Assamese women is very famous for their exclusive patterns on the body and the border. Women wear them during important religious and ceremonious occasions of marriage. Riha is worn exactly like a Sador and is used as &quot;Orni&quot;.

; Rignai

Rignai is the traditional dress of Tripuri women, the native inhabitants of Tripura. It is worn by wrapping it around the waist. It&#x27;s worn with &quot;Rikutu&quot; which covers the upper half of the body. It is worn by every Tripuri woman in Tripura.

The most significant rignai is called the &quot;Chamathwi bar&quot; and comprises white cloth bordered by maroon or other colors. The &quot;Chamathwi bar&quot; is worn during important occasions like wedding ceremonies and festivals like Goria Puja and Hangrai.

==== Salwar Kameez ====

The salwar is a generic description of the lower garment incorporating the Punjabi salwar, Sindhi suthan, Dogri pajama (also called suthan), and the Kashmiri suthan. The &quot;salwar kameez&quot; has been traditionally worn by the women of the Punjab region and neighbouring areas, including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, where the ensemble has been called the &quot;Punjabi suit&quot;, &quot;salwar suit&quot; or simply &quot;suit&quot;. The Punjabi suit also includes the &quot;churidaar&quot; and &quot;kurta&quot; ensemble which is also popular in Southern India where it is known as the &quot;churidaar&quot;.

The material for the &quot;dupatta&quot; usually depends upon that of the suit and is generally of cotton, georgette, silk, chiffon among others. 

The suthan, similar to the salwar is common in Sindh where it is worn with the cholo and Kashmir where it is worn with the Phiran. The Kashmiri phiran is similar to the Dogri pajama. The patiala salwar is an exaggeratedly wide version of the salwar, its loose pleats stitched together at the bottom.

====Churidaar====

&quot;Churidaar&quot; is a variation on the Punjabi suit which is worn by women across India as casual attire or dressed up for occasions as an alternative to the sari or lehenga choli.

The Punjabi suit trouser, called the salwar and worn in the Punjab regions of India and Pakistan and across Pakistan generally, is baggy and caught in at the ankle.

However the churidaar is tightly fitted especially below the knees. The material for the leg length below the knee is exaggerated so that the material can bunch together at the ankle with horizontal gathers resembling a stack of bangles which are known as ‘churi’ or ‘churiya’. The &quot;churidaar&quot; is worn with an upper garment such as a &quot;kurta&quot; top and the length of this may vary depending on the wearer&#x27;s choice. In India, many churidaar tops resemble the traditional choli as they include a tight-fitting bodice and ties at the back however extra material is added from the end of the choli at the midriff to make a knee-length top, for example. Churidaars are also worn with dupattas, also known as chunnaris.

; Anarkali Suit
The Anarkali suit is made up of a long, frock-style top and features a leggings style bottom. The Anarkali is worn by some women in Northern India and mostly found in Pakistan, and the Middle East. The Anarkali suit varies in many different lengths and embroideries including floor length Anarkali styles. Many women will also opt for heavier embroidered Anarkali suits on wedding functions and events.

Some Indian women wear Anarkali suits on occasions as well such as parties, casual lunches, etc. In India, the Anarkali is sleeveless or with sleeves ranging from cap- to elbow-length.

==== Lehenga Choli (skirt and blouse) ====

A &quot;Ghagra Choli&quot; or a &quot;Lehenga Choli&quot; is the traditional clothing of women in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Some Punjabis also wear them and they are used in some of their folk dances. It is a combination of &quot;lehenga&quot;, a tight &quot;choli&quot; and an &quot;odhani&quot;. A &quot;lehenga&quot; is a form of a long skirt that is pleated. It is usually embroidered or has a thick border at the bottom. A &quot;choli&quot; is a blouse which is cut to fit the body; it is cropped exposing the midriff and is tied at the back with naaris or ties made from the same cloth.

Different styles of &quot;ghagra cholis&quot; are worn by Indian women, ranging from a simple cotton lehenga choli as daily wear, a traditional ghagra with mirrors embellished usually worn during Navratri for the &quot;garba&quot; dance or a fully embroidered lehenga worn during the traditional Hindu and Sikh wedding ceremonies.

Popular among unmarried women other than Gagra choli and Langa voni are kurta tops worn over jeans or light cotton trousers.

; Pattu Pavadai/Reshme Langa

&quot;Pattu Pavadai&quot; or &quot;Langa davani&quot; is a traditional dress in south India, usually worn by teenage and small girls. The &quot;pavada&quot; is a cone-shaped skirt, usually of silk, that hangs down from the waist to the toes. It normally has a golden border at the bottom.

Girls in south India often wear &quot;pattu pavadai&quot; or &quot;Langa davani&quot; during traditional functions.

A version of this is worn by girls in Rajasthan before marriage (and after marriage with sight modification in certain sections of society.)

; Langa - Voni/Dhavani

This is a type of South Indian dress mainly worn in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, as well as in some parts of Kerala. This dress is a three-piece garment where the langa is the cone-shaped long flowing skirt.
== Male clothing ==

=== Traditional clothing ===
For men, traditional clothes are the Achkan/Sherwani, Bandhgala, Lungi, Kurta, Angarkha, Jama, Dhoti or Kurta Pajama. Additionally, recently western clothing such as trousers and shirts have been accepted as traditional Indian dress by the Government of India.

==== Undergarments ====

A kaupinam is unsewn while the langota is a sewn loincloth typically worn as underwear in dangal held in akharas, especially wrestling, in order to prevent hernias and hydrocele.

It is mandatory for Sikhs to wear kacchera.

 It is held in place by a style of wrapping and sometimes with the help of a belt, either as an ornamental and embroidered piece or a flat and simple one, secured around the waist.

Owing to its widespread popularity throughout India, different languages have different terms to describe dhotis. In Marathi, it is called &quot;dhotar&quot;. In Punjabi, it is known as a &quot;chadra.&quot; In Gujarati, it&#x27;s known as &quot;Dhotiyu&quot;, while in Telugu they are called &quot;Pancha.&quot; In Tamil, they are called &quot;veyti,&quot; and over the dhoti, men wear shirts or kurtas.

==== Panche or Lungi ====
A &quot;Lungi&quot; is another traditional garment of India. A &quot;Mundu&quot; is a lungi, except that it is always white. It is either tucked in, over the waist, up to knee-length, or is allowed to lie over and reach up to the ankle. It is usually tucked in when the person is working, in fields or workshops, and left open usually as a mark of respect, in worship places, or when the person is around dignitaries.

Lungis, generally, are of two types: the open lungi and the stitched lungi. The open lungi is a plain sheet of cotton or silk, whereas the stitched one has both of its open ends stitched together to form a tube-like structure.

Though mostly worn by men, elderly women also prefer lungi to other garments owing to its good aeration. It is most popular in south India, though people of Bangladesh, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Somalia also can be seen in lungis, because of the heat and humidity, which create an unpleasant climate for trousers, though trousers have now become common outside the house.

==== Achkan ====
Achkan is a small jacket that usually sports exposed buttons throughout the length of the jacket. The length is usually just at the knees and the jacket ends just below the knee. Achkan is very similar to the Sherwani which is a much longer coat-jacket dress. The jacket has a Nehru collar. The Achkan was mostly worn with tight-fitting pants or trousers called churidars. Achkan is made from various fabrics for both formal and informal occasions. The achkan features traditional Indian embroidery like gota and badla. Achkan was commonly worn by the grooms during wedding ceremonies or other formal festive occasions in the Indian subcontinent but when it evolved into the Nehru Jacket, the achkan became less worn. It was used by men. In India, the achkan is generally worn for formal occasions in winter, especially by those from Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Hyderabad. The achkan later evolved into the Nehru Jacket, which is now popular in India. It may be embroidered with gold or silver. A scarf called a dupatta is sometimes added to the achkan.

====Bandhgala====

A &quot;Jodhpuri&quot; or a &quot;Bandhgala&quot; is a formal evening suit from India. It originated in the Jodhpur State, and was popularized during the British Raj in India. Also known as &quot;Jodhpuri Suit&quot;, it is a western style suit product, with a coat and a trouser, at times accompanied by a vest. It brings together the western cut with Indian hand-embroidery escorted by the Waist coat. It is suitable for occasions such as weddings and formal gatherings.

The material can be silk or any other suiting material. Normally, the material is lined at the collar and at the buttons with embroidery. This can be plain, jacquard, or &quot;jamewari&quot; material. Normally, the trousers match that of the coat. There is also a trend now to wear contrasting trousers to match the coat colour. Bandhgala quickly became a popular formal and semi-formal uniform across Rajasthan and eventually throughout India.

====Angarkha====

The term angarkha is derived from the Sanskrit word , which means protection of the body. The angarkha was worn in various parts of the Indian subcontinent, but while the basic cut remained the same, styles and lengths varied from region to region. Angarakha is a traditional upper garment worn in the Indian subcontinent which overlaps and is tied to the left or right shoulder. Historically, the Angrakha was a court outfit that a person could wrap around himself, offering flexible ease with the knots and ties appropriate for wearing in the various principalities of ancient India.

====Jama====
The jama is a long coat that was popular during the Mughal period. There are many types of jama costumes which were worn in various regions of South Asia, the use of which began to wane by the end of the 19th century A.D. However, men in parts of Kutch still wear the &quot;jama&quot; also known as the angarkha which has an asymmetric opening with the skirt flaring out to around the hips. However, some styles fall to below the knees.

=== Headgear ===
The Indian turban or the &quot;pagri&quot; is worn in many regions in the country, incorporating various styles and designs depending on the place. Other types of headgear such as the Taqiyah and Gandhi cap are worn by different communities within the country to signify a common ideology or interest.

==== Dastar ====
The Dastar, also known as a pagri, is a turban worn by the Sikh community of India. Is a symbol of faith representing values such as valour, honour and spirituality among others. It is worn to protect the Sikh&#x27;s long, uncut hair, the Kesh which is one of the Five Ks of Sikhism. Over the years, the dastar has evolved into different styles pertaining to the various sects of Sikhism such as the Nihang and the Namdhari.

==== Pheta ====

&quot;Pheta&quot; is the Marathi name for turbans worn in the state of Maharashtra. Its usually worn during traditional ceremonies and occasions. It was a mandatory part of clothing in the past and have evolved into various styles in different regions. The main types are the Puneri Pagadi, Kolhapuri and Mawali &quot;pheta&quot;.

==== Mysore Peta ====
Originally worn by the kings of Mysore during formal meeting in durbar and in ceremonial processions during festivals, and meeting with foreign dignitaries, the Mysore peta has come to signify the cultural tradition of the Mysore and Kodagu district. The Mysore University replaced the conventional mortarboard used in graduation ceremonies with the traditional &quot;peta&quot;.

==== Rajasthani safa ====
Turbans in Rajasthan are called &quot;pagari&quot; or &quot;safa&quot;. They are distinctive in style and colour, and indicate the caste, social class and region of the wearer. In the hot and dry regions, turbans are large and loose. The &quot;paggar&quot; is traditional in Mewar while the &quot;safa&quot; is to Marwar. The colour of the &quot;pagaris&quot; have special importance and so does the &quot;pagari&quot; itself. In the past, saffron stood for valour and chivalry. A white turban stood for mourning. The exchange of a turban meant undying friendship.

==== Gandhi topi ====

The Gandhi cap, a white coloured cap made of khadi was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement. The practice of wearing a Gandhi cap was carried on even after independence and became a symbolic tradition for politicians and social activists. The cap has been worn throughout history in many states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal and is still worn by many people without political significance. In 2013, the cap regained its political symbolism through the Aam Aadmi Party, which flaunted Gandhi caps with &quot;I am a Common Man&quot; written over it. This was partly influenced by the &quot;I Am Anna&quot; caps used during Anna Hazare&#x27;s Lokpal movement. During the 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election, these caps led to a scuffle between Aam Aadmi Party and Congress workers, based on the reasoning that Gandhi caps were being used for political benefits.

==== The Kashmir shawl ====

One of India&#x27;s most famous exports was the Kashmir shawl, distinctive for its Kashmiri weave, and traditionally made of &quot;shahtoosh&quot; or &quot;pashmina&quot; wool. Valued for its warmth, lightweight, and characteristic &quot;buta&quot; design, the Kashmir shawl was originally used by Mughal royalty and nobility. In the late 18th century, it arrived in Europe, where its use by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Empress Joséphine of France popularised it as a symbol of exotic luxury and status. It became a toponym for the Kashmir region itself (as cashmere), inspiring mass-produced imitation industries in Europe, and popularising the &quot;buta&quot;, today known as the Paisley motif. Today, it continues to be a symbol of luxury in the Western world, commonly used as a gift to visiting dignitaries and used by public figures.

== Contemporary clothing ==

During the 1960s and 1970s, at the same time as Western fashion was absorbing elements of Indian dress, Indian fashion also began to actively absorb elements of Western dress. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Western designers enthusiastically incorporated traditional Indian crafts, textiles and techniques in their work at the same time as Indian designers allowed the West to influence their work. By the turn of the 21st century, both Western and Indian clothing had intermingled creating a unique style of clothing for the typical urban Indian population. Women started wearing more comfortable clothing and exposure to international fashion led to a fusion of western and Indian styles of clothing. While women have the choice to wear either Western or traditional dress to work, most Indian multinational companies insist that male employees wear Western dress.

Women&#x27;s clothing in India nowadays consists of both formal and casual wear such as gowns, pants, shirts, and tops. Traditional Indian clothing such as the &quot;kurti&quot; have been combined with jeans to form part of casual attire. Fashion designers in India have blended several elements of Indian traditional designs into conventional western wear to create a unique style of contemporary Indian fashion.
