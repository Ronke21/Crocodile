<text>KHNL (channel 13) is a television station in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, serving the Hawaiian Islands as an affiliate of NBC and Telemundo. It is owned by Gray Media alongside CBS affiliate KGMB (channel 5), a combination known as Hawaii News Now. The two stations share studios on Waiakamilo Road in downtown Honolulu; KHNL&#x27;s transmitter is located in Akupu, Hawaii. KHNL is also rebroadcast on the island of Hawaiʻi, Maui, and Kauaʻi.

The present station on channel 13 began broadcasting July 4, 1962, as KTRG-TV, an independent station owned by the Watumull family. In 1967, Richard Eaton&#x27;s United Broadcasting Company purchased the station. The call letters were changed to KIKU-TV and the format to primarily Japanese-language shows. In addition to serving Hawaii&#x27;s Japanese-language community, the station gained notice in the wider market for its telecasts of sumo wrestling as well as &quot;tokusatsu&quot; series, particularly &quot;Android Kikaider&quot; (better known in Hawaii as &quot;Kikaida&quot;).

A general partnership of investors from California and Hawaii, as well as Japan&#x27;s TV Asahi, acquired KIKU-TV in 1979. In 1981, channel 13 significantly reduced its Japanese-language broadcasting, though it continued to air programs in the language into the 1990s, and became a general-entertainment independent. Under the management of future Honolulu mayor Rick Blangiardi, in 1984 the station renamed itself KHNL; it then added coverage of University of Hawaiʻi athletics as well as an affiliation with Fox in 1986. A limited amount of Japanese-language programming continued to air into the early 1990s, shortly after the Providence Journal Company acquired the station.

In 1994, the acquisition of KHON-TV, Honolulu&#x27;s number-one station and an NBC affiliate, by Fox-linked SF Broadcasting portended an affiliation switch, which ultimately took place on January 1, 1996, with KHNL changing from Fox to NBC. As a result, in April 1995, KHNL began airing nightly newscasts. Despite luring several high-profile names in local TV news, the station struggled to gain ratings. Providence Journal merged with Belo Corporation in 1997; Belo then divested KHNL to Raycom Media in 1999. Raycom led the consolidation of KHNL and KGMB&#x27;s news into Hawaii News Now in 2009; the combination became a serious challenger to KHON-TV, primarily on the strength of KGMB&#x27;s existing news viewership. Gray acquired Raycom in 2019.

==Channel 13 in the 1950s==
Channel 13 was the last of Honolulu&#x27;s original five TV allocations to receive any interest, even though channels 2 and 4 each had two applicants. Territorial Telecasters, a group linked to radio woman Christmas Early, filed for the channel in December 1952, only to abandon its bid within months and formally withdraw it in June.

In October 1956, industrialist Henry J. Kaiser applied for channel 13 after also requesting authority to build a new Honolulu radio station. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted a construction permit in December, but this was stayed between January and April 1957 following a protest by KULA-TV (channel 4) on economic grounds.

On May 5, 1957, KHVH-TV began broadcasting on channel 13. Airing from Kaiser&#x27;s Hawaiian Village Hotel, it was the first station to broadcast color television in Hawaii. KHVH-TV was an independent station that lacked network affiliation or even a studio camera; it was primarily a movie station, scheduling three to four feature films a day. In May 1958, Kaiser acquired KULA-TV; the two stations merged as KHVH-TV on channel 4, retaining KULA-TV&#x27;s affiliation with ABC, at midnight on July 15, 1958.

==Early years==
===KTRG-TV: The Watumull years===
David Watumull, through the Hawaiian Paradise Park Corporation, applied for channel 13 in March 1962. Simultaneously, Watumull purchased KOOD (990 AM) and changed its call letters to KTRG.

The construction permit was granted on April 27, 1962, and KTRG-TV began telecasting on July 4, 1962; it was more than five hours later than advertised due to technical difficulties with the transmitter and received an assist from the three other Honolulu TV stations to get on the air the first night. Studios were on Kalakaua Avenue. In addition to syndicated programs, KTRG-TV broadcast some local productions. One of these was high school quiz show &quot;The Challengers&quot;, which debuted in 1963 and was originally moderated by sportscaster Harry Kalas. Another was a local version of the children&#x27;s program &quot;Romper Room&quot;. However, the station lost money and was operating on a part-time basis.

===KIKU-TV: The Japanese-language years===
Watumull filed in January 1966 to sell KTRG-TV to Richard Eaton, owner of the United Broadcasting Company, for an initially agreed sales price of $700,000 (later revised to $550,000); Watumull kept the radio station. Eaton&#x27;s programming plans for channel 13 attracted scrutiny at the FCC, as he sought to convert channel 13 into a station broadcasting Japanese-language programming; In October, the commission designated the deal for a hearing on two issues: the proposed conversion to Japanese-language programming and Eaton&#x27;s past record, as several other United stations had received short-term license renewals. The commission worried that Eaton would have difficulty controlling a station in far-flung Honolulu given the supervision issues that had arisen at other United stations. By January 1967, the station proposed a format consisting of 50 percent Japanese-language and 50 percent English-language programming. With the deal languishing, Hoover Tateishi, a longtime Hawaii broadcaster who had been part of Eaton&#x27;s bid, resigned in order to program two hours a week of Japanese-language programs on channel 13.

While the FCC&#x27;s ruling on the matter was pending, Friendly Broadcasting sued Hawaiian Paradise Park Corporation in May 1967, alleging that Watumull had broken his contract to sell KTRG-TV to Eaton and was talking with another party who wished to buy the station for a greater purchase price. Watumull claimed he was able to do so because the contract lapsed after a year without FCC approval. However, judge Cyrus Nils Tavares issued a ruling that June 30 that the sales contract was still binding. Hearing examiner Thomas Donahue ruled in favor of Eaton&#x27;s purchase of KTRG-TV in July 1967, noting that Eaton&#x27;s poor track record had come from his business model of converting the &quot;dogs and cats&quot; of stations into viable broadcast properties. The sale was then effectuated; after the sale concluded, Hawaiian Paradise Park sued its Washington attorney for malpractice.

Meanwhile, on October 1, KTRG-TV returned to the air as KIKU-TV, with Tateishi as general manager. The new call letters represented the Japanese name for the chrysanthemum flower.

While remaining rooted in Japanese-language programming imported from Japan, KIKU-TV slowly broadened its appeal. In 1968, it began nightly telecasts of sumo wrestling; color telecasting began in 1969. The station introduced subtitles on its Japanese-language programs in 1970, which proved popular and expanded to having half of all programs subtitled by 1975. Another channel 13 specialty was children&#x27;s programming; it aired such &quot;tokusatsu&quot; programs as &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, &quot;Rainbowman&quot;, and &quot;Android Kikaider&quot;. The success of the latter was particularly noteworthy; the show beat &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the ratings, and it was noted in an article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 1971, the station moved from Kalakaua Avenue to studios on Puuhale Road.

==From Japanese to English==
===Mid-Pacific Television Associates ownership===
In 1979, Mid-Pacific Television Associates was approved to buy KIKU-TV for $2.7 million; the general partnership featured two consortia of investors, one local and one headed by the Cushman family of San Diego, as well as Japanese network TV Asahi with a 20 percent stake. Despite the presence of TV Asahi in the ownership group, major changes in 1981 led the station&#x27;s programming away from Japanese-language shows. On June 29, the station doubled the length of its broadcast day and switched to shows mostly in English as Hawaii&#x27;s only general-entertainment independent station. Japanese programming remained at noon and 10 p.m., times when management believed its primarily older viewers would still tune in. The programming change was met with some dismay by senior citizens and the Japanese program at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (UH), but it also was in line with declining Japanese fluency and immigration in Hawaii. A 1998 journal article by Shinji Uozumi suggested that another reason was recent instability in the Japanese yen. Between January 1977 and October 1978, the yen strengthened, going from 271 to the dollar to 176 to the dollar and increasing the prices for Japanese programming as paid by the U.S. station. Joanne Ninomiya, who had been KIKU&#x27;s general manager since 1969, left in January 1981 due to the proposed changes and then began a venture broadcasting Japanese-language shows on cable. In addition to syndicated programming and the remaining Japanese-language shows, channel 13 also began offering newscasts seven days a week on November 1, 1981. It increased its transmitter power, improving its signal. However, some viewers in the Japanese community refused to watch the station after removing much of the programming that catered to their needs. In a show of the impact KIKU had on non-Japanese-speaking viewers, a Hawaiian woman, A. T. Ko-Opuna, started an unsuccessful petition-writing campaign to urge the FCC to support expanded Japanese-language broadcasting on the station.
The largest changes, however, came after Rick Blangiardi, a former University of Hawaiʻi assistant football coach who had worked at KGMB-TV, was named general manager in February 1984. Blangiardi fired 24 employees; he brought with him 13 employees from KGMB and increased the staff size from 48 to 54. The news department was immediately disbanded as a business decision, while programming was upgraded. Blangiardi also changed the station&#x27;s call sign from KIKU-TV to KHNL, after Honolulu&#x27;s airport code. Japanese-language shows continued to air from 10 p.m. to midnight, but other than that, the station was operating as a full-time general-entertainment independent that branded itself as a &quot;news alternative&quot; and the &quot;free movie channel&quot;. KHNL also began a heavy schedule of local sports telecasts, including next-day broadcasts of University of Hawaiʻi football; sports brought viewers and increased advertising revenue. However, the station still lost money because it reinvested its profits in improvements, especially production equipment for remote sports broadcasts.

===King Broadcasting ownership and Fox affiliation===
In February 1986, the King Broadcasting Company of Seattle purchased KHNL from Mid-Pacific Television Associates at a time when the local investors who owned 30 percent of the station were facing financial pressures. It was King Broadcasting&#x27;s first independent station, as it owned three NBC affiliates plus a CBS affiliate on the Mainland. After the King sale, Joanne Ninomiya returned to the station, particularly assisting with the introduction of subtitles to KHNL&#x27;s long-running sumo telecasts. Her JN Productions also supplied six hours of Japanese-language shows on Sundays and a daily newscast from Japan. 

KHNL became Hawaii&#x27;s first affiliate of Fox in October 1986. The station also began expanding its reach with translators on Hawaii&#x27;s other islands; by 1987, it was broadcasting on Maui and Kauaʻi, and in 1989, it began broadcasting its programs on KHBC-TV (channel 2) in Hilo, Hawaii, which King Broadcasting purchased after a previous attempt to operate the station on an independent basis failed the previous year. The Maui translator was replaced with full-power KOGG (channel 15), which began broadcasting from Haleakalā on August 22, 1989.

In 1992, the Providence Journal Company acquired King Broadcasting; Blangiardi, who had been promoted to running Seattle&#x27;s KING-TV in 1989, was fired from his post there immediately. By this time, on the strength of Fox programming and UH athletics, the station was experiencing success. A Nielsen ratings study found it to be the fourth highest-rated independent station in prime time in the United States. Under Providence Journal ownership, the station rebranded to &quot;Fox 13&quot; in January 1993; later that year, it began programming KFVE &quot;K5&quot; (channel 5) under a time brokerage agreement. K5 became the new broadcaster for UH athletics in January 1994, providing additional opportunities for live broadcasts.

Japanese-language programming disappeared from KHNL&#x27;s schedule in 1993 after JN Productions began programming KHAI-TV (channel 20), which already primarily broadcast shows in Japanese, and moved its cable programs there. That station then changed its call sign to KIKU.

==Switch to NBC==
In August 1994, Burnham Broadcasting announced it would sell NBC affiliate KHON-TV (channel 2) and two other stations to SF Broadcasting, a joint venture between Savoy Pictures and Fox (the network owning a voting stock in Savoy), with the stations to switch their affiliations to Fox. However, the deal languished for months at the FCC because NBC was challenging the structure of SF&#x27;s purchase of a fourth Burnham station, WLUK-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin. KHNL announced in early November 1994 that it was setting up a local news department. On November 21, KHNL and NBC reached an affiliation agreement, with the effective date to be determined as part of the Burnham–SF transaction sale process. The news department launched on April 17, 1995, with the station rebranding to &quot;Hawaii News8&quot; and using its cable channel number instead of channel 13. The affiliation switch took place at midnight on January 1, 1996.

In 1997, Belo acquired the Providence Journal Company. However, it found that there was no synergy between KHNL and its clusters of stations in Texas, the Pacific Northwest, and the mid-Atlantic states and put the station up for sale, along with KASA-TV in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in May 1999. The Albuquerque and Honolulu operations were purchased by Raycom Media for $88 million. Raycom president John Hayes was familiar with KHNL, as he had been the vice president of television at the Providence Journal Company prior to its merger with Belo. With the November 1999 legalization of duopolies, Raycom acquired KFVE outright; the deal was approved on December 29, 1999, creating what Raycom called the first legal duopoly in the United States.

Digital broadcasting from KHNL and its satellites began with the launch of digital facilities for KHBC-TV in Hilo in May 2002. KHNL-DT in Honolulu was activated on January 1, 2003. In late 2008, KHNL relocated from its studios on Sand Island Access Road (Route 64/Route 640) and the Puuhale Road offices to a new facility on Waiakamilo Road. The move allowed KHNL to consolidate station operations in one facility; what had been KFVE&#x27;s building prior to the 1993 operating agreement had housed the news department since its launch, while sales and back-office departments worked out of the Puuhale offices. PBS Hawaiʻi then moved into the building.

KHNL, KHBC-TV, and KOGG discontinued analog broadcasting on January 15, 2009, the date on which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts. The transition in Hawaii had been brought forward from the original February 17 national switch date—itself later delayed to June—because of concern that the dismantling of existing transmitter towers atop Haleakalā would affect the mating season of the endangered Hawaiian petrel, which begins in February. All three stations opted to remain on their pre-transition digital channels of 35, 22, and 16, respectively.

==Consolidation with KGMB==
On August 18, 2009, Raycom and MCG Capital Corporation (owner of CBS affiliate KGMB) entered into a shared services agreement (SSA) under which KGMB&#x27;s operations, including its news department, would be combined with KHNL and KFVE in the latter&#x27;s facility. KGMB and KFVE would effectively swap licenses and channel numbers, moving CBS programming to channel 5—which Raycom owned directly—while KFVE would move from channels 5 to 9 and fall under MCG Capital&#x27;s ownership. The move would lead to the elimination of a third of the stations&#x27; combined staff.

The agreement came about primarily for economic reasons. Where the state&#x27;s TV stations had taken in $68 million in revenue in 2008, the Great Recession was predicted to reduce that figure to $48 million in 2009. Raycom president and CEO Paul McTear noted that in light of an &quot;economic reality ... that this market cannot support five traditionally separated television stations, all with duplicated costs&quot;, the agreement would preserve the operations of the three involved stations. He said the SSA would &quot;preserve three stations that provide important and valuable local, national and international programming to viewers in Hawaii&quot;. The combined operation would reduce its headcount from 198 to 130; KGMB&#x27;s management, including general manager Blangiardi, would run KGMB and KHNL. The structure of the deal, particularly the channel 5–9 swap seen as an end-run around a rule that prohibited common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in the market, led to criticism from media watchdog groups and a formal opposition being filed with the FCC. On October 26, 2009, KGMB and KHNL began presenting joint newscasts under the banner &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot;.

In November 2016, the Hawaii News Now stations and Raycom stations in 22 additional markets discontinued use of Nielsen ratings in favor of other methods of audience research. One reason was that, unlike larger Mainland markets, Honolulu was still measured by Nielsen by means of a diary system instead of meters that electronically track ratings habits. Of 11,400 diaries sent out in one Honolulu market survey, only 914 were returned.

===Sale to Gray Television===
On June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom&#x27;s 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including KGMB and KHNL, and Gray&#x27;s 93 television stations) under the former&#x27;s corporate umbrella. In the cash-and-stock merger transaction, valued at $3.6 billion, Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom. Because Raycom operated three stations in the Honolulu market, the companies were required to sell either KHNL, KGMB or KFVE to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules.

On November 1, 2018, Nexstar Media Group (owner of KHNL-TV) announced that it would acquire KFVE and the licenses of former KGMB-TV satellites KGMD-TV and KGMV from American Spirit Media for $6.5 million. However, Raycom retained the K5 brand, call letters, and programming (except for KFVE&#x27;s MyNetworkTV affiliation).

The sale of KFVE to Nexstar was approved by the FCC on December 17; the Gray-Raycom merger was approved three days later. The sale was completed on January 2, 2019. In part because of the merger and with a successor lined up, Blangiardi stepped down from running KGMB and KHNL in 2020 and mounted a successful campaign for mayor of Honolulu.

==News operation==

===Starting a newsroom===
Even prior to signing an affiliation agreement with NBC, KHNL announced in November 1994 its intention to begin producing newscasts sometime in 1995. Providence Journal decided to make KHNL the first tapeless TV newsroom in the United States with all-digital editing equipment. While advertising was run immediately to search for news talent, the station made headlines within weeks by poaching top anchors and reporters from Hawaii&#x27;s other television stations. The first was Dan Cooke, who had been anchoring the news at KITV since 1987. Another KITV employee soon followed: sports director Robert Kekaula, who as part of moving to KHNL would also become a presence on KFVE&#x27;s UH athletics broadcasts. In total, KHON, KITV, and KGMB lost 16 on- and off-air staff to the new KHNL news operation. KHNL leased KFVE&#x27;s Sand Island Road studios from its owner to provide space for the news department.

On April 17, 1995, &quot;Hawaii News8&quot; launched with a prime time newscast at 9 p.m. The program was simulcast on KFVE and featured a fast-paced style. News broadcasts expanded that year with the addition of a 10 p.m. newscast on June 19, followed by the debut of a 5 p.m. newscast on July 24 and a 6 p.m. newscast on November 30. Upon joining NBC, the station added a two-hour weekday morning newscast from 5 to 7 a.m. on January 2, 1996. The station&#x27;s newscasts, however, failed to find ratings success in spite of NBC&#x27;s strength in entertainment programming in the late 1990s. By 1999, both Cooke and Kekaula had returned to KITV. In 2007, even though KFVE was still the official station of UH athletics, KHNL ceased airing regular sports segments in its newscasts and proceeded to lose both of its sportscasters.

KHNL also produced some newscasts specifically for KFVE. When KHNL became an NBC affiliate, K5 exclusively aired the 9 p.m. news, but it was canceled effective August 3, 1997, because of frequent sports preemptions and a lack of ratings and resources. A newscast in that time period was reinstated in 2004, and a 6:30 p.m. newscast on K5 was added in January 2008. On December 22, 2008, with the move to Waiakamilo Road, KHNL became the first television station in Hawaii to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; the KFVE newscasts were included in the upgrade.

===&quot;Hawaii News Now&quot;===

After the consolidation of KGMB and KHNL news was announced, the combined newscast debuted as &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot; on October 26, 2009. The two stations changed the times of some of their early evening newscasts; both stations broadcast at 5 and 10 p.m. with KHNL presenting news at 5:30 and KGMB at 6 p.m. Most of the on-air personalities came from KGMB, with just four KHNL on-air employees remaining with Hawaii News Now. Wayne Harada, writing for &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot;, noted that the choice of KGMB personalities likely owed to the ability to remove highly paid veterans from the combined staff and rely on KGMB&#x27;s superior ratings image.

While the merger of newsrooms created a stronger competitor to KHON-TV in the ratings and sometimes eclipsed it in combined totals, most of the viewership was attributable to KGMB, not KHNL, and the two stations initially carried separate advertising during news simulcasts. KHON was able to claim it had the number one rating at times when KGMB only surpassed it with the addition of KHNL viewers.

==Technical information==
===Satellite stations===

As with other major television stations in Hawaii, KHNL operates satellite stations across the Hawaiian Islands to rebroadcast the station&#x27;s programming outside of metropolitan Honolulu.

KSIX-TV in Hilo and KOGG in Wailuku broadcast KHNL, K5, and KGMB:

KHNL is also rebroadcast on translator K32IX-D in Lihue.

<text>The Montlake Bridge is a double-leaf bascule bridge that carries State Route 513 (Montlake Boulevard) over Seattle&#x27;s Montlake Cut—part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal—connecting Montlake and the University District.

It is the easternmost bridge spanning the canal. The bridge is long, and was designed by Carl F. Gould, one of the original architects of the University of Washington campus. The bridge and its control towers were designed in conjunction with the university&#x27;s Collegiate Gothic style. It provides a clearance of and is reported as providing of vertical clearance above the mean regulated level of Lake Washington for the central of the bascule span. It is one of four original bascule-type drawbridges over the Ship Canal, the others being the Ballard, Fremont, and University bridges. It was the last one to be completed, has the highest clearance of the four, and is the only one that is part of the state highway system. It is also one of six bascule bridges based on a design derived from the Chicago bascule bridge, but is unique because of its trunnion supports, employed to avoid a patent infringement lawsuit by the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company.

==History==

The Montlake Cut was constructed at a narrow isthmus that had been used as an east–west portage by indigenous Coast Salish people; its name in Lushootseed is &quot;stəx̌ʷugʷił&quot; (&quot;carry a canoe&quot;). Plans for a canal to connect Lake Union and Lake Washington emerged as early as the 1860s with the isthmus chosen as the most practical site. A north–south road across the portage was constructed in 1879, while a narrow canal was excavated perpendicular to it. A bridge was constructed over the canal and its set of locks; a larger replacement was later proposed to carry streetcars to the University of Washington campus on the north side in time for the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909. A temporary structure was built for the exposition and replaced with a suspension bridge for foot traffic in 1910 as construction on the wider and deeper Montlake Cut began.

Piers and abutments for a permanent bridge were built in 1914 as part of construction for the Ship Canal, but a serious proposal for a bridge at Montlake didn&#x27;t come until 1916. The first bridge in its place was a makeshift walkway made from a series of barges, set up by graduate manager Dar Meisnest to allow football fans to cross for the Washington/Dartmouth game in 1920. The temporary bridge was so heavily traveled, it demonstrated the need for a permanent structure, which was finished in June 1925. The permanent bridge was opened on June 27, 1925, a month ahead of schedule and as the centerpiece for a local parade that drew thousands of residents. The bridge was constructed by the city of Seattle at a cost of $670,000. The steel was fabricated and erected by the Wallace Equipment Company. A. Munster, acting bridge engineer of the City of Seattle supervised the construction, J. D. Blackwell was city engineer and D. W. McMorris was assistant engineer.

From its opening in 1925 until 1940, public transit across the bridge was provided by streetcars of the Seattle Municipal Street Railway. From 1940 to 1970 and again since 1981, trolleybuses of the Seattle trolleybus system have used the bridge. Since 1984 (with the closure of the 1911 Cambie Street Bridge in Vancouver, Canada), the Montlake Bridge and the nearby University Bridge have been the only movable bridges in the Western Hemisphere still crossed by trolleybuses.

A report from 1993 states that the Montlake Bridge averaged a volume of 60,900 vehicles each weekday, while another report from 2001 puts normal weekend traffic across the bridge at about 40,000 vehicles each day. In addition to the vehicular traffic, the bridge conveys pedestrians and bicyclists across the canal by way of sidewalks on each side of the roadway. The bridge does not open during morning and evening rush hours. It opens at designated times (usually on the hour and half-hour) during the hours just prior to and after rush periods, and on demand at other times. The bridge openings last for an average of four minutes from when traffic stops to when it resumes again. Most of the openings are for sailboats, as most of the tugs that operate this far east are able to pass under the bridge in its closed position. The bridge creates a bottleneck for traffic heading to and from State Route 520 (SR-520), and the creation of alternate routes has been proposed multiple times over the years. Traffic can become backed up for more than a mile when the bridge is open, as can be seen in aerial photographs. Plans to replace SR-520 include adding a second bascule bridge across the Montlake Cut next to the current Montlake Bridge.

===Landmark designations===

The Montlake Bridge is celebrated as the site of boating season&#x27;s &quot;opening day&quot; festivities the first Saturday in May.

The bridge and the Montlake Cut together are a City of Seattle Designated Landmark (ID 107995), and the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, as well as the Washington Heritage Register. It is owned and operated by the Washington State Department of Transportation.

==Navigation==
Montlake Bridge has two traffic lights one on either side of the Montlake Cut. These traffic lights are lit for large commercial traffic and if seen red small vessels need to proceed with caution of oncoming large commercial vessel. Height restriction are listed at at center and all together, with a clearance width of and in the open position. This bridge can be hailed on channel 13 or using appropriate horn request, of one long and one short, for an opening. Normal bridge opening restrictions Monday through Friday except federal holidays differs here than all the rest of the drawbridges on the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

Restrictions are from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. from April 30 to September 1 and from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 3:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. from September 1 to April 30. Additionally, the draw may only open on the top and bottom of the hour from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and from 6:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Further navigation restriction can be found within the Code Federal Regulations and the Notice to Mariners.

<text>KITV (channel 4) is a television station in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, serving the Hawaiian Islands as an affiliate of ABC. It is owned by Allen Media Group alongside multicultural independent station KIKU (channel 20). The two stations share studios on South King Street in downtown Honolulu; KITV&#x27;s main transmitter is located atop the Ala Moana Hotel in Honolulu. Rebroadcasters on the islands of Maui and Hawaii extend the station&#x27;s signal.

Channel 4 was the third station established in Honolulu as KULA-TV in April 1954. It was constructed by Iowa-based American Broadcasting Stations, then-owner of radio station KULA, and affiliated with ABC from the start. Three years later, industrialist Henry J. Kaiser founded the city&#x27;s fourth TV station, KHVH-TV on channel 13. Established in the same year as radio station KHVH (990 AM), it was an independent station that aired primarily movies and brought color television to the islands. Kaiser bought KULA-TV in 1958 and merged the two stations as KHVH-TV on channel 4. Its signal extended with a 1958 affiliation agreement with KMVI-TV, covering Maui from atop Haleakalā, and the 1960 construction of satellite station KHJK-TV—now KHVO—in Hilo on the island of Hawaii.

Kaiser sold KHVH radio and television to Lawrence Berger in 1964 as he sought to move into broadcasting in the continental U.S. KHVH-TV brought Hawaii its first live television via satellite in 1966 and aired the first live programs between Hawaii and Japan. Berger kept KHVH radio and sold the television stations to Starr Broadcasting in 1973; channel 4 was renamed KITV. Under Starr, Shamrock Broadcasting, and Tak Communications ownership for the next 20 years, KITV languished as the market&#x27;s third-rated news station but initiated live coverage of the Merrie Monarch Festival.

Tak wound up a years-long bankruptcy proceeding in 1995 by selling two of its stations, including KITV, to Argyle Television. Argyle—which merged with the Hearst Corporation in 1997 to form Hearst-Argyle Television—improved the quality and ratings of KITV&#x27;s newscasts, which moved into second place from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s. In conjunction with its move from studios on Ala Moana Boulevard to a new facility at One Archer Lane, KITV became the first television station in the United States to begin commercial digital broadcasts in January 1998. Hearst sold KITV to SJL Broadcasting in 2015. It was acquired in 2021 by Allen, which a year later purchased KIKU and restored its traditional format of Japanese- and Filipino-language programming.

==History==
===KULA-TV: Early years===
Channel 4 was one of the first two channels to receive interest after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began taking applications for television stations to serve the Honolulu area on one of five commercial channels (2, 4, 9, 11, and 13). The Advertiser Publishing Company, publisher of the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; newspaper and owner of radio station KGU, applied for channel 4 in early June. Applications quickly piled up, especially for channels 2 and 4 in the low VHF band, seen as most desirable due to their propagation characteristics. Honolulu station KPOA, the Island Broadcasting Company, was the second applicant to seek channel 4. KPOA&#x27;s filing was called in &quot;bad faith&quot; by the &quot;Advertiser&quot;, which pointed out that two other channels were available and had not yet been filed for. KGU and KPOA both bowed out of the channel 4 fight at the same time in March 1953, when they each bought half the stock in Honolulu&#x27;s struggling KONA-TV on channel 11 (which later became KHON-TV on channel 2).

One of the applications for channel 2 came from radio station KULA, which was in competition with a consortium known as Royaltel. KULA was sold in 1953 to American Broadcasting Stations (ABS), the owner of WMT in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which filed in April 1953 for channel 4 in an effort to prevent KGU and KPOA from moving KONA from channel 11 to channel 4. Even while its purchase of KULA was still pending, the FCC granted channel 4 to ABS on May 14, 1953. After the commission approved its acquisition of KULA, it withdrew its application for channel 2 and began scouting studio sites for the new station. Originally designated KABS-TV, the channel became KULA-TV when it was transferred to the same subsidiary as KULA radio, the Pacific Frontier Broadcasting Company.

Construction of KULA-TV&#x27;s studios and original transmitter site on Ala Moana Boulevard began in December 1953; the facilities would accommodate studios for KULA radio. KULA-TV began broadcasting on April 16, 1954. It was an affiliate of the ABC network, whose programs had previously appeared over KGMB-TV; KULA had been an ABC radio affiliate.

The ownership of KULA radio and television shifted several times in its early history. ABS sold the outlets to the Television Corporation of America, a new Hawaiian company headed by Jack Burnett and Albert Zugsmith, in 1955. The Crowell-Collier Publishing Company agreed to purchase all of the outstanding stock in the KULA stations in April 1956, which was canceled four months later when mortgage holders in the firm refused to permit the necessary stock swap.

===KHVH-TV: Kaiser&#x27;s channel 13===

Where channels 2 and 4 both received multiple applications, channel 13 was the last of Honolulu&#x27;s original five TV allocations to receive any interested bidders, possibly because of fear of the number 13. Territorial Telecasters, a group linked to radio woman Christmas Early, filed for the channel in December 1952, only to abandon its bid within months and formally withdraw it in June.

In October 1956, industrialist Henry J. Kaiser applied for channel 13 after also requesting authority to build a new Honolulu radio station. Kaiser had been a dignitary at the launch of KULA-TV two and a half years prior. The FCC granted a construction permit in December, but KULA-TV protested, fearing the Honolulu market could not support an additional station and that it would face negative economic impacts from the sign-on of channel 13.

Hal Lewis, better known on the radio as J. Akuhead Pupule, was the executive vice president of the new Kaiser broadcasting operation in Honolulu. KHVH (990 AM) was approved in February 1957 and began broadcasting on March 15.

The FCC dismissed KULA-TV&#x27;s challenge to the channel 13 permit on April 8, 1957. On May 5, KHVH-TV began broadcasting on channel 13. Airing from Kaiser&#x27;s Hawaiian Village Hotel, it was the first station to broadcast color television in Hawaii. KHVH-TV was an independent station that lacked network affiliation or even a studio camera; it was primarily a movie station, scheduling three to four feature films a day.

===KHVH-TV, channel 4: Merger===
In May 1958, Kaiser announced the acquisition of KULA-TV; he would retain KHVH radio, with KULA being sold off to Jack Burnett. The two television stations merged as KHVH-TV on channel 4, retaining KULA-TV&#x27;s affiliation with ABC and its studios on Ala Moana Boulevard, at midnight on July 15, 1958.

The late 1950s and early 1960s saw KHVH-TV&#x27;s programming expand to the neighbor islands. Channel 4&#x27;s programming began to be seen on Maui on the island&#x27;s first TV station, KMVI-TV (channel 12) in Wailuku. The station, at the time independently owned by the Maui Publishing Company, had rebroadcast KONA-TV programs until KONA-TV set up its own repeater. Kaiser Industries constructed the station at Hilo, KHJK-TV on channel 13, which launched on May 15, 1960, from studios in the Naniloa Hotel.

By 1960, Kaiser&#x27;s interests in Hawaii were diverse and far-reaching. In addition to the KHVH stations and the Hawaiian Village Hotel that was their namesake, he developed Hawaii Kai on eastern Oahu as well as a cement plant and a hospital. His influence led the &quot;Advertiser&quot; to ask in a December 1959 editorial, &quot;Who&#x27;s Running Hawaii?&quot; Kaiser soon cast his gaze to broadcasting on the U.S. mainland. In 1962, he filed for stations in the UHF band in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Burlington, New Jersey, near Philadelphia. His plans called for seven TV stations—the maximum one company could own at the time—with the stations in Honolulu and Hilo counting as two of the seven. 

During Kaiser ownership, the station developed several local programs. Children&#x27;s show &quot;Captain Honolulu&quot; aired from 1959 to 1969; Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Smith served as host under the &quot;Sgt. Sacto&quot; and Captain Honolulu characters before the show came to an end in 1969. Other early local shows included &quot;Kaiser Sports Central&quot;, &quot;50th State Wrestling&quot;, and the &quot;Tom Moffatt Show&quot;. Station manager John Serrao was transferred to Detroit in 1963 to help construct Kaiser&#x27;s WKBD-TV and cited KHVH-TV&#x27;s local programming successes when discussing WKBD&#x27;s planned emphasis on local sports coverage and entertainment.

===Western Telestations, Starr, and Shamrock ownership===
Kaiser Industries announced the creation of Kaiser Broadcasting, a dedicated subsidiary of the company, to house the firm&#x27;s broadcasting interests in September 1964. The KHVH stations would not be among them for long. That October, Kaiser announced the $3 million sale of the KHVH stations and KHJK-TV to Lawrence S. Berger, who had experience running stations in Wyoming and Montana. The transaction also included a construction permit for an FM radio station. The acquisition of KHVH-TV and KHVO—the former KHJK—by Berger&#x27;s company, Western Telestations, was completed in December.

KHVH-TV was the first Hawaiian television station to air live pictures from the continental United States. Using the Lani Bird satellite, channel 4 brought viewers a college football game between Michigan State and Notre Dame on November 19, 1966. During halftime, viewers in the U.S. saw sunbathers on Waikiki&#x27;s beaches; in addition, KHVH fed film from the Vietnam War to the ABC and NBC networks. KHVH-TV also originated the first live broadcast from Hawaii to Japan and aired the first live television program produced in Japan to be seen in Hawaii, as well as nationally-aired coverage of ceremonies commemorating the 25th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Berger accepted an offer from the Starr Broadcasting Company of New Orleans to sell KHVH-TV in March 1971; Berger would have bought KHVH radio from Western Telestations in a concurrent transaction. The deal fell apart that August, but Starr agreed to acquire KHVH-TV in November 1972. The sale closed on August 1, 1973; with the KHVH stations now under separate owners, channel 4 changed its call sign to KITV, for Island Television. Berger would later regret not holding on to the television stations; in 1979, he said, &quot;It was a mistake as far as money, at least. Who knew ABC would end up with &quot;Happy Days&quot; instead of the junk stuff we had in those days?&quot;

Under Starr, two changes were made in KITV&#x27;s transmission setup. In early 1977, channel 4 switched to an antenna atop the Ala Moana Hotel, which improved reception for viewers in Waikiki shaded from the original tower by a new condominium building but not some viewers on windward Oahu. The company purchased KMVI-TV on Maui from its owner, Pacific Media Group, in 1978; it changed its call sign to KMAU after the sale.

The Starr stations were acquired by Shamrock Broadcasting, a company founded by Roy E. Disney, in a deal announced in May 1978 and approved by the FCC in May 1979. The merger of Starr and Shamrock came after LIN Broadcasting made a higher offer that required more divestitures, with the two satellite stations of KITV a complicating factor. Under Shamrock, KITV endured a two-month-long strike by the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) that began on November 3, 1980. On that date, eight on-camera employees walked off the job, claiming that general manager Dick Grimm had refused contract negotiations for four years. During the strike, public officials including governor George Ariyoshi, Honolulu mayor Frank Fasi, and other state and city leaders refused to speak to reporters from KITV, and the city prosecutor filed a complaint in district court accusing the station of hiring strikebreakers. Shamrock planned new studio facilities for KITV in 1986, but they were not built, and the station remained on Ala Moana Boulevard, where the station televised the annual Aloha Festivals parade as it passed by.

Grimm brought many local broadcasts to KITV. In the mid-1970s, University of Hawaii Rainbow Wahine women&#x27;s volleyball was added to the station&#x27;s lineup at a time when the team was among the top squads in the nation. A University of Hawaii football game aired in 1974 as a favor for the ailing governor, John A. Burns; the university arranged telling the NCAA that the game was a sellout as required by television rules of the time to allow Burns to see the game on TV. Most notable, however, was the Merrie Monarch Festival in Hilo; Grimm successfully petitioned organizer Dottie Thompson, initially reticent, to allow a telecast. Originally in the form of an edited highlight package, live coverage debuted in 1984, and KITV held the rights to the festival through 2009, after which it was outbid by KFVE.

===Tak ownership===
Shamrock was not planning to sell KITV but received and accepted a $50 million offer from Tak Communications, owner of television stations in Wisconsin and a radio station in Illinois, in 1986. One of the first changes under the new ownership was the switch to same-day broadcast of prime time entertainment series and soap operas with stations in the continental U.S., a practice that KGMB and KHON had adopted with CBS and NBC programming three years earlier. KITV did not switch at that time because of the cost of equipment to receive and delay the satellite feed for later rebroadcast.

Tak nearly sold KITV to Anthony Cassara, a television executive who had made several attempts in preceding years to buy Hawaii TV stations, in 1989; the company agreed in June to sell 60 percent of the station to a firm headed by Cassara, but the deal fell apart in October as the buyers were unable to secure financing.

Tak Communications struggled financially for a significant portion of its time owning KITV, having overpaid in a hot market for stations. In October 1990, its lenders—a group of East Coast banks—sued to force the appointment of a receiver. After reaching an accord with the lenders, Tak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 1991. During bankruptcy, the station remained profitable and, with bankruptcy court approval, bought new equipment and replaced the roof on its studios. Tak&#x27;s creditors sought in December 1992 to take control of the company; Michael Eskridge, the founder of CNBC, became the operating agent. The original reorganization plan failed when the FCC did not approve the transfer, possibly because of objections filed to the transfer of the four Tak TV stations in Wisconsin.

===Argyle/Hearst ownership===
Argyle Television II offered $146 million and received court approval to purchase KITV ($51 million) and WGRZ-TV in Buffalo, New York, from Tak in February 1995. The bid for KITV beat out a $50 million offer by Freedom Communications. In August 1997, Argyle merged with the Hearst Corporation&#x27;s broadcasting unit to form what was then known as Hearst-Argyle Television. The name continued until 2009, when the Hearst Corporation acquired Argyle&#x27;s stake in the venture, took it private, and renamed it Hearst Television.

Argyle began planning to move the station to more modern quarters. In 1998, KITV moved its operations from its longtime studios on Ala Moana Boulevard to its current location on South King Street (also known as One Archer Lane). The new facility, set up at a cost of $15 million, contained equipment sufficient to begin commercial digital broadcasting. From the start, Argyle opted to equip the facility with serial digital video connections, and as planning continued, the company opted to take the plunge with digital transmission. On January 15, 1998, KITV began airing a digital signal, giving it a claim to be the first U.S. TV station to commercially broadcast in the new format. KHVO in Hilo was the first station to be awarded a regular commercial construction permit for digital operations. KMAU also began broadcasting a digital signal, which was temporarily turned off to resolve interference issues with nearby scientific instruments. A second digital subchannel was configured but only broadcast color bars.

In 1999, KHON and KITV abandoned the practice known as &quot;Hawaii time&quot;, where additional commercials were inserted into prime time but shows did not start on time, in favor of &quot;clock time&quot;, where shows started at the same time they would on a U.S. mainland station. The practice had originated when entertainment programs were still taped and shipped to Hawaii for rebroadcast; the commercials defrayed the cost of transporting network material. By the late 1990s, it was causing advertising prices to be cheaper than otherwise. The switch to clock time had little effect on KHON and KITV, then the top two news stations in Honolulu, which remained in their ratings positions. All four network affiliates had adopted clock time by December 2002.

KITV, KHVO, and KMAU discontinued analog broadcasting on January 15, 2009, the date on which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts. The transition in Hawaii had been brought forward from the original February 17 national switch date—itself later delayed to June—because of concern that the dismantling of existing transmitter towers atop Haleakalā would affect the mating season of the endangered Hawaiian petrel, which begins in February. KITV&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 40, KHVO&#x27;s digital signal relocated from channel 18 to channel 13, and KMAU&#x27;s digital signal relocated from channel 29 to channel 12; all three stations switched to using virtual channel 4.

===SJL and Allen ownership===
On May 13, 2015, Hearst announced that it would sell KITV and its satellites to SJL Broadcasting; the deal marks the return of the company to Hawaii, as SJL (then known as Montecito Broadcast Group) formerly owned KHON-TV from 2006 until 2007. The sale was approved by the Federal Communications Commission on July 10, 2015, and completed on September 1, 2015. SJL sold the One Archer Lane studio site in 2016 under a long-term leaseback arrangement.

As a result of the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction, KITV relocated its signal from channel 40 to channel 20 on April 12, 2019.

The $30 million sale of KITV to Los Angeles–based Allen Media Group, owned by Byron Allen, was announced on August 17, 2020, and completed on January 20, 2021. In 2022, Allen acquired KIKU (channel 20), a station that had traditionally broadcast Japanese- and Filipino-language programming but had been converted by its ownership to rebroadcasting the ShopHQ home shopping network in spite of public outcry. The sale was completed on January 31, 2022. The new ownership restored the prior format and about 75 percent of the previously aired programming.

== News operation ==
KULA-TV had newscasts from the start, with John Needham and John Galbraith as the station&#x27;s first news presenters. In 1959, under Kaiser, channel 4 was the first local station with same day news images, utilizing wire service photos fed by the International News Service; the other stations had to wait a day to process newsfilm. Present from the start of the station, initially as production manager, was Bob Sevey. Sevey left the station in 1957 to work for an ad agency, returned in 1961 as a news anchor, and departed in 1965 after Cecil Heftel poached him to run the KGMB-TV newsroom, where he immediately led that station to number one in the ratings. In the late 1960s, the station&#x27;s news team featured Chuck Henry, who later went on to a career as an anchor in Los Angeles; Ken Kashiwahara, who spent 25 years as a correspondent for ABC News; and sportscaster Al Michaels. When Henry left for KABC-TV in 1971, his replacement was state senator Mason Altiery. The station sank to third in the ratings. In 1975, it tried a team consisting entirely of local newscasters; in the &quot;Advertiser&quot;, Bill Mann wrote that the newscasts were an &quot;embarrassment&quot;, awkward, and riddled with mistakes. Two reporters, Don Baker and Tom McWilliams, sued, alleging they were fired for being White at a time when the station wanted a more diverse news team; a federal judge ruled against the lawsuit. Altiery, who at various times served as the news director of each of KHON-TV, KGMB-TV, and KHVH-TV, returned to channel 4 from 1975 to 1976.

Later in the 1970s, after the Shamrock purchase, KITV invested $1 million in improvements to its newscasts. It hired Jack Hawkins, a news anchor unfavorably compared by many to the fictional Ted Baxter and suffering from a credibility gap as a non-local newsman. From 1982 to 1984, KITV briefly presented its evening news at 5:30 and 9:30 p.m. while KGMB and KHON fought for viewers at 6 and 10; this arrangement was replaced with a more conventional late news schedule at 10 p.m. In 1987, KITV debuted a midday newscast. No matter the newscasts, the KITV news department was hemmed in by a smaller budget and staff than the other stations; in 1987, the station had an annual news budget of $1.1 million and 27 news employees, whereas KHON had a news budget of $1.9 million and 40 news staffers. After the 1980 strike, the station became a non-union shop and consequently offered lower pay to its workers, which resulted in higher turnover. Anchor Tina Shelton, who moved from KGMB to KITV in 1985 and remained at the station through 1999, commented that the reduced resources led KITV&#x27;s newscasts to concentrate on police, courts, and government reporting. In 1989, when Anthony Cassara was under contract to buy KITV, he called it &quot;under-managed&quot;.

The 1990s saw KITV become more competitive head-to-head with its rivals. In 1992, the station dropped its 5:30 p.m. early news and replaced it with separate 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts; it debuted a two-hour morning newscast in January 1996. The 5 p.m. newscast—anchored by the husband-and-wife team of Gary Sprinkle and Pamela Young—was a ratings success for the station; Young brought her &quot;Mixed Plate&quot; travel and features series with her to channel 4. In the first two decades of the program, which aired at one point or another on KHON, KGMB, and KITV, Young had produced 80 specials.

Overall, KITV moved from third place to second behind leader KHON, where it remained into the early 2000s as KGMB and KHNL inched closer. KGMB overtook KITV in late news by 2004, on its way to unseating KHON as the leading 10 p.m. newscast in 2006 for the first time in two decades. By 2015, the station&#x27;s ratings had fallen further, with less than half the late news viewership of Hawaii News Now or KHON. &quot;Mixed Plate&quot; ended its run in 2016 after Young left the station to rejoin KHON.

In the wake of the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake on the island of Hawaii, KITV was unable to broadcast its signal but began producing and streaming its newscast online, the only local station able to do so. The stream received hundreds of thousands of views from around the world and was redistributed by the CNN Pipeline video news service. In 2010, the station added additional weekend morning and early evening newscasts.

By 2023, KITV produced hours a week of local news programs.

On January 17, 2025, Allen Media Group announced plans to cut local meteorologist/weather forecaster positions from its stations, including KITV, and replacing them with a &quot;weather hub&quot; produced by The Weather Channel, which AMG also owns. The decision was reversed within a week by management in response to &quot;viewer and advertiser reaction&quot;.

<text>George Bannerman Dealey (September 18, 1859 – February 26, 1946) was a Dallas, Texas, businessman. Dealey was the long-time publisher of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; and owner of the A. H. Belo Corporation. A plaza in Dallas is named in his honor and became instantly world-famous when it was the site of the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.
==Childhood==
Dealey was born on September 18, 1859, at the home of his parents, George Dealey (1829–1894) and Mary Ann Nellins (1829–1913), on Queen St., Rusholme, Manchester, England. He was the fifth of 10 children.

In the mid-1860s the family moved to Liverpool, England, where he began his schooling and worked as a grocer&#x27;s apprentice. In 1870 his family immigrated to Galveston, Texas, where he continued in public school and worked at various odd jobs.

==Newspaper career==
On October 12, 1874, Dealey assumed an older brother&#x27;s job as an office boy at &quot;The Galveston News&quot; at $3.00 per week, for the owner, Alfred H. Belo. Dealey took evening classes at the Island City Business College and rose steadily at the News. As a traveling correspondent, he sent both news stories and newspaper-business reports back to Galveston.

In 1884, Dealey determined that Dallas would be the best market for a new Belo company newspaper. In 1885, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; debuted. He became the paper&#x27;s manager in 1895, a board member in 1902, vice president and general manager of the corporation in 1906, and president in 1919.

Dealey refused advertising that he considered dishonest or immoral, including ads for hard liquor. He refused ads for oilfield ventures since he could not determine which were sound businesses. The News also opposed the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s influence in the 1920s.

Dealey also owned the &quot;G. B. Dealey Land Co.&quot; and the &quot;West Commerce Realty Co.&quot; He founded an early newspaper-owned radio station, WFAA, in 1922.

In 1926, Dealey bought &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, the &quot;Journal&quot; (an evening edition), the &quot;Semi-Weekly Farm News&quot;, and the &quot;Texas Almanac&quot; from the heirs of A. H. Belo, along with a majority of the company stock.

==Civic activities==
Under Dealey, the News was enlisted in the cause of civic planning. A campaign of 1899 led to the foundation of the &quot;Cleaner Dallas League&quot;, which became the &quot;Dallas Civic Improvement League&quot; in 1902. He was instrumental in the adoption of the 1910 Kessler Plan to improve Dallas and provide for its growth.

Dealey helped establish Southern Methodist University and was instrumental in bringing a Federal Reserve branch to Dallas.

Dealey served on the board of governors of the American City Planning Institute (1920–21), as vice president of the National Municipal League (1923–24), on the advisory council of the American Planning and Civic Association, and on the national committee of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation. He was a director of the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Texas and was president of the Family Bureau, a Dallas social agency, from its inception in 1908. He was also president of the &quot;Philosophical Society of Texas&quot;, a member of the &quot;Texas Press Association&quot;, an honorary life member of the Texas State Historical Association, founder (1922) and lifetime president (from 1933) of the Dallas Historical Society, and second vice president of the Associated Press (1923–24).

Dealey had honorary roles with Sigma Delta Chi (1940–41) and Phi Beta Kappa (1943). He received honorary doctoral degrees from Southern Methodist University (1921), Austin College (1924), and the University of Missouri (1925), the last of which invited him to accept a gift to its school of journalism from the British Empire Press Union.

Dealey Plaza in Downtown Dallas was named for him upon commencement of its construction in 1934 (for the 1936 Texas Centennial). He initially thought to decline the honor, but was persuaded to accept it by his son. A of G.B. Dealey was made and erected in Dealey Plaza in 1949.

==Personal life==
Dealey married Olivia Allen at her home in Lexington, Missouri, on April 9, 1884. She was born in Lexington on November 14, 1863, and died at her home in Dallas on January 28, 1960. Allen had succeeded her husband as chairman of the board of A. H. Belo Corporation and was serving in that capacity when she died.

The Dealeys had three daughters and two sons. The sons were Walter Allen Dealey and Edward Musgrove (Ted) Dealey. Ted Dealey succeeded his father as publisher of the &quot;Morning News&quot; and became known for his strident conservatism and anti-communism. A younger brother, James Q. Dealey (1861–1937), was a professor of political science at Brown University and later editor of the &quot;Morning News&quot;. A nephew, Samuel David Dealey (1906–1944), was a World War II naval submarine officer who received the Medal of Honor and for whom the USS Dealey (DE-1006) was named. Another grandson, Dr. Walter Allen (Al) Dealey Jr. became a Christian minister and studied under Norman Vincent Peale.

Robert Decherd, CEO of A. H. Belo Corporation from 1987 to 2013, and James M. Moroney III, Belo CEO from 2013 to 2018, are each Dealey&#x27;s great-grandson. 

Dealey was a thirty-third-degree Scottish Rite Mason, Knight Templar, Shriner, and member of the Red Cross of Constantine. He was a Presbyterian and Democrat. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him the &quot;dean of American newspaper publishers&quot; for his 71 consecutive years of service to a single newspaper.

Dealey was still working as a publisher when he died of a massive coronary occlusion at his Dallas home, February 26, 1946, at the age of 86. He was buried in Grove Hill Cemetery in Dallas.

==Legacy==
* The Dallas Independent School District (DISD) operates George Bannerman Dealey Montessori School, an elementary school named for him in the Preston Royal area of North Dallas.
* In 2021, the Belo Center for New Media on the UT Austin campus was renamed the G. B. Dealey Center for New Media to honor his legacy as &quot;a legend in journalism and media.&quot;
* A statue of Dealey was erected in Dealey Plaza in 1949, three years after his death.

<doc id="845099" wikidata="Q74665" url="?curid=845099" title="Sternoptychidae">
<text>The [[marine hatchetfish]]es or deep-sea hatchetfishes as well as the related [[bottlelight]]s, [[pearlside]]s and [[constellationfish]]es are small deep-sea ray-finned fish of the stomiiform family Sternoptychidae. They are not closely related to and should not be confused with the freshwater hatchetfishes, which are teleosts in the characiform family Gasteropelecidae. The Sternoptychidae have 10 genera and about 70 species altogether.

The scientific name means &quot;&quot;Sternoptyx&quot;-family&quot;, from &quot;Sternoptyx&quot; (the type genus) + the standard animal family suffix &quot;-idae&quot;. The type genus derives from Ancient Greek &quot;stérnon&quot; (στέρνον, &quot;breast&quot;) + &quot;ptýx&quot; (πτύξ, &quot;a fold/crease&quot;) + Latin &quot;forma&quot; (&quot;external form&quot;), the Greek part in reference to the thorax shape of marine hatchetfishes.

==Description and ecology==
Found most often at depths of 200–600 meters in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, marine hatchetfishes range in size from &quot;Polyipnus danae&quot; at to the c.-long giant hatchetfish (&quot;Argyropelecus gigas&quot;).

The members of the disputed subfamily Maurolicinae have a more conventional fish shape. The mouth is located at the tip of the snout and directed downwards, more so in the Sternoptychinae.

Unlike other Stomiiformes, they still have fully developed pseudobranchs. Their branchiostegal rays are 6–10, three of them attach to the posterior ceratohyal (epihyal). Their bodies are covered in delicate silvery scales which abrade easily. In some species, such as the Highlight Hatchetfish (&quot;Sternoptyx pseudobscura&quot;), large sections of the body at the base of the anal fin and/or caudal fin are transparent. The anal fin has 11–38 rays and may be divided in two parts. An adipose fin is usually present. The Sternoptychinae have preopercular spines and blade-like pterygiophores in front of the dorsal fin. Their large, sometimes tube-shaped eyes can collect the faintest of light and focus well on objects both close and far. In many genera, the eyes are fixed gazing permanently upwards, enabling them to discern the silhouettes of prey moving overhead against the slightly brighter upper waters.

Sternoptychidae undertake nightly mass migrations from depths of 3,600 metres to the upper 50–100 metres of the starlit water column. There they feed throughout the night, returning to the depths by daybreak. Their prey consists primarily of tiny crustaceans, such as amphipods, copepods, euphausiids (krill) and ostracods (seed shrimp), and of fish smaller than themselves. What little is known of their life cycle suggests that at least some members of this family are short-lived, dying after no more than a year. They spawn in the open water, and do not guard or otherwise care for their offspring; species with a short lifespan are presumably semelparous The fry – even of Sternoptychinae – look like tiny pearlsides (&quot;Maurolicus&quot;).

===Bioluminescence===
Marine hatchetfishes are not the only animals that seek out prey by watching for silhouettes from below. Indeed, many fishes that consider Sternoptychidae prey do so, and to foil their predaceous attempts, the Sternoptychidae have evolved an astounding ability: bioluminescent counter-illumination.

Counterillumination (or counter-lighting) involves the production of light by the fish for the purpose of camouflaging its silhouette from observers lurking below. Sternoptychidae produce this light with organs called photophores, of which they have between 3 and 7 – usually 6 – on the branchiostegal membrane along the lower edge of the chest and belly. The intensity of the light produced is controlled by the fish, an appropriate brightness chosen according to how much light reaches the eyes from above. The patterns of light created by the photophores are also unique to each species, probably playing a role in courtship.

==Systematics==
The Sternoptychidae belong to the order Stomiiformes, which is often placed in the teleost superorder Stenopterygii, usually together with the Ateleopodiformes (jellynoses), but sometimes on their own. But it may well be that the closest living relatives of the &quot;Stenopterygii&quot; are found among the superorder Protacanthopterygii, and that the former would need to be merged in the latter. In some classifications, the &quot;Stenopterygii&quot; are kept separate but included with the Protacanthopterygii and the monotypic superorder Cyclosquamata in an unranked clade called Euteleostei. That would probably require splitting two additional monotypic superorders out of the Protacanthopterygii, and thus result in a profusion of very small taxa.

The Stomiiformes have also been considered close relatives of the Aulopiformes. The latter are otherwise placed in a monotypic superorder &quot;Cyclosquamata&quot; but also appear to be quite close to the Protacanthopterygii indeed. The relationships of these – and the Lampriformes or Myctophiformes, which are also usually treated as monotypic superorders – to the taxa mentioned before is still not well resolved at all, and regardless whether one calls them Protacanthopterygii &quot;sensu lato&quot; or Euteleostei, the phylogeny of this group of moderately advanced Teleostei is in need of further study.

The ancestral Stomiiformes probably resembled the Gonostomatidae, with thin brownish bodies, rows of egg-shaped photophores adorning the lower body parts, and mouths with numerous teeth. The family Gonostomatidae is the closest living relative of the Sternoptychidae, and these two form the suborder Gonostomatoidei. Indeed, some Sternoptychidae are called &quot;bristlemouths&quot;, like the bulk of the Gonostomatidae. Compared to their relatives, the marine hatchetfishes are a more apomorphic group, but they have evolved in an entirely different direction from the other &quot;advanced&quot; lineage of Stomiiformes, the huge family Stomiidae.

===Classification===
Typically, the Sternoptychidae are divided into two subfamilies, with the more plesiomorphic members making up the Maurolicinae. Symplesiomorphies are no reliable indicator of actual relationships, however. While it remains to be seen what Sternoptychidae other than the pearlsides (&quot;Maurolicus&quot;, the type genus) do actually belong in the Maurolicinae, it is unlikely that the two-subfamily arrangement is correct. It may even be that the Maurolicinae are just an indiscriminate assemblage of unrelated basal Sternoptychidae and are altogether invalid. The Sternoptychinae – the &quot;true&quot; marine hatchetfishes – on the other hand are monophyletic.

The provisional arrangement of subfamilies and genera of Sternoptychidae is as follows:
* Genus †&quot;Eknomodophos&quot; (Oligocene of North Caucasus, Russia)
* Genus †&quot;Xenomesopelagia&quot; (Oligocene of Poland)
* Subfamily Maurolicinae
** Genus &quot;Araiophos&quot; (2 species)
** Genus &quot;Argyripnus&quot; – bristle-mouth fishes (6 species)
** Genus &quot;Danaphos&quot; – bottlelights (1–2 species)
** Genus †&quot;Jerzmanskaephos&quot; (Oligocene of Poland)
** Genus &quot;Maurolicus&quot; – pearlsides (15 species)
** Genus &quot;Sonoda&quot; (2 species)
** Genus &quot;Thorophos&quot; (2 species)
** Genus &quot;Valenciennellus&quot; – constellationfishes (2 species)
* Subfamily Sternoptychinae – marine hatchetfishes, deep-sea hatchetfishes
** Genus &quot;Argyropelecus&quot; – silver hatchetfishes (7 species)
** Genus &quot;Polyipnus&quot; (32 species)
** Genus &quot;Sternoptyx&quot; (4 species)
** †&quot;Discosternon&quot; (Miocene of Italy)
** †&quot;Eosternoptyx&quot; (middle-late Eocene of Iran)
** †&quot;Horbatshia&quot; (Oligocene of Poland)
** †&quot;Polyipnoides&quot; (middle Eocene of Georgia)

<text>Tony Lorenzo Delk (born January 28, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player and college assistant coach. He last served as an assistant coach for the New Mexico State Aggies men&#x27;s basketball team. During his playing days, he was team leader of the Kentucky Wildcats team that won the 1996 NCAA Championship Game. After college, he played for eight National Basketball Association (NBA) teams over 10 seasons.

==High school==
Delk attended Haywood Junior High School and Haywood High School in Brownsville, Tennessee. During his 1992 senior year of high school, Delk was named &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot; in the state of Tennessee (TSSAA Class 3A Mr.Basketball 1992) and also to the &quot;Parade&quot; and McDonald&#x27;s All-American Teams.

==College career==

As a sophomore at Kentucky, Delk was voted All-SEC 2nd Team by the coaches and All-SEC 3rd Team by the Associated Press, while also making the All-SEC Tournament Team for his outstanding play. Delk was named to the All-SEC 1st and All-NCAA Regional teams during the 1994–95 season. In the 1995–96 season, Delk was named to the All-American and All-SEC first teams and was named NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player. He also received SEC Player of the Year honors during the season. Delk joined Omega Psi Phi Fraternity while at Kentucky.

==Playing career==

Tony Delk was picked 16th overall in the 1996 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. He was traded by the Hornets along with Muggsy Bogues to the Golden State Warriors for B. J. Armstrong on November 7, 1997, where he played for two seasons before signing with the Sacramento Kings on August 16, 1999. He appeared in 46 games in 1999-00, subsequently joining the Phoenix Suns on August 1, 2000.

In a January 2, 2001, overtime game against the Kings, he scored a career-high 53 points on 20-for-27 field goal shooting. This was the only game of Delk&#x27;s career in which he scored 30 or more points. Delk was eventually dealt with Rodney Rogers to the Celtics, for Joe Johnson, Milt Palacio, and Randy Brown.

On October 20, 2003, Delk was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, along with Antoine Walker for Chris Mills, Jiří Welsch, Raef LaFrentz, and a 2004 first-round pick. After a year with the Mavericks, Delk and Walker were again traded, in a deal for Jason Terry and Alan Henderson. Delk lasted one and a half seasons with the Hawks before being waived on February 25, 2006, signing with the Detroit Pistons on March 1, where he backed up point guard Chauncey Billups.

Delk finished his NBA career with averages of 9.1 PPG, 2.5 RPG and 1.9 APG as he, in August 2006, signed a contract with the Greek basketball team, Panathinaikos, in Athens. He won the Greek Cup, the Greek Championship and the European Championship with Panathinaikos, but was released in May 2007, citing compatibility issues. He announced his retirement from professional basketball in November 2007. In 2008, nonetheless, he played three games for the Gigantes de Carolina in the BSN, the professional basketball league of Puerto Rico. He retired, once again, and served as a technical assistant with the same team.

==Coaching career==

On April 16, 2009, it was announced that Delk would be returning to his alma mater along with his former college teammate Scott Padgett to serve on coach John Calipari&#x27;s staff at the University of Kentucky.

In July 2011, the New Mexico State Aggies basketball team hired him as an assistant coach to Marvin Menzies.

In June 2013, Delk left the New Mexico State staff to pursue other opportunities closer to his family in Atlanta.

==Broadcasting career==
In October 2014, the SEC Network announced Delk had been hired as an in-studio analyst and announcer for the upcoming college basketball season.

==Personal life==
Tony Delk is the president of the Taylor Delk Sickle Cell Foundation. The foundation is named after his daughter, who has sickle cell disease.

Delk divorced from his former wife, Margie Delk, in 2007.

<text>A cabinet reshuffle or shuffle occurs when a head of government rotates or changes the composition of ministers in their cabinet, or when the head of state changes the head of government and a number of ministers. They are more common in parliamentary systems than in systems where cabinet heads must be confirmed by a separate legislative body, and occur frequently in autocratic systems.

A shadow cabinet reshuffle may take place to change positions in a shadow cabinet.

==In parliamentary systems==
Cabinet reshuffles happen in parliamentary systems for a variety of reasons. Periodically, smaller reshuffles are needed to replace ministers who have resigned, retired or died. Reshuffles are also a way for a head of government to &quot;refresh&quot; the government, often in the face of poor polling numbers; remove poor performers; and reward supporters and punish others. It is common after elections, even if the party in power is retained, as the prime minister&#x27;s reading of public opinion as evidenced by the election may require some change in policy, in addition to any changes resulting from the retirement or defeat of individual ministers at the election. Similarly, prime ministers entering office from the same party as the previous one might appoint a very different ministry than their predecessor to reflect a change in policies and priorities; an example is Gordon Brown&#x27;s government, formed on 28 June 2007 after the departure of Tony Blair the previous day.

A reshuffle also provides an opportunity to create, abolish and rename departments (and ministerial posts), and to reassign responsibilities among departments. This may be done to reflect new priorities or for reasons of efficiency.

==In other democratic systems==
Cabinet reshuffles are far less common in systems where members of the cabinet are not drawn from the legislative branch. In such systems there is a far larger pool of viable candidates to choose a cabinet from. Members of such cabinets are usually chosen on account of their qualifications to run a specific portfolio, so moving these cabinet members to different portfolios at a later time usually makes little sense. 

In the United States (a presidential system), it would be very unusual for a president to reassign multiple cabinet secretaries to new positions, especially since a U.S. cabinet member moved to a new position within the cabinet needs to be confirmed in the new role by the United States Senate—this alone is seen as a powerful deterrent against U.S. presidents initiating major cabinet reshuffles. On an individual basis, however, U.S. cabinet members will occasionally change departments—for example, Federico Peña served as Secretary of Transportation from 1993 until 1997 in the Clinton administration and was appointed as Secretary of Energy directly afterwards, serving until 1998. Likewise Norman Mineta served as Secretary of Commerce under Bill Clinton before becoming Secretary of Transportation for Clinton&#x27;s successor, George W. Bush.

In France (a semi-presidential system within the framework of the contemporary French Fifth Republic), the prime minister may tender their resignation to the president of the Republic, who then selects a successor. The new prime minister then proposes a list of ministers to the president, who may approve the list or request changes. After the list is approved, the new government is put in office. The same practice may be used to change several ministers in one sweep while retaining the same prime minister, in which case the president simply selects the incumbent as their own successor. Such successive governments with one same prime minister are named after the head of government and numbered (for instance &quot;Rocard I and &quot;Rocard II&quot; or &quot;Ayrault I and Ayrault II&quot;).

==In undemocratic systems==
Cabinet reshuffles occur at the pleasure of monarchs or dictators in autocratic systems, which lack the checks-and-balances of systems with greater citizen or legislative control.

<text>Ancrene Wisse (; also known as the Ancrene Riwle or Guide for Anchoresses) is an anonymous monastic rule (or manual) for anchoresses written in the early 13th century.

The work consists of eight parts: divine service, keeping the heart, moral lessons and examples, temptation, confession, penance, love, and domestic matters. Parts 1 and 8 deal with what is called the &quot;Outer Rule&quot; (relating to the anchoresses&#x27; exterior life), while Parts 2–7 deal with the &quot;Inner Rule&quot; (relating to the anchoresses&#x27; interior life). It is written in Middle English, and was translated into Anglo-Norman and Latin.

==Community==
The adoption of an anchorite life was widespread all over medieval Europe, and was especially popular in England. By the early thirteenth century, the lives of anchorites or anchoresses were considered distinct from that of hermits. The hermit vocation permitted a change of location, whereas the anchorites were bound to one place of enclosure, generally a cell connected to a church.

&quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot; was originally composed for three sisters who chose to enter the contemplative life. In the early twentieth century, it was thought that this might be Kilburn Priory near the medieval City of London, and attempts were made to date the work to the early twelfth century and to identify the author as a Godwyn, who led the house until 1130. More recent works have criticised this view, most notably because the dialect of English in which the work is written clearly originates from somewhere in the English West Midlands, not far from the Welsh border.

In 1935 the Early English Text Society which was led by Sir Israel Gollancz and managed by Mabel Day decided to publish editions of the Ancrene Wisse. Day advised on several editions and she worked on the Nero MS version which had been transcribed by J. A. Herbert. The principles which she established are said to have governed all the later editors.

Geoffrey Shepherd in the production of his edition of parts six and seven of the work showed that the author&#x27;s reading was extensive. Shepherd linked the author&#x27;s interests with those of a generation of late twelfth-century English and French scholars at the University of Paris, including Peter the Chanter and Stephen Langton. Shepherd suggested that the author was a scholarly man, though writing in English in the provinces, who was kept up to date with what was said and being written in the centres of learning.

EJ Dobson argues that the anchoresses were enclosed near Limebrook in Herefordshire, and that the author was an Augustinian canon at nearby Wigmore Abbey in Herefordshire named Brian of Lingen. Bella Millett has subsequently argued that the author was in fact a Dominican rather than an Augustinian.

The revision of the work contained in the manuscript held at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (used by most modern translations) can be dated between 1224 and 1235. The date of the first writing of the work tends to depend upon one&#x27;s view of the influence of the pastoral reforms of the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council. Shepherd believes that the work does not show such influence, and thinks a date shortly after 1200 most likely. Dobson argues for a date between 1215 and 1221, after the council and before the coming of the Dominicans to England. The general contours of this account have found favour in modern textbook assessments of the text.

==Language and textual criticism==
The version of &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot; contained in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, is known as MS 402. It was written in an early Middle English dialect known as &#x27;AB language&#x27; where &#x27;A&#x27; denotes the manuscript Corpus Christi 402, and &#x27;B&#x27; the manuscript Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Bodley 34. Manuscript Bodley 34 contains a set of texts that have become known as the &quot;Katherine Group&quot;: Seinte Katerine, Seinte Margarete, Seinte Iuliene, Hali Meiðhad and Sawles Warde. Both manuscripts were written in the AB language, described by J. R. R. Tolkien as &quot;a faithful transcript of some dialect...or a &#x27;standard&#x27; language based on one&#x27; in use in the West Midlands in the 13th century.&quot; The word &quot;Ancrene&quot; itself still exhibits a feminine plural genitive inflection descended from the old Germanic weak noun declension; this was practically unknown by the time of Chaucer.

The didactic and devotional material is supplemented by illustrations and anecdotes, many drawn from everyday life. 

&quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot; is often grouped by scholars alongside the &quot;Katherine Group&quot; and the &quot;Wooing Group&quot;—both collections of early Middle English religious texts written in AB language.

==Surviving manuscripts==
There are seventeen surviving medieval manuscripts containing all or part of &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot;. Of these, nine are in the original Middle English, four are translations into Anglo-Norman, and a further four are translations into Latin. The shortest extract is the Lanhydrock Fragment, which consists of only one sheet of parchment. The extant manuscripts are listed below.

Although none of the manuscripts is believed to be produced by the original author, several date from the first half of the 13th century. The first complete edition edited by Morton in 1853 was based on the British Library manuscript Cotton Nero A.xiv. Recent editors have favoured Corpus Christi College, Cambridge MS 402 of which Bella Millett has written: &quot;Its linguistic consistency and general high textual quality have made it increasingly the preferred base manuscript for editions, translations, and studies of Ancrene Wisse.&quot; It was used as the base manuscript in the critical edition published as two volumes in 2005–2006. The Corpus manuscript is the only one to include the title &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot;.

The &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot; was partly retranslated from French back into English and reincorporated in the late 15th-century &quot;Treatise of Love&quot;. The fifteenth-century &quot;Treatise of the Five Senses&quot; also makes use of material from the work.

<text>Qashqai (قشقایی ديلى, &quot;Qašqāyī dili&quot;, pronounced in English as , and also spelled Qaşqay, Qashqayi, Kashkai, Kashkay, Qašqāʾī and Qashqa&#x27;i or Kaşkay) is an Oghuz Turkic language spoken by the Qashqai people, an ethnic group living mainly in the Fars province of Southern Iran. &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; regards Qashqai as an independent third group of dialects within the Southwestern Turkic language group. It is known to speakers as Turki. Estimates of the number of Qashqai speakers vary. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; gave a figure of million in 2021.

The Qashqai language is closely related to Azerbaijani. However, some Qashqai varieties namely the variety spoken in the Sheshbeyli tribe share features with Turkish. In a sociopolitical sense, though, Qashqai is considered a language in its own right.

Like other Turkic languages spoken in Iran, such as the Azerbaijani language, Qashqai uses a modified version of the Perso-Arabic script.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
* Sounds // and // only occur as loan consonants from Persian and Arabic.
* Sounds /, , , / mainly occur phonemically before consonants, but may occur as aspirated before vowels or in word-final position as [].
* Sounds /, , / never occur in word-initial position, except in a few loan words.
* [] only occurs as an intervocalic allophone of // when occurring between two rounded vowels. It may also occur in vowel diphthongs as [].
* // and // can occur phonemically as [] and [] when preceding front vowels.
* // may occur as two allophones; as [] before front vowels, or as [] before back vowels.
* // can have two allophones; as [] in word-initial and word-medial positions, or as [] in word-final positions. In native words, // rarely occurs word-initially.

=== Vowels ===
* Vowels // and // are used rather infrequently.
* // only occurs as a word-final variant of //.
*// is always realized in word-final position as [].
* // can be realized as [] in non-initial positions.
* // mainly occurs as a centralized allophone [] when preceding palatal consonants.
* Vowel // is in free variation with its rounded equivalent //, when occurring in front syllables.

== Syntax ==
Qashqai follows common Turkic syntax features: dependent marking, head-final within unmarked phrases, free word order with SOV preferred, agglutinative. Grammatical cases in Qashqai Turkic include: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, ablative, terminative, equative and instrumental.

<text>Eric Sidney Watkins (6 September 1928 – 12 September 2012), also known as Professor Sid or simply Prof, was an English neurosurgeon. From to , Watkins served as Safety and Medical Delegate in Formula One.

Born and raised in Liverpool, Watkins enrolled at the University of Liverpool where he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1952. He then served four years in the Royal Army Medical Corps before specialising in neurosurgery in Oxford and later, in London. Watkins also acted as a race track doctor at weekends which he continued at Watkins Glen International when he was appointed a Professor of Neurosurgery at State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse.

At a meeting with Brabham team boss Bernie Ecclestone, he was offered the role as the FIA Formula One Safety and Medical Delegate, head of the Formula One on-track medical team, and first responder in case of a crash, a role which Watkins performed for 26 years. He is credited with helping save the lives of many drivers, including: Gerhard Berger, Martin Donnelly, Érik Comas, Rubens Barrichello, Karl Wendlinger, and Mika Häkkinen.

Eric Sidney Watkins was born on 6 September 1928 in Liverpool to Wallace and Jessica Watkins. Wallace was originally a coal miner from Gloucestershire, but had moved to Liverpool during the Great Depression of the 1930s where he started a small business initially repairing bicycles before progressing to motor vehicle repairs. Watkins worked for his father at the garage until he was 25. He had two brothers and a sister. Watkins gained a scholarship at Prescot Grammar School. He told his father that he wanted to become a doctor, an idea of which his father disapproved.

Watkins graduated as a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Liverpool in 1956; during his time there he carried out research on the effects of heat stress on performance, finding that increased heat greatly affected intellectual performance. This research would later prove useful as part of his work in motor racing. Following graduation, he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in West Africa for four years. There he competed in his only motorsport event, driving a Ford Zephyr Zodiac in the 1955 West African Rally, retiring from the event after the first stage. He returned to the UK in 1958 to specialise in neurosurgery at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, and it was in 1961 when he took up his first motorsport event in a medical capacity at a kart race at the Brands Hatch circuit. During his free time he acted as race doctor at the Silverstone Circuit.

Upon receiving an offer to be a professor of neurosurgery at the State University of New York in 1962, Watkins moved to Syracuse, New York, and continued his interest in motorsport at the Watkins Glen circuit. Watkins took four members to the circuit and his own medical equipment due to the lack of supplies provided by circuit officials. He returned to England in 1970 to act as head of neurosurgery at the London Hospital, and was invited to join the RAC medical panel the same year.

==Formula One==

===1970s===
In 1978, Watkins met Bernie Ecclestone, at the time chief executive of the Formula One Constructors Association, who offered Watkins the position of official Formula One race doctor. Ecclestone had checked in for a medical problem and offered Watkins $35,000 a year for the entire season. Watkins had to pay airfares, hotel bills, rental cars and all incidental expenses. Watkins accepted, and attended his first race at the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix. Outside of the Grand Prix weekends, he remained in his position as a neurosurgeon in London. His first day as the Safety and Medical Delegate, was at Brands Hatch to introduce himself to the drivers. Watkins did not attend private test day sessions due to the large number of sessions held over the course of the year.

Initially, his appointment was met with hostility by some of the racing circuits, who saw his appointment as a way of monitoring their performance. At the time, medical facilities would sometimes consist of nothing more than a tent. At the 1978 Italian Grand Prix, Ronnie Peterson crashed heavily on the first lap, with the car catching fire. Fellow drivers Clay Regazzoni, Patrick Depailler and James Hunt pulled him from the wreckage but by the time Watkins arrived at the scene, Italian police had formed a human wall to prevent people from entering the area. Watkins was initially stopped from assisting with the treatment and there was a long delay of approximately 18 minutes before an ambulance arrived to take Peterson to hospital, where he died the following day. Following the race, Watkins demanded that Ecclestone provide better safety equipment, an anaesthetist, a medical car and a medical helicopter (Medevac). All were provided at the next race in the United States. In addition, it was decided that the medical car containing Watkins would follow the racing cars for the first lap of the race to provide immediate help in the event of a first lap incident. The organisers at Hockenheim had denied Watkins access to race control and Ecclestone threatened to stand in front of the grid and order the drivers out of their cars.

===1980s===
1981 saw FISA, motorsport&#x27;s governing body at the time, appoint a Medical Commission, with Watkins elected president. In 1982, at the Belgian Grand Prix, Watkins went with the medical car driven by Roland Bruynseraede as it headed to the scene of Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s serious accident and placed a tube into his windpipe for ventilation with his heart in normal condition. Villeneuve was airlifted by helicopter to the Gasthuisberg Hospital in Leuven and Watkins spoke to Villeneuve&#x27;s wife Joann who was in her home in Monaco when 1979 champion Jody Scheckter informed her of the news. Joann flew to Belgium along with Scheckter&#x27;s wife Pam to speak with Watkins. Joann and Watkins both accepted the decision to turn off his respirator, and Villeneuve died.

At the Canadian Grand Prix later that year, Watkins had to deal with the fatal accident of Riccardo Paletti on the first lap of the race. Watkins got to Paletti&#x27;s car 16 seconds after impact and opened the visor of the helmet to see his blown pupils. Then, before any medical attention could be received, Paletti&#x27;s car caught fire due to the petrol tank having ruptured and ignited. Watkins had suitable clothing to prevent him from suffering serious burns but his hands were affected. After he extinguished the fire, he took off his gloves to put an airway into Paletti&#x27;s throat but Watkins&#x27; boots had melted in the fire. At the British Grand Prix in 1985, Watkins received a silver trophy during the drivers briefing. The trophy reads; &quot;To the Prof, our thanks for your invaluable contribution to Formula 1. Nice to know you&#x27;re there&quot;. In 1986, Watkins had the responsibility for caring for Frank Williams who sustained spinal cord injuries in a car crash on a public road.

In 1987, Nelson Piquet crashed during practice at the San Marino Grand Prix, and was declared unfit to race by Watkins. Despite it being only the second race of the season, Piquet tried to persuade officials to allow him to compete knowing any lost points could lose him the championship (which he ultimately won). In response, Watkins threatened to resign if overruled. The officials opted to support Watkins, and Piquet sat out the race, later admitting that it was the correct decision.

===1990s===
Watkins founded the Brain and Spine Foundation in 1992, a charity that aims to improve &quot;the prevention, treatment and care of people affected by disorders of the brain and spine&quot;. He was a Patron of the foundation.

At the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, Watkins had to attend to his close personal friend, three-time champion Ayrton Senna, following the accident which claimed his life. Watkins had concerns about Senna&#x27;s mental state following two crashes earlier in the weekend that had injured Senna&#x27;s countryman and protege Rubens Barrichello and killed Austrian Roland Ratzenberger, suggesting to him that the two leave the track, go fishing, and forget about the race. Early in the race, Senna hit a retaining wall at nearly 140 miles per hour and Watkins was the first to attend to the driver. He reported that based on what he ascertained on arriving at the scene, that there was no chance Senna could have been saved, due to the graveness of the head injury he had suffered. Watkins also said he noticed Senna sighed, and his whole body relaxed, and that, though he was not religious, he felt it was at that moment Senna&#x27;s &quot;spirit left his body&quot;. The FIA Expert Advisory Safety Committee was set up in 1994 following the race and Watkins was appointed as its chairman. Watkins was also responsible for setting up a rally research group and karting research group in 2003. The three groups were brought together in 2004 as the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety, with Watkins as president.

For the 1995 European Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello and Max Papis failed their drug tests after the Saturday qualifying session when both tested positive for ephedrine. Watkins later argued that ephedrine had no effect on a driver&#x27;s ability and that Formula One should not use exactly the same list as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in any case. At the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, Mika Häkkinen crashed heavily during the Friday qualifying session at the Brewery Bend at high-speed due to a puncture having been sustained by one of his tyres. Häkkinen was immediately rendered unconscious but did not hit his head against the surrounding wall or cockpit. Two volunteer doctors, Jereme Cockings and Steve Lewis, arrived at the scene in 15 seconds and performed an emergency tracheotomy. Watkins arrived last and allowed the doctors to continue, restarting Häkkinen&#x27;s heart twice.

Watkins was awarded the Mario Andretti Award for Medical Excellence in 1996.

===2000s===
Watkins acted in the defence for David Vissenga in an inquiry into practices into services of the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, where marshal Graham Beverige died after being struck by a wheel from Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s car in the 2001 Australian Grand Prix. In 2002, Watkins was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for recognition of his work in improving the safety of Grand Prix racing.

The University of Liverpool presented him with an honorary doctorate at a ceremony in Liverpool on 8 July 2004. On 26 September 2004, Watkins along with Gary Hartstein were first on the scene when Peter Phillips and three other team members were travelling on the same stretch of road as Watkins and Hartstein when their van collided with another car at high speed. On 12 October 2004, Watkins became the first president of the FIA Foundation for the Automobile and Society, and in December of that year he became the first president of the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety, both created in honour of the FIA&#x27;s hundredth anniversary.

==Retirement==
After his retirement, the FIA recognised Watkins for being largely responsible for the modernisation of medical standards in Formula One. On 20 January 2005, Watkins announced his retirement from his various medical positions in the FIA, but stated his intention to continue as President of the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety. FIA President Max Mosley appointed Watkins&#x27;s longtime deputy Gary Hartstein as his successor. Following his departure, Mosley remarked that &quot;Professor Watkins has made a unique contribution to improving the standards of safety and medical intervention throughout motor sport.&quot; In September 2005, a campaign to knight Watkins was started by a group of supporters.

In July 2008, Watkins was honoured for the award of &quot;Most Outstanding Contribution to the Motorsport Industry&quot; with the award presented by Martin Brundle at the House of Lords. On 8 December 2011 it was announced that Watkins had stepped down as President of the FIA Institute, but would continue in an honorary role. The day after retiring, he received the FIA Academy Gold Medal for Motor Sport at the official FIA Gala prize-giving ceremony in Dubai.

Since 1998, each year the Motorsport Safety Fund organises the Watkins Lecture, which takes place at the Autosport International Show at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. These lectures usually focus on motorsport safety related matters, and have been delivered by guest speakers such as Max Mosley and Ross Brawn. Watkins himself delivered the inaugural lecture and again in 2007.

Watkins wrote or co-authored a number of books on racing safety, including &quot;Life at the Limit: Triumph and Tragedy in Formula One.&quot;

==Personal life==
Watkins had two sons, Sid and Alistair and two daughters, Jessica and Martha. He also shared two stepsons, Matthew and Antony with his third wife Susan, a biographer and historian. He had a passion for smoking cigars, drinking whisky, and fishing. His eldest son Sid, was a Consultant Paediatrician at Southampton General Hospital. His second son, Alastair is a former Media Delegate who worked for the FIA, Kirch Media and was the marketing director for British American Racing. His stepson, Antony, is a consultant neurosurgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. Watkins also had nine grandchildren.

==Death and legacy==
Watkins died on 12 September 2012 at the King Edward VII Hospital in London. His family was at his bedside. Tributes to Watkins were paid by many drivers who have competed in Formula One and other figures within the sport. Watkins was buried in a private ceremony near the border of Scotland on 18 September. This was followed by a memorial service that was held at St Marylebone Parish Church in London on 18 January 2013. The service was attended by 200 people which included figures from within Formula One.

At the Singapore Grand Prix, a one-minute silence was held in his honour and a book of remembrance was available for people to sign their condolences during the weekend. This book was presented to the Watkins family on behalf of the FIA, FIA Institute and the Formula One community. In December 2012, &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine named Sid one of &quot;The Men of the Year 2012&quot; for saving lives in Formula One. Richard Hammond said &quot;He was a legend throughout motorsport, and he&#x27;s still saving lives now he&#x27;s gone&quot;.

A new building bearing Watkins&#x27; name was officially opened by Anne, Princess Royal at The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust in Fazakerley, Liverpool on 15 December 2015. Her Royal Highness unveiled a commemorative plaque and a bust of Watkins in honour of his contributions to both motorsport and neurosurgery.

<text>KGMB (channel 5) is a television station in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, serving the Hawaiian Islands as an affiliate of CBS. It is owned by Gray Media alongside dual NBC/Telemundo affiliate KHNL (channel 13) and Kailua-Kona–licensed KFVE (channel 6), which relays KHNL&#x27;s second and sixth digital subchannels. The stations share studios on Waiakamilo Road in Honolulu&#x27;s Kapālama neighborhood; KGMB&#x27;s transmitter is located in Akupu, Hawaii.

==History==
The station first signed on the air on December 1, 1952, as the second television station in Hawaii. KGMB-TV was originally owned by J. Howard Worrall along with KGMB radio (AM 590, now KSSK) and operated from studios on Kapiolani Boulevard in Honolulu. The station carried programming from three of the four major networks at the time (excluding DuMont), but was a primary CBS affiliate owing to KGMB-AM&#x27;s long affiliation with CBS Radio. The station lost NBC programming when KONA-TV (channel 2, now KHON-TV) signed on two weeks later, and lost ABC when KULA-TV (channel 4, now KITV) launched in April 1954. In 1973, a partnership led by future Hawaii congressman Cecil Heftel bought KGMB-AM-TV, then turned around and sold the KGMB stations to Lee Enterprises in 1977. Lee sold off the radio station in 1980. In 1982, the station dropped the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix from its call sign.

The real-life KGMB news crew was often featured in one of the longest-running police dramas on CBS in the 1970s, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. The station also had ties to the iconic series&#x27; reboot, as CBS allowed KGMB to let its viewers preview the season premiere episode early at the Waikiki Shell each September during the rebooted series&#x27; run.
In 2000, Lee exited from television broadcasting and sold most of its television holdings (including KGMB) to Emmis Communications. Emmis already owned KHON-TV, so it had to obtain a cross-ownership waiver for the purchase of KGMB from the Federal Communications Commission, to bypass the recently passed duopoly rules that forbid common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. This waiver was renewed several times while Emmis owned both stations. At that time, KHON moved its operations into KGMB&#x27;s facility, though the two stations maintained separate news departments.

From September 2, 2002, to October 31, 2004, KGMB carried select UPN programming via a secondary affiliation shared with KHON; each station aired programs from that network that the other station did not air. The two stations began carrying UPN programming in September 2002 after KFVE (which had been with UPN since its January 1995 launch) disaffiliated from the network to become a full-time affiliate of The WB (whose programming aired on KFVE in a secondary capacity since December 1998). KIKU, an independent station specializing in Japanese programming, became a secondary UPN affiliate on November 1, 2004, and remained with the network until its closure on September 15, 2006.

Emmis itself prepared to exit the television industry and sold KHON to the Montecito Broadcast Group in 2006. Emmis then announced on February 20, 2007, that KGMB and its satellites had been sold to MCG Capital Corporation for $40 million, resulting in one of the rare instances involving a complete separation of a television station duopoly. The FCC approved the sale in late May and was completed on June 4, 2007. Shortly after MCG Capital Corporation took over, KGMB adopted a logo similar to the one it used in the early 1980s and also rolled out a new graphics package for its newscast and a new website.

For many years, KGMB billed itself as &quot;One of the Good Things About Hawaii&quot; with its rich history of local television programming exclusively in Hawaii, especially in such shows as &quot;Skipper Al&quot; and &quot;Checkers &amp; Pogo&quot; (both children&#x27;s programs; the latter being the most remembered, airing from 1967 to 1982 and featured Morgan White), &quot;The Hawaii Moving Company&quot; (originally a disco/dance program that transitioned into a general interest show), and the 1982 television special &quot;Rap&#x27;s Hawaii&quot; starring Rap Reiplinger. This slogan was made famous by an &quot;a cappella&quot; jingle which is still heard on KGMB today. At the end of KGMB&#x27;s morning newscast, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, it can now be heard leading into &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;. Later, with an emphasis on weather, the station branded itself &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Severe Weather Station&quot;.

===Channel swap===
On August 18, 2009, MCG Capital and Raycom Media (owner of KHNL and, at the time, KFVE) announced a shared services agreement with Raycom as senior partner. As part of the deal, KGMB vacated its longtime studios on Kapiolani Boulevard; the combined operation would be based at KHNL/KFVE&#x27;s studios on Waiakamilo Road. Though non-news programming would remain in place, news operations of the three stations would be combined into a single entity. The arrangement would also see a channel swap, with KGMB moving from virtual channel 9 (UHF digital channel 23) to channel 5 (UHF digital channel 22) and KFVE move from 5 to 9.

The resulting ownership arrangement of the stations generated some controversy, as it had the effect of Raycom trading KFVE to MCG Capital in return for KGMB. Organizations such as media watchdog group Media Council Hawaii viewed the plan as a way to circumvent FCC rules preventing one company owning two of the four highest-rated stations in the same market—in this case, KGMB and KHNL. However, the FCC only recognizes ownership of facility identifications, which remain attached to their channel numbers, and not ownership of a station&#x27;s intellectual unit (call letters, programming, network affiliation, etc.). In this case, Raycom kept ownership of Facility ID 34445, now belonging to KGMB, while MCG Capital still owns Facility ID 36917, which now belonged to KFVE; the overall viewership of channel 5, as KFVE, fell outside the criteria that would have otherwise barred a duopoly between KHNL and KGMB if facility IDs were traded as well.

Raycom Media president Paul McTear staunchly defended the SSA, stating it would &quot;preserve three stations that provide important and valuable local, national and international programming to viewers in Hawaii.&quot; Further controversy over the SSA grew after a November 7, 2009, report in the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; revealed that Raycom would pay MCG Capital Corporation $22 million (according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission) – which, in effect, would constitute a sale of KGMB from MCG Capital to Raycom. Both companies did not mention any monetary exchanges during its August SSA announcement, only &quot;assets&quot;. The FCC, in response to Media Council Hawaii&#x27;s filing of an objection over the SSA, asked Raycom for detailed, unredacted agreements in relation to the SSA.

The SSA and channel swap took effect on October 26, 2009, with KGMB moving from virtual channel 9 to channel 5 and changing its branding from &quot;KGMB 9&quot; to just &quot;KGMB.&quot; An estimated 68 positions from a total of 198 between the three stations would be eliminated as part of the agreement. On May 8, 2010, the remaining items and memorabilia that were left at KGMB&#x27;s former studios were auctioned off, with proceeds going to charity.

===Removal from Nielsen ratings===
Beginning in 2016, the Hawaii News Now (HNN) group of KGMB, KHNL, and KFVE severed ties to the Nielsen ratings. After the November 25 sweeps, Raycom opted to use other research to track KHNL and KGMB audiences. KFVE, owned by HITV, is affected also. In Hawaii, Nielsen does not use electronic means to track audiences. Recently, only 914 of the printed Nielsen booklets, known as monthly diaries, were completed out of 11,400 diaries. KITV and KHON will continue to use Nielsen ratings.

===Sale to Gray Television===
On June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom&#x27;s 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including KGMB and KHNL), and Gray&#x27;s 93 television stations) under the former&#x27;s corporate umbrella. In the cash-and-stock merger transaction, valued at $3.6 billion, Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom. Because Raycom operates three stations in the Honolulu market, the companies were required to sell either KHNL, KGMB or KFVE to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules.

On November 1, 2018, Nexstar Media Group – which has owned Fox affiliate KHON-TV since January 2017 – announced that it would acquire KFVE and the licenses of satellites KGMD-TV and KGMV from American Spirit Media for $6.5 million. Nexstar concurrently assumed the station&#x27;s operations through a time brokerage agreement that took effect the day the transaction paperwork was filed with the FCC, under which Raycom forwarded the rights to certain managerial services involving KFVE – not counting certain other services to which Raycom would retain stewardship under the TBA – on a transitional basis. Under the deal, which is expected to receive regulatory approval in the first quarter of 2019, Nexstar also intends to integrate KFVE&#x27;s operations into KHON&#x27;s studio facilities at the Hawaiki Tower on Piikoi and Waimanu Streets. However, Raycom will retain rights to the KFVE intellectual unit (call letters, syndicated and local programming), which will be shifted to a digital subchannel of either KHNL or KGMB as will KFVE-DT2&#x27;s Bounce TV affiliation (which will be moved to KGMB-DT4); the KFVE calls will also be retained by Raycom for branding continuity. As such, Nexstar will likely assign new call letters to the channel 9 license as well as acquire programming to replace that being maintained by Raycom post-acquisition (which may include shifting the programming on KHON&#x27;s CW-affiliated DT2 feed to the KFVE license, and/or the retention of the MyNetworkTV affiliation, which Raycom did not include in the KFVE intellectual property transaction.)

The sale of KFVE to Nexstar was approved by the FCC on December 17; the Gray-Raycom merger was approved three days later. The sale was completed on January 2, 2019.

==Programming==
KGMB clears all CBS programming, although it will occasionally preempt prime time shows until the overnight hours in order to broadcast locally produced specials. In its early days, the only major CBS programs KGMB regularly preempted were &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; and the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;, due to its morning broadcast of the popular in-house children&#x27;s program &quot;Checkers &amp; Pogo&quot;, which also aired in the afternoon. Like most of the other network-affiliated stations in Hawaii, KGMB had to shuffle CBS programs because the shows were flown in via air mail or shipped a week (or several weeks) after the programs aired in the U.S. mainland; the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in particular would often air at 12 midnight or later depending on how late the tape was in arriving from the East Coast.

KGMB airs CBS&#x27; daytime programs in a very different order from the main network feed; this is because the station airs the lineup in the order that it arrives from the network, which for unknown reasons is different from that of most CBS affiliates. From September 14, 1998, to the September 18, 2009, conclusion of &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, air times included &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; at 10 a.m., &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; at 11:30 a.m. (following a half-hour infomercial at 11 a.m.), &quot;Guiding Light&quot; at noon, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; at 1 p.m., and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; at 2 p.m. In most other markets, &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; aired first, followed by &quot;B&amp;B&quot;, &quot;ATWT&quot;, and &quot;GL&quot;. &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; (CBS&#x27; replacement for &quot;Guiding Light&quot;) assumed the noon slot when it debuted on October 5, 2009, while &quot;The Talk&quot; (which replaced &quot;As the World Turns&quot;) took over the 2 p.m. time slot on October 18, 2010. The station also airs the weekday edition of &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; an hour later, from 8 to 10 a.m. local time, due to its morning newscast &quot;Sunrise&quot; airing until 8 a.m. On weekdays outside of network hours, KGMB airs syndicated first-run shows during the daytime and sitcom reruns overnight. On weekends during the Hawaii Warriors football season, KGMB airs &quot;The Nick Rolovich Show&quot;, which recaps the last game played and previews the next one.

===High definition===
KGMB currently broadcasts most of its programming, including CBS network shows and sports events such as NFL and college basketball games, in full 1080i high definition. In the late 2000s, the station upgraded its servers to broadcast timeshifted programming in high definition such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Unit&quot;, and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The shows, which are received from the U.S. mainland in the afternoon, were previously recorded in standard definition before being rebroadcast in the evening. On January 14, 2008, KGMB&#x27;s HD feed became available on Oceanic Time Warner Cable digital channel 1007. Prior to that date, it was the only major station in the market not available in HD on Oceanic. A temporary agreement was reached between KGMB and Oceanic Time Warner to carry Super Bowl XLI in high definition. KGMB also broadcasts some local programming in high definition, such as newscasts.

===News operation===
KGMB presently broadcasts 27 hours, 25 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5 hours, 5 minutes each weekday, and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). For its first 25 years on the air, KGMB was the dominant news station in Hawaii. However, in 1978, rival KHON-TV persuaded sports director Joe Moore to join that station as its lead anchor. Within a few years, KHON had passed KGMB for the lead, and KGMB has placed either second or third in the ratings since then.

From September 2005 to August 2007, KGMB aired the nationally syndicated morning show &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; on weekdays from 5 to 7 a.m. Although that program runs three hours, the station only aired the first two hours; during this period, KGMB was the only &quot;Big Three&quot; affiliate in the United States that carried the show. The program was dropped on August 17, 2007, to make room for a new morning newscast titled &quot;Sunrise on KGMB 9&quot;, which launched on September 17. &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; moved to KHON&#x27;s CW-affiliated second digital subchannel on August 20; ironically, that show competes with KHON&#x27;s own &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Morning News&quot;. In June 2007, KGMB built new studios and launched an updated website.

In 2008, the station announced plans to upgrade its news production to high definition. However, on December 13 of that year, KGMB announced that those plans had been put on hold due to the possibility of relocating its studio facilities. The station planned to begin producing its newscasts in widescreen standard definition as early as July 2009. With the launch of the &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot; operation on October 26, 2009, KGMB began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. KGMB and KHNL began to jointly produce and simulcast weeknight 5 and 10 p.m. newscasts, while KHNL moved its 6 p.m. newscast to 5:30. KGMB continues to have its own weeknight 6 p.m. newscast. The only times when KGMB and KHNL do not simulcast news programming are on weekdays during the 7 a.m. hour when KHNL airs NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, at 5:30 p.m. when KGMB airs the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and at 6 p.m. when KHNL airs &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. Weekday morning and weekend shows are simulcast on the two stations but are subject to preemption on one of the stations due to network obligations. The local news schedule on KFVE remains unchanged. There is no weekday midday news on either station. While the merged operation is based at KHNL&#x27;s old studio, most of the on-air personalities are holdovers from KGMB; all but four of KHNL&#x27;s reporters were fired after the merger.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KGMB ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on January 15, 2009, the date on which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts (almost five months earlier than the June 12 transition date for stations on the U.S. mainland). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 23, using virtual channel 9. Following the channel swap with KFVE, the station&#x27;s digital channel switched to UHF channel 23 and its virtual channel to 5.

At the same time, KGMD&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 8 to its former analog-era VHF channel 9, while KGMV&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 24 (using its former analog channel 3 as its virtual channel) for post-transition digital operations.

==Satellite stations==
As with other major television stations in Hawaii, KGMB operates multiple satellite stations and translators across the Hawaiian Islands to rebroadcast the station&#x27;s programming outside of metropolitan Honolulu.
Notes:
===Former satellites===
KGMD and KGMV used to simulcast KGMB programming until the 2009 channel swap with KFVE (now KHII-TV). The station was also simulcast on translators K69BZ (channel 69) in Lihue, which had a transmitter northwest of Omao, and K57BI (channel 57) in Waimea, with its transmitter in Kalaheo. As of October 2015, however, K57BI and K69BZ&#x27;s licenses were canceled by the FCC.

<text>Northfields is a London Underground station in Northfields, in the London Borough of Ealing. It is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line, between Boston Manor and South Ealing stations. The station is located on Northfield Avenue (B452) and in Travelcard Zone 3.
==History==
The route through Northfields station was opened by the District Railway (DR, now the District line), on 1 May 1883 on a line to Hounslow Town (located on Hounslow High Street but now closed). The station opened as Northfield (Ealing) on 16 April 1908. The station was renamed Northfields and Little Ealing on 11 December 1911.

The station was rebuilt twice. As a halt, the 1908 station was quite basic and provided only rudimentary shelters for passengers. The first rebuilding took place in the 1910s (possibly in conjunction with the 1911 renaming) and the station was given a proper booking hall on the bridge over the tracks and better platform canopies.

In the early 1930s, a new Northfields station was built in conjunction with the preparations for the introduction of Piccadilly line services on the Hounslow branch and the new Northfields depot that would house its trains. Located on the east side of Northfields Avenue, the new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass. Like the stations at Sudbury Town, Sudbury Hill, Acton Town and Oakwood that Holden also designed, Northfields station features a tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure that contains station offices and shops. The brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof.

The new station opened on 18 December 1932 with the current name. It has two island platforms serving four sets of tracks (two eastbound and two westbound) and is connected directly to the Northfields depot immediately to the west of the station and south of the tracks. Trains may terminate at Northfields station and then run on to the west to enter the depot. To avoid operational conflicts between the eastbound depot exit track and the westbound running track to Boston Manor, the westbound running track passes under the depot track in a cutting. Trains normally enter and exit service at Northfields although there is also a single track connection from the depot to the westbound running track west of Boston Manor.
Piccadilly line services started running to Northfields from Acton Town on 9 January 1933 and were extended to run to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933. From this date, the branch was operated jointly by both lines until District line services were withdrawn west of Northfields on 9 October 1964 and between Acton Town and Northfields on 10 October 1964.

On 17 May 1994, Northfields station was made a Grade II listed building.

London Buses routes E2 and E3 and night route N11 serve the station.

<text>Digital Chocolate, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher headquartered in San Mateo, California. It was founded in 2003 by Trip Hawkins, the founder of video game companies Electronic Arts and The 3DO Company. The company focused on developing games for Java ME-based mobile phones, iOS, and Microsoft Windows, and made some non-entertainment titles. Its marketing motto was &quot;Seize the minute&quot;.

The developer was officially closed in 2014. It has sold its games to RockYou, and its website was shut down.

==History==

Digital Chocolate was founded in 2003 by Hawkins after the failure of The 3DO Company. It had operations in San Mateo, Seattle, St. Petersburg, Bangalore, Helsinki, and Mexicali.

In 2004, Digital Chocolate acquired European developer Sumea, which then became its Helsinki studio.

On August 15, 2011, Digital Chocolate agreed to acquire Sandlot Games, a leading casual game developer and publisher.

In May 2012, Trip Hawkins stepped down as CEO to move to a &quot;consulting and advisory relationship&quot; with the company. The company also announced plans to lay off 180 employees.

&quot;Galaxy Life&quot; is its most successful title on Facebook to date, ranking at 284th bucket of MAU (Monthly Active Users) as of September 13, 2013.
 In 2013, Digital Chocolate&#x27;s Barcelona studio was sold to Ubisoft with the &quot;Galaxy Life&quot; IP and the Helsinki studio was closed.

In April 2014, Digital Chocolate&#x27;s four remaining Facebook games — &quot;Army Attack&quot;, &quot;Crazy Penguin Wars&quot;, &quot;Millionaire City&quot;, and &quot;Zombie Lane&quot; — were licensed to RockYou, along with the hiring of its developers to continue work on the games.

<text>Leytonstone () is a London Underground station in Leytonstone in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, east London. It is on the Central line, between Leyton and Snaresbrook (on the direct route towards Epping) or Wanstead (on the Hainault loop towards Woodford) stations. The station is on the boundary of Zones 3 and 4. It is close to Whipps Cross University Hospital. It is a terminus for some services and returns westbound.

==History==
The railway line from Loughton Branch Junction (on the Lea Valley line between and ) to Loughton was built by the Eastern Counties Railway and opened on 22 August 1856. A station at Leytonstone was opened on the same day. In turn it became, from 1862, part of the Great Eastern Railway system and then in 1923 part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway before being transferred to London Transport in 1947. This formed part of the New Works Programme (1935–1940) that was to see major changes at Leytonstone with the station becoming the junction of the existing Loughton-Epping-Ongar line, newly electrified, with the new tube tunnel running under Eastern Avenue towards Newbury Park. This work saw a complete reconstruction of the station along with the removal of the level crossing at Church Lane and its replacement by an underbridge. The work stopped in May 1940 due to wartime priorities; further delays were caused by the station buildings being hit by a German bomb in January 1944. During the war, the new tunnels were used as an aircraft component factory; the part closest to Leytonstone was a public air-raid shelter.

The station was first served by the Central line on 5 May 1947, when it became the temporary terminus of the line, passengers changing to steam shuttle onwards to Epping. This ceased on 14 December 1947 with the extension of Underground services to Woodford and Newbury Park.

===Notable events===

* In honour of the centenary of the birth of film director Sir Alfred Hitchcock (born 13 August 1899 in Leytonstone), the London Borough of Waltham Forest commissioned the Greenwich Mural Workshop to create a series of mosaics of Hitchcock&#x27;s life and works in the tube station. Work was started in June 2000 and the mosaics were unveiled on 3 May 2001.
* Three people were injured inside the station&#x27;s ticket hall during the evening of 5 December 2015, with one suffering serious knife injuries. The Metropolitan Police arrested the attacker inside the station after using Tasers against him. Video footage later emerged of the attacker repeatedly shouting &quot;this is for Syria&quot;. A remark shouted at the attacker by a witness, &quot;You ain’t no Muslim, bruv&quot;, resulted in considerable media comment and was subsequently praised by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron.

<doc id="845142" wikidata="Q256829" url="?curid=845142" title="Aurora Bridge">
<text>The Aurora Bridge (officially called the George Washington Memorial Bridge) is a cantilever and truss bridge in Seattle, Washington, United States. It carries State Route 99 (Aurora Avenue North) over the west end of Seattle&#x27;s Lake Union and connects Queen Anne and Fremont. The bridge is located just east of the Fremont Cut, which itself is spanned by the Fremont Bridge.

The Aurora Bridge is owned and operated by the Washington State Department of Transportation. It is long, wide, and above the water. The bridge was opened to traffic on February 22, 1932, the 200th anniversary of the birth of its namesake, George Washington, a Founding Father and first president of the United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

The bridge has been the site of numerous fatal incidents over the years. It is a popular location for suicide jumpers and several reports have used the bridge as a case study in fields ranging from suicide prevention to the effects of pre-hospital care on trauma victims. In 1998, a bus driver was shot and killed while driving over the bridge, causing his bus to crash and resulting in the death of one of the passengers. In 2015, five people died and fifty were injured when an amphibious duck tour vehicle crashed into a charter bus on the bridge in an incident that also involved two smaller vehicles.

==Design==
The bridge is long, wide, above the water and is owned and operated by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). There are two V-shaped cantilever sections supporting the bridge deck, each long and balanced on large concrete pilings at opposite sides of the ship canal which serve as the two main supporting anchors. Some 828 timber piles were driven for the foundation of the south anchor and 684 piles for the north. They range in size from and rest below the surface of the water. Together, the anchors support a load of 8,000 tons. Their construction required a pile driver that was specially designed to work underwater.

A long Warren truss suspended span connects the two cantilevers in the middle. The bridge&#x27;s main span is long. At either end of the bridge there are additional Warren truss spans which connect the cantilevered spans to the highway.

== History ==
Construction on the bridge piers began in 1929, with construction of the bridge following shortly afterwards in 1931. The bridge&#x27;s dedication was held on February 22, 1932, George Washington&#x27;s 200th birthday; it opened to traffic the same day. A time capsule was installed on the bridge by the widow of Judge Thomas Burke and is planned to be opened in 2032.

The bridge was the final link in what was then called the Pacific Highway (later known as U.S. Route 99), which ran from Canada to Mexico. The bridge crosses the Lake Union section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and, unlike earlier bridges across the canal, the height of the Aurora Bridge eliminated the need for a drawbridge. In 1930 Seattle City Council voted to build connecting portions of the highway through the Woodland Park Zoo, a decision which generated considerable controversy at the time.

The bridge was designed by the Seattle architectural firm Jacobs &amp; Ober, with Ralph Ober as the lead engineer on the project. Ober died in August 1931, of a brain hemorrhage while it was still under construction. Federal funding programs were not available at the time, so the bridge was funded by Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington.

The bridge was nominated for the National Register of Historic Places on January 2, 1980, on account of its &quot;functional and aesthetic&quot; design qualities and its historical status as the first bridge constructed in the region without streetcar tracks. It was accepted to the National Register on July 16, 1982. The bridge formerly had a set of pedestrian refuge islands in the highway&#x27;s median that were removed in 1944.

In 1990 the Fremont Troll—a large concrete sculpture of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge&#x27;s north end. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle&#x27;s Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program to raise money for community projects. The Troll was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction, and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.

Following the collapse of the Minneapolis I-35W arch-truss bridge on August 1, 2007, WSDOT was directed to perform inspections of all steel cantilever bridges in the state that used gusset plates in their design, including the George Washington Memorial Bridge. The bridge had earlier been certified as structurally sound with no serious deficiencies detected. That year, the Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory found the bridge to be &quot;functionally obsolete&quot;. The bridge was given a sufficiency rating of 55.2% and evaluated to be &quot;better than minimum adequacy to tolerate being left in place as is&quot;. Its foundations and railings met the acceptable standards and no immediate corrective action was needed to improve it.

The George Washington Memorial Bridge underwent extensive seismic retrofitting in 2011 and 2012 at a cost of $5.7 million. During a regular inspection in October 2019, WSDOT structural engineers determined that an outside stringer beam on the southbound side of the bridge had corroded to the point of creating a visible sag in the roadway. Southbound traffic was reduced to two lanes for an emergency repair that cost $500,000 and took seven days (out of a scheduled ten days).

===Accidents and incidents===

On November 27, 1998, King County Metro driver Mark McLaughlin, the driver of a southbound route 359 Express articulated bus, was shot and killed by a passenger, Silas Cool, while driving across the bridge. Cool then shot himself as the bus veered across two lanes of traffic and plunged off the bridge&#x27;s eastern side onto the roof of an apartment building below. Herman Liebelt, a passenger on the bus, later died of injuries he sustained in the crash. According to estimates from WSDOT, repairs to the bridge cost over $18,000. Medical claims from the victims against King County amounted to $2.3 million.

A service for McLaughlin was held on December 8, 1998, at KeyArena in Seattle. Numerous state and county officials and over 100 transit drivers attended the service, which included a procession of over eighty Metro buses and vans. Metro retired the number 359 as a route designation and replaced it with route 358 in February 1999, as part of a restructure of service on Aurora Avenue. On February 15, 2014, Route 358 itself was retired, and replaced with the RapidRide E Line.

On September 24, 2015, five people were killed and fifty were injured when an amphibious &quot;duck tour&quot; vehicle crashed into a charter bus on the bridge in a collision that also involved two smaller vehicles. According to a representative from the Chinese consulate, all of the students were foreign-born. The students all attended North Seattle College, and were on their way to Safeco Field for new student orientation. One witness reported that it appeared as though the duck boat veered into the oncoming bus, after crossing the center line. Some blame for the collision was placed on the narrowness of the bridge deck, which has lanes, and the lack of a median barrier to separate the two directions of traffic. There have also been some calls to reduce the number of lanes from six narrow lanes to four wider lanes, although early reports indicated that a mechanical failure of the duck tour vehicles&#x27; front axle may have also been a major factor in the crash.

==Suicides==
The bridge&#x27;s height and pedestrian access make it a popular location for suicide jumpers. Since construction, there have been over 230 suicides from the bridge, with nearly 50 deaths occurring in the decade 1995–2005. The first suicide occurred on January 20, 1932, when a shoe salesman leapt from the bridge before it was completed. A notable suicide was that of Cheryl Glass, one the first female African-American racing drivers in the United States.

Numerous reports have been written about the high incidence of suicide on the bridge, many of them using the bridge as a case study in fields ranging from suicide prevention to the effects of prehospital care on trauma victims. Despite the force of impact, jumpers occasionally survive the fall from the bridge, though not without sustaining serious injuries.

News sources have referred to the George Washington Memorial Bridge as a suicide bridge. In December 2006, six emergency phones and 18 signs were installed on the bridge to encourage people to seek help instead of jumping. Around that time, a group of community activists and political leaders living near the bridge created the Fremont Individuals and Employees Nonprofit to Decrease Suicides (FRIENDS), their primary focus being the installation of a suicide barrier on the bridge.

In 2007, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire allocated $1.4 million in her supplemental budget for the construction of an suicide-prevention fence to help reduce the number of suicides on the bridge. Construction of the fence began in spring 2010 and was completed in February 2011, at a total cost of $4.8 million.

<text>Guitar Wolf (Japanese: ) is a Japanese garage rock power trio founded in Tokyo in 1987. They coined the phrase &quot;jet rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, which they use to describe their musical style. The band is signed to Sony Music Japan&#x27;s Ki/oon Records division.

Guitar Wolf has released thirteen studio albums internationally as well as a live album, numerous singles, and a retrospective compilation called &quot;Golden Black&quot;. The band members have also been featured in two B-grade science fiction horror films: &quot;Wild Zero&quot; and &quot;Sore Losers&quot;. A collection of Guitar Wolf&#x27;s most popular videos and live performances have been compiled into a limited-edition DVD titled &quot;Red Idol&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
Guitarist Seiji was born in Nagasaki Prefecture but moved to nearby Shimane Prefecture while he was still young. Upon graduating high school, he moved to Tokyo, where he became lead vocalist for the band Far East Punch. With a strong desire to play guitar, Seiji dedicated himself to the instrument after coming across a copy of the single &quot;Rumble&quot; by Link Wray &amp; His Ray Men at Tower Records in Shibuya. He has stated that the 1958 instrumental &quot;saved his music life&quot;.

Seiji met bassist Billy (Hideaki Sekiguchi) while the two were working in Harajuku. Realizing they shared similar musical tastes, they decided to form a rock band together. After convincing Seiji&#x27;s coworker Narita to accompany them on drums, Guitar Wolf formed in Harajuku in 1987. Each member adopted a Ramones-style surname reflecting the instrument he played: Seiji became Guitar Wolf, Billy became Bass Wolf, and Narita became Drum Wolf, though Narita would depart the group shortly thereafter. For a brief period, Seiji&#x27;s younger brother Masaharu filled in on drums before a drummer, Tōru, was found.

In time, the band would come to develop its own unique strain of punk rock music, fusing multiple genres together into what the band described as &quot;Jet Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Although Guitar Wolf has cited Joan Jett as an important musical and stylistic influence, contrary to some reports, the term &quot;Jet Rock&quot; is not derived from Joan Jett&#x27;s name. The term&#x27;s origin is, rather, attributed to the sound of a jet plane. In an interview conducted in St. Louis on 5 April 2012, Seiji clarified: &quot;I love jet plane. I love noisy music, too. So...there were records...many records...every record have no big sounds. So...&quot;easy&quot; to listen. I hate that! So! I add jet sounds. &quot;Bwaaaahng!&quot; Explosion!&quot; In the same interview, when asked who created the term &quot;Jet Rock&quot;, Seiji replied, &quot;Me. Yeah, yeah. So we are #1 Japanese Jet Rock Band&quot;.

===First releases===
By 1994, the band had released three albums and a single. Their first album, &quot;Wolf Rock!&quot;, was recorded in Seiji&#x27;s basement and released in the US on vinyl by Goner Records. Their second album, &quot;Kung Fu Ramone&quot;, was released through Bag of Hammers; their third, titled &quot;Run Wolf Run&quot;, contains a number of re-recorded tracks from &quot;Kung Fu Ramone&quot;. 1994 also saw the release of their first single, &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else b/w Red Rockabilly&quot;, again through Bag of Hammers.

===Later work===
The period between 1994 and 2000 is when Guitar Wolf released much of their best-known material. In 1996, a performance at a New York City record store secured the band a contract with Matador Records, who issued their fourth album, &quot;Missile Me!&quot;, that same year. Guitar Wolf would continue releasing albums with Matador until 1999&#x27;s &quot;Jet Generation&quot;, an album that the company claimed was the loudest ever put to wax, and which included a warning that playing it could potentially damage the listener&#x27;s audio equipment.

On 24 April 2019, it was announced that Guitar Wolf&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Love &amp; Jett&quot;, would be released on Jack White&#x27;s Third Man Records on 10 May 2019. A US tour with Nashville Pussy was organized to promote the album. In 2022, longtime drummer Toru announced his departure from the band, and his last live performance with Guitar Wolf on 11 March was live-streamed. A drummer named Shingo filled in for a May and June European tour. After the completion of the tour, the band announced Takuro Nagashima as their new drummer.

===Film appearances===
In 2000, Guitar Wolf starred in the Japanese rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll &quot;zombie horror&quot; movie &quot;Wild Zero&quot;, directed by Tetsuro Takeuchi. The band play themselves as they take on crazed fans, zombies, and an alien invasion. Their music also features heavily in the movie&#x27;s soundtrack. A sequel, titled &quot;Wild Zero 2: The Strongest Blood of Humanity&quot;, was announced in July 2019, though no release date has been confirmed as they search for a distributor. The band has also appeared in the documentaries &quot;Get Action!!&quot; (2014, dir. Jun&#x27;ya Kondō) and &quot;Garage Rockin&#x27; Craze&quot; (2017, dir. Mario Cuzic), the former exploring another well-known Japanese garage rock band, Teengenerate, and the latter looking at the formation and evolution of the Tokyo garage punk scene and its de facto founder, DJ Daddy-O-Nov. Both films feature interviews with Seiji and the latter features live footage as well.

===Death of Bass Wolf===
In 2002, the band made the move to Narnack Records, where they continued to release material until 2005. That year, they released the greatest hits album &quot;Golden Black&quot;. Later the same year, after completing a U.S. tour, the band returned to Japan, where bassist Billy suffered a fatal heart attack at the age of 38. In September 2005, Guitar Wolf played their first show with a new bassist, U.G, who would go on to play with the band for the next twelve years, departing in 2017. His replacement, Hikaru, remained with Guitar Wolf for less than a year, before being replaced by current bassist, Gotz.

==Jet clothing==
The band have their own line of clothing, called Jet, consisting of jackets, pants, T-shirts, and belts. The Guitar Wolf motorcycle jacket, a variation of the 613 Perfecto called 613GW, is manufactured by Schott NYC. In 2018, alongside big name Japanese bands The Cro-Magnons, The Bawdies, and Stompin&#x27; Riffraffs, Guitar Wolf headlined Wings, Wheels, &amp; Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll, a show sponsored by British motorcycle jacket maker Lewis Leathers to commemorate the brand opening a Tokyo store. They have since released a model for Guitar Wolf, known as the 723 Memphis.

<doc id="845152" wikidata="Q1227831" url="?curid=845152" title="Ellesmere Chaucer">
<text>The Ellesmere Chaucer, or Ellesmere Manuscript of the Canterbury Tales, is an early 15th-century illuminated manuscript of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, owned by the Huntington Library, in San Marino, California (EL 26 C 9). It is considered one of the most significant copies of the &quot;Tales&quot;.

==History==
Chaucer scholarship has long assumed that no manuscripts of the &quot;Tales&quot; exist dating from earlier than Chaucer&#x27;s death in 1400. The Ellesmere manuscript, conventionally dated to the first decades of the fifteenth century, would therefore be one of the first extant manuscripts of the &quot;Tales&quot;. More recently, the manuscript has been dated to c. 1405 or earlier, leading to speculation that it &quot;was conceived as an immediate response to Chaucer&#x27;s death by those eager to commemorate his memory through the appropriate preservation of his work.&quot; It has even been suggested that, while the final sentence of the manuscript (&quot;Here is ended the Book of the Tales of Canterbury, compiled by Geffrey Chaucer, of whos soule Iesu Crist have mercy. Amen.&quot;) makes it clear that Chaucer had died by the time the manuscript was &quot;finished&quot;, Ellesmere could have been begun while the poet was still alive.

The early history of the manuscript is uncertain, but it seems to have been owned by John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford (1408–1462). The manuscript takes its popular name from the fact that it later belonged to Sir Thomas Egerton (1540–1617), Baron Ellesmere and Viscount Brackley, who apparently obtained it from Roger North, 2nd Baron North (1530/31–1600). The library of manuscripts, known as the Bridgewater Library, remained at the Egerton house, Ashridge, Hertfordshire, until 1802 when it was removed to London. Francis Egerton, created Earl of Ellesmere in 1846, inherited the library, and it remained in the family until its sale to Henry Huntington by John Francis Granville Scrope Egerton (1872–1944), 4th Earl of Ellesmere. Huntington purchased the Bridgewater library privately in 1917 through Sotheby&#x27;s. The manuscript is now in the collection of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California (EL 26 C 9). It was published in facsimile in 1911, then reproduced again in colour in 1995.

Because the manuscript was in the Bridgewater Library for centuries, early scholars working on Chaucer&#x27;s works were unaware of its existence and it was not consulted for any early editions of the &quot;Tales&quot;. It first came to public notice following its description in 1810; the text was not available until 1868, when it was edited by F. J. Furnivall. W. W. Skeat&#x27;s 1894 edition of the &quot;Tales&quot; was the first to use Ellesmere as the basis for its text.

==Description==
The Ellesmere manuscript is a highly polished example of scribal workmanship, with a great deal of elaborate illumination and, notably, a series of illustrations of the various narrators of the &quot;Tales&quot; (including a famous one of Chaucer himself, mounted on a horse). 

The manuscript is written on 240 high-quality parchment leaves of approximately 394mm (13¾&quot;) by 284mm (11¼&quot;) in size.

== Illuminations ==
Owing to the quality of its decoration and illustrations, Ellesmere is the most frequently reproduced Chaucer manuscript.

In order of appearance in the Ellesmere Chaucer (note that not all storytellers have an illumination):

*Knight (fol. 10r)
*Miller (fol. 34v)
*Reeve (fol. 42r)
*Cook (fol. 47r)
*Man of Law (fol. 50v)
*Wife of Bath (fol. 72r)
*Friar (fol. 76v)
*Summoner (fol. 81r)
*Clerk of Oxford (fol. 88r)
*Merchant (fol. 102v)
*Squire (fol. 115v)
*Franklin (fol. 123v)
*Physician (fol. 133r)
*Pardoner (fol. 138r)
*Shipman (fol. 143v)
*Prioress (fol. 148v)
*Chaucer (fol. 153v)
*Monk and his greyhounds (fol. 169r)
*Nun&#x27;s Priest (fol. 179r)
*Second Nun (fol. 187r)
*Canon&#x27;s Yeoman (fol. 194r)
*Manciple (fol. 203r)
*Parson (fol. 206v)

==Scribe and its relation to other manuscripts==

The Ellesmere manuscript is thought to be very early in date, being written shortly after Chaucer&#x27;s death. It is seen as an important source for efforts to reconstruct Chaucer&#x27;s original text and intentions, though John M. Manly and Edith Rickert in their &quot;Text of the Canterbury Tales&quot; (1940) noted that whoever edited the manuscript probably made substantial revisions, tried to regularise spelling, and put the individual Tales into a smoothly running order. Up until this point the Ellesmere manuscript had been used as the &#x27;base text&#x27; by several editions, such as that of W. W. Skeat, with variants checked against British Library, Harley MS 7334.

The manuscript is believed to have been written by a single scribe, the same scribe who wrote the Hengwrt Manuscript of the &quot;Tales.&quot; The scribe has been identified as Adam Pinkhurst, a man employed by Chaucer himself; however, the attribution is controversial, with many palaeographers remaining undecided for or against. If the scribe was employed by Chaucer directly, this would imply that the reconstructions hypothesized by Manly and Rickert were carried out by someone who had worked with Chaucer, knew his intentions for the &quot;Tales&quot;, and had access to draft materials.

The Ellesmere manuscript is conventionally referred to as El in studies of the &quot;Tales&quot; and their textual history. A facsimile edition is available.

<text>Clarence Halliday (Baltimore, July 23, 1898 – Dallas, March 1, 1937), also known as Clarence Holiday, was an American musician. He was the father of the singer Billie Holiday.

==Early life==
In Baltimore he attended a boys&#x27; school with the banjo player Elmer Snowden. Both of them played banjo with various Baltimore jazz bands, including the band of Eubie Blake. At the age of 16, Holiday became the unmarried father of Billie Holiday, who was born to 19-year-old Sarah Fagan (later Sadie Harris). He rarely visited Harris or her daughter. He moved from Baltimore to Philadelphia when he was 21 years old.

==Career==
Holiday played rhythm guitar and banjo as a member of the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra (1928–33). He also recorded with Benny Carter (1934) and Bob Howard (1935) and worked with Charlie Turner (1935), Louis Metcalf (1935–36), and the Don Redman Big Band (1936–37).

==Death==
Holiday died in 1937. He was exposed to mustard gas while serving in World War I. Later, he fell ill with a lung disorder while on tour in Texas and was refused treatment at a local hospital. When he finally managed to get treatment, he was only allowed in the Jim Crow ward of the Veterans Hospital, and by then pneumonia had set in and without antibiotics, the illness was fatal. Two years later Billie Holiday recorded the song “Strange Fruit” in her father&#x27;s memory.

<doc id="845154" wikidata="Q2718121" url="?curid=845154" title="Hengwrt Chaucer">
<text>The Hengwrt Chaucer manuscript is an early-15th-century manuscript of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, held in the National Library of Wales, in Aberystwyth. It is an important source for Chaucer&#x27;s text, and was possibly written by someone with access to an original authorial holograph, now lost.

The &quot;Hengwrt Chaucer&quot; is part of a collection called the Peniarth Manuscripts which is included by UNESCO in its UK Memory of the World Register, a list of documentary heritage which holds cultural significance specific to the UK. It is catalogued as National Library of Wales MS Peniarth 392D. Following the terminology developed by John M. Manly and Edith Rickert, the manuscript is conventionally referred to as Hg in most editions giving variant readings.

==History of the manuscript==
The Hengwrt Chaucer has been in Wales for at least 400 years.
This was one of the collection of manuscripts amassed at the mansion of Hengwrt, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd, by Welsh antiquary Robert Vaughan (c.1592–1667); the collection later passed to the newly established National Library of Wales.

The Hengwrt manuscript&#x27;s very early ownership is unknown, but recent research suggests that Chaucer himself may have partly supervised the making of the manuscript, before his death in October 1400, according to the Welsh newspaper &quot;The Western Mail&quot;.
By the 16th century it can be identified as belonging to Fouke Dutton, a draper of Chester who died in 1558. It then seems to have passed into the ownership of the Bannester family of Chester and Caernarfon, and through them was in the possession of an Andrew Brereton by 1625; by the middle of the 17th century it had been acquired by Vaughan.

==Description==

Peniarth MS 392 D contains 250 folios with a page size of around 29 x 20.5 centimetres (11½&quot; x 8&quot;). It is written on heavily stained and rather damaged parchment. Vermin have eaten around nine centimeters (3½&quot;) from the outer corners of the leaves. It is less complete than the Ellesmere manuscript, and the tales are in an order that is unique to itself. The main textual hand has been identified with one found in several other manuscripts of the period (see below); there are a number of other hands in the manuscript, including one of a person who attempted to fill in several gaps in the text. This has been tentatively identified as the hand of the poet Thomas Hoccleve.

There is some illumination in blue, gold and pink, used on the border and on initial letters at the opening of individual tales and prologues, but the manuscript contains no illustrations.

==Scribe and relationship to other manuscripts==

The Hengwrt manuscript was written by the same scribe as the lavishly illustrated Ellesmere manuscript, which, following the examples of the editors Frederick Furnivall and W. W. Skeat, was thought to be superior to Hengwrt and used as the base text for many modern editions of the &quot;Canterbury Tales.&quot; Since the work of John M. Manly and Edith Rickert in compiling their &quot;Text of the Canterbury Tales&quot; (1940), however, the Hengwrt manuscript has had a much higher degree of prominence in attempts to reconstruct Chaucer&#x27;s text, displacing the previously prominent Ellesmere and Harley MS. 7334. Recent scholarship has shown that the variant spellings given in the Hengwrt manuscript likely reflect Chaucer&#x27;s own spelling practices in his East Midlands / London dialect of Middle English, while the Ellesmere text shows evidence of a later attempt to regularise spelling; Hengwrt is therefore probably very close to the original authorial holograph.

The scribe of the Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts has been identified by Linne Mooney, a palaeographer at the University of York, as Adam Pinkhurst, a documented member of the Worshipful Company of Scriveners. The attribution has been widely accepted, and other manuscripts have since been added to Pinkhurst&#x27;s scribal canon. However, other scholars, including Jane Roberts, who drew Mooney&#x27;s attention to Pinkhurst in the first place, have expressed skepticism about the identification on various palaeographical, literary, and historical grounds.

==Order==
The tales are presented in the following order:
#General Prologue
#The Knight&#x27;s Tale
#The Miller&#x27;s Tale
#The Reeve&#x27;s Tale
#The Cook&#x27;s Tale

<text>KHET (channel 11), branded PBS Hawai&#x27;i, is a PBS member television station in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, serving the Hawaiian Islands. Owned by the Hawaii Public Television Foundation, the station maintains studios on Sand Island Access Road in Honolulu, and its main transmitter is located on Palehua Ridge, north of Makakilo.

The station&#x27;s signal is relayed across the rest of the state outside Oahu and metropolitan Honolulu on full-powered satellite KMEB (channel 10) in Wailuku on Maui (with transmitter at Ulupalakua) and through a network of low-power translators on the other Hawaiian Islands.

==Station history==

KHET signed on the air for the first time on April 15, 1966; KMEB followed on six months later on September 22 of that year. KHET is the second outlet in Honolulu to occupy the channel 11 dial position, the first being KONA-TV from 1952 to 1955, when it moved to channel 2 because the higher VHFs (2 to 6) offered more ERPs at the time; that station is now KHON-TV. Had KONA not moved to channel 2, the channel would have remained a commercial allocation, as the FCC had intended to make channel 7 a non-commercial allocation for Honolulu in the first assignment, but the FCC relocated channel 7 to Wailuku in 1959 and made channel 11 a non-commercial allocation instead (the Wailuku allocation was intended to be on channel 8). Originally known on-air as &quot;Hawaii Educational Television&quot; (or &quot;Hawaii ETV&quot;), it rebranded as &quot;Hawaii Public Television&quot; in 1970 and then became &quot;PBS Hawai&#x27;i&quot; in 2003.

PBS Hawaii had remained one of the few remaining American television stations that continued to sign off during the overnight hours, years after most PBS member stations had transitioned to a 24-hour schedule; until July 14, 2019, its over-the-air broadcast signals transmitted from 5 a.m. to midnight daily, although beginning on July 1, 1996, PBS Hawaii maintained a separate 24-hour-a-day cable feed containing programming from the PBS Satellite Service during the over-the-air signals’ overnight dark period (from midnight to 5 a.m.). On July 15, 2019, coinciding with the launch of its DT3 subchannel (affiliated with PBS Kids 24/7), PBS Hawaii adopted a 24-hour schedule on its broadcast feed: on that date, the member network’s main channel added PBS Satellite Service overnight programming and its DT2 subchannel began offering an expanded schedule of PBS Kids programming in the former downtime.

Original materials from PBS Hawaii have also been contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
Both stations ended regular programming on their analog signals, respectively on January 15, 2009, the date on which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts (almost five months earlier than the June 12 transition date for stations on the U.S. mainland):
* KHET ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 11; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 18 to VHF channel 11.
* KMEB ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 10; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 30 to VHF channel 10.

===Translators===
PBS Hawai&#x27;i operates the following low-power translator stations:
* Anahola
* Hakalau
* Hanalei
* Hilo
* Kilauea
* Lihue
* Mauna Loa
* Naalehu
* South Point

<text>PNS/M &quot;Hangor&quot; (S-131) (nicknamed: &quot;Shark&quot;) was a diesel-electric submarine that served in the Pakistan Navy from 1969 until its decommissioning in 2006. It is the first submarine to sink a ship after World War II.

&quot;Hangor&quot; (S131) was the lead ship of her class, designed and constructed by France after a long and complicated negotiation which started in 1966. In 1969, &quot;Hangor&quot; was commissioned in the Submarine Command (SUBCOM) when she reported back to her home base in Karachi from Paris. &quot;Hangor&quot;, under the command of Commander Ahmed Tasnim, sank the Indian Navy&#x27;s , an anti-submarine frigate, with one homing torpedo on 9 December 1971 during the western front of the third war with India in 1971.

This was the only recorded submarine kill after World War II until the Falklands War, when the Royal Navy&#x27;s nuclear submarine sank the Argentine Navy cruiser . The strategic impact was even more significant as the Indian navy cancelled &quot;Operation Triumph&quot;, the third missile attack, which was to be launched on 10 December.

==Acquisition and initial deployment==

After the second war with Pakistan in 1965, the Indian Navy underwent a rapid modernization and expansion, causing the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s focus to shift towards strengthening their existing Submarine Command (COMSUBS) due to being unable to acquire fighter jets from the Air Force. In 1966, the Ayub administration began the development and acquisition of the from France. France renamed these submarines according to the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s standards. &quot;Hangor&quot; was the lead ship of her class, which included and , all commissioned in 1970.

Training of the crew took place in 1968. Notably, &quot;Hangor&quot;″s officers that served in 1971 included:
*Commander Ahmed Tasnim, the commanding officer. 
*Lieutenant-Commander A. U. Khan, second-in-command and the navigation officer
*Lieutenant-Commander R. A. Kadri, the electrical officer.
*Lieutenant Fasih Bokhari, the navigation officer.

The ship&#x27;s first war-time deployment was in August 1971, gathering intelligence on the Indian Navy and clearing the Manora Island and Ormara Bay in the coastal areas of Pakistan. &quot;Hangor&quot; reported back to base in September 1971 but was again deployed in November 1971.

As Indian covert involvement in the East Pakistan grew, the Navy NHQ in Karachi deployed its only (albeit aging) long-range submarine, , under the command of Z.M. Khan, to pick up intelligence and track the aircraft carrier off the Bay of Bengal in November 1971.

According to Rear-Admiral R. A. Kadri in 1999, the assigned mission was considered quite difficult and dangerous, with the submarine squadron sailing under the assumption that the dangerous nature of this mission meant a great mortal risk to the submarine and her crew.

==Service with Pakistan Navy==
===Western Front of Indo-Pakistani war of 1971===
On the midnight of 26 November 1971, &quot;Hangor&quot; sailed from its base with a load of torpedoes to patrol the Bombay Harbour. Soon after deployment, defects were noted in the ship&#x27;s computers but were soon repaired as the patrol continued. Initially, there were two contacts that were picked up by the computers and were identified as warships, ranging . The ship could not pursue its targets due to the warships&#x27; speed and the distance between them. &quot;Hangor&quot;″s crew did, however, manage to predict the warships&#x27; movements.

At midnight of 2/3 December 1971, &quot;Hangor&quot;, remaining submerged in a northerly direction, investigated radio transmissions intercepted from the warships belonging to the Western Naval Command of the Indian Navy that would launch a first missile attack on Karachi. &quot;Hangor&quot; was passed over by the large Squadron of the Western fleet of the Indian Navy. The cruiser passed directly over the submarine.

All transmissions and computers were shut down to avoid the detection by the Indian fleet, and once passed over Cmdr. Tasnim broke the radio silence and communicated with the Navy NHQ to warn of the attack, but this message was intercepted. On 3 December 1971, the Indian Navy dispatched two ASW frigates, and , under the command of Captain M. N. Mulla.

On 4 December 1971, Navy NHQ communicated with &quot;Hangor&quot;, giving her war codes to attack the Indian Navy&#x27;s armada.

On 9/10 December 1971, at 19:00, &quot;Hangor&quot; detected the possible signature of the two Indian frigates dispatched in response to the intercepted communications. Later, around midnight, Cdr. Tasnim ordered &quot;Hangor&quot; to dive deep to carry out a blind (sonar only) approach as the torpedo team concentrated on tracking the two targets as they gradually came within firing range. At 19:57, the submarine fired a down-the-throat shot with a homing torpedo at &quot;Kirpan&quot; from a depth of . The torpedo was tracked, but no explosion was heard. It was then speculated that the torpedo had missed its target, and the moment &quot;Kirpan&quot; sensed the torpedo, the captain of &quot;Kirpan&quot; realized that the ship was under attack turned away at maximum speed from the scene. &quot;Hangor&quot; had struck first, but had failed to hit hard.

As &quot;Kirpan&quot; fled the battle, &quot;Khukri&quot;, to its south, knowing the direction from which the torpedo had come, increased speed and came straight for an attack on &quot;Hangor&quot;. As &quot;Khukri&quot; came in for an attack, &quot;Hangor&quot;″s attack team shifted targeting to &quot;Khukri&quot;, quickly firing a second torpedo. The second torpedo was fired at the approaching &quot;Khukri&quot; and was followed by a heavy and loud explosion as the torpedo struck the magazine of &quot;Khukri&quot;. Shortly before the impact, &quot;Hangor&quot; detected the direct orders of Captain Mulla ordering evasive manoeuvres.

INS &quot;Kirpan&quot; moved into the scene, hoping to engage &quot;Hangor&quot; with a hasty dropping of the depth charge, but a third torpedo locked onto &quot;Kirpan&quot;″s tail, followed by a loud explosion. &quot;Kirpan&quot; was not sunk but there was a substantial amount of physical damage that led &quot;Kirpan&quot; to flee the battle scene by turning west towards deep waters.

&quot;Hangor&quot; moved into searching for survivors in a hope to rescue but &quot;Khukri&quot; sank in matter of two minutes before &quot;Hangor&quot; could reach it. The casualty roster listed 18 officers and 176 sailors aboard &quot;Khukri&quot; and it remains as the Indian Navy&#x27;s most costly wartime casualty in terms of lives lost. &quot;Kirpan&quot; returned to the scene next day to execute the rescue operation along with INS &quot;Katchal&quot; but left without success.

After this incident, there was a massive search and destroy mission led by the Western Fleet, indiscriminately dropping depth charges hoping to sink &quot;Hangor&quot;. Cdr. Tasnim had &quot;Hangor&quot; submerged for almost a week, returning to its base with depleted lead batteries during the night of 13 December 1971.

According to his personal admission in 2001, Tasnim maintained: &quot;&quot;An extensive air search combined with surface ships made our life miserable but with the intelligent evasive action we managed to survive these attacks and arrived in Karachi safely after the ceasefire&quot;.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Decommissioning and preservation===

Over the successive years, it served in the Navy with distinction until decommissioning in 2006. In a ceremony on 2 January 2006, &quot;Hangor&quot; was decommissioned from the Pakistan Navy; it was soon converted to serve as a museum ship at Pakistan Maritime Museum.

In its memory, Pakistan remembers and celebrates 9 December as Hangor Day.

===Honors and awards===

In recognition of her service, &quot;Hangor&quot; was decorated with multiple gallantry and wartime awards and honors. She is regarded in the Navy as having the highest number of operational gallantry awards given to a single warship of Pakistan Navy.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Hangor&quot; has been featured in a number of Pakistani dramas and films. An example of this is the film &quot;Hangor S-131&quot;.

<text>Elias Levy (also known as Aleph One) is a computer scientist. He was the moderator of &quot;Bugtraq&quot;, a full disclosure vulnerability mailing list, from May 14, 1996 until October 15, 2001.

He was the CTO and co-founder of the computer security company SecurityFocus, which was acquired by Symantec on August 6, 2002. He is also known as the author of the article &quot;Smashing The Stack For Fun and Profit&quot;, published in 1996 &quot;Phrack&quot; magazine issue 49, which was the first high-quality, public, step-by-step introduction to stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities and their exploitation.

After the sale of SecurityFocus to Symantec in August 2002, Levy was accused by many of &quot;selling out&quot; and compromising the high principles of the Bugtraq list. The Full-Disclosure mailing list was founded in part as a protest against the sale.

<text>Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Janashakti, abbreviated CPI (ML) Janashakti, was a communist political party in India. In 2013, CPI (ML) Jansakthi merged into CPIML.

==History==
CPI (ML) Janashakti was formed in 1992 when six revolutionary communist groups merged. The six groups were: 
*Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Resistance
*Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) P.V. Rao (break-away from Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) New Democracy)
*Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Khokan Majumdar
*Communist Revolutionary Group for Unity
*Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries
*A faction of the Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist–Leninist)

CPI (ML) Janashakti is mostly based in the revolutionary tradition of Andhra Pradesh, with the mass line developed by Chandra Pulla Reddy and T. Nagi Reddy, legends of the Telangana Rebellion. The party followed a combination of both armed underground and parliamentary methods of struggle. Initially things went well for the party, and in the 1994 assembly elections of Andhra Pradesh Vidhan Sabha it won a seat. It had launched 13 candidates in all and won the Sirsilla assembly seat in Karimnagar district. N. V. Krishnaiah was the candidate who won the Sirsilla seat.

A trade union, All India Federation of Trade Unions, and a peasants movement were built up.

But the unity did not last for long. In 1996 a group left the party, and they later formed Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Unity Initiative (today part of Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) (Kanu Sanyal)). A series of splits followed. Towards the end of the 1990s the party reoriented itself towards the underground armed struggle, and pulled out of the open mass work.

==Modern==
Today the party is primarily concentrated in Andhra Pradesh. The party split into several factions, which work with little or without coordination. The main faction is the group led by Koora Rajanna. COM.Subhash is the Andhra Pradesh state secretary of the party. The All India secretary of the party is COM.Misro 
The party conducts armed struggle through &quot;dalams&quot;. Police sources has claimed that CPI (ML) Janashakti has 200 to 300 armed cadres.

One break-away group is Communist Party of United States of India (also referred to as the Janashakti Veeranna faction).

Another faction, the South Regional Provincial Committee, merged with Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) (Chandra Pulla Reddy) on 11 April 2004, thus forming the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Janashakti (Chandra Pulla Reddy).

Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, CPI (ML) Janashakti signed a joint boycott declaration together with the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People&#x27;s War and the MCC(I).

On 23 September 2004, the Andhra Pradesh state government declared they would hold peace talks with CPI (ML) Janashakti and Peoples War Group. These peace talks went in vain when both the government and the revolutionary parties did not hold trust in the other. Later Koora Rajanna was arrested by the police in Uttar Pradesh state of India and was sent to Warangal central jail. Many cases that were booked on Koora Rajanna were cancelled for lack of proper evidences.

In 2007 Virasam AP state secretary was affiliated with CPI (M-L) Janashakti. He was also arrested in July 2009 and Adhikaara Pratinidhi Azaad (Com. Subhash) became AP state secretary. The party had a leading role in the Andhra Pradesh revolutionary movement. AP State Committee of Janasakthi declared that Mr. Koora Rajanna was not a member of CPI(M-L) Janashakti. In April 2011 at Guntur district of AP, 7 members of CPI (M-L) Janashakti were arrested and 2dbbl guns, one 8mm rifle, one 9mm pistol, and two tapanchas were lost at this incident.

In June 2011, Party bulletin &quot;Janashakti&quot; (People&#x27;s Unity) released in Telugu. Today party is organising under the name of CPI (M-L) Janashakti Re-Organising Committee. This group also tries to merge with CPI (M-L) Praja Prathighatana.

In June 2011, majority members of the Andhra Regional Committee of CPI (M-L) Praja Prathighatana, under the presidency of Com. Vijayakumar, joined to CPI (M-L) Janasakthi.

In 2013, CPI (ML) Jansakthi merged into CPIML.

<text>The Ship Canal Bridge is a double-deck steel truss bridge that carries Interstate 5 (I-5) over Seattle&#x27;s Portage Bay (part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, after which it is named) between Capitol Hill and the University District. The canal below connects Lake Union with Lake Washington. Construction was completed in 1961 and the bridge opened to traffic on December 18, 1962. It is 4,429 ft (1,350 meters) long, stands 182 feet above the canal and is 119 feet wide at the upper deck. It was the largest bridge of its kind in the Northwest when it first opened. The bridge is double-decked, with the upper deck carrying traffic in both directions and the lower deck (the express lanes) carrying traffic southbound in the morning and northbound in the afternoon.

Other nearby bridges include University Bridge, Montlake Bridge, and George Washington Memorial Bridge (the Aurora Ave. bridge).

<text>American Flagg! is an American comic book series created by writer-artist Howard Chaykin, published by First Comics from 1983 to 1989. A science fiction series and political satire, it was set in the U.S., particularly Chicago, Illinois, in the early 2030s. Writers besides Chaykin included Steven Grant, J.M. DeMatteis, Alan Moore and John Francis Moore.

==Publication history==
&quot;American Flagg&quot;, which ran 50 issues (October 1983 – March 1988), was one of the first titles to be published by First Comics, an early alternative press comics company founded in Evanston, Illinois in 1983. Unusually for the time, the company offered its freelance writers and artists creator rights, including ownership of their creations. Regardless, writer-artist Howard Chaykin, then living in New York City, felt trepidation when First Comics approached him to do a project. He recalled in 2010:

Chaykin devised a series set in 2031, a high-tech but spiritually empty, consumerist world in which the American government has relocated to Mars, leaving what remains of the U.S. to be governed by the all-encompassing corporation known as the Plex. The series star is Reuben Flagg, a former TV star drafted into the Plexus Rangers and posted as a deputy in Chicago, Illinois.

The first 12 issues, running through cover-date September 1984, consisted of four interlocking, three-issue story arcs. Chaykin recalled his difficulty in producing 28 pages of art and script monthly: &quot;I was still a smoker and a drinker at the time. And [the output was such that] I&#x27;d never done anything like that before, and it was insane. It just devoured my life [and] I had no assistants. I didn&#x27;t know how to work with an assistant at that point, and it was a very difficult process. ... I was trying to do a fairly high-quality product and I didn&#x27;t want to slough it off&quot;.

Chaykin made wide use of Craftint Duoshade illustration boards for &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, which in the period before computers, enabled him to add shaded textures to the finished art. Ken Bruzenak&#x27;s lettering and logowork also won notice, as it was integral to &quot;American Flagg&quot;&#x27;s futuristic, trademark-littered ambiance.

&quot;American Flagg&quot;&#x27;s first dozen issues form one complete story that has influenced comic creators including Brian Michael Bendis and Warren Ellis. The comic made a huge splash at the 1984 Eagle Awards, the United Kingdom&#x27;s pre-eminent comics awards. Chaykin and &quot;American Flagg!&quot; were nominated for ten awards, eventually winning seven. &quot;American Flagg!&quot; also won the 1983 Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Comic Book and tied for the 1983 CBG Award for Favorite Character (Reuben Flagg).

After issue #12, Chaykin continued the series while also working on such other projects as his revamp of &quot;The Shadow&quot; for DC Comics and the graphic novel &quot;Time2&quot;, based on characters introduced in a one-off &quot;American Flagg!&quot; special in 1986. During this time, Alan Moore wrote a back-up story that ran several issues and concluded in an issue-length story.

Eventually, Chaykin left, to be replaced on a regular basis by first Steven Grant then J.M. DeMatteis. Grant left after only seven issues due to creative friction with the series&#x27;s new artist, Mark Badger. According to Grant, he had wanted to continue doing stories in the same style that Chaykin had established, while Badger wanted to take the series in new directions. Chaykin returned for a brief run to wrap up storylines before the first volume ended in March 1988. The title was relaunched a few months later as &quot;Howard Chaykin&#x27;s Amerikan Flagg!&quot;. This run saw Chaykin return to write the first issue before handing over to John Francis Moore, with Mike Vosburg and Richard Ory penciling and inking the interior art, but the franchise failed to recapture its early success and was canceled after 12 issues.

==Plot synopsis==
The story takes place in the year 2031, after a series of worldwide crises called the Year of the Domino (1996) has forced the U.S. government and the heads of major corporations to relocate to Hammarskjold Center, on Mars (&quot;temporarily, of course&quot;). In the wake of the American government leaving the planet and the Soviet Union collapsing from Islamic insurrections, there was a power shift throughout the world, with Brazilian Union of the Americas and the Pan-African League becoming the new superpowers on Earth.

However, the exiled American government, its corporate backers, and a group of technicians in the defected Soviet lunar colony of Gagaringrad form the Plex: a giant, interplanetary union of corporate and government concerns that conduct commerce and govern the United States from its capital on Mars. Many population centers are grouped around massive, fortified arcologies called Plexmalls and the law is enforced by the Plexus Rangers, the absentee Plex&#x27;s Earthside militia.

The Plex has formed the Tricentennial Recovery Committee, to get America &quot;back on track for &#x27;76&quot;, but the TRC is in reality a plan to sell the United States off to the new superpowers and to leech off the remaining inhabitants before gaining true self-sufficiency. As a result, the Plex has outlawed non-combat related education, organized sports such as basketball and personal aircraft, restricted media to only one outlet, the Plex itself (although it has multiple channels), and advocates and glorifies the use of political violence amongst independent policlubs by providing money and firearms for its hit TV show &quot;Firefight All Night LIVE!&quot;, and covertly sterilizes the population by using a combination contraceptive and antibiotic called Mañanacillin to reduce the population.

This all changes when former television star Reuben Flagg is drafted and transferred to Chicago&#x27;s Plexmall to replace the local Ranger Hilton &quot;Hammerhead&quot; Krieger&#x27;s fallen partner. He witnesses widespread graft and corruption throughout the Plexmall, but also a series of subliminal messages implanted in a television show that are causing outbreaks of gang violence. After he uses his emergency powers to interrupt the broadcast, he not only ends the violence, but also brings forth a series of events that causes the Plex to send in covert agents, the death of Hilton, and the unveiling of Q-USA, a secret TV station owned and operated by Krieger that opens Flagg&#x27;s eyes to the nature of the Plex.

As the series progressed, Chaykin took less and less of a direct role in scripting and plotting the stories out, and by the third year of its run, he really had nothing to do with the book other than cover art. Stories began to violate the rules that Chaykin had explicitly stated in the writer&#x27;s bible for the series (for instance, California was said to have slid into the Pacific Ocean, but in the final year of the book, California was merely shown to have been abandoned for reasons that were vague at best), and characterizations began to drift considerably as well. (Among other things, Flagg abandoned his interest in 1930s jazz, and was frequently shown listening to late-1960s rock, as well as becoming more of a traditional stern-jawed good-guy hero). After trying and failing several times to shore up declining interests, First Comics decided to lure Chaykin back into the writer&#x27;s seat. &quot;American Flagg!&quot; wrapped up its principal storyline with issue #50. By this time, Reuben Flagg had traveled to Mars, overthrown the Plex, and become President of the United States. He then decided to separate Illinois from the United States and run it as his own personal fiefdom. All issues of this series took place in the year 2031.

The next year, the comic was re-launched under the name &quot;Howard Chaykin&#x27;s Amerikan Flagg!&quot; (The &quot;K&quot; and a reversed &quot;r&quot; were to reflect the fact that most of this series took place in Russia) and picked up from where the earlier book had left off (in 2032). There is some difference of opinion as to whether this new book was intended to be a limited run, or open-ended as is the norm with comics. In either case, it ended after twelve issues. The final issue ends with a photo album of the Flagg&#x27;s future domestic life, with many kids, a screaming shrew of a wife, and a balding, overweight Flagg.

==Characters==
*Reuben Flagg, born in 2000 at Hammarskjold Center, Mars, to Axel and Rebecca Flagg, was a stand-up comic and popular television star of the show &quot;Mark Thrust, Sexus Ranger&quot;. After he was made superfluous by CGI technology, he joined the Plexus Rangers and emigrated to Earth, being stationed in the Chicago Plexmall. Flagg is Jewish, and his parents&#x27; &quot;undesirably bohemian&quot; attitudes have given him an idealistic view of the United States that runs contrary to the Plex. He has a desire to set things right again, and through inheriting Q-USA, begins to set on that path.
*Raul the cat, an intelligent, talking orange tabby housecat. With the exception of his intelligence and his ability to speak (an ability whose origin is never explained), he appears to be otherwise a normal house pet. However, he has a customized set of cybernetic gloves, designed by Mandy Krieger, that give him opposable thumbs.
*Hilton &quot;Hammerhead&quot; Krieger, was Flagg&#x27;s superior at the Chicago Plexmall. A co-founder of the Genetic Warlords motorcycle gang along with Charles Blitz, but after his 13th arrest, the Plex drafts him because of his criminal experience. Intending to take advantage of the fledgling organization, he meets his future wife Peggy and stays with the Rangers. He does not trust anyone, not C.K., the mayor, not his wife Peg, not his daughter Mandy, and, while a Plexus Ranger, he especially does not trust the Plex. He runs an underground television station called Q-USA that broadcasts illegal sports, pornography, and pre-collapse movies and television shows. He is killed by a Plex secret agent, and his cat Raul gives Flagg the keys to the station. He also leaves behind a video explaining to his &quot;heir&quot; the truth of the Plex and the rules he wishes his successor to follow.
*Amanda &quot;Mandy&quot; Krieger, daughter of Hilton, she is the air traffic controller for O&#x27;Hare Chicago Plexport. However, since the O&#x27;Hare Plexport only receives two flights a week, Mandy spends her time tinkering with electronics or getting into mischief. She later becomes a deputy to Flagg.
*Jules &quot;Deathwish&quot; Folquet, captain of the Skokie Skullcrushers basketball team. Despite his punk appearance, his hulking size and the extreme nature of the sport he plays, Jules is quite intelligent. He is referred to as the &quot;king of the two finger lobotomy.&quot; He first teams with Flagg to resolve a hostage crisis, but later forms the Video Rangers auxiliaries, and then becomes a Ranger deputy. He also later hosts a talk show with Raul called the &quot;Him and It Show&quot;. In the second series, he renounces his violent ways, and, through a remarkable series of events, becomes Pope.
*Charles Keenan Blitz, also known as The Honorable C.K. Blitz, a co-founder of the Genetic Warlords along with Hilton Krieger, also ended up getting drafted into the Plexus Rangers, but ended up leaving to become mayor of Chicago. Blitz has his hand in every deal, regardless of how illegal it may be; is extremely wealthy and corrupt; and has killed political opponents. As a side venture, he runs the Skokie Skullcrushers blackmarket basketball team. He is usually flanked by his two robot bodyguards, Bert and Ernie, named after &quot;a private joke no one under 40 understands&quot;. He has had affairs with Mandy Krieger and with Peggy Krieger, while Hilton was fighting a brushfire war in Carracas, which lead to her being kicked out by Hilton and giving birth to Medea Blitz.
*Medea Blitz, the offspring of C.K. and Peggy. Early in the series, Medea is a wild child and hangs out with Cyril Farid-Khan, gang leader of current Genetic Warlords. She has a secret affair with Hilton Krieger, but after his murder, is considered a suspect and is involved in a traffic accident, which causes her to miscarry Krieger&#x27;s child. In order to clean up her act, C.K. Blitz has her join the Plexus Rangers to straighten her out. As the series progresses, Medea is shown to become more and more accepting of the Rangers and becomes a decent team player in Flagg&#x27;s group.
*Sam Luis Obispo also known as Ned Beaumont, also known as Tom Slick. A hustler Reuben meets in Havana while escorting the Skokie Skullcrushers, he later partners with Flagg for most of his time in South America. He has an affair with the wealthy daughter of the Brazilian ambassador, which causes all sorts of problems for Flagg and himself.
*William Windsor-Jones, but his best friends just call him Bill. Bill is the youngest member of the Witnesses, a gang of octogenarian rebels. He helps Flagg out from time to time, giving him intelligence and technical support. He later has become a newscaster for Q-USA. Bill is Prince William, and the rightful heir to the now-abolished British throne.
*Luther Ironheart, a robotic Plexus Ranger with a head that consisted of a holographic projection. He is assigned to be Reuben Flagg&#x27;s partner on patrol. While not very bright, he exhibited superhuman strength and agility.

==Collected editions==

<text>Sam Davis (October 6, 1842 – November 27, 1863) was a Confederate soldier executed by Union forces in Pulaski, Tennessee, during the American Civil War. He is popularly known as the &quot;Boy Hero of the Confederacy&quot;, although he was 21 when he died. He became a celebrated instance of Confederate memorialization in the late 1890s and early 1900s, eulogized by Middle Tennesseeans for his valor and sacrifice. Davis&#x27; story was popularized by editor J. B. Killebrew and later by Sumner Archibald Cunningham.

==Early life==
Born October 6, 1842, in Rutherford County, Tennessee, he was the oldest son of Charles Lewis Davis and Jane (Simmons) Davis. The Davis family owned fifty-one enslaved people by 1860. As a boy Sam Davis was gifted his own enslaved person, named Coleman Davis. He attended school in Smyrna, Tennessee, and was educated at the Western Military Institute—now Montgomery Bell Academy—from 1860–61. While there he came under the influence of headmaster and future Confederate General Bushrod Johnson.

He was recruited by Confederate scout forces early in the Civil War. He signed up as a private in the 1st Tennessee Infantry Regiment in 1861 and his regiment first fought in the Battle of Cheat Mountain; then in the Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1862; then in the Battle of Shiloh; and finally the Battle of Perryville. Davis suffered minor injuries at Shiloh, and suffered a more severe wound at Perryville. After recovering he took on very active service as a courier for Coleman&#x27;s Scouts.

==Capture and trial==
Davis was captured near Minor Hill, Tennessee, on November 20, 1863, having been detailed for special, hazardous duty within the Union lines of occupation around Nashville. At the time of his arrest by Union secret service agents, Davis had in his possession a miscellany of newspapers and intelligence sources, which included detailed drawings of Union fortifications at Nashville and other towns in Middle Tennessee.

Imprisoned in Pulaski, which at that time was a garrisoned Union town under command of General Grenville M. Dodge, Davis faced charges of espionage and steadfastly refused to reveal the names of his informants. After Davis was found guilty, General Dodge announced that he should be hanged on a hill described by a report from the Cincinnati Daily Commercial as &quot;a pretty eminence, north east of Pulaski, and overlooking the town.&quot; When local citizens protested at so visual a display of a gruesome act, Dodge allegedly replied, &quot;I want him hung where you all can see him.&quot;

According to the newspaper account, which is corroborated by several eyewitness accounts recorded between 1862 and the 1890s, Dodge offered Davis his life in exchange for information about his informants. The condemned man apparently refused all such offers. &quot;Would &quot;you&quot; betray a friend?&quot; Davis is reported to have said while seated on his coffin. &quot;I had rather die a thousand deaths.&quot; Confederate lore had Davis saying upon climbing the scaffold that &quot;the boys will have to fight the battles without me.&quot;

== Execution ==
Davis was hanged by Union forces in Pulaski, Tennessee, on November 27, 1863. As he was trundled along to the hanging site atop his own coffin, Union soldiers alongside the bumpy wagon road shouted out their entreaties for his cooperation, lest they have to watch the grim execution. Supposedly the officer in charge of the execution was discomfited by Davis&#x27; youth and calm demeanor and had trouble carrying out his orders. Davis is alleged to have said to him, &quot;Officer, I did my duty. Now, you do yours.&quot;

Accounts of Davis&#x27; death appeared in writings by Union soldiers, who witnessed the execution, and by a journalist from the Cincinnati &quot;Daily Commercial&quot;. Bearing his fate bravely, Davis apparently touched upon the sympathies of all observers, including his captors. The reporter recorded the scene thus:

After a white hood was tied over Davis&#x27; head, the trap door was sprung at 10:30 a.m. Union soldiers turned away as Davis writhed in death agony for three minutes. &quot;He stood it like a man,&quot; one Union soldier noted in his diary the following day. &quot;He never paled a bit but stood it like a hero.&quot; That night, the &quot;Daily Commercial&quot; reported, &quot;evergreens were planted, and now sigh in the wild wintery winds o&#x27;er his grave, while flowers culled by fair hands, were strewn upon it.&quot;

Davis wrote a letter to his mother before his execution, &quot;Dear mother. O how painful it is to write you! I have got to die to-morrow --- to be hanged by the Federals. Mother, do not grieve for me. I must bid you good-bye forevermore. Mother, I do not fear to die. Give my love to all.&quot; There was a postscript for his father, too. &quot;&quot;Father, you can send after my remains if you want to do so. They will be at Pulaski, Tenn. I will leave some things with the hotel keeper for you.&quot;

The execution gained some notoriety at the time, especially among soldiers of the Army of Tennessee. Writing in his memoir &quot;Co. Aytch&quot;, published in the early 1880s, Private Sam Watkins recalled that in 1864 his regiment had assembled to watch the hanging of two young Yankee spies, eager to see the condemned men suffer because &quot;they had hung one of our regiment at Pulaski – Sam Davis.&quot;

== To rescue from oblivion ==
 Sam Davis&#x27; execution was not that unusual an event. Davis suffered a fate shared by many intelligence gatherers operating around Nashville. Most of the rural counties surrounding Nashville were only nominally under Union control, and this &#x27;no-man&#x27;s land&#x27; witnessed over three years of bloody internecine conflict and the steady dissolution of the institution of slavery. In this context, execution for espionage was not uncommon. The Provost Marshal records for Middle Tennessee offer evidence of scores of execution on espionage charges, with not all the victims receiving trials (as Davis did). Six months before Davis&#x27;s execution, Union commanders publicly executed Joseph Smith in Carthage, a rural town east of Nashville. As was the case with Davis, some of these events generated newspaper coverage and featured in private letters. Most executions, however, went unrecorded apart from a perfunctory note in the Provost Marshal&#x27;s records. Today, nearly all of these men are forgotten – except for Sam Davis.

For nearly thirty years after the war, the story of Sam Davis&#x27;s execution was not widely remembered. In 1866 Davis&#x27;s father erected the first monument to his son, a twenty-five foot shaft of Italian marble, at the back of the family&#x27;s plantation home outside Smyrna. The Sam Davis story became part of a broader social memory only in the mid-1890s and chiefly through the efforts of Andrew Cunningham, the founding editor of &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot; magazine. A native of Middle Tennessee, Cunningham had an undistinguished record of Confederate service, having deserted the Army of Tennessee after the Battle of Nashville in 1864. After the war he worked as a newspaperman before becoming the general agent for the Jefferson Davis Memorial Fund after the former Confederate president&#x27;s death in 1889. He left this position shortly after launching the Nashville-based &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot; in January 1893.

Before he founded the &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot;, Cunningham had never heard of Sam Davis. When an early subscriber to the magazine submitted a school oration about Davis for publication, Cunningham rejected it, &quot;feeling that there were so many equally worthy heroes it would hardly be fair to print this special eulogy.&quot; But at a Blue-Gray veterans reunion in April 1895, on the battlefield at Shiloh, Cunningham again heard about the story of Davis&#x27;s execution – and this time from two federal veterans, witnesses to the execution, who claimed, as Cunningham phrased it, that &quot;the Federal Army was in grief over it.&quot; These accounts struck a chord and convinced Cunningham of the merits of publicizing the story. The Union veterans&#x27; story of an ordinary soldier&#x27;s heroic death, couched in the language of reconciliation, fit perfectly with the spirit of the times and the viewpoint of the &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot;. &quot;I resolved to print the story,&quot; Cunningham recalled in 1899, &quot;and [to] reprint it until that typical hero should have as full credit as the &quot;Veteran&quot; could give him.&quot;

As Cunningham assumed stewardship of the Sam Davis story he transformed oral memories into a broad collective memory through a series of promotions. First, he solicited written versions of the federal eyewitness accounts of Davis&#x27;s execution that he had heard at the Shiloh reunion and then published them in the &quot;Veteran.&quot; Next, Cunningham called for Tennesseans to come forward with &quot;such data as may be recalled by all who know anything of the event.&quot; Sensing an opportunity to galvanize interest in his fledgling publication, Cunningham threw his energies into sponsorship of the Sam Davis story. In a series of editorials published in the summer of 1895, Cunningham packaged Davis&#x27;s sacrifice in Christian terms, insisting that the story recalled &quot;the sacrifice of the Galilean whose hands and feet were nailed to a cross.&quot; By summer&#x27;s end, Cunningham launched a fundraising drive for a monument to Davis&#x27;s memory to be erected on the Tennessee State Capitol grounds in Nashville.

Before being popularized by Cunningham, editor J. B. Killebrew in 1871 wrote a tribute to Davis entitled &quot;Every Inch a Hero,&quot; that was widely printed. The article presented Davis as a scout carrying letters, rather than a spy, and because of this his execution was a miscarriage of justice].

==Legacy==
 Since the late 1890s, Davis has towered above any other Tennessean in the pantheon of Confederate Civil War heroes. Today, representations of the life and death of Sam Davis mark the historical and geographical landscapes of the Middle Tennessee heartland. While the narrative of Davis is an ingrained part of regional recognition, Davis&#x27; story did not spread beyond Tennessee despite efforts after World War II to give the story a wider circulation.

Monuments commemorating him stand at the scene of his execution and on the court square in Pulaski; at his childhood home outside Smyrna, Tennessee; and in the form of a life-size statue positioned prominently on the southeast corner of the state capitol grounds in Nashville.

An exhibition case of Sam Davis artifacts—including the overcoat worn at the time of his arrest and the boot in which papers were concealed—is on permanent display at the Tennessee State Museum. Over the years, archivists at the Tennessee State Library and Archives have procured and catalogued scores of documents: firsthand recollections, poems, commemorative speeches, at least four published biographies, and the papers of the Sam Davis Memorial Association.

In 1912 a Sam Davis memorial window was installed in the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond.

In 1927, the State of Tennessee purchased the Davis family home as a memorial site. Operated as a private nonprofit by the Sam Davis Memorial Association, the Sam Davis House outside Smyrna is open to tourists and school groups.
In 1928 the 175-foot-tall, 200-room Sam Davis Hotel opened in downtown Nashville. On February 16, 1985 it was demolished to make way for a new convention center parking garage.

Illustrated Features Syndicate created a newspaper comic strip, &quot;The Story of Sam Davis&quot; in the late 1940s or early 1950s. The strip portrayed Davis, looking remarkably like Clark Gable, as an all–American hero caught up in a tragic era.

In the 1950s the &quot;Sam Davis Story&quot; was turned into a theatrical production performed to packed houses in Nashville, and later became the basis of a radio drama broadcast to U.S. troops overseas under the title &quot;Honor Bound&quot;.

The Sons of Confederate Veterans posthumously awarded Davis their Confederate Medal of Honor, created in 1977.

Davis was named &quot;Historical Personality of the Year&quot; in 1992 by the Tennessee Historical Commission.

== Controversy ==
 Sam Davis&#x27;s youth and the manner of his death has meant that the statue in his memory within the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol has drawn little of the criticism and protest that in recent times has been targeted towards Confederate statues. In 1999, however, the Black Caucus of Tennessee state legislators erected a monument within fifteen feet of the Davis statue to the victims of the Middle Passage who died en route to slavery in the Americas. This drew protests from the Sons of Confederate Veterans who called the proximate placement of the monument to the Davis statue &quot;a foolish little sophomoric prank.&quot; A spokesperson for the Black Caucus claimed no intent &quot;to disrespect a Confederate soldier or have it overshadow him in any way&quot; adding that the location for the monument to slavery&#x27;s victims within the State Capitol grounds was determined by horticultural factors alone.

In 1992 the Sam Davis Memorial Association, who manage the Sam Davis Home on behalf of the State of Tennessee, were inundated with complaints from Confederate supporters angered by the rumor that the battle flag of the Confederacy no longer flew at the Sam Davis Home. The Association responded that &quot;the only trouble we have is trying to satisfy different demands over which Confederate flag should be flown on a regular basis. At the present time, in an attempt to please as many of our supporters as possible, the several Confederate flags are flown on a rotating basis; but a Confederate flag is always flown.&quot;

In the early 2000s historical archaeologists at Middle Tennessee State University criticised the &quot;shrine mentality&quot; and cited a lack of authenticity in the material culture and historical interpretation at the Sam Davis Home. The custodians of the home complained about policy changes that were inconsistent with the original purpose of the home – including the flying of the U.S. flag, which the Nashville chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy called &quot;an insult, not only to Sam Davis and his Family, but to the entire Confederacy and its descendants.&quot;

In recent years the Sam Davis Home has run educational programs focused on the material culture of the mid-nineteenth century, Civil War medicine, the music of enslaved people, and the lives of soldiers and civilians during the Civil War.

In 2020, following the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, Montgomery Bell Academy removed their statue of Sam Davis from the campus, citing Davis&#x27;s association with the Confederacy and the perception that the statue supported racism.

<doc id="845205" wikidata="Q7275353" url="?curid=845205" title="RAF Greenham Common">
<text>Royal Air Force Greenham Common or more simply RAF Greenham Common is a former Royal Air Force station in the civil parishes of Greenham and Thatcham in the English county of Berkshire. The airfield was southeast of Newbury, about west of London.

Opened in 1942, it was used by the United States Air Force during the Second World War and during the Cold War, and later as a base for nuclear weapons. After the Cold War ended, it was closed in September 1992. The airfield was also known for the Greenham Common Women&#x27;s Peace Camp held outside its gates in the 1980s in protest against the stationing of cruise missiles on the base. In 1997 Greenham Common was designated as public parkland.

==History==
===Second World War===
The Greenham Lodge Estate, which was set in the midst on Greenham Common, was requisitioned by the Air Ministry in 1941.

The first arrival was the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) 51st Troop Carrier Wing Headquarters, arriving in September 1942. The 51st TCW controlled the three troop carrier groups at RAF Keevil (62nd TCG), RAF Aldermaston (60th TCG) and RAF Ramsbury (64th TCG) as part of Twelfth Air Force. An area to the east of Bowdown House, a mansion on the northeast end of the airfield, was used as &quot;bomb stores&quot;.

The 51st TCW HQ followed its groups to North Africa as part of Operation Torch in November 1942.

In late 1943, Greenham Common airfield was turned over to the USAAF Ninth Air Force. An American advance party soon arrived to ready the airfield for the incoming units. Greenham Common was known as USAAF Station AAF-486.

====354th Fighter Group====

As troop carrier groups began arriving in the UK in late 1943 and deployed in the Greenham area, Greenham Common was one of the airfields used by the Ninth Air Force for fighter groups arriving from the United States. On 4 November the 354th Fighter Group arrived from Portland Army Air Field, Oregon and they were informed they were to fly the North American P-51 Mustang. The unit transferred to RAF Lashenden in April 1944.

====368th Fighter Group====
A few weeks later on 13 January 1944, the 368th Fighter Group arrived from Farmingdale, New York, flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. They had the following fighter squadrons and fuselage codes:
* 395th Fighter Squadron (A7)
* 396th Fighter Squadron (C2)
* 397th Fighter Squadron (D3)

The 368th was a group of Ninth Air Force&#x27;s 71st Fighter Wing, IX Tactical Air Command. The 368th FG moved to RAF Chilbolton on 15 March 1944.

==== 438th Troop Carrier Group ====

Literally as the 368th FG was moving out, the 438th Troop Carrier Group was flying into Greenham Common from RAF Langar. Flying Douglas C-47 Skytrains, they had the following Troop Carrier squadrons and fuselage codes:
* 87th Troop Carrier Squadron (3X)
* 88th Troop Carrier Squadron (M2)
* 89th Troop Carrier Squadron (4U)
* 90th Troop Carrier Squadron (Q7)
* 94th Troop Carrier Squadron (D8)
The 438th was a group of Ninth Air Force&#x27;s 53rd Troop Carrier Wing of IX Troop Carrier Command. The unit moved to Prosnes in France in February 1945.

===Cold War===
====Strategic Air Command====
In the post-Second World War years, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) of the United States Air Force (USAF) was based at three major airfields in eastern England: RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall and RAF Sculthorpe. The increasing tension of the Cold War led to a re-evaluation of these deployments and a move further west, behind RAF fighter forces, to RAF Greenham Common, RAF Brize Norton, RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Fairford. The airfield came under SAC&#x27;s 7th Air Division, with the 3909th Combat Support Group as its administrative unit on the base, responsible for all non-flying activities as well as maintenance and logistical support of the flying units attached to RAF Greenham Common. One of the first deployments was 310th Bombardment Wing which arrived with its Boeing B-47E Stratojets in October 1956.

=====Nuclear accident=====

On 28 February 1958, a B-47E, of the 310th Bombardment Wing developed problems shortly after takeoff and jettisoned its two 1,700 gallon external fuel tanks. They missed their designated safe impact area, and one hit a hangar while the other struck the ground behind a parked plane. The parked B-47E, registration 53-6216, which was fuelled and had a pilot on board, was engulfed by flames; two ground crew were killed and two were injured.

Two scientists, F. H. Cripps and A. Stimson, who both worked for the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, stated in a secret 1961 report, released by the CND in 1996, that the fire detonated the high explosives in a nuclear weapon, that plutonium and uranium oxides were spread over a wide area (foliage up to 8 mi (13 km) away was contaminated with uranium-235) and that they had discovered high concentrations of radioactive contamination around the airfield.

However, a radiological survey commissioned in 1997 by Newbury District Council and Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council found no evidence of a nuclear accident at Greenham Common, suggesting that Cripps and Stimson&#x27;s statements were false. The seven-month-long survey was carried out by the Geosciences Advisory Unit of Southampton University and combined a helicopter-mounted gamma ray detector survey with a ground-based survey. The team analysed nearly 600 samples taken from soil, lake sediment, borehole water, house dust, runway tarmac and concrete, looking for uranium and plutonium isotopes. No evidence of an accident involving nuclear weapons damage was found at the former air force base although the ground survey detected some low-level uranium contamination around the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston thought to be derived from that facility, and the helicopter survey found some anomalies around Harwell Laboratory.

====United States Air Forces in Europe====
After Strategic Air Command left Greenham Common in 1964, the site was primarily used as a mail sorting and storage facility under the administrative control of 7551st Combat Support Group. Beginning in 1973 the base became the home of the International Air Tattoo, a large scale international military airshow.

====501st Tactical Missile Wing====
Following the 1979 NATO Double-Track Decision, in June 1980, RAF Greenham Common was selected as one of two British bases for the USAF&#x27;s mobile nuclear armed BGM-109G Gryphon Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM). This missile was derived from the sea-launched Tomahawk Land Attack Missile. Some missiles were deployed at RAF Molesworth, but the majority of GLCMs were deployed at RAF Greenham Common.

A Greenham Common Women&#x27;s Peace Camp was established in protest at the deployment of cruise missiles in 1981. The protestors became known as &quot;the Greenham women&quot; or &quot;peace women&quot;, and their 19-year protest drew worldwide media and public attention.

After being equipped with the new weapons, the 501st Tactical Missile Wing was activated at Greenham Common on 1 July 1982. Following the ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and the General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev in June 1988, the last GLCMs at RAF Greenham Common were removed in March 1991, and the 501st Tactical Missile Wing was inactivated in May 1991. On 11 September 1992, the USAF returned RAF Greenham Common to the Ministry of Defence.

===Post RAF station===
In 1997 Greenham Common was designated as public parkland, effectively returning it to its pre-Second World War status but with restrictions. Greenham and Crookham Commons became a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Cold War era control tower has recently been redeveloped and is now open as a visitor centre with a historical exhibition and community cafe. Cattle from local farms are permitted to graze the Common and often stray onto the adjacent Burys Bank Road.

== Greenham Common Control Tower ==

Following the closure of RAF Greenham Common in 1992, one of the few remaining buildings from the former air base was the Control Tower, situated on the north side of the runway. This was left derelict until Greenham Parish Council bought it in April 2014 with the intention of converting it into a café and visitors&#x27; centre. However, this was repeatedly delayed by political and construction problems, until it was eventually opened to the public in September 2018.

The Control Tower features three floors, with the café on the ground floor and a visitors&#x27; centre on the first floor, housing a permanent exhibition on Greenham Common&#x27;s Cold War history and a temporary exhibition space. The top floor observation area offers panoramic views across the Common.

Since its opening in 2018, the Control Tower has hosted numerous exhibitions on the history of the Common and surrounding area. This included &quot;Both Sides of the Fence&quot; in 2021, marking 40 years since the arrival of the Greenham Peace Women at the air base.

==In popular culture==

The airfield was used In the sixth series of &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; where the production team built a petrol garage and diner to be used in a large incident in episode 7.

An episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; was filmed at the abandoned airfield, with Jeremy Clarkson and James May attempting to find out if communism had produced a good car.

Beyoncé used the airfield to film scenes for her 2013 self-titled visual album.

Greenham Common airfield was used as a filming location for the 2015 film &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; and 2017 film &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;. The GAMA &quot;(GLCM Alert and Maintenance Area)&quot; area was used as the location for the above ground Resistance base on the fictional planet D&#x27;Qar.

Greenham Common airfield was also used as a filming location for the 2019 film &quot;Fast and Furious 9&quot;.

Additionally, Greenham Common airfield was used as a filming location for the 2023 film &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;.

<text>A seal is a device or material that helps join systems, mechanisms or other materials together by preventing leakage (e.g. in a system), containing pressure, or excluding contamination. The effectiveness of a seal is dependent on adhesion in the case of sealants and compression in the case of gaskets. The seals are installed in pumps in a wide range of industries including chemicals, water supply, paper production, food processing and many other applications.

A stationary seal may also be referred to as a &#x27;packing&#x27;.

Seal types:
*Induction sealing or cap sealing
*Adhesive, sealant
*Bodok seal, a specialized gas sealing washer for medical applications
*Bonded seal, also known as Dowty seal or Dowty washer. A type of washer with integral gasket, widely used to provide a seal at the entry point of a screw or bolt 
*Bridgman seal, a piston sealing mechanism that creates a high pressure reservoir from a lower pressure source
*Split seals are innovative sealing solutions designed to enhance efficiency and convenience in various mechanical systems. These seals are specifically engineered to address the challenges associated with traditional seals, offering improved installation, maintenance, and operational benefits.
*Bung
*Compression seal fitting
*Diaphragm seal
*Ferrofluidic seal
*Gasket or Mechanical packing
**Flange gasket
**O-ring
**O-ring boss seal
**Piston ring
*Glass-to-metal seal
*Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals
*Heat seal
*Hose coupling, various types of hose couplings
*Hermetic seal
*Hydrostatic seal
*Hydrodynamic seal
*Inflatable seal Seals that inflate and deflate in three basic directions of operation: the axial direction, the radial-in direction, and the radial-out direction. Each of these inflation directions has their own set of performance parameters for measurements such as the height of inflation and the center-line bend radius that the seal can negotiate. Inflatable seals can be used for numerous applications with difficult sealing issues. 
*Labyrinth seal A seal which creates a tortuous path for the liquid to flow through
*Lid (container)
*Rotating face mechanical seal
*Face seal
*Plug
*Radial shaft seal
*Trap (plumbing) (siphon trap)
*Stuffing box (mechanical packing)
*Wiper seal
*Dry gas seal

<doc id="845215" wikidata="Q7312505" url="?curid=845215" title="Renal threshold">
<text>In physiology, the renal threshold is the concentration of a substance dissolved in the blood above which the kidneys begin to remove it into the urine. When the renal threshold of a substance is exceeded, reabsorption of the substance by the proximal convoluted tubule is incomplete; consequently, part of the substance remains in the urine. Renal thresholds vary by substance – the low potency poison urea, for instance, is removed at much lower concentrations than glucose. Indeed, the most common reason for the glucose renal threshold ever being exceeded is diabetes, which is called glycosuria. 

Renal thresholds vary by species and by physiological condition; thus an animal may have different renal thresholds while hibernating. Renal thresholds can also be altered by many drugs, and may change in characteristic ways during certain illnesses. If the renal threshold itself is reduced, can also produce detectable glucose in the urine. This is called renal glycosuria.

Taken together, the collection of a kidney&#x27;s renal thresholds essentially define much of its function in renal physiology. Many tests of kidney function amount to measures of renal thresholds for various substances.

<doc id="845222" wikidata="Q2624722" url="?curid=845222" title="Doctor Mid-Nite">
<text>Doctor Mid-Nite (or Doctor Midnight) is the name of multiple superheroes published in American comic books by DC Comics. The original version of the character was first created by writer Charles Reizenstein and artist Stanley Josephs Aschmeier in 194, debuting in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #25 (April 1941). All versions of the character are depicted as blinded superheroes capable of seeing in darkness and serve as physicians of normal and metahuman superheroes of the DC Universe. As a blind character, Doctor Mid-Nite is widely regarded as the first superhero in comics to exhibit a physical impairment, pre-dating the creation of Daredevil of Marvel Comics by more than twenty years.

The first version of the character was Charles McNider, a surgeon who was blinded but discovered abilities that allowed him to see solely in the dark. Donning special goggles and becoming a crime fighter, he became the first Doctor Mid-Nite and is an important member of the All-Star Squadron and Justice Society of America. The second version was Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Chapel, McNider&#x27;s African-American protege aware of his heroic dual identity and who is similarly injured during an explosion from an oxygen tank while helping a patient although her vision is partially restored. Also able to see better in dark conditions, Beth eventually adopts her mentor&#x27;s codename and legacy, acting as official physician of the JSA&#x27;s adjacent team, Infinity Inc. She later becomes a member of the Justice Society of America. The third version of the character is Pieter Cross, Norwegian medical prodigy who was delivered as an infant by McNider and is his second protege. Blinded after a car accident while drugged with a variation of the venom drug, he is also able to see at night and becomes the next Doctor Mid-Nite, serving as the Justice Society&#x27;s de-facto medic and mentoring heroes such as Jaime Reyes. In recent publications, both Cross and Chapel concurrently serve as Doctor Mid-Nite.

Doctor Mid-Nite has made several appearance in media adaptions, most notably the Charles McNider version making his live action debut in the second season of &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; played by Kwesi Ameyaw. McNider also appears in &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Henry Thomas in season one and Alex Collins in season two. Beth Chapel also appears in the series, portrayed by actress Anjelika Washington.

== Publication history ==
The original version of the character first debuted in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #25 (April 1941), created by Charles Reizenstein and Stanley Aschmeier.

==Character overview==
While there been three different Doctor Mid-Nites, all versions share the uncanny trait of possessing abilities that allows them to see in total darkness and serve as premier medical specialists for superheroes within the DC Universe. While Beth Chapel is the second person to serve as Doctor Mid-Nite both within the stories and publications, some sources also claim Pieter Cross to be the second Doctor-Midnite.

=== Characterization ===

==== Charles McNider ====

Dr. Charles McNider is the original Doctor Mid-Nite and is a common member of the Justice Society of America. As a young surgeon, McNider was blinded when a grenade went off in front of him caused by gangster &quot;Killer&quot; Maroni, but he found that he could see in the dark. He made special goggles that allowed him to see in the daylight, and decided to use his special power to fight crime. In his civilian identity, he became an author of an opinion column. Overtime, throughout his life, he eventually becomes the mentor to both successors Beth and Pieter at different times while an advisory member of the Justice Society. McNider is eventually killed during the Zero Hour crossover by Extant.

==== Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Chapel ====

Dr. Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Chapel is the first protege of McNider and African-American born and raised in Orangeburg, South Carolina. Held in high esteem by her mentor, she is aware of his dual life even before revealing it to her himself and first encounters the JSA treating hero, Jade. Chapel is blinded following an explosion from an oxygen tank while treating a patient during the Crisis on Infinite Earths but has night vision powers like McNider. She eventually succeeds her mentor, acting as the official team member of Infinity, Inc. with a focus on her medical career. Subjected to comic book death, she is eventually resurrected and continues as a member of the Justice Society.

==== Pieter Anton Cross ====

Dr. Pieter Anton Cross is a Norwegian prodigy and second protege of McNider who was delivered as an infant by him during McNider&#x27;s more active years as a hero. Moving to America, Cross becomes a physician himself and studied under his idol. Cross also becomes more involve in rooting out crime but is blinded while investigating a Venom-derived drug. Due to an unexpected side-effect, Cross could see in the ark and would become the third Doctor Mid-Nite. Like McNider and Chapel, he served as primarily a Justice Society member, physician for superheroes, and mentors Jaime Reyes.

=== Owl sidekicks ===
Both Charles McNider and Pieter Anton Cross train owls as sidekicks; McNider trains the same owl which crashes through his window, an event that leads to the discovery of his powers. This owl named &quot;Hooty&quot; (sometimes &quot;Hootie&quot;) shares many adventures during the Golden Age. Cross keeps company with an owl named &quot;Charlie&quot;. The bird is named after the original Doctor Mid-Nite Charles McNider. Charlie keeps a mini-camera around his neck that can feed video directly to a display in Cross&#x27;s goggles.

==Other versions==

* In 1965, DC Comics had no plans to revive Doctor Mid-Nite. DC editor Julius Schwartz gave M.I.T. student and comic book letterhack Rick Norwood permission to publish a Dr. Midnite story in his fanzine, &quot;Five&quot;. The story written by Norwood and illustrated by Steve Sabo features a doctor named Tom Benson who is blinded in battle. He discovers that his other senses are super-sensitive and dons the Doctor Midnite costume to fight crime.
* Another version of the character was shown in Dan Jolley and Tony Harris&#x27; &quot;&quot; as a World War II United States intelligence agent code-named the Owl. This character, though a playboy, resembles other Doctor Mid-Nite representations. Though derided for his dalliances with the ladies, McNider was trusted as a valued field operative.
* &quot;&quot; depicts an America ruled by a religious theocracy as a result of Oliver Cromwell living for a decade longer than he did in reality. McNider was a member of the underground resistance against the government years ago, working alongside Thomas Wayne, but they were discovered, with Thomas and his wife being killed while McNider was blinded and his own wife executed. McNider offers some advice to Thomas&#x27;s son Bruce when he discovers the truth about his parents&#x27; deaths, leading Bruce on the path to begin his own resistance against the government.
* In the &quot;Tangent: Superman&#x27;s Reign&quot; series, a version of Doctor Mid-Nite his body completely covered by a black cloak is briefly seen.
* In the new Earth-2 created in the wake of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and 52, a version of Beth Chapel is shown to be a member of the Justice Society Infinity.

<text>Peter John Preston (23 May 1938 – 6 January 2018) was a British journalist and author. He was editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; for twenty years, from 1975 to 1995.

==Early life==
Peter Preston was born in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, the son of John Preston, a greengrocery business manager, and his wife, Kathlyn Preston (née Chell). He grew up in the village of Quorn, two miles south of Loughborough.

His father died from polio when Preston was a child, and he subsequently caught the disease; he spent 18 months in and out of hospital, including time in an iron lung. The disease caused permanent damage to his body. He was educated at Loughborough Grammar School and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he edited the student paper &quot;Cherwell&quot;.

==Career==
Preston started his career at the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; in 1959, and joined &quot;The Guardian&quot; (then the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;) in 1963. He rose to become editor in 1975 and remained so for more than twenty years, retiring in 1995. He reported on Conservative MPs, including the perjurious Jonathan Aitken and the cash-for-questions affair involving Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith. In both instances, a source was Harrod&#x27;s and Paris Ritz owner Mohammed Al-Fayed. Preston was also editor when &quot;The Guardian&quot; was forced to hand over leaked government documents, which were then traced to a Foreign Office copier, leading to Sarah Tisdall, who was subsequently imprisoned under the Official Secrets Act 1911.

He continued as a columnist for the rest of his life. He contributed a weekly column to &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Peter Preston on press and broadcasting&quot;, devoted mainly to news about newspapers, their readers and (generally) diminishing circulations in the newspaper&#x27;s &quot;business and media&quot; section. He was one of the founders of the European Press Prize and acted as chairman of its preparatory committee from 2013 until 2017. He had strong opinions on Brexit and the balance of the BBC and continued to take to social media to discuss this after his retirement. He was a member of the Scott Trust (owner of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot;) from 1979 to 2003, chairman of the International Press Institute from 1995 to 1997, and chairman of the Association of British Press Editors. Preston wrote two novels, &quot;Bess&quot; (1999) and &quot;51st State&quot; (1998).

==Personal life and honours==
In 1962, Preston married Jean Burrell, and they had four children. His son, Ben Preston, is a former deputy editor of &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Radio Times&quot;, and is executive editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

Preston received honorary degrees from the City University, London, and the universities of Leicester, Loughborough, Essex and Roehampton.

Preston died on 6 January 2018 after suffering from melanoma.

<text>Herbert Kaufman (March 6, 1878 – September 6, 1947) was an American writer and newspaperman whose editorials were widely syndicated in both the United States and Canada. During World War I, Kaufman regularly contributed articles and editorials to the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and other leading British periodicals, along with more than 50 war poems, including the classic &quot;The Hell-Gate of Soissons&quot;.

==Biography==
Herbert Kaufman was born in Washington, D.C., on March 6, 1878.

He died at his home in Tarrytown, New York, on September 6, 1947.

==Works==
Kaufman is the author of several books, including:
* &quot;The Stolen Throne&quot; (c. 1907; co-authored with May Isabel Fisk and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy and Herman Rountree)
* &quot;The Winning Fight&quot; (c. 1910) being perhaps his most popular work
* &quot;Do Something! Be Something!&quot; (c. 1912)
* &quot;The Efficient Age&quot; (c. 1913)
* &quot;The Song of Guns&quot; (1914, reissued in 1915 as &quot;The Hell-Gate of Soissons And Other Poems&quot;)
* &quot;The Clock that Had No Hands&quot; (c. 1912; a compilation of essays on the value of advertising)
* &quot;Neighbors&quot; (c. 1914)

Kaufman is known for his essays on success, war poetry, and &quot;Kaufmanisms.&quot; A &quot;Kaufmanism&quot; is the persuasive rhetorical juxtaposition of words that reverses the subject and object of a phrase often meant to change its context and meaning, typically used to add additional emphasis to both nouns.

Select Kaufmanisms:

* &quot;A coward can&#x27;t conquer anything, because he can&#x27;t conquer himself.&quot;
* &quot;The man who won&#x27;t go through to the finish has finished at the start.&quot;
* &quot;They who fight in the dark do not shine in the light.&quot;
* &quot;Mind your own business and in time you&#x27;ll have a business of your own to mind.&quot;

<doc id="845233" wikidata="Q2627537" url="?curid=845233" title="Sheba son of Bichri">
<text>In the Old Testament, Sheba was a Benjaminite leader who revolted against King David, recounted in 2 Samuel.

==In the Bible==

Sheba was a son of Bichri, of the family of Becher, the son of Benjamin, and thus of the tribe of King Saul.

When David returned to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom, strife arose between the ten tribes and the Tribe of Judah, because the latter took the lead in bringing back the king. Sheba took advantage of this state of things, and raised the standard of revolt, proclaiming, &quot;We have no part in David.&quot; With his followers he proceeded northward. David seeing it necessary to check this revolt, ordered Amasa to summon the army. When Amasa delayed his task, David appointed Abishai and Joab to take the &quot;gibborim&quot; (&quot;mighty men&quot;) and the body-guard and such troops as he could gather, and pursue Sheba. Joab took the opportunity to kill Amasa. Then Joab and Abishai arrived at the city of Abel-beth-maachah, where they knew Sheba to be hiding. They besieged the city. An unnamed wise woman from the city convinced Joab not to destroy Abel Beth-Maacah, because the people did not want Sheba hiding there. She told the people of the city to kill Sheba, and his head was thrown over the wall to Joab.

==In the Talmud==

In Tosefta Terumot 7:19, the rabbis debate whether it was proper under Jewish law to give up Sheba in order to save the city from Joab&#x27;s army. Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai said giving up Sheba is forbidden. Rabbi Judah bar Ilai said the wise woman acted properly because Joab had the city surrounded. Everyone in the city would be killed including Sheba so it was better to give up Sheba and save everyone else.

This story served as the source for the subsequent halachic discussion whether it is permissible for a group or community to save itself by sacrificing an individual. The Tosefta establishes the principle that we may not save a community by sacrificing an individual, unless the original demand was for a specified individual. R. Shimon b. Lakish adds the condition that the specified individual be deserving of death because of a crime he committed. This view has been codified by Maimonides in his code of Jewish Law.

Sanhedrin 101b identified Sheba with two other men:

&quot;A Tanna taught: Nebat, Micah, and Sheba the son of Bichri are one and the same.&quot; The three interpreted signs and portents to mean that they would reign. &quot;Three beheld but did not see.&quot;

<doc id="845239" wikidata="Q5533417" url="?curid=845239" title="Genoa, Houston">
<text>Genoa is an area in Houston, Texas, United States located about southeast of Downtown Houston; it was formerly a distinct unincorporated area in Harris County.

==History==
J. H. Burnett established Genoa in 1892; he gave the community the name &quot;Genoa&quot; because he believed that the climate was similar to the climate of Genoa, Italy. The post office opened during that year. The founder built a railroad depot serving the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad, five houses, one hotel, and one store.

The community was located along a main street that is now known as Almeda Genoa Road (the road from Almeda to Genoa). The east end of the community was the Old Galveston Road (Texas State Highway 3) and the Galveston, Houston, Henderson Railroad. The western edge was Freestone Street and the railway just to the west. Where the main street continued east from Old Galveston Road became known as Genoa Red Bluff (the road from Genoa to Red Bluff). The community also has another road on the east end of the community that is Allen Genoa Road (the road from Allen to Genoa)

The &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; stated that Genoa &quot;grew slowly.&quot; In 1914 the community had 200 people and several businesses, including a general store, a dairy, a nursery, a blacksmith shop, and a carpenter. By 1925 the community had 100 people; the population remained at this level until around 1941. During that year Genoa had 400 people and fifteen businesses. The population remained at that level until Houston annexed Genoa in the mid-1960s.

==Government and infrastructure==

===Local government===
Houston City Council District E serves Genoa. As of 2008 Mike Sullivan represents the district.

===County, state, and federal representation===
Genoa is located within Harris County Precinct 2; as of 2008 Sylvia Garcia heads Precinct 2.

Genoa is located in District 144 of the Texas House of Representatives. As of 2008, Robert E. Tarlton represents the district. Genoa is within District 11 of the Texas Senate; as of 2008 Mike Jackson represents that district.

Genoa is in Texas&#x27;s 22nd congressional district.

The United States Postal Service operates the Genoa Post Office at 10935 Almeda Genoa Road.

==Education==

Children in the Genoa neighborhood attend school in the Pasadena Independent School District. The area is zoned to Genoa Elementary School in Houston, Lomax Middle School in Pasadena, Elmer Bondy Intermediate School in Pasadena, and Pasadena Memorial High School in Pasadena.

Despite being located in Houston, it is &quot;not&quot; served by the Houston Independent School District.

Residents of Pasadena ISD (and therefore Genoa) are zoned to San Jacinto College.

By 1905 a school with one teacher and thirty students appeared.

==Notable residents==
* Saburo Arai, a Houston-area Japanese American entrepreneur who led the Japanese Association and exempted Japanese already living in Texas from a law which banned ethnic Japanese from owning land

<doc id="845253" wikidata="Q796557" url="?curid=845253" title="Gonostomatidae">
<text>The Gonostomatidae are a family of mesopelagic marine fish, commonly named bristlemouths, lightfishes, or anglemouths. It is a relatively small family, containing only eight known genera and 32 species. However, bristlemouths make up for their lack of diversity with relative abundance, numbering in the hundreds of trillions to quadrillions. The genus &quot;Cyclothone&quot; (with 13 species) is thought to be one of the most abundant vertebrate genera in the world.

The fossil record of this family dates back to the Miocene epoch. Living bristlemouths were discovered by William Beebe in the early 1930s and described by L. S. Berg in 1958. The fish are mostly found in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, although the species &quot;Cyclothone microdon&quot; may be found in Arctic waters. They have elongated bodies from in length. They have a number of green or red light-producing photophores aligned along the undersides of their heads or bodies. Their chief common name, bristlemouth, comes from their odd, equally sized, and bristle-like teeth. They are typically black in color which provides camouflage from predators in deep, dark waters. They mainly feed on zooplankton and small crustaceans due to their small size.

== Morphology ==
Bristlemouths are protandrous, therefore a male first hermaphrodite. They begin their lives as males and some of them switch to female. Male bristlemouths are smaller than females.

Bristlemouths have large jaws that are capable of catching prey larger than themselves. The length of the S. glarisianus&#x27;s (a species of Bristlemouth) lower jaw is equaled to 70% of the entire length of their head. The lower jaw of the Bristlemouths is not functional in terms of masticating their prey. It is therefore hypothesized that they swallow their prey tail first.

Bristlemouths are extremely small, measuring on average . Bristlemouths have elongated bodies, small eyes, short snouts, large mouths, and large jaws. The position of the dorsal fin begins in line with the anal fin. The difference between bristlemouths species is found in the intensity of their pigmentation and photophore size. For the majority of the species, the morphology remains the same.

Bristlemouths are mostly dark in pigmentation but at times can display translucently. Bristlemouths contain a pineal organ which functions to detect slow changing ambient light. This allows the Bristlemouth to have control over its circadian clock and seasonal behavior.

Due to the small size of the fish, they are easy prey to dragonfish and fangtooths.

==Taxonomy==
Some classifications include the genera &quot;Pollichthys&quot; and &quot;Vinciguerria&quot;, but this article follows FishBase in placing them in the family Phosichthyidae.

Some classifications include species in the genus &quot;Zaphotias&quot;, but these are junior synonyms of the species &quot;Bonapartia pedaliota&quot;.

== Feeding habits ==

Brislemouths feed mostly on zooplankton and small crustaceans. Their diet is composed of a range from 92 to 98% of Crustacea. A minor part of their diet is made up of opportunistic encounters with smaller fish. Brislemouths that consume fish prey are found in individuals ranging from 70 mm to 75 mm. Bristlemouths do not have seasonal trends when it comes to their feeding habits.

Bristlemouths are diel vertical migrators, therefore migrating closer to the surface waters in the nighttime in order to find more food. Out of the thirteen bristlemouth species, eight have been found near the surface therefore explaining their DVM behaviors.

Bristlemouths are able to efficiently capture their prey due to their bioluminescent nature.

== Bioluminescence ==
Bristlemouths are light emitting fish. Bristlemouths rely on their bioluminescence for different outcomes. Some rely on it to find prey while others use it to avoid predation. However, the most common way that their bioluminescence is used is to signal between fish in the same way people &quot;dance or wear bright colors at the nightclub.&quot;

<text>Liza Frulla (born March 30, 1949, in Montreal, Quebec), formerly known as Liza Frulla-Hébert, is a former Canadian politician. She was a Liberal Member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1989 to 1998, a Liberal Member of Parliament from 2002 to 2006, and a member of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Paul Martin.

== Background ==
All four of Frulla&#x27;s grandparents were born in Italy and like many Italian Quebeckers, her family was strongly federalist and Quebec Liberal oriented. In college she says she was not politically involved as she voted &quot;yes&quot; in the 1980 referendum, believing it was only fair to give René Lévesque&#x27;s government a mandate to negotiate, but when the results were strongly &quot;no&quot;, she reverted to federalism. She then later worked as a marketer for Labatt Breweries when she regularly met with government officials and eventually joined the Quebec Liberals under Robert Bourassa.

==Early career==

From 1974 to 1976, Frulla worked for the public affairs service of the organizing committee for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. She subsequently became the first woman reporter accredited to cover professional sport in the electronic media.

==Provincial politics==
From 1989 to 1998, she represented the riding of Marguerite-Bourgeoys in the National Assembly of Quebec. She was Minister of Communications and Minister of Cultural Affairs. She was vice-chair of the &quot;No&quot; committee in the 1995 Quebec referendum. However, on November 1, 2007, while appearing on the RDI program &quot;Le Club des Ex&quot;, she admitted to having voted for the &quot;Yes&quot; side in the 1980 referendum.

In 1998, she left the National Assembly to host her own show, &quot;Liza&quot;, on public broadcaster Radio-Canada until 2002.

==Federal politics==

She was elected to Parliament in a 2002 by-election in the now-defunct riding of Verdun—Saint-Henri—Saint-Paul—Pointe-Saint-Charles. After that riding was merged with portions of neighbouring ridings to form Jeanne-Le Ber, she was re-elected by a razor-thin margin over Thierry St-Cyr in 2004; she subsequently lost to him in 2006.

Frulla has the prenominal &quot;the Honourable&quot; and the postnominal &quot;PC&quot; for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on December 12, 2003. She was the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Minister responsible for the Status of Women in the cabinet of Prime Minister Paul Martin and previously served as Minister of Social Development.

==Honours==
In 2016, she was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. In 2017, she was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="845266" wikidata="Q3061289" url="?curid=845266" title="Eva Tanguay">
<text>Eva Tanguay (August 1, 1878 – January 11, 1947) was a Canadian singer and entertainer who billed herself as &quot;the girl who made vaudeville famous&quot;. She was known as &quot;The Queen of Vaudeville&quot; during the height of her popularity from the early 1900s until the early 1920s. Tanguay also appeared in films, and was the first performer to achieve national mass-media celebrity, with publicists and newspapers covering her tours from coast-to-coast, out-earning the likes of contemporaries Enrico Caruso and Harry Houdini at one time, and being described by Edward Bernays, &quot;the father of public relations&quot;, as &quot;our first symbol of emergence from the Victorian age.&quot;

==Early life==

Tanguay was born in 1878 in Marbleton, Quebec. Her father was a doctor. Before she reached the age of six, her family moved from Quebec&#x27;s Eastern Townships to Holyoke, Massachusetts. Her father died soon after. While still a child she developed an interest in the performing arts, making her first appearance on stage at the age of eight, circa 1886, at an amateur night in Holyoke. In her earliest days she was promoted through a small theater company operated by one Paul C. Winkelmann, a successful 16-year-old multi-instrumentalist who lived next door to her family and who used his influence to give a testimonial benefit show for her at the Holyoke Opera House, a venue which she would return to years later after establishing her own act.
Two years later, she was touring professionally with a production of a stage adaptation of the popular Frances Hodgson Burnett novel &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;. Tanguay eventually landed a spot in the Broadway musical &quot;My Lady&quot; in 1901. The 1904 show &quot;The Chaperons&quot; started her rise in popularity. In 1904 and 1905, her career reached new heights as she starred in &quot;The Sambo Girl&quot;, which debuted the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care,&quot; composed specifically for her. 

&quot;The Sambo Girl&quot; also starred Melville Collins as Raphael Rubens, Tanguay&#x27;s romantic interest in the show. This began a longterm professional partnership between Tanguay and Collins, with Collins serving as her accompanist in vaudeville for more than a decade and also her sometimes manager. He was reportedly the major love of Tanguay&#x27;s life, although he never returned her feelings and ultimately married Tanguay&#x27;s niece, Lillian M Skelding, in 1914. While Collins died in 1924, years later an urn containing his ashes was placed in Tanguay&#x27;s casket and they were buried together in 1947.

==Stage career==
Although she possessed only an average voice, the enthusiasm with which Tanguay performed her suggestive songs soon made her an audience favorite. She went on to have a long-lasting vaudeville career and eventually commanded one of the highest salaries of any performer of the day, earning as much as $3,500 a week ($ in dollars) at the height of her fame around 1910.

After seeing her perform, English poet and sexual revolutionary Aleister Crowley called Tanguay America&#x27;s equivalent to Europe&#x27;s music hall greats Marie Lloyd of England and Yvette Guilbert of France. &quot;The American Genius&quot;, he wrote, &quot;is unlike all others. The &#x27;cultured&#x27; artist, in this country, is always a mediocrity ... The true American is, above all things, FREE; with all the advantages and disadvantages that that implies. His genius is a soul lonely, disolate, reaching to perfection in some unguessed direction ... Eva Tanguay is the perfect American artist. She is ... starry chaste in her colossal corruption.&quot;

Tanguay is remembered for brassy, self-confident songs that symbolized the emancipated woman, such as &quot;It&#x27;s All Been Done Before but Not the Way I Do It&quot;, &quot;I Want Someone to Go Wild with Me&quot;, &quot;Go as Far as You Like&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s Why They Call Me Tabasco&quot;. In showbiz circles, she was nicknamed the &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Girl&quot; after her most famous song, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;. She was brought in to star in the 1909 &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, where she replaced the husband-and-wife team of Jack Norworth and Nora Bayes, who were engaged in a bitter salary and personal feud with Ziegfeld. Tanguay requested that the musical number &quot;Moving Day in Jungle Town&quot; be taken from rising talent Sophie Tucker and given to her. Despite this, the two later became close friends.

Tanguay spent lavishly on publicity campaigns and costumes. One obituary notes that a &quot;clever manager&quot; told Tanguay early in her career that money made money. She never forgot the lesson, buying huge ads at her own expense and on one occasion allegedly spending twice her salary on publicity.

Gaining free publicity with outrageous behavior was one of her strengths. In 1907, she stayed with married entertainment journalist and publicist C. F. Zittel in a Brooklyn hotel for nearly a week. Zittel&#x27;s wife uncovered the affair by hiring detectives dressed as room-service bellhops to burst into the room. The event made headlines and did not damage Eva&#x27;s popularity, reputation, or box-office success. She also got her name in the papers for allegedly being kidnapped, allegedly having her jewels stolen, and being fined $50 in Louisville, Kentucky, for throwing a stagehand down a flight of stairs.

===Stage costume===
Her costumes were as extravagant as her personality. In 1910, a year after the Lincoln penny was first issued, Tanguay appeared on stage in a coat entirely covered in the new coins.

===Recording===
Tanguay only made one known recording (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;) in 1922 for Nordskog Records. In addition to her singing career, she starred in two film comedies, which used the screen to capture her lusty stage vitality. The first, titled &quot;Energetic Eva&quot;, was made in 1916. The following year, she starred with Tom Moore in &quot;The Wild Girl&quot;.

===Retirement===
Tanguay was said to have lost more than $2 million ($ in dollars) in the Wall Street crash of 1929. In the 1930s, she retired from show business. Cataracts caused her to lose her sight, but Sophie Tucker, a friend from vaudeville days, paid for an operation that helped to restore some of her vision.

==Autobiography==
At the time of her death, Tanguay was working on her autobiography, to be titled &quot;Up and Down the Ladder&quot;. Three excerpts from the autobiography were published in Hearst newspapers in 1946 and 1947.

==Death==
Tanguay died on January 11, 1947, aged 68, in Hollywood. She was interred in the Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery, now Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 1953, Mitzi Gaynor portrayed Eva Tanguay in a fictionalized version of her life in &quot;The I Don&#x27;t Care Girl&quot;.

==Family==
Tanguay married twice, although she was incorrectly reported to have been married up to four times, due in part to her 1908 public engagement to extremely popular cross-dressing performer Julian Eltinge, who played the bride while she dressed in traditional male formal attire. They exchanged rings but never legally wed.

Her first marriage was to dancer John Ford in 1913, but they divorced after four years. Following her divorce, Tanguay was romantically linked, though never married, as was sometimes reported, to vaudeville dancer Roscoe Ails. She terminated the relationship after Ails&#x27;s behavior became increasingly erratic and violent.

In 1927, aged 49, Tanguay married her piano accompanist, 25-year-old Al Parado. Shortly after the marriage, she had it annulled on the grounds of fraud. She claimed that Parado had at least two other names, which he used so frequently that she was not sure which one was real. The marriage was actually a publicity ploy and was dissolved by Tanguay when it did not bear the intended promotional results.

<doc id="845268" wikidata="Q551533" url="?curid=845268" title="Jean Langlais">
<text>Jean François-Hyacinthe Langlais III (15 February 1907 – 8 May 1991) was a French composer of modern classical music, organist, and improviser. He described himself as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Breton, of Catholic faith&quot;).

==Biography== 
Langlais was born in La Fontenelle (Ille-et-Vilaine, Brittany), a small village near Mont Saint-Michel, France to Jean-Marie-Joseph Langlais II, a blacksmith and Flavie Canto, a seamstress. Langlais became blind due to glaucoma when he was only two years old and was sent to the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles (National Institute for Blind Children) in Paris, where he began to study the organ, with André Marchal. From there he progressed to the Paris Conservatoire, obtaining prizes in organ and studying composition with Marcel Dupré and Paul Dukas. He also studied improvisation with Charles Tournemire.

After graduating, Langlais returned to the National Institute for Blind Children to teach, and also taught at the Schola Cantorum in Paris from 1961 to 1976. Many of his students went on to become important musicians, including organists and composers; among them was the American Kathleen Thomerson, who later published a bio-bibliography about him. Another one was Margreeth Chr. de Jong, a Dutch organist, composer and music educator.

His first wife Jeannette asked his former student, personal recital liaison and friend Ann Labounsky in 1972 to write Langlais&#x27; biography &quot;Jean Langlais the Man and His Music&quot;, though it was not published until 2000; nine years after Langlais&#x27; death. Labounsky did her doctoral paper in 1991 on the life and works of Langlais and fortunately she was able to share some of it with Langlais before he died. However Langlais was displeased as Labounsky was truthful in what she saw as Langlais wanted to be painted as the way he saw his truth. Labounsky admitted that at times Langlais could be a complex person but Langlais did not see himself this way. This was partly due to the region of Brittany in which he grew up as the Bretons considered themselves to be a proud people who loved to tell folklore.

It was as an organist that Langlais made his name, following in the footsteps of César Franck and Charles Tournemire as &quot;organiste titulaire&quot; at the Basilica of Sainte-Clotilde in Paris in 1945, a post in which he remained until 1988. He was much in demand as a concert organist, and widely toured across Europe and the United States. His 3rd North American tour lasted from January through March 1956, and saw him play on both coasts.

Langlais died in the 15th arrondissement of Paris at the age of 84, and was survived by his second wife Marie-Louise Jaquet-Langlais and three children, Janine, Claude and Caroline. The position of organist at Sainte-Clotilde was succeeded to by Jacques Taddei.

==Music==
Langlais was a prolific composer, composing 254 works with opus numbers, the first of which was his &quot;Prelude and Fugue&quot; for organ (1927), and the last his &quot;Trio&quot; (1990), another organ piece. Although best known as a composer of organ music and sacred choral music, he also composed a number of instrumental, orchestral and chamber works and some secular song settings.

Langlais&#x27; music is written in a highly individual eclectic style, venturing well beyond what might be expected of mid-twentieth-century French music, with rich and complex harmonies and overlapping modes, sometimes more tonal than his contemporary, friend and countryman Olivier Messiaen, sometimes related to his two predecessors at Sainte-Clotilde, Franck and Tournemire, but sometimes also employing serial techniques and often exhibiting an earthy, Celtic folkiness which owes not a little to Bartók: &quot;&quot; as one early reviewer wrote.

Owing to his blindness, Langlais&#x27;s method of composition involved him thinking about the work in every detail over a long period, and only then writing it down in shorthand Braille. He would then dictate each note and its rhythmic value to an amanuensis (often his first wife Jeannette) to produce the full score.

His best-known works include his four-part masses, &quot;Messe solennelle&quot; and &quot;Missa Salve Regina&quot;, his &quot;Missa in simplicitate&quot; for unison voice and organ, and his many organ compositions, including:
*&quot;Hymne d&#x27;actions de grâces&quot; from &quot;Three Gregorian Paraphrases&quot;
*&quot;La nativité&quot; and &quot;Les rameaux&quot; (The Palms) (Poèmes Evangeliques)
*&quot;Chant héroïque&quot;, &quot;Chant de paix&quot;, and &quot;De profundis&quot; from &quot;Nine Pieces&quot;
*&quot;Kyrie &quot;Orbis factor&quot; &quot; from &quot;Livre œcuménique&quot;
*&quot;Incantation pour un jour saint&quot; (Incantation for Easter)
*&quot;Cantilène (Suite brève)&quot;
*&quot;Suite médiévale&quot;
*&quot;Folkloric Suite&quot;
*&quot;Trois méditations sur la Sainte Trinité&quot;
*&quot;Fête&quot;, Op. 51
*&quot;24 Pieces for harmonium or organ&quot;, Op. 6

<doc id="845293" wikidata="Q2560970" url="?curid=845293" title="Beavis">
<text>Beavis is a fictional character who serves as one of two protagonists from the MTV/Paramount+ animated series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. He is voiced by the show&#x27;s creator, Mike Judge. In the movie &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe&quot;, Beavis&#x27; mother is referred to as &quot;Shirley Beavis&quot;, implying that Beavis is actually the character&#x27;s last name. His father is a former Mötley Crüe roadie.

Beavis has blond hair which he wears in an oversized pompadour style, a pronounced underbite, and an obsessive stare. He speaks in a hoarse voice frequently punctuated by his trademark snicker (&quot;Heh heh&quot;). He is nearly always seen in profile, rather than looking directly at the camera. He is usually seen wearing a Metallica T-shirt, though in merchandising appearances his shirt displays the slogan &quot;Death Rock&quot; to avoid licensing issues. In the episode &quot;Give Blood&quot;, he wears a Slayer shirt, while in the Christmas special &quot;It&#x27;s a Miserable Life&quot; Beavis is seen wearing a Winger shirt during the alternate reality section of the episode. In the 2022 revival, Beavis&#x27; older self wears glasses, a dark gray T-shirt and jeans.

He is slightly shorter than his best friend, Butt-Head, although he appears taller from a distance due to his hairstyle. Beavis works with Butt-Head as a fry cook at the (fictional) fast-food restaurant Burger World and once defiantly revealed that he is a fan of the rock band Bon Jovi to Butt-Head, who dislikes the band and its lead singer, Jon Bon Jovi.

Beavis in some episodes also transforms into a character called &quot;Cornholio&quot; who often shouts things like &quot;Bunghole&quot;. He becomes Cornholio when he consumes an excess amount of sugar or caffeine, or mind altering substances.
Beavis&#x27;s name was inspired by a friend of Judge&#x27;s from his college days named Bobby Beavis.

==Personality==
Dan Tobin of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; described Beavis as &quot;the sidekick and follower&quot; who developed into &quot;more of a loose cannon&quot;.

Mike Judge once said in an interview that Beavis &quot;is a zero&quot; when it comes to intelligence; indeed, Beavis is often oblivious to what should be obvious. Generally subordinate to Butt-Head and willing to tolerate a large amount of physical and verbal abuse, Beavis nonetheless has limits. In &quot;Murder Site&quot;, Beavis was driven to attack and nearly kill Butt-Head, who ceaselessly called him &quot;Butt-Knocker&quot;, a term which Beavis resents. Beavis also stood up to Butt-Head while they were watching the video for Rancid&#x27;s &quot;Nihilism&quot;: Butt-Head kept talking about it derisively, prompting Beavis to tell Butt-Head to shut up. When Butt-Head reacted with fury, ordering Beavis never again to tell him to shut up and threatening to attack him, Beavis preemptively kicked Butt-Head in the testicles, told him to shut up again, and walked out of the room to get something to eat. In another episode, while the duo were watching a Bon Jovi video, Beavis claimed to like one part of the song, causing Butt-Head to slap him in disgust. After being struck a few times, Beavis kicked Butt-Head in the groin and proclaimed: &quot;Bon Jovi rules!&quot;

In spite of his overt idiocy, Beavis possesses a number of character strengths. Though usually shown to be the (slightly) less intelligent of the two, he can be inadvertently witty, and when discussing subjects that neither he nor Butt-Head understands, he is more likely to guess the actual mechanisms at work. Also, on the rare occasion that a female exhibits interest in one of the duo, it is usually Beavis who gets the attention. Beavis has also shown instances of insight on such topics as the true meaning of Christmas, or in his analysis of a video by Korn. However, in both instances Beavis seems to be either in a trance or possessed, and shortly afterward he displays no recollection of what he just said.

===Recklessness===
Beavis has a more volatile, unpredictable nature. His hasty actions usually end in disaster, ranging from being deported to Mexico to severely injuring himself and occasional arrest for crimes such as trespassing. In some early episodes, Beavis displays signs of being a pyromaniac. Though his obsession with fire remained an obvious trait, as the seasons progressed and network censorship pressures increased, his fixation became more of a passing gag. In a deleted scene from the 1996 film, Beavis steals the Declaration of Independence to use as toilet paper.

===Cornholio===

Cornholio is an alter ego of Beavis. Though the Cornholio character was developed in the episode &quot;The Great Cornholio&quot;, Beavis first plays the entity as a passing gag in &quot;Generation in Crisis&quot;. Beavis sometimes undergoes a radical personality change, usually after consuming large amounts of sugar, caffeine or stimulants. In &quot;Holy Cornholio&quot;, the transformation occurs after Beavis takes many pain pills. He pulls his shirt collar over his head, raises his forearms in a right angle to his chest, and then begins to yell or scream erratically, producing a stream of gibberish and strange noises, with his eyes wide. Cornholio is a normally dormant persona (apparently, the name is derived from the word &quot;cornhole&quot;). Cornholio tends to wander aimlessly while reciting &quot;I am the Great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!&quot; in an odd faux-Spanish accent. Whenever someone asks him a question or challenges him in a threatening or negative manner, Cornholio will respond with &quot;Are you threatening me?!&quot; Sometimes Beavis will momentarily talk normally before resuming the persona of Cornholio. When he stops acting as the Cornholio persona, Beavis usually has no memory of what happened. In the guise of Cornholio, Beavis becomes a successful beat poet.

In &quot;Vaya Con Cornholio&quot;, he is deported to Mexico after wrongfully being subjected to immigration detention by an agent of the INS. During his detention the agent and his superior attempt to make sense of the gibberish, going so far as to look up the definition of &quot;bunghole&quot;. In that same episode, he claims to be from Lake Titicaca (because of the scatological sound of its name), but when asked where it is, he responds (incorrectly) with &quot;Nicaragua&quot;. &quot;Nicaragua&quot; may be one of the few things Beavis remembers from class lectures. Beavis&#x27; teacher, Mr. Van Driessen, refers to Nicaragua during a lecture on world economic systems in &quot;The Great Cornholio&quot;, after which Beavis repeats the word while pacing back and forth in the classroom. Cornholio resurfaces in &quot;Bungholio: Lord of the Harvest&quot;, in which he steals candy from everyone and Butt-Head tails him. He had stood up to Todd Ianuzzi, who demanded he move out of the road. Todd prepared to beat Beavis up in his Cornholio form with his friends. He later spares Beavis, deeming him too insane, in favor of beating up the saner Butt-Head.

===Relationship with Butt-Head===
Though the closest of confidants, Beavis and Butt-Head have a jaded, violent, and at times borderline sadistic relationship. Butt-Head often insults and physically abuses Beavis (usually by slapping him, sometimes accompanied by a request to &quot;Settle down, Beavis!&quot; if Butt-Head feels his friend is getting a bit too hyperactive, as he often does). On occasion, Beavis will fight back or stand up for himself (&quot;Madame Blavatsky&quot;, &quot;They&#x27;re Coming to Take Me Away, Huh Huh&quot;). His favorite means of retribution is kicking Butt-Head in the testicles. On at least one occasion, Beavis throws the first punch. In &quot;Canoe&quot;, he initiates a fight by smacking Butt-Head across the head with a paddle (although Butt-Head goaded him into doing it). Butt-Head usually knows when Beavis is approaching his breaking point and will back off (as seen when he calls Beavis &quot;Buttknocker&quot; or insults Metallica one too many times). Despite being a victim of Butt-Head&#x27;s abuse, Beavis may prefer it to other options. For instance, in &quot;Nice Butt-Head,&quot; in which Butt-Head takes pills to curb his aggression and is shown to be kind and considerate, Beavis quickly tries to find a way to turn him back into his normal self. In &quot;Choke&quot;, he specifically states that Butt-Head is &quot;not really my friend,&quot; and in &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe,&quot; Butt-Head says that Beavis is &quot;not really my friend, he just follows me around.&quot; Nevertheless, it can be inferred that the duo are still best friends (or at least that their relationship is the only significant one for either), considering their shared activities, residence, interests, and their lack of any other friends. The two usually complement each other when one undertakes any sort of endeavor, especially if it involves their lifelong goal to &quot;score with chicks&quot;.

Beavis is usually a follower, willingly taking Butt-Head&#x27;s instructions and cooperating in his endeavors. This appears to be a byproduct of Beavis&#x27; own general witlessness rather than any fear of Butt-Head&#x27;s abuseas demonstrated in the alternate reality of &quot;It’s a Miserable Life&quot;, in which Butt-Head had never been born and Beavis was instead the dim but productive friend of younger neighbor and schoolmate Stewart Stevenson.

===Relationship with other characters===
Like Butt-Head, Beavis shares scorn for Stewart and Mr. Van Driessen. Though he shares Butt-Head&#x27;s mutual hatred for Coach Buzzcut for the way he exploits their lack of intelligence, manliness and strength, Beavis has a little respect for him. He has shown some respect for Daria, as she is the only student who tolerates the duo and doesn&#x27;t lose her cool in response to their actions.

===Traits===
While Butt-Head&#x27;s main interest in life is &quot;chicks&quot;, Beavis seems to be more interested in toilet humor and displays of violence. Beavis has a penchant for making off-beat sound effects to suit the occasion. Whenever he sees something that is sexually arousing, he imitates a spring (onomatopoetically saying &quot;Boi-oi-oi-oi-oiiing!!!&quot;) indicating a quick erection. He sometimes makes a Bronx cheer by puckering his lips. He occasionally does impersonations, such as of Principal McVicker (&quot;Speech Therapy&quot;), motivational speaker Mr. Manners/Mr. Candy (&quot;Manners Suck/Candy Sale&quot;), and Woody Woodpecker (&quot;Top O&#x27; the Mountain”). A special ability of his is speaking backwards, as seen in &quot;Vidiots&quot;, while the duo review a music video; however, he forgets how to do so by the end of the video. Beavis also displays a predilection for defecating and things that are related to it, and in a high-pitched tone will often enthusiastically utter the word &quot;poop&quot;, or will say the word &quot;plop&quot; to indicate a bowel movement. He frequently pulls down his pants during music video reviews. He also took Kaopectate once after hearing it is for diarrhea under the misconception he would &quot;get&quot; diarrhea; he was only soothed by an enormous bowel movement which he saved in his dresser drawer, much to Butt-Head&#x27;s disgust. Beavis sometimes displays savant syndrome, such as when slapped hard by Butt-Head or when attempting to pass out by holding his breath and blowing into his thumb. In this state, Beavis makes intellectual statements, usually regarding the music video he is viewing.

===Beavis&#x27;s parents===
Beavis&#x27; family is occasionally mentioned but has never been seen in the show in person. An example is when Beavis states: &quot;My mom&#x27;s a slut... meh heh heh.&quot; According to discussion during some music video segments, Beavis&#x27; mother shares her son&#x27;s peculiar hairstyle, is somewhat obese, and (most significantly) is an ignorant slut. While Beavis is conscious of his mother&#x27;s promiscuity, it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother him much, as he often laughs along in agreement whenever Butt-Head brings it up (in fact, when Butt-Head refers to Beavis&#x27; mother as a whore, Beavis nonchalantly says &quot;She&#x27;s not a whore, she&#x27;s a slut, she doesn&#x27;t charge for it&quot;). The irony, however, is lost on Butt-Head, whose own mother&#x27;s promiscuity is implied in &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;.

In &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe&quot;, it is revealed that Beavis&#x27; mother&#x27;s name is Shirley Beavis. After the duo disappear into a black hole in 1998 and end up in the year 2022, they are told what happened to her by the real estate agent selling their house. The duo weren&#x27;t paying attention to the story and were busy playing with the garbage disposal which drowned out much of what the real estate agent was saying, but it can be deduced that Shirley Beavis was affected by the loss of her son and she (and possibly Butt-Head&#x27;s mother) won a settlement from NASA but ended up spending it all.

In &quot;Be All You Can Be&quot;, Butt-Head states that Beavis&#x27; father was in the Navy and told the Army recruiter that Beavis&#x27; father was &quot;a seaman&quot;although this could have been a joke designed to allow Butt-Head to use the word &quot;semen&quot;.

In &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;, Beavis is reunited with his biological father, who seems to exhibit the same pyromania obsession as Beavis, as well as an overt physical resemblance. He is said to be a drifter and a one-time roadie for rock band Mötley Crüe. However, they remain oblivious of their father-son relationship and part ways before they make the connection.

===Old Beavis===
In &quot;Mike Judge&#x27;s Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, Beavis and Butt-Head are shown in an alternate timeline as middle-aged adults. The duo live together in an apartment. Beavis maintains the same hairstyle, albeit darker. He also wears glasses, smokes, has a few wrinkles, along with missing or chipped teeth. He no longer wears the Metallica t-shirt of his youth, instead donning a black t-shirt and blue pants. It&#x27;s revealed that Beavis was fired from Burger World in 1999. Beavis and Butt-Head both live on disability and unemployment benefits. In the episode &quot;Kidney&quot;, Beavis accepts a kidney from an adult Stewart after holding in his urine for two days. The kidney bursts from drinking wine after the surgery.

== Cultural impact ==
The song &quot;The Arsonist&quot; by the experimental-rock group Puscifer, off its 2015 album &quot;Money Shot&quot;, explicitly refers to Beavis with the fire theme of the song, including the chorus and a line &quot;Beavis sure do love his matches.&quot;

Beavis and Butt-Head are featured as audience members in an April 2024 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit, with Ryan Gosling as Beavis, and Mikey Day as Butt-Head.

<text>A service star is a miniature bronze or silver five-pointed star in diameter that is authorized to be worn by members of the eight uniformed services of the United States on medals and ribbons to denote an additional award or service period. The service star may also be referred to as a campaign star or battle star depending on which award the star is authorized for and the manner in which the device is used for the award. &quot;Battle star&quot; is also the term used to refer to decorations issued by the United States Navy during World War II and the Korean War to individual ships, recognizing a vessel&#x27;s participation in a particular battle or operation.
Service stars, campaign stars, and battle stars are worn with one point of the star pointing up on the suspension ribbon of a medal or service ribbon. A silver star is worn instead of five bronze stars. A service star is sometimes mistaken for a Bronze Star (Bronze Star Medal) or Silver Star (Silver Star Medal). The service star is also similar to the gold and silver -inch stars that may be authorized to be worn on specific individual decorations of certain services to denote additional decorations.

==Service stars==
===Expeditionary medals===
Service stars are authorized for these United States expeditionary medals:

* Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal
* Navy Expeditionary Medal
* Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal
* Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (GWOT-EM) effective February 9, 2015, retroactive to September 11, 2001. Each star represents a deployment in support of an approved GWOT operation. Four bronze service stars are authorized for five approved deployment operations (only one GWOT-EM is awarded for each operation). The five GWOT-EM-approved operations by inclusive dates are:
** Enduring Freedom: Sep. 11, 2001 – to be determined (TBD)
** Iraqi Freedom: Mar. 19, 2003 – Aug. 31, 2010
** Nomad Shadow: Nov. 05, 2007 – TBD
** New Dawn: Sep. 01, 2010 – Dec. 31, 2011
** Inherent Resolve: Jun. 15, 2014 – TBD

===Service medals===
Service stars are authorized to denoted additional awards for these United States service medals:
* Prisoner of War Medal
* National Defense Service Medal
* Humanitarian Service Medal
* Air and Space Campaign Medal
* Armed Forces Service Medal
* Army Sea Duty Ribbon
* Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal

For the National Defense Service Medal, the addition of bronze service stars to denote participation in four of the designated wartime conflicts would be shown as (the time span from the end of the Korean War era in 1954 to the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism era in 2001 is 47 years, so it is highly improbable that any individual qualified for all four National Defense Service Medals in each of four eras):
: Korean War
: Vietnam War
: Gulf War
: War on Terrorism

===Unit awards===
Service stars are authorized for certain unit awards (The service ribbon itself indicates the first award, with a bronze service star being added to indicate the second and subsequent awards. If ever applicable, a silver service star is worn instead of five bronze stars.) such as the:
* Presidential Unit Citation (Navy and Marine Corps) 
* Navy Unit Commendation (Navy and Marine Corps)

==Campaign stars==
Campaign stars are authorized for these United States campaign medals (bronze and silver campaign stars are worn to denote participation in a designated campaign or campaign phase or period):

* World War I Victory Medal
* American Defense Service Medal
* American Campaign Medal
* Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal
* European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal
* Korean Service Medal
* Vietnam Service Medal
* Southwest Asia Service Medal
* Kosovo Campaign Medal
* Afghanistan Campaign Medal
* Iraq Campaign Medal 
* Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal

For each designated campaign participated in, one star is worn on the ribbon. For example, when a member is authorized to wear the Iraq Campaign Medal, the potential addition of bronze and silver service stars for the seven designated Iraq Campaign phases would be:

For many of these awards, service stars are earned by participation in &quot;campaign phases&quot; and all eligible periods for the award fall within those defined phases. In these cases, the campaign medal cannot be earned alone, and is always to be worn with at least one campaign star.

==Battle stars==
Since February 26, 2004, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWOT-SM) are authorized to be awarded with bronze and silver battle stars for personnel who were engaged in specific battles in combat under circumstances involving grave danger of death or serious bodily injury from enemy action. However, though authorized for wear, no battle stars have been approved for wear. Only a combatant commander can initiate a request for a battle star, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the approving authority, which since January 2016 has been eliminated by the Department of Defense for the GWOT-SM.

Only one award of the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and one award of the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal may be authorized for any individual. No service stars were authorized for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary or Service Medal until February 9, 2015, when the Department of Defense authorized service stars for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal retroactive to September 11, 2001.

== Earlier service stars and battle stars==
Service stars (were sometimes referred to as campaign stars or battle stars) were also authorized for the World War I Victory Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal. The specific manner of wear and symbolism of the stars varied from medal to medal. For example, an American Campaign Medal with a bronze service star indicated the service member had participated in an antisubmarine campaign. On other medals, bronze service stars were used on the medal&#x27;s service ribbon for those recipients of medals in possession of authorized campaign clasps for those medals.

===Navy warships===
Historically, during World War II and the Korean War, commendations called &quot;battle stars&quot; were issued to United States Navy warships for meritorious participation in battle, or for having suffered damage during battle conditions. As an example, the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CV-6) received 20 battle stars for her combat service in World War II, more than any other U.S. vessel during World War II. Similarly, during the Vietnam War and afterwards, the Battle Effectiveness Award (&quot;Battle E&quot;) took the place of receiving &quot;battle stars&quot; for superior battle efficiency in place of combat operations.

<text>Roath () is a district and community to the north-east of the city centre of Cardiff, capital of Wales.
The area is mostly covered by the Plasnewydd electoral ward, and stretches from Adamsdown in the south to Roath Park in the north.

==Description==

Roath&#x27;s main shopping streets are Albany Road, City Road, and Wellfield Road. The area is characterised by its several tree-lined avenues and Victorian era terraced streets. Roath houses a very diverse population including a large number of students, being very close to the main university campuses, a large ethnic minority population and many young professionals. Subdivision of the large Victorian properties is starting to occur in the areas at the south end of the district.

Its close proximity to the city centre, its number of local amenities, churches, shops and restaurants and public houses and Roath Park make it a popular area to live.

The area has five primary schools, Albany Primary School, Marlborough Primary School, Roath Park Primary School, St Peter&#x27;s R.C. Primary School and Stacey Primary School. Community facilities include the YMCA Plas community centre and the Mackintosh Sports Club.

==Etymology==
Samuel Lewis stated that the original name was &quot;Rhâth&quot;, adding that this was a common element in Welsh toponymy denoting ancient earthworks (cognate with &quot;rati&quot;, meaning a fortified enclosure in Gaulish and &quot;ráth&quot;, a ringfort in Old Irish). Lewis further states that several of these earthworks were still visible in his time (likely referring to the earthworks and ditches which had surrounded the old manor house for centuries), suggesting that the area may have been home to an important fortified settlement of the Silures tribe.

Roath has also been identified with &quot;Ratostabius&quot;, a disputed placename found in Ptolomey&#x27;s Geographia. Both William Camden and Iolo Morganwg believed this place was in the vicinity of modern Cardiff, with Iolo suggesting that the Latin name was derived from &quot;Rhath Taff&quot;.

==History==

Roath Court is a nineteenth-century villa on the site of the medieval manor house of Roath. Since 1952 it has been a funeral home. Its Georgian portico, designed by Robert Adam in 1766 for Bowood House, Wiltshire, was moved there in 1956.
Roath contains the Church of Saint Margaret of Antioch, built in 1870 in Gothic revival style on the site of an earlier Norman chapel. Designed by Llandaff architect John Prichard on a Greek Cross plan, it was financed by the third Marquess of Bute, in spite of his conversion to Catholicism in 1868. Inside is an opulent mausoleum housing tombs of nine members of the Bute family, including the first marquess and his two wives. The tower of St Margaret&#x27;s was finally completed in 1926.

Roath once had a railway station on the South Wales Main Line, but this closed in 1917.

Prior to the 2010s the community was known as Plasnewydd, though was renamed as Roath, being a name that was more widely recognised.

<text>Denise Theresa Restout (24 November 1915 – 9 March 2004) was a French keyboard teacher, expert on German and French Baroque performance practice for the keyboard. She was assistant, protégé, domestic partner, editor, and biographer for noted harpsichordist Wanda Landowska.

==Biography==
Born in Paris to Fernand and Juliette (née Frangois) Restout, she earned a Certificate of Primary Studies with honors from the public schools in Paris. She later studied drawing, geometry, history of arts, and painting at the Bazot Studios in Paris, and was admitted to the School of Applied Arts in 1928. Two years later, she received the Frist Medal of the National Conservatory of Music in 1930.

She studied piano, harmony, counterpoint, musicology, voice and organ with expert teachers, and harpsichord, along with keyboard repertoire of the 15th and 18th centuries, with Wanda Landowska, beginning in 1933. Restout worked for a time at the Pleyel Company factory in France. In 1933, she began studying the harpsichord with Landowska and the organ with Joseph Bonnet.

As a performer, Restout appeared at Landowska&#x27;s public master classes in France, the Netherlands and Strasbourg. Landowska, a naturalized French citizen of Polish-Jewish descent, and Restout escaped Saint-Leu-la-Forêt, France, during the Nazi advance in 1940, and arrived in the United States on 7 December 1941 at Ellis Island, the day Pearl Harbor was attacked.

When Landowska died on 16 August 1959, Restout inherited her estate including her papers and collection of musical instruments. She continued to teach at the Landowska Center, their home in Lakeville, Connecticut until her death. Restout became a naturalized United States citizen in 1961. Three years later, in 1964, she published, with the assistance of Robert Hawkins of The Hotchkiss School, &quot;Landowska on Music&quot;, a collection of Landowska&#x27;s writings on music, which included material from &quot;Musique ancienne&quot; which Restout translated into English from the original French, and many of the master-class notes that Restout had saved during their flight from France.

Restout was a faculty member (at large) of the now-defunct Barlow School in Amenia, Dutchess County, New York, the Peabody Conservatory of Music, the Hartt School, University of Southern Mississippi, and Purchase College. Later in life, Restout was organist at Saint Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic church in Lakeville, Connecticut. She was awarded the &quot;Amicus Poloniae&quot; citation by the government of Poland. Restout died in 2004, aged 88, at St. Francis Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut.

<text>Splott () is a district and community in the south of the city of Cardiff, capital of Wales, just east of the city centre. It was built up in the late 19th century on the land of two farms of the same name: Upper Splott and Lower Splott Farms. Splott is characterised by its once vast steelworks and rows of tightly knit terraced houses. The suburb of Splott falls into the Splott electoral ward.

Fanciful suggestions for the origin of the name have included a truncation of &quot;God&#x27;s Plot&quot;, as the land belonged to the Bishop of Llandaff in medieval times, and a derivation of &quot;plat&quot;, meaning a grassy area of land. The name of the original farm would seem to be Middle English , from Old English (&#x27;speck, blot, patch of land&#x27;) and the word is to be found in other English place names in the Vale of Glamorgan, Gower, and Pembrokeshire, as well as in Somerset and Devon, in the West Country of England, from where it was presumably introduced by English settlers. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

The population of Splott in the United Kingdom Census 2001 was 12,074, in 5,101 households, of which only 183 are detached homes. Of the 8,221 adults in the area, only 1,000 have the lowest category of qualifications (Level 1 or below). In 2011 the population had increased to 13,261.

==History==
Splott is a traditional part of the City of Cardiff. Most of the housing stock is Victorian in origin built during the expansion of the city&#x27;s iron and steel industry to house workers in these factories.

The early history of Splott is given in the Cardiff Records. This says that &quot;Splott was anciently held by the Bawdrips of Penmark. It consisted mainly of two farms, called the Upper and Lower Splott, situated between Roath Village and the sea.&quot;
* 1440 – the Splott is mentioned as bounding certain lands of Isabel le Despenser, Countess of Worcester and Warwick.
* 1596 – William Bawdrip of Penmark built a fair house at the Splott and made it his chief residence.
* 1626 – William Bawdrip of Splott was Member of Parliament for Cardiff. He sold Penmark and Splott to Sir Edward Lewis of the Van.
* 1638 – Sir Edward Lewis of the Van died.
* 1740 – the Llandaff Survey of this year mentions a chief rent of four shillings as payable in respect of Splott Farm in Roath.
No residential or industrial development took place in the area, however, until the end of the 19th century. In 1880 the whole area between Cardiff and the Bristol Channel (known as East Moors) was marshland, apart from the farms of Pengam and Splott. Residential development started in the 1880s, constructing streets, houses, shops, taverns and Board Schools; subsequently, Churches were built by various denominations. The streets and housing were laid out by Habershon &amp; Fawckner, architects for the Tredegar Estate. Splott park opened in 1901.

Inevitably there have been many changes in the years since Splott was first developed. Portmanmoor Road is now an industrial estate and its former Victorian era housing was demolished along with adjoining Enid Street, Layard Street, and Menelaus Street which no longer exist.

There is a strong community focus and this is centred on churches, schools, pubs and sporting teams. Roman Catholics remain well catered for through St. Albans and the associated school. This continues to produce rugby teams of all age groups which compete in city leagues. Splott University Settlement was one of the most successful British baseball teams, winning the Welsh League title several times.

Bridgend Street was one of the 17 streets demolished in the early 1970s, but to this day is recalled in the name of Bridgend Street Football Club, which plays in the Welsh Football League. The nickname of Bridgend Street is &quot;The Mission&quot; and motto is &quot;Deeds Not Words&quot;. Their home base is The Fleurs Social Club on Portmanmoor Road.

In 2016 the Tremorfa district, which had previously been included as part of Splott, became a local government community in its own right. There is no community council for the Splott or Tremorfa areas.

In July 2017 the derelict citadel church collapsed with debris falling on the nearby rail line. One man died.

==The Welsh language==
The earliest known example of Welsh-language literature from Splott is a poem by the Elizabethan poet Dafydd Benwyn on the death of William Bawdrip of Splott. It includes the couplet:

With the growth of Splott as a suburb of Cardiff, English was established as the main language.

The number of Welsh speakers in the area increased when East Moors Steelworks was opened in 1891 with large numbers of workers from the parent plant at Dowlais near Merthyr Tydfil. To meet the religious needs of these Welsh-speaking workers, Welsh-language chapels were opened in the area, including Ainon, Walker Road (1894, Welsh Baptists); Bethlehem, Eyre Stree (1895, Welsh Independents); and Jerusalem, Manon Street/Walker Road (1892, Calvinistic Methodists).

According to the 2011 UK Census the number of Splott residents over three years old who could speak Welsh was 1,077 (8.6%).

Splott has one Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Glan Morfa.

==People==
* John Humphrys (radio and TV presenter) was born in Splott.
* Dame Shirley Bassey (singer) originated from nearby Tiger Bay, but moved to Splott at the age of two and attended Moorland Primary School and Splott Secondary Modern School.
*Clive Sullivan (Welsh rugby league player) grew up in Splott.
*Helen Raynor, writer of the &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;Ghost Machine&quot;, which is also largely set there, lives in Splott.
*Lynn Bowles, the morning traffic reporter on BBC Radio 2, was born in Splott.

==Popular culture==
Splott is featured in the third episode (&quot;Ghost Machine&quot;) of the BBC science fiction drama and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;Torchwood&quot;, which is set in Cardiff. It is also mentioned somewhat humorously in other episodes, due to its English pronunciation, which was referred to as &quot;SP-LO-T&quot; but was corrected as &quot;SP-LO&quot;. Splott also features in the &quot;Torchwood&quot; novel &quot;Another Life&quot;.

Splott and the neighbouring district of Tremorfa are the settings for several works by Welsh playwright Peter Gill.

Because the morning BBC Radio 2 traffic reports are read by the Splott-born Lynn Bowles, many listener contributions to the Terry Wogan and Ken Bruce shows feature (primarily fictitious) anecdotes humorously referring to the district. Lynn was affectionately known as &quot;The Totty from Splotty&quot;. On 14 December 2009, Wogan was made &quot;Lord of Splott&quot; live on his radio programme in its final week, by resident and broadcaster Noreen Bray. She invested him on behalf of TAFFS, or Terry&#x27;s Adoring Fans From Splott.

Splott is the setting of “Iphigenia in Splott”, a modern-day reworking of the classic Greek drama, by Welsh playwright Gary Owen. It premiered at Cardiff&#x27;s Sherman Theatre in 2015, before transferring to the National Theatre in London and the 59E59 Theaters in New York in 2016.

==Governance==
Splott is also an electoral ward and parish of Cardiff, Wales. The electoral ward includes the areas of Pengam Green, Splott and Tremorfa. The ward is bounded by Adamsdown and Penylan to the northwest; Rumney and Trowbridge to the north east; the Severn estuary to the south east and Butetown to the south west. It is a multi-member ward, with three councillors. The ward has generally returned Labour party candidates, including Jack Brooks, who served two terms as Leader of South Glamorgan County Council. Gordon Houlston was a Splott Labour Councillor for over 30 years and was Chairman of South Glamorgan County Council, and Deputy Lord Mayor and Lord Mayor of the City of Cardiff. He was made a Papal Knight (KSG) by Pope John Paul 2 for services to the Catholic Church.

Since May 2017, the ward has been represented by Welsh Labour Councillors Jane Henshaw, Ed Stubbs, and Huw Thomas. Huw Thomas is also the current Leader of Cardiff Council.

In the UK Parliament, Splott is part of the constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth. Its most prominent MP was former Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan. The current MP is Labour&#x27;s Stephen Doughty, first elected in 2012.

In the Welsh Senedd, Splott is part of the constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth, whose current MS is Labour&#x27;s Vaughan Gething, first elected in 2011.

==Splott Green Hub==

In October 2018, two Splott residents
Rebecca Clark and Hannah Garcia, launched a public campaign to stop the local council from selling land near Railway Street in Splott for development. A petition protesting against the decision gathered more than 2,500 signatures within five days.

Green City, also known as Green Squirrel, are a community-led environmental group that want to transform the unused site into a new eco-friendly social hub for Splott and Adamsdown. The campaign successfully stopped the sale and the council have now leased the land to the group for community benefit.

According to the 2014 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, Splott and Adamsdown are among the most deprived areas of Wales, and both wards have an open space deficit compared to the standard recreational open space requirement for Cardiff. It is hoped that the Railway Street site can be used to help improve the local community and support other green projects in the area.

According to the project website, plans could include a sustainable community hub building for workshops and events as well as affordable shipping containers for small businesses. Food growing and composting areas, bee hives and other wildlife habitats could also be created on the land to support local biodiversity and outdoor play and learning.

==Cardiff districts==
Splott is part of the STAR area of Cardiff (STAR stands for &quot;Splott, Tremorfa, Adamsdown and Roath&quot;, four inner city suburbs born out of the industrial revolution). The former STAR Centre leisure facility is located in Splott (although this was closed when the new STAR Hub was opened and the former STAR Centre was then utilized by the NHS). Splott Pool was also closed and demolished to make way for the new STAR Hub, that opened in September 2016.

The area is served by Splott Library (within the new hub) and Roath Library. The latter was re-located to the Cardiff Royal Infirmary after the previous branch library building on Newport Road was closed due to prohibitive renovation costs. In January 2017, plans were announced for a new permanent library and cafe in the former hospital chapel. In 2018, a deal was made for the previous library building to be taken over by a local dance organization.

<doc id="845318" wikidata="Q5206083" url="?curid=845318" title="DRYAD">
<text>The DRYAD Numeral Cipher/Authentication System (KTC 1400 D) is a simple, paper cryptographic system employed by the U.S. military for authentication and for encryption of short, numerical messages. Each unit with a radio is given a set of matching DRYAD code sheets. A single sheet is valid for a limited time (e.g. 6 hours), called a &quot;cryptoperiod&quot;.
A DRYAD cipher sheet contains 25 lines or rows of scrambled letters. Each line is labeled by the letters A to Y in a column on the left of the page. Each row contains a random permutation of the letters A through Y. The letters in each row are grouped into 10 columns labeled 0 through 9. The columns under 0, 1, 2 and 5 have more letters than the other digits, which have just two each.

While crude, the DRYAD Numeral Cipher/Authentication System has the advantage of being fast, relatively easy and requires no extra equipment (such as a pencil). The presence of more cipher-text columns under the digits 0, 1, 2 and 5, is apparently intended to make ciphertext frequency analysis more difficult. But much of the security comes from keeping the cryptoperiod short.

DRYAD can be used in two modes, authentication or encryption.

==Authentication==

For authentication, a challenging station selects a letter at random from the left most column followed by a second (randomly selected) letter in the row of the first chosen letter. The station being challenged would then authenticate by picking the letter directly below the row and position of the second letter selected.

For example, using the example cipher sheet to the right and the NATO phonetic alphabet, Jason could challenge Peggy by transmitting &quot;authenticate Alpha Bravo&quot;. Peggy&#x27;s correct response would then be &quot;authenticate Yankee&quot;.

Another form used involves selecting the third letter to the right of the second letter chosen by the challenging station (Jason&#x27;s &quot;Bravo&quot; letter). Both the directional offset (up, down, left or right) and numeral offset can be values different from the examples given here, but must be agreed upon and understood by both parties before authentication.

One problem presented is that an enemy impersonator has a one in 25 chance of guessing the correct response (one in 24 if a letter is selected from the same row). A solution to this is for Jason to require Peggy to authenticate twice; lowering the impersonator&#x27;s odds of guessing the correct response to one in 625. The downside to this method is reduced longevity of the current DRYAD page, since the page is getting twice as much use as a single-authentication scheme.

==Encryption==
The second mode is used to encrypt short numeric information (such as map coordinates or a new radio frequency). The coder arbitrarily selects two letters at random. The first letter designates a row in the current active page. The second one is used similarly to the authentication mode, except that the letter immediately to the right is selected. This selected letter is called the &quot;SET LETTER.&quot;

Numbers are enciphered one digit at a time. A ciphertext letter is chosen from the selected row (the row designated by the SET LETTER) in the column under the plain text digit. If the digit occurs more than once in the number, the coder is instructed to choose a different letter in the same column. All the digits in a single plaintext number are encoded from the same row. (There is also a provision for encoding letters associated with map grid coordinates.)

<text>Justine Lissette &quot;Yostin&quot; Pasek Patiño () is a Soviet-born Polish-Panamanian model and beauty queen who was crowned Miss Universe 2002. Originally the first runner-up at the Miss Universe 2002 competition, Pasek became the first ever runner-up to be crowned the winner after the removal of original winner Oxana Fedorova.

==Early life==
Pasek was born in Kharkiv, USSR, to a Panamanian mother and a Polish father; her mother was a homemaker, while her father was an engineer. Despite her birth name being Yostin, Pasek was raised being affectionately referred to by her Polish name Justyna. She is the eldest of three children. The family resided in Soviet Ukraine for one year, and later moved to the village of Wożuczyn, near Zamość in southeastern Poland, close to the border with Ukraine. After her mother finished her studies in chemistry, the family left Poland and settled in Panama City, where Pasek was raised.

She has been the image model of numerous international brands and is a Goodwill Ambassador of FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). 
In 2016, Pasek is the co-owner of the Señorita Panamá Organization and new national director for Miss Universe.

==Career==
Pasek&#x27;s start in the modelling world took place when she joined the &quot;Chica Modelo&quot; (a model search) contest in 1996 where she won the award for Best Editorial Model. It also gave her the chance to work for Physical Modelos, her official modeling agency as of today.

===Pageantry===
After participating in the national contest Señorita Panamá 2001 on August 30, 2001; she won the Señorita Panamá Universe title, and represented her country at Miss Universe 2002, at the Coliseo Roberto Clemente, San Juan, Puerto Rico on May 29, 2002. She finished as first runner-up.

Four months after the pageant, Pasek became the first woman to assume the crown when the reigning Miss Universe Oxana Fedorova was removed by the organization for not fulfilling the duties stipulated in her contract. Pasek became the first Panamanian and Central American Miss Universe.

Pasek was formally crowned Miss Universe 2002 by then pageant co-owner Donald Trump in New York City. Pasek also received the Mikimoto Crown worth $250,000 in addition to an extensive prize package. As Miss Universe, Pasek represented the Miss Universe Organization. A self-described &quot;citizen of the world&quot;, Pasek has since traveled to Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Egypt, Aruba, Ecuador, Peru, Cuba, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. She championed the cause against HIV/AIDS and established the first HIV/AIDS prevention center in her country. As part of her year-long reign as Miss Universe, she lived in New York City in a riverside apartment provided by the Miss Universe Organization. She worked with the Global Health Council, the Harvard AIDS Institute, AmFAR, and the Centers for Disease Control&#x27;s &quot;Act Now&quot; campaign.

<text>Joan Dawson Bakewell, Baroness Bakewell (&quot;née&quot; Rowlands; born 16 April 1933), is an English journalist, television presenter and Labour Party peer. Baroness Bakewell is president of Birkbeck, University of London; she is also an author and playwright, and has received a Humanist of the Year award for services to humanism.

==Early life and education==
Bakewell was born on 16 April 1933 in Heaton Moor, Stockport, Cheshire, England, and moved to Hazel Grove before she was three. Both her grandfathers were factory workers: the Rowlands branch stemmed from the lead mining villages of the Ystwyth valley, in Wales. Her great-grandfather moved to Salford, where he was a preacher in the Church Army. Her grandfather was an iron turner. On the maternal side, her grandfather was a cooper in Ardwick Brewery. The family lived in Gorton, a district of Manchester.

Bakewell was educated at Stockport High School for Girls, a grammar school in local authority control, where she became head girl. She won a scholarship and attended Newnham College, Cambridge, where she studied Economics, then History, and joined the Marshall Society and the Mummers Acting Society.

==Career==

===Broadcasting===
Joan Bakewell began her career as a studio manager for BBC Radio, before moving into television. Bakewell then left after a year to try supply teaching. She then became an advertising copywriter with McCann Erickson, then with Hobson Bates, and later David Williams Ltd. In the early 60s Bakewell was TV presenter for ATV’s Sunday Break, Southern Television’s Home at 4.30, BBC’s Meeting Point and the BBC series The Second Sex.

She first became known as one of the presenters of the BBC2 programme &quot;Late Night Line-Up&quot; (1965–72 and 2008). Frank Muir dubbed her &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s crumpet&quot; during this period and the moniker stuck, but Bakewell herself dislikes the epithet. In 1968, she took the role of narrator of the BBC TV production of &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, a three-part serial, and played a TV interviewer in the 1960s film &quot;The Touchables&quot;.

Bakewell co-presented &quot;Reports Action&quot;, a Sunday teatime programme which encouraged the public to donate their services to various good causes, for Granada Television in 1976–78. In the 1970s Bakewell worked for both the BBC: &quot;Where is Your God?&quot;, &quot;Who Cares&quot; &quot;The Affirmative Way&quot; and many Holiday Programmes between 1974 and 1978. Bakewell starred in 4 series of Granada’s pioneering Reports Action, a series that first encouraged the public to contribute goods and services to good causes. Subsequently, she returned to the BBC, and co-presented a short-lived late-night television arts programme, briefly worked on the BBC Radio 4 &quot;PM&quot; programme, and was &quot;Newsnight&quot;″s arts correspondent (1986–88). Arts coverage was then dropped from news programmes in the era of John Birt&#x27;s changes to the BBC. Bakewell switched to being the main presenter of the ethics documentary series &quot;Heart of the Matter&quot;, which she presented for 12 years. She resigned from the programme in 1999.

In 2001, Bakewell wrote and presented a four-part series for BBC Two called &quot;Taboo&quot;, a personal exploration of the concepts of taste, decency and censorship. The programme dealt frankly with sex and nudity and in some cases pushed the boundaries of what is permissible on mainstream television. Bakewell used frank language and &quot;four-letter words&quot; to describe pornography and sex toys. She watched a couple having sex while they were making a pornographic film and read out an &quot;obscene&quot; extract from the novel &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; by Henry Miller.

&quot;Taboo&quot; was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association, then headed by John Beyer. Following the complaint, Bakewell faced the nominal prospect of being charged with blasphemous libel after she recited part of an erotic poem by James Kirkup concerning a Roman centurion&#x27;s affection for Jesus, &quot;The Love that Dares to Speak its Name&quot;. After its first publication in 1976, Denis Lemon, the editor of &quot;Gay News&quot;, had been given a nine-month suspended jail sentence. Bakewell later wrote that in the programme she &quot;read this poem with extreme distaste and I hope that showed on my face.&quot; The Broadcasting Standards Commission rejected complaints from viewers.

On 26 May 2008, Bakewell introduced an archive evening on BBC Parliament called &quot;Permissive Night&quot;. The programme examined the liberalising legislation passed by Parliament in the late 1960s. Topics covered included changes to divorce law, the death penalty, the legalisation of abortion, the Race Relations Bill, the partial decriminalisation of homosexual acts (using editions of the documentary series &quot;Man Alive&quot;) and the relaxation of censorship. &quot;Permissive Night&quot; concluded with a special one-off edition of &quot;Late Night Line-Up&quot; which discussed the themes raised in the programmes over the course of the evening.

In 2009, she won the category Journalist of the Year at the annual Stonewall Awards.

In 2017, Bakewell was one of the minor hosts of the Channel 5 documentary series &quot;Secrets of the National Trust&quot;.

On Sky Arts, Bakewell co-hosted &quot;Portrait Artist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Landscape Artist of the Year&quot;, initially alongside Frank Skinner and later Stephen Mangan. 

===Writing===
Bakewell writes for the British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; in the &quot;Editorial and Opinion&quot; section. Typically, her articles concern aspects of social life and culture but sometimes she writes more political articles, often focusing on aspects relevant to life in the United Kingdom. Formerly, from 2003, she wrote the &quot;Just Seventy&quot; column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. In September 2008, she began a fortnightly column in the Times2 section of &quot;The Times&quot;.

Her first novel was published in March 2009 by Virago Press. &quot;All the Nice Girls&quot; drew on her experiences in war-time Merseyside to tell the story of a school &quot;adopting&quot; a ship.

==Public roles==
She is chairman of the theatre company Shared Experience.

She is a Patron for the Plaza Cinema, Stockport.

It was announced in November 2010 that she would be awarded a life peerage, joining the Labour benches. She was created Baroness Bakewell, of Stockport in the County of Greater Manchester, on 21 January 2011, and formally introduced to the House of Lords on 25 January 2011 supported by fellow Labour peers Lord Puttnam and Baroness Kennedy.

In September 2017, Bakewell was elected co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, the cross-party group that represents humanists in Parliament.

==Views and advocacy==
In 2008, Bakewell criticised the absence of older women on British television. She said: &quot;I think the fact that people are phased out, people like Moira Stuart and Selina [Scott] – out of the public eye – when they become a certain age is a real disadvantage to serious broadcasting. There&#x27;s a whole segment of the British population that does not see its equivalent in serious broadcasting and that is women over 55. Now, that is not healthy for a broadcasting organisation&#x27;s relationship with its audience. The public should be represented on the screen in various colours, forms, sexualities, whatever.&quot;

In 2010, Bakewell criticised the side effects of the sexual revolution of the 1960s. She said: &quot;I never thought I would hear myself say as much, but I&#x27;m with Mrs Whitehouse on this one. The liberal mood back in the &#x27;60s was that sex was pleasurable and wholesome and shouldn&#x27;t be seen as dirty and wicked. The Pill allowed women to make choices for themselves. Of course, that meant the risk of making the wrong choice. But we all hoped girls would grow to handle the new freedoms wisely. Then everything came to be about money: so now sex is about money, too. Why else sexualise the clothes of little girls, run TV channels of naked wives, have sex magazines edging out the serious stuff on newsagents&#x27; shelves? It&#x27;s money that&#x27;s corrupted us and women are being used and are even collaborating.&quot;

In August 2014, Bakewell was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In March 2016, she commented in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that anorexia is connected with a general narcissism in 21st century western culture, and that &quot;no-one has anorexia in societies where there is not enough food&quot;. Despite agreement with her assessment in some media, her comments also provoked strong criticism from social and print media, and an apology for hurt caused from Bakewell herself.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bakewell said that the Government should stop treating the elderly like &quot;a crazy old people&#x27;s club&quot; and allow them to make their own choices on how best to ensure their personal safety.

==Honours==
She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1999 Birthday Honours and was Chairman of the British Film Institute from 2000 to 2002. She was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

In 2007, she was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (D.Litt) from the University of Chester. On 20 July 2011, Bakewell was made an honorary graduate at the University of Essex (DU Essex).

Bakewell has also received honorary degrees from Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh (2005), Royal Holloway, University of London, University of the Arts London (2008), Staffordshire University (2009), Lancaster University (2010), Newcastle University (2011), Open University (2010) and Manchester Metropolitan University (2013). She was made an Honorary Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge, in 2016.

In 2017, the charity Humanists UK awarded Bakewell its prize for Humanist of the Year, in recognition of her achievements in broadcasting and services to humanism and other good causes. In 2011, she was appointed Baroness Bakewell of Stockport.

==Personal life==
Bakewell&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Centre of the Bed&quot;, was published in 2003 and concentrates on her experiences as a woman in the male-dominated media industry. It also details the extramarital affair Bakewell had with playwright Harold Pinter (between 1962 and 1969), while she was married to Michael Bakewell (the marriage lasted from 1955 to 1972) and Pinter was married to the actress Vivien Merchant. The affair was the basis for Pinter&#x27;s 1978 play &quot;Betrayal&quot;, adapted in 1983 as a film. In 2017, &quot;Keeping in Touch&quot;, a play first written by Bakewell in 1978 in response to &quot;Betrayal&quot;, premiered on BBC Radio 4.

In 1975, she married Jack Emery, a British director, writer and producer for stage, TV and radio, who was 12 years her junior. The couple divorced in 2001. Bakewell said, &quot;The age difference did matter, but other things mattered more.&quot;

For years, she received poison-pen letters from a stalker obsessed with women in the public eye. She appeared on &quot;Crimewatch&quot; in March 2001 in an appeal to catch the culprit.

In January 2023, Bakewell announced that she had been diagnosed with colon cancer.

<text>Braintree Rural District was a local government district in the county of Essex, England. Established under the Local Government Act of 1894, it served as an administrative division in the rural areas surrounding Braintree.

== History ==
Braintree Rural District was created in 1894 as part of widespread local government reforms. It initially encompassed numerous civil parishes within the county of Essex.

In 1934, the district underwent significant changes when the parish of Bocking was removed and merged into the newly established Braintree and Bocking Urban District. This division resulted in the rural district being split into two separate geographical areas. Despite this reorganization, the district retained its name and was administered from Bocking.

On 1 April 1974, the district was abolished under the Local Government Act of 1972. Its area was incorporated into the newly formed Braintree District, which combined several urban and rural areas in the region.

== Civil Parishes ==
At the time of its dissolution in 1974, Braintree Rural District comprised 20 civil parishes:

* Bardfield Saling
* Black Notley
* Bradwell
* Coggeshall
* Cressing
* Fairstead
* Faulkbourne
* Feering
* Finchingfield
* Great Bardfield
* Great Saling
* Hatfield Peverel
* Kelvedon
* Panfield
* Rayne
* Shalford
* Stisted
* Terling
* Wethersfield
* White Notley

== Legacy ==
The Braintree Rural District&#x27;s legacy continues as part of the larger administrative area of the District of Braintree, which governs a mix of urban and rural communities.

<doc id="845324" wikidata="Q3397990" url="?curid=845324" title="Llanishen">
<text>Llanishen (, &quot;llan&quot; church + &quot;Isien&quot; Saint Isan) is a district and community in the north of Cardiff, Wales. Its population as of the 2011 census was 17,417.
Llanishen is the home of the former HMRC tax offices, the tallest buildings in north Cardiff and a landmark for miles around. The office complex overlooks the Crystal and Fishguard estates, the Parc Tŷ Glas industrial estate, Llanishen village, leafy suburban roads and parks that constitute the district. Llanishen is also home to a leisure centre and the former Llanishen Reservoir, which is connected to a green corridor which bisects the city.

==History==
Originally wooded farm land, in A.D. 535 two monks came eastwards from the small religious settlement of Llandaff, aiming to establish new settlements, or &quot;llans&quot;, in the land below Caerphilly Mountain. With fresh water from the Nant Fawr stream, one of the monks, Isan, founded his llan on the site of the modern day Oval Park.

In 1089 at the Battle of the Heath, the Normans fought the Welsh Celts north of the settlement. The victorious Normans expanded Llanishen, starting work on a church to the north which was completed in the 12th century.

Although Oliver Cromwell had ties with Llanishen and the neighbouring village of Lisvane, the village remained undisturbed until 1871, when the Rhymney Railway was given permission to break the stranglehold of the Taff Vale Railway into Cardiff Docks. Building a line from Caerphilly to Crockherbtown Junction just north of Cardiff Queen Street, its tunnel to the north resulted in the accidental deaths of a number of people, many of them buried in St Isan&#x27;s church.

The railway and the development of Llanishen railway station allowed wealthy Cardiff businesspeople to commute from the village to the city centre easily, resulting in the expansion of the village&#x27;s population by 20,000 between 1851 and 1871. In 1887, the two new reservoirs of Llanishen were built to allow distribution of water collected in the Brecon Beacons to the city. In 1922, after expansion north by the city and south by the village, Llanishen became a suburb of Cardiff. Llanishen Golf Club was established in 1905.

Development of the village since has been through redevelopment of former farming and military land into commercial usage and housing development.

Thornhill was part of the Llanishen civil parish until November 2016, when a new community of Thornhill was created north of the Linear Park.

==Commerce and industry==

===Parc Tŷ Glas Industrial Estate===

Parc Tŷ Glas is home to the offices of the television station S4C and of the National Eisteddfod of Wales. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) formerly occupied Ty Glas, an 18-storey tower block (Phase 2), the 11-storey Gleider House (Phase 1), Ty Rhodfa (formerly the Valuation Office Agency) employing more than 2,700 staff on site in 2007 and ground floor offices for an enquiry centre or IREC. In 2020 the tax office vacated the site and moved to Central Square in the city centre.

The HM Government buildings are due to be demolished and replaced by up to 250 houses, 70 retirement apartments, a care home, employment units, and a health centre.

In 2003, Cardiff Lifestyle Shopping Park was built, comprising six stores. The current occupants are Marks and Spencer Simply Food, Boots, HomeSense, Starbucks, DW Sports/MiFit and Pets at Home.

===ROF Cardiff===
Llanishen played a role in the Second World War effort. With the development of ROF Bridgend, a Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Cardiff was opened in 1940 to take the explosives from Bridgend and produce tank, anti-tank and field guns. Air defences against paratroopers were placed in nearby fields, and facilities were strengthened in 1941 when the Royal Air Force established both a RAF Regiment base and a glider training facility. In 1943 the United States Army began using the facilities to hold troops and undertake local training, including basic flight in Tiger Cubs. The Americans left in June 1944 as the Allies prepared for D-Day. In 1987 ROF Cardiff became an Atomic Weapons Establishment. It closed down in February 1997.

Since its closure, ROF Cardiff has become the site of major housing developments by George Wimpey (called Parklands), Barratt (Ty Glas Square) and Leadbitter (Llys Enfys. Bellway and Persimmon/Charles Church created further housing between the AWE site and the HMRC building. The site will also host a new public open space, the final element to be constructed (2010), to include a children&#x27;s play area, sports pitch and community garden. Part of the George Wimpey development has been named Watkins Square and the Barratt development Tasker Square – after Wales&#x27; famous Victoria Cross winner Sir Tasker Watkins, who died during 2007.

===Other offices===

The Orchards complex, formerly the site of the National Coal Board&#x27;s regional office, housed the offices of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and the Welsh office of the Camelot Group, operators of the UK National Lottery. In 2018, the Orchards were demolished and McCarthy and Stone built an independent living complex called Llys Faith.

==Shopping and leisure==
===Llanishen village===
Llanishen village is a small local shopping centre offering a range of shops and services to the surrounding community.

Llanishen Library is a full-time branch library.

===Llanishen and Lisvane Reservoirs===

The area includes two non-functional reservoirs, Llanishen Reservoir and the smaller, adjoining Lisvane Reservoir. Llanishen Reservoir forms the end of a Victorian water supply system stretching from the Brecon Beacons to Cardiff. It was previously threatened by an American-led commercial development for domestic housing, where the proposed houses would be built around a reduced lake. However, the site was designation by Cadw and as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, making it difficult for the developer to gain building permission. Locals have campaigned to make the area a registered village green.

===Cardiff Sailing Centre===

Cardiff Sailing Centre (&quot;Llanishen Sailing Centre&quot;) is a sailing school teaching sailing, windsurfing and powerboating.

===Sports facilities===

Llanishen Leisure Centre is situated in Llanishen and is the largest in the city. It has a pool with a wave machine, Squash courts, multi-activity sports hall, gym and cafeteria. It is built in a very similar layout to the leisure centre in Pentwyn.

There is a public skatepark next to the leisure centre, featuring two quarter-pipes, a jump box, two flat banks, a driveway, a spine, a rail, a wallride and a halfpipe. Llanishen is also home to RampWorld Cardiff, which is Wales&#x27; largest indoor skatepark and operates as a non-profit making charity to provide indoor extreme sports training facilities.

GoAir Trampoline Park is located on the Ty Glas Business Park in Llanishen.

Llanishen RFC is based in the area and has a 3G rugby ground, built in 2018 as part of a new partnership with Llanishen High School. The club house is off Ty Glas Avenue nearby. The club&#x27;s former training ground and pitch was located off Usk Road and was sold to a housing developer to fund the new 3G pitch facilities 

===Public houses===
Llanishen&#x27;s pubs include the Church Inn, believed to be the oldest surviving pub in Cardiff, and the Wolf&#x27;s Castle.

<doc id="845325" wikidata="Q7838183" url="?curid=845325" title="Tremorfa">
<text>is a district and community of the city of Cardiff, Wales. It falls into the Splott ward of Cardiff.

==Transport==
Tremorfa is served by the Cardiff Bus 11 route (was 61 for a few years as the Pentrebane route was extended) operating from Pengam Green to the city centre via Tremorfa, Splott and Adamsdown. It is also served by the numbers 1 and 2 City Circle service.

==Employment==
The rate of unemployment in Tremorfa is both higher than the average for Cardiff and higher than the national average, suggesting that finding a job in this area may be hard. The rate of claiming any benefit (which includes in work benefits) is more than 10% lower in Tremorfa than the national average, suggesting higher salaries than the average in the area.

===Social grade and occupation statistics===
Social grade is a classification based on occupation and it enables a household and all its members to be classified according to the job of the main income earner. Tremorfa has 20% more higher and intermediate managerial, administrative or professional households than the national average.

==Education==
Education statistics are for the highest level education obtained by the residents of Tremorfa and are from the UK Census of 2011. Tremorfa has a lower level of residents with either no qualifications or qualifications equal to 1 or more GCSE at grade D or below, than the national average. Tremorfa also has a high level of residents with a higher education qualification (level 4) than the national average.

===Schools===
Tremorfa is served by several schools. The only high school is Willows High School which is situated on Willows avenue. The school was once described as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; and in need of &quot;significant improvement&quot; by the education watchdog Estyn. The school has now substantially improved and is no longer requiring significant improvement. Willows High was featured in the Channel 4 documentary Educating Cardiff in 2015. One of the primary schools across the road from STAR HYB is Baden Powell Primary.

==Government==

In 2016 Tremorfa became one of four new communities in Cardiff, having previously been part of the Splott community. There is no community council for the area. The nearby area of Pengam Green, which is connected through Tremorfa Park, is classed as being part of the Tremorfa community.

==Events==
In December 2015, Christmas &#x27;Pugfest&#x27; was held at Action Petz play centre in Tremorfa, with more than 1,500 visitors and around 400 pugs. It was one of the fun events for pugs set up nationally by Rob Clowes in memory of his dog, Poppy. In 2017 Prince Harry and his now wife Megan Markle visited the Star Hub, across the road from Baden Powell Primary School. Around 2000 people turned up just to see them pull up in the Range Rover Sport with an escort of Motorbikes and Police cars and secret service vehicles.

<text>David Lee Emerson, (born September 17, 1945) is a Canadian economist, financial executive, and politician. He was formerly the Member of Parliament for the riding of Vancouver Kingsway. He was first elected as a Liberal and served as Minister of Industry under Prime Minister Paul Martin. After controversially crossing the floor to join Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservatives, he served as Minister of International Trade and Minister for the Pacific Gateway and the Vancouver-Whistler Olympics, followed by Minister of Foreign Affairs.

== Early life and business career ==
Emerson was born in Montreal, Quebec. He attended the University of Alberta and obtained his Bachelor of Economics degree in 1968 and his Master of Economics degree in 1970. He then went on to Queen&#x27;s University where he received his Ph.D in economics.

In 1975, after working as a researcher for the Economic Council of Canada, Emerson moved to British Columbia and joined the public service. In 1984, he became deputy minister of finance.

In 1986, Emerson was appointed president and chief executive officer of the Western &amp; Pacific Bank of Canada. He transformed it into the Western Bank of Canada — the only regional bank to survive and prosper. Four years later, he returned as deputy minister of finance and was quickly promoted to deputy minister to the premier and president of the British Columbia Trade Development Corporation.

From 1992 to 1997, Emerson was president and chief executive officer of the newly created Vancouver International Airport Authority.

In 1998, Emerson was appointed president and chief executive officer of Canfor Corporation, a leading integrated forest products company and Canada&#x27;s largest producer of softwood lumber. With 8,100 workers and annual revenues of $3.2 billion servicing 10% of the U.S. market, Canfor operates pulp and paper mills as well as 19 sawmills across British Columbia, two in Alberta and one in Quebec. Despite US duties and a higher Canadian dollar, Emerson managed to increase profits and raise share prices through a major acquisition deal and efficiency upgrades, which increased capacity by 30% while reducing production costs by 24%.

In 2008, Emerson joined private equity firm CAI Capital Management as a senior advisor.

Emerson&#x27;s directorships included: Terasen Inc; Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada; vice-chairman of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives; Chair, British Columbia Ferry Services Inc.; and chairman and director of Genus Resource Management Technologies Inc.

== Election history ==
Bypassing the nomination process, Paul Martin appointed David Emerson as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Kingsway for the 2004 election. In the general election, he narrowly defeated Ian Waddell of the New Democratic Party (NDP) by 1,351 votes. Waddell had previously represented Vancouver Kingsway from 1979 until 1988, when the riding was abolished and Waddell transferred to Port Moody—Coquitlam.

The 2006 election saw a rematch between Emerson and Waddell. This time, Emerson won handily, defeating Waddell by nearly 10 points as the Liberals nearly swept Vancouver.

Emerson attracted some media attention in December 2005 with a comment that NDP leader Jack Layton had a &quot;boiled dog&#x27;s head smile&quot;. While the term is translated from the common and mild Cantonese insult &quot;烚熟狗頭&quot;, Emerson said that he believed it to be a humorous phrase indicating a person with an &quot;overextended grin&quot;. Emerson said that his wife, a Cantonese speaker, used the phrase to describe him when he posed for pictures.

==Crossing the floor==
At some point between election day and the day Stephen Harper was due to be sworn in as prime minister, Emerson accepted an offer from Harper to cross the floor and become Minister of International Trade in Harper&#x27;s new Conservative minority government. According to Emerson, British Columbia Conservative campaign coordinator John Reynolds called him the day after the election to ask if he was interested in having a conversation with Harper.

Gaining regional representation in Cabinet from key metropolitan areas, such as Vancouver, according to Harper, was key to the decision in asking Emerson to cross the floor. Indeed, 2006 marked the first time in decades that a centre-right party had been completely shut out in Vancouver. However, Emerson&#x27;s Conservative opponent, Kanman Wong, claimed on February 10, 2006, that Emerson was seriously considering crossing the floor during the run-up to the election. Wong added that he would have stood down in Emerson&#x27;s favour had he done so.

In any case, Emerson&#x27;s decision was kept secret from his Liberal colleagues, the press, and even most Conservatives until February 6, 2006, when he arrived at Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Governor General, for the swearing-in of the new government. In addition to his International Trade portfolio, Emerson was given responsibility for the Pacific Gateway and the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, areas of particular importance to the riding of Vancouver-Kingsway and in general, the Greater Vancouver area. He was ranked third in Cabinet in the order of precedence, behind Harper and House Leader Rob Nicholson, by virtue of his appointment to the Privy Council in 2004.

Emerson had given no public indication that he was thinking of leaving the Liberal Party during the election campaign, Wong&#x27;s remarks notwithstanding. As a Cabinet minister he had been featured prominently in Liberal TV ads in British Columbia promoting that party as the best choice for voters. He launched several blistering attacks against Harper and the Conservatives during the campaign, including one assertion that under a Harper government, &quot;the strong [would] survive and the weak die&quot;. On election night, he told supporters that he wanted to be &quot;Stephen Harper&#x27;s worst nightmare.&quot; In an interview with CTV after being sworn in, he clarified to reporters about the heated partisan rhetoric used during the campaign. Emerson told CTV that he runs his riding office on a nonpartisan basis, and that his first priority was the interests of the people of Vancouver Kingsway.

===Controversy===

Part of the Emerson controversy stems from Vancouver Kingsway&#x27;s voting history. The riding has long been one of the more left-leaning ones in Vancouver; most election battles take place between the Liberals and NDP. Vancouver Kingsway previously existed from 1953 to 1988 and elected a Progressive Conservative candidate only once, during the 1958 Tory landslide. It has not elected a Conservative or any member of its predecessor parties—the PCs, the Reform Party of Canada or the Canadian Alliance—since its recreation in 1997. The Conservative candidate in 2006, Wong, finished a distant third with only 8,700 votes—12,000 votes behind Emerson and 7,000 behind Waddell—and 19% of the total vote. In the 2004 election, the Conservative candidate, Jesse Johl, finished with 16.5% of the vote. Both totals were far less than the combined PC/Canadian Alliance vote of 34.4% in 2000. The NDP&#x27;s vote share of less than 16% in that 2000 election jumped to more than 37% when Emerson first ran in 2004.

Liberal MP and former Minister of Health, Ujjal Dosanjh noted that a poll held prior to the election showed less than 20 per cent of residents in the riding knew Emerson by name, lending credence to the assertions that the Liberal banner played a large part in his election and re-election.

Liberal National President Mike Eizenga said that Emerson knew &quot;if he was running in that riding as a Conservative, he wouldn&#x27;t have a chance&quot; and has demanded his resignation. Democracy Watch, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog, said it planned to complain to the Ethics Commissioner since Emerson was still technically a Liberal minister when he accepted Harper&#x27;s offer. The group claimed that Emerson&#x27;s switch violated the federal ethics code and post-employment regulations for officeholders. NDP MP Peter Julian has also called for an inquiry, claiming that the additional benefits Emerson received as a member compared to those he would have received as an opposition MP carry at least the appearance that Emerson acted in his own private interest.

Bill Graham, acting parliamentary leader of the Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition, called Emerson&#x27;s behaviour cynical and claimed his actions diminished &quot;the faith of citizens in a system under which we have to govern.&quot; Martin, who left on a vacation to Europe shortly after resigning as prime minister, was &quot;astonished&quot; by Emerson&#x27;s defection and criticized both Emerson and Harper for avoiding &quot;an appropriate level of scrutiny on this matter -- a decision that I believe robs Canadians and the people of Vancouver Kingsway of a deserved explanation&quot;.

Criticism also came from Emerson&#x27;s fellow Conservatives. Garth Turner, a Conservative MP from Ontario said that &quot;anyone who crosses the floor ultimately should go back to the people for ratification and I stick by it and hopefully in this case that will happen...&quot; Turner later stated his belief that his criticism &quot;seriously limited&quot; his future in the party. Subsequently, he was eventually kicked out of the Conservative caucus and crossed the floor to sit as a Liberal for which he was also criticized. Myron Thompson of Alberta has also called for Emerson to step down and run in a by-election.

However, MacKay told CTV&#x27;s Mike Duffy Live that Emerson wanted to continue and finish the work he already started as Minister of Industry under Martin on a multibillion-dollar softwood lumber deal with the United States—a deal that could potentially bring a huge windfall to Canada and particularly Emerson&#x27;s major lumber producing province, British Columbia.

MacKay later also said that there was no comparison between Emerson&#x27;s switch and that of Belinda Stronach. Reynolds also defended Emerson&#x27;s switch, saying that Vancouver Kingsway got the better end of the bargain since &quot;instead of having someone in opposition, they have someone who is a cabinet minister of a new government.&quot; As Minister of International Trade, Emerson will have key influence on matters relevant to constituents of Vancouver-Kingsway particularly as The Greater Vancouver Area prepares for the 2010 Olympics. The defection also has the support of Vancouver Mayor Sam Sullivan, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell, the Vancouver Board of Trade, former Prime Minister Kim Campbell, as well as several prominent businessmen in Vancouver.

In a letter dated Monday February 6, the Vancouver Kingsway Liberal riding association requested that Emerson repay $97,000 spent during his re-election campaign. Emerson has stated that he does not intend to repay any expenses, arguing that he has raised large sums for the Liberal party from his corporate connections. On February 8, 2006, Emerson described Liberal attacks on his defection as a sign of &quot;deep sickness&quot; and said that his children were being treated with hostility at school because of his defection. Harper called the attacks on Emerson &quot;superficial&quot;, the switch was made &quot;in the best interests of not just British Columbia but good government&quot;. Emerson has given some thought to resigning over the furore, but told CBC News in Vancouver on February 10 that he would not resign or run in a byelection. Aside from that appearance, Emerson cancelled a telephone press conference on February 9 due to traffic.

The furore has reinvigorated support for legislation requiring MPs who switch parties to step down and run for their own vacancy in a by-election. NDP MP Peter Stoffer announced on February 13 that he would reintroduce a private member&#x27;s bill making such a provision. Turner plans to introduce a similar bill, despite pressure from his party to back off. Speaking on Vancouver radio station CKNW, Emerson said he would be glad to discuss the bill in Parliament: &quot;I&#x27;ll participate in that debate, I may even vote for it, and I will certainly abide by it.&quot; Stoffer&#x27;s earlier floor-crossing bill (C-251) was defeated during the last Canadian Parliament. Emerson has vowed to resign only if such a law were passed retroactively or if the ethics commissioner found him to be at fault.

A crowd of over 700 gathered at an NDP-organized protest rally in Emerson&#x27;s riding on Saturday February 11. Another smaller rally took place at Emerson&#x27;s riding office the next day. On April 2, a crowd, variously estimated between 1000 and 1200 participated in a Walk for Democracy organized by a group calling themselves Real Democracy. At times the tightly packed crowd stretched out over five blocks along one lane of Kingsway as the march proceeded along the 2 kilometre route past Emerson&#x27;s constituency office to the rally. The next day, another group flew an airplane over Canada&#x27;s parliament asking the Member of Parliament to &quot;call home&quot;. This was in reference to the fact that David Emerson had remained low key and made few public appearances in the riding for the months of February and March.

According to an online poll from The Globe and Mail, 77% of respondents wanted Emerson to step down and run in a by-election. A similar online poll conducted by Maclean&#x27;s magazine showed 66% wanted Emerson to run in a by-election. Ipsos Reid in mid-February 2006 conducted a poll of British Columbians and found that even in staunchly Conservative areas of the province, respondents were 75% in favour of a by-election being called.

On March 3, 2006, Ethics Commissioner Bernard Shapiro announced that he was launching a preliminary inquiry into conflict-of-interest allegations against Emerson and Harper. Shapiro says he will look into what influence may have been wielded in the decision by Emerson to cross the floor. On March 20, 2006, Shapiro stated that he was &quot;satisfied that no special inducement was offered by Mr. Harper to convince Mr. Emerson to join his cabinet and his party&quot;. He found no wrongdoing on Emerson&#x27;s part and recommended a parliamentary debate on floor crossing.

==Resolution of softwood lumber issue==
On April 27, 2006, Prime Minister Harper announced that Canada had reached an agreement with the United States on softwood lumber. Working closely with Minister Emerson and Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Michael Wilson, this landmark agreement resolved a dispute disrupting Canada–U.S. relations since 1982 when U.S. lumber producers first petitioned against Canadian softwood lumber imports under U.S. countervailing duty law. Previous Liberal governments had enacted two five-year deals, the last one expiring March 31, 2001. Since then, Canada had been locked in costly domestic and international litigation as U.S. lumber companies charged Canada with dumping subsidized lumber into the U.S. market.

The softwood lumber deal ensured no quotas or tariffs at current lumber prices, repayment of at least $4 billion in unfairly collected duties to lumber companies, and provincial and regional flexibility depending on operating conditions. &quot;Canada’s bargaining position was strong; our conditions were clear; and this agreement delivers&quot;, said the prime minister. &quot;It’s a good deal that resolves this long-standing dispute and allows us to move on.&quot; The deal also received support from Canada&#x27;s three major softwood producing provinces, British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario.

Following the initial announcement, the province of British Columbia expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement&#x27;s details. Claiming industry support, B.C.&#x27;s forestry minister, Rich Coleman, threatened to &quot;derail the deal&quot; if the provincial government&#x27;s concerns were not met. Under contention were several details, including an &quot;opt-out&quot; clause (allowing either Canadian or U.S. governments to back out of the deal after 23 months).

A number of analysts described the deal as a shameful capitulation of Canadian interests. The deal included language requiring all Canadian companies to drop legal actions against the U.S. government.

On September 12, 2006, Emerson and U.S Trade Representative Susan Schwab officially signed the deal in Ottawa.

The softwood lumber deal was passed on December 6, 2006, and received Royal Assent on December 12, 2006.

==Foreign Affairs ministry==
On May 26, 2008, Emerson was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs following the resignation of Maxime Bernier, though it was reported at the time that Emerson&#x27;s appointment to the position would be brief. In a cabinet shuffle on June 25, 2008, Prime Minister Harper finalized Emerson&#x27;s position as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

==Retirement==
On September 2, 2008, it was reported that Emerson would not run in the 2008 federal election, citing the lengthy commute from Vancouver to Ottawa as the reason.
In 2009, he was named co-chair (with Paul Tellier) of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Advisory Committee on the Public Service. He also became a member of the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation.

<doc id="845331" wikidata="Q6116288" url="?curid=845331" title="Jackie Chiles">
<text>Jackie Chiles is a fictional character portrayed by American actor Phil Morris in the NBC sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. A parody of Johnnie Cochran, he appears in the series&#x27; seventh through ninth seasons as Cosmo Kramer&#x27;s lawyer.

==Character==
Chiles is a parody of famed attorney Johnnie Cochran; both are bespectacled, mustachioed, well-dressed, African American lawyers with the same initials and penchants for grandiose vocabulary. According to the diplomas in his office, Chiles attended Dartmouth College and Stanford Law School. Morris also emulates Cochran&#x27;s distinctive enunciation and delivery. After appearing in several episodes during the series&#x27; later years, Chiles, along with many other minor characters from the show&#x27;s past, appeared again in the program&#x27;s finale and was crucial in failing to achieve acquittal of the characters on charges of violating a duty to rescue law. Jackie&#x27;s catchphrase is saying several adjectives in succession for added emphasis, such as &quot;lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!&quot;

Morris also planned to star as Chiles in a spin-off, but the pilot never came to fruition. NBC executives have claimed that a pilot was never discussed with them.

According to Morris, the real-life Cochran told him he enjoyed his appearances as Chiles on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. However, after appearing in character as Chiles in advertisements for the Honda Odyssey and Diet Dr Pepper in 2000, Morris received a cease and desist letter from Cochran&#x27;s law office due to the impact his unflattering mimicry of Cochran might have on his legal career. Following Cochran&#x27;s death, Morris reprised the character again in 2010 for Will Ferrell&#x27;s Funny or Die website and in 2022 for a Snyder&#x27;s of Hanover commercial.

==Appearances==

*Season Seven:
**&quot;The Maestro&quot; — Kramer sneaks a cafe latte into a movie theatre and burns himself while trying to climb over the legs of another patron — a satire of the 1994 lawsuit &quot;Liebeck v. McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants&quot;. Jackie describes having to sneak the coffee in as a violation of Kramer&#x27;s rights as a consumer: &quot;It&#x27;s outrageous, egregious, preposterous.&quot; Kramer uses a balm to treat his burn, causing it to be healed. Furthermore, the coffee company offers a settlement of a lifetime of free coffee at all of their stores throughout North America and Europe. Kramer accepts the offer before the executive had finished speaking and mentioned any money, much to Jackie&#x27;s dismay.
**&quot;The Caddy&quot; — Jackie sues Oh Henry! candy bar heiress Sue Ellen Mischke for allegedly causing Kramer personal injury due to an automobile accident. Kramer distracts Jerry while driving when he sees Mischke walking the streets of New York City wearing only a bra. Chiles describes her actions as &quot;lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!&quot; The lawsuit fails when Kramer, taking the ill advice of his golf caddy, demands she try on the bra to prove it is hers. It fails to fit because she tries donning it over a leotard. Jackie yells at Kramer, &quot;Of course a bra&#x27;s not going to fit on over a leotard. A bra&#x27;s got to fit right up against a person&#x27;s skin... like a glove!&quot; — an obvious parody of the O. J. Simpson murder case.
**&quot;The Friar&#x27;s Club&quot; — Kramer&#x27;s experiment with polyphasic sleep causes him to fall asleep during a make-out session. His Italian girlfriend thinks he has died and gets some friends to dump him in the Hudson River. When he comes to, Kramer accuses her of trying to murder him. She calls her lawyer, Jackie Chiles. Upon hearing that Kramer is involved, however, Jackie declares, &quot;I don&#x27;t want nothing to do with it!&quot;
*Season Eight:
**&quot;The Abstinence&quot; — Kramer&#x27;s face ages prematurely when he turns his apartment into a smoking lounge. Kramer consults with Jackie about filing suit against the tobacco companies for his disfigurement. Jackie describes Kramer&#x27;s face as &quot;sallow, unattractive, disgusting.&quot; When Kramer asks if he has a case, Jackie&#x27;s reply is &quot;Your face is my case.&quot; Jackie and Kramer then meet with a tobacco company lawyer, who alleges that Kramer&#x27;s face gives him a sense of &quot;rugged masculinity.&quot; Jackie replies, &quot;Rugged? The man&#x27;s a goblin. He&#x27;s been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he&#x27;ll be nothing more than a shrunken head.&quot; After the lawyer says she will have an offer to settle out of court the next morning, Jackie tells Kramer, &quot;Jackie&#x27;s cashing in on your wretched disfigurement.&quot; Kramer settles the case without Jackie&#x27;s knowledge for a Marlboro Man style billboard in Times Square featuring his own face. Jackie dubs this &quot;the most public yet of my many humiliations.&quot;
**&quot;The Comeback&quot; — Although Jackie does not appear in the episode, Kramer reveals to Jerry that Chiles has put a restraining order on him, barring him from coming within 200 feet of his office. Kramer goes on to explain that because of this, he could not give Jackie a Christmas gift.
*Season Nine:
**&quot;The Finale&quot; — Jackie represents George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer when they violate the Good Samaritan law. Despite losing the case, he gets some satisfaction in sleeping with Sidra (from &quot;The Implant&quot;), which would have been more satisfying if the jury had not reached a decision so quickly. His last line in the series is the same as Sidra&#x27;s line about her breasts from the aforementioned episode: &quot;And by the way, they&#x27;re real, and they&#x27;re spectacular!&quot;

<text>Llanrumney () is a suburb, community and electoral ward in east Cardiff, Wales.

==History==

The land where modern Llanrumney stands was left to Keynsham Abbey by the Lord of Glamorgan after the Norman Conquest. According to legend, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the final prince of an independent Wales, was interred in a stone coffin by the monks in 1282, on land where Llanrumney Hall would be built centuries later.

After Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries in the sixteenth century, the land passed to the Kemeys family. It remained in their possession until 1951, when it and its grounds were compulsorily purchased by the local authority in order to build the large estates that can be seen there today.

The origins of the name Llanrumney are found in the Welsh word &quot;glan&quot; (&#x27;bank, shore&#x27;) and the Anglicised version of &quot;Rhymni&quot;, the name of the local river. The substitution of &quot;glan&quot; for &quot;llan&quot; (&#x27;church&#x27;) is explained by the fact that in Welsh, &#x27;lan&#x27; is the lenited form of both &quot;glan&quot; and &quot;llan&quot;. Thus phrases such as &#x27;i Lanrhymni&#x27; and &#x27;o Lanrhymni&#x27; (that include the common prepositions &quot;i&quot; &#x27;to&#x27; and &quot;o&quot; &#x27;from&#x27;) could be understood as referring to a place called either &quot;Glanrhymni&quot; or &quot;Llanrhymni&quot;.

The district is predominantly composed of large-scale council estates and is bounded by the wards of Pontprennau &amp; Old St. Mellons to the north, Rumney to the south, Penylan to the southwest, and Pentwyn to the west. The electoral ward of Llanrumney falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth.

The area has a number of shopping precincts, the largest of which is on Countisbury Avenue. Llanrumney Hall, a pub that is reputedly haunted, is one of several local places associated with the pirate Henry Morgan, and is claimed to have been his home from 1635.

Llanrumney Library opened in 2008, replacing an older building.

Cyncoed Ladies F.C. of the Welsh Premier Women&#x27;s Football League have been based in the area since they were formed in 2005.

==Politics==
Llanrumney is in the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South &amp; Penarth and the Senedd constituency of the same name.

Llanrumney is both an electoral ward and a community in Cardiff Council. The ward elects three councillors to Cardiff Council every five years. The community of Llanrumney does not have a community council.

==Transport==

Cardiff Bus services 49/50 serve the area, with buses running frequently to and from the city centre. Routes 65 and 65A link Llanrumney, along with a number of other local suburbs, to the Heath Hospital. The area is currently accessible only via various junctions along Newport Road, which also connects the suburb to the city centre to the south west and St Mellons, the A48(M) and Newport to the north east.

In February 2008, Cardiff County Council approved plans for a new Park and Ride facility to be created on the Rhymney River flood plain adjacent to the nearby Pentwyn Interchange of the A48. In November the same year the site was cleared and access roads created from the nearby A48, signalling the beginning of the project.

In December 2019, as part of the council&#x27;s East Cardiff Industrial Strategy, a plan was announced to ease congestion in east Cardiff by constructing a road and a bridge to link Llanrumney with the Pentwyn Park &amp; Ride site.

==Education==
Llanumney has six primary schools: &quot;Bryn Hafod, Pen-y-Bryn, Glan-yr-Afon, St Cadoc&#x27;s, St Mellon&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Bro Eirwg&quot;, and one secondary school. Llanrumney High School closed in 2013 as part of the Council&#x27;s plans to reorganise secondary education in the city.

===High School closure===
On 20 March 2009 Cardiff Council published a legal statutory notice announcing their intention to close Llanrumney High School by 2012 as part of Cardiff County Council&#x27;s plans to reduce surplus places in schools across the city. Pupils will be merged with those from Rumney High School, which is also to close, and will be housed at a new English medium secondary school built on the Rumney Recreation Ground.

The plans led to the formation by residents from the communities of Llanrumney, Rumney, St Mellons and Trowbridge, Cardiff of the &quot;Rumney Recreation and Eastern Leisure Centre Action Group&quot; (RREEL), seeking to preserve the Rumney Recreation Ground from the proposed development.

A public meeting was held at the Royal British Legion in Llanrumney on 3 February 2009. Cardiff Council Leader Rodney Berman and Deputy Council Leader, Neil McEvoy, and other senior council figures sought to explain the rationale behind the plans.

Also in February the Cardiff Conference of Secondary Heads sent expressing their support for the council&#x27;s plans. The three Llanrumney Labour Councillors Morgan, Parry and Joyce called on the people of Llanrumney to vote no.

Residents of Llanrumney and Rumney voted in a community poll held on 17 February 2009. The question they were asked to vote on at the ballot box was &quot;Do you agree with Cardiff City and County Council that the new school should be built on the Rumney Recreation Ground/Eastern Leisure Centre Site?&quot; - 93% voted against the proposed development on a turnout of 27.6%. In Llanrumney 2,082 people voted no, 170 people voted yes and there were 18 spoilt ballots. The turnout in Llanrumney was 28.7%.

Council Leader Rodney Berman announced in response that the council&#x27;s development plans would proceed and that the community poll result was noted but would not be acted upon. Cardiff Council presented these objections and their proposals to the Welsh Assembly Government on 20 June 2009. Cardiff Council&#x27;s report noted that 1,257 letters of objection to the proposal were received.

<doc id="845334" wikidata="Q5052160" url="?curid=845334" title="Cathays">
<text>Cathays ( ; standardised ; sometimes , &#x27;the constant meadow&#x27;) is a district and community in the centre of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It is an old suburb of Cardiff established in 1875. It is densely populated and contains many Victorian terraced houses. The area falls into the Cathays ward. It is the third most populous community in Cardiff, having a population of 18,002 in 2011.

==Etymology==
The area that is now Cathays was formerly known in Welsh as and in English as Little Heath (to distinguish it from Great Heath).
The name Cathays first appeared in 1699 as &quot;Catt Hays&quot; and originally denoted a tract of common land north-east of Cardiff, now represented by Cathays Park. The second element is a derivative of Old English , meaning &#x27;park or enclosure&#x27;, while the first element has been variously traced to the Welsh word , meaning &#x27;battle&#x27;, and the Old English word , meaning &#x27;wildcat&#x27;.

==History==
By the medieval period farmland outside the old Cardiff Castle, Cathays takes in the northern limit of mediaeval Cardiff — marked by the crossroads of Fairoak Road and Crwys Road.

After John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute, married Charlotte Hickman-Windsor (daughter of Herbert Windsor, 2nd Viscount Windsor) on 12 November 1766, he inherited great further lands, including in Cathays to the north of his existing estate which he had partially developed. He then bought other properties and farms to the north and east, including what became Cathays Park. There he built Cathays House at a cost of £40,000 and at further cost landscaped Cathays Park. After his son took over the title he preferred to live in Cardiff Castle, so demolished the house in 1815, and turned Cathays Park into purely enclosed parkland for grazing.

===Suburb of Cardiff===
Following the 2nd Marquis&#x27; development of Cardiff Docks, and the resultant number of new workers flocking to Cardiff, in 1875 the then rural Cathays became a suburb of Cardiff. At that time, a few streets led off Woodville Road and Cathays Terrace. By 1900 the urbanisation of Cathays was virtually completed. Allensbank and Wedal farms survived briefly. In 1914 they became no more than local place names.

Maindy Barracks opened in 1871. With United States Army troops temporarily stationed in transit in Cardiff during both World War I and World War II, the footpath between Gelligaer Street and New Zealand Road became known as &quot; Road&quot; (from the phrase &quot;Be Undressed and Ready My Angel&quot;), as they came to meet prostitutes.

==Governance==
Cathays does not have a community council.

The electoral ward of Cathays includes both the Cathays and Castle communities and elects four councillors to Cardiff Council.

==Buildings and structures in Cathays==
From 1840, the Taff Vale Railway company developed a railway line through Cathays, where they also developed the Cathays railway works. A major carriage and wagon construction and maintenance facility, it and the associated locomotive depot were taken over and maintained by the Great Western Railway. After nationalisation in 1946, British Railways sold the business and leased the site to the Pullman Company Ltd, where they maintained their carriages until the 1970s. The depot was closed from the late 1960s, and was later redeveloped for buildings now used by Cardiff University. The carriage and wagon works was redeveloped in the early 2000s, and now houses a Lidl store and a student accommodation block. Cathays railway station opened in 1983, adjacent to the students&#x27; union building which encloses the railway tracks.

In 1875, Nazareth House was opened to provide accommodation for orphans and the elderly. A popular local charity, one of its many benefactors was the boxer Jim Driscoll, who, since his burial in Cathays cemetery in 1925, has had his grave tended by the nuns of Nazareth House.

In 1898, John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute sold a large piece of land to Cardiff Council for the building of a new City Hall, imposing strict conditions regarding its purpose and where development could take place. As a result, City Hall was built as far south in the purchased block of land as possible, and the residual area to its north used for civic, cultural and educational purposes only. City Hall cost £129,000 to build, and was completed in 1905 when Cardiff was awarded city status.

The land purchased by the council to the north of the city hall now houses:
*Cardiff University, which moved from Newport Road to Cathays Park in 1909
*National Museum Cardiff, opened in 1927
*Welsh National War Memorial, unveiled in 1928
*Crown Buildings, the Welsh Government&#x27;s main offices in Cardiff; the largest building in Cathays Park
*Temple of Peace and Health (usually known as the Temple of Peace), opened in 1938

Maindy Pool was a clay pit that had gradually filled with water. After the death by drowning of ten children and adults, it was filled in by using it as a rubbish tip. In 1948 the building of Maindy Stadium began on the same site, completed in 1951, which held cycling races in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. When the stadium was closed and replaced with a leisure centre, part of the site became a swimming pool.

Cathays Library is a Carnegie library built in 1906 and refurbished in 2009–10.

Companies House, which holds the registration records of all companies registered in England or Wales, has its headquarters in Cathays.

==Today==

The area of Cathays, given its proximity to most of Cardiff University&#x27;s teaching sites and the University Hospital of Wales, has seen a dramatic fall in owner-occupation, with a high proportion of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) which are let through private landlords and letting agencies to the large student population. 2012 figures available under the Freedom of Information Act show that over 70% of the houses in Cathays were then HMOs. The buy-to-let market has deterred young couples, families and first-time buyers from setting up home in the area.

Cathays High School is an 11–18 mixed comprehensive school that started as a boys&#x27; grammar school in 1903 and became a comprehensive high school in 1973.

Despite the urbanisation of Cathays, there is extensive parkland around the civic centre, including Gorsedd Gardens, Queen Alexandra Gardens, Bute Park and Blackweir.

Of more than 8570 wards in the 2011 census across England and Wales, Cathays ranked 8th lowest in the number of retired people and second lowest in Wales (behind Menai, a ward associated with Bangor University).

==Transport==

The area is served by Cathays railway station in the east, with frequent services south to Cardiff Queen Street and Cardiff Central or north to Merthyr Tydfil and Treherbert via Pontypridd. Cardiff Bus provides many services in the area.
The following bus services run along North Road (in the west), going to the city centre in the reverse direction:
*21 (Rhiwbina-Pantmawr-Whitchurch)
*23 (Whitchurch-Pantmawr-Rhiwbina)
*24 (Whitchurch-Llandaff North-Llandaff-City Centre)
*25 (City Centre)
*27 Capital City Green (Birchgrove-Thornhill)
Likewise, the following services run north along Crwys Road and/or Whitchurch Road (in the east):
*1 &quot;Bay Circle&quot; (Roath-Tremorfa-Splott-Adamsdown-City Centre-Bay-Grangetown-Canton-Fairwater-Llandaff-Gabalfa)
*2 &quot;Bay Circle&quot; (As 1 but reversed)
*8/9/9A (Heath-University Hospital of Wales) or (City Centre-Grangetown-Cardiff Bay)
*35 (Gabalfa) or (City Centre-Cardiff Bay)

The area is close to the busy Gabalfa Interchange, connecting it with the A48 and the M4 motorway.

<doc id="845336" wikidata="Q5002508" url="?curid=845336" title="Butetown">
<text>Butetown (or &quot;The Docks&quot;, ) is a district and community in the south of the city of Cardiff, the capital of Wales. It was originally a model housing estate built in the early 19th century by the 2nd Marquess of Bute, for whose title the area was named. 

Commonly known as &quot;Tiger Bay&quot;, this area became one of the UK&#x27;s first multicultural communities with people from over 50 countries settled here by the outbreak of the First World War, working in the docks and allied industries. Some of the largest communities included the Somalis, Yemenis and Greeks, whose influence still lives on today. A Greek Orthodox church still stands at the top of Bute Street. 

It is known as one of the &quot;five towns of Cardiff&quot;, the others being Crockherbtown, Grangetown, Newtown and Temperance Town. 

The population of the ward and community taken at the 2011 census was 10,125. It is estimated that the Butetown&#x27;s population increased to 14,094 by 2019.

== History ==
By 1911 the proportion of Cardiff&#x27;s population that was black or Asian was second in the UK to London, though mainly concentrated in the dock areas such as Tiger Bay. The district was one of the epicentres of the 1919 South Wales race riots, with eyewitnesses reporting six deaths instead of the official accounts of three, and with nearly all arrests made by the Cardiff police being of the local ethnic minority population instead of the white soldiers who had instigated the riots.

During World War II, local authorities attempted to ban Black American G.I.s from drinking in the city&#x27;s pubs; however, pub staff refused to enforce the ban.

In the 1960s, most of the original housing was demolished including the historic Loudoun Square, the original heart of Butetown. In its place was a typical 1960s housing estate of low-rise courts and alleys, and two high-rise blocks of flats.

In the 1980s, the new Atlantic Wharf development was built on the reclaimed West Bute Dock, and has involved the construction of some 1,300 new houses. Together with the developments in the Inner Harbour and Roath Basin, it was hoped this would spur redevelopment and employment in Butetown, but it seems not to have. The divide between the wealthy Cardiff Bay and the poor Tiger Bay seems as wide as ever, although some of the surviving areas of historic Butetown are becoming prime office and retail locations. With the new Century Wharf development to the west on the banks of the Taff, the housing estate is becoming a little &#x27;boxed in&#x27;, increasing feelings of exclusion. Over the next few decades, the 1960s housing will require renewal and it is hoped that new development will be more suited to the urban context of the area and will provide a better mix of private and public housing to help fully integrate the community with the rest of the city.

A three-year £13m project to redevelop a shopping parade, community hub, health centre and homes in Butetown began in 2010. The Loudoun Square development will include environmental aspects such as harvesting rain water. The project is a collaboration between Cardiff Community Housing Association (CCHA), Cardiff Council and Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. The facilities and 62 new homes will follow four years of consultation with local residents. In 2022 a well-known mural of Maimuna Yoncana on St James Street which celebrated Cardiff’s ethnic diversity was painted over with a McDonald&#x27;s advert.

== Demographics ==
The 2011 census included the following demographic information:

*Overall population: 10,125
*White: 65.7%
*Black: 11.3%
*Asian: 9.7%
*Mixed Ethnicity: 5.7%
*Other Ethnic Groups: 7.7%

People identifying themselves as Welsh: 42.8%

==Welsh language==
The growth of the docks in the mid 19th century attracted a significant Welsh-speaking community to the area. To serve this community three Welsh-language chapels were opened: Bethania, Loudon Square (Calvinistic Methodist; opened 1853, closed 1937); Mount Stuart (Congregationalist; opened 1858, relocated to Pomeroy Street in 1912); and Siloam, Mount Stuart Square (Baptist; opened 1860, moved to Grangetown in 1902). A Welsh-speaking Anglican church also opened in the area in 1856 (All Saints on Tyndall Street; Welsh language services moved elsewhere in 1870). One of the members of Butetown’s Welsh-speaking community was Evan Rees (Dyfed), a worker in the Bute Docks in the 1870s and a future Archdruid of Wales.

The 1891 census showed that 15% of Butetown’s population could speak Welsh, significantly higher than the Cardiff average of 10.7%. Some parts had a particularly high percentage, such as the Loudon Square/James Street area (28%). During the 20th century, however, the percentage declined, although Welsh-speakers remained a recognised part of the local community.

In the 2011 census it was recorded that 928 or 9.6% of Butetown residents (over 3 years old) could speak Welsh. This was a significant increase on the figures for the 2001 census, which were 356 and 8.3%.

==Transport==

The area is served by Cardiff Bay railway station with shuttle services every 12 minutes to Cardiff Queen Street.
Cardiff Bus operates the 11 service to Pengam Green via Cardiff City Centre, Splott and Tremorfa and the 35 service to Gabalfa via Central Stn and Cathays. It also on the 1/2 Bay Circle route connecting the area with Grangetown, Canton, Fairwater, Llandaff, Gabalfa, Heath, Cathays, Roath, Tremorfa, Splott and the City Centre. Butetown also enjoys the incorporating Cardiff Bay, thus benefiting from its public transport opportunities such as the Baycar bus route.

Bute Street and Lloyd George Avenue, running parallel, link the area to the city centre. Also, the A4232 links it to Culverhouse Cross and the M4 J33 Cardiff West to the west and to Adamsdown in the east.

==Government==

Butetown is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. The electoral ward of Butetown is located in the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth. It is bounded by the wards of Cathays and Adamsdown to the north; Splott to the northeast; Severn estuary to the southeast; and Grangetown to the west.

Since the 2022 Welsh local elections, the Butetown ward has been represented by Labour councillors Saeed Ebrahim, Helen Gunter and Margaret Lewis.

The name of the area invokes Saint Fagan, according to William of Malmesbury a second-century missionary to Wales but for whom there is no reliable historical evidence.

In 1648, the Battle of St Fagans took place close by.

==Description==
To the south lies the village of Michaelston-super-Ely, and to the east the suburb of Fairwater. The community includes Rhydlafar to the north. St Fagans lies on the River Ely, and previously had a railway station on the South Wales Main Line, and currently there is a level crossing.

The village is home to St Fagans National History Museum (formerly called the &quot;Welsh Folk Museum&quot; and the &quot;Museum of Welsh Life&quot;) which includes St Fagans Castle and gardens. St Mary&#x27;s Church in the village dates from the 12th century, with an 18th-century tower. St Fagans Old Rectory is another important Grade II* listed building nearby.

St Fagans is home to St Fagans Cricket Club.

In 2017 construction started on a new Cardiff suburb of 7,000 houses, named Plasdwr, on countryside between St Fagans, Fairwater and Radyr.

==Local government==

St Fagans elects a community council of up to nine community councillors. The council is funded by a precept on local council tax bills and supports a number of local facilities and services. Elections are held every five years.

===2017 Community Council Election===
Six candidates stood for nine seats during the 2017 Cardiff Council election. All candidates were therefore elected unopposed, with three other seats filled through councillors being co-opted by members of the community council.

===2022 Community Council Election===
The next election is due to be held in May 2022.

<text>Frederick Louis MacNeice (12 September 1907 – 3 September 1963) was an Irish poet, playwright and producer for the BBC. His poetry, which frequently explores themes of introspection, empiricism, and belonging, is considered to be among the greatest of twentieth century literature. Despite being renowned as a member of the Auden Group, he was also an independently successful (albeit occasionally overlooked) poet with an influential body of work, which is replete with themes ranging from faith to mortality. His body of work was appreciated by the public during his lifetime, due in part to his relaxed but socially and emotionally aware style. Never as overtly or simplistically political as some of his contemporaries, he expressed a humane opposition to totalitarianism as well as an acute awareness of his roots.

==Life==
===Ireland, 1907–1917===

Louis MacNeice (known as Freddie until his teens, when he adopted his middle name) was born in Belfast, the youngest son of Rev. John Frederick and Elizabeth Margaret (&quot;Lily&quot;) MacNeice. Both were originally from the west of Ireland. MacNeice&#x27;s father, an Anglican clergyman, would go on to become a bishop in the Church of Ireland and his mother Elizabeth née Cleshan, from Ballymaconry, Connemara, County Galway, had been a schoolmistress. The family moved to Carrickfergus, County Antrim, soon after MacNeice&#x27;s birth.

When MacNeice was six, his mother was admitted to a Dublin nursing home suffering from severe clinical depression and he did not see her again. She survived uterine cancer but died of tuberculosis in December 1914. MacNeice later described the cause of his mother&#x27;s death as &quot;obscure&quot;, and blamed his mother&#x27;s cancer on his own difficult birth. His brother William, who had Down&#x27;s syndrome, had been sent to live in an institution in Scotland during his mother&#x27;s terminal illness. In 1917, his father remarried to Georgina Greer and MacNeice&#x27;s sister Elizabeth was sent to board at a preparatory school at Sherborne, England. MacNeice joined her at Sherborne Preparatory School later in the year.

===School, 1917–1926===
MacNeice was generally happy at Sherborne, which gave an education concentrating on the Classics (Greek and Latin) and literature (including the memorising of poetry). He was an enthusiastic sportsman, something which continued when he moved to Marlborough College in 1921, having won a classical scholarship. Marlborough was a less happy place, with a hierarchical and sometimes cruel social structure, but MacNeice&#x27;s interest in ancient literature and civilisation deepened and expanded to include Egyptian and Norse mythology. In 1922, he was invited to join Marlborough&#x27;s secret &#x27;Society of Amici&#x27; where he was a contemporary of John Betjeman and Anthony Blunt, forming a lifelong friendship with the latter. He also wrote poetry and essays for the school magazines. By the end of his time at the school, MacNeice was sharing a study with Blunt and also sharing his aesthetic tastes, though not his sexual ones; Blunt said MacNeice was &quot;totally, irredeemably heterosexual&quot;. In November 1925, MacNeice was awarded a postmastership to Merton College, Oxford, and he left Marlborough in the summer of the following year. He left behind his birth name of Frederick, his accent and his father&#x27;s faith, although he never lost a sense of his Irishness; (the BBC radio premiere of MacNeice&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; in January 1946, was preceded by the poet&#x27;s ten-minute introduction in his distinctive Ulster accent.)

===Oxford, 1926–1930===
It was during his first year as a student at Oxford that MacNeice first met W. H. Auden, who had gained a reputation as the university&#x27;s foremost poet during the preceding year. Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis were already part of Auden&#x27;s circle, but MacNeice&#x27;s closest Oxford friends were John Hilton, Christopher Holme and Graham Shepard, who had been with him at Marlborough. MacNeice threw himself into the aesthetic culture, publishing poetry in literary magazines &quot;The Cherwell&quot; and &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;, organising candle-lit readings of Shelley and Marlowe, and visiting Paris with Hilton. Auden would become a lifelong friend who inspired MacNeice to take up poetry seriously.

In 1928 he was introduced to the Classics don John Beazley and his stepdaughter Mary Ezra. A year later he thought to soften the news that he had been arrested for drunkenness by telegraphing his father to say he was engaged to be married to Mary. John MacNeice (by now Archdeacon of Connor, and a Bishop a few years later) was horrified to discover his son was engaged to a Jew, while Ezra&#x27;s family demanded assurances that Louis&#x27;s brother&#x27;s Down&#x27;s syndrome was not hereditary. Amidst this turmoil MacNeice published four poems in &quot;Oxford Poetry, 1929&quot; and his first undergraduate collection &quot;Blind Fireworks&quot; (1929). Published by Gollancz, the volume was dedicated to &quot;Giovanna&quot; (Mary&#x27;s full name was Giovanna Marie Thérèse Babette). In 1930 the couple were married at Oxford Register Office, neither set of parents attending the ceremony. He was awarded a first-class degree in &quot;literae humaniores&quot;, and had already gained an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University of Birmingham.

===Birmingham, 1930–1936===
The newlyweds were found lodgings in Birmingham by E. R. Dodds (a Professor of Greek and MacNeice&#x27;s future literary executor) and his wife Bet. Bet was a lecturer in the Department of English. The MacNeices lived in a former coachman&#x27;s cottage in the grounds of a house in Selly Park belonging to another professor, Philip Sargant Florence. Birmingham was a very different university (and city) from Oxford, MacNeice was not a natural lecturer, and he found it difficult to write poetry. He turned instead to a semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Roundabout Way&quot;, which was published in 1932 under the name of Louis Malone as he feared a novel by an academic would not be favourably reviewed. He felt that married life was not helping his poetry: &quot;To write poems expressing doubt or melancholy, an anarchist conception of freedom or nostalgia for the open spaces (and these were the things that I wanted to express), seemed disloyal to Mariette. Instead I was disloyal to myself, wrote a novel which purported to be an idyll of domestic felicity. As we predicted, the novel was not well received.&quot;

The local Classical Association included George Augustus Auden, Professor of Public Health and father of W. H. Auden, and by 1932 MacNeice and Auden&#x27;s Oxford acquaintance had turned into a close friendship. Auden knew many Marxists, and Blunt had also become a communist by this time, but MacNeice, although sympathetic to the left, was always sceptical of easy answers and &quot;the armchair reformist&quot;. &quot;The Strings are False&quot; (written at the time of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) describes his wish for a change in society and even revolution, but also his intellectual opposition to Marxism and especially the communism embraced by many of his friends.

MacNeice started to write poetry again, and in January 1933 he and Auden led the first edition of Geoffrey Grigson&#x27;s magazine &quot;New Verse&quot;. MacNeice also started sending poems to T. S. Eliot at around this time, and although Eliot did not feel that they merited Faber and Faber publishing a volume of poems, several were published in Eliot&#x27;s journal &quot;The Criterion&quot;. On 15 May 1934, Louis and Mary&#x27;s son Daniel John MacNeice was born. In September of that year, MacNeice travelled to Dublin with Dodds, who had republican sympathies, and met William Butler Yeats. Unsuccessful attempts at playwriting and another novel were followed in September 1935 by &quot;Poems&quot;, the first of his collections for Faber and Faber, who would remain his publishers. This helped establish MacNeice as one of the new poets of the 1930s.

In November, Mary left MacNeice and their infant son for a Russian-American graduate student called Charles Katzmann who had been staying with the family. MacNeice engaged a nurse to look after Dan, and his sister and stepmother also helped on occasion. In early 1936, Blunt and MacNeice visited Spain, shortly after the election of the Popular Front government. Auden and MacNeice travelled to Iceland in the summer of that year, which resulted in &quot;Letters from Iceland&quot;, a collection of poems, letters (some in verse) and essays. In October, MacNeice left Birmingham for a lecturing post in the Department of Greek at Bedford College for Women, part of the University of London.

===London, 1936–1940===
MacNeice was featured in two high-profile collections of modernist poetry of 1936. The &quot;Faber Book of Modern Verse&quot;, edited by young writer and critic Michael Roberts, printing MacNeice&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;An Eclogue for Christmas&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Perseus&quot;, &quot;The Creditor&quot; and &quot;Snow&quot; towards the end of the roughly chronological book. In the book, MacNeice is set in amongst others of the new Auden Group, presenting a version of modernism in which Eliot is the star. MacNeice and his group were also featured in &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892–1935&quot;, edited by Yeats. This collection generally excluded American poets and was less well received critically, but instantaneously became a best-seller.

MacNeice moved into Geoffrey Grigson&#x27;s former flat in Hampstead with Daniel and his nurse. His translation of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was published in late 1936, and produced by the Group Theatre. Shortly afterwards his divorce from Mary was finalised. They continued to write frequent affectionate letters to one another, although Mary married Katzmann shortly after the divorce.

MacNeice started an affair with Nancy Coldstream. Nancy was, like her husband Bill, a painter and a friend of Auden who had introduced the couple to MacNeice while they were in Birmingham. MacNeice and Nancy visited the Hebrides in 1937, which resulted in a book of prose and verse written by MacNeice with illustrations by Nancy, &quot;I Crossed the Minch&quot;. Nancy had painted a portrait of MacNeice.

August 1937 saw the appearance of &quot;Letters from Iceland&quot; (which had been finished by the two authors in MacNeice&#x27;s London home the previous year), and towards the end of the year a play called &quot;Out of the Picture&quot; was published and produced by the Group Theatre. Music was written for the production by Benjamin Britten, as he had done previously for &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. In 1938, Faber and Faber published a second collection of poems, &quot;The Earth Compels&quot;, the Oxford University Press published &quot;Modern Poetry&quot;, and Nancy once again contributed illustrations to a book about London Zoo, called simply &quot;Zoo&quot;.

As the year – and his relationship with Nancy – drew to a close, he started work on &quot;Autumn Journal&quot;. By Christmas, Nancy was in love with Stephen Spender&#x27;s brother Michael, whom she was later to marry, and at the end of the year MacNeice visited Barcelona shortly before the city fell to Franco. The poem was finished by February 1939, and published in May. It is widely viewed as MacNeice&#x27;s masterpiece, recording his feelings as the Spanish Civil War raged and the United Kingdom headed towards war with Germany, as well as his personal concerns and reflections over the past decade.

During the Easter holiday that year, MacNeice made a brief lecture tour of various American universities, also meeting Mary and Charles Katzmann and giving a reading with Auden and Christopher Isherwood in New York attended by John Berryman, and at which Auden met Chester Kallman for the first time. MacNeice also met the writer Eleanor Clark in New York, and arranged to spend the next academic year on sabbatical so that he could be with her. A lectureship at Cornell University was organised, and in December 1939 MacNeice sailed for America, leaving his son in Ireland. Cornell proved a success but the relationship with Eleanor did not, and MacNeice was back in London by the end of 1940. Faber and Faber published &quot;Selected Poems&quot; in March 1940, which contained 20 poems drawn from &quot;Poems 1935&quot;, &quot;The Earth Compels&quot; and &quot;Autumn Journal&quot;. It went through six impressions by 1945 and is considered his best known work. MacNeice worked as a freelance journalist (he had resigned from his lecturing position at Bedford College while in America) and was awaiting the publication of &quot;Plant and Phantom&quot;, which was dedicated to Clark (the previous year, the Cuala Press had published &quot;The Last Ditch&quot;, a limited edition containing some poems that would appear in the new volume). In early 1941, MacNeice was employed by the BBC.

===War and after, 1941–1963===
MacNeice&#x27;s work for the BBC initially involved writing and producing radio programmes intended to build support for the US, and later Russia – cultural programmes emphasising links between the countries rather than outright propaganda. A critical work on W. B. Yeats (on which he had been working since the poet&#x27;s death in 1939) was published early in 1941, as were &quot;Plant and Phantom&quot; and &quot;Poems 1925–1940&quot; (an American anthology). At the end of the year, MacNeice started a relationship with Hedli Anderson and they were married in July 1942, three months after the death of his father. Brigid Corinna MacNeice (known by her second name like her parents, or as &quot;Bimba&quot;) was born a year later. By the end of the war MacNeice had written well over sixty scripts for the BBC and a further collection of poems, &quot;Springboard&quot;. The radio play &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;, produced in 1942 and later published as a book, featured music by William Walton, conducted by Sir Adrian Boult, and starred Laurence Olivier. 1943&#x27;s &quot;He Had a Date&quot; (loosely based on the life and death of MacNeice&#x27;s friend Graham Shepard but also semi-autobiographical) was also published, as was &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; (1946, again with music by Britten). Dylan Thomas acted in some of MacNeice&#x27;s plays during this period, and the two poets, both heavy drinkers, also became social companions. MacNeice narrated (and wrote poems for) the 1945 film Painted Boats.

In 1947, the BBC sent MacNeice to report on Indian independence and partition, and he continued to produce plays for the corporation, including a six-part radio adaptation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; in 1949. 1948&#x27;s collection of poems, &quot;Holes in the Sky&quot;, met with a less favourable reception than previous books. In 1950 he was given eighteen months&#x27; leave to become Director of the British Institute in Athens, run by the British Council. Patrick Leigh Fermor had previously been Deputy Director of the Institute, and he and his future wife, the Honourable Joan Elizabeth Rayner (née Eyres Monsell), became close friends of the MacNeices. &quot;Ten Burnt Offerings&quot;, poems written in Greece, were broadcast by the BBC in 1951 and published the following year. The family returned to England in August 1951, and Dan (who had been at an English boarding school) left for America in early 1952 to stay with his mother, to avoid national service. Dan would return to England in 1953, but went to live permanently with his mother after a legal battle with MacNeice.

In 1953, MacNeice wrote &quot;Autumn Sequel&quot;, a long autobiographical poem in terza rima, which critics compared unfavourably with &quot;Autumn Journal&quot;. The death of Dylan Thomas came partway through the writing of the poem, and MacNeice involved himself in memorials for the poet and attempts to raise money for his family. 1953 and 1954 brought lecture and performance tours of the USA (husband and wife would present an evening of song, monologue and poetry readings), and meetings with John Berryman (on the returning boat in 1953, and later in London) and Eleanor Clark (by now married to Robert Penn Warren). MacNeice travelled to Egypt in 1955 and Ghana in 1956 on lengthy assignments for the BBC. Another poorly received collection of poems, &quot;Visitations&quot;, was published in 1957, and the MacNeices bought a holiday home on the Isle of Wight from J. B. Priestley (an acquaintance since MacNeice&#x27;s arrival in London twenty years earlier). However, the marriage was starting to become strained. MacNeice was drinking increasingly heavily, and having more or less serious affairs with other women. At this time MacNeice became increasingly independent of spirit, spending time with other writers, including Dominic Behan with whom he regularly drank to oblivion; the two men spent a particularly drunken night in the home of Cecil Woodham-Smith during a curious meeting in Ireland whilst Behan was working on assignment as a writer for &quot;Life&quot; magazine and MacNeice on assignment with the BBC. During the trip, which allegedly lasted some weeks, neither writer managed successfully to file their copy.

MacNeice was awarded the CBE in the 1958 New Year&#x27;s Honours list. A South African trip in 1959 was followed by the start of his final relationship, with the actress Mary Wimbush, who had performed in his plays since the forties. Hedli asked MacNeice to leave the family home in late 1960. In early 1961, &quot;Solstices&quot; was published, and in the middle of the year MacNeice became a half-time employee at the BBC, leaving him six months a year to work on his own projects. By this time he was &quot;living on alcohol&quot;, and eating very little, but still writing (including a commissioned work on astrology, which he viewed as &quot;hack-work&quot;). In August 1963 he went caving in Yorkshire to gather sound effects for his final radio play, &quot;Persons from Porlock&quot;. Caught in a storm on the moors, he did not change out of his wet clothes until he was home in Hertfordshire. Bronchitis evolved into viral pneumonia, and he was admitted to hospital in London on 27 August, dying there on 3 September, aged 55.

His ashes were buried in Carrowdore churchyard in County Down, with his mother and maternal grandfather. His final book of poems, &quot;The Burning Perch&quot;, was published a few days after his funeral – Auden, who gave a reading at MacNeice&#x27;s memorial service, described the poems of his last two years as &quot;among his very best&quot;.

==Influence==
MacNeice wrote in the introduction to his &quot;Autumn Journal&quot;, &quot;Poetry in my opinion must be honest before anything else and I refuse to be &#x27;objective&#x27; or clear-cut at the cost of honesty.&quot; He has inspired many poets since his death, particularly those from Northern Ireland such as Paul Muldoon and Michael Longley. There has been a movement to reclaim him as an Irish writer rather than a satellite of Auden. Longley has edited two selections of his work, and Muldoon gives more space to MacNeice than to any other author in his &quot;Faber Book of Contemporary Irish Poetry&quot;, which covers the period from the death of W. B. Yeats until 1986. Muldoon and Derek Mahon have both written elegies for MacNeice, Mahon&#x27;s coming after a pilgrimage to the poet&#x27;s grave in the company of Longley and Seamus Heaney in 1965. At the time of MacNeice&#x27;s death, John Berryman described him as &quot;one of my best friends&quot;, and wrote an elegy in &quot;Dream Song #267&quot;.

==Archive==
Louis MacNeice&#x27;s archive was established at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 1964, a year after MacNeice&#x27;s death. The collection, largely coming from MacNeice&#x27;s sister Elizabeth Nicholson, includes manuscripts of poetic and dramatic works, a large number of books, correspondence, and books from MacNeice&#x27;s library.

<text>A slide calculator, also known as an Addiator after the best-known brand, is a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, once made by Addiator Gesellschaft of Berlin, Germany. Variants of it were manufactured from 1920 until 1982. The devices were made obsolete by the electronic calculator.

== Design ==

The Addiator is composed of sheet-metal sliders inside a metal envelope, manipulated by a stylus, with an innovative carry mechanism, doing &quot;subtract ten, carry one&quot; with a simple stylus movement. Some types of Addiators can also handle negative numbers (with a complementary bottom window or by providing a subtraction mode on the back side of the device).

The Addiator also handles non-decimal measurements, like feet and inches, or pre-decimalization pounds, shillings, and pence. Addition and subtraction require different &quot;screens&quot;, handled by turning the instrument over, or flipping a front panel, or, later, by extended sliders and an extra lower panel. Although not always advertised (e.g., the Magic Brain Calculator mentions &quot;add, subtract, multiply&quot; on its front plate), procedures exist for multiplication (by repeated addition or by individual digit multiplications) and division (e.g., by repeated subtraction, or use of additions combined with complementary numbers).

More expensive versions have a built-in slide rule on the back.

== History ==

Sometime between 1666 and 1675, French polymath Claude Perrault invented the first slide calculator, called &quot;Abaque rhabdologique&quot; (a rabdological abacus), when he needed to do a lot of calculations while working as an architect.

About three decades later, around 1700 or shortly after, French businessman and amateur mathematician César Caze simplified Perrault&#x27;s design and adapted it to counting money, getting a privilege (patent) in 1711. However, neither of these devices implemented a carry mechanism.

In 1845, German musician and amateur mechanic Heinrich Kummer, who was living in St. Petersburg, saw a mechanical calculator of a different design made by Hayyim Selig Slonimski, and in the next year borrowed the idea of its carry mechanism to greatly improve Caze&#x27;s device, leading to the modern variant of the slide calculator.

===Addiator===
In 1889, Louis-Joseph Troncet successfully commercialized the Addiator, which became one of the most popular calculators of its kind, and the name is often used to refer to the type generally.

Addiators appeared in newspaper advertisements as early as 1921, listed at a price of in the &quot;Daily Record&quot; of Scotland. As of 1968, Addiators were advertised in American newspapers starting at $3.98 each .

<text>KHII-TV (channel 9) is a television station in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, serving the Hawaiian Islands as an affiliate of MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside dual Fox affiliate/CW owned-and-operated station KHON-TV (channel 2). The two stations share studios at the Haiwaiki Tower in downtown Honolulu; KHII&#x27;s main transmitter is located in Akupu, Hawaii.

==History==
===Early history===
KHII signed on the air on February 7, 1988, as KFVE, broadcasting on channel 5, as the final VHF station in the market. Originally, KFVE focused on low-budget programming such as &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; repeats. Later under the moniker &quot;Hawaii is Watching us Grow&quot;, it focused on movies and syndicated fare, and by 1990 acquired programs from KMGT (channel 26, now KAAH) before its format switch to religious programming. As a small-time independent station, it had to rely on low-budget programming and Japanese television dramas (most of which were later carried on independent station KIKU, channel 20) through much of its early existence. That all changed in 1993 when another local station, KHNL (then a Fox affiliate owned by the Providence Journal Company), took over management of KFVE through a local marketing agreement (LMA). KFVE then merged its operations into KHNL&#x27;s facility. It was the first such local market sharing organization in the country. After KHNL took over oversight of the station in the mid-1990s, coverage of University of Hawaii athletics moved over to KFVE, which rebranded as &quot;The Home Team&quot;.

===UPN and WB affiliations===
On January 16, 1995, KFVE became a charter affiliate of UPN under the brand name &quot;K-5 UPN Hawaii&quot;. On December 28, 1998, the station began carrying programming from The WB as a secondary affiliation. Previously, The WB was carried throughout Hawaii on KWHE (channel 14). KFVE was acquired outright by Raycom Media on December 31, 1999. Raycom had purchased KHNL and the LMA with KFVE from Belo Corporation two months earlier, but acquired KFVE&#x27;s license as well after the FCC began permitting duopolies between television stations.

On September 2, 2002, KFVE dropped its affiliation with UPN and became a primary WB affiliate. The station rebranded itself as &quot;K-5, The Home Team: Hawaii&#x27;s WB&quot;, with the &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s WB&quot; branding being used primarily during promotional advertisements for WB programming. In the Honolulu market, UPN programming moved to KHON-TV (channel 2) and KGMB (then on channel 9), which both carried secondary affiliations with the network from September 2002 to October 2004.

===MyNetworkTV affiliation===
On March 7, 2006, Raycom Media announced that KFVE would affiliate with MyNetworkTV as part of a group deal involving many of Raycom-owned affiliates of The WB and UPN (whose consolidation and shutdowns the following September resulted in the creation of The CW Television Network, which would affiliate in Hawaii with a digital subchannel of KHON-TV). KFVE officially joined MyNetworkTV on September 5, 2006, and did not air The WB&#x27;s final two weeks of prime-time programming (though it continued to air WB daytime and Saturday morning programming until the end of the network&#x27;s existence).

On January 15, 2009, DirecTV transferred KFVE from analog to its digital and high definition signals due to the analog shutdown. The HD feed of KFVE was pulled off DirecTV on January 16 for unknown reasons. A standard definition digital feed of the station was restored on the satellite provider on January 17. On February 29, 2012, KFVE&#x27;s HD feed was restored on DirecTV.

On August 18, 2009, Raycom Media announced that it would enter into a shared services agreement with MCG Capital Corporation (owner of CBS affiliate KGMB), in which the operations of that station, KFVE and KHNL would be combined. The SSA also moved KFVE and its programming from virtual channel 5 to channel 9 under MCG ownership, while KGMB moved from 9 to 5 and fell under Raycom&#x27;s ownership. The FCC only recognizes ownership of facility IDs and not station call signs or intellectual property, allowing MCG Capital to gain ownership of KFVE and Raycom ownership of KGMB during the swap. The overall viewership of KFVE, while on channel 5, fell outside the criteria (which restricts ownership of two stations in the same market to one of the four highest-rated stations and one not among the top four) that would have otherwise barred a duopoly between KHNL and KGMB if facility IDs were traded as well. The channel swap took effect with the SSA on October 26, 2009, as KFVE moved from 5 to 9 and changed its on-air branding from &quot;K-5&quot; to simply &quot;KFVE&quot; .As a result, KFVE now operates under KGMB&#x27;s license. The two stations also swapped outer-island satellites. On November 20, 2013, MCG Capital filed to sell KFVE and its satellites to American Spirit Media, a company owned by Thomas B. Henson and a shared services duopoly partner with Raycom in several other markets, for $22 million.

===Sale to Nexstar===
On June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom&#x27;s 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including KHNL and KGMB, and Gray&#x27;s 93 television stations) under the former&#x27;s corporate umbrella in a cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion. Because Raycom operated three stations in the Honolulu market, the companies were required to sell either KHNL, KGMB or KFVE to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules.

On November 1, 2018, Irving, Texas–based Nexstar Media Group—which has owned Fox affiliate KHON-TV since January 2017—announced that it would acquire KFVE and the licenses of satellites KGMD-TV and KGMV from American Spirit Media for $6.5 million. Nexstar concurrently assumed the station&#x27;s operations through a time brokerage agreement that took effect the day the transaction paperwork was filed with the FCC, under which Raycom forwarded the rights to certain managerial services involving KFVE – not counting certain other services to which Raycom would retain stewardship under the TBA – on a transitional basis. Under the deal, Nexstar also intends to integrate KFVE&#x27;s operations into KHON&#x27;s studio facilities at the Haiwaiki Tower on Piikoi and Waimanu Streets. However, Raycom will retain rights to the KFVE intellectual unit (call letters, syndicated and local programming), which will be shifted to a digital subchannel of either KHNL or KGMB as will KFVE-DT2&#x27;s Bounce TV affiliation (which will be moved to KGMB-DT4); the KFVE calls will also be retained by Raycom for branding continuity. As such, Nexstar will likely assign new call letters to the channel 9 license as well as acquire programming to replace that being maintained by Raycom post-acquisition (which may include shifting the programming on KHON&#x27;s CW-affiliated DT2 feed to the KFVE license, and/or the retention of the MyNetworkTV affiliation, which Raycom did not include in the KFVE intellectual property transaction.)

The sale of KFVE to Nexstar was approved by the FCC on December 17; the Gray-Raycom merger was approved three days later.

On January 17, 2019, Nexstar announced that it would relaunch the station as KHII-TV. The station would retain its MyNetworkTV affiliation and plans to continue its focus on bringing local programming to Hawaii. The rebranding and call sign change took place concurrent with the sale&#x27;s completion on January 28. At the same time, KFVE&#x27;s intellectual unit and syndicated programming, along with its Hawaii-centric specials, moved to the second digital subchannel of KHNL-DT2 (channel 13.2), and changed its cable channel position from Charter Spectrum 5/1005 to 22/1022. The HD feed of &quot;K5&quot; was temporarily exclusive to cable, because ever since its inception, KHNL-DT2 had been broadcast in 480i 4:3 standard definition. An equipment upgrade in early 2021 allowed for an upgrade of the subchannel to 720p 16:9 high definition; however, the KSIX-DT2 and KOGG-DT2 simulcasts of &quot;K5&quot; continue to be aired in standard definition.

==Programming==
KHII clears all MyNetworkTV programming, except for the occasional preemption in order to broadcast local sports or other special events. As the station (as KFVE) once did with UPN and WB programs, KHII will delay MyNetworkTV programming until the weekend in order to broadcast these sporting events. Because MyNetworkTV airs ten hours of programming per week, syndicated programming makes up a vast portion of KHII&#x27;s weekday schedule, especially during the daytime. Until the 2009 channel swap, KFVE, unlike most affiliates, only used the MyNetworkTV logo to promote its programming in a similar way to WXSP-CA in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which uses the branding &quot;The X&quot; and a &quot;MyNetworkTV WXSP&quot; logo. KFVE&#x27;s local logo was used at all other times such as when promoting sitcom repeats or news.

Movies are also a regular part of its weekend afternoon schedule; late night and early morning timeslots on KHII primarily feature infomercials. KHII was also home to the most complete and comprehensive college sports package in the country as the station showcased more than 100 University of Hawaii sports events annually. Sports covered on KFVE included football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, baseball, softball, and women&#x27;s soccer. KFVE (since 1994) and sister station KHNL (from 1984 to 1993) had been the home of University of Hawaii sports in the islands for over two decades. KFVE broadcast home games in high definition beginning in August 2009 on pay-per-view, with Wahine Volleyball, Warrior Basketball and Warrior Football televised in HD. Events that were not aired on pay-per-view were broadcast in standard definition.

KFVE broadcast its last University of Hawaii sports event on May 15, 2011, with a baseball game against the San Jose State Spartans. In August 2011, Oceanic Cable began carrying University of Hawaii sports evening on a new regional sports network OC Sports Channel (which is carried on channel 12). In January 2012, KFVE broadcast two Pac-West Conference basketball games in HD, featuring Hawaii Pacific University as the home team in both contests.

KHII currently airs the MyNetworkTV prime time programming block from 8 to 10 p.m., instead of the usual scheduled time period of 7 to 9 p.m., which is reserved for local and syndicated programming (KHII airs a local newscast produced by KHON during the 7 p.m. hour).

In January 2015, KFVE added Korean dramas to its weekend lineup, airing Sundays from 2 to 5 p.m. They became the second station in Hawaii to feature Korean programming, after KBFD.

===Newscasts===
====KFVE====

On April 17, 1995, KHNL began producing a prime time newscast at 9 p.m. that was simulcast on KFVE; this newscast, by then a standalone program as KHNL dropped its 9 p.m. newscast after switching from Fox to NBC, was dropped on August 3, 1997. On October 18, 2004, KHNL began producing a prime time newscast for KFVE once more, this time airing exclusively on the station; KFVE was the only station in the market to carry its late evening newscast at 9 p.m. as Fox affiliate KHON-TV airs its late newscast at 10 p.m. However, KHON-TV added a 9 p.m. newscast in 2014. KHNL&#x27;s production of KFVE&#x27;s newscasts expanded on January 7, 2008, when the then-channel 5 began carrying an early evening newscast at 6:30 p.m. Later that year on December 22, KHNL began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; KFVE&#x27;s newscasts were included in the upgrade.

The shared services agreement resulted in the termination of all but four members of KHNL&#x27;s on-air staff and all of the technicians for KHNL&#x27;s morning show when its newsroom merged with KGMB and the two began simulcasting newscasts on October 26, 2009. KFVE maintains its 6:30 and 9 p.m. newscasts that it had prior to the formation of the SSA between KHNL and KGMB; however, the SSA resulted in the addition of an hour-long weekday morning newscast from 8 to 9 a.m., which airs in that timeslot and for only one hour due to KGMB continuing to run an hour-long extension of &quot;Hawaii News Now: Sunrise&quot; from 7 to 8 a.m. There are no simulcasts of any newscasts from either of its two major network sister stations.

====KHII-TV====

As part of the switch to KHII, on January 28, 2019, the station began airing a simulcast of KHON&#x27;s morning newscast &quot;Wake Up 2day&quot; and an hour-long weeknight 7 p.m. newscast produced by KHON. Five days later, on February 2, KHII began simulcasting KHON&#x27;s 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. weekend newscasts.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KHII-TV (as KFVE) ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on January 15, 2009, the date on which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts (almost five months earlier than the June 12 transition date for stations on the U.S. mainland). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 23, using virtual channel 5. Following the channel swap with KGMB, the station&#x27;s digital channel switched to UHF channel 22 and its virtual channel to 9.

==Satellite stations==
As with other major television stations in Hawaii, KHII operates satellite stations across the Hawaiian Islands to rebroadcast the station&#x27;s programming outside of metropolitan Honolulu. The stations formerly served as KGMB satellite stations until the 2009 KGMB/KFVE facility swap, which resulted in both stations becoming satellites of KFVE. The 2019 purchase by Nexstar retained these stations as KHII satellites.

<text>The Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec () is the member of the Cabinet of Canada who also serves as the chief executive of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.

Prior to 2004, the portfolio was considered an add-on responsibility for a full Cabinet minister with other responsibilities, usually the Industry Minister. It was consequently termed the Minister &quot;responsible for&quot; the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.

Related regional development posts included Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario and Minister of Western Economic Diversification.

The post was vacant since 2015, with the last minister to hold this post being Denis Lebel. The post was abolished in 2021, with the Minister responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec portfolio being revived to take its place.

<doc id="845369" wikidata="Q1161902" url="?curid=845369" title="XTERRA Triathlon">
<text>XTERRA is a series of cross triathlon races, i.e. three-sport races which include swimming, mountain biking, and trail running. The XTERRA Global Tour is owned and produced by XTERRA Sports Limited. The XTERRA race series is the best-known series of cross triathlons, and is considered by most to be the &quot;de facto&quot; world championship of the sport.

It began in 1996 on the Hawaiian island of Maui as the &quot;Aquaterra&quot;, and was later renamed the &quot;XTERRA&quot;. Japanese automaker Nissan licensed the name from the triathlon series for their own 1999-2015 sport utility vehicle — and was the race series&#x27; primary sponsor from 1998 to 2006, when the two companies parted ways.

==Organization==
The XTERRA has two primary divisions, professional and &quot;age-groupers&quot;. In the professional division athletes compete for cash prizes and sponsorships. The age-group division was created for those who still want to compete but have no aspirations to become professional athletes. Both divisions compete in a points series, where athletes accumulate points by placing in the top fifteen positions of any race in which they compete.

Several events known as XTERRA Championships Series offer more points due to their larger draws. In the United States, there are championships for each region of the country. These venues also offer a &quot;sport&quot; version of the race where contestants complete races that are typically half the distance of the full version.

== Race format ==
As an off-road race, the distances can vary widely depending on the terrain available. The target distances are as follows:

*Championship/pro: 1.5 km swim, 30 km mountain biking, 11 km trail run
*Sport: 500 m swim, 15 km mountain biking, 5 km trail Run

The largest difference between the XTERRA race and a regular Triathlon is in the biking section. Though less than the standard 40k distance (in a regular Triathlon), XTERRA has steeper, more aggressive inclines for a shorter distance, usually between 27-30k, over rough terrain.

In the United States the sport distances are often used as miles yielding a 1/2 mile (805 m) swim, 15 mile (24 km) mountain bike, and a 5-mile (8-km) trail run.

<doc id="845382" wikidata="Q6776268" url="?curid=845382" title="Martin Newland">
<text>Martin Newland (born 26 October 1961) is a British journalist, a former Editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; who now consults on media and communications, most recently in the Middle East. He was an advisor to Abu Dhabi Media and before that was Executive Director Publishing, Abu Dhabi Media. Prior to that, he was launch Editor of &quot;The National&quot;, a national newspaper in Abu Dhabi. Before that, he was editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, a British broadsheet newspaper, from 2003 to 2005, replacing Charles Moore. Newland was appointed Editor upon his return from Canada where he was a launch editor and Deputy Editor of Conrad Black&#x27;s new national newspaper &quot;The National Post&quot;. The launch of the &quot;Post&quot; started one of the most costly and intense newspaper wars in North America.

==Education==
Newland was educated at Downside School, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Goldsmiths College at the University of London, where he took a BA in History and Heythrop College (also at the University of London), where he took an MA in Theology.

==Life and career==
Newland worked to preserve &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; when it was purchased in June 2004 from Hollinger International by the Barclay brothers, then owners of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper and &quot;The Business&quot; magazine.

After the takeover, it was confirmed that Newland would remain as editor under the new owners, despite some reports that he would be replaced by Dominic Lawson, editor of the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and others such as Andrew Neil, publisher of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;The Business&quot;.

Newland was opposed to introducing a compact (tabloid) version of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; but was known to want to introduce some changes to the broadsheet.

Newland resigned as &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; editor on 18 November 2005. His temporary replacement was confirmed as John Bryant, the Telegraph Group&#x27;s newly appointed Editor-in-Chief. Bryant was never officially editor of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, a much-coveted office previously held by the likes of Lord Deedes and Max Hastings.

In August 2007, &quot;Press Gazette&quot; reported that Newland was due to launch a new newspaper in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.

&quot;The National&quot;, was launched on 17 April 2008. It is the UAE&#x27;s sixth daily English-language newspaper but the only one printed in Abu Dhabi.

==Previous career==
Newland was born in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Prior to becoming editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, he worked at the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; from 1986 to 1989; then became a reporter and home editor on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (1989–98). He was deputy editor on the &quot;National Post&quot;, a conservative Canadian daily founded in 1998 by Lord Black of Crossharbour. Under Newland&#x27;s news direction, the upstart daily found a distinctive voice and quickly came to within striking distance of the venerable, but colourless &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, before mounting losses forced major cutbacks in editorial staffing levels. Before that Newland was home editor, news editor and a reporter for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

A devout Catholic, he is married to Benedicte, née Smets, the sister of Pascale Smets, who is married to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;″s pocket cartoonist Matt. The couple have four children.

In October 2006, the National Television Academy (NTA) honoured IPI with an International Emmy Award for its press freedom work.

==Activities==

===Protest letters===

IPI monitors press freedom around the world and responds to threats and attacks on journalists and media outlets by sending protest letters to governments and inter-governmental organisations. These threats are often brought to IPI&#x27;s attention by its members, many of whom experience such difficulties first-hand while carrying out their profession.

===Press freedom missions===

IPI leads missions to countries where press freedom is under threat, meeting with government officials, diplomats, journalists and non-governmental organisations, and providing legal representation and support in court cases.

===Research===

IPI undertakes extensive research on issues relevant to the media and circulates several publications on press freedom, including the quarterly magazine &quot;IPI Global Journalist&quot;. IPI regularly scrutinises new media laws and provides governments with recommendations on how to bring their legislation in line with internationally accepted standards on freedom of expression. IPI also monitors journalists killed worldwide. Since 1997, it has kept a Death Watch of media casualties.

===World Press Freedom Review===

Each year, IPI publishes an authoritative report on media violations around the world: The World Press Freedom Review.

===World Press Freedom Heroes===

In 2000, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, IPI named 50 journalists &quot;World Press Freedom Heroes&quot;. Since then, , ten more have been so named, including, posthumously, the murdered journalists Hrant Dink of Turkey and Anna Politkovskaya of Russia.

===IPI Free Media Pioneer Award===
Established in 1996, the IPI Free Media Pioneer Award honours individuals or organisations that fight against great odds to ensure freer and more independent media in their country or region. The award is co-sponsored by the US-based Freedom Forum, a non-partisan, international foundation dedicated to free press and free speech.

Recipients of the award started with NTV in Russia in 1996, the Alliance of Independent Journalists in Indonesia in 1997, and Radio B92 in Serbia in 1998. In 2022, there were seven awardees, &quot;ABO Local Media Development Agency&quot;, &quot;Hromadske&quot;, &quot;Slidstvo.info&quot;, &quot;StopFake&quot;, &quot;The Kyiv Independent&quot;, &quot;Ukraїner&quot; and &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; in Ukraine. IPI described the Ukrainian media organisations as having &quot;[risen] to face head-on the challenges and dangers brought by Russia&#x27;s war of aggression with courage, quality reporting, and a steadfast commitment to serving local communities at a time of immense need&quot;.

===IPI World Congress===

Each year, IPI holds an international congress where several hundred publishers, editors and senior journalists from around the world gather to debate and discuss a range of issues that concern the fight for a free media.

<doc id="845403" wikidata="Q764962" url="?curid=845403" title="Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)">
<text>Somebody Up There Likes Me is a 1956 American drama film directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman and Pier Angeli, based on the life of middleweight boxing legend Rocky Graziano. The supporting cast features Everett Sloane, Eileen Heckart, Harold J. Stone, and Sal Mineo.

The film was nominated for three Academy Awards, and won two: Best Cinematography (Black and White) (Joseph Ruttenberg) and Best Art Direction (Black and White) (Cedric Gibbons, Malcolm Brown, Edwin B. Willis, F. Keogh Gleason). It lost its nomination for Best Film Editing to &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

==Plot==
Rocky Graziano has a difficult childhood and is beaten by his father. He joins a street gang, and undergoes a long history of criminal activities. He is sent to prison, where he is rebellious to all authority figures. After his release, he is drafted by the U.S. Army, but runs away. Needing money, he becomes a boxer, and finds that he has natural talent and wins six fights in a row before the Army finds him and dishonorably discharges him. He serves a year in a United States Disciplinary Barracks, and resumes his career as a boxer as a result.

While working his way to the title, he is introduced to his sister&#x27;s friend Norma, whom he falls in love with and later marries. Starting a new, clean life, he rises to the top, but loses a title fight with Tony Zale. A person he knew in prison finds him and blackmails him into throwing a fight over his dishonorable discharge. Rocky fakes an injury and avoids the fight altogether. When he is interrogated by the district attorney, he refuses to name the blackmailer and has his license suspended. His manager gets him a fight in Chicago to fight Zale, the middleweight champion, once more. Rocky wins the fight.

==Cast==
==Production==
The role of Rocky Graziano was originally to be played by James Dean, but he died before filming began, and Paul Newman was asked to take the part. Australian actor Rod Taylor was also considered for the part; although unsuccessful, his screen test impressed MGM enough for them to offer him a long term contract.

The film was also notable for being one of Paul Newman&#x27;s first starring roles.

==Soundtrack==

Perry Como&#x27;s version of the title song is played over the opening and closing credits.

==Box office==
According to MGM records, the film earned $1,915,000 in the US and Canada and $1,445,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $609,000.

<doc id="845404" wikidata="Q282174" url="?curid=845404" title="Eddie Shore">
<text>Edward William Shore (November 25, 1902 – March 16, 1985) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman, principally for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League, and the longtime owner of the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League. Iconic for his aggressiveness, toughness and defensive skill, he was called both &quot;Old Blood and Guts&quot; and &quot;the Edmonton Express.&quot; In 2017, Shore was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

Shore won the Hart Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player four times, the most of any defenceman; only Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe have won it more often. After the league began naming NHL All-Star teams at the end of Shore&#x27;s fifth season, Shore was honoured as a First Team All-Star in seven of his last nine seasons, while being named a Second Team All-Star one of the other seasons; in the remaining season he missed over half the schedule due to injury. A bruiser known for his violence, Shore set a then-NHL record for 165 penalty minutes in his second season.

==Playing career==
Shore started his career with his hometown minor hockey team in Cupar, Saskatchewan, the Cupar Canucks. He played for the Melville Millionaires and won the 1923-24 Saskatchewan senior championship.

Shore moved up to professional hockey with the Regina Capitals of the Western Canada Hockey League in 1925. His team finished last in the league and moved to Portland after the season. Shore moved to the league champion Edmonton Eskimos in 1926, where he converted from forward to defence and was given the nickname &quot;the Edmonton Express&quot;.

When the Western Hockey League (renamed from the WCHL) folded in 1926, Shore was sold to the Boston Bruins of the NHL. As a rookie, he scored 12 goals and six assists for a total of 18 points and accumulated 130 penalty minutes. His first goal came on November 20, 1926 in Boston&#x27;s 5-1 loss to Chicago. Shore helped the Bruins win their first Stanley Cup in 1929.

In the 1925–26 season, Billy Coutu and Sprague Cleghorn of the Montreal Canadiens were traded to the Boston Bruins. During their first practice with the Bruins, Shore strutted back and forth in front of Coutu and Cleghorn. Coutu body-slammed, head-butted, elbowed and tried to torment Shore. Next Coutu picked up the puck and made a rush at Shore. The two players collided. Shore held his ground and Coutu flew through the air violently crashing to the ice. Shore&#x27;s ear was almost ripped off but he barely noticed it. Coutu was out cold and was out of commission for a week. Shore visited several doctors who wanted to amputate the ear, but found one who sewed it back on. After refusing anesthetic, Shore used a mirror to watch the doctor sew the ear on. Shore claimed Coutu used his hockey stick to cut off the ear, and Coutu was fined $50. Shore later recanted and Coutu&#x27;s money was refunded.

Another unusual incident involving Shore occurred in January 1930 when he was challenged to a boxing match by baseball player Art Shires. While NHL President Frank Calder said that Shore&#x27;s participation was up to Bruins&#x27; manager Art Ross to decide, baseball commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis vetoed Shires&#x27; participation, and the match was never held. On January 24, 1933, during a game against Montreal, Shore accidentally punched NHL referee-in-chief Cooper Smeaton during a fight with Sylvio Mantha and was fined $100.

On March 30, 1933, Shore scored a playoff overtime goal against Toronto, the only time he accomplished that feat in his career.

In Boston Garden on December 12, 1933, Shore ended the career of Toronto Maple Leafs star Ace Bailey when he hit Bailey from behind. When Bailey&#x27;s head hit the ice, he was knocked unconscious and went into convulsions. Moments earlier, Maple Leafs teammate King Clancy upended Shore with a hard check as he rushed up the ice. Angry, dazed, and thinking he was going after Clancy, Shore rushed at Bailey intent on revenge. In retaliation, the Leafs tough-guy Red Horner punched Shore, whose head hit the ice as he fell from the blow. Shore was knocked unconscious and required seven stitches but was not seriously injured. Bailey was rushed to hospital in critical condition with a fractured skull and was operated on for more than four hours. There were many fears that he could possibly die. He came out of a coma for the second time 10 days later, making a full recovery, but he did not play professionally again. When he was assured that Bailey would survive, league president Frank Calder suspended Shore for 16 games. An all-star benefit game was held at Maple Leaf Gardens on February 14, 1934, which raised $20,909 for Bailey and his family. Bailey and Shore shook hands and embraced at centre ice before the game began. Thirteen years later, the NHL introduced an annual all-star game.

Shore and the Bruins won their second Stanley Cup in 1939. Shore retired and bought the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League, where he was player-owner in 1939–40. He was persuaded to rejoin the Bruins after injuries to the Bruins&#x27; defence corps, with an agreement that he would play in home games for $200 per match. Shore played just four games for Boston, and was reported as being unenthusiastic about the arrangement. Obtaining permission to play in the Indians&#x27; home games, he began to agitate to play in Springfield road games as well, which provoked his trade to the New York Americans on January 25, 1940, for Eddie Wiseman and $5000. He stayed with the Americans through their elimination from the playoffs, and was simultaneously playing with the Indians in their playoff games. Shore&#x27;s final NHL game was March 24 against the Detroit Red Wings, which coincidentally was also the final NHL game for Hall of Famer and teammate Nels Stewart.

In February 1940, Shore and eight other arena managers organized the Ice Capades.

==Retirement and the Indians==

Although Shore had played his last NHL game, he played two more seasons in Springfield. The Indians halted operations during World War II, and Shore moved his players to Buffalo where he coached the Buffalo Bisons of the AHL to the Calder Cup championship in 1943 and 1944. After the war, the Springfield Indians resumed play in 1946 and Shore returned.

In addition to owning the Indians, Shore purchased the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHL) in May 1948, and owned the team until it folded in December 1949.

As an owner, Shore could be cantankerous and was often accused of treating players with little respect. He commonly had Springfield players who had been out of the lineup perform maintenance in the Eastern States Coliseum, the Indians&#x27; home, referring to them as &quot;Black Aces&quot;. Today, the term is commonly used to refer to extra players on the roster who train with the team in case of injury. Despite this, the Indians prospered under his ownership, making the playoffs 12 times and winning three Calder Cups in a row from 1960 to 1962. During the 1967 season, the entire Indians team refused to play after Shore suspended three players without pay, including future NHL star Bill White, for what he said was &quot;indifferent play&quot;. When the team asked for an explanation, Shore suspended the two players who spoke for the team, one of whom was Brian Kilrea. Alan Eagleson, then a little-known lawyer and sometime politician, was brought in to negotiate with Shore on the players&#x27; behalf. The battle escalated for months, ending with Shore giving up day-to-day operation of the club to the Los Angeles Kings; the genesis of the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association stems from that incident. Shore took back full control of the team in 1974, changed its name back to the Indians and restored its traditional blue-white-red scheme. He continued to own the team until he sold it in 1976.

For his contributions to the game of hockey, Eddie Shore was awarded the vanity license plate &quot;MR HOCKEY&quot; by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

On March 15, 1985, Shore was visiting his son in Springfield, Massachusetts. That night, Shore began coughing up and vomiting blood and was later rushed to the hospital. He was pronounced dead the next morning and the cause of death was later determined to be liver cancer. His funeral was held in his hometown five days later. He is buried in Hillcrest Park Cemetery in the Sixteen Acres section of Springfield.

Shore was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947. The Boston Bruins retired his uniform number, 2. The Eddie Shore Award is given annually to the AHL&#x27;s best defenceman. In 1998, he was ranked number 10 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, making him the highest-ranked pre-World War II player.

==Cultural references==
In the film &quot;Slap Shot&quot;, Eddie Shore&#x27;s name, along with Toe Blake and Dit Clapper, is considered synonymous with &quot;old-time hockey.&quot; Shore is also featured in the Don Cherry biopic &quot;Keep Your Head Up Kid: The Don Cherry Story&quot; where he was portrayed by Stephen McHattie.

<text>Sezen Aksu (; born Fatma Sezen Yıldırım; 13 July 1954) is a Turkish singer, songwriter and producer. She is one of the most successful Turkish singers, having sold over 40 million albums worldwide. Her nicknames include the &quot;Queen of Turkish Pop&quot; and &quot;Minik Serçe&quot; (&quot;Little Sparrow&quot;).

Aksu&#x27;s influence on Turkish pop and world music has continued since her debut in 1975, and has been reinforced by her patronage of and collaboration with many other musicians, including Yonca Evcimik, Sertab Erener, Şebnem Ferah, Aşkın Nur Yengi, Hande Yener, Yıldız Tilbe, Işın Karaca, Seden Gürel, Harun Kolçak and Levent Yüksel. Sezen Aksu is widely known as a successful songwriter. Her work with Tarkan resulted in continental hits like &quot;Şımarık&quot; and &quot;Şıkıdım&quot; and her collaboration with Goran Bregović widened her international audience. In 2010, NPR named her as one of the &quot;50 Great Voices&quot; of the world.

== Biography ==
Sezen Aksu was born in Sarayköy, Denizli, Turkey. Her father was a mathematics teacher. Her family moved to Bergama when she was three years old and she spent her childhood and early youth there. Aksu&#x27;s parents discouraged her singing because they wanted her to have a steady profession as a doctor or engineer. She used to wait until they left the house and sing on the family&#x27;s balcony. After finishing high school, she began studying at the local agricultural institute, but left college to concentrate on music.

Along with her close friend Ajda Pekkan, Aksu is credited with laying the foundations of Turkish pop music in the 1970s. Her sound has also spread across the Balkans and Greece. Aksu has also toured in Europe and the U.S to critical appraise.

She has championed a variety of causes, including support for constitutional reform, minority rights, women&#x27;s rights, the environment, and educational reform in Turkey. Aksu has been married and divorced four times, but kept the name from her second marriage to Ali Engin Aksu, a doctor of geology who currently resides in Canada. She has a son with Sinan Özer, named Mithat Can, who is also a lead vocalist of Pist&#x27;on band.

== Career ==
===1975–1983: Early life and career beginnings===
Sezen Aksu released her first single, &quot;Haydi Şansım/Gel Bana&quot; in 1975 under the name of &quot;Sezen Seley&quot;. However, she remained undiscovered until her 1976 single &quot;Olmaz Olsun/Vurdumduymaz&quot; reached number one in the Turkish charts. In 1976, Sezen Aksu won the &quot;Promising Female Artist of the Year&quot; award. Her first album was 1977&#x27;s &quot;Allahaısmarladık&quot;, released as a 33&#x27;s and named after her previous single &quot;Allahaısmarladık/Kaç Yıl Geçti Aradan&quot;, contains her previous singles as well as a few additional pieces like &quot;Uzun Lafın Kısası&quot; and &quot;Gözlerindeki Bulut&quot;.

Aksu finally decided to represent Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest in the mid-70s. However, even though she competed in the national finals for the competition three times, with &quot;Küçük Bir Aşk Masalı&quot; (A Little Love Tale) as a duet with Özdemir Erdoğan, &quot;Heyamola&quot; which was performed as a trio with Coşkun Demir and Ali Kocatepe, and &quot;1945&quot; which was a solo performance, she did not get the chance to represent Turkey abroad. It was to be left to her pupil, Sertab Erener, to win the Eurovision and realise Aksu&#x27;s dream to push her musical vision further into Europe.

===1980s===
In the 80&#x27;s, Aksu had a relationship with Turkish-Armenian producer Onno Tunç that was both romantic and professional. As a couple they put their signatures to works that broke new ground in Turkish pop music, such as &quot;Sen Ağlama&quot;, &quot;Git&quot;, &quot;Sezen Aksu&#x27;88&quot; and &quot;Sezen Aksu Söylüyor&quot;. Her music matured in the 90&#x27;s, when she co-produced her best selling album to-date &quot;Gülümse&quot; with Tunç. The A-1 track from the album called &quot;Hadi Bakalım&quot; was a hit in Turkey and Europe, and was published as a single in Germany. It was to be later rediscovered in Europop by singer Loona as Rhythm of the Night. She also began to produce albums for her vocalists, notably producing Aşkın Nur Yengi&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sevgiliye&quot; (To a Lover) again with Tunç. She was to repeat her success as a teacher with artists Sertab Erener and Levent Yüksel.

===1990s–present===
Parting ways with Tunç, in 1995, Aksu branched out with the experimental album &quot;Işık Doğudan Yükselir&quot;, drawing both on western classical and regional Turkish musical traditions. This album made her name known outside Turkey and gave her a worldwide audience, especially in Europe. In 1996, she released &quot;Düş Bahçeleri&quot; as a tribute to Tunç, who died that same year tragically when his private plane crashed. In 1997, she released &quot;Düğün ve Cenaze&quot;, this time collaborating with Goran Bregović.

She returned to her roots with &quot;Adı Bende Saklı&quot;, which was released in 1998. She began to use experimental sounds and was once again pushing Turkish pop into the future. Aksu continued with this trend with her subsequent albums &quot;Deliveren&quot;, &quot;Şarkı Söylemek Lazım&quot; (which also featured former Sparks bassist Martin Gordon as engineer/mixer, who also was bass player on her subsequent European tour), and &quot;Yaz Bitmeden&quot; between the years 2000–2003. After a two-year hiatus, she returned with &quot;Bahane&quot; in 2005. That same year she released &quot;Kardelen&quot;, where all proceeds went to charity, and before the end of 2005 released a &quot;Bahane/Remixes&quot; double-CD album, which contained the original &quot;Bahane&quot; album in disc one and the remixes of songs in disc two.
In 2005, she was featured in Fatih Akın&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul&quot; with a performance of the song &quot;İstanbul Hatırası&quot;. In 2006, Aksu published a book called &quot;Eksik Şiir&quot;, a collection of 197 songs written by her between 1975-2006. The book was well-received and sold 17,000 copies in the first 4 days after its release. It was followed by &quot;Eksik Şiir İkinci Kitap&quot; in 2016.

In 2008, Aksu released her album called &quot;Deniz Yıldızı&quot; through Starfish Records. In 2009 she released her album &quot;Yürüyorum Düş Bahçelerinde&quot;. The album contains new original songs as well as some older songs which were composed by Sezen Aksu for other singers, most notably &quot;Çakkıdı&quot;, &quot;Kibir&quot;, &quot;Yok Ki&quot;.
In 2010, Aksu was on the &quot;50 Great Sounds&quot; list set by the American NPR radio. Sezen Aksu&#x27;s concert with Fahir Atakoğlu in Stockholm, Sweden in April 2010 was attended by many Turkish and Swedish music lovers. After a 10-year break, &quot;TurkofAmerica&quot; and &quot;GNL Entertainment&quot; organized a series of concerts by Aksu in the USA, with the corporate sponsorship of the Washington-based Turkish Cultural Foundation. The three concerts were held between 4–7 April at three different venues: Strathmore in Maryland, Carnegie Hall in New York, and Prudential Hall in New Jersey. Atakoğlu also accompanied Aksu during her concerts in the USA. After performing well over the time allocated for her New Jersey concert, Aksu told the audience: &quot;We have exceeded the [time] limits, the Americans have also set a record of patience, New Jersey will be like this tonight, I will not leave this scene until I make all of you happy&quot;.

In 2011, Aksu bean producing music again and released the studio album &quot;Öptüm&quot;. The album consists of songs written and composed by Aksu, including &quot;Unuttun mu Beni&quot;, &quot;Vay&quot;, &quot;Aşka Şükrederim&quot;, &quot;Ah Felek Yordun Beni&quot;, and also features a song written by Nazan Öncel titled &quot;Ballı&quot;. Cemal Süreya&#x27;s poem &quot;Sayım&quot; was turned by Aksu into a song and included in the album as well.

At her concert in Volkswagen Arena Istanbul in January 2016, Aksu announced that she would retire from performing live on stage: &quot;Each ending is a new beginning. I will continue to produce [music], but I&#x27;m going to say goodbye to the stage after doing a few concerts I promised before. This is my last concert in Istanbul. I&#x27;m grateful for having you here with me today in memory of 40 years of my career.&quot; In September, she stated again that she would continue making music.

In January 2022, Aksu was criticized by conservatives and religious figures for calling Adam and Eve ignorant in the song &quot;Ne Şahane Bir Şey Yaşamak&quot; (a cover of the 2012 song &quot;C&#x27;est la vie&quot;). The song was originally included in the 2017 tribute album &quot;Alakasız Şarkılar, Vol. 1&quot; in memory of Yaşar Gaga, but resurfaced on the social media in early 2022 after its lyric video was published on Aksu&#x27;s official YouTube channel on 30 December 2021. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, leader of the Nationalist Movement Party Devlet Bahçeli, and the Directorate of Religious Affairs, were among the political figures and government agencies that criticized Aksu and the song. After remaining silent for a month, Aksu eventually released a statement on her Facebook account on January 22. &quot;As you know, the matter is not me; the matter is the country,&quot; she remarked, thanking everyone who have shown their support for her. Aksu also revealed the lyrics to a new song she wrote the previous day: &quot;You won&#x27;t be able to crush my tongue.&quot;

==Activism==

Aksu is known for her sensitivity to social problems and events. In 2009 she supported Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&#x27;s democratic initiative and the settlement process in Turkey. As a result journalist Hikmet Çetinkaya claimed that Aksu&#x27;s father was a supporter of the Nur movement. While some artists stood behind Aksu, some expressed that Aksu&#x27;s behavior was unreasonable. In 2012, Aksu wrote the song &quot;Tanrının Gözyaşları&quot; (Tears of God) in memory of soldiers who had died during the Kurdish–Turkish conflict.

About the young people who participated in the first days of the Gezi Park protests in 2013 she said: &quot;This is the first youth revolution in the world. They have sent an extraordinary message and the people there and those who are coming to the streets are speaking their words with an extraordinary language.&quot; In 2014, she again paid tribute to the young people who took part in the protests with her new single &quot;Yeni ve Yeni Kalanlar&quot;.

Aksu is keen to fight against issues such as misogyny, illiteracy, discrimination, bullying and homophobia. According to the LGBT magazine, KAOS GL, she is a major gay icon, with the Turkish LGBT community embracing her as a pop culture representative. In 2002, alongside Ajda Pekkan and Seyyal Taner, Aksu was named as one of the gay icons admired by the Turkish LGBT people in the book &quot;Eşcinsel Erkekler&quot; by Murat Hocaoğlu. In a survey conducted by KAOS GL, she was chosen as one of the favorite gay icons by the participants. Aksu is praised by the LGBT community in Turkey and publicly assists and supports LGBT people through charity work. In 2008, she supported LGBT association Lambdaistanbul, which was closed by a court decision based on &quot;the fact that it is contrary to general morality&quot;. In 2013, Aksu performed with transsexual actress Ayta Sözeri on stage, and later a huge rainbow flag symbolizing the LGBT movement was waved in the air, the first time that a Turkish artist had publicly shown support for LGBT on stage. Later in 2013, she published a statement on her official website in support of the SPOD (Social Policy Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Studies Association) on its first anniversary. In her statement, she mentioned Mesut Şaban Okan, nicknamed &quot;İrem&quot;, who was a victim of hate crime in Bursa in 2010. Referencing Melek Okan&#x27;s words about her child&#x27;s death, who had said &quot;They could not find a place for my child anywhere in the whole world!&quot;, Aksu talked about violence against LGBT people and added that she would fight against violence and discrimination.

266854 Sezenaksu, an asteroid discovered in 2009, is named after the artist.

== Personal life ==

Sezen Aksu married Hasan Yüksektepe at a young age, and the two got divorced shortly afterwards. At the beginning of her professional life, she married Ali Engin Aksu, whose surname she adopted and later used. On 10 July 1981, Sezen Aksu married Sinan Özer while being pregnant with their child. The couple divorced in 1983. Her marriage to journalist Ahmet Utlu in 1993 was also short-lived and ended in divorce.

<doc id="845409" wikidata="Q5228097" url="?curid=845409" title="USS Anchorage (LSD-36)">
<text>USS &quot;Anchorage&quot; (LSD-36) was the lead ship of the of the United States Navy. In the ship&#x27;s 34 years of service, she completed 19 deployments in the western Pacific and became the most decorated dock landing ship on the west coast.

==Construction==
&quot;Anchorage&quot; was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 29 June 1965 and her keel was laid down on 13 March 1967. She was launched on 5 May 1968; sponsored by Mrs. Alexander S. Heyward, Jr., the wife of Vice Admiral Alexander S. Heyward; and commissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 15 March 1969.

Outfitted with a large floodable stern section accessed through an enormous operable stern gate, &quot;Anchorage&quot; served as a launch platform for large landing craft, such as the LCU, as well as a &quot;boat haven&quot; to shelter other small craft utilized in an amphibious landing. The ship was able to provide a minimal degree of naval gunfire support through the use of two sets of twin /50 caliber guns mounted on the 02-level fore and aft. In later years these guns were removed to be replaced with Mk-38 machine guns and two Phalanx CIWS for missile defense. In its final decade of service with the US Navy, it functioned primarily as a platform for two LCAC hovercraft landing vehicles and embarked Marines.

==Service history==
After a brief, round-trip cruise to Andros Island, Bahamas, the &quot;Anchorage&quot; left Norfolk on 24 June, bound for the west coast. She paused at Mayport and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; transited the Panama Canal on 16 July; and arrived at her home port San Diego, California, on 26 July. At the end of shakedown training off the California coast, she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on 1 November, for post-shakedown availability.

===Pacific – Far East service===
====1970====
&quot;Anchorage&quot; participated in numerous military operations. At the end of the Vietnam War, the ship carried Marines back to the United States as a part of the US withdrawal from Vietnam.

&quot;Anchorage&quot; returned to San Diego on 9 January 1970. She set sail on the 31st for the western Pacific (WestPac) to transport Marine Corps personnel back to the United States as part of Operation Keystone Bluejay, a planned withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. On 19 February, the ship arrived at Danang, Republic of Vietnam; took on board the personnel and equipment of the 7th Motor Battalion; and sailed for the United States. She reached Delmar, California, on 12 March and debarked her passengers.

Following a month and one-half in port at San Diego for training and upkeep, &quot;Anchorage&quot; got underway on 1 May with other units of Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 5 for the Far East. She stopped at Pearl Harbor and then sailed to Johnston Atoll to deliver several landing craft. The ship next proceeded to Yokosuka, Japan, and arrived there on 19 May for voyage repairs. Her next port call was at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where Marines came on board for transportation to Subic Bay, Philippines. Upon the completion of that embarkation, PhibRon 5 units assumed duty as Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) Alfa.

From 6 to 18 June, &quot;Anchorage&quot; carried small craft between ports along the coast of Vietnam. Her ports of call included Vung Tau, Camranh Bay, Qui Nhon, Danang, and An Thoi, near Phú Quốc. She anchored near An Thoi from 11 to 14 June to provide dry dock services for the ships at the naval activity there.

On 22 June, the ship participated in the first of several amphibious exercises conducted by ARG Alfa at Green Beach, near Subic Bay. During these operations, she acted as a primary control ship for the direction and control of landing craft while they moved to the beach.

The ship pulled into Sasebo, Japan, early in July for a period of rest and relaxation for the crew. She got underway again on 16 July for amphibious exercises off Green Beach. On the 31st, she arrived at Okinawa to take Battalion Landing Team 2/9 on board for transportation to Subic Bay. &quot;Anchorage&quot; arrived at Subic Bay on 18 August for upkeep. Her next port of call was Hong Kong, which she visited from 10 until 18 September and then returned to the Subic Bay operating area.

From 24 September through 8 October, &quot;Anchorage&quot; traveled among Subic Bay and Vung Tau, Camranh Bay and Danang, Vietnam, carrying various small craft. Late in October, she carried out relief operations in Lagonoy Gulf on the eastern coast of the Philippines for victims of Typhoons Joan and Kate. After touching at Keelung, Taiwan, on 29 October, the ship proceeded to Okinawa to pick up a landing craft for transportation to Subic Bay. She took part in amphibious exercises at Green Beach on 7 November, then put into port at Subic Bay. From the 20th to the 23d, Anchorage was at Okinawa to disembark Marines and to unload their equipment. During this time, PhibRon 5 was relieved of duties as ARG Alfa. The ship then paid a short visit to Yokosuka, Japan, for liberty and the loading of equipment for transportation to the United States. Sailing from Japan on 30 November, the vessel arrived in San Diego on 10 December.

====1971====
&quot;Anchorage&quot; remained in availability until 20 February 1971, when she got underway for Port Hueneme, California. There, she loaded construction materials for a communications center on the island in the Indian Ocean, Diego Garcia, to be built as a part of Operation Reindeer Station. She left the California coast on 22 February bound for Australia. The vessel made port calls at Sydney and Perth, Australia, late in March and then pushed on into the Indian Ocean. Upon arriving at Diego Garcia on 4 April, she unloaded the construction materials and sailed the next day for Subic Bay to obtain minor repairs and replenishment. Following a visit to Hong Kong from 17 to 22 April, the ship sailed to Danang where she embarked Marine Corps personnel and equipment for return to the United States as part of Operation Keystone Robin. On 23 April, she shaped a course for San Diego.

&quot;Anchorage&quot; arrived in her home port on 11 May and, on 28 June, resumed operations as a training ship for landing exercises off Seal Beach, California. This study was followed by refresher training and a period inport at San Diego. From 2 to 6 August, the vessel was again involved in exercises off Seal Beach. She left San Diego on 16 August to sail to her namesake city, Anchorage, Alaska, where she remained from 22 to 26 August. After pausing at Alameda, California, to unload aircraft, she arrived back at San Diego on 1 September and entered upkeep.

The ship sailed for Hawaii on 1 October and, en route, participated in Convoy Exercise 3-71. She spent two days at Pearl Harbor before continuing on to Buckner Bay, Okinawa. There, she rejoined ARG Alfa and embarked Marines for transportation to Subic Bay. Early in November, the ship visited Kaohsiung, Taiwan. From 13 to 20 November, she shuttled landing craft between Vung Tau and Subic Bay. During the last few weeks of 1971, the ship visited Sasebo, Japan, and Hong Kong for liberty calls and also carried Marines and equipment from Okinawa to Subic Bay.

====1972====
After a period of repair work, &quot;Anchorage&quot; sailed for Buckner Bay on 17 January 1972 to embark Marines for transportation back to Subic Bay. Late in January, she carried out wet-well operations at Danang, Qui Nhon, and Vung Tau and, in mid-February, traveled to Singapore for a visit before returning to Subic Bay. After a brief trip to Kure, Japan, in early March, the ship was involved in amphibious exercises. On 31 March, she got underway to rendezvous with Task Group 76.5 which she met on 2 April for operations off the coast of Vietnam through 6 May.

The ship was at Subic Bay from 9 to 18 May and then sailed back to Vietnamese waters for wet-well lifts to Vung Tau, Hoi An, and Danang. On 24 May, she took part in Exercise &quot;Song Thanh 6-72&quot;. She reached Okinawa on 14 June to embark troops bound for the Philippines and arrived at Subic Bay on the 20th. After a series of amphibious landing exercises, &quot;Anchorage&quot; resumed wet-well operations between Vung Tau and Subic Bay.

The vessel visited Kaohsiung in early July, then arrived back at Subic Bay on the 8th. She left the Philippines, bound for home, on 9 July and made San Diego on 24 July. She remained in port through 4 December, when the vessel got underway for independent type exercises off the southern California coast. She returned to San Diego on the 7th and entered a holiday leave and upkeep status.

====1973====
After local operations, &quot;Anchorage&quot; traveled to Seal Beach late in January 1973 to unload her ammunition. She returned to San Diego on 1 February and began overhaul there on the 19th. During this yard work, a fire broke out in a maintenance shop and prolonged her stay in overhaul. The ship finally got underway on 23 September for sea trials and started refresher amphibious training late in October. On 8 December, the vessel commenced another WestPac deployment.

====1974====
During the cruise, the ship visited Subic Bay; Buckner Bay; Sasebo and Iwakuni, Japan; Diego Garcia; and Singapore. While off Korea, &quot;Anchorage&quot; joined ARG Bravo for Operation Fly Away. Leaving Subic Bay on 28 March 1974, she made stops at Guam and Pearl Harbor before arriving back in San Diego on 18 April and entering a standdown period which lasted through 29 July. On that day, the ship sailed northward to carry out a survey mission of potential amphibious training areas in Alaska. During her cruise, embarked scientists surveyed 10 possible landing sites and the vessel visited in Seattle, Washington; Nanaimo, British Columbia; and Sitka and Anchorage, Alaska, before reaching San Diego again on 5 September. &quot;Anchorage&quot; began a restricted availability at Long Beach, California, on 17 October and, after the work was completed on 16 December, she returned to home port for the holidays.

====1975====
On 6 January 1975, the ship began two weeks of amphibious refresher training off the southern California coast. She then participated in Operation Bedstream with other ships of PhibRon 5. After a period of upkeep in San Diego, &quot;Anchorage&quot; again sailed for the Orient on 28 March.

In April 1975, &quot;Anchorage&quot; participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam. The ship reached Vietnamese waters on 30 April and provided material support to ships evacuating Vietnamese refugees. On 2 May, she left the Vung Tau holding area with the other ships involved in Operation Frequent Wind.

On 13 May, her scheduled operations were interrupted by the Mayaguez incident. &quot;Anchorage&quot; was ordered to proceed south to provide support as needed for the rescue of . Following the ship&#x27;s rescue, &quot;Anchorage&quot; resumed her original schedule which included upkeep in Sasebo, Japan; a visit to Keelung, Taiwan; and a port call to Inchon, Republic of Korea. Early September brought her a liberty call at Hong Kong. She then proceeded to Yokosuka for upkeep. Following stops at Keelung and Buckner Bay, &quot;Anchorage&quot; sailed from Okinawa on 28 October to return to her home port. En route, she participated in Operation Polymode before arriving at San Diego on 16 November for upkeep and local operations through the end of the year.

====1976====
During the first three and one-half months of 1976 &quot;Anchorage&quot; continued local operations off the southern California coast. From 26 April through 17 June, she was in restricted availability in preparation for a visit to Alaska. However, that trip was cancelled, and the ship prepared to deploy for the rest of the year.

====1977====
Tests and inspections occupied &quot;Anchorage&quot; during the first two and one-half months of 1977 before another WestPac deployment began on 28 March. She stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor, then pushed on to Eniwetok to unload cargo and vehicles. During her cruise, the ship served as a member of ARG Alfa. She also visited Guam; Subic Bay and Iloilo, Philippines; Singapore; Hong Kong; Keelung; and Yokosuka. Among the amphibious exercises in which she participated was Operation Fortress Lightning, held in the Philippines, in waters near Santa Cruz, Mindanao Island, from 10 to 23 October. Upon the conclusion of this exercise, the vessel made her way back to the west coast of the United States via Okinawa, Guam, and Hawaii. On 17 November, she pulled into San Diego and spent the rest of the year in upkeep.

====1978====
The ship was involved in training operations along the California coast in January 1978. On 20 February, she got underway for Bremerton, Washington, to carry Army troops to their home base. The ship arrived at San Diego on 3 March and began preparations for overhaul. She got underway, in tow of , for the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 14 April, and commenced a regular overhaul there the next day. Upon completion of this work, the ship resumed operations on 13 December when she began sea trials.

====1979====
&quot;Anchorage&quot; returned to San Diego on 15 January 1979. During the next eight months, she was involved in post-overhaul maintenance and training. She operated along the southern California coast and held refresher training and amphibious refresher training. On 24 September, the ship got underway to take part in Exercise Kernal Potlatch II, a joint American-Canadian fleet exercise. Having concluded a successful amphibious landing on the northern coast of Vancouver Island, she made a port call at Esquimalt, British Columbia. After debarking Marines at Camp Pendleton, &quot;Anchorage&quot; returned to San Diego on 13 October. She participated in local operations and training exercises through the end of the year in preparation for an upcoming deployment in 1980.

====1980====
Four days into the new year, &quot;Anchorage&quot; slipped her moorings and left San Diego bound for the exotic Orient. Along the way, she visited Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and Guam in the Mariana Islands before arriving at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 6 February 1980. Upon arrival, she loaded a refurbished utility landing craft (LCU) for transportation to the Republic of Djibouti, former French Somaliland, located on the northeast coast of Africa near the Horn of Africa. The LCU-dubbed Le Bac de la Paix (tr. the boat of peace)-was a gift from the United States to Djibouti to enhance the country&#x27;s inadequate commercial transportation system. &quot;Anchorage&quot; stood out of Subic Bay on 15 February to begin her goodwill mission. Steaming by way of Singapore, she crossed the Indian Ocean and arrived in Djibouti on 3 March. The &quot;Anchorage&quot; spent two days in Djibouti, delivering America&#x27;s gift and helping to cement relations between the two governments and peoples. From Djibouti, she headed for Diego Garcia Island to deliver barges to that isolated American outpost in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The ship stopped at Diego Garcia from 12 to 15 March and then resumed her voyage back to the Philippines. She made a stop at Penang, Malaysia, along the way and reentered Subic Bay on 24 March.

During the three months that remained of her 1980 deployment, &quot;Anchorage&quot; carried out operations in surroundings more familiar to 7th Fleet ships than the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean. Early in April, she visited Hong Kong before voyaging to Okinawa to embark Marine Corps units on the 17th and 18th. From Okinawa, the dock landing ship sailed via Subic Bay and Singapore to Thailand where she joined elements of the Royal Thai Navy and the Royal Thai Marine Corps in amphibious training exercises. She concluded the interlude in Thai waters with a visit to Pattaya between 5 and 10 May. &quot;Anchorage&quot; returned to Subic Bay on 19 May and remained in port until near the end of the first week in June. On 6 June, she got underway to return the embarked Marines to their base on Okinawa. She stopped at Naha, Okinawa, from 10 to 12 June and then returned to sea for the voyage back to the United States. The trip home included a two-day stop at Pearl Harbor and ended back at San Diego on 3 July.

After the usual month of relative inactivity following an overseas deployment, &quot;Anchorage&quot; began west coast operations early in August with a courtesy visit to Seattle, Washington, for the city&#x27;s annual sea fair. Normal duties continued until late September when she returned to San Diego for a two-month availability. &quot;Anchorage&quot; completed repairs on 20 November and resumed operations out of her home port.

====1981====
Various training evolutions occupied her time through May and into June 1981. On 23 June, &quot;Anchorage&quot; stood out of San Diego on her way to duty with the 7th Fleet in the Far East. She stopped at Pearl Harbor at the beginning of July and remained in the Hawaiian Islands for the first three weeks of the month completing an oft-delayed propulsion plant certification. On the 22d, she resumed her voyage west. &quot;Anchorage&quot; entered her first western Pacific port at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 3 August and embarked Marine Corps units for transportation to Yokosuka, Japan. Throughout, her assignment with the 7th Fleet, &quot;Anchorage&quot; spent much of her time carrying Marines between their bases and training exercises. In some cases, &quot;Anchorage&quot; herself participated in the exercises; in others, she simply provided transportation to the location of the exercise. Consequently, she called at a number of ports in the Orient-most frequently at ports in Okinawa, Japan, and Korea but also at Thai ports occasionally. &quot;Anchorage&quot; completed her last 7th Fleet mission at Naha, Okinawa, late in November and, on the 21st got underway for the voyage back to California. En route, she made an 11-day visit to Guam and a brief, one-day pause at Pearl Harbor. She pulled into San Diego two days before Christmas.

====1982====
Post-deployment leave and upkeep carried her well into January 1982. After a brief period underway in the southern California operating area &quot;Anchorage&quot; began preparations at the end of January for regular overhaul at San Diego. The actual repair and modification work began on 1 March. Over the ensuing seven months, the ship received general repairs and upgrading throughout as well as work on her propulsion plant, modernization of her communications spaces, and an enhancement of her defense capability against antiship missiles. &quot;Anchorage&quot; conducted sea trials in the local operating area during the first half of November and then spent the remainder of the year in port.

====1983====
&quot;Anchorage&quot; resumed operations out of San Diego early in 1983. In May, she paid a courtesy visit to her namesake city, Anchorage, Alaska. Upon her return to San Diego in the middle of June, &quot;Anchorage&quot; began a three-month availability in preparation for a deployment to the western Pacific scheduled to start in the middle of September. Except for a period underway between 22 and 31 August, &quot;Anchorage&quot; was in San Diego continuously from 11 June to 12 September. On the latter day, she slipped her moorings and stood out to sea on her way back to the Far East. The usual stop at Pearl Harbor lasted from 20 September to 2 October, and then &quot;Anchorage&quot; resumed the voyage west. The dock landing ship arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 14 October. She spent the rest of October at Yokosuka, then got underway for Okinawa on 1 November to begin conveying Marine Corps units between their bases and the sites of training exercises. As in the past, the dock landing ship participated in some, but not all, of the exercises to which she provided transportation for the Marines.

====1984====
The deployment lasted through the end of 1983 and into the early months of 1984. She disembarked her last Marine Corps passengers at Yokosuka at the end of January 1984 and remained there until the beginning of the second week in February. On the 8th, &quot;Anchorage&quot; set out upon the first leg of the voyage back to the United States. On her way, she made stops at Guam and at Pearl Harbor before ending the deployment at San Diego on 6 March 1984. Except for a brief period underway inside the port on 17 April, Anchorage remained moored at San Diego for almost five months performing repairs and modifications. Near the end of July, she began sea trials out of San Diego that lasted into the fourth week in August. On 23 August the dock landing ship made the brief passage from San Diego to her new home port, Long Beach. &quot;Anchorage&quot; took about two weeks to get settled into her new base of operations and then embarked upon a series of training evolutions in the local operating area.

====1985–1986====
Those drills and exercises - punctuated by periods in port for upkeep and repairs - occupied her time during the remaining months of 1984 and for most of the first quarter of 1985. On 27 March 1985, she left Long Beach bound for the Orient. The dock landing ship interrupted her long voyage briefly at Sasebo, Japan, on 16 April to pick up mail and then arrived at Pohang, Korea, on the 17th. At Pohang, &quot;Anchorage&quot; embarked a Marine Corps contingent and set sail for Okinawa on 18 April. For the next four months, she criss-crossed the distant reaches of the Pacific delivering Marines to various points for combat training and returning them to their bases. On occasion, she joined in the exercises herself to practice her role as an amphibious warship. Her final group of passengers came on board at Yokohama, Japan, between 9 and 11 August and disembarked at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on the 14th.

On the 15th Anchorage began the passage home. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from the 26th to the 28th and arrived in Del Mar, Calif., on 3 September 1985. The following day, &quot;Anchorage&quot; moved to Long Beach where she began a five-week post-deployment stand-down. With her return to active operations on 10 October, &quot;Anchorage&quot; embarked upon an extended period of local operations that occupied her not only during the remainder of 1985 but for the whole of 1986 as well.

====1987====
As of the beginning of 1987, Anchorage was moored at Long Beach. In January 1987, Anchorage got underway for her Westpac deployment. Whilst in the Bering Sea, the ship and crew battled 90-foot (27 m) seas sailing through an area where two cyclones had merged. Unfortunately, the USS Belleau Wood (LHA 3) received extensive damage from the storm which led to an extended stay in the naval shipyards at Subic Bay. Other ports of call during the deployment included Okinawa, Japan; Pohang and Pusan, Korea; Pattaya Beach, Thailand; Hobart, Tasmania and Pearl Harbor, HI.

Anchorage had the privilege to turn sailors and Marines into Golden Shellbacks on 4 March 1987 when she crossed the Equator and the International Dateline simultaneously. During the 1987 crossing, Anchorage was hosting Golf Battery 3/12. After the Crossing the Line Ceremony at the Equator, Belleau Wood lost power as both engines and one of two generators stopped, causing her to drift for 5 days at sea and have to be towed by the Anchorage. Destined for Tasmania, the Belleau Wood limped into Sydney Harbor for repairs to the boilers while the Anchorage replaced her in Tasmania. This left the Belleau Wood with the unfortunate nickname &#x27;The USS Driftwood&#x27;.

===Operation Desert Storm===
====1991====
In 1991, she served in Operation Desert Storm.

====1994====
In 1994, she served in Operation Continue Hope in Mogadishu, Somalia. Also while there assisted in Operation Quick Draw and Operation Distant Runner with the Hotel Rwanda incident and Burundi.

====1996====
In 1996, following completion of a deployment during which she supported Operation Southern Watch in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Anchorage&quot; entered dry dock for her final dry dock planned maintenance availability during which she received numerous systems upgrades and modifications.

===USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing===
====2000====

Later in 2000 she was used to assist following her bombing in Yemen.

===Middle East operations – decommissioning===
====2003==== 
In July 2003, &quot;Anchorage&quot; returned to her home port of San Diego, California after supporting Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. She was decommissioned on 1 October 2003.

&quot;Anchorage&quot; was approved for transfer to Taiwan by the United States Senate in November 2003. She was scheduled to replace the former , now &quot;Chung Cheng&quot;, however the transfer never took place and &quot;Anchorage&quot; remained at the Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility at Pearl Harbor.

====2010====
On 17 July 2010, &quot;Anchorage&quot; was used as a target during RIMPAC for Maverick and Harpoon missiles fired from US Patrol Squadrons VP-5 and VP-40. After nearly 6 hours of being pounded by anti-ship cruise missiles and air dropped bombs, &quot;Anchorage&quot; would not sink and the , was called in to finish the job. One well-placed torpedo lifted the ship out of the water and broke her keel. Nearly 22 minutes later, &quot;Anchorage&quot; slipped beneath the waves completing the final stage of the RIMPAC 2010 SINKEX.

<text>&quot;Excellence in Broadcasting&quot; is the second episode of the ninth season of the animated comedy series &quot;Family Guy&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on October 3, 2010. The episode features anthropomorphic dog Brian, an adamant liberal, confronting conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh at a book signing in Quahog, and ultimately having a political change of heart when Limbaugh persuades him to read his latest book. Brian soon decides to become a devoted member of the Republican Party, and soon begins criticizing liberals. This leads Brian to become roommates with Limbaugh, and begin following him everywhere; Limbaugh eventually gets annoyed and ends up disclosing Brian&#x27;s true political convictions.

The episode was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by John Holmquist. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to receiving both praise and criticism from conservative news outlets. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.94 million homes in its original airing. As well as Limbaugh, the episode featured guest performances by Gary Cole, Christine Lakin, Phil LaMarr, Shelley Long, Nana Visitor and Rainn Wilson, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. &quot;Excellence in Broadcasting&quot; was released on DVD along with three other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.

==Plot==
In light of &quot;And Then There Were Fewer&quot;, the Griffins are watching the news—where Tom Tucker casually reveals that Diane Simmons committed the murders at James Woods&#x27; mansion and is now dead. Free of the false charges she tried to frame him for, he then introduces Diane&#x27;s successor, Joyce Kinney. As Lois reads the newspaper, she discovers that conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh is holding a book signing in Quahog. Chris is confused as he thought Rush Limbaugh was secretly Fred Savage, which Lois herself reported when she worked for Fox in &quot;Fox-y Lady&quot; only for Lois to explain that anything reported on Fox News either is or becomes a lie, even if it&#x27;s the truth. Enraged, Brian, who despises Limbaugh over his political beliefs, decides to confront him at the signing. There, Limbaugh is criticized by Brian, but he counters by asking him whether he has read any of his books, leaving Brian dumbfounded and angry. As he curses Limbaugh to himself on his way home, Brian is mugged by a gang; Limbaugh abruptly shows up and beats them all to rescue Brian. Thankful, Brian agrees to read four pages of Limbaugh&#x27;s book. This he does, but Brian grows interested enough to continue reading the book overnight. By then, he becomes a conservative Republican. Lois questions Brian&#x27;s conviction, citing his past liberalism, while Brian defends his ability to change his mind based on new information. Lois points out that Brian purposefully disagrees with the general consensus on many things just so he can feel like &quot;the smartest guy in the room&quot; and accuses him of being a contrarian rather than a genuine believer; for example, he hated &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; but defends the movie &quot;Cocktail&quot;. Brian meets with Limbaugh to thank him for helping his political conversion, and the two travel to the Republican National Headquarters, where they are greeted by former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain.

Returning home, Lois is unimpressed when Brian tells her that Limbaugh will be coming over for dinner. That night, Lois begins arguing and challenging Limbaugh politically—with Peter joining in as well. She then accuses Limbaugh of brainwashing Brian, and demands that their dog go back to the way he used to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on &quot;The Company Way&quot;, &quot;Republican Town&quot;. Brian, outraged by Lois&#x27;s unsupportive behavior, decides to move out and become roommates with Limbaugh—who reluctantly allows him to move into his house. Brian soon begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces many of Limbaugh&#x27;s possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Brian then proceeds to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, where he attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. This frustrates Limbaugh, who ends up having Brian thrown out. Despite this, Brian continues to try and prove his devotion to the conservative cause by waterboarding Pelosi—only to end up getting apprehended and sent to jail.

Later on, Limbaugh bails out Brian, but he grows annoyed when Brian again tries to assert his conservatism. This prompts Limbaugh to tell Brian he is only fighting against the Establishment due to his desire of being the underdog. He proves his point by telling Brian that a child was executed in Texas, causing Brian to be visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian&#x27;s honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Limbaugh leaves the jail, making a &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;-like pledge to &quot;be around&quot; wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance before waving goodbye to the other. The episode ends with Brian watching Limbaugh transform into a bald eagle and subsequently flying away into the skyline.

==Production and development==

First announced by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane in an interview on August 13, 2009, the episode was written by series regular Patrick Meighan, and directed by series regular John Holmquist shortly after the conclusion of the production of the eighth season. In the interview, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, MacFarlane conceded that &quot;Family Guy&quot; tends to be very liberal because &quot;it&#x27;s written by liberals&quot;. In choosing the conservatives who would be featured in the episode, MacFarlane stated, &quot;we put it out there to a lot of Republicans—&#x27;we&#x27;re doing this show, who wants in?&#x27;—and we got some bites.&quot; Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising director, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Elaine Ko and Spencer Porter serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for &quot;Excellence in Broadcasting&quot;. It is the first episode to feature a high-definition opening credit sequence.

On &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; on September 27, 2010, Limbaugh explained that he agreed to do the episode based on his continuing friendly relationship with &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, commenting, &quot;Seth appreciates and has a great affection for professionals, and we&#x27;re all professionals here.&quot; Limbaugh went on to reveal that he was in the studio&#x27;s sound booth for &quot;three or four days at four hours at a time,&quot; while recording his lines for the episode, as well as for the accompanying musical number, which Limbaugh admitted to being something of a challenge. Later on his radio show, Limbaugh went on to criticize 20th Century Fox&#x27;s public relations department, following a comment by author and commentator Andrew Breitbart, accusing the Fox Broadcasting Company of &quot;burying&quot; the episode. Limbaugh also admitted, however, that &quot;there was nothing in the script that would want them to edit out.&quot;

&quot;Excellence in Broadcasting&quot;, along with two other episodes from &quot;Family Guy&quot;″s ninth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on December 13, 2011. The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating &quot;And Then There Were Fewer&quot;, a mini-feature entitled &quot;The Comical Adventures of &quot;Family Guy&quot; – Brian &amp; Stewie: The Lost Phone Call&quot;, and footage of the &quot;Family Guy&quot; panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con.

In addition to the regular cast and Limbaugh, actor Gary Cole, actress Christine Lakin, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actress Shelley Long, actress Nana Visitor and actor Rainn Wilson guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Chris Cox, actor Ralph Garman, and writers Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, John Viener and Wellesley Wild also made minor appearances.

&quot;Family Guy&quot; series producer Kara Vallow is not credited in this episode. According to an Instagram post Vallow made following Limbaugh&#x27;s death in 2021, she had her name removed in protest.

==Cultural references==

In the opening scene of the episode, the Griffin family are shown watching the syndicated television show &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, with Mike and Carol Brady then appearing in bed with one another. After Lois discovers that Limbaugh will be appearing at a book signing in Quahog, Chris references a previous episode, &quot;FOX-y Lady&quot;, in which Limbaugh appeared as a character created by actor Fred Savage, which was subsequently reported on by Lois for Fox News. The episode featured a brief cameo appearance of conservative character Stan Smith from Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s second show, &quot;American Dad!&quot;.

The scene of Limbaugh rescuing Brian is an almost shot-for-shot homage to the scene of Mr. Miyagi rescuing Daniel in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. Returning home after being saved by Limbaugh, Brian begins watching the NBC comedy series &quot;The Office&quot;, featuring actor and comedian Rainn Wilson. Deciding to thank Limbaugh for his newfound conservatism, Brian is taken by Limbaugh to the National Republican Party headquarters in Washington, D.C., in order to meet former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain from Arizona. McCain then recalls when he and Limbaugh solved mysteries together. A parody of the animated television series &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; is then shown, including McCain and Limbaugh capturing United States Congressman Barney Frank from Massachusetts, disguised as a mummy.

After deciding to sing a song entitled &quot;Republicantown,&quot; several political figures are shown and parodied, including former Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney and former Presidents of the United States Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Actors Mickey Rourke, Chuck Norris and Jon Voight also appear, while Voight&#x27;s &quot;pretty hot at one time&quot; daughter is Angelina Jolie. The song &quot;Republicantown&quot; is a parody of the song &quot;The Company Way&quot; from the musical &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Excellence in Broadcasting&quot; was broadcast on October 3, 2010, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s spin-off, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, and followed by the 100th episode of &quot;American Dad!&quot;. It was watched by 7.94 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; on ABC, the season premiere of &quot;Undercover Boss&quot; on CBS and &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; on NBC. The episode also acquired a 3.9 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership. The episode&#x27;s ratings decreased significantly from the show&#x27;s season premiere.

Television critics reacted mostly mixed to &quot;Excellence in Broadcasting&quot;, calling the storyline &quot;funny,&quot; but &quot;toothless.&quot; In a simultaneous review of the episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; that preceded the show, and the broadcast of &quot;American Dad!&quot; that followed it, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Rowan Kaiser noted, &quot;most of the episode was spent justifying its existence as a Rush Limbaugh episode of Family Guy,&quot; and that the episode &quot;failed to do that.&quot; In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised &quot;Family Guy&quot; for its past political humor, but ultimately rated it as a D, the second worst rating, behind &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Loan-a Lisa&quot; and the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;100 A.D.&quot;, beating only &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;&#x27;s F-grade episode &quot;Cleveland Live!&quot;. In a slightly more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised Limbaugh&#x27;s appearance in the episode, commenting Limbaugh &quot;certainly deserves credit for his willingness to participate and lend his own voice.&quot; Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode&#x27;s debut of the high-definition opening sequence, and its introduction of Joyce Kinney as a replacement for news anchor Diane Simmons, who was killed off in &quot;And Then There Were Fewer.&quot; Adam Markovitz of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;The show definitely skewered Brian’s hardcore conservative conversion, but overall it seemed like a pretty fair fight.&quot;

Limbaugh&#x27;s appearance in the episode has drawn both praise and criticism from news outlets, including Daniel Foster of &quot;National Review&quot; who commented, &quot;It is to Mr. Limbaugh&#x27;s credit that he can make fun of himself. But Seth MacFarlane, the whiskey-soaked Dada creator of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, is responsible for more sophomoric cartooning than the combined patrons of America’s truck stop and dive bar bathrooms.&quot; Foster went on to add, &quot;I can only look at the Limbaugh-MacFarlane mash-up with a wary eye.&quot; Columnist Matt Lewis of &quot;Politics Daily&quot; also questioned Limbaugh&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Family Guy&quot;, citing his support for former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, whose daughter, Bristol Palin, has openly criticized MacFarlane and called the show&#x27;s writers &quot;heartless jerks.&quot; In contrast, John Nolte of Andrew Breitbart&#x27;s &quot;Big Hollywood&quot; wrote, &quot;What MacFarlane’s doing fits exactly into our template. He’s entitled to his opinion, worked very hard to reach the top of the most difficult business there is to succeed in, and in turn uses that forum to further his own agenda—that’s how it’s supposed to work. But at the same time he doesn’t completely shut us out.&quot; Prior to the episode&#x27;s official broadcast on television in the United States, Jarett Wieselman of the &quot;New York Post&quot; called Limbaugh&#x27;s guest appearance in the episode &quot;genuinely funny,&quot; and David Weigel of &quot;Slate&quot; commented, &quot;I&#x27;m not at all surprised that Limbaugh would embrace the show and answer its mockery of conservatives; the plotline is a perfect conservative narrative.&quot;

<text>The Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device or MUSTARD, usually written as Mustard, was a reusable launch system concept that was explored by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) during the mid-1960s.

Mustard was intended to operate as a multistage rocket, the individual stages comprising near-identical spaceplane modules. These planes, or stages, were hypersonic vehicles, capable of flying at speeds in excess of five times the speed of sound. Following a vertically standing launch, each stage was to progressively separate during the ascent, after which they would individually fly back towards a suitable landing strip. The final spaceplane was to be capable of attaining such an altitude that it would be able to achieve a sub-orbital trajectory before also performing a controlled return. Following a conventional landing, all of the stages were intended to be reused multiple times. It was projected that Mustard was suitable for launching payloads weighing as much as into orbit.

The concept originated from studies performed by British manufacturing conglomerate English Electric, who had drawn inspiration from an American proposal, the Douglas Astro, which was proposed in 1962. Throughout the 1960s, the Mustard project was refined and prepared for programme launch. However, financing for the initiative was not forthcoming from the British government and the concept ultimately languished following the completion of the last major design study in early 1967. According to BAC&#x27;s successor company BAE Systems, the projected cost of completing Mustard&#x27;s development had been estimated as being between 20 and 30 times cheaper than the conventional expendable launch system used for the American Apollo program. The knowledge and expertise from Mustard was applied in various other avenues, the most prominent being the HOTOL spaceplane programme during the 1980s.

==History==
===Origins===
During the 1940s and 1950s, the United Kingdom had undertaken numerous independent space-related ventures, such as the Black Knight ballistic missile programme and the abortive Black Arrow satellite launcher. While the ambitions of these programmes had been tempered both by cost and a political desire to collaborate with other Commonwealth and Western nations, such as the Europa launcher, Britain retained a considerable interest in the pursuit of various space-related technologies. The field of re-usable space vehicles was no exception to this interest, British manufacturing conglomerate English Electric had undertaken preliminary work on the topic at their facility in Warton, Lancashire, as part of a government-sponsored series of wider studies into high-speed vehicles and sub-orbital spaceplanes. During 1960, the aerospace activities of English Electric merged with those of multiple other firms in the formation of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). The new entity continued its sponsored research into these concepts.

According to author Nigel Henbest, one of BAC&#x27;s research teams, headed by engineer Tom Smith, Chief of the Aerospace Department at BAC, that was initially investigating supersonic and hypersonic flight problems, became interested in the application of such a vehicle for space-related activities. The team compared their performance estimates of a winged reusable launch vehicle against conventional multistage rockets, determining that the approach was not cost-effective, largely due to it requiring different rockets to power each stage. Instead, by simplifying the launcher to use near-identical winged vehicles, considerable cost savings would then be achievable both in terms of its development and manufacture. Associated costs would have been further reduced by all of the elements being reusable and without any need for post-mission refurbishment, only requiring refuelling. Furthermore, the scale of the vehicles could be increased or decreased to produce launch vehicles to suit virtually any weight and thrust requirements.

It has been claimed that from an early stage, BAC&#x27;s space-related research was being influenced by foreign space programmes, most significant of these being the United States; reportedly, the company engaged in detailed studies of various transatlantic projects and proposals. One particular proposed vehicle, the Douglas Astro, is said to have impressed British researchers; around the beginning of 1964, the Astro was adopted as a conceptual starting point for BAC&#x27;s own clustered design, which the company came to refer to as the &quot;Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device&quot; or &quot;MUSTARD&quot;; however, in common parlance, this moniker was usually written simply as &quot;Mustard&quot;. In the most intensely-studied design, Mustard was to have weighed roughly 420 tonnes prior to launch, and be capable of delivering a payload of three tonnes into a geostationary earth orbit (GEO).

===Stall and termination===
During 1964, the design of Mustard had reached the point where it was effectively complete. However, Smith acknowledges that in order to have continued the project through to the manufacturing stage, several billion pounds of investment would have been required, the financing of which was neither budgeted nor planned for by any entity. Writing for the scientific periodical &quot;New Scientist&quot;, author Nigel Henbest commented that it was unlikely that Britain could pursue the development of Mustard alone, but also suggested that there was potential value for the platform if organised as a multinational European venture, similar to the conventional Europa and Ariane launchers.

In early 1967, the last major design study on the topic was drawn up, after which the project was continued at a lower level until work on Mustard was finally terminated in 1970 by the British government, who had decided to participate in the new American post-Apollo project instead. Accordingly, a number of key Mustard project staff had spent the first two years of the 1970s overseas at North American Rockwell, where they contributed to the initial study which would eventually lead to the US Space Shuttle. Around this time, the prospect of collaboration is said to have faded and, in the absence of significant interest from the British government, the Mustard project was effectively terminated.

In early 1977, BAC was itself later merged with rival Hawker Siddeley to form British Aerospace (B.Ae) and when the reusable HOTOL spaceplane project arose in 1984, the project team was relocated to Warton, where they took advantage of the expertise that had been accumulated during the earlier Mustard project. Writing of Mustard&#x27;s cancellation, Henbest wrote that the absence of &quot;political courage&quot; had been largely responsible for the failure of the venture to become reality; furthermore, if further research had been financed by the Ministry of Aviation, then Britain may have been able to play a larger role in other space programmes, such as the American Space Shuttle.

==Design==
===Modules===
Mustard was a modular reusable space launch system, comprising multiple copies of a single vehicle design, each of which was configured for a different role as a booster stage or an orbital spaceplane. The core vehicle design resembled the basic layout of the Douglas Astro, both being delta-winged reusable vehicles, as would the later American Space Shuttle. Furthermore, all three functioned as vertically launched rockets and used integral wings so that they could land horizontally, akin to an aeroplane.

The design evolved through a total of fifteen proposed variants or schemes, each typically comprising a deep-keeled lifting-body airframe with delta wings in a smooth blended wing body layout, with twin tail fins rising from the wing tips and canted outwards. Some early variants featured a compound-delta wing, complete with inboard tail fins. Power was provided by an arrangement of between one and four rocket engines positioned upon the rear fuselage. Due to the relatively low re-entry speed anticipated, it was believed that complex heat-resistant tiling could be dispensed with in favour of simpler and cheaper nickel-alloy panelling across the vehicle&#x27;s underside. Mustard was to be crewed by between three and six astronauts.

Operationally, there were two primary vehicle configurations, the orbiter and booster stages, respectively. The orbiter vehicle, which carried the desired payload, featured ducting to receive fuel from the boosters, while the booster units incorporated systems for transferring fuel across to the orbiter vehicle or between one another. In this fashion, the orbiter could remain fully topped-up for its long orbital injection flight, while all the vehicles could still share a standardised fuel tank design. According to Smith, the orbiting vehicle would have been capable of performing between 30 and 50 launches before needing to be replaced, while the booster engines, which wouldn&#x27;t have been subject to as much heat and stress, would have remained usable for up to 200 times.

===Clustering and stacking===
Various clustering and stacking arrangements were explored. Where the Astro would have launched as a two-stage step-rocket, for which the booster would have been much larger than the orbiter, Mustard comprised from three to five near-identically sized modules. Early studies focused on a vehicle with a shallow 120° &quot;vee&quot; underside to both body and wings so that three could be clustered in a triangle. Some included a fourth, orbital vehicle mounted on top of three boosters. The most efficient regime was to empty one booster at a time, keeping the others topped up for as long as possible, so that the first-stage booster could be dropped as soon as possible. The three boosters would be emptied in turn. But this led to an asymmetric mass loading which BAC believed to be a significant problem, so later designs used a sideways stacking system in which flatter modules were stacked more like sheets of paper.

At , at around 30 nautical miles, the last of the booster units would separate; once clear, these units would glide downwards and land upon a runway similar to conventional aircraft, allowing for their reuse. The spacecraft would place its payload into orbit at around 1,000 nautical miles, which would be achieved roughly 10 minutes after launch, and then return to Earth via a controlled gliding descent before conducting a landing in a similar fashion to the booster units. Originally, it was envisioned that all three vehicles would be crewed, however, when commenting during the mid-1980s, Smith observed that, due to technological advances, it would be possible for the booster units to be entirely automated using existing technology.

<text>Thomas Dougal &quot;Tam&quot; Paton (5 August 1938 – 8 April 2009) was a pop group manager, most notably of the Scottish boy band the Bay City Rollers, and convicted child sex offender.

==Biography==
Born in Prestonpans, Scotland, 
he was the son of a potato merchant. Paton initially drove a truck to aid the Bay City Rollers financially. He guided the band through to their period of success during the mid-1970s, nurturing their image of being the &quot;boys next door&quot;. He was responsible for beginning a myth that the band members preferred drinking milk to alcohol, in order to cultivate a clean, innocent image. However, vocalist Les McKeown later said Paton introduced the band members to drugs. &quot;When we got a wee bit tired, he&#x27;d give us amphetamines,&quot; McKeown recalled in 2005. &quot;He&#x27;d keep us awake with speed, black bombers. You end up almost showing off to each other what stupid drugs you&#x27;ve taken.&quot;

In 1979, Paton was fired as manager, and subsequently developed a multi-million-pound real estate business based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

In the late 1970s Paton managed the band Rosetta Stone, and had a romantic relationship with the guitarist Paul Lerwill, who later changed his name to Gregory Gray.

In his autobiography &quot;I Ran With The Gang: My Life In And Out Of The Bay City Rollers&quot; (2018), Alan Longmuir suggests Paton benefited from friendships with politicians, police officers and senior members of the justiciary, and wrote of his fears that more will emerge about Paton that will show “his depravity ran deeper than we currently know”.

Longmuir states:
==Criminal convictions and child sex abuse allegations==
Paton, who was openly gay, was involved in a number of legal controversies. In 1982 he was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to the sexual abuse of 10 boys over a three-year period. 

He was arrested on child sexual abuse charges in January 2003, but was later cleared of all allegations. In April 2004, Paton was convicted of supplying cannabis and fined £200,000. In 2003, he was accused of trying to rape the Bay City Rollers guitarist Pat McGlynn, in a hotel room in 1977. The police decided there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution.

In 2016, Bay City Rollers singer Les McKeown accused Paton of raping him. In the documentary &quot;Secrets of the Bay City Rollers&quot; (2023):

In 2023, Gert Magnus, who had lived at a children&#x27;s home, claimed that Paton blackmailed him into taking other youngsters to his house so he could sexually abuse them. In the 1970s Magnus had lived at Paton&#x27;s Little Kellerstain home near Edinburgh, and had been told by Paton that, if he procured other boys for him from care homes, he would stop raping him. While at Paton&#x27;s house, he said, &quot;There were always parties and lots of young boys and lots of producers... Going to the room and coming out. Big party.&quot; He also recalled Jimmy Savile being present. &quot;I was so young. And I thought that&#x27;s normal in this business,&quot; he said. The band&#x27;s original singer Nobby Clarke elsewhere said that Paton once told him the band would get better promotion on BBC Radio 1 if a member slept with DJ Chris Denning, who was later convicted of paedophilia.

In October 2022 John Wilson was convicted of sexually assaulting children, with Paton, at Paton&#x27;s home.

==Death==
Paton died of a suspected heart attack aged 70 at his Edinburgh home on 8 April 2009. At the time of his death he weighed . On the night of his death, drugs and cash worth £1.5m were stolen from his house.
