<doc id="869096" wikidata="Q246505" url="?curid=869096" title="Culture of Hungary">
<text>[[Hungary|Hungarian]] culture is characterized by its distinctive cuisine, folk traditions, poetry, theatre, religious customs, music and traditional embroidered garments. Hungarian folklore traditions include tales, music, dance, decorated pottery, carvings and embroidery. Historically, Hungarian music has largely consisted of folk music and classical and baroque pieces. Hungary shares cultural similarities with its neighbouring countries as well as with Turkic nations in Asia, the latter stemming from a history of interaction between Hungarians and Turkic peoples. Noted Hungarian authors include Sándor Márai, Imre Kertész, Péter Esterházy, Magda Szabó and János Kodolányi. Imre Kertész is particularly noteworthy for having won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2002.

==Music==


Hungarian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity and continues to play a major part in the country’s music. It retains Turkic influences and tends to have a strong dactylic rhythm due to the Hungarian language consistently putting stress on the first syllable of each word.

Prominent Hungarian classical music composers include Franz Liszt, Franz Schmidt, Leó Weiner, Ernő Dohnányi, Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, György Ligeti, Miklós Rózsa. Hungary also has a number of renowned composers of contemporary classical music including György Kurtág, Péter Eötvös and Zoltán Jeney, among others.

Franz Liszt spoke no Hungarian until 1870, when he started to learn the language, but clearly identified himself as Hungarian and founded the Academy of Music. Béla Bartók was also born in the former Kingdom of Hungary. György Ligeti was born in Transylvania, after the region was transferred to Romania. Both György Ligeti and Béla Bartók studied at the Liszt Academy before moving abroad, where a large portion of their work was written.
Broughton claims that Hungary&#x27;s &quot;infectious sound has been surprisingly influential on neighbouring countries (thanks perhaps to the common Austro-Hungarian history) and it&#x27;s not uncommon to hear Hungarian-sounding tunes in Romania, and Slovakia. The Busójárás carnival in Mohács is a major Hungarian folk music event, formerly featuring the long-established and well-regarded Bogyiszló orchestra.

Hungarian classical music has long been an &quot;experiment, made from Hungarian antedecents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture [using the] musical world of the folk song&quot;. Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions, so that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style. For example, Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, two of Hungary&#x27;s most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their music. Bartók collected folk songs from across Central Europe, including Romania and Slovakia, whilst Kodály was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style.

During the era of Communist rule in Hungary (1944–1989), a Song Committee examined and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity. Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of jazz such as trumpeter Rudolf Tomsits, pianist-composer Károly Binder, and in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, Ferenc Sebő and Márta Sebestyén. Hungary has had several popular rock bands such as Illés (with creating the hungarian rock music), Metró, or Omega.

==Architecture==

Hungary is home to:

* Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe, and the second largest in the world after the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem in Israel
* Széchenyi Medicinal Bath, the largest medicinal bath in Europe
* Esztergom Basilica, the third-largest church in Europe
* Pannonhalma Archabbey, the second-largest territorial abbey in the world
* Gödöllő, the second-largest Baroque castle in the world 
* Pécs, the largest Myles Necropolis outside Italy

==Literature==


In earliest times, the Hungarian language was written in a runic-like script (). The country switched to the Latin alphabet after being Christianized under the reign of Stephen I of Hungary (1000–1038). There are no existing documents from before the 11th century.

The oldest written record in Hungarian is a fragment in the Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany (1055) which, while mostly written in Latin, contains several Hungarian terms, among them the words &quot;feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea&quot;, &quot;up the military road to Fehérvár&quot;. The oldest complete text is the Funeral Sermon and Prayer &quot;(Halotti beszéd és könyörgés)&quot; (1192–1195), a translation of a Latin sermon. The oldest poem is the Old Hungarian Laments of Mary &quot;(Ómagyar Mária-siralom)&quot;, also a translation from Latin, albeit a flawed one, from the 13th century. It is also the oldest surviving Uralic poem.

Among the first chronicles of Hungarian history were &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the Hungarians&quot;) by the unknown author usually called &quot;Anonymus&quot; , and &quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians&quot;) by Simon Kézai, both written in Latin. These chronicles are a blend of history and legends, so they are not always historically accurate. Another chronicle is the &quot;Képes krónika&quot; (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for Louis the Great.

Renaissance literature flourished under the reign of king Matthias Corvinus (1458–1490). Janus Pannonius—even though he wrote in Latin—is considered one of the most important writers in Hungarian literature; he was also the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was founded during Matthias&#x27; reign by András Hess in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the &quot;Chronica Hungarorum&quot;.

Matthias Corvinus&#x27; library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was among Europe&#x27;s greatest collections of secular historical chronicles and philosophical and scientific works in the 15th century. In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de Medici had founded his own Greek-Latin library after being inspired by the example of the Hungarian king. Matthias Corvinus&#x27; library is now part of UNESCO World Heritage. Two other important figures of the Hungarian Renaissance are poets Bálint Balassi and Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos.

The most important poets of the period following the reign of King Matthias were Bálint Balassi (1554–1594) and Miklós Zrínyi (1620–1664). Balassi&#x27;s poetry, reflecting medieval influences, can be divided into three groups: love poems, war poems, and religious poems. Zrínyi&#x27;s most significant work, the epic &quot;Szigeti veszedelem&quot; (&quot;Peril of Sziget&quot;, 1648–49) is written in a fashion similar to the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In the poem Zrínyi recounts the heroic Battle of Szigetvár where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetvár. Among religious works, the most important is the Bible translation by Gáspár Károli, the Protestant pastor of Gönc, which was completed in 1590. This translation is called the &quot;Bible of Vizsoly&quot; after the town where it was first published. (See Hungarian Bible translations for more details.)

The Hungarian enlightenment followed about fifty years after the Western European enlightenment, reaching Hungary through Vienna. The first writers of the Hungarian enlightenment were, among others, Maria Theresa&#x27;s bodyguards György Bessenyei and János Batsányi. The greatest poets of this period were Mihály Csokonai Vitéz and Dániel Berzsenyi. The enlightenment prompted a reform of the Hungarian language. The greatest figure in this reform was Ferenc Kazinczy. Beginning at that time, Hungarian became useful for scientific writing, and many words were coined to name new inventions.

Hungarian literature has recently gained renown outside the borders of Hungary, mostly through German, French and English translations. Some modern Hungarian authors have become popular in Germany and Italy, especially Sándor Márai, Péter Esterházy, Péter Nádas, and Imre Kertész. Kertész is a contemporary Jewish writer and Holocaust survivor who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2002.

The classics of Hungarian literature have remained largely unknown outside Hungary. János Arany, a famous 19th-century poet, is still much loved in Hungary, especially his collection of ballads. Arany is among several other &quot;true classics&quot; including Sándor Petőfi, the poet of the Revolution of 1848, Endre Ady, Mihály Babits, Dezső Kosztolányi, Attila József, and János Pilinszky. Other Hungarian authors are Ferenc Móra, Géza Gárdonyi, Zsigmond Móricz, Gyula Illyés, Albert Wass, and Magda Szabó. Vilmos Kondor has created a new trend in recent years, and is mentioned as the creator of Hungarian noir (see &quot;Budapest Noir&quot;).

==Film==
Many Hungarians have contributed to film art and its technology, but, due to political reasons, many of them found it was easier to find success abroad. As of 2018, Hungarians working in Hollywood and some in Hungary had received more than 150 Academy Award nominations and about 46 Academy Awards. Already in the 1930s there were 17 Hungarian nominations, but the peak was in the decade of the 1940s when about 51 nominations and 13 to 15 Academy Awards were given to exiled Hungarians. The best year was 1944 with 9 to 10 nominations and four (Michael Curtiz, Paul Lukas, George Pal, and William S. Darling) Academy Awards.
The first Hungarian to be nominated was Lajos Bíró (1929) and the first to win the award was William S. Darling (1933). Art Direction might be the most successful category concerning wins/nominations: Paul Groesse 3/11, William S. Darling 3/7, Joseph Kish 1/5, Vincent Korda 1/4, Alexandre Trauner 1/2 and Marcel Vertès 1/1.
The number of nominees and awards in all categories, exceeds all other nations, counted per capita.

Hungarians emigrated in large numbers after several disasters following the First World War (1918) when neighbouring countries—Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia—occupied parts of the former Kingdom of Hungary, which lost two-thirds of its territory in a 1920 treaty. There was a brief communist takeover accompanied by a so-called ″red terror″ and then a reaction against it called the ″white terror″, which disrupted the economy. At that time Hungarian filmmakers tried their fortunes abroad, first, as did Géza von Bolváry, in the German-speaking world and later in the English-speaking world. Film with sound was invented (1918) in Germany by Dénes Mihály. Béla Gáspár invented, 1932, the first full color one-strip film: Gasparcolor patented in 1933. With the advent of racial laws in 1939, Jewish citizens were forced to leave the country to find work. It is ironic that some of the most successful propaganda films during the Second World War for both sides were directed by Hungarians: &quot;Münchhausen&quot; by Josef von Báky and &quot;&quot;Pimpernel&quot; Smith&quot; by Leslie Howard. With another, longer-lasting, communist takeover in 1948, more Hungarians left. After the crushed 1956 revolution, more important filmmakers left, including Vilmos Zsigmond, László Kovács, Jean Badal and Peter Medak. Following the amnesty of 1960, the cultural climate eased somewhat.
Nevertheless, despite the hardships of staying at home, some Hungarians received Academy Award nominations (21 times for 24 people up to 2018) and in some cases the actual Award (Ferenc Rofusz (1980), István Szabó (1981), Zsuzsa Böszörményi (1991) and co-winners Jászberényi, Perlaki and Priskin (2010), and co-winners Imre Major and Csaba Kőhegyi in 2014. The first Hungarian to be nominated from Hungary was Tamás Czigány, for best short documentary in 1967.

The best-known Hungarian film to date is &quot;Mephisto&quot;, by István Szabó. It won an Academy Award in the category Best Foreign Language film. The year before, in 1980, &quot;The Fly&quot;, an animation by Rofusz, became the very first Hungarian film to receive an Academy Award. The Foreign Student Academy Award went to Zsuzsa Böszörményi (1991). In 2010 the trio Márk Jászberényi, Tamás Perlaki and Gyula Priskin obtained the scientific and engineering award for Lustre, a software program to color-correct intermediates in real time, first used on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In 2014, the same prize went to three Hungarians, Tibor Madjar, Imre Major and Csaba Kőhegyi. Up to 2018, ten films have been nominated in the category Best Foreign Language Film: four nominations to István Szabó (the most nominated person in Hungary), two to Zoltán Fábri (1969, 1979) and one each to Imre Gyöngyössy, Barna Kabay and Károly Makk, and &quot;On Body and Soul&quot; (2018). Three films have been nominated for Best Short Animation (Marcell Jankovics, Ferenc Rófusz and Géza M. Tóth). Cinematographer Lajos Koltai has been nominated for best cinematography in 2000. In 2016, &quot;Son of Saul&quot; won the second Best Foreign Language Film AA for Hungary. In 2017 Hungary won the best short feature category with Mindenki. In 2018, Hungary got its 10th nomination in the category Best Foreign Language Film for &quot;On Body and Soul&quot; by Ildikó Enyedi. The most successful film around 2019 is &quot;Eternal Winter&quot; by Atilla Szász. &quot;Those Who Remained&quot; was shortlisted for Best Foreign film 2020.

====Czechoslovakia====
Ján Kadár (b. János Kadár) won the first AA for Czechoslovakia (1965).

====Canada====
Paul Sarossy is active often as Atom Egoyan&#x27;s cinematographer.

====Hungary====
Some years after the failed revolution of 1956 against the Soviet-dominated communist dictatorship, the cultural climate eased slightly; this led to more creative freedom. Important films in the 1960s were directed by István Gaál: (&quot;The Falcons&quot;), András Kovács: &quot;Hideg Napok&quot; (1966), Miklós Jancsó: &quot;The Round-Up&quot; (1965) (Screenplay: Hernádi Gyula, DOP: Tamás Somló), and István Szabó (&quot;The Father&quot;). Márton Keleti directed: &quot;Franz Liszt: Dreams of Love&quot;. (1970) filmed in 70 mm by István Hildebrandt. Other important filmmakers Sándor Pál, Márta Mészáros (&quot;Adoption&quot; Golden Bear Berlin 1975), Péter Gothár (Golden Lion, Venice): &quot;Time Stands Still&quot; (Cannes: Award of the Youth, 1982) (1982). &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Children of Glory&quot; are successful bigger budget movies about Hungary&#x27;s turbulent past. Recent successful films include: János Szász: (Witman fiúk, DOP: Tibor Máthé 1997), György Pálfi: &quot;Hukkle&quot; (2002), (&quot;Taxidermia&quot;) (2006). The first super-studio in Hungary was Korda Studios. The next was Raleigh Studios, Budapest. Partly because of this an increasing number of foreign films, mainly with larger budgets, have been shot in Hungary in recent years, especially in Budapest. Budapest has been nicknamed &quot;Hollywood on the Danube&quot; because it is arguably now the most Hollywood-populated place outside the U.S. Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Munich&quot; was also partly shot in Budapest. Most of Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s &quot;Hellboy II&quot; was shot in Hungary. Altogether 47 foreign films were shot in Hungary in 2008, and 52 in 2009. In comparison, about 20 to 30 Hungarian movies are made annually.

=== Art movies ===
Hungarians were major pioneers in cinema both in Europe (e.g. Alexander Korda) and in the United States, and they have entered to the formation of the art movie.

István Szőts People of the Mountains won the Venice Biennale in 1942, then Géza Radványi Somewhere in Europe influenced the emerging neorealism.

After World War II the greatest Hungarian film director was Miklós Jancsó who won the first two international film prizes:
* &quot;The Round-Up&quot; (Szegénylegények), Locarno, FIPRESCI, 1965
* &quot;Red Psalm&quot; (&quot;Még kér a nép&quot; Sándor Petőfi), Cannes, Best Director Award, 1971

==Cuisine==


Traditional dishes such as the world-famous Goulash (&quot;gulyás&quot; stew or &quot;gulyásleves&quot; soup) are popular. Dishes are often flavoured with paprika (ground red peppers), a Hungarian innovation. Thick, heavy Hungarian sour cream called &quot;tejföl&quot; is often used to soften the dish&#x27;s flavour. The famous Hungarian hot river fish soup called Fisherman&#x27;s soup or &quot;halászlé&quot; is usually a rich mixture of several kinds of poached fish.

Other dishes include chicken paprikash, &quot;foie gras&quot; made of goose liver, &quot;pörkölt&quot; stew, &quot;vadas&quot; (game stew with vegetable gravy and dumplings), trout with almonds or salty and sweet dumplings, and &quot;túrós csusza&quot;, (dumplings with fresh quark cheese and thick sour cream). Desserts include the iconic Dobos Cake, Strudel (&quot;rétes&quot;), filled with apple, cherry, poppy seeds or cheese, Gundel pancake, plum dumplings (&quot;szilvás gombóc&quot;), &quot;somlói dumplings&quot;, dessert soups like chilled sour cherry soup, and sweet chestnut puree (&quot;gesztenyepüré&quot;) (cooked chestnuts mashed with sugar and rum, split into crumbs, and topped with whipped cream). &quot;Perec&quot; and &quot;kifli&quot; are widely popular pastries.

The &quot;csárda&quot; is the most distinctive type of Hungarian inn, an old-style tavern offering traditional cuisine and beverages. &quot;Borozó&quot; usually denotes a cozy old-fashioned wine tavern, &quot;pince&quot; is a beer or wine cellar, and a &quot;söröző&quot; is a pub offering draught beer and sometimes meals. The &quot;bisztró&quot; is an inexpensive restaurant often with self-service. The &quot;büfé&quot; is the cheapest place, although one may have to eat standing at a counter. Pastries, cake, and coffee are served at a &quot;cukrászda&quot;, while an &quot;eszpresszó&quot; is a cafeteria.

===Alcoholic beverages===
Pálinka: Pálinka is a fruit brandy, distilled from fruit grown in the orchards of the Great Hungarian Plain. It is a spirit native to Hungary, and comes in a variety of flavours including apricot (&quot;barack&quot;) and cherry (&quot;cseresznye&quot;). However, plum (&quot;szilva&quot;) is the most common flavour. Though many flavours are available, pálinka made of strawberries or walnut are considered to be a rare and expensive delicacy; variations also include pálinka sweetened with honey or fruit beds under the liquid.

Beer: Beer goes well with many traditional Hungarian dishes. The five main Hungarian breweries are Borsodi, Soproni, Arany Ászok, Kőbányai, and Dreher.

Wine: As Hugh Johnson says in &quot;The History of Wine&quot;, the territory of Hungary is ideal for wine-making. Since the fall of communism, there has been a renaissance of Hungarian wine-making. The choice of good wine is widening from year to year. The country can be divided to six wine regions, which include North-Transdanubia, Lake Balaton, South Pannonia, Duna-region or &quot;Alföld&quot;, Upper Hungary and Tokaj-Hegyalja. Hungarian wine regions offer a great variety of style, of which the main products of the country are elegant and full-bodied dry whites with good acidity, although complex sweet whites (&quot;Tokaj&quot;), elegant (Eger) and full-bodied robust reds (Villány and Szekszárd). The main varieties are Olaszrizling, Hárslevelű, Furmint, Pinot gris or &quot;Szürkebarát&quot;, Chardonnay (whites), Kékfrankos (or &quot;Blaufrankisch&quot; in German), Kadarka, Portugieser, Zweigelt, Cabernet sauvignon, Cabernet franc, and Merlot. The most famous wines from Hungary are Tokaji Aszú and Egri Bikavér.

Tokaji: &quot;Tokaji&quot;, meaning &quot;of/from Tokaj&quot;, is used to label wines from the wine region of Tokaj-Hegyalja. Tokaji wine has received accolades from numerous great writers and composers including Beethoven, Liszt, Schubert, and Goethe; Joseph Haydn&#x27;s favorite wine was a Tokaji. Louis XV and Frederick the Great tried to outdo one another in the excellence of the vintages they stocked, when they treated guests like Voltaire to some Tokaji. Napoleon III, the last Emperor of the French, ordered 30–40 barrels of Tokaji for the Court every year. Gustav III, King of Sweden, never had any other wine to drink. In Russia, customers included Peter the Great and Empress Elizabeth of Russia.

&quot;Zwack Unicum&quot;: For over 150 years, a blend of 40 Hungarian herbs has been used to create the liqueur Unicum. Unicum is a bitter, dark-coloured liqueur that can be drunk as an &quot;apéritif&quot; or after a meal; it is claimed that this helps the digestion. The recipe is held secret by the Zwack family.

==Spa culture==

Hungary is a land of thermal water. A passion for spa culture and Hungarian history have been connected from the very beginning. It has been shown that Hungarian spa culture is multicultural. The basis of this claim is architecture: Hungarian spas feature Roman, Greek, Turkish, and northern country architectural elements. Due to an advantageous geographical location, thermal water can be found with good quality and in great quantities on over 80% of Hungary&#x27;s territory.

The Romans heralded the first age of the spa in Hungary; remains of their bath complexes are still to be seen in Óbuda. The spa culture was revived during the Turkish Invasion; the Turks used the thermal springs of Buda for the construction of a number of bathhouses, some of which are still functioning (such as Király Baths and Rudas Baths). In the 19th century, advances in deep drilling and medical science provided the springboard for a further leap in bathing culture. Grand spas such as Gellért Baths, Lukács Baths, Margaret Island, and Széchenyi Medicinal Bath are a reflection of this resurgence in popularity. About 1,500 thermal springs can be found in Hungary. About half of these are used for bathing.

The spa culture has a history of nearly 2,000 years in Budapest. Budapest has the richest supply of thermal water among the capitals of the world. There are about 450 public baths in Hungary. Nowadays the trend shows that bath operators are modernizing their facilities and expanding the services offered. A total of 50 of the 160 public baths are qualified as spas throughout the country. Services are offered for healing purposes. These spas provide every type of balneal and physical therapy.

===The wine-growing terroir of Egerszalók===
The spa at Egerszalók is noted for its position in one of the principal wine-growing regions of Hungary. Egerszalók is also notable for human-caused geological morphology: when the spa was expanded by the government in 1961, the flow of supersaturated mineral water sharply increased, leading to the deposition of a hillside of shining white travertine.

===The thermal lake of Hévíz===

Lake Hévíz is the largest biologically active, natural thermal lake in the world. The oldest and most well-known bath of Hungary, in accordance with records from the Roman era, has a history of 2,000 years. The Hévíz treatment, in its present sense, also dates back more than 200 years.

The 4.4 ha (11 acre) lake is fed by its spring rushing up at a depth of 38 m, containing sulphur, radium, and minerals. Due to the high water output of the spring, the water of the lake is completely changed within 48 hours. The water of the lake is equally rich in dissolved substances and gases, combining the favourable effects of naturally carbonated medicinal waters and those containing sulphur, calcium, magnesium, hydrogen-carbonate, as well as those with a slightly radioactive content. The medicinal Hévíz mud, which is unique of its kind, contains both organic and inorganic substances and the radium-salts and reduced sulphuric solutions in it represent special medicinal factors. The temperature of the water is 23–25 °C in winter and 33–36 °C in summer.

==Folk dance==

* Ugrós (Jumping dances): Old style dances dating back to the Middle Ages. Solo or couple dances accompanied by old style music, shepherd and other solo man&#x27;s dances from Transylvania, and marching dances along with remnants of medieval weapon dances belong in this group.
* Karikázó: a circle dance performed by only women, and accompanied by singing of folksongs.
* Csárdás: New style dances developed in the 18th and 19th centuries, is the Hungarian name for the national dances, with Hungarian embroidered costumes and energetic music. From the men&#x27;s intricate bootslapping dances to the ancient women&#x27;s circle dances, Csárdás demonstrates the infectious exuberance of the Hungarian folk dancing still celebrated in the villages.
* Verbunkos: a solo man&#x27;s dance evolved from the recruiting performances of the Austro-Hungarian army.
* The Legényes: It is a men&#x27;s solo dance done by the ethnic Hungarian people living in the Kalotaszeg region of Transylvania. Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is performed freestyle usually by one dancer at a time in front of the band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side and sing/shout verses while the men dance. Each lad does a number of points (dance phrases) typically 4 to 8 without repetition. Each point consists of 4 parts, each lasting 4 counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).

==Embroidery==

It was in the beginning of the 18th century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both Renaissance and Baroque elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian Sassanide influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock&#x27;s feather.

Nearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe, also flourished among the Magyar peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.

The finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of Kalotaszeg in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color - red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow cases and sheets.

In Hungary proper, Sárköz (a historical area in Tolna) in Transdanubia and the Matyóföld in the Great Hungarian Plain produce the finest embroideries. In the Sárköz region, the women&#x27;s caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace and give evidence of the people&#x27;s wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women&#x27;s wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.

==Folk costumes (17th–19th centuries)==
==Ceramics==

===Black pottery===
These vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.

===Herend Porcelain===

Founded in 1826, Herend Porcelain is one of the world&#x27;s largest ceramic factories, specializing in luxury hand painted and gilded porcelain. In the mid-19th century, it was purveyor to the Habsburg Dynasty and aristocratic customers throughout Europe. Many of its classic patterns are still in production. After the fall of communism in Hungary, the factory was privatized and is now 75% owned by its management and workers, exporting to over 60 countries of the world.

==Hungarian domestic animals==

There are specifically Hungarian breeds of domestic animals which are seen as national symbols in Hungary:
* Long-horn Hungarian Grey Cattle - Hungarian breed, traditionally kept in the open full year. Nowadays, they are raised for infant food due to natural, healthy meat.
* Dogs 
** Hungarian Vizsla - one of the oldest hunting dogs in the world. The ancestors of this dog came into the Carpathian Basin with the nomadic Hungarian tribes.
** Puli - small shepherd dog
** Komondor - large shepherd dog, was brought to Hungary a thousand years ago by nomadic Magyars.
** Kuvasz - large shepherd dog
** Pumi - small shepherd dog
** &quot;Magyar Agár&quot; (Hungarian Greyhound) was already known in the 8th century. It is as old as the Vizsla.
** Transylvanian Bloodhound - Hungarian hound
** Mudi - shepherd dog
* Hungarian thoroughbred horses - a mid-19th century mixture of the best Arab and English racehorse characteristics.
* Mangalica, a breed of pig, with long curly hair and relatively fatty meat, which makes them ideal for making sausages and salami.

==Sport==
Only seven countries (USA, USSR, UK, France, Italy, China, and Germany) have won more Summer Olympic gold medals than Hungary. Hungary has the second most Olympic gold medals per capita in the Summer Olympics. Hungary has the ninth highest, out of 211 participating nations, all-time total medal count for the Olympic Games, with a total of 465 medals. This despite the fact that Hungary was punished and barred from participation in the 1920 and 1984 Olympics. In the Summer Olympics, Hungary was always been among the top 10 best nations (in gold medal count) between 1928 and 1996, when they were allowed to compete. Hungary had the third most gold medals in 1936, 1952, 1956, and 1960. &quot;See: All-time Olympic Games medal table&quot; (2008 data)

Among the most famous Hungarians is footballer Ferenc Puskás (1927–2006). He scored 84 goals in 85 internationals for Hungary, and 511 goals in 533 matches in the Hungarian and Spanish leagues. Puskás played in the 1954 FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany. In 1958, after the Hungarian Revolution, he emigrated to Spain, where he played on the legendary Real Madrid team that also included Alfredo Di Stéfano and Francisco Gento.

Hungarians are also known for their prowess at water sports, mainly swimming, water polo (See: Water polo at the Summer Olympics) (in which they defeated the Soviet team in 1956), and canoeing (they have won multiple medals). Krisztina Egerszegi is one of the greatest Hungarian Olympic champions of the modern era. She is a three-time Olympian (1988, 1992 and 1996) and five time Olympic champion in swimming; and one of three individuals to have ever won the same swimming event at three consecutive Summer Olympics. She is currently also the only female swimmer who won five individual Olympic gold medals. As a player, till date Dezső Gyarmati (1927–2013) is the first and only athlete (man or woman) to win five Olympic medals in water polo: three gold, one silver and one bronze. As a head coach, he guided the Hungary men&#x27;s national water polo team to three Olympic medals: one gold, one silver and one bronze, making him one of the most successful water polo coaches in Olympic history, and the only man to win Olympic gold in water polo as player and head coach in the last 100 years. In 2013, FINA described him as a &quot;legendary water polo player and coach&quot;, and &quot;one of the best players the game ever seen and in fact the most decorated in history&quot;.

Despite being landlocked, the presence of two major rivers (the Duna and the Tisza) and a major lake (Balaton), provide excellent opportunities to practice water sports. In recent years there has also been a steady rise in the number of golfers in the country; the sport has developed much over the past 20 years (after the fall of Socialism), but the economic situation hinders further development of golf courses.

Some of the world&#x27;s best sabre fencing athletes have historically hailed from Hungary.

Hungary&#x27;s national basketball team was one of Europe&#x27;s major basketball forces from the mid-1940s until the mid-1960s when it won several medals at the European Basketball Championship and often qualified for the Summer Olympics. In the past decades, the team showed its potential less frequently. Its most famous player in recent decades has been Kornél Dávid.

The Hungarian national ice hockey team also qualified for their first IIHF World Championship in more than 70 years.

== Games ==
Traditional toys are made from various plants, for example juglans (dió), nuts (mogyoró) or maize. &quot;Erre csörög a dió, arra meg a mogyoró&quot; is one of the most famous Magyar children&#x27;s games.

Ulti is one of the most famous card games played by a 32-card set so-called: &quot;Magyar kártya&quot;, exactly: &quot;Tell-Karte&quot; with German decks.

Button football is a tabletop game which is known in Europe, typically in Hungary.

The Rubik&#x27;s Cube was invented in Hungary in 1977 and gained international fame.

Hungary has produced many top-level chess players, notably Judith Polgar and Peter Leko. The 45th Chess Olympiad was hosted in Budapest in 2024.

== Flag ==

The flag of Hungary is a horizontal tricolour of red, white and green (red-white-green). This revised style was adopted on the 12th of October 1957 following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. 

The colours of were used during the coronation of Matthias II in 1608. It is speculated that the colours and their relationship with the Hungarian monarchy date back to the 13th century.

The colours of the flag are also present in the traditional Hungarian Coat of Arms. The red is thought to signify the various battles which Hungary has fought in, whilst the white and green denote Hungary&#x27;s rivers and mountains respectively.

<doc id="869110" wikidata="Q123702" url="?curid=869110" title="Ernesto Bertarelli">
<text>Ernesto Silvio Maurizio Bertarelli (born 22 September 1965) is an Italian-born Swiss billionaire businessman and philanthropist.

The 2017 edition of the Sunday Times Rich List estimated the family&#x27;s wealth at £11.5 billion, an increase of £1.72 billion since the previous year. Swiss magazine Bilanz estimated the family fortune at CHF13.5 billion. According to &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;, Bertarelli and family has an estimated net worth of $20.2 billion, as of 16 April 2021.

==Biography==
Born in Rome to Italian parents, his family moved to Switzerland in 1977. He graduated from Babson College in 1989, and earned an MBA at Harvard Business School in 1993.

===Career===
His grandfather, Pietro, joined Serono, a pharmaceutical company founded in 1906. In 1935 Pietro became the company&#x27;s managing director, a position he was succeeded in by his son, Fabio Bertarelli, in 1965. Bertarelli became CEO in 1996 and, along with his sister Dona, inherited ownership in 1998 on the death of his father. Changing the company&#x27;s focus from pharmaceuticals to biotechnology, revenues increased from $809 million in 1996 to $2.8 billion in 2006. The company gained fame from its discovery of a natural hormone used in the treatment of female infertility, and its treatments for multiple sclerosis and growth hormone deficiency.

Bertarelli and his family sold the company to Merck KGaA of Germany in January 2007 for US$13.3 billion, forming the new company Merck-Serono. His family split an estimated $9 billion stake at that time, which added to previous share sales when the company floated on the NY stock market in 2000, which is now invested mainly through his B-Flexion (formerly Waypoint Capital) investment vehicle. Bertarelli currently co-chairs – with his sister Dona – the Bertarelli Foundation which focuses on marine conservation and neuroscience research.

=== B-Flexion ===
Between 2002 and 2009, Bertarelli served as a board director of UBS AG.
Management of the family&#x27;s combined wealth is through B-Flexion, which invests through a number of separate specialist investment partnerships including such areas as real estate, technology, hedge funds and life sciences.

These businesses include Kedge Capital, an investment management group specialising in hedge funds and private equity; a UK real estate investment fund, Crosstree; and Gurnet Point Capital, a fund based in Boston that invests in healthcare and life science business.

As well as these businesses, B-Flexion, which is headquartered in Geneva, with offices in London, Jersey, Boston and Dublin, also manages investment holdings itself, including an allergy immunotherapy group Stallergenes-Greer, Corium, Corium Pharma Solutions, a contract development and manufacturing company, and a number of asset management businesses such as Longview and Capital Four.

=== Campus Biotech ===
On 22 May 2013, it was announced that a consortium led by the Bertarelli family and comprising Hansjörg Wyss, the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the University of Geneva had been successful in their bid for the former Merck Serono site in Geneva, which had been put up for sale when that company announced in April 2012 that it would be closing its Geneva headquarters. The name of the joint initiative is Campus Biotech and the site became a ‘centre of excellence in the fields of healthcare, biotechnology and life sciences’. As part of this, the EPFL and the University of Geneva occupy some 15,000m2 of the site and, in October 2013, it was announced that Campus Biotech was to be the core of a new Swiss neuroscience valley with the research groups involved in the Human Brain Project and the Blue Brain Project, as well as most scientists from the Center for Neuroprosthetics, moving there in 2014.

===Sailing===
His relationship with this sport is due to his youth spent in Monte Argentario. The name Alinghi derives from the Bertarelli family boats that sailed in the regatta fields around Porto Santo Stefano and Porto Ercole.

In 2000, Bertarelli founded the yachting syndicate Team Alinghi, which in 2003, representing the Société Nautique de Genève, won the Louis Vuitton Cup before beating Team New Zealand in Auckland to win the America&#x27;s Cup. It was the first time a team had ever won the coveted sailing trophy on its first attempt, with the victory bringing the Cup to Europe for the first time. Team Alinghi hired sailors from many different nationalities, including Russell Coutts and Brad Butterworth, respectively skipper and tactician of Team New Zealand&#x27;s 2000 crew. Bertarelli was Team Alinghi&#x27;s only Swiss national serving as navigator in 2003 and subsequently as an afterguard runner and grinder in 2007, when Team Alinghi defended the America&#x27;s Cup in Valencia. On July 3, 2007, Alinghi beat Team New Zealand in race 7 by 1 second to retain the America&#x27;s Cup, winning the series 5–2.

In recognition of his success, in 2003 Bertarelli was named Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur by French President Jacques Chirac, and was given the Cavaliere di Gran Croce by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, President of the Italian Republic.

Société Nautique de Genève and Bertarelli&#x27;s efforts to organize the 33rd America&#x27;s Cup following their 2007 victory in Alinghi were subject to numerous legal challenges by the Golden Gate Yacht Club. The race finally took place in February 2010, in Valencia, Spain. Bertarelli was the primary helmsman of his boat Alinghi 5, which lost both races against the challenger USA 17 by a considerable margin.

Alinghi now competes in the Extreme Sailing Series, which it most recently won in 2016, and in the summer-long, one-class D35 championship on Lake Geneva. Since 2016 he is a member of America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame.

===Philanthropy===
Bertarelli and his family established a foundation in 1999 for promoting research and development in the field of male and female infertility, assisted reproduction technologies, andrology, genetics and endocrinology; supporting training, education and international and national exchanges in these areas through grants. The Bertarelli Foundation, in Trelex, Switzerland, merged into the Foundation FABER, in Lausanne, in 2006, and since 2008 a renewed Bertarelli Foundation has regrouped the family&#x27;s numerous philanthropic initiatives in the fields of charity, health, sciences, sport and culture.

Some projects recently sponsored by the Bertarelli Foundation have been the research Centre for Neuroprosthetics at the EPFL in Lausanne; the partnership with the British government to create the largest marine reserve in the world in Chagos, in the Indian Ocean; a joint research and education program in neuroscience between Harvard Medical School and EPFL; the Swiss Sailing Grants in partnership with the Swiss Sailing Federation; and the Henna Pre-School in South Africa and a partnership with the Stoke-on-Trent YMCA that was led by Kirsty Bertarelli.

Bertarelli is a member of the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows. In 2023, Bertarelli pledged $75 million to Harvard Medical School to &quot;advance scientific discovery and a culture of entrepreneurship&quot;.

===Honorary doctorate===
Bertarelli was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Marine Sciences from Plymouth University in 2013.

===Personal life===
Bertarelli met Kirsty Roper, a former 1988 Miss UK and songwriter, while on holiday in Italy in 1997. The couple married in 2000, and have three children. The couple&#x27;s divorce was announced in October 2021. The couple lived in Gstaad and also spent time in their house on the shores of Lake Geneva.

In December 2008, Appledore Shipbuilders launched the hull of Project55, Bertarelli&#x27;s new yacht, which was completed as &quot;Vava II&quot; by Devonport Engineering Consortium Ltd at Plymouth in February 2012

<text>Schöneberg () is a locality of Berlin, Germany. Until Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform it was a separate borough including the locality of Friedenau. Together with the former borough of Tempelhof it is now part of the new borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg.

== History ==

The village was first documented in a 1264 deed issued by Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. In 1751, Bohemian weavers founded Neu-Schöneberg also known as Böhmisch-Schöneberg along northern Hauptstraße. During the Seven Years&#x27; War on 7 October 1760 Schöneberg and its village church were completely destroyed by a fire due to the joint attack on Berlin by Habsburg and Russian troops.

Both Alt-Schöneberg and Neu-Schöneberg were in an area developed in the course of industrialisation and incorporated in a street network laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. The two villages were not combined as one entity until 1874 and received town privileges in 1898. In the following year it was disentangled from the &quot;Kreis&quot; of Teltow, and became a Prussian Stadtkreis (independent city). Many of the former peasants gained wealth by selling their acres to the settlement companies of growing Berlin and built luxurious mansions on Hauptstraße. The large town hall, Rathaus Schöneberg, was completed in 1914. In 1920, Schöneberg became a part of Greater Berlin. Subsequent to World War II the Rathaus served as the city hall of West Berlin until 1991 when the administration of the reunited City of Berlin moved back to the Rotes Rathaus in Mitte.

=== Gay life ===
The area around Nollendorfplatz has been the heart of gay life in Berlin, since the 1920s and early–1930s during the Weimar Republic. 

The Eldorado nightclub on Motzstraße was closed down by the Nazis on coming to power in December 1932. Holocaust survivor Elsa Conrad co-ran the lesbian bar &quot;Mali und Igel.&quot; Inside the bar, was a club called &quot;Monbijou des Westens.&quot; The club was exclusive and catered for Berlin&#x27;s lesbian, intellectual elite; one famous guest was the actress Marlene Dietrich. Each year the club hosted balls with up to 600 women in attendance.

The painter and printmaker Otto Dix used patrons of this establishment as subjects for some of his works. Christopher Isherwood lived just around the corner on Nollendorfstraße. This apartment was the basis for his book &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; (1939) and later the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966), and the film version of &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972) is commemorated by a historic plaque on the building.

== Quarters ==
The locality of Schöneberg includes the &quot;Stadtquartiere&quot;s of Bayerisches Viertel (English: “”; an affluent residential area with streets named after Bavarian towns) and the Rote Insel (English: “red island”) as well as Lindenhof and the large natural park area Südgelände (English: “south grounds”) on the outside of the Ringbahn railway circle line.

== Popular sights ==
* Dorfkirche, the old village church, built in 1766
* Rathaus Schöneberg on John-F.-Kennedy-Platz (formerly Rudolph-Wilde-Platz, built in 1914), where, on 26 June 1963, U.S. President John F. Kennedy held his &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech in front of hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic spectators.
* Headquarters of the RIAS Berlin (Radio in the American Sector) from 1948 to 1993, then headquarters of DeutschlandRadio Berlin from 1994 until the station was renamed Deutschlandradio Kultur in 2005. The building was erected in 1941 by the IG Farben conglomerate.
* Former headquarters of the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), the public transport company of Berlin, on Potsdamer Straße
* Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe), the largest department store in continental Europe, at Wittenbergplatz
* Heinrich-von-Kleist-Park, first laid out in 1656 by Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg as a nursery, later Berlin&#x27;s Botanical Garden, which in 1910 moved to Dahlem. The Kammergericht appellate court building was erected within the park in 1913, together with two colonnades by Carl von Gontard from 1780, which had been moved here from the Alexanderplatz. On 8 August 1944 it was the site of the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; show trial of members of the 20 July plot led by judge-president Roland Freisler. From 1945 onward, the building served as the seat of the Allied Control Council in Berlin. When the Soviet representatives left the Council in 1948, the Berlin Air Safety Centre remained there as the only four-power authority (besides Spandau Prison), while the rest of the building was empty. Today it again serves as the seat of the Kammergericht.
* Pallasstraße Hochbunker, a former air-raid shelter, built in 1943 by forced laborers. A large social housing estate was built in 1977 to partially bridge over the bunker and to cross the street, the former site of the Berlin Sportpalast. This is where Joseph Goebbels held his 1943 &quot;Total War&quot; speech. It was demolished in 1973. The present housing estate is known to Berliners as the Sozialpalast (&quot;Social Palace&quot;).
* Lutherkirche at Denewitzplatz, which now houses the American Church in Berlin.

<text>DeDe Lind (born Diane Gayle Lind) was an American glamour model famous for her appearance in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine as the Playmate of the Month for August 1967.

==Biography==

===Playboy===
Lind&#x27;s photographer friend, Leon, talked her into testing for &quot;Playboy&quot;. At 19, she was selected to be the &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate for August 1967. The photography was done by Mario Casilli. Lind received more fan mail than any other &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate in history.

Lind&#x27;s color likeness traveled to space. The November 1969 Playboy calendar photo of Lind was on Apollo XII. The ground crew for the mission stashed the photo, which they labeled &quot;MAP OF A HEAVENLY BODY&quot; inside a locker aboard the command module &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot;. Astronaut Richard Gordon, the commander of the Yankee Clipper, put the photo up for auction in 2011 for a minimum bid of US$1000 (). The winning bid was for US$21,013.20 ().

===Later career===
Lind appeared in the December 1979 issue of &quot;Playmates Forever&quot; and, in the early 1980s, in the first &quot;Playmate Playoffs&quot; special issue. Her video appearances for &quot;Playboy&quot; included &quot;Race Horses&quot; and a frontal-nudity appearance on a sailing yacht. She was also the subject for &quot;Playmates Revisited&quot; in the March 1996 issue.

As of 1999, Lind resided in Boca Raton, Florida.

===Death===
DeDe died February 4, 2020, from ovarian cancer in Boca Raton, Florida, at the age of 72.

<doc id="869123" wikidata="Q156103" url="?curid=869123" title="Gastroenteritis">
<text>Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach and intestine. Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Fever, lack of energy, and dehydration may also occur. This typically lasts less than two weeks. Although it is not related to influenza, in the U.S it is sometimes called the &quot;stomach flu&quot;.

Gastroenteritis is usually caused by viruses; however, gut bacteria, parasites, and fungi can also cause gastroenteritis. In children, rotavirus is the most common cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; are common causes. Eating improperly prepared food, drinking contaminated water or close contact with a person who is infected can spread the disease. Treatment is generally the same with or without a definitive diagnosis, so testing to confirm is usually not needed.

For young children in impoverished countries, prevention includes hand washing with soap, drinking clean water, breastfeeding babies instead of using formula, and proper disposal of human waste. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended as a prevention for children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts and sugar). In those who are breastfed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed. However, antibiotics are recommended for young children with a fever and bloody diarrhea.

In 2015, there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis, resulting in 1.3 million deaths globally. Children and those in the developing world are affected the most. In 2011, there were about 1.7 billion cases, resulting in about 700,000 deaths of children under the age of five. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of immunity.

==Signs and symptoms==

Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting. Sometimes, only one or the other is present. This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.

Children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days. However, in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common. Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea. Severe dehydration in children may be recognized if the skin color and position returns slowly when pressed. This is called &quot;prolonged capillary refill&quot; and &quot;poor skin turgor&quot;. Abnormal breathing is another sign of severe dehydration. Repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation, and malnutrition. Stunted growth and long-term cognitive delays can result.

Reactive arthritis occurs in 1% of people following infections with &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species. Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; or &quot;Shigella&quot; species. HUS causes low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low red blood cell count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.

==Cause==
Viruses (particularly rotavirus (in children) and norovirus (in adults)) and the bacteria &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species are the primary causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome including parasites and fungi. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but they are less likely than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity. Children are also at higher risk because they are less likely to practice good hygiene habits. Children living in areas without easy access to water and soap are especially vulnerable.

===Viral===
Rotaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses are known to cause viral gastroenteritis. Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity. Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases. Generally speaking, viral gastroenteritis accounts for 21–40% of the cases of infectious diarrhea in developed countries.

Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in America accounting for about 90% of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time proximate to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.

===Bacterial===

In some countries, &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; is the primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Shigella&quot;, and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.

Toxigenic &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; is an important cause of diarrhea that occurs more often in the elderly. Infants can carry these bacteria without developing symptoms. It is a common cause of diarrhea in those who are hospitalized and is frequently associated with antibiotic use. &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; infectious diarrhea may also occur in those who have used antibiotics. Acute &quot;traveler&#x27;s diarrhea&quot; is usually a type of bacterial gastroenteritis, while the persistent form is usually parasitic. Acid-suppressing medication appears to increase the risk of significant infection after exposure to several organisms, including &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species. The risk is greater in those taking proton pump inhibitors than with H2 antagonists.

===Parasitic===
A number of parasites can cause gastroenteritis. &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; is most common, but &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; spp., and other species have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. &quot;Giardia&quot; occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this type of illness can occur nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men who have sex with men, and following disasters.

===Transmission===
Transmission may occur from drinking contaminated water or when people share personal objects. Water quality typically worsens during the rainy season and outbreaks are more common at this time. In areas with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. Worldwide, bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, (especially among children), in crowded households, and in those with poor nutritional status. Adults who have developed immunities might still carry certain organisms without exhibiting symptoms. Thus, adults can become natural reservoirs of certain diseases. While some agents (such as &quot;Shigella&quot;) only occur in primates, others (such as &quot;Giardia&quot;) may occur in a wide variety of animals.

===Non-infectious===
There are a number of non-infectious causes of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn&#x27;s disease is also a non-infectious cause of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.

In the United States, rates of emergency department use for noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped 30% from 2006 until 2011. Of the twenty most common conditions seen in the emergency department, rates of noninfectious gastroenteritis had the largest decrease in visits in that time period.

==Pathophysiology==

Gastroenteritis is defined as vomiting or diarrhea due to inflammation of the small or large bowel, often due to infection. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;) to as many as 108 (for &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;).

==Diagnosis==
Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person&#x27;s signs and symptoms. Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.

However, stool cultures should be performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might have been exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children younger than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.

===Dehydration===
A determination of whether or not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple&#x27;s disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits &quot;only&quot; vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).

Appendicitis may present with vomiting, abdominal pain, and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.

==Prevention==
===Water, sanitation, hygiene===

A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.
Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.

===Vaccination===
Due to both its effectiveness and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally. Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development. In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in the rates and severity of disease. This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections. Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent. The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age. The oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50–60% effective over two years.

There are a number of vaccines against gastroenteritis in development. For example, vaccines against &quot;Shigella&quot; and enterotoxigenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (ETEC), which are two of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide.

==Management==
Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.

===Rehydration===
The primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required if there is a decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under five years of age as they may &quot;increase&quot; diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours&#x27; worth is often sufficient.

===Dietary===
It is recommended that breast-fed infants continue to be nursed in the usual fashion, and that formula-fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ORT. Lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas usually are not necessary. Children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with the exception that foods high in simple sugars should be avoided. The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and tea) is no longer recommended, as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding.

A Cochrane Review from 2020 concludes that probiotics make little or no difference to people who have diarrhea lasting 2 days or longer and that there is no proof that they reduce its duration. They may be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial. Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.

===Antiemetics===
Antiemetic medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis, although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates of resistance to the latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include &quot;Shigella&quot; &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot;, and &quot;Giardia&quot; species. In those with &quot;Giardia&quot; species or &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.

===Antimotility agents===
Antimotility medication has a theoretical risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown this to be unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, can be used in mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3 million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those younger than five, there were about 1.7 billion cases resulting in 0.7 million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world&#x27;s poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under five years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.

In 1980, gastroenteritis from all causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, with the majority occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by 2000, largely due to the introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy. In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375 million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.

==Society and culture==
Gastroenteritis is associated with many colloquial names, including &quot;Montezuma&#x27;s revenge&quot;, &quot;Delhi belly&quot;, &quot;la turista&quot;, and &quot;back door sprint&quot;, among others. It has played a role in many military campaigns and is believed to be the origin of the term &quot;no guts no glory&quot;.

Gastroenteritis is the main reason for 3.7 million visits to physicians a year in the United States and 3 million visits in France. In the United States gastroenteritis as a whole is believed to result in costs of US$23 billion per year, with rotavirus alone resulting in estimated costs of US$1 billion a year.

== Terminology ==

The first usage of &quot;gastroenteritis&quot; was in 1825. Before this time it was commonly known as typhoid fever or &quot;cholera morbus&quot;, among others, or less specifically as &quot;griping of the guts&quot;, &quot;surfeit&quot;, &quot;flux&quot;, &quot;colic&quot;, &quot;bowel complaint&quot;, or any one of several other archaic names for acute diarrhea. Cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera.

==Animals==
Many of the same agents cause gastroenteritis in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot;. A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms.

Some agents are more specific to a certain species. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. It is believed to be introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available. It is not transmissible to humans.

<text>John Rick MacArthur (born June 4, 1956) is an American journalist, historian, and author of books about US politics. He is the president and publisher of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==Biography==
MacArthur is the son of J. Roderick MacArthur and French-born Christiane L’Étendart.
and the grandson of billionaire John D. MacArthur. He grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, graduating from North Shore Country Day School in 1974. He graduated from Columbia University with a B.A. in history in 1978. In 2017 he was named a chevalier in the French order of arts and letters. He lives with his wife and two daughters in New York City. He is well known for his skeptical stance of the internet, all things technological and insistence on print publishing.

==Career==
MacArthur writes a monthly column, in French, for &quot;Le Devoir&quot; on a wide range of topics from politics to culture and is
a regular contributor to the &quot;Spectator&quot; (U.K.), the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot;.

Though John D. MacArthur disinherited his son J. Roderick MacArthur, the latter served on the board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation until his death in 1984. In 1980, John R. MacArthur persuaded the foundation to partner in creating and funding a Harper&#x27;s Magazine Foundation to acquire and operate the magazine of the same name. This new entity acquired &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (which was then losing nearly $2 million per year and was on the verge of ceasing publication) for $250,000. He became president and publisher of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1983.

In 1993 he received the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;&#x27;s H.L. Mencken Writing Award for best editorial/op-ed column for his &quot;New York Times&quot; exposé of &quot;Nayirah&quot;, the Kuwaiti diplomat&#x27;s daughter who helped fake the Iraqi baby-incubator atrocity.

MacArthur has been a reporter for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; (1977), the &quot;Washington Star&quot; (1978), &quot;The Bergen Record&quot; (1978–1979), &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; (1979–1982), and an assistant foreign editor at United Press International (1982).

MacArthur serves on the board of The Author&#x27;s Guild and the Death Penalty Information Center. He received the Philolexian Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement in 2009.

<text>Deal Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII in Deal, Kent, between 1539 and 1540. It formed part of the King&#x27;s Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the strategically important Downs anchorage off the English coast. Comprising a keep with six inner and outer bastions, the moated stone castle covered and had sixty-six firing positions for artillery. It cost the Crown a total of £27,092 to build the three castles of Deal, Sandown and Walmer, which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences. The original invasion threat passed but, during the Second English Civil War of 1648–49, Deal was seized by pro-Royalist insurgents and was only retaken by Parliamentary forces after several months&#x27; fighting.

Although it remained armed, Deal was adapted by Sir John Norris and Lord Carrington during the 18th and 19th centuries to form a more suitable private house for the castle&#x27;s captain, which was by now an honorary position. In 1904, the War Office concluded that the castle no longer had any value either as a defensive site or as a barracks and it was opened to the public when the captain was not in residence. Early in the Second World War, the captain&#x27;s quarters were destroyed by German bombing, forcing Deal&#x27;s then-captain, William Birdwood, to move to Hampton Court Palace and the castle became an observation post for an artillery battery placed along the shore line. The castle was not brought back into use as a residence and was restored by the government during the 1950s to form a tourist attraction. In the 21st century, Deal Castle is operated by English Heritage, receiving 25,256 visitors in 2008.

==History==

===16th century===

====Background====

Deal Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a limited role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III so as to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.

====Construction====
Deal and the adjacent castles of Walmer and Sandown were constructed to protect the Downs in east Kent, an important anchorage formed by the Goodwin Sands which gave access to Deal Beach, on which enemy soldiers could easily be landed and an area the King knew well. The stone castles were supported by a line of four earthwork forts, known as the Great Turf, the Little Turf Bulwark, the Great White Bulwark of Clay and the Walmer Bulwark, and a defensive ditch and bank. Collectively the castles became known as the &quot;castles of the Downes&quot;.
It is not known who designed Deal Castle, but Sir Edward Ryngeley and Thomas Wingfield served as the commissioners for the project, with Robert Loyrde and David Marten as the paymaster and comptroller, and Christopher Dickenson and William Clement as the master mason and carpenters. Work began at Deal in April and progressed at speed, with 1,400 men at work on the site by the following month. A strike for higher pay was broken up over the summer by Ryngeley and by December, when Anne of Cleves dined there, the castle was mostly completed. Deal and the other fortifications along the Downs cost the Crown a total of £27,092 to build, much of which came from proceeds of the dissolution of the monasteries a few years before. Lead, timber and stone from local monasteries were also recycled for use in Deal Castle.

Wingfield became the first captain of the castle in 1540, supported by a lieutenant and overseeing a garrison of eight soldiers, sixteen gunners and two porters. He reported to the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

The original invasion threat passed, but the castle was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack. Around 1570, the main bastions were filled with earth, probably to allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 in response to the threat posed by the Spanish armada and were probably kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign.

===17th century===
During the first decade of the 1600s, England was at peace with France and Spain and coastal defences received little attention. By 1615, Deal Castle was in a poor state, its outer walls damaged by storms and coastal erosion, while a survey suggested repairs estimated at £396 were necessary. The Captain of the castle, William Byng, wrote numerous letters to his superiors, claiming winter storms had filled the moat with water and stones from the beach and undermined the castle foundations. By 1618, he reported most of the garrison were living in the nearby town, with only a small guard force manning the castle at night.

As its condition deteriorated, fighting between Dutch, French and Spanish ships in the Downs became common, increasing the strategic importance of fortifications along the Kent coast. A new survey in 1624 estimated the cost of repairs had escalated to £1,243 and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, suggested nearby Camber Castle be demolished to provide materiel for the work. This does not appear to have been acted on, although some repairs were probably completed in the late 1630s. The castle was seized by Parliamentarian forces at the start of the First English Civil War in August 1642, with William Batten replacing William Byng, who was suspected of Royalist sympathies, although the castle played little part in this conflict.

When the Second English Civil War broke out in 1648, the Parliamentarian navy was based in the Downs, protected by Walmer and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across Kent. The previous year, Batten had been forced to resign as Commander of the Fleet and he now encouraged elements of the navy to switch sides. Sir Henry Palmer, a former sailor, accompanied by other members of the Kentish gentry, also called on the fleet to revolt, taking advantage of the many fellow Kentish men in the crews. Walmer and Deal Castle declared for the King, shortly after the garrisons at Sandown. Rainsborough was removed from his post as captain. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast or aid sent to the Scots.

Parliament defeated the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with Deal and the other castles along the Downs. Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged and surrendered on 12 July. Deal, which had been resupplied by the Royalists from the sea, was besieged in July. A Royalist fleet bombarded the Parliamentarian positions and temporarily landed a force of 1,500 Flemish mercenaries in support of the revolt, but a shortage of money forced their return to the Continent. The garrison then carried out a surprise attack on their besiegers but were fought back with some losses. The fleet, under the command of Prince Charles, attempted to land a fresh force in August, but despite three attempts the operation failed and suffered heavy losses. After news arrived of the Royalist defeat at Preston, Deal surrendered on 20 August and artillery assaults then began on Sandown, leading the remaining garrisons to surrender.

Rich became the new Captain and reported the castle had been badly damaged during the conflict, being &quot;much torn and spoiled with the granades&quot;, and he estimated repairs work would cost at least £500. A governor, Samuel Taverner, was appointed, supported by a corporal and twenty soldiers. In light of the Dutch threat, Deal Castle was maintained and kept equipped with powder, and was reinforced with earthworks and soldiers at the start of the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652. Following the Stuart Restoration in 1660, the garrison was reduced in size and their pay reduced, but the castle continued to play an important role in defending the Downs during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars, supported by local trained bands. Byng attempted to reclaim his former captainship under the new regime, and may have been briefly reappointed in early 1660. Following the December 1688 Glorious Revolution which removed James II, the townsfolk of Deal seized the castle in support of William of Orange, and took steps to defend the Downs against a feared Irish invasion which never materialised.

===18th–21st centuries===

Deal Castle continued to be used as a military fortification throughout the 18th century and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar work had been carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville and there may have been some competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter&#x27;s lodge was also updated.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the castle was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, supported by further artillery batteries placed along the beach. To protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles, were formed in 1794 by William Pitt the Younger—then both the prime minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports—and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. The politician and banker Lord Carrington carried out improvements to the castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt&#x27;s work at Walmer. According to Samuel Wilberforce, Carrington had hoped to charge the cost of the work to the Treasury, but when he attempted to submit the claims, they were rejected by Pitt and he had to pay for the improvements himself.

Deal Castle was increasingly resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and this led to arguments in 1829 as to whether it should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.

During the Second World War, in November 1940, during the Blitz, German bombers destroyed much of the captain&#x27;s quarters, forcing the incumbent, William Birdwood, to move to Hampton Court Palace. Two 6-inch naval guns were mounted in front of the castle between 1940 and 1944, manned by 337 Battery of 563 Coast Regiment. The castle operated as a Battery Operating Post—one of the first-floor rooms in the keep became the Battery Office—and provided accommodation. Following Birdwood&#x27;s death, in 1951, the castle officially ceased to function as a residence and was passed to the Ministry of Public Building and Works. Restoration work was carried out during the 1950s, largely removing the remaining 18th-century modifications on the seaward side of the castle. In 1972 the captaincy of Deal Castle (in abeyance since 1951) was revived, as an honorary appointment, and vested in General Sir Norman Tailyour; he was succeeded in 1979 by Major General Ian Harrison. Since the latter&#x27;s death, in 2008, the captaincy has been held &quot;ex officio&quot; by the Commandant General Royal Marines.

In the 21st century, Deal Castle is operated by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 25,256 visitors in 2008. It is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.

==Architecture==
Deal Castle retains most of its original 16th-century structure, including a tall keep with six semi-circular bastions, across, at the centre, flanked by a further six rounded bastions, the western of which served as a gatehouse, surrounded by a moat and a curtain wall. The castle&#x27;s bastion walls are thick. It was constructed using Kentish ragstone from near Maidstone, locally made bricks and Caen stone recycled from local monasteries. It was larger than its sister castles at Walmer and Sandown, measuring approximately across and covering .

The castle originally had four tiers of artillery – the heaviest and longest-range weapons occupying the upper levels, including the keep – with a total of 66 firing positions and another 53 gunloops in the basement for handguns, should close defence be required. The embrasures in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the guns to operate and traverse, and the interior of the castle was designed with vents to allow the smoke from its guns to escape. The battlements on the modern castle are in a faux medieval, rather than Tudor, style and date from 1732.

The historian John Hale considered the original castle to form a transitional design between older medieval English designs and the newer Italian styles of defence. Like its sister castles along the Downs, Deal suffered from design problems: it needed too many guns to ever be fully equipped; its curved surfaces were vulnerable to attack; and despite attempts to keep the walls low and thick, its relatively high profile, driven by the requirement to support several tiers of defences, exposed it to attack.

Deal Castle is entered through the gatehouse, which originally overlooked a walled garden, since largely destroyed. The dry, stone-lined moat, wide and deep, would originally have been crossed over a stone causeway and a drawbridge, the latter now replaced by a modern wooden bridge. The gatehouse still has its original iron-studded doors – the historian Jonathan Coad considers them &quot;among the best preserved for their date&quot; – and five murder-holes to enable the garrison to defend the internal passageway with missiles or handguns; it would originally have also been protected by a portcullis at the entrance. The outer bastions were filled with earth in the 1570s, and have 18th-century ramparts; the superstructure around the eastern bastion was rebuilt after the Second World War. A passageway called &quot;the Rounds&quot; runs along the outside of the outer bastions, linking the handgun positions covering the base of the moat.

The keep has a central newel staircase, linking the basement, ground and first floors. When first built, the garrison would have lived on the ground floor of the keep, the first floor being used by the captain, and the basement for stores. The ground floor is subdivided by radial walls and originally would have been further subdivided by partitions; the original ovens and fireplace survive. The first floor mainly dates from the 1720s, although some Tudor elements remain. There is a wooden lantern structure on the top of the keep that contains a bell dating from 1655 and early 18th-century graffiti. The keep&#x27;s gun embrasures were converted to form sash windows in the 18th and 19th centuries.

<doc id="869140" wikidata="Q1552433" url="?curid=869140" title="Preverb">
<text>Although not used in general linguistic theory, the term preverb is used in Caucasian (including all three families: Northwest Caucasian, Northeast Caucasian and Kartvelian), Caddoan, Athabaskan, and Algonquian linguistics to describe certain elements prefixed to verbs. In the context of Indo-European languages, the term is usually used for separable verb prefixes.

Theoretically, any prefix could be called a preverbal element. However, in practice, the term &quot;preverb&quot; applies more narrowly in those families and refers to a prefixed element that is normally outside the premise of verbal morphology like locations of noun elements or, less often, noun elements themselves.

==Algonquian==
In Algonquian languages, preverbs can be described as phonologically separate words that may precede a verb and share its inflection. In particular, pronominal prefixes or initial change are applied to the first preverb, if any, of the verb complex rather than to the verb stem. Their meaning can range from past tense or perfective aspect to meanings for which English might use an adverb or another verb, like these from Ojibwe:
In Munsee, some words can come between a preverb and its verb.

See also prenoun in such languages.

==Caddoan==
In Caddoan linguistics, preverbal elements are less well defined as a class, and often, &quot;preverb&quot; designates a part of the verbal root that can be separated from the rest of the root by certain prefixes, as in this Wichita example:

==Northwest Caucasian languages==
In Northwest Caucasian languages, they can have nouns, directional and locative preverbs (like prepositions), like in this example from Ubykh:

==Mandarin Chinese==
For Mandarin Chinese and many other varieties of Chinese, the term refers to some words that carry the meanings of prepositions in English. In Chinese, they are lexically verbs and appear before the noun in question. They are more commonly referred to as coverbs.

==Georgian==
In Georgian, a Kartvelian language, the main function of a preverb is to distinguish the present tenses and the future tenses. To turn a present tense verb into a future tense, a preverb is added to the verb compound. In addition, preverbs also have directional meanings in Georgian.

Preverbs are directly attached to the beginning of the verb compound:

: and 
: and 

Note in those two examples that the meaning of the future tense is achieved only by adding the preverb; no other grammatical change occurs. In these examples, preverbs have directional meanings:
: 
: 

Again, note that only the preverbs are changed to convey the meaning of various directional meanings.

Preverbs add directional meanings not only to the verbs of motion but also to any other kind of verbs. Compare the examples of the verb :
: 
: 

As can be seen from the examples, the preverb changes according to the indirect object (the person for (to) whom the verb is being done).

Many verbs have a common root. For example, &quot;end&quot; and &quot;stay&quot; have the same verb root, . The meanings of the verbs are distinguished by their preverbs and other elements of the verb compound:
: , 

As is clear, the verbs are identical in the present tense but differ in the future tense by their preverbs.

==Modern Persian==
A preverb is a morpheme, which is applied together with the participles modifying their meaning and the meaning of their derivates.

Some Persian preverbs, referred to as &quot;pīš fi&#x27;l&quot; or &quot;pīšvand e fi&#x27;l&quot;, are:

*bar (meaning up, upon, from Middle Persian abar) 
*bar (meaning fruit, from Middle Persian bar)
*bar (bar meaning chest, side, direction, from Middle Persian war) and var (alternative form of bar)
*bāz 
*far and fara
*farāz
*foru and forud
*ham and an 
*ni 
*go (e.g godāxtan, gozāštan, gorīxtan, etc...)
*negah and negāh
*pas
*piš
*ru
*sar
*vā
*andar and dar
*pay 
*ā 
*tar and tara
*par and para

Pre-verbs can modify the procedure attribute of the verbs and the infinitives, but they do not change their objective attribute:


The Pre-verb is normally positioned ahead of the verb. If the verb is composed of two separable components, the pre-verb is positioned ahead of the second component. The Pre-verb can be positioned at the end of the sentence, owing to versification requirements:

از کارِ خير عزمِ تو هرگز نگشت باز

هرگز زِ راه بازنگشته‌ست هيچ تير

Manuchehri (11th - 12th Century AD)

== Pingelapese ==
Pingelapese is a language spoken on the Island of Pingelap atoll, located in Micronesia. This language uses preverbs in existential sentences, one of their four sentence structures. The verb is used when a character of a story or statement is already known.

== Toki Pona ==
In the constructed language Toki Pona, a preverb is a class of words that can be placed at the start of the predicate in front of the verb. Toki Pona preverbs have various functions, such as marking grammatical mood or aspect.

Some examples:

<text>A memorial in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church is a lower-ranked feast day in honour of a saint, the dedication of a church, or a mystery of the religion.

All feast days are ranked according to their importance and named as &quot;solemnities&quot;, or &quot;feasts&quot;, or &quot;memorials&quot;.

Memorials are always supplanted by a coinciding solemnity, feast, Sunday, Ash Wednesday, Holy Week, or day of the Octave of Easter.

==Present rules==
===Observance===
Celebrations of solemnities and feasts are distinguished from those of memorials by, for instance, recitation of the &quot;Gloria in excelsis&quot; in the Mass (an inclusion otherwise allowed only on Sundays) and the &quot;Te Deum&quot; in the Liturgy of the Hours.

The observance of memorials is integrated into the celebration of the occurring weekday (the &quot;feria&quot;) according to the norms set forth in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM) and the Liturgy of the Hours.

The GIRM lays down that, for memorials of saints, &quot;unless proper readings are given, the readings assigned for the weekday are normally used. In certain cases, particularised readings are provided, that is to say, readings which highlight some particular aspect of the spiritual life or activity of the Saint. The use of such readings is not to be insisted upon, unless a pastoral reason truly suggests it&quot;. The Collect proper to the memorial is used or, if this is lacking, one from an appropriate Common. As to the Prayer over the Offerings and the Prayer after Communion, unless these are proper, they may be taken either from the Common or from the weekday of the current time of the year.

Celebrations of memorials occurring between 17 and 24 December and during Lent, which are then never obligatory, consist of replacing the collect of the day with that of the saint.

The General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours gives the following indications on celebration of memorials occurring on ordinary days:
In the Office of Readings and at Lauds and Vespers:
:a) All the psalms with their antiphons are taken from the current weekday, unless the memorial has proper antiphons and psalms.
:b) If the memorial has its own antiphon for the invitatory, hymn, short reading, Benedictus and Magnificat antiphons and intercessions, these are used. Otherwise these elements are taken either from the Common or from the Office of the current week and day.
:c) The concluding prayer is taken from the Office of the saint.
:d) In the Office of Readings, the biblical reading with its responsory is that assigned to the weekday. The hagiographical second reading with its responsory is proper to the saint, but if no proper reading is assigned, the reading is either taken from the Common or is the patristic reading of the weekday
:e) Prayer during the Day and Compline are taken entirely from the weekday.

Celebrations of memorials occurring between 17 and 24 December and during Lent, which are then never obligatory, consist of adding to the Office of Readings, after the patristic reading and responsory of the weekday, the hagiographical reading and responsory of the saint, and concluding with the prayer of the saint; and adding to Lauds and Vespers, after the concluding prayer of the weekday, the antiphon (proper or common) and the prayer of the saint.

===Obligatory and optional memorials===
Memorials are either obligatory or optional. The rules governing the celebration of memorials, whether obligatory or optional, are identical. The only difference is precisely that an optional memorial need not be observed, and, with the limitations indicated for the second part of Advent and for Lent, there is the possibility of celebrating instead the Mass either of another memorial assigned to that day, or of the weekday, or of any saint mentioned in the Roman Martyrology for that day, or indeed (except during the first part of Advent, the days from 2 January to the day before Epiphany, and Eastertide), a Mass for Various Needs, or a Votive Mass.

Sometimes memorials that are called obligatory cease to be such. This occurs to those that fall within Lent. If two obligatory memorials coincide (as can happen when the movable memorial of the Immaculate Heart of Mary falls on the date of a fixed obligatory memorial), both become optional.

==Pre-Vatican II forms of the Roman Rite==
In approximate correspondence to memorials, Pope John XXIII&#x27;s 1960 Code of Rubrics spoke of &quot;third-class feasts&quot;, as can be seen in the General Roman Calendar of 1960, and gave some of them, either permanently or on the occasions when their celebration coincided with one of higher rank, only a commemoration within the office actually celebrated. The Code of Rubrics laid down that, unless proper psalms are assigned, a third-class office uses the weekday psalms and at matins combines the second and third readings for the ferial day into a second reading, with a reading about the saint or mystery providing the third, followed by the Te Deum. In lauds and vespers, everything after the psalms is either from the proper or the common of the feast. The same is done at terce, sext, and none. There are very few changes at prime. Compline is of the weekday unless otherwise assigned. Third-class feasts are merely commemorated on weekdays of Lent and are not observed on Sundays. During Advent, they add a commemoration of the ferial day, except on 17–23 December, days classified as second-class ferias that thus outrank them.
Before the 1960 Code of Rubrics, saints and mysteries were traditionally ranked as doubles, semidoubles and simples, with doubles further subdivided into first-class doubles, second-class doubles, major doubles and mere doubles. A few years before Pope John XXIII&#x27;s reform, Pope Pius XII had already abolished semidoubles and Pope Pius X had done away with the tradition that any double feast, of which there were over 200 in the course of the year, outranked a normal Sunday celebration.

<doc id="869155" wikidata="Q1248825" url="?curid=869155" title="Quatermass II">
<text>Quatermass II is a British science fiction serial, originally broadcast by BBC Television in the autumn of 1955. It is the second in the &quot;Quatermass&quot; series by writer Nigel Kneale, and the oldest of those serials to survive in its entirety in the BBC archives.

The serial sees Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group being asked to examine strange meteorite showers. His investigations lead to his uncovering a conspiracy involving alien infiltration at the highest levels of the British government. As even some of Quatermass&#x27;s closest colleagues fall victim to the alien influence, he is forced to use his own unsafe rocket prototype, which recently caused a nuclear disaster at an Australian testing range, to prevent the aliens from taking over mankind.

Although sometimes compared unfavourably to the first and third &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, &quot;Quatermass II&quot; was praised for its allegorical concerns of the damaging effects of industrialisation and the corruption of governments by big business. It is described on the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline website as &quot;compulsive viewing&quot;.

== Casting and crew ==
Reginald Tate, who had played the title role in &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, collapsed and died on 23 August 1955, aged 58. This was less than a month before the shooting of the location filming for &quot;Quatermass II&quot; began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; John Robinson was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson&#x27;s delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.

Appearing as Quatermass&#x27;s chief assistant Dr Leo Pugh was Welsh actor Hugh Griffith, who had been an actor on stage and screen since the 1930s, but gained his highest profile roles after &quot;Quatermass II&quot;; he went on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as Sheikh Ilderim in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959). He also appeared in &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; (1957) and &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968).

Monica Grey played Paula Quatermass; she was chosen by BBC management rather than the production team, as she was the wife of the BBC&#x27;s head of radio drama, Val Gielgud. As Hugh Griffith also had problems with some of his technical dialogue, Grey learned his lines as well as her own, in case she needed to step in and assist him during the live performance. Dillon was played by John Stone; Stone too had a long career as a supporting actor in a range of British television series, and in 1956 had a small role in the film &quot;X the Unknown&quot;, which Hammer Film Productions had intended as a sequel to their version of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, until Kneale denied them the rights to use the character.

Four actors who each became well known for a particular role on British television had supporting parts in &quot;Quatermass II&quot;. Rupert Davies who played MP Vincent Broadhead would go on to find fame as Sûreté detective Commissaire Jules Maigret, the title character of 1960s TV series &quot;Maigret&quot;, based on Georges Simenon&#x27;s novels. Roger Delgado, who found fame in the 1970s as the Master in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1971–73), played a journalist who helps Quatermass before falling victim to &quot;the mark&quot; in episode four. Wilfrid Brambell, later star of the sitcom &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1962–74), appeared as a tramp. and Melvyn Hayes, who played the small role of Frankie, later worked in several films with Cliff Richard and starred in the BBC sitcom &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;.

Nigel Kneale not only wrote the serial but, previously an actor, had two speaking parts. He played the voice heard over the factory loudspeaker system in episode five, and narrated the recaps at the beginning of episodes two, three, four and six. Kneale went on to write feature film screenplays such as &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1958) and &quot;First Men in the Moon&quot; (1964), as well as continuing to write for television, including two further &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, until 1997.

Kneale credited the director Rudolph Cartier with bringing to the screen in &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, with its ambitious location filming, an expansive style that had not been seen in British television drama beforehand. Cartier worked with Kneale again on the third &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, in 1958, and had subsequent successes with plays such as &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1961), &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1961) and &quot;Lee Oswald – Assassin&quot; (1966). He continued directing for television until the 1970s.

== Episodes ==
== Production ==
On 22 September 1955 the ITV network was launched in the UK, bringing commercial television to Britain for the first time and ending the BBC&#x27;s broadcasting monopoly in the country. The new network&#x27;s creation had been established by the Television Act 1954, and the BBC had known in advance that it would need programmes to combat the new rival for television audiences. Referring to the 1953 science-fiction serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; in a memo written in 1954, BBC Television&#x27;s Controller of Programmes, Cecil McGivern, noted that: &quot;Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while [&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;] lasted. We are going to need &quot;many&quot; more &#x27;Quatermass Experiment&#x27; programmes&quot;.

Having recently signed a two-year extension to his BBC staff writer&#x27;s contract, Nigel Kneale was specifically commissioned to write a sequel to &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; in early 1955 to challenge the new ITV network. Kneale was inspired by contemporary fears over secret UK Ministry of Defence research establishments such as Porton Down, and also by being required, as a BBC staff member, to sign the Official Secrets Act. As with &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, &quot;Quatermass II&quot; was produced and directed by Rudolph Cartier; he and Kneale particularly enjoyed working together. Since the first &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial, the two men had collaborated on the literary adaptations &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1953) and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1954), and on Kneale&#x27;s abominable snowman play &quot;The Creature&quot; (1955).

&quot;Quatermass II&quot; comprised six half-hour episodes, transmitted live from Studio G at the BBC&#x27;s Lime Grove Studios in London. The episodes – individually subtitled &quot;The Bolts&quot;, &quot;The Mark&quot;, &quot;The Food&quot;, &quot;The Coming&quot;, &quot;The Frenzy&quot; and &quot;The Destroyers&quot; – were shown every Saturday night at 8 p.m. from 22 October to 26 November 1955; because of the live nature of the performances, most of the episodes overran their allotted half-hour slots slightly. Each episode was rehearsed on the Monday to Friday before transmission at Mansergh Woodall Boys Club in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, and then camera rehearsed in studio for most of the day on the Saturday.

Not every scene was performed live; because of the increased budget – £7,552 was spent on the serial, nearly double the amount spent on &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; – Cartier was able to include a larger proportion of pre-filmed inserts on 35 mm film, which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot on location at the Shell Haven oil refinery in Stanford-le-Hope, doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural Essex for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction BBC Television Centre in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.

Each episode of &quot;Quatermass II&quot; was telerecorded onto 35 mm film during its live transmission, for a scheduled repeat the following Monday night at 10:15 p.m. All six episodes survive intact in the BBC&#x27;s archives, although the telerecording copies in some cases suffer from poor quality sound and vision. Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats. &quot;Quatermass II&quot; was one of the first BBC drama productions to be repeated from a telerecording, rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.

Episode three, &quot;The Food&quot;, was repeated in a slightly edited form on BBC 2 on 26 August 1991 as part of &quot;The Lime Grove Story&quot;. This was a day of programming to commemorate the closure of the studios after 40 years of use by the BBC.

== Reception and influence ==
The available British television audience had doubled since &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; had been shown in 1953, and the viewing figures for &quot;Quatermass II&quot; were accordingly higher. The serial gained an audience of 7.9 million viewers for its first three episodes, rising to 8.3 million for the fourth and fifth and concluding with 9 million. A BBC audience research report commissioned after &quot;Quatermass II&quot; had finished found that 90% of those questioned in the sample had watched at least five episodes of the production.

&quot;Quatermass II&quot; received positive newspaper reviews in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, although the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Radio Times&quot; listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt it to be not as good as the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode&#x27;s transmission she was due to move to Ireland to spend the rest of her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline&#x27;s conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass&#x27;s survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.

The BBC&#x27;s own website regarded &quot;Quatermass II&quot; unfavourably when reviewing its DVD release in 2005: &quot;The script is too often let down by the production&#x27;s rougher edges. Your heart will break halfway through episode six as it all falls apart. And then there&#x27;s Monica Gray [sic] – less an actress than a finishing school on legs&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2006, Morgan Falconer claimed to find racist undertones in the serial: &quot;Quatermass, for instance, often seemed to have an unhealthy preoccupation with blackness, a barely veiled commentary on racial change in Britain. In one scene in &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, the Professor stands outside a pub and watches the sky fill with dark asteroids. &#x27;They&#x27;re coming in their thousands&#x27;, he says, &#x27;this is it&#x27;&quot;. However, this interpretation of the serial is not widespread, and is undermined in episode five where an Irish immigrant helps Quatermass sabotage the aliens&#x27; food supply system. In any case, it is in direct contrast with Kneale&#x27;s deliberate attack on racial intolerance in &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;.

Speaking in a 2003 television documentary about Nigel Kneale&#x27;s career, the writer and critic Kim Newman praised the underlying themes of &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, and their particular relevance to the British way of life: &quot;&quot;Quatermass II&quot; is the British &quot;Invasion of the Bodysnatchers&quot;, but I don&#x27;t necessarily think that&#x27;s a bad thing... What &quot;Quatermass II&quot; does is take that metaphor and apply it to the specific conditions of Britain in the 1950s; not just the Cold War paranoia, but the traditional British grumbling resentment of bureaucracy as represented by the council, or in this case big business&quot;. The British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Screenonline&quot; website also offers praise in its analysis of the serial:&quot;With its tale of an invasion by an invisible enemy indistinguishable from ourselves, Kneale&#x27;s story tapped into contemporary fears about the &#x27;red&#x27; (i.e. communist) threat, although in a less direct way than the American science fiction films of the 1950s, including &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;. At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age – the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British nuclear weapons tests). In short, &quot;Quatermass II&quot; was the perfect cold-war drama&quot;.

Some science fiction fans have speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and &quot;Quatermass II&quot; in particular – with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government&#x27;s plans – influenced the successful American series &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1993–2002). Kneale was invited to write for &quot;The X-Files&quot; during the 1990s, but declined the offer.

Other genre productions that have been compared with the serial include the 1970 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;. This serial features an alien entity falling to Earth in a meteorite shower; a factory taken over for the growth of the alien creature, and governmental institutions being infiltrated by servants of the aliens.

== Other media ==
As with &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, the film rights to the serial were purchased by Hammer Film Productions – in this case after they had only read the scripts, before the serial was even made. Titled &quot;Quatermass 2&quot;, the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by Val Guest, with Brian Donlevy starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the screenplay himself. In the United States, the film was released under the title &quot;Enemy from Space&quot;.

Shortly after &quot;Quatermass II&quot; finished its run, comedian Bob Monkhouse included a spoof of the serial in an episode of his own BBC television series, which featured Monica Grey reprising her role as Paula Quatermass. Cartier and Kneale were greatly displeased with this and complained to their superiors at the BBC about it.

Quatermass returned to the BBC in 1958 when Kneale&#x27;s third serial, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, began transmission. That was the last television appearance of the character for 20 years, until Kneale brought Quatermass back for a final time in the 1979 serial &quot;Quatermass&quot;, this time produced for Thames Television.

A serialised novelisation of &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, written by Kneale, ran in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper in the UK from 5 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw the storyline to a premature conclusion as the paper lost interest in the project. The television scripts were released by Penguin Books in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included. The book was re-released in 1979, with a new introduction by Kneale, to coincide with the transmission of the Thames Television serial.

In April 2005 BBC Worldwide released a DVD box set of all its existing &quot;Quatermass&quot; material. This included digitally restored versions of all six episodes of &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, with the sound and vision of the telerecording copies cleaned up as far as possible, and some of the existing special effects inserts that survived on their original film elements being re-inserted into the episodes.

In 2016 BBC Store released &quot;Quatermass II&quot; and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;.

<text>Shirley Elizabeth Collins MBE (born 5 July 1935) is an English folk singer who was a significant contributor to the British Folk Revival of the 1960s and 1970s. She often performed and recorded with her sister Dolly, whose accompaniment on piano and portative organ created unique settings for Shirley&#x27;s plain, austere singing style.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Shirley Collins was born in Hastings, East Sussex, England on 5 July 1935. Her father left the family when she was about twelve or thirteen, and her Uncle Fred, who was an author, largely took his place. She grew up, with her older sister Dolly, in the area, in a family which kept alive a great love of traditional song. Songs learnt from their grandfather and from their mother&#x27;s sister, Grace Winborn, were to be important in the sisters&#x27; repertoire throughout their career.

On leaving school, at the age of 17, Collins enrolled at a teachers&#x27; training college in Tooting, south London. In London she also involved herself in the early folk revival, making her first appearance on vinyl on the 1955 compilation &quot;Folk Song Today&quot;.

In 1954, at a party hosted by Ewan MacColl, she met Alan Lomax, the American folk song collector, who had moved to Britain to avoid the McCarthy witch-hunt, which was then raging in America. Lomax and Collins lived together in London, with Collins assisting Lomax on various European projects and singing backing vocals on a version of MacColl&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; by Alan Lomax and the Ramblers, in 1956. &quot;I was madly in love with him&quot;, Collins says of Lomax.

=== First albums ===
In 1958 Collins recorded her first two albums, &quot;Sweet England&quot; and &quot;False True Lovers&quot;, featuring sparse arrangements, with Collins accompanying herself on the banjo. &quot;Sweet England&quot; was released in 1959 and &quot;False True Lovers&quot; in 1960. Collins also recorded a series of EPs in 1958 and 1959 with &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot; and &quot;English Songs&quot; being released in 1959.

From July to November 1959, Collins and Lomax made a folk song collecting trip in the Southern U.S. states. It resulted in many hours of recordings, featuring performers such as Almeda Riddle, Hobart Smith, and Bessie Jones, and is noted for the discovery of Mississippi Fred McDowell. Recordings from this trip were issued by Atlantic Records under the title &quot;Sounds of the South&quot;, and some were re-enacted in the Coen brothers’ film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;. The experience of her life with Lomax, and the making of the recordings in religious communities, social gatherings, prisons and chain gangs was described in Collins&#x27; book &quot;America Over the Water&quot; (published 2005).

Back in Britain, Collins met Austin John Marshall, whom she later married. She also proceeded with her singing career, appearing on three compilations albums (&quot;A Jug of Punch&quot;, &quot;A Pinch of Salt&quot; and &quot;Rocket Along&quot;) in 1960 and an EP, &quot;Heroes in Love&quot;, in 1963 (now included with &quot;False True Lovers&quot; on the CD release). It was after that, in a series of influential albums, that she helped to introduce many innovations into the English folk revival. In 1964, she recorded the landmark jazz-folk fusion of &quot;Folk Roots, New Routes&quot;, with guitarist Davey Graham.

&quot;English Songs Volume 2&quot; and &quot;Shirley Sings Irish&quot; were both released in 1964.

=== &quot;The Sweet Primeroses&quot; ===
1967 saw the essentially southern English song collection, &quot;The Sweet Primeroses&quot;, with Collins accompanied for the first time by her sister Dolly&#x27;s portative organ. 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Power of the True Love Knot&quot; also featured Dolly&#x27;s accompaniment. 1969 brought another collaboration, &quot;The Holly Bears the Crown,&quot; this time with The Young Tradition – featuring, in addition to Dolly Collins, Peter Bellamy, Heather Wood, and Royston Wood. This album was not released until 1995.

=== &quot;Anthems in Eden&quot; ===
&quot;Anthems in Eden&quot; was released in 1969, the first album to be credited to Shirley and Dolly Collins. It featured a suite of songs centred on the changes in rural England brought about by the First World War. Dolly Collins created arrangements featuring David Munrow and various other players from his Early Music Consort. The unusual combination of ancient instruments included rebecs, sackbuts, viols and crumhorns. All these recordings strove to marry a deep love and understanding of the English folk music heritage with a more contemporary attitude to musical settings.

&quot;Anthems in Eden&quot; was followed by &quot;Love, Death and the Lady&quot;, also co-credited with Dolly, in 1970.

=== Albion Country and Etchingham Steam Bands ===
Collins married her second husband Ashley Hutchings in 1971. He left Steeleye Span that year and he and Collins assembled the first incarnation of the Albion Country Band to accompany her on the 1971 album &quot;No Roses&quot;, with a total of 27 musicians participating over numerous sessions. Collins also provided guest vocals on the Hutchings project &quot;Morris On&quot; in 1972. Following the breakup of a later version of the Albion Country band in 1973 (shortly after recording the album Battle of the Field) the couple created the all acoustic Etchingham Steam Band with Terry Potter, Ian Holder and Vic Gammon, in 1974.

The couple were living in Etchingham at the time and the decision to eschew electricity was inspired by the Three-Day Week. The Etchingham&#x27;s repertoire was drawn from the traditional music of Sussex. The only recording by the band available at the time appeared on the 1974 compilation album &quot;A Favourite Garland&quot;, although Terry Potter and Ian Holder (as well as Simon Nicol and Roger Swallow, formerly of the Albion Country Band) appear on some tracks on &quot;Adieu to Old England&quot;, a Collins album also released in 1974 (and produced by Ashley Hutchings). Live recordings of the Etchingham Steam Band from 1974 and 1975 were released on a self-titled CD in 1995.

A largely new group of musicians (with some participation from Etchingham Steam Band members) was assembled for two 1976 releases: the &quot;Morris On&quot; follow up &quot;Son of Morris On&quot; (with Collins again providing vocals); and the newly recorded tracks for the Shirley and Dolly Collins album &quot;Amaranth&quot; (half of which was a reissue of the side-long suite of songs from &quot;Anthems in Eden&quot;). The involvement of Philip Pickett and John Sothcott in these recordings saw a return to the use of early music instruments. The bulk of the musicians became The Albion Dance Band, performing traditional material on a mixture of modern (electric) and early music instruments, with Collins on vocals. They recorded the album &quot;The Prospect Before Us&quot; and a BBC session in 1976, with a single (&quot;Hopping Down in Kent&quot;, Roud 1715) released that year and the album following in 1977. Live recordings from this period were released on the CD &quot;Dancing Days are Here Again&quot; in 2007.

=== Retirement ===
1978&#x27;s &quot;For As Many As Will&quot; was the last studio album recorded by Shirley and Dolly Collins, although live recordings from 1979 have been issued since, and in 1979 she released a single, &quot;The Mariner&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, with Bert Jansch. Collins does not appear on the next Albion Band album (&quot;Rise Up Like the Sun&quot;, recorded in 1977 and released in 1978, with the &quot;Dance&quot; dropped from the band name) and decided to focus on home life and her children from her first marriage whilst Hutchings and the Albion Band collaborated on several National Theatre productions. It was during this period that Hutchings left Collins. The painful divorce was followed by loss of her voice and &quot;the ability to sing entirely&quot;, through dysphonia, leading to her retirement from music.

Her music career seemingly over, Collins resorted to &quot;a number of low-paid jobs&quot;—including employment at the British Library and the job centre—to get by, and she sold her old equipment.

She made one last appearance with the Albion Band, on the 1980 album &quot;Lark Rise to Candleford&quot; (the soundtrack of the plays). In 1993 David Tibet of the apocalyptic folk band Current 93 released a collection of her recordings, entitled &quot;Fountain of Snow&quot;, on his Durtro label. Since then, she has appeared on a number of Current 93 recordings.

=== 21st century ===

Collins sang on the final version of &quot;Idumæa&quot; on Current 93&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Black Ships Ate the Sky&quot;. In 2009 Topic Records included in their 70-year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot; two tracks from &quot;The Sweet Primeroses&quot;: &quot;All Things Are Quite Silent&quot; and &quot;The Rigs of the Time&quot;.

With actor Pip Barnes, she toured with her three illustrated talks &quot;America over the Water&quot; (about her field trip in the Southern States of America with Alan Lomax), &quot;A Most Sunshiny Day&quot; (about the traditional music of England and Sussex in particular), and &quot;I&#x27;m a Romany Rai&quot; (about the Gypsy singers and songs of Southern England). She also edited a CD entitled &quot;I&#x27;m a Romany Rai&quot; (2012) in the series The Voice of the People.

In 2013, Collins appeared on Justin Hopper&#x27;s text composition, &quot;Fourth River: Ley Line&quot;, to be released on the Contraphonic Sound Series. On 8 February 2014, at Union Chapel, Islington in London, Collins sang for the first time for many years, performing two songs; &quot;All the Pretty Little Horses&quot; and &quot;Death and the Lady&quot;. She was accompanied by Ian Kearey from the band Oysterband.

She returned to recording and in November 2016, Collins released &quot;Lodestar&quot;, her first new album in 38 years. Earning two BBC Radio 2 Folk Award nominations for the work, considered her best by some, she found this late success highly improbable, saying: &quot;I never believed it could happen. It&#x27;s a bit of a miracle, really&quot;.

&quot;Lodestar&quot; was followed in July 2020 by another album of new material, entitled &quot;Heart&#x27;s Ease&quot;. The album included re-recordings of some songs she had sung in her twenties, such as &quot;Barbara Allen&quot;. In a five-star review, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;...a more confident follow-up [to &quot;Lodestar&quot;]&quot;, saying: &quot;The veteran singer&#x27;s comeback really takes wing with this impeccably judged set&quot;.

Another album of new recordings, &quot;Archangel Hill&quot;, was released in May 2023, featuring songs chosen by Collins - some traditional and some by her favourite modern writers.

In August 2023 Collins was the guest for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, where her choices included &quot;61 Highway Blues&quot; by Mississippi Fred McDowell, &quot;A Heart Needs A Home&quot; by Richard and Linda Thompson and &quot;The Birds in the Spring&quot; by the Copper Family.

== &quot;The Ballad of Shirley Collins&quot; ==
A film about her life, &quot;The Ballad of Shirley Collins&quot;, was released in October 2017. She was not sure such attention was warranted, saying: &quot;When they first asked me I was nonplussed. I thought, &#x27;is this a wind-up?’”

==Honours, awards, distinctions==
* In 2004, Collins was awarded a Gold Badge by the English Folk Dance and Song Society. 
* She was awarded the MBE for services to music in the 2007 New Year&#x27;s Honours List. 
* She holds an Honorary Degree from the Open University (for a &quot;notable contribution to education and culture&quot;) and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Sussex. 
* In 2008 she was elected as president of the English Folk Dance and Song Society and received the &quot;Good Tradition&quot; award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. 
* She is currently patron of the South East Folk Arts Network and Folk South West.
* Collins garnered two BBC Radio 2 Folk Award nominations for her seventh studio album, &quot;Lodestar&quot;, released in 2016.
* A film about her life, &quot;The Ballad of Shirley Collins&quot;, was released in October 2017.

==Influence==
The American folk-rock band 10,000 Maniacs did a cover of &quot;Just as the Tide was Flowing&quot;, closely modelled on the version on the &quot;No Roses&quot; album.

Billy Bragg said of her: &quot;Shirley Collins is without doubt one of England&#x27;s greatest cultural treasures.&quot;

Few singers of the English folk revival have attempted as much on record as Collins – an extraordinary combination of fragility and power. &quot;I like music to be fairly straightforward, simply embellished – the performance without histrionics allowing you to think about the song rather than telling you what to think.&quot;

Colin Meloy of The Decemberists recorded a whole EP of Shirley Collins tunes. It was sold on Meloy&#x27;s 2006 spring United States tour in limited quantities.

<doc id="869160" wikidata="Q1753511" url="?curid=869160" title="The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl">
<text>The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl is a live album by the Beatles, released in May 1977, featuring songs compiled from three performances recorded at the Hollywood Bowl in August 1964 and August 1965. The album was released by Capitol Records in the United States and Canada and on the Parlophone label in the United Kingdom. It was the band&#x27;s first official live recording. A remixed, remastered, and expanded version of the album, retitled Live at the Hollywood Bowl, was released on 9 September 2016, on CD for the first time, to coincide with the release of the documentary film &quot;The Beatles: Eight Days a Week&quot;, directed by Ron Howard.

==Background==
Capitol Records considered recording the Beatles&#x27; February 1964 concert at Carnegie Hall in New York, but it could not get the necessary approval from the American Federation of Musicians. Six months later, KRLA DJ Bob Eubanks booked the band&#x27;s performance of 23 August at the Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angeles, where Capitol recorded their performance with the aim of releasing a live album in America. The sound quality of the tapes proved to be inadequate for commercial release, however, although Capitol used a 48-second excerpt of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; from the concert on the 1964 documentary album &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot;.

High-quality black-and-white film of the 1964 show was also made and preserved. Excerpts of &quot;All My Loving&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; from the 23 August 1964 performance appeared in &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; documentary series (1995).
When the Beatles returned to the Hollywood Bowl a year later, during their 1965 American tour, Capitol recorded two performances by the group at the same venue. The sound quality of the 1965 recordings was equally disappointing.

The Beatles were among the few major recording artists of the 1960s not to have issued a live album. Consequently, among Beatles fans, pent-up demand for a concert album continued to build. John Lennon set off a minor frenzy when, in a 1971 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, he incorrectly identified an obscure Italian compilation album, &quot;The Beatles in Italy&quot;, as a live recording (&quot;There&#x27;s one in Italy apparently, that somebody recorded there&quot;). Despite the obvious demand for a live album, the tapes from the three Hollywood Bowl performances lay untouched in a Capitol vault. In 1971, after American record producer Phil Spector&#x27;s salvaging of the &quot;Get Back&quot; tapes, which was released as the group&#x27;s &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, the Hollywood Bowl tapes were given to him to see whether he could fashion an album from the material. Either Spector did not complete the job or his production was unsatisfactory, and the tapes sat unreleased for another six years.

A complete tape of the August 1964 performance found its way out of the Capitol vault in the early 1970s and was the basis of a popular bootleg LP, &quot;Back in 64 at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;. The audio, while below professional release standards, was more than adequate for desperate hardcore fans and served for years as the standard recording of the summer 1964 tour.

Finally, with a rival record label&#x27;s impending release of the &quot;Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962&quot; album, consisting of a 15-year-old, poor-quality mono concert recording of the group performing in the Star-Club in Hamburg, Capitol Records&#x27; president, Bhaskar Menon, decided to revisit the Hollywood Bowl recordings. Beatles producer George Martin was handed the tapes and asked to compile a listenable &quot;official&quot; live album.

When Martin heard the tapes, he was impressed by the performances but disappointed by the sound quality. In working on the three-track Hollywood Bowl concert tapes, Martin discovered quite a challenge. The first difficulty was finding a working three-track machine with which to play them. Once he found one, he discovered that the machine overheated when it was running, melting the magnetic tape. Martin and recording engineer Geoff Emerick came up with the solution of blowing air from a vacuum cleaner to keep the tape deck cool whilst the recordings were transferred to 16-track tape for filtering, equalisation, editing, and mixing.

Although the original album sleeve says that the recordings were all made on 23 August 1964 and 30 August 1965, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot; were recorded on 29 August 1965, and &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot; is a composite using parts from both nights in 1965.

A number of songs performed at the 23 August 1964 and 30 August 1965 concerts were not included on the album. Songs from the 23 August 1964 show that were not on the album are &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;If I Fell&quot;, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, and &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Songs from the 30 August 1965 show that were not on the album are &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot;, &quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;. &quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot; from the 30 August 1965 concert was issued as the B-side of the &quot;Real Love&quot; single (1996), and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; from the 1964 concert was mixed into the studio version of the song for the &quot;Love&quot; album (2006). Those two performances, along with the 1964 performance of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; and the 30 August 1965 &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot;, were included on &quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, in 2016.

==Release==
The album was originally released as a vinyl LP on 4 May 1977. Though the recordings were 12 and 13 years old, the album reached number one on the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; chart in the UK and number two on the Billboard chart in the US. In France, a single was released featuring two songs from the LP: &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; with &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot; on the B-side.

As of 12 June 1977, it was one of three live albums in the Top Ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, alongside &quot;Barry Manilow Live&quot; (at number seven) and Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Live at the London Palladium&quot; (at number nine), with the Beatles at number two.

The original 1977 album was also officially released simultaneously on 8-track tape and cassette but was not officially released on compact disc until 9 September 2016, when it was re-released worldwide as &quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;. Shortly before the re-release date, a number of tracks were available for purchase and streaming early, and the album was available for pre-order on the iTunes Store. The re-released album was simultaneously released as a digital download and made available on streaming services. It was also released on vinyl on 18 November 2016.

A music video of the performance of &quot;Boys&quot; was released to promote the remixed album.

Before the official digital release of the album, bootleggers circulated transfers of the LP, and complete recordings of the three concerts, on CD and the Internet.

===&quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;===

&quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; is a remixed and remastered version of the album, released on 9 September 2016 to coincide with the release of &quot;The Beatles: Eight Days a Week&quot;. It includes four additional songs not found on the original release. According to the producer, Giles Martin, son of the Beatles&#x27; original producer, George Martin, &quot;Capitol Studios called saying they&#x27;d discovered some Hollywood Bowl three track tapes in their archive. We transferred them and noticed an improvement over the tapes we&#x27;ve kept in the London archive. Alongside this I&#x27;d been working for some time with a team headed by technical engineer James Clarke on demix technology, the ability to remove and separate sounds from a single track.&quot; It was released on 9 September 2016, seven years to the day after the release of the band&#x27;s remastered core catalogue and &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot;.

One of the bonus tracks on the album is &quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot; from the &quot;Real Love&quot; single CD, which was previously unavailable on an album or as a digital download.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, Al Rudis opined that while all of the songs are on other Beatles albums in better quality, Beatles fans would still want the live album to complete their collections or for reminiscing, and are &quot;bound to pull it out again&quot; in later years to show their grandchildren. Rudis says that while the &quot;sloppiness&quot; of the album may stem from the Beatles being unable to decipher their performance properly over the primitive amplification and monitoring systems, the atmosphere of the concert – such as the excited fans and &quot;bemused wonderment of the boys&quot; – comes through. Cliff Radel of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; comments that the &quot;harpyesque screaming&quot; lasts throughout the album, but as it progresses, the screams &quot;fade from the listener&#x27;s consciousness [and] become white noise. But their presence never completely departs.&quot; Radel praised George Martin&#x27;s &quot;fine job&quot; in &quot;remixing, filtering, equalizing and transferring the three-track tapes to the multi-track techniques of 1977.&quot;

&quot;The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; was voted the 26th best record of 1977 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s supervisor, ranked it 12th on his own year-end list, and in a review for the newspaper, he wrote:

In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Rob Sheffield called the record &quot;a loving tribute to the screaming girl fans who drown out the band in these 1964–65 shows; those girls were heroes on the rock &amp; roll frontier, and they deserve to be the lead instrument on a Beatles album of their own.&quot; AllMusic critic Richard S. Ginell was impressed by the Beatles&#x27; performances under the chaotic circumstances, although he lamented the sound quality and separation from the crowd noise, citing it as a possible reason for the record remaining out of print. In their 2015 list of the &quot;greatest lost albums&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot; write that while the album is &quot;scarcely a hi-fi listening experience&quot;, it is a revelatory listen because it showcases thirteen &quot;raw, R&#x27;n&#x27;B-weighted tracks&quot; that are clearly audible and prove &quot;what a spookily tight, breathlessly exciting live act they could be. Great between-song patter, as well.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Gwilym Mumford writes that while the original 1977 is regarded as one of the weaker Beatles albums, the 2016 remix emboldens both the melodic and muscular, proto-punk qualities of the band&#x27;s live sound.

==Legacy==
Commenting on the &quot;nonstop screaming of fans&quot; through the album, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; write that &quot;aside from its value as a document of what a Beatles show actually sounded like, the album anticipated a whole generation of music by British shoegazer bands like My Bloody Valentine and the Jesus and Mary Chain, with catchy songs almost completely drowned out by white noise.&quot; Michael Hann of &quot;The Guardian&quot; also compared the album to the Jesus and Mary Chain, due to &quot;the screams of thousands and thousands of teenagers, screams that blanket the music in sheets of white noise, for all the world like William Reid&#x27;s feedback on &quot;Psychocandy&quot;.&quot; My Bloody Valentine guitarist Kevin Shields was inspired by &quot;The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; after hearing the album as a child and being fascinated by the band&#x27;s music being largely concealed beneath the noise of screaming fans, and that this was one influence on his intention to create &quot;the most beautiful songs with the most extremeness of physicality and sound&quot;, leading to the fuzz-drenched sound of &quot;Loveless&quot; (1991). Shields also sampled the audience screams from the Beatles album on My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s &quot;Clair&quot; (1987), burying the song beneath them.

<text>Battlefield Band is a Scottish traditional music group. Founded in Glasgow in 1969, they have released over 30 albums and undergone many changes of lineup. As of 2010, none of the original founders remain in the band.

The band is noted for their combination of bagpipes with other non-traditional instruments, such as electronic keyboards, and for its mix of traditional songs and new material. Battlefield Band toured internationally, playing to audiences in Europe, Australia, Asia, the Middle East, and North America.

They have collaborated with other musicians including the Scottish harp player and glass sculptor Alison Kinnaird.

== History ==

===Career===
Battlefield Band was formed in 1969 by five student friends from Strathclyde University (Brian McNeill, Jim Thomson, Alan Reid, Eddie Morgan and Sandra Lang, who became crime fiction author Alex Gray) and took its name from the area in the south of Glasgow where McNeill was living at the time. After several line-up changes and an album recorded for a minor Breton label, the band was signed to Topic records and released its official self-titled debut in 1977 with the line-up of McNeill (fiddle, vocals), Reid (keyboards, vocals), Jamie McMenemy (bouzouki, vocals), and John Gahagan (whistle). Gahagan left before the recording of the follow-up, &quot;At the Front&quot; (1978), and was replaced by Irish singer-guitarist Pat Kilbride. The departure of both Kilbride and McMenemy shortly afterward brought in Jen Clark (vocals, cittern, dulcimer) and Duncan MacGillivray (Highland pipes) for &quot;Stand Easy&quot; (1979), thus beginning Battlefield Band&#x27;s tradition of using bagpipes on their albums. Clark was replaced by Northumbrian singer-guitarist Ged Foley on &quot;Home is Where the Van Is&quot; (1980), which marked a switch from Topic records to producer Robin Morton&#x27;s label Temple. &quot;Home is Where the Van Is&quot; also inaugurated the band&#x27;s practice of placing original songs alongside traditional material. The line-up changes continued, though the group remained based around the core of McNeill and Reid until 1990, when McNeill left to pursue a solo career. Reid finally left the band at the end of 2010, concentrating on his musical duo with guitarist &amp; singer Rob van Sante, the Battlefield Band&#x27;s sound engineer.

===Last years===
On 1 January 2015, Battlefield Band revealed in an e-mail sent to their fanbase that, back from their US tour in October/November 2014, they were working hard in the studio on a new recording project with the working title &quot;Beg, Borrow &amp; Steal&quot;. The Irish / Scottish album would highlight and explore the cultural cross-fertilisation of the vibrant musical traditions of Scotland &amp; Ireland and the group would collaborate with many other leading traditional musicians and scholars. Mick Moloney (USA/Ireland), Nuala Kennedy (Ireland), Aaron Jones (Ireland), Christine Primrose (Scotland), Alison Kinnaird (Scotland) &amp; Barry Gray (Australia) were due to be all on board, with more to follow. The band has been awarded Creative Scotland assistance for this project. If all would have gone well as initially announced and expected, the recordings would have been available on Temple Records by March 2015 – it might even have turned into a tour if all would have gone well and the musicians would have been available.

On 22 June 2015, on their Twitter page, Battlefield Band announced a January 2016 (11-date) tour of Germany, Switzerland and Austria due to begin on 14 January in Offenburg, Germany and end on 31 January 2016 in Hamburg, Germany. This would be Battlefield Band&#x27;s return to the stage for the first time since November 2014 i.e. after more than a year of inactivity as the band had not toured during the whole year 2015...

On 14 August 2015, Battlefield Band&#x27;s label Temple Records finally announced that the (delayed) new album had been re-titled simply as &quot;Beg &amp; Borrow&quot; and would be released as a digital download (and on streaming) on 21 August 2015, on CD in the UK on 18 September 2015 and on CD in the United States on 16 October 2015.

Battlefield Band later confirmed that they would embark on 14 January 2016 on a 16-date tour of German-speaking countries (Germany, German-speaking Switzerland, Austria) including a radio show and a TV show in Germany, due to end on 31 January 2016.

After having performed an ultimate show on Sunday 13 August 2017 (7.30pm) during the Scotland Piping Live! festival at The National Piping Centre in Glasgow, Scotland (as the festival closing concert), the band went dormant with no explanation whatsoever from the official web site.

== Accolades ==
Battlefield Band were winners of &quot;Best Live Act&quot; at the inaugural Scots Trad Music Awards in 2003. In 2011, they were winners of &quot;Best Band&quot; at the Scots Trad Music Awards 2011.

Battlefield Band&#x27;s &quot;Compliments to Buddy McMaster&quot; (a track from its album &quot;Dookin&#x27;&quot; released in 2007) was nominated for the 7th Annual Independent Music Awards for World Traditional Song of the year. They also have been nominated for the 11th Independent Music Awards &quot;World Traditional Song&quot; category for its recording of &quot;A&#x27; Bhriogais Uallach&quot; (&quot;The Pompous Trousers&quot;), a track from their album &quot;Line-up&quot; released in 2011.

On 11 November 2016, Battlefield Band were inducted into Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame for &quot;Services to Performance&quot;.

== Instruments and themes ==
Every line-up since the &quot;Stand Easy&quot; album has had at least one bagpiper. Unusual aspects of the instrumental line-up for a traditional band include the presence of electric keyboards and the absence of percussion. Every album mixes traditional Scottish songs and tunes with modern (often original) compositions. Themes range from drinking, friendship, and hard times to history, geography and politics.

The band&#x27;s 2006 album, &quot;The Road of Tears&quot;, deals explicitly with the theme of displacement. Many of the songs deal with emigration, both voluntary and forced. Battlefield Band&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Dookin′&quot; (the Scots word for what you do at hallowe&#x27;en – as in &quot;&#x27;dookin&#x27; for apples&quot;) has a lighter feel, after the eloquently somber tone of &quot;The Road of Tears&quot;. &quot;Dookin&quot;&#x27; includes instrumentals and a mix of vocals, with lead being shared by Alan Reid and Sean O&#x27;Donnell.

<text>John Robinson (11 November 1908 – 6 March 1979) was an English actor, who was particularly active in the theatre. Mostly cast in minor and supporting roles in film and television, he is best remembered for being the second actor to play the famous television science-fiction role of Professor Bernard Quatermass, in the 1955 BBC Television serial &quot;Quatermass II&quot;.

==Biography==
Robinson was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England. His first professional appearance came in his home city in 1929, at the Liverpool Playhouse. He appeared in a variety of stage productions in London throughout the 1930s. These included &quot;Black Limelight&quot; by Gordon Sherry at the Q Theatre in 1937, where his role as Peter Charrington was described by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper&#x27;s critic as &quot;a skilful, reticent sketch&quot;. In 1939, he played Fortinbras in John Gielgud&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the final play to be performed at the Lyceum Theatre before its closure.

He made his film debut in 1936 in &quot;The Scarab Murder Case&quot;, and during the 1930s he also began appearing on radio and in the newer medium of television. In the Second World War he took part in the D-Day landings in 1944, as a member of the Reconnaissance Corps. He returned to acting in 1949, as John Beresford in the TV production of &quot;Elizabeth of Ladymead&quot;, appearing in several films and increasingly on television again. One of his best film roles (with higher billing than usual) was as the villain with redeeming qualities in &quot;Hammer the Toff&quot; (1952).

In August 1955, the actor Reginald Tate died the month before he was due to start work on &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, having played the part of the Professor in the first instalment of the series, &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. With only a short amount of time to cast a replacement, director Rudolph Cartier offered Robinson the role, as the only suitable actor available. Robinson had some difficulty with the technical dialogue he was required to learn, and was also uneasy about taking over a role that had been established by Tate.

Robinson was not available to reprise the part for the third serial, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, in 1958, and André Morell took over the role. In the 1960s, Robinson starred in another science-fiction series, &quot;R3&quot;, which had some similarities to &quot;Quatermass&quot;.

Robinson compiled 56 film and television credits. His film appearances were usually minor parts, including uncredited roles in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (both 1962). Notable television appearances include starring roles on &quot;The Broken Horseshoe&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot; (1960) and two guest appearances on &quot;The Saint&quot; opposite Roger Moore. He was also a regular performer on both the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Theatre&quot; from 1951 to 1959, and ITV&#x27;s &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; from 1956 to 1965.

His final screen role was in the television series &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot; in 1974. He died of cancer in London in March 1979, aged 70.

<text>Sir Charles Sedley, 5th Baronet (March 1639 – 20 August 1701), was an English noble, dramatist and politician. He was principally remembered for his wit and profligacy.

==Life==
He was the son of Sir John Sedley, 2nd Baronet, of Aylesford in Kent, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Henry Savile. The Sedleys (also sometimes spelt Sidley) had been prominent in Kent since at least 1337. Sedley&#x27;s grandfather, William Sedley, was knighted in 1605 and created a baronet in 1611. He was the founder of the Sidleian Lectures of Natural Philosophy at Oxford.

Sedley was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, but left without taking a degree. There his tutor was the poet Walter Pope. The second surviving son of Sir John Sedley and Elizabeth, William, succeeded to the baronetcy in 1645.

Charles Sedley inherited the title (5th baronet) in 1656 when his brother William died. By his first wife Lady Katherine Savage, daughter of John, 2nd Earl Rivers he had only one legitimate child, Catherine, Countess of Dorchester, mistress of James II. The couple lived in Great Queen Street. After his first wife had been sent to a convent in Ghent on account of a serious mental condition, Sedley in vain tried to obtain a divorce.

He met Ann Ayscough, probably around 1670, by whom he had two illegitimate sons, William and Charles Sedley. William died in infancy, and the brother Charles was knighted by William III after the coronation in 1689 and created a baronet in 1702. The relationship with Ann Ayscough lasted to the end of Sedley&#x27;s life. Sedley died at Hampstead on 20 August 1701 and was buried at Southfleet Church on the 26th. The Sedley baronetcy became extinct on his death.

Sedley is famous as a patron of literature in the Restoration period, and was the Francophile Lisideius of Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Essay of Dramatic Poesy&quot;. However, it was above all Sedley&#x27;s wit that his contemporaries admired him for.

Sedley was reputed as a notorious rake and libertine, part of the &quot;Merry Gang&quot; of courtiers which included the Earl of Rochester and Lord Buckhurst. The gang engaged in acts that were violent, outraged public decency and often included violence against women.

In 1663 an indecent frolic in Bow Street, for which he was fined 2,000 marks, made Sedley notorious.

From the balcony of Oxford Kate&#x27;s Tavern he, Lord Buckhurst and Sir Thomas Ogle shocked and delighted a crowd of onlookers with their blasphemous and obscene antics. According to Samuel Pepys, Sedley &quot;showed his nakedness – and abusing of scripture and as it were from thence preaching a mountebank sermon from the pulpit, saying that there he had to sell such a pouder as should make all the cunts in town run after him, 1000 people standing underneath to see and hear him, and that being done he took a glass of wine and washed his prick in it and then drank it off, and then took another and drank the King&#x27;s health.&quot; This behaviour provoked a riot amongst the onlookers and condemnation in the courts, where the Lord Chief Justice gave his opinion that it was because of wretches like him &quot;that God&#x27;s anger and judgement hang over us&quot;.

Sedley was member of parliament for New Romney in Kent, and took an active and useful part in politics. A speech of his on the civil list after the Revolution is cited by Macaulay as proof that his reputation as a man of wit and ability was deserved. His &quot;bon mot&quot; at the expense of James II is well known. The king had seduced his daughter and created her countess of Dorchester, whereupon Sedley said: &quot;As the king has made my daughter a countess, the least I can do, in common gratitude, is to assist in making his Majesty&#x27;s daughter (Mary) a queen&quot;. Sedley is also occasionally associated with a notorious gang of unbridled revellers who called themselves &quot;Ballers&quot; and who were active between 1660 and 1670. It was probably Sedley who wrote the &quot;Ballers&#x27; Oath&quot; on their behalf.

Sedley&#x27;s parliamentary career started in the 1660s but around 1677/78 he joined the Whig cause. When Charles II died in 1685, Sedley was illegally excluded from the parliament of his successor James II, which convened in May 1685. There can be no doubt that Sedley opposed the Catholic James and supported William of Orange in the crucial year of 1688. Sedley was returned in the second Parliament of William, elected in March 1690. More speeches and parliamentary motions followed in 1690, including discussions on the Bill for regulating trials for High Treason, which sheds light on Sedley&#x27;s political commitment after the Revolution. Sedley&#x27;s speeches were included in the 1702 edition of &quot;The Miscellaneous Works&quot;. Sedley kept his seat in Parliament until his death in 1701.

==Family==
Charles Sedley inherited the title (5th baronet) in 1656 when his brother William died. By his first wife, Lady Katherine Savage, daughter of John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers, he had only one legitimate child, Catherine, Countess of Dorchester, who later became a mistress of James II of England. After his first wife had been sent to a convent in Ghent on account of a serious mental condition, Sedley tried in vain to obtain a divorce.

He met Ann Ayscough, probably around 1670, by whom he had two illegitimate sons, William and Charles Sedley. William died in infancy, and the brother Charles was knighted by William III of Orange after the coronation in 1689 and created a baronet in 1702. The relationship with Ann Ayscough lasted until the end of Sedley&#x27;s life.

==Legacy==
His reputation as a wit and dissolute was partially responsible for the Sedleys of William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

==Works==
===Poems===
His most famous song, &quot;Phyllis is My Only Joy&quot;, is much more widely known now than the author&#x27;s name. While Sedley chiefly produced light amatory verse and pastoral dialogues in the 1670s, he turned to satirical epigrams in the 1680s and 1690s. His &quot;Epigrams: or, Court Characters&quot; are modelled on the works of Martial. In his epigram &quot;To Nysus&quot;, for example, Sedley describes the function of satire and emphasizes the aggressive mode of satire: &quot;Let us write satyr than, and at our ease / Vex the ill-natur&#x27;d Fools we cannot please.&quot; At the same time, Sedley translated other specimens of ancient poetry, such as Virgil&#x27;s Georgics IV, the eighth Ode of the second Book of Horace and three elegies from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Amores&quot;. Dryden included Sedley&#x27;s translations from Ovid in the &quot;Miscellany&quot; of 1684.

A number of his poems have been set to music: &quot;Phyllis is My Only Joy&quot; in a glee by John William Hobbs (1799–1877), &quot;Not, Celia, that I Juster Am&quot; in a solo song by the English composer Elizabeth Turner (1700–1756), and &quot;Hears Not My Phillis&quot; (Knotting Song, Z.371) in a solo song by the English composer Henry Purcell (1659–1695). In 1692 Sedley wrote the birthday ode for Queen Mary, &quot;Love’s goddess sure was blind&quot;, which was also set to music by Purcell. The poem was printed in &quot;The Gentleman’s Journal&quot; of May 1692.

===Plays===
His first comedy, &quot;The Mulberry-Garden&quot; (1668), sustains Sedley&#x27;s contemporary reputation for wit in conversation. The best, but most licentious, of his comedies is &quot;Bellamira: or, The Mistress&quot; (1687), an imitation of the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; of Terence, in which the heroine is supposed to represent Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, the mistress of Charles II. While &quot;The Mulberry-Garden&quot; exuberantly praises the achievements of the Restoration, &quot;Bellamira&quot; displays a dark cynicism which has to be accounted for within a changed historical context. His two tragedies, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1677) and &quot;The Tyrant King of Crete&quot; (1702), an adaptation of Henry Killigrew&#x27;s &quot;Pallantus and Eudora&quot;, have little merit. He also produced &quot;The Grumbler&quot; (1702), an adaptation of &quot;Le Grondeur&quot; of Brueys and Palaprat. However, many contents of Sedley&#x27;s posthumous edition are spurious. Apart from the prologues of his own plays, Sedley wrote at least four more prologues to comedies, the best-known of which was written for Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;Epsom Wells&quot;.

<text>Varėna () is a city in Dzūkija, southern Lithuania.

==Etymology==
The name of the town comes from an old village - Senoji Varėna (at the time called simply Varėna), while the new, present Varėna was being established nearby. The place name itself comes from the name of the Varėnė River. In other languages, the town is referred to as:
; ; &quot;Oran&quot;.

==History==
The town was founded in 1862 near the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway, south of Sena Varėna (Old Varėna). At that time it was a small settlement, but following steady development it eventually became the center of the district. In the interbellum period, following World War I, the town was annexed by Poland, and renamed Orany. It was located near the then Polish-Lithuanian border, in the Wilno-Troki County (&quot;Powiat wileńsko-trocki&quot;) of the Wilno Voivodeship. In 1939, following the German-Soviet Invasion of Poland, Varėna was returned to Lithuania.

On September 9, 1942, all the Jews of the town of Varėna were collected in the local synagogue. On that day, even though the Germans had tried to prevent him from doing so, the priest Jonas Gylys entered the synagogue and encouraged the Jews to be brave in their last hours rather than convert to Christianity.

On the following day (or, according to another source, on the 9th itself) all of the Jews were taken from the synagogue to Ežeriekai - a grove of trees near the village of Druckūnai, from the town, on the side of the road leading to the village. Two large pits had been dug there apart, one for the men and one for the women. Germans forced the victims in groups toward the pits and shot them there.

According to the report of Karl Jaeger, commander of Einsatzkommando 3A, 831 Jews from Varėna (and the surrounding areas) – 541 men, 149 women, and 141 children – were killed on that day.

In 1946 around 2000 Poles were repatriated to Poland.

Following industrialization in the 1970s, the town grew rapidly. Currently there are 9,240 residents in Varėna. The Varėna district is the largest and most forested region in Lithuania.

==People==
* Lithuanian painter and composer Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis was born in Sena Varėna in 1875.

==Twin towns — Sister cities==
Varėna is twinned with:
* Mikołajki, Poland

<doc id="869171" wikidata="Q7347260" url="?curid=869171" title="Robert Maclellan, 1st Lord Kirkcudbright">
<text>Sir Robert MacLellan, born in Bombie, Kirkcudbright, Dumfries &amp; Galloway, Scotland, was the son of Thomas MacLellan of Bombie and Grisel Maxwell. Robert was the 1st Lord Kirkcudbright, a title he held from 1633 to 1639. Since he was underage in 1597, at the time of his father’s death, his guardian and tutor during his formative years was Sir William MacLellan of Auchlane.

== Biography ==

As early as 1594, Robert received a charter for Balgreddan Farm and by 1603, MacLellan was knighted by James VI of Scotland and was appointed to serve as a Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, a position at court that provided him significant influence. 

Robert married, first (contracted 18 and 26 October 1603), Agnes, the sixth daughter of Hugh, first Lord Loudoun; secondly, in 1614, Mary Montgomery, daughter of Hugh, 1st Viscount Montgomery of the Great Ards; she died before 1636, and he married, thirdly, Mary, daughter of Robert Gage of Raunds, Northamptonshire, widow, first, of John Rowley of Castleroe, County Londonderry, and secondly, of Sir George Trevelyan.

By 1607, MacLellan was already in a prominent public role, having been elected Provost of Kirkcudbright. His two terms as Provost (1606–1609 and 1611–1613) were marked by tumultuous and controversial actions. His first significant scandal occurred in July 1607 when, at a church session in Kirkcudbright, MacLellan assaulted Robert Glendinning, the minister, during a heated debate. This was part of an ongoing conflict with Robert Forrester, whose alleged adultery was being discussed at the session.

In another incident in August 1607, MacLellan, armed with pistols and other weapons, was accused of shooting at George Glendinning of Drumrash. This altercation led to a lengthy legal battle, where MacLellan was eventually ordered to pay compensation, but not before he retaliated with his own countercharges against the Glendinnings.

MacLellan&#x27;s life was defined by numerous clashes, many of them rooted in family rivalries and feuds. In 1608, he was accused of holding a grudge against his uncle, William MacLellan of Auchlane, and was charged with plotting his relative&#x27;s death. This tension was compounded by accusations that MacLellan had been lenient in allowing prisoners to remain free in Kirkcudbright, which further brought him before the Privy Council.

A series of legal troubles continued through 1608 and 1609, with accusations of assault, theft, and bloodshed. In April 1608, MacLellan&#x27;s involvement in an affray in Kirkcudbright led to him being fined and imprisoned in Blackness Castle. The situation worsened when he and his clan members were accused of attacking several men, including William Maxwell of Cavers and merchant Edward Edzer, in the streets of Kirkcudbright. MacLellan was subsequently found liable for these actions and was subjected to further fines and imprisonment, though some charges were dropped.

Despite a series of scandals and his violent reputation, MacLellan was also a skilled landowner. In 1610, he obtained lands in Ulster as part of the Scottish Plantation in Ireland, acquiring estates such as the Rosses in County Donegal and Ballycastle in County Londonderry—an estate belonging to the Haberdashers&#x27; Company—as well as the Clothworkers&#x27; Estate.

MacLellan spent much of his time in Ireland, overseeing the leasing of his lands and occasionally returning to Scotland to manage his estates. However, his financial troubles deepened, as the costs of the plantation were higher than anticipated, and he faced mounting debts. His involvement in Irish affairs continued into the 1620s, when he was granted a commission to raise troops for service in Ireland, and he sought reimbursements for the expenses incurred during military campaigns.

By the early 1620s, MacLellan was member of Parliament for the county of Wigtown and was appointed one of the commissioners for the small barons. He was also one of the Commissioners to oversee the customars of Galloway. Though his financial problems only became more pronounced. He was involved in several legal disputes over land transactions and debts. In 1621, he was summoned to court over the non-payment of 700 merks and was further embroiled in a dispute over land sales with Robert MacLellan of Nunton. These financial struggles led to multiple mortgages on his estates and an increasing reliance on loans.

In 1622, MacLellan became involved in an assault on a messenger who had come to serve him with legal papers related to his debts. The altercation led to another public scandal, resulting in his imprisonment at Edinburgh Castle. Despite these troubles, he continued to hold public office, becoming a Justice of the Peace for Kirkcudbright &amp; Wigtown and a Commissioner for the Middle Shires Borders.

In the years following his financial crisis, MacLellan’s role in public affairs gradually diminished, though he remained active in the pursuit of his rights. By 1629, he was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia. In 1633, by letters patent dated 26th May 1633, Maclellan’s prominence was cemented when he was granted the title of Lord Kirkcudbright by Charles I.

In the 1630s, MacLellan’s activities in Ireland took a more bureaucratic turn as he sought to enforce the maintenance of public infrastructure and force local landowners to fulfill their obligations. His efforts to recover money owed to him were often met with resistance, and his involvement in these matters continued into the early 1630s. His final years were spent negotiating with the Crown and local landowners, and by 1632, he had successfully brought a significant sum into the Treasury. 

Sir Robert MacLellan of Bombie’s later years were marked by his persistent legal and financial troubles, but also by substantial contributions to the plantation efforts in Ireland and his role as a landowner. He died 18 January 1639.

<doc id="869174" wikidata="Q275061" url="?curid=869174" title="Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester">
<text>Catherine Colyear, &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Dorchester and Countess of Portmore (&quot;née&quot; Sedley; 21 December 1657 – 26 October 1717), was an English noble and courtier. She was the mistress of King James II of England both before and after he came to the throne. Catherine was noted not for beauty but for her celebrated wittiness and sharp tongue.

==Early life==
Catherine was the only legitimate child of the restoration poet Sir Charles Sedley, 5th Bt. Her mother was Lady Catherine Savage, daughter of John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers. She grew up &quot;notoriously plain&quot; (being brunette and thin rather than plump and fair). While her father roistered around the country, her mother spiralled into insanity until she entered a psychiatric hospital in Ghent during Catherine&#x27;s early teens. At this low point in her life, Sir Charles introduced a common-law wife, Anne Ayscough, into the family and ejected his daughter from the house.

==Royal mistress==

She worked for Mary of Modena, who had just married James, Duke of York, heir presumptive to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This eventually led to an affair with him. She was bewildered at having been chosen by James. &quot;It cannot be my beauty for he must see I have none,&quot; she remarked incredulously. &quot;And it cannot be my wit, for he has not enough to know that I have any.&quot; James in fact was often attracted to women like Catherine and Arabella Churchill who were generally considered plain, if not ugly; his brother King Charles II once joked that his confessor must impose these mistresses on him as a penance.

After his accession, James yielded to pressure from his confessor Fr. Bonaventure Giffard, backed by the 2nd Earl of Sunderland and several Catholic councillors, and put her away for a time. While James by his own account took Giffard&#x27;s intervention &quot;very kindly, he being a truly religious man&quot; he told his councillors sharply &quot;not to meddle in things that in no way related to them&quot;, adding, with a rare touch of humour, that he had not realised that they had all entered the priesthood too.

She was created Countess of Dorchester for life in 1686, an elevation which aroused much indignation and compelled Catherine to reside for a time in Ireland. In 1696 she married Sir David Colyear, 2nd Bt, who was created Earl of Portmore in 1703, and she was thus the mother of Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore. After the Glorious Revolution when Queen Mary II refused to receive her at court, Catherine inquired how Mary, who had broken the commandment to honour her father, was in any way better than Catherine, who had broken the commandment against adultery.

At the court of George I she met Charles II&#x27;s mistress Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, and William III&#x27;s mistress Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Orkney, and exclaimed &quot;God! Who would have thought that we three whores should meet here.&quot; At George&#x27;s coronation in 1714 when the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison, ritually asked if the people accepted their new king, Catherine, observing the number of soldiers on duty, asked caustically &quot;Does the old fool think that anyone will say No?&quot;

She died in Bath on 26 October 1717.

By James II, Lady Dorchester had a daughter, Lady Catherine Darnley (died 1743), who married James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey, and after his death married John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. Through Catherine Darnley she was the ancestress of the Barons Mulgrave and of the Mitford sisters. Through her son, Charles, Lord Portmore, she was the grandmother of Elizabeth Collier, wife of Dr Erasmus Darwin, the physician, scientist, poet and grandfather of Charles Darwin.

<doc id="869177" wikidata="Q5724318" url="?curid=869177" title="Henry Killigrew (playwright)">
<text>Henry Killigrew (11 February 1613 – 14 March 1700) was an English clergyman and playwright. He became a chaplain to Charles I, and chaplain and almoner to James, Duke of York (the future James II). Following the Restoration, he became Master of the Savoy.

==Life==
Killigrew was born in Hanworth on 11 February 1613, the fifth and youngest son of Robert Killigrew and his wife Mary Woodhouse. He was the brother of the dramatist Thomas Killigrew and of Elizabeth Killigrew, Viscountess Shannon, mistress of the future Charles II.

He was educated at Cripplegate, London and at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating B.A. 1632, M.A. 1638, D.D. 1642.

He served as a chaplain in Charles I&#x27;s army during the English Civil War and was chaplain to James, Duke of York (the future James II) during his time in exile. He was also appointed almoner to James, Duke of York.
He served as a canon of Westminster Abbey in 1642 and from 1660 to his death and as rector of Wheathampstead.

In 1663, Henry Killigrew was appointed Master of the Savoy. According to some writers the final ruin of the Savoy Hospital was due to Killigrew&#x27;s &quot;improvidence, greed, and other bad qualities&quot;. A bill was passed in 1697 abolishing its privileges of sanctuary. The hospital was leased out in tenements, and the master appropriated the profits; among the leases granted was one (1699) to Henry Killigrew, the patentee of Drury Lane Theatre, for his lodgings in the Savoy, at a rent of 1 shilling per year for forty years. A commission appointed by William III reported that the relief of the poor (the hospital&#x27;s intended purpose) was being utterly neglected. In 1702, shortly after Killigrew&#x27;s death, the hospital was dissolved.

A juvenile play of his, &quot;The Conspiracy&quot;, was printed surreptitiously in 1638, and in an authenticated version in 1653 as &quot;Pallantus and Eudora&quot;.

===Family===
He married Judith and had four children:

* Henry Killigrew (died 1712), an admiral
* James Killigrew, also a naval officer, who was killed in an encounter with the French in January 1695 during the Nine Years&#x27; War
* Anne Killigrew (1660-1685), poet and painter, who was maid of honour to the Duchess of York, and was the subject of an ode by Dryden, which Samuel Johnson thought the noblest in the language
* Elizabeth Killigrew (died 1701) married her father&#x27;s curate at Wheathampstead, John Lambe, and produced 10 children

<text>Quatermass 2 (retitled Enemy From Space in the United States and Canada) is a 1957 black-and-white British science fiction horror film drama from Hammer Film Productions. It was originally released in the UK as &quot;Quatermass II&quot; and was produced by Anthony Hinds, directed by Val Guest, and stars Brian Donlevy with co-stars John Longden, Sidney James, Bryan Forbes, Vera Day, and William Franklyn. &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; is a sequel to Hammer&#x27;s earlier film &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; (1955). Like its predecessor, it is based on the BBC Television serial &quot;Quatermass II&quot; written by Nigel Kneale. Brian Donlevy reprises his role as the eponymous Professor Bernard Quatermass, making him the only actor to play the character twice in a film. It is often erroneously considered as the first film sequel to use the &#x27;2&#x27; / &#x27;II&#x27; suffix within the title, though this distinction belongs to Sanshiro Sugata Part II.

The film&#x27;s story concerns Quatermass&#x27;s investigation of reports of hundreds of meteorites landing only in the Winnerden Flats area of the UK. His inquiries lead him to a huge industrial complex, strikingly similar to his own plans for a Moon colony. This top-secret facility is in fact the centre of a conspiracy involving the alien infiltration of the highest echelons of the British Government. Quatermass and his allies must now do whatever is necessary to defeat the alien threat before it is too late.

==Plot==
As Professor Bernard Quatermass struggles to gain government support for his Moon colonisation project, his interest becomes focused on reports of hundreds of meteorites landing in an area known as Winnerden Flats. Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague, Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite shaped like a small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Uniform-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with submachine guns and sporting similar V-shaped marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and forcing him to leave the area.

Trying to discover what happened to Marsh, Quatermass contacts Inspector Lomax, who had previously assisted him in &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;. Lomax puts him in touch with Vincent Broadhead, a member of parliament, who has been trying to uncover the veil of secrecy surrounding Winnerden Flats and the organisation and deliverance of massive quantities of material supplies and manpower without any real explanation as to what it is for. Quatermass joins Broadhead on an official tour of the complex, which he is told has been built to manufacture synthetic food. Slipping away from the visiting party, Broadhead gets inside one of the huge domes dominating the skyline. Quatermass later finds him dying, covered in a corrosive black slime, warning him about what he discovered inside the dome.

Shot at by guards as he escapes, Quatermass rushes to Inspector Lomax, explaining that he believes that the complex is indeed making food, but not for human consumption. Its purpose is to provide a suitable living environment for small alien creatures being housed inside the huge domes. Lomax attempts to alert his superiors, but when he meets the commissioner of police, he notices that he, too, is sporting the V-shaped mark; the aliens have taken control of key people in the government.

Quatermass and Lomax then turn to journalist Jimmy Hall, who is sceptical of their story, but asks to visit Winnerden Flats. At the local community centre, they receive a hostile reception from locals employed to do heavy construction and other work at the complex but not told anything more than they need to know. The mood changes, however, when one of the meteorites crashes through the building roof and opens, injuring and infecting barmaid Sheila. Armed guards from the plant arrive and shoot Hall dead as he telephones his story into his newspaper. A melee ensues, after which the villagers form a mob that marches on the complex. Rushing the gates, Quatermass, Lomax, and the villagers barricade themselves inside the pressure control room.

Realising that Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is poisonous to the aliens, Quatermass sabotages their life support system, pumping only pure oxygen into their large domes, suffocating them. Simultaneously, Quatermass&#x27;s assistant, Brand at the rocket complex, is gunned down by invading Winnerden Flats guards but is able to launch an atomic rocket toward the near-Earth asteroid believed to be the alien&#x27;s staging point. The individual aliens combine their small bodies, creating 150-foot tall masses that soon burst from their three domes. The rocket destroys the asteroid with a nuclear explosion. Their space base destroyed and now being fully exposed to Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the giant masses of combined creatures collapse and die. The V-shaped marks disappear from the affected humans, leaving them with no memory of having been under alien control. As they head back to the village, Lomax wonders aloud how he&#x27;ll make a believable report about all that&#x27;s happened, while more pointedly, Quatermass questions just how &quot;final&quot; will that report be...

==Production==
The first &quot;Quatermass&quot; film had been a major success for Hammer and, eager for a sequel, they purchased the rights to Nigel Kneale&#x27;s follow-up before the BBC had even begun transmission of the new serial. For this adaptation, Nigel Kneale himself was allowed to write the first draft of the screenplay, although subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest. The plot is a condensed but largely faithful retelling of the original television serial. The main difference between the two versions is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass blasts off in a rocket to confront the aliens in outer space, whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, to destroy the aliens&#x27; asteroid base. Returning director Val Guest once again employed many cinema vérité techniques to present the fantastic elements of the plot with the greatest degree of realism. Nigel Kneale was critical of the final film, mainly on account of the return of Brian Donlevy in the lead role. Kneale was unhappy with Donlevy&#x27;s interpretation of the character and also claimed the actor&#x27;s performance was marred by his alcoholism, a claim denied by Val Guest.

Although &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; was financially successful, its box office performance was eclipsed by the massive success of another Hammer film, &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot;, which was to be the first of their many Gothic horror films. As a result, it would be ten years before Hammer adapted the next &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial for the cinema with &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1967). &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; was, however, the first film for which Hammer pre-sold the distribution rights in the United States, a financial model that would quickly become the norm for subsequent Hammer productions.

===Origins===
===Writing===
Nigel Kneale had been unhappy with Hammer&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, partly because he received no extra remuneration from the sale of the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of &quot;Quatermass II&quot;. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Director Val Guest worked on subsequent drafts, as he had done before on &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;. Guest recalled of Kneale&#x27;s script that there was &quot;lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it&quot;. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented: &quot;There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds&quot;. The BBFC&#x27;s main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.

As with &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, the screenplay for &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; condenses many of the events of the original television version. The most significant change is at the climax: Quatermass and his assistant, Pugh, use Quatermass&#x27;s rocket to travel to the asteroid to take on the aliens on their home ground, whereas in the theatrical film the rocket is fired, unmanned, at the asteroid to destroy it. Several characters from the television version do not appear in the film, most notably Quatermass&#x27;s daughter, Paula, and his assistant, Leo Pugh (their roles are partially replaced by new character Brand). Conversely, the characters of Inspector Lomax and Quatermass&#x27;s young assistant Marsh reappear in the film version, having previously been in &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, but not in the television version. The character of Sheila the barmaid also appears only in the film version.

===Casting===
* Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised his role as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his interpretation of the role in &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;. As had been the case on &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, Donlevy&#x27;s alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: &quot;He [Donlevy] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, &quot;What&#x27;s this movie called?&quot; and they said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s called &quot;Quatermass 2&quot;&quot;. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to say all that? There&#x27;s too much talk. Cut down some of the talk&quot;. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was&quot;. Val Guest has denied Kneale&#x27;s claims: &quot;So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It&#x27;s absolute &quot;balls&quot;, because he was &quot;not&quot; paralytic. He wasn&#x27;t &quot;stone cold sober&quot; either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines&quot;. Guest also recalled: &quot;By after lunch he would come to me and say &quot;Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?&quot; We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with&quot;.
* John Longden as Inspector Lomax: The role of Lomax had originally been played by Jack Warner in &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;. When Warner proved unavailable for the sequel, the role was recast and the part given to John Longden. Longden had been a major star of British silent films and had also appeared in several early Alfred Hitchcock films including &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929), &quot;Elstree Calling&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Skin Game&quot; (1931). Nigel Kneale greatly preferred Longden&#x27;s authoritative take on the character to Jack Warner&#x27;s more comedic &quot;breezy sergeant&quot; in the first film.
* Sid James (credited as Sydney James in the film and Sidney James on its poster) as Jimmy Hall: At the time, James was known as a character actor, specialising mainly in &quot;tough guy&quot; roles, with credits in films such as &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; (uncredited, 1948), &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951), and &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957). James plays the character of Jimmy Hall in a much more comedic manner than Roger Delgado&#x27;s interpretation of the equivalent journalist character Hugh Conrad in the television version; Guest cast James in order to &quot;lighten the story a bit&quot;. He later went on to enjoy widespread fame in many comedy roles including &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; (1956–60), the &quot;Carry On&quot; series of films, and sitcoms such as &quot;George and the Dragon&quot; (1966), &quot;Two in Clover&quot; (1969–70) and &quot;Bless This House&quot; (1971–76).
* Bryan Forbes as Marsh: Forbes had appeared in a number of supporting roles in films, including &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; (1949), &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; (1955). However, he later became better known as a director, with films such as &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (1961), &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (1975) among his best-known credits. Forbes later recalled of the film: &quot;I was one of the people attacked by the alien pods. This pod exploded and I ended up with what was supposed to be a terrible alien growth on my face. Come lunchtime and we all went off to the pub. Of course, I couldn&#x27;t take this stuff off, the makeup was too complex; the landlord refused to serve me&quot;.
* William Franklyn as Brand: Franklyn later became well known for his voiceovers for a series of advertisements for Schweppes tonic water. In 2004 he took over from the late Peter Jones as the Voice of the Book in the radio version of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. He died in 2006.
* Vera Day as Sheila: Vera Day was first spotted by Val Guest in the musical &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; at the London Hippodrome.

Other actors appearing in the film include Charles Lloyd-Pack, Tom Chatto, John Van Eyssen, Percy Herbert, and Michael Ripper.

===Filming===
Val Guest, who had directed &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, returned for &quot;Quatermass 2&quot;. Guest once again sought to create a film that felt as real as possible, using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film&#x27;s climactic scenes. Guest planned each day&#x27;s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots he wanted to make that day.

Filming took place between 28 May and 13 July 1956. The film&#x27;s budget, at £92,000, was much larger than that of &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;. The bigger budget was achieved by the advance sale of the distribution rights in the United States to United Artists. United Artists contributed some £64,000 towards the production of the film, as well as Brian Donlevy&#x27;s $25,000 fee and his airfare to London from the US. Although filming still occurred at Bray Studios in Berkshire, the larger budget allowed for greater use of location filming in the making of the film than had been possible for its predecessor. The key location used was the oil refinery at Shell Haven in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, on the Thames Estuary, which represented the secret Winnerden Flats complex. This was also where location scenes in the BBC television production of the story were filmed. Despite its size, the plant was run by a relatively small number of personnel, simplifying Guest&#x27;s job of making it appear eerily deserted. Guest was also surprised at how relaxed the plant&#x27;s management were about allowing him to stage the climactic gun battle at such a potentially flammable location. Focus puller Harry Oakes recalled, however, that a Newman-Sinclair clockwork camera had to be used for some scenes because of the danger posed by sparks from electrical equipment. The scenes of Vincent Broadhead emerging from one of the domes covered in the noxious black slime were particularly difficult to realise, necessitating many retakes. Tom Chatto, playing Broadhead, whose wife was a leading casting director, joked after the scene was finally completed, &quot;Remind me to talk to my wife about casting me in this&quot;. The Shell Haven location was further enhanced by the use of matte paintings created by special effects designer Les Bowie to add the giant domes within which the aliens were incubated.

Other locations used included the real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction at the time and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead. The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy&#x27;s toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after it. As well as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson&#x27;s first film for Hammer; he went on to become its regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.

==Reception==
&quot;Quatermass 2&quot; received its first public screening at a trade show on 22 March 1957; its official première was held two months later at the London Pavilion on 24 May. It went on general release, with supporting feature &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;, on 17 June. The film received an &#x27;X&#x27; Certificate from the BBFC. It was released in the US under the title &quot;Enemy From Space&quot;.

&quot;Quatermass 2&quot; received mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found the film &quot;all good grisly fun, if this is the sort of thing you enjoy&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; remarked that &quot;the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally&quot;. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London &quot;Evening News&quot; wrote: &quot;Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. &quot;Quatermass II&quot; fails on all these scores, I am afraid&quot;. Similarly, the reviewer in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; felt: &quot;The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: &quot;How am I going to make a report on all this?&quot; I felt the same way&quot;.

==Legacy==
Although commercially successful, &quot;Quatermass 2&quot;s release was largely overshadowed by the box-office record-breaking performance of Hammer&#x27;s &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot;, which was also released in May 1957. Upon this success, Hammer made its priority the production of Gothic horror films. For this reason, although Nigel Kneale had written a new Quatermass serial for the BBC, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (broadcast December 1958 to January 1959), Hammer did not acquire the rights until 1961 and the film version did not appear until 1967. &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; is notable, however, for being the first film Hammer pre-sold to a major US distributor, in this case United Artists. This new finance and distribution deal would become the norm for subsequent Hammer films and led to them eventually winding down their own distribution arm, Exclusive Films, in the mid-1960s.

Critical opinion of &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; in the years since its release remains divided. Writing in &quot;Science Fiction in the Cinema&quot;, John Baxter found the film &quot;a faithful but ponderous adaptation of Kneale&#x27;s TV sequel. There are effective sequences, director Guest and cameraman Gerald Gibbs shooting with light lancing up through the shadows in a manner reminiscent of Jacques Tourneur&#x27;s &quot;Night (or Curse) of the Demon&quot;. Otherwise the film is indifferent&quot;. Similarly, John Brosnan, in his book &quot;The Primal Screen&quot;, wrote that &quot;&quot;Quatermass 2&quot; isn&#x27;t as good as the first one, despite a bigger budget. Again the theme is possession (all four &quot;Quatermass&quot; stories are variations on the same theme) with Kneale again cleverly mixing sf with the supernatural. The alien invasion may be sf but it is presented with the trappings of traditional horror, such as the V-shaped &quot;mark of the devil&quot; that all possessed people display&quot;. On the other hand, Bill Warren, in &quot;Keep Watching The Skies!&quot;, found &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; to be &quot;one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s. It is not notably better than [&quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;], but the story idea is more involving, the production is livelier and there are more events in the unfolding of the story&quot;. Kim Newman in 1986 praised the film as &quot;extraordinary&quot; and, comparing it to &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956), Newman notes that while Don Siegel&#x27;s film is &quot;a general allegory&quot; about dehumanisation and conformity, &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; is &quot;a specific attack on the Conservative Government of the time, down to the inclusion of several characters obviously based on real political figures&quot;.

&quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;″s Mark Gatiss mentions on the DVD commentary for the First Series that a scene where two workmen, who have been abducted by Tubs and Edward, escape, covered in tar, was inspired by the scene in which the Vincent Broadhead character is covered in &quot;synthetic food&quot; from one of the huge outdoor storage domes.

==Home media==
&quot;Quatermass 2&quot; was released on Region 2 DVD in 2003 by DD Video. It contained a number of extra features including commentary by director Val Guest and writer Nigel Kneale, as well as an interview with Val Guest and a trailer for &quot;Enemy From Space&quot;, as the film is known in the US. The film was first released in the US on All Region NTSC DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment and is mastered from an archival print that shows every image with razor-sharp clarity and richness; it contains the same extra features as on the Region 2 UK release. The film had been previously released on both VHS cassette and LaserDisc.

==In other media==
The film was adapted into a 15-page comics story for the August 1978 issue of the magazine &quot;Hammer&#x27;s Halls of Horror&quot; (volume 2, #23, published by Top Sellers Ltd). It was drawn by David Lloyd from a script by Steve Parkhouse. The story was titled &quot;Enemy from Space (Quatermass II).&quot;

<text>Matthew Barney (born March 25, 1967) is an American contemporary artist and film director who works in the fields of sculpture, film, photography and drawing. His works explore connections among geography, biology, geology and mythology as well as notable themes of sex, intercourse, and conflict. His early pieces were sculptural installations combined with performance and video. Between 1994 and 2002, he created &quot;The Cremaster Cycle&quot;, a series of five films described by Jonathan Jones in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;one of the most imaginative and brilliant achievements in the history of avant-garde cinema.&quot; He is also known for his projects &quot;Drawing Restraint 9&quot; (2005), &quot;River of Fundament&quot; (2014) and &quot;Redoubt&quot; (2018).

==Life and career==
Matthew Barney was born March 25, 1967, as the younger of two children in San Francisco, California, where he lived until he was 7. He lived in Boise, Idaho from 1973 to 1985, where his father got a job administering a catering service at Boise State University and where he attended elementary, middle, and high school. His parents divorced and his mother, an abstract painter, moved to New York City, where he would frequently visit. It was there where he was first introduced to the art scene.

Barney was recruited by Yale University in 1985 to play football and planned to go into pre-med, but he also intended to study art. In 1989, he graduated from Yale. His earliest works, created at Yale, were staged at the university&#x27;s Payne Whitney Gymnasium. In the 1990s, Barney moved to New York, where he worked as a catalog model, a career that helped him finance his early work as an artist. In 2002, Barney had a daughter with his then partner, the singer Björk, with whom he lived in a penthouse co-op in Brooklyn Heights. By September 2013, Barney and Björk were no longer a couple; Björk chronicled the breakup in her 2015 album &quot;Vulnicura&quot;.

, Barney maintained a studio in Long Island City, Queens.

Matthew Barney is represented by Gladstone Gallery.

==Works==

===&quot;Drawing Restraint&quot; (1987–present)===
The &quot;Drawing Restraint&quot; series began in 1987 as a series of studio experiments, drawing upon an athletic model of development in which growth occurs only through restraint: the muscle encounters resistance, becomes engorged and is broken down, and in healing becomes stronger. In literally restraining the body while attempting to make a drawing, &quot;Drawing Restraint 1–6&quot; (1987–89) were documentations made using video and photography. &quot;Drawing Restraint 7&quot; marks the influx of narrative and characterization, resulting in a three channel video and a series of drawings and photographs, for which Barney was awarded the Aperto Prize in the 1993 Venice Biennale.

A series of ten vitrines containing drawings, &quot;Drawing Restraint 8&quot; was included in the 2003 Venice Biennale and prefigured the narrative development for &quot;Drawing Restraint 9&quot; (2005). A major project consisting of a feature-length film and soundtrack composed by Björk, large-scale sculptures, photographs and drawings, &quot;Drawing Restraint 9&quot; was built upon themes such as the Shinto religion, the tea ceremony, the history of whaling, and the supplantation of blubber with refined petroleum for oil. A full-scale survey of Barney&#x27;s work through &quot;Drawing Restraint 9&quot; was held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2006 and included over 150 objects of varying media. &quot;Drawing Restraint 10 – 16&quot; (2005–07) are site-specific performances that recall the earlier Yale pieces.

&quot;Drawing Restraint 17&quot; and &quot;18&quot; were performed at the Schaulager in Basel in 2010 in conjunction with the exhibition &quot;Prayer Sheet with the Wound and the Nail,&quot; a survey of the &quot;Drawing Restraint&quot; series through &quot;Drawing Restraint 18&quot;.

&quot;Drawing Restraint 19&quot; employs a skateboard as a drawing tool. A block of graphite is mounted beneath the skateboard deck on the front end of the board. A skater performs a nose manual (a wheelie on the nose of the board, leaning in the direction of movement) across a smooth surface, tipping the nose of the board forward and leaving behind a drawn graphite line. The piece was part of a benefit art show and auction titled &quot;Good Wood&quot;, raising awareness and funds for Power House Productions&#x27; &quot;Ride It Sculpture Park&quot; in Detroit, Michigan. The riding was performed on site by skateboarder Lance Mountain, documented by photographer Joe Brook and published by Juxtapoz Magazine in their February 2013 issue. The board was purchased by People Skate and Snowboard and it is displayed at their only location in Keego Harbor, Michigan.

===&quot;The Cremaster Cycle&quot; (1994–2002)===

Matthew Barney&#x27;s epic &quot;Cremaster&quot; cycle (1994–2002) is a self-enclosed aesthetic system consisting of five feature-length films that explore processes of creation. The cycle unfolds not just cinematically, but also through the photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produces in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, which controls testicular contractions in response to external stimuli. Barney&#x27;s long-time collaborator Jonathan Bepler composed and arranged the films’ soundtracks.

The project is rife with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: &quot;Cremaster 1&quot; represents the most &quot;ascended&quot; or undifferentiated state, &quot;Cremaster 5&quot; the most &quot;descended&quot; or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknown. In Barney&#x27;s metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality. As the cycle evolved over eight years, Barney looked beyond biology as a way to explore the creation of form, employing narrative models from other realms, such as biography, mythology, and geology. The photographs, drawings, and sculptures radiate outward from the narrative core of each film installment. Barney&#x27;s photographs—framed in plastic and often arranged in diptychs and triptychs that distill moments from the plot—often emulate classical portraiture. His graphite and petroleum jelly drawings represent key aspects of the project&#x27;s conceptual framework.

===&quot;River of Fundament&quot; (2006–2014)===

&quot;River of Fundament&quot; takes the form of a three-act opera and is loosely based on Norman Mailer’s novel &quot;Ancient Evenings&quot;. In collaboration with composer Jonathan Bepler, Barney combines traditional modes of narrative cinema with filmed elements of performance, sculpture, and opera, reconstructing Mailer’s hypersexual story of Egyptian gods and the seven stages of reincarnation, alongside the rise and fall of the American car industry.

Barney replaced the human body with the body of the 1967 Chrysler Imperial that was the central motif from his earlier film &quot;Cremaster 3&quot;. The film’s central scene is an abstraction of Mailer’s wake, set in a replica of the late author’s apartment in Brooklyn Heights and featuring Maggie Gyllenhaal, Paul Giamatti, Elaine Stritch, Ellen Burstyn, Peter Donald Badalamenti II, Joan La Barbara, and jazz percussionist Milford Graves.

===&quot;Redoubt&quot; (2018–2021)===
Barney began producing a new two-hour film, &quot;Redoubt&quot;, in 2017, which premiered in March 2019. It is set in the Sawtooth Range of Idaho, United States, and uses multiple layers of myths, including the myth of Diana and Actaeon, as well as references to the controversial reintroduction of wolves into the Sawtooth Mountains and metallurgy, to discuss &quot;humanity&#x27;s place in the natural world&quot;. The Yale University Art Gallery debuted &quot;Redoubt&quot; on March 1, 2019, alongside an exhibition of large bronze and brass sculptures and electroplated engravings inspired by the film. The show traveled afterward to UCCA Beijing (2019-2020), then Hayward Gallery in London (2020- 2021).

=== Performance ===
Barney has explored live performance before an audience. The pieces &quot;REN&quot; and &quot;Guardian of the Veil&quot; revisit the language of the &quot;Cremaster Cycle&quot;, via a ritualistic exploration of Egyptian symbolism inspired by Norman Mailer&#x27;s novel &quot;Ancient Evenings&quot;. &quot;Guardian of the Veil&quot; took place on July 12, 2007, at the Manchester International Festival in England. &quot;REN&quot; took place on May 18, 2008, in Los Angeles. His October 2, 2010 performance, &quot;KHU&quot;, the second part in his seven-part performance series in collaboration with Jonathan Bepler inspired by &quot;Ancient Evenings,&quot; took place in Detroit.

In June 2009, a collaboration between Barney and Elizabeth Peyton, titled &quot;Blood of Two&quot;, was performed for the opening of the Deste Foundation&#x27;s exhibition space, the Slaughterhouse, located on the Greek island Hydra. The two-hour performance involved divers retrieving from a nearby cove a vitrine containing drawings which had been submerged for months. A funeral-like procession of fishermen carried the case up a winding set of stairs. At one point, a dead shark was laid on the case, and the fishermen proceeded to the gallery space, carrying the case and shark, accompanied by the onlookers and a herd of goats. At the Slaughterhouse, the case was opened, water poured out, and the drawings revealed. The shark was eventually cooked and fed to the guests.

=== Public projects ===
In June 2017, Barney, local art curator Brandon Stosuy, and other artists installed &quot;Remains Board&quot; on his studio in Long Island City. The board is a large seven-segment digital clock, visible from the United Nations and midtown Manhattan, counting down the days, hours, and minutes remaining in the U.S. president Donald Trump&#x27;s first term. The &quot;Remains Board&quot; was initially illuminated during a durational performance of physical comedy by Josh Fadem. On inauguration day in 2021, at 12:00 p.m., Haela Hunt-Hendrix of Liturgy performed a guitar solo beneath the &quot;Remains Board&quot; as the clock began to approach 00:00:00.

==Exhibitions==
Following his inclusion in two group shows at Althea Viafora gallery in New York in 1990, Barney&#x27;s solo debut in 1991 at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery was hailed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;an extraordinary first show&quot;. That same year, at the age of twenty-four, he had a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, organized a solo exhibition of his work that toured Europe throughout 1995 and 1996. Barney was subsequently included in many international exhibitions, such as documenta 9 in Kassel (1992); the 1993 and 1995 Biennial exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Aperto ’93 at the 48th Venice Biennale, for which he was awarded the Europa 2000 Prize. For the season 2000/2001 in the Vienna State Opera, Barney designed a large scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series &quot;Safety Curtain&quot;, conceived by museum in progress.

&quot;Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle&quot;, an exhibition of artwork from the entire cycle organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, premiered at the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, in June 2002 and subsequently traveled to the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. A large-scale exhibition of the entire “Drawing Restraint” series was organized by the 21st Century Museum for Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, in 2005 and traveled to Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Serpentine Gallery, London; and Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna. Barney has also had major solo exhibitions organized by Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo (2003), Living Art Museum in Reykjavik (2003), Sammlung Goetz in Munich (2007), and Fondazione Merz in Turin (2008). His work has been included in major group exhibitions including &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; at Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and Guggenheim Bilbao (2002), Venice Biennale (2003), &quot;Quartet: Barney, Gober, Levine, Walker&quot; at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis (2005), Biennial of Moving Images at Centre pour l’Image Contemporaine in Paris (2005), and &quot;All in the Present Must Be Transformed: Matthew Barney and Joseph Beuys&quot; at Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin (2006).

In 2013, the Morgan Library &amp; Museum mounted “Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney”, the first museum retrospective devoted to the artist&#x27;s drawings, later traveling to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris. In 2014, Barney exhibited &quot;River of Fundament&quot; at Haus der Kunst, Munich. The exhibition later traveled to the Museum of Old and New Art, Hobart, Tasmania and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. &quot;River of Fundament&quot; was considered the largest filmic project since the Cremaster Cycle and first major museum solo exhibition in Los Angeles. In 2019, the Yale University Art Gallery exhibited &quot;Matthew Barney: Redoubt,&quot; the first solo museum exhibition in the U.S. since the presentation of &quot;River of Fundament&quot; at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 2015–16.

== Critical analysis ==
Barney&#x27;s work has provoked strong critical reaction, both positive and negative. Barney&#x27;s work has been compared to performance artists Chris Burden and Vito Acconci, and some critics have argued that Barney&#x27;s art is simultaneously a critique and a celebration of commercialism and blockbuster filmmaking. Commenting on the &quot;Cremaster&quot; series&#x27; enigmatic nature, Alexandra Keller and Frazer Ward write:

The philosopher Arthur C. Danto, well known for his work on aesthetics, has praised Barney&#x27;s work, noting the importance of Barney&#x27;s use of sign systems such as Masonic symbology.

Others have asserted Barney&#x27;s works are contemporary expressions of surrealism. In the words of Chris Chang, Barney&#x27;s &quot;Cremaster&quot; films, though &quot;completely arcane, hermetic and solipsistic ... nevertheless periodically provide some of the most enigmatically beautiful experimental film imagery you&#x27;ll ever see.&quot;

&quot;Is Barney&#x27;s work a new beginning for a new century?&quot;, asks Richard Lacayo, writing in &quot;Time&quot;. &quot;It feels more like a very energetic longing for a beginning, in which all kinds of imagery have been put to the service of one man&#x27;s intricate fantasy of return to the womb. Something lovely and exasperating is forever in formation there. Will he ever give birth?&quot;

&quot;Barney is the real thing. When he brings his boundless imagination to a subject he goes down to its depths to create images and implant ideas that stay in your mind for ever&quot; writes art historian Richard Dorment in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

Kanye West also admires Barney&#x27;s work and credited him as an influence on the music video for West&#x27;s song &quot;Famous&quot;.

<doc id="869187" wikidata="Q714559" url="?curid=869187" title="Kasuga-taisha">
<text>is a Shinto shrine in Nara, Nara Prefecture, Japan. It is the shrine of the Fujiwara family, established in 768 CE and rebuilt several times over the centuries. The interior is famous for its many bronze lanterns, as well as the many stone lanterns that lead up to the shrine.

The architectural style &quot;Kasuga-zukuri&quot; takes its name from Kasuga Shrine&#x27;s &quot;honden&quot; (sanctuary). The Torii at Kasuga-taisha is one of the oldest in Shinto and helped influence the style of Torii seen across much of Japan. Kasuga Shrine, and the Kasugayama Primeval Forest near it, are registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara&quot;.

The path to Kasuga Shrine passes through a deer park. In the park, deer are able to roam freely and are believed to be sacred messengers of the Shinto gods that inhabit the shrine and surrounding mountainous terrain. Kasuga Shrine and the deer have been featured in several paintings and works of art of the Nambokucho Period. Over three thousand stone lanterns line the way. The Man&#x27;yo Botanical Garden is adjacent to the shrine.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The birth of this shrine, according to legend, began when the first kami of Kasuga-taisha, Takemikazuchi, rode on the back of a white deer to the top of Mount Mikasa in 768 CE. This kami is said to have traveled from the Kashima Jingu Shrine in order to protect Nara. The shrine location first received favor from the Imperial government in the Heian period as a result of the power from the Fujiwara family as well as Empress Shōtoku.

From 1871 through 1946, Kasuga Shrine was officially designated one of the &quot;Kanpei-taisha&quot; (官幣大社), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.

The four main kami enshrined here are Ame no koyane, Himegami, Futsunushi no mikoto, and Takemikazuchi no mikoto. Though these are the primary divine beings of Kasuga taisha, they are often grouped together as a syncretic, combined deity known as Kasuga Daimyōjin. Kasuga Daimyōjin is composed of five divine beings and each consists of a Buddhist deity and Shinto kami counterpart. The fifth deity, , was added much later and is said to be the divine child of Ame no koyane and Himegami. The importance of the multifaceted kami was that it became a template for future worshipers who wanted to combine several deities to pray to at once.

== Architecture ==
The architectural style of Kasuga-taisha comes from the name of its main hall (&quot;honden&quot;) known as &quot;Kasuga-zukuri.&quot; The shrine complex is protected by four cloisters and contains a main sanctuary, treasure house, several different halls, and large gates. One beautiful aspect of this shrine is the many wisteria trees known as &quot;Sunazuri-no-Fuji&quot; that bloom in late April and early May. This shrine is also home to over 3,000 lanterns which are made of either stone or bronze. An entire hall is devoted to them which is &quot;Fujinami-no-ya&quot; Hall but the lanterns are only lit during the Setsubun Mantoro and Chugen Mantoro festivals.

The four main kami each have a shrine devoted to them which are all in the same architectural style. They are characterized by sloping gabled roofs, a rectangular structure, katsuogi (decorative logs), and chigi (forked roof structures). The first hall established is dedicated to Takemikazuchi no mikoto, the second to Futsunushi no mikoto, the third to Amenokoyane no mikoto, and the final hall is attributed to the consort, Himegami. Several auxiliary shrines lie outside the main sanctuary that are dedicated to lesser kami. One is allotted to Tsunofuri no kami, that is commonly known as Tsubakimoto Jinja Shrine or Kayabusa Myojin. Kasenomiya Jinja Shrine is attributed to Shinatsuhiko no mikoto and Shinatsuhime who are kami of the winds. Wakamiya Jinja Shrine, created in 1135 CE, is one of the more prominent auxiliary shrines because it houses the &quot;kogami,&quot; or offspring kami called Ame no Oshikumono no mikoto. The primary worship here revolves around vengeful gods, and the dead and is the location of the Kasuga Wakamiya festival.

The Treasure House at this shrine contains hundreds national treasures as well as about many other cultural properties, most of which are from the Heian period. Some of the most noteworthy items that reside here are ornate taiko drums used in gagaku from the Kamakura period, arrows with crystal whistles from the Heian period, and bronze mirrors of the Heian and Nanboku-cho periods.

Kasuga-taisha, like Ise Grand Shrine and Izumo-taisha, continues the tradition of &quot;shikinen zōtai&quot; (式年造替), the regular rebuilding of shrines. This is a tradition based on the &quot;tokowaka&quot; (常若) concept of Shinto, in which objects are renewed in order to keep their divine prestige in pursuit of eternity. Like the Ise Grand Shrine, Kasuga-taisha has been rebuilding its shrines to the same specifications every 20 years for more than 1000 years since the Nara period, with the most recent reconstruction being the 60th rebuilding in 2016.

==Festivals==
During the festivals of &quot;Setsubun Mantoro&quot; (February 3) and &quot;Chugen Mantoro&quot; (August 14–15), three thousand shrine lanterns are all lit at once. The Setsubun Mantoro refers to the celebration of the seasonal shift from winter to spring while the Chugen Mantoro relates to the transition of summer to fall. They both take place in order to celebrate the Obon and Setsubun holidays in Japanese culture. At Kasuga Grand shrine, people are seen writing and attaching their wishes, or &quot;ema&quot;, to the lanterns before lighting them during both festivals. Additionally, it is said that tossing dried beans at these times will ward off bad luck in the future.

March 13 is the &quot;Kasuga Matsuri,&quot; a local festival which features the dances of gagaku and bugaku. Shinto women perform traditional Japanese Yamato-mai dances that date back to the Heian and Nara periods. This festival also holds a horse celebration which consists of a parade through the streets by a &quot;sacred&quot; horse. One will see people dressed in traditional costumes of the Heian to Edo periods and can experience authentic &quot;kagura&quot; dance displays with &quot;dengaku&quot; music.

The Kasuga Wakamiya Festival takes place at the Wakamiya Jinja shrine from December 15 to 18th each year. The main goal of this gathering was to ward off disease while promoting new growth for the spring. Like &quot;Kasuga Matsuri&quot;, attendants can see kagura performances along with a procession in traditional attire.

==Kasugayama Primeval Forest==
Kasugayama Primeval Forest is primeval forest of about 250 hectares (620 acres) near the summit of Kasugayama (498 metres (1,634 ft)), and contains 175 kinds of trees, 60 bird types, and 1,180 species of insects. In this area adjacent to Kasuga Grand Shrine, hunting and logging have been prohibited since 841 CE. Because Kasugayama has long been tied to Kasuga Grand Shrine worship, it is regarded as a sacred hill. The forest backdrop of the Kasuga Grand Shrine&#x27;s buildings today has been unchanged since the Nara period.

<text>Dying Fetus is an American death metal band from Greater Upper Marlboro, Maryland, formed in 1991. Various lineup changes throughout the years have left John Gallagher as the sole remaining original member, as well as the band&#x27;s driving force. According to Gallagher, the band name was chosen while the members were young and was intended to be offensive. To date, Dying Fetus has released nine studio albums.

== History ==
=== Beginnings (1991–1996) ===

Dying Fetus was founded in 1991 in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, by John Gallagher (guitar, vocals) and Jason Netherton (bass, vocals). The band began in earnest when the pair met up with guitarist/vocalist Nick Speleos in 1992. It was decided then that Gallagher would fill in on drums until a proper drummer was found. The writing of this period resulted in the 1993 demo &quot;Bathe In Entrails.&quot; In late 1993, the band found drummer Rob Belton, as well as guitarist Brian Latta, who replaced the departing Nick Speleos (which also thrust John Gallagher back into the role of guitarist and vocalist). Together the new four-piece lineup recorded the &quot;Infatuation with Malevolence&quot; demo in early 1994, later released together with the first demo in 1995 as a compilation on California Indie label Wild Rags Records. Songs included all tracks from both demos as one CD.

In 1996, the band released their first album, &quot;Purification through Violence&quot;, on short-lived Illinois label Pulverizer Records. The album marked a further refinement of the band&#x27;s developing sound of death metal riffing, combined with heavy slams, over seven original songs, and one Napalm Death cover, &quot;Scum&quot;. Drummer Rob Belton left and the band was joined briefly in 1995 for a year by drummer Casey Buckler, with whom they performed live, yet never recorded with. Casey was asked to leave the band as they agreed he would play drums for a tour they had that year.

=== Rise to underground prominence (1996–2000) ===

Relying on self-promotion, the band toured sporadically for 4 years straight starting in summer 1996 with their first full US tour alongside Kataklysm and Monstrosity, with the first appearance of future drummer Erik Sayenga as drummer replacing Casey Buckler. However, by spring 1997, Erik Sayenga left the band, and during a short Texas tour in May 1997, drummer Kevin Talley was located and subsequently joined full-time by the summer of 1997. At this point, the band caught the attention of German indie label Morbid Records, who signed them early in 1998 for a one-album deal. Almost immediately afterwards, the band released their second album, &quot;Killing on Adrenaline&quot;.

Morbid Records supplied the band with modest promotion in the death metal underground by releasing the album in Europe (while the band released it on their own label &#x27;Blunt Force Records&#x27; in North America). Subsequently, they rose to prominence with notable live performances, such as appearances at Milwaukee metalfest (1998-2000) and tours in the US and Canada in 1998 (with Deeds of Flesh) and in Europe (with Deranged). However, guitarist Brian Latta left the band in late 1998, ushering in new guitarist &quot;Sparky&quot; Voyles, and in 1999 the band embarked on their first headlining tour of the US, over three weeks dubbed the &quot;Underground Terrorism&quot; tour. The tour was followed shortly thereafter by the &quot;Grotesque Impalement&quot; EP, which the band again released on their own Blunt Force Records label imprint.

=== Relapse Records and new lineup (2000–2003) ===
By 2000, Dying Fetus caught the attention of another underground metal label, the indie company Relapse Records, who subsequently signed the band.

Once more returning to Steve Carr&#x27;s Hit and Run Studios in Maryland (where each previous Dying Fetus album was recorded), Dying Fetus recorded in the spring of 2000 their Relapse debut (and overall third full-length album), &quot;Destroy the Opposition&quot;. This album featured even stronger political themes, and songwriting that was to highly influence the &quot;deathcore&quot; scene in subsequent years. The album was included in &quot;Decibel&quot;″s Top 100 Albums of the decade list for the 2000s (Decibel Magazine Special Edition, December 2009), as well as to Decibel&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; (#89, July 2012).

However, following the release of &quot;Destroy the Opposition&quot;, original member Jason Netherton left the band for personal reasons, and thereafter guitarist Voyles and drummer Talley left the band only months after the album&#x27;s release (they since went on to form the band Misery Index). Gallagher recruited guitarist Mike Kimball, singer Vince Matthews, bassist/backup vocalist Sean Beasley, and the returning Eric Sayenga on drums.

With the new lineup, the band released their 4th album, &quot;Stop at Nothing&quot;, in 2003, another album featuring Carr&#x27;s production and strong political themes. A promotional video was shot for the track &quot;One Shot, One Kill&quot;.

=== Lineup changes, return to form (2003–present) ===

Dying Fetus toured extensively for &quot;Stop at Nothing&quot;, and got airplay for the music video for &quot;One Shot, One Kill&quot; on Headbanger&#x27;s Ball. Another vehicle that led to exposure of the band was further support from Relapse Records (with acts such as Mastodon gaining popularity), as well as a full North American tour with GWAR in 2005. However, the &quot;Stop at Nothing&quot; lineup dissolved slightly in the years that followed as drummer Erik Sayenga parted yet again, and singer Vince Matthews went on to form Criminal Element. However, Dying Fetus came back yet again, bassist Beasley took over on vocals, and drummer Duane Timlin (ex-Divine Empire/Broken Hope) joined the ranks in 2006.

That lineup then recorded &quot;War of Attrition&quot;, which was released in March 2007. Themes include attacking reality TV, the war on terrorism, racial ignorance, and the flaws in the criminal justice system. Songs include &quot;Homicidal Retribution&quot;, &quot;Raping the System&quot;, and &quot;Parasites of Catastrophe&quot;. Dying Fetus&#x27; second music video was made for &quot;Homicidal Retribution&quot;.

Yet another lineup change occurred on the Dying Fetus front in July 2007: drummer Duane Timlin was fired due to incompatibilities. The newest drummer for the band is Trey Williams, from the local Baltimore band Severed Head. Mike Kimball also left the band and they&#x27;ve remained a trio since.

On September 15, 2009, Dying Fetus released their sixth album, &quot;Descend into Depravity&quot; on Relapse Records. Three years later, their follow-up to this record &quot;Reign Supreme&quot;, would be released on June 19, 2012. The band released the first single from the album, &quot;Subjected to a Beating&quot;, on April 2, 2012.

Dying Fetus headlined a US tour being supported by Exhumed, Abiotic and Waking the Cadaver. Devourment was intended to be on the bill to play the tour, but dropped off a month beforehand. Rivers of Nihil appeared in select spots of the tour.

On November 4, 2013, after Avenged Sevenfold were announced as a headliner for Download Festival 2014, a fan of the band claimed that other bands were more deserving of a headline spot at the festival, and said &quot;Everyone is going on about that this is good to give new blood a chance, then why not Machine Head, Lamb of God, Testament, Dying Fetus or Carcass? Give them a chance&quot;. Due to the smaller size of the band&#x27;s fanbase, this sparked a mock internet campaign with the hashtag &quot;#WhyNotDyingFetus?&quot; trending worldwide. On November 6, 2013, Andy Copping announced on his Twitter feed that due to the internet campaign, Dying Fetus had been confirmed to be playing at the festival. The band were the first to play the main stage on the Saturday.

By June 2016, Dying Fetus had been working on their eighth studio album, which was expected to be released in the summer of 2017.

By mid-April 2017, both the band and Relapse Records had announced via social media the release of their eighth studio album, entitled &quot;Wrong One to Fuck With&quot;, which was released on June 23, 2017, and included a promotional video for Gallagher, Williams, Beasley, and Associates – Death Metal Attorneys at Law.

In 2019, the band&#x27;s music was featured on the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Band in China&quot;.

== Musical style ==
Dying Fetus has been described as death metal, grindcore, brutal death metal, and technical death metal, incorporating elements of each into their musical style. 

Their sound is noted for its &quot;vicious&quot; blast beats as well as the guttural vocal style of frontman John Gallagher.

<text>Bikya (also known as Furu) is a potentially extinct Southern Bantoid language spoken in Cameroon. It is one of the three, or four, Furu languages. In 1986 four surviving speakers were identified, although only one (a man in his seventies) spoke the language fluently.

English linguist Dr. David Dalby filmed an 87-year-old African woman who spoke Bikya as her native tongue. At the time, it was believed that she was the last Bikya speaker.

It, and presumably all of Furu, is perhaps a Beboid language.

<text>Thomas MacLellan, born at Glenshinnoch (present-day Orchardton Castle), Auchencairn, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, was the 2nd Lord Kirkcudbright, a title he held from 1639 his passing in 1647. 

== Biography ==

Thomas was the son of William MacLellan of Glenshinnoch and Rosina Agnew. His father&#x27;s brother was Robert MacLellan 1st Lord Kirkcudbright. As the eldest surviving son, Thomas inherited his father’s rights and titles after the death of his elder brothers. In 1608, Thomas was formally recognized as his father&#x27;s lawful son and was designated as heir to the estate of Glenshinnoch. 

Thomas MacLellan was admitted as a burgess of Kirkcudbright on 17 October 1638, as the &quot;&quot;Rycht honorabill maister of Kirkcudbright&quot;.&quot; Despite his status, MacLellan faced significant financial pressure in the early years of his inheritance. In 1639, he entered into an agreement with Lieutenant Colonel William Stewart to alleviate his debts. Through this contract, MacLellan transferred several properties, including the mill of Bardrochwood, the lands of Graddock, and other holdings in exchange for financial relief. However, by 1642, MacLellan had managed to recover much of the land that had been mortgaged by his late uncle. On 5 February 1642, he and his wife received a charter for various estates, including Twynholm, Bombie, Loch Fergus, and others, securing his family&#x27;s lands and wealth once again.

A staunch Presbyterian, MacLellan was a committed Covenanter—one of the faction of Scots who opposed King Charles I’s attempts to impose Anglican reforms on the Church of Scotland. He played an active role in the military campaigns that followed, fighting for the Covenanter cause against the Royalists.

In 1639, Thomas MacLellan commanded a regiment of 600 Scots at the Battle of Duns Law, where the Covenanter forces, led by Alexander Leslie, defeated the Royalists. The following year, he was appointed Colonel of the South Regiment of Cavalry, part of the larger Scottish force that invaded England under Leslie&#x27;s command. McLellan typically marched at the head of his regiment and carried a barrel of brandy to distribute freely to his soldiers. His regiment was stationed in and around Newcastle by September 1640, where they would stay for nearly a year. 

As part of the military campaign of 1640, MacLellan&#x27;s regiment was stationed in the town of Dumfries, where it imposed a significant burden on the local population. The townspeople complained to the Committee of Estates about the strain placed on their resources, as the regiment&#x27;s presence caused food shortages and economic hardship. On 10 December 1640, a letter from the committee acknowledged these grievances and instructed MacLellan to relieve the town by dividing his forces into smaller units.

In 1641, MacLellan was implicated in the controversial &quot;Incident of August 1641,&quot; a failed plot to strengthen King Charles I’s position in Scotland by eliminating rival noble factions, notably the Marquises of Argyll and Hamilton. Though MacLellan’s role remains unclear, several accounts suggest that he was involved in secret meetings with other Scottish Lords, discussing ways to secure the King’s authority. While this event caused significant tension, MacLellan&#x27;s involvement did not seem to diminish his standing within the Covenanter movement.

In 1643, Thomas MacLellan was given command of one of the seven regiments raised by the Committee of Estates for the defense of Scotland and against Royalist forces in England. MacLellan’s regiment was involved in several key battles during the war.

One of the most notable engagements in which MacLellan participated was the Battle of Corbridge on 19 February 1644, part of the ongoing conflict between the Covenanter army and Royalist forces. MacLellan’s cavalry played an essential role in a series of charges against Royalist troops led by Sir Marmaduke Langdale. While the Covenanter forces won two successful charges, the third charge was repelled, and MacLellan’s soldiers were forced to retreat. Despite this setback, MacLellan’s regiment later succeeded in defeating Colonel Robert Brandling’s forces in a rear engagement during the retreat.

In the Siege of Newcastle and the subsequent military campaigns in Cumbria, MacLellan&#x27;s regiment remained active, advancing into England to support the Covenanter forces under the Earl of Leven. His regiment participated in the Siege of Carlisle, where he commanded a key segment of the besieging forces and led cavalry against Royalist defenders.

During the Siege of Carlisle, MacLellan became embroiled in a dispute with Lieutenant Colonel Beecher, who was commanding forces at Botcherby Mount near the city. MacLellan argued that he held seniority and should assume command of the entire siege operation, but Beecher refused, citing his own orders from Sir Wilfred Lawson. The dispute was a reflection of the increasingly fractious nature of the Covenanter-parliamentarian alliance, where internal rivalries often undermined military coordination. Although MacLellan attempted to undermine Beecher by accusing him of being anti-Covenanter, the conflict resulted in MacLellan being sidelined temporarily, with his regiment’s movements becoming more limited.

MacLellan’s fortunes were restored following the Covenanter victory at the Battle of Philiphaugh on 13 September 1645. His cavalry played an important role in the engagement, where the Covenanter forces defeated the Royalist troops. His regiment also served in various campaigns throughout Scotland and Northern England during the final years of the war, including expeditions to Aberdeen and Banff in October 1645.

Despite his involvement in the war, MacLellan’s military career began to wind down after February 1647, when his regiment was disbanded by order of the Committee of Estates. At the time, MacLellan was informed that he would receive £12,963 in arrears due to his troops, but he was soon ordered to disband them. After this, MacLellan traveled to Ireland, where he passed away in May 1647, just a few months after the disbandment of his forces. 

Thomas MacLellan married Jonet Douglas, the daughter of William, 1st Earl of Queensberry, on 28 July 1640. Their marriage was a strategic alliance with one of the most powerful families in southern Scotland. However, their union did not produce any surviving children, as Jonet Douglas passed away in 1651. MacLellan was succeeded by his cousin, John MacLellan 3rd Lord Kirkcudbright.

<doc id="869207" wikidata="Q447907" url="?curid=869207" title="Hank Jones">
<text>Henry Jones Jr. (July 31, 1918 – May 16, 2010) was an American jazz pianist, bandleader, arranger, and composer. Critics and musicians described Jones as eloquent, lyrical, and impeccable. In 1989, The National Endowment for the Arts honored him with the NEA Jazz Masters Award. He was also honored in 2003 with the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) Jazz Living Legend Award. In 2008, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. On April 13, 2009, the University of Hartford presented Jones with an honorary Doctorate of Music for his musical accomplishments.

Jones recorded more than 60 albums under his own name, and countless others as a sideman, including Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s celebrated album &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot;. On May 19, 1962, he played piano as actress Marilyn Monroe sang her famous &quot;Happy Birthday, Mr. President&quot; song to then U.S. president John F. Kennedy.

==Biography==
Born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Jones moved to Pontiac, Michigan, where his father, Henry Jones Sr., a Baptist deacon and lumber inspector, bought a three-story brick home. One of seven children, Jones was raised in a musical family. His mother Olivia Jones sang; his two older sisters studied piano; and his two younger brothers—Thad, a trumpeter, and Elvin, a drummer—also became prominent jazz musicians. He studied piano at an early age and came under the influence of Earl Hines, Fats Waller, Teddy Wilson, and Art Tatum. By the age of 13, Jones was performing locally in Michigan and Ohio. While playing with territory bands in Grand Rapids and Lansing in 1944, he met Lucky Thompson, who invited Jones to work in New York City at the Onyx Club with Hot Lips Page.

In New York City, Jones regularly listened to leading bop musicians, and was inspired to master the new style. While practicing and studying the music he worked with John Kirby, Howard McGhee, Coleman Hawkins, Andy Kirk, and Billy Eckstine. In autumn 1947, he began touring in Norman Granz&#x27;s Jazz at the Philharmonic package, and from 1948 to 1953 he was accompanist for Ella Fitzgerald, and accompanying her in England in the fall of 1948, developed a harmonic facility of extraordinary taste and sophistication. During this period he also made several historically important recordings with Charlie Parker, which included &quot;The Song Is You&quot;, from the &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot; album, recorded in December 1952, with Teddy Kotick on bass and Max Roach on drums.

Engagements with Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman followed, and recordings with artists such as Lester Young, Cannonball Adderley, and Wes Montgomery, in addition to being for a time, &quot;house pianist&quot; on the Savoy label. From 1959 through 1975 Jones was staff pianist for CBS studios. This included backing guests such as Frank Sinatra on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. He played the piano accompaniment to Marilyn Monroe as she sang &quot;Happy Birthday Mr. President&quot; to John F. Kennedy on May 19, 1962. By the late 1970s, his involvement as pianist and conductor with the Broadway musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; (based on the music of Fats Waller) had informed a wider audience of his unique qualities as a musician.

During the late 1970s and the 1980s, Jones continued to record prolifically, as an unaccompanied soloist, in duos with other pianists (including John Lewis and Tommy Flanagan), and with various small ensembles, most notably the Great Jazz Trio. The group took this name in 1976, by which time Jones had already begun working at the Village Vanguard with its original members, Ron Carter and Tony Williams (it was Buster Williams rather than Carter, however, who took part in the trio&#x27;s first recording session in 1976); by 1980 Jones&#x27; sidemen were Eddie Gómez and Al Foster, and in 1982 Jimmy Cobb replaced Foster. The trio also recorded with other all-star personnel, such as Art Farmer, Benny Golson, and Nancy Wilson. In the early 1980s Jones held a residency as a solo pianist at the Cafe Ziegfeld and made a tour of Japan, where he performed and recorded with George Duvivier and Sonny Stitt. Jones&#x27; versatility was more in evidence with the passage of time. He collaborated on recordings of Afro-pop with an ensemble from Mali and on an album of spirituals, hymns and folksongs with Charlie Haden called &quot;Steal Away&quot; (1995).

Among his later recordings are &quot;For My Father&quot; (2005), with bassist George Mraz and drummer Dennis Mackrel, a solo piano recording issued in Japan under the title &quot;Round Midnight&quot; (2006), and as a side man on Joe Lovano&#x27;s &quot;Joyous Encounter&quot; (2005). Jones made his debut on Lineage Records, recording with Frank Wess and with the guitarist Eddie Diehl, but also appeared on &quot;West of 5th&quot; (2006) with Jimmy Cobb and Christian McBride on Chesky Records. He also accompanied Diana Krall for &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; on the album compilation, &quot;We all Love Ella&quot; (Verve 2007). He is one of the musicians who test and talk about the piano in the documentary &quot;Note by Note: The Making of Steinway L1037&quot;, released in November 2007.

In early 2000, the Hank Jones Quartet accompanied jazz singer Salena Jones at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival in Idaho, and in 2006 at the Monterey Jazz Festival with both jazz singer Roberta Gambarini and the Oscar Peterson Trio.

In June 2005, Jones was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music at 20th anniversary of jazz education at the Umbria Jazz Festival, in Perugia, Italy.

<doc id="869211" wikidata="Q1937415" url="?curid=869211" title="Misery Index (band)">
<text>Misery Index is an American death metal band formed in 2001 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, by Jason Netherton (bass, vocals), Mike Harrison (guitar, vocals), and Kevin Talley (drums). In 2003, the band opened for Dying Fetus and Skinless on their North American tour. From 2006–2010, its line-up consisted of Jason Netherton on bass and vocals, John Voyles on lead guitar, Mark Kloeppel on rhythm guitar and vocals, and Adam Jarvis on drums. In 2010, Voyles left the band and was replaced by Darrin Morris.

==Background==

Misery Index&#x27;s music is best described as death metal with strong hardcore punk and grindcore influences. Its lyrics tend to be highly critical of prevailing power structures in modern culture, everyday life and the ills of modern society. Their band name is derived from the economic indicator of the same name, which was also the namesake of the last album by Assück, from whom Misery Index also draw inspiration. Through the years, the band toured extensively, performing over 1000 concerts in 44 countries from 2002 to 2013.

The band runs its own record label, Anarchos Records, through which it has released a handful of titles, including its debut EP &quot;Overthrow&quot; in 2001, the &quot;Dissent&quot; EP in 2004, and the 2010 compilation &quot;Pulling Out the Nails&quot;. Misery Index&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Retaliate&quot;, was released on Nuclear Blast Records in 2003. The band signed to Relapse Records in January, 2006, and released its second album, &quot;Discordia&quot;, in May 2006. &quot;Traitors&quot;, the band&#x27;s third album, was released in September 2008 and its fourth album, &quot;Heirs to Thievery&quot;, was released May 11, 2010. In June 2011, the band signed to Season of Mist Records, and released its fifth full-length, &quot;The Killing Gods&quot;, in May 2014. On March 8, 2019, the band released their sixth album &quot;Rituals of Power&quot;. In 2020, the band signed with Century Media Records and released their seventh album &quot;Complete Control&quot; in May 2022.

<doc id="869213" wikidata="Q261430" url="?curid=869213" title="Šumadija">
<text>Šumadija (, ) is a geographical region in the central part of Serbia. The area used to be heavily covered with forests, hence the name (from &quot;šuma&quot; &#x27;forest&#x27;). The city of Kragujevac is the administrative center of the Šumadija District in the Šumadija and Western Serbia statistical region.

The region is very fertile, and it is known for its extensive fruit production (apples, grapes, plums, etc.).

==Name==
&quot;Šumadija&quot; received its name from the dense and impassable forests which covered the region, particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries. These forests were preserved until the early 19th century; they are mentioned in literature and tradition. Bertrandon de la Broquière (1400–1459) passed through Serbia, on the road from Palanka to Belgrade he &quot;passed through very large forests&quot;. During the reign of Prince Miloš (1817–1839), Serbia was covered with dense forests, through which &quot;no one could walk through, let alone with horse&quot;. When Alphonse de Lamartine took a trip to Serbia (1833), he described the forests as &quot;like he was in the middle of the North American forests&quot;. In the Jasenica villages a tradition was maintained &quot;that everywhere there were empty forests, and settlers called relatives to come and occupy the land how much they want ... the forests were in need of cutting down trees and burning for years ... it was so impassable, that one could walk for days through it, without seeing the sun&quot;.

The region of Šumadija is surrounded by the river Morava in the east, Kolubara in the west, the Danube in the north, and the mountains of Crni Vrh, Kotlenik and Rudnik in the southeast, south and southwest. The inhabitants of this region have earned the demonym &quot;Šumadinci&quot;.

==Geography==

Šumadija is located between mountain Kosmaj in the north, city Smederevska Palanka in the east, mountain Gledić in the south, and Kolubara, Ljig and Dičina in the west. According to some interpretations (for example, physiologist J. Cvijić and ethnologist J. Erdeljanović), the northern border of Šumadija lay between Avala and Kosmaj mountain. According to that view, the capital of Serbia, Belgrade does not belong to this region.

Central Šumadija is well known for its rich horticulture, with major products being plums, apples, pears, apricots, peaches, nuts, cherries, strawberries, and raspberries.

The geological region of Šumadija includes formations of enhanced uranium, such as the Brajkovac granitic massif, and volcanites of Medvednjak, Rudnik and , with high average instance of uranium and thorium.
==History==
===Prehistory===
Archaeological sites of the Neolithic Starčevo culture and Vinča culture (5500–4500 BC) are widespread in Šumadija. Settlements of the late Starčevo phase are present in the entire territory of central Šumadija. Risovača Cave, in Aranđelovac is one of the most important archaeological sites of palaeolithic in Europe. Notable Neolithic sites include Grivac and Kusovac in the west, Divostin in the middle, and Dobrovodica and Rajac in the east.

===Middle Ages===
Šumadija was located directly northeast of Raška, the centre of the Serbian Principality. It is unclear where the exact border with the Bulgarian Khanate went in the 10th century. Prince Zaharija is known to have united several Slavic tribes along the common border to rebel against Bulgaria in the 920s. Časlav (r. 927–960), and Constantine Bodin (r. 1081–1101), may have held parts of Šumadija. The southern half of Šumadija later came under the rule of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja and the Nemanjić dynasty (1166–1371).

Central Šumadija&#x27;s three parts (Gruža, Jasenica and Lepenica) most likely existed as administrative divisions or &quot;župe&quot; (counties) during the Byzantine era. Of these, Gruža was mentioned in the beginning of the 11th century as a peripheral province. The province of Lepenica, with the status of &quot;župa&quot;, officially entered the realm of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja in 1183, and later Nemanja granted it as property (&quot;metochion&quot;) to his endowment, the Hilandar monastery, which he confirmed in the 1198 chrysobull. The province of &quot;Dendra&quot;, which was held by Serbian ruler Desa (fl. 1150–66), has been interpreted as Šumadija by some scholars, and as Toplica but it has been concluded that it was in the vicinity of Niš; Leskovac (historically Glubočica and Dubočica).

The medieval Serbian state saw its end with the Serbian Despotate&#x27;s fall in Šumadija in the 15th century.

===Early modern history===

Until the fall of the Serbian Despotate, the region was advanced, rich and well-populated. This stands out from the travellers that passed through Šumadija in that period. Many topographic names that have survived until today confirm old settlements, churches and monasteries (&quot;selište&quot;, &quot;crkvine&quot;, &quot;manastirine&quot;, &quot;kućerine&quot;, &quot;podrumine&quot;, &quot;varoševo&quot;, etc.), as does old graveyards and other traces. After the fall of the Despotate, opportunities changed. The Ottoman invasion and the events that took place in Šumadija up until the early 19th century were the primary cause for the population motion. Removing themselves ahead of the Ottomans, they left their homes, concealed themselves up in the mountains and ravines, or left in different directions. Settlements disappeared, the churches and monasteries were destroyed, and the population numbers constantly decreased. One traveller, Gerlach, described the path from Batočina to Palanka: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t find no trace of settlements or culture, everywhere there is wasteland, not a single piece of land has been cultivated, there is not a single village&quot;.
Pavle Bakić, who had estates on the Venčac, left between 1515 and 1522 &quot;with a large group of people into Hungary&quot;. Schweiger, who passed through Serbia in 1577, among other things, said that he travelled from Kolar &quot;[through] a deserted region, scarcely settled and badly processed, in three days not having seen more than five poor villages&quot;. In groups, or individually, families left their homeland and went in different directions, over (&quot;preko&quot;) the rivers, to Syrmia, Banat, Bačka and Slavonia, to Bosnia, and other regions. This flight lasted until the end of the 18th century, then again, after 1813. During the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91), in 1788, the population of the Šumadija villages Koraćice, Nemenikuća and Rogače fled &quot;preko&quot;. Among them were Milovan Vidaković, who described their way: &quot;we are watching the villages through which and along which we passed, all are already covered in grass, not a living soul in them, all has gone; vineyards, gardens, flats, it&#x27;s all empty and lying in weeds&quot;. More flights ensued after 1813. For example, the parents of activist Ilija Milosavljević-Kolarac fled &quot;preko&quot; with the rest of the peasants in 1813, to take shelter in front of the Ottoman army. In Orašac they crossed the Danube and settled in Crepaja, from where they later returned to their homes.
In addition to population emigration, there was also immigration, more or less, depending on the circumstance which prevailed in Šumadija. However, after the Austro-Turkish War, after the establishment of Koča&#x27;s frontier, when Šumadija had a more bearable situation, it saw an increasing influx of settlers with its height after the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising (1804). In the first decades of the 19th century Šumadija received most of its population. A liberated region, fruitful, and until then sparsely populated, it attracted settlers.

During the 18th century, the forests and hills of Šumadija were the refuge for the hajduk bands (brigands, rebels, guerilla fighters) that fought against Ottoman occupation. Parts of the Sanjak of Smederevo, all of Šumadija, were liberated by the Austrian army in 1718, resulting in the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbia (1718–39). After the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39), the sanjak was re-established. In 1788, the Habsburg-organized Serbian Free Corps liberated Šumadija, which, after subsequent Austrian military involvement, came together with the rest of the sanjak under Habsburg occupation (1788–92). The First Serbian Uprising, which broke out in 1804, saw the region liberated under self-organized Serbian rebels led by Šumadijan-born Karađorđe, the national hero of Serbia. The Second Serbian Uprising in 1815 was led by Miloš Obrenović who successfully repelled Ottoman forces and, by 1830, gained full autonomy for Serbia, leading to the independence of central Serbia after several centuries under Ottoman rule.

===Contemporary period===

Between 1922 and 1929, one of the administrative units in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was the Šumadijska Oblast. It roughly included territory of present-day Šumadija District with its administrative seat in Kragujevac, which is the seat of the modern district as well.

==Cities and towns==

Towns with a population larger than 20,000 include:

*Kragujevac (146,315)
*Gornji Milanovac (23,109)
*Aranđelovac (22,881)
*Mladenovac (22,346)
*Smederevska Palanka (20,345)

==Culture==
The most common folk costume of Serbia is that of Šumadija. It includes the national hat, the Šajkača, and the traditional leather footwear, &quot;opanci&quot;. Older villagers still wear their traditional costumes.

The fertile region of Šumadija is particularly known for its plums and Slivovitz (&quot;Šljivovica&quot;), whose productions are of great importance to Šumadija Serbs and play a part in several of their local customs.

==Anthropology==
===Studies by J. Cvijić===
In the Šumadija regions – Kačer, Gruža, Lepenica, Kragujevačka Jasenica, Smederevsko Podunavlje and Jasenica, Kosmaj and in the villages around Belgrade, 8,894 kin families with 52,475 households were included in the study of J. Cvijić. Of these, only 464 families with 3,603 houses were &quot;old&quot; (&quot;starinci&quot;, also called &quot;natives&quot;), which is close to the number of families of unknown descent (470 families with 2,464 houses), with the rest of the population being settlers (7,960 families, 46,408 houses). Šumadija was settled from almost all of the regions of the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia, though most of which came from the Dinaric areas, that is, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, from Raška and Sandžak, Dalmatia, Lika, and the rest of the Dinaric areas. In lesser numbers they hailed from Kosovo, from Metohija, and the rest of the Yugoslav regions.

According to the studies by J. Cvijić, almost 90% of the families of Šumadija descended from settler families of various Serb ethnographic groups. The Dinaric group was predominant, while other South Slavic regions are included in lesser percentages. This diverse population blended, mutually permeated and leveled, thus creating an ethnographic group (the &quot;Šumadinci&quot;), with characteristical psychical traits.

Cvijić noted the particular striking character of the Šumadinci as &quot;something very strong, bold, with great activeness, and healthy nerves&quot;, that many of them are capable, &quot;it seems, they manage to succeed in any enterprise&quot;, and that &quot;there is increasingly appearing personalities with great will&quot;, &quot;Foreign observers would have the impression that everyone thrives with intractible persistence and tenacity&quot;, &quot;Rigid traditionalism has almost completely disappeared. All adapt to new ways of life. There is less talk, less epic poems and epic preferences than in pure Dinaric people&quot;. Among other traits, the &quot;Šumadinac&quot; has &quot;common sense, measures and sense of reality. They know how to assess things and events fairly and without anger, when they are fully aware of these. The peasants are often characterized by sensing measures, which is rarely held by their schooled compatriots.&quot; They were shown to be a very honest and humorous people.

<text>Zhangzhou (, ) is a prefecture-level city in Fujian Province, China. The prefecture around the city proper comprises the southeast corner of the province, facing the Taiwan Strait and (with Quanzhou) surrounding the prefecture of Xiamen.

==Name==
Zhangzhou is the atonal pinyin romanization of the city&#x27;s Chinese name , using its pronunciation in Standard Mandarin. The name derives from the city&#x27;s former status as the seat of the imperial Chinese Zhang Prefecture. The same name was romanized as Changchow on the Chinese Postal Map and in Wade-Giles. Other romanizations include Chang-chow.

It also appears as Chang-chu, Changchew, Chiang-chew, Chiang-Chew, Chiang Chew, Chiochiu, Chanchiu, Changchiu from the city&#x27;s local Zhangzhou dialect pronunciation of Hokkien . This name appeared in Spanish and Portuguese Jesuit sources as &quot;&quot; as well from the Quanzhou dialect pronunciation of Hokkien , which was anglicized as Chinchew. By the 19th century, however, Chinchew as a name had migrated and was used to refer to Quanzhou, a separate port about east-northeast of central Zhangzhou.

==Geography==
Zhangzhou proper lies on the banks of the Jiulong River in southern Fujian about from central Xiamen, whose urban core has grown to form a single urbanized area with it. The prefecture of Zhangzhou comprises the southeastern corner of the province, surrounding Xiamen. The prefecture of Quanzhou lies to its northeast, Longyan to its northwest, and Shantou in Guangdong to its southwest.

===Climate===
Zhangzhou has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with mild to warm winters and long, very hot and humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . The frost-free period lasts 330 days.

==History==

According to Odoric of Pordenone, Zhangzhou was a prosperous city twice the size of Bologna.

During the early Qing, Zhangzhou was the primary Fujianese port trading with Portuguese Macao and Spanish Manila. For a time, the Portuguese maintained a factory in the city.

During the late Qing, Zhangzhou remained a center of silk, brick, and sugar production with about a million people and extensive internal and maritime trade. Its city wall had a circumference of about but included a good deal of open ground and farmland. Its streets were paved with granite but badly maintained. The bridge across the Jiulong River consisted of wooden planks laid between 25 piles of stones at roughly equal intervals. The port of Xiamen in an island at the mouth of the Jiulong principally functioned as a trading center for the produce and wares of Zhangzhou and its hinterland; both suffered economically when Indian tea plantations cratered demand for Fujianese tea in the late 19th century.

From 1918 to 1920, Chen Jiongming established the anarchist Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian with Zhangzhou as its capital.

The old city of Zhangzhou (now Xiangcheng District) was occupied in April and May 1932 by a column of Communist guerrillas under Mao Zedong. Due to the presence of Western gunboats in Xiamen Bay, arms shipments from the Soviet Union were unable to get up the Jiulong River to Mao&#x27;s forces and the main Communist bases. Discovering this, Mao retreated from the city, according to some accounts with a substantial amount of loot taken from its residents.

==Administrative divisions==
Zhangzhou comprises 4 urban districts, and 7 counties.

#Xiangcheng District ()
#Longwen District ()
#Longhai District ()

==Demographics==
During the 2020 Chinese census, the entire area of Zhangzhou was home to 5,054,328 inhabitants. Along with the 2,120,178 people of central Xiamen, its urban districts of Xiangcheng, Longwen, Longhai and Changtai, form a single metropolitan area of about 7,284,148 people.

The main language of the Zhangzhou Hokkiens is the local dialect of Min Nan, part of the Southern Min branch of Min Chinese. 

Hakka is also spoken in the rural peasant area of Zhangzhou in the west and south.

==Economy==

Babao seal paste was invented by the druggist Wei Changan as a traditional medicine in 1673. It was repurposed for artistic use a few years later and gained imperial favor under the Qianlong Emperor. It remains prized for its bright color and pleasant smell.

A major petrochemical plant, producing paraxylene, owned by Taiwan-based Xianglu Group is located in Zhangzhou&#x27;s Gulei Peninsula. The plant suffered major fires in 2013 and 2015.

==Transportation==

<text>Friedenau () is a locality (&quot;Ortsteil&quot;) within the borough (&quot;Bezirk&quot;) of Tempelhof-Schöneberg in Berlin, Germany. Relatively small by area, its population density was the highest in the city.

==Geography==
Friedenau is part of the southwestern suburbs, right at the border with the inner city Schöneberg district, separated by the Berlin Ringbahn and the BAB 100 motorway (&quot;Stadtring&quot;). It borders the Wilmersdorf locality to the west and Steglitz to the south.

The streets and squares are laid out according to a geometric urban design with an almost complete assembly of &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; buildings, which survived the bombing of Berlin in World War II.

==Urban planning==
The characteristic feature of Friedenau its Carstenn layout, named after urban developer Johann Anton Wilhelm von Carsten. This symmetrical layout consists of an avenue dividing a circular road, which is demarcated by four town squares.

Some streets in Friedenau were named after rivers in Alsace-Lorraine to commemorate the annexation of this region into the German Empire.

The majority of Friedenau&#x27;s buildings date to the early 20th century. Therefore, the architectural styles are almost uniform. 185 buildings are protected as cultural heritage sites.

More recent development does not necessarily match the surrounding cityscape, since the reconstruction efforts after World War II, especially in the earlier years, gave little consideration to the preservation of architectural uniformity.

==History==

In 1871 it was founded as an affluent commuter town on the estates of the former Deutsch-Wilmersdorf manor. The German name &quot;Friedenau&quot;, referring to &quot;Frieden&quot; (peace) and the suffix &quot;-au&quot; meaning floodplains (hence &quot;floodplain of peace&quot;), was proposed by Hedwig Hähnel, wife of the architect Hermann Hähnel, in memory of the 1871 Peace of Frankfurt, which ended the Franco-Prussian War. It was adopted by Mr. Hähnel, then the director of the &quot;Landerwerb- und Bauverein auf Actien&quot; (inc.), which developed the real estate in the area. When in 1874 the area constituted as an independent municipality within the Province of Brandenburg, the denotation had already been established and became the official municipal name.

Friedenau opened its own non-denominational municipal cemetery, today&#x27;s Städtischer Friedhof III, which soon grew too small. So in 1909 Friedenau bought a tract of land in Güterfelde (today a component of Stahnsdorf) as additional graveyard, with the first burial taking place in 1913. Friedenau&#x27;s municipal construction councillor Hans Altmann designed for the cemetery a mourning chapel, an office, a gardener&#x27;s house, a flower shop, benches and a fountain as well as a net of paths replicating the streets net in Friedenau. Since June 1913 the cemetery was accessible via the so-called cemetery train line ending at &quot;Stahnsdorf station&quot;.

Friedenau joined with the town of Schöneberg in 1920 – under the latter&#x27;s name – as the former 11th administrative borough of Greater Berlin. In the short time from 29 April to 30 June 1945, when the Red Army occupied all Berlin, it was a borough in its own right, until it was reunified with Schöneberg as one borough within the American Sector of West Berlin.

The Güterfelde cemetery, since 1920 called &quot;Forest Cemetery of Schöneberg&quot; was operated since 1935 by Berlin&#x27;s Borough of Wilmersdorf, called &quot;Wilmersdorf Forest Cemetery Güterfelde&quot; (). After 1945 the cemetery happened to be in the Soviet Zone of Occupation and later in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), thus with the increasing Eastern interdiction of West Berlin the cemetery grew inaccessible for the Friedenauers.

On 5 April 1986 a bomb exploded at the La Belle discothèque in a former cinema on Hauptstraße 78, killing a Turkish woman and two U.S. servicemen and injuring numerous people. A plaque marks the site.

<text>The Quaker Bible, officially A new and literal translation of all the books of the Old and New Testament; with notes critical and explanatory, is the 1764 translation of the Christian Bible into English by Anthony Purver (1702–1777), a Quaker. The translation was published in two Volumes in London by W. Richardson and S. Clark in 1764, but is not generally regarded as successful.

==Comparison with the New English Bible==
In 1970, following the publication of the New English Bible, Harold A. Guy wrote an article printed in the &quot; Expository Times&quot;; &quot;An Eighteenth Century New English Bible&quot;, discussing Purver&#x27;s Bible translation. Guy makes no further reference to the NEB to justify the analogy claimed by the title of his article.

Whilst both Purver&#x27;s Bible and the New English Bible endured long gestation periods, that is where any similarity ends. Nevertheless, exploring the attempted analogy can help to highlight certain factors about Purver&#x27;s version:
*Purver was a self-taught translator and laboured for 30 years with the project single-handed – compared to the New English Bible which involved a large number of academics.
*Failing to interest a publisher, Purver sold the manuscript for £1,000 to Dr. John Fothergill who published the Bible at his own expense. The two volumes sold for four guineas. There is no evidence of any volume of sales. This was in contrast to the New English Bible, which was backed before publication by the mainstream Churches in Great Britain and Northern Ireland (including the London Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends), and had a built in user base. Sales had already been &quot;road tested&quot; by the sales of the New Testament published in 1961.
*Unlike the Purver version the New English Bible was launched with nationwide publicity.
*In 1764, the Purver version was a novelty, as in the 18th century there was only one translation which held the field, and that was the King James Version. The New English Bible followed on from a number of versions, notably the Revised Standard Version.
*Despite the fact that the Purver Bible had no other competitors as an alternative to the King James Version, the Bible was not successful and although Purver prepared a second edition, it failed to see the light of day. The New English Bible in contrast, whilst receiving widespread criticism, has gone on to a second edition as the Revised English Bible.
Despite the failed analogy, in his article Harold Guy does preserve some details of the story behind the Purver version, and provides some examples of the text.

==Failure==
A portion of Purver&#x27;s translation was published in parts about 1742 by Felix Farley of Bristol, but the publication received little support. Purver failed to get the whole text published, and gained no backing for his venture, even by the Religious Society of Friends. Even when the Manuscript was published by Dr. John Fothergill at his own expense, the full translation also failed to make any impression.

Various reasons can be advanced for the failure of Purver&#x27;s translation; lack of publicity; the fact that it lacked authority (a one-man translation) and it had not been backed by any Church, not even the Religious Society of Friends, to which Purver belonged. Yet the failure to make its mark may owe itself to the deficiencies of his translation.

By some it is held to be an unreliable translation; &quot;The Dictionary of National Biography&quot; records that Purver &quot;&quot;…on arriving at a difficult passage, he would shut himself up for two or three days and nights, waiting for inspiration&quot;.
Charles Haddon Spurgeon, who was acquainted with Purver&#x27;s version remarks &quot;A Quaker Translation. Often ungrammatical and unintelligible. Not without its good points, but much more curious than useful&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="869229" wikidata="Q3635511" url="?curid=869229" title="Chacha Chaudhary">
<text>Chacha Chaudhary is an Indian comic book series, created by cartoonist Pran Kumar Sharma. The comic comes in ten Indian languages including Hindi and English and has sold over ten million copies. It has also been made into a 2002 live action television series, with Raghubir Yadav playing the role of Chacha Chaudhary, and a 2019 animated television series by Toonz Animation.

==History==
Chacha Chaudhary was created in 1971 for the Hindi magazine &quot;Lotpot&quot;. It soon became popular among kids and the elderly alike. Pran was inspired from the ancient philosopher Chanakya and elder people of every village who help and solve problems by their elderly experience.

According to a &quot;Pran&#x27;s Features&quot; press release, Indian children aged 10–13 years ranked Chacha Chaudhary as their most recognizable comic book character.

Chacha Chaudhary has also been featured as a guest in other &quot;Pran&#x27;s Features&quot; series, with Billoo, Pinki.

==Synopsis==
Chacha Chaudhary is a middle class Indian, an extremely intelligent old man. The word &quot;chacha&quot; means uncle in Hindi, while Chaudhary is a term used for landlords. A common saying about him is that &quot;Chacha Chaudhary ka dimagh computer se bhi tez chalta hai&quot; (Chacha Chaudhary&#x27;s brain works faster than a computer), which is a testament to his unparalleled wisdom and wits.

Chacha Chaudhary&#x27;s attire includes his red turban, a wooden stick, a waistcoat with a double inside pocket, and a pocket watch. His household consists of his wife Bini Chachi, a faithful street dog called Rocket and a giant alien from Jupiter named Sabu. He has an identical twin brother Chhajju Chaudhary, who visits him very rarely but whenever he arrives creates a funny situation. Sometimes, a tiny man called &#x27;Tingu Master&#x27; is also shown to live with them. Chacha Chaudhary enjoys eating watermelon with relish but mangoes are his weakness, and often takes off for a walk with Sabu and Rocket, whenever Chaachi nags him. When he takes off his turban, it is shown that he is completely bald.

Everybody in town knows that whenever Chacha Chaudhary goes out with his family, he never locks the door of his house; but nobody has been successful in robbing his house. However, in certain stories, Chaachi (his wife) has been seen locking the house.

Sometimes his head or nose itches when any trouble is going to happen.

==Analysis==
When asked about the inspiration for the series, Pran said, &quot;Each family has its own wise old man. He solved his problems with common sense, but with a touch of humor. Humor is the basis of my cartoon.&quot; According to Pran, it was his pleasure to bring relief to the common man suppressed by various work loads of that era. Pran&#x27;s hometown was Lahore, and came to India during partition of Indo-Pakistan.

Chacha Chaudhary is remarkably different from most other comic-book superheroes in that he is not a muscleman, nor does he have any extraordinary powers or modern gadgets. Instead, he uses &quot;a brain sharper than a needle and faster than a super-computer&quot; (&quot;Chacha Chaudhary ka dimaag computer se bhi tez chalta hai&quot;), and a wooden stick, to fight evil-doers. Many times, he takes help of a faithful alien from Jupiter, Sabu, who is like a son to him.

Chacha Chaudhary&#x27;s characterization, like that of Pran&#x27;s other characters, is around middle class typical Indian metro surroundings of the 1970s and 1980s, and it has kept evolving. The usual villains are corrupt government officials, thieves, roadside goons &amp; bullies, tricksters, cons and local thugs. He not only fights them and helps the common man but also teaches them moral lessons and good behavior. Most of the events end up with goons embarrassed by their deeds. One can see the middle class dealing with everyday problems. In a way Pran takes a whip at those problems but still maintains a happy-go-lucky feel with twinkling eyes and smiling faces.

==Characters==

===Sabu===
Sabu is an alien from the planet Jupiter, always faithful to Chacha and provides the physical strength in time of need. He is huge and incredibly strong, standing at about 15 feet tall. Though his size has been highly inconsistent throughout the comic series. In some comics he is able to increase his size. In certain other stories he also comes out only when Chacha Chaudhary rubs a lamp (much like Aladdin). He wears only a wrestler&#x27;s &quot;kachha&quot; (briefs), a pair of ear-rings and a pair of gum-boots. But in some comics, Sabu was shown wearing slim fit green trousers.

Sabu decided to stay on Earth with Chacha when he tasted delicious paratha and halwa made by Chachi during his visit to earth. Both Chacha and Chachi treat Sabu like their own son and in certain stories Chachi is shown to have more affection for Sabu than even Chacha Chaudhary. Sabu has a twin brother called Dabu and the giant earrings that Sabu wears were gifted to him by his mother when he left Jupiter. According to the comics, whenever Sabu gets angry, a volcano erupts at some distant place (this is stated in a panel with a picture of a volcano erupting, which says, &quot;When Sabu is Angry, a Volcano Erupts at some distant place in Jupiter&quot;). Whenever he performs an act of great strength, he utters the cry, &quot;Hu-Huba!&quot;. Sometimes he has been found to utter &quot;Jai Bajrang Bali&quot; which roughly translates to &quot;Hail Hanuman&quot; (a popular Hindu God). It is revealed in some comics that and Sabu eats 202 chapatis, 14 kilos of halwa, 22 kilos of rice / pulao, 7 kilos of vegetable preparations, 10 kilos curry, and about 18 litres of lassi (the favourite part of his meal) in one meal. He often finishes the meal with a basketful of fruit. He is often served lassi, tea, juice or some other non-alcoholic drink in a large bucket or pot. He is not married, and avoids the topic.

Unlike Chacha, Sabu does not have much wisdom, intelligence or wits and mainly relies on his physical strength. However, he has quick reflexes and has often saved the life of Chacha with his immense power and lightning-fast reflexes, often acting at the last moment when any goon tries to kill Chacha. In certain stories, Sabu is also shown to be wise, but not like Chacha Chaudhary (like the one where he finds out about an escaped prisoner or the one where he throws his huge umbrella to save people from drowning).

Sabu&#x27;s biggest enemy is Raaka, who is of the same size as that of Sabu, and is immortal, thanks to a special Ayurvedic medicine he accidentally consumed. Raaka and Sabu are both strong but Sabu always wins in their fights. Since Sabu can&#x27;t kill Raaka, he always leaves him at a place where he cannot bother humanity. However, somehow Raaka manages to escape and wreak havoc upon return. This has resulted in a series of comics on Raaka, which have been very popular and well received.

===Bini Chachi===
Chacha Chaudhary&#x27;s wife Bini is a dominating lady who is the boss of the house and occasionally battles the thieves with her belan (rolling pin). She is usually dressed in polka dotted sari and has a hair style matching 1970s style of Indian actresses. Although very kind hearted with all the attributes of a strict but caring wife, she often nags Chacha of not buying her gold bangles, not taking her out, and the fact that she has to cook a lot for Sabu although she serves as a motherly figure for Sabu. In one comic she is shown stirring a giant pot with a ladle for Sabu and serving him more affectionately than Chacha.

In one of the comics, Bini&#x27;s history was revealed. She was actually an actress who decided to marry Chacha Chaudhary after he saved her life from goons who were threatening her to give them all her jewellery or they would kill her.

===Chhajju Chaudhary===

A secret that many of the characters in the comics do not know is that Chacha Chaudhary has a twin brother named Chhajju Chaudhary, who is mentally not as gifted as Chacha Chaudhary. In many stories he proves to be the secret weapon to dodge the corrupts and goons. He was once taken to Mars by aliens mistaking him as Chacha Chaudhary.

===Rocket (Raket)===

Rocket is Chacha Chaudhary&#x27;s pet dog. He was found as a stray dog and was adopted by Chacha, much to the dismay of his wife, who said that raising Sabu in itself was a handful for her. Though she later accepted the dog when it attacked the burglars in the house. He is rather well known as Raket. The only characteristic of this dog is defined in the line &quot;Chacha Chaudhary ka kutta ssurrlup ssurrlup doodh peeta hai&quot; (Chacha Chaudhary&#x27;s dog drinks milk) and the fact that he is the only vegetarian dog in the whole world. The dog has proven himself at occasions, attacking his foes on command.

===Tingu Master===
Tingu Master is a tiny man (probably a midget) who is often seen in the comics along with Chacha Chaudhary and Sabu. He usually is shown to be a very unlucky person, falling into problems and danger which are either aimed at Chacha Chaudhary or are purely situational. However, at certain points he has come to the forefront to actually save Chacha Chaudhary from a potential death or defeat. Like Sabu, he is shown to be loyal, albeit, he is not as significant a character as the former. Many times, the comic situations in the stories have revolved around Tingu Master being very tiny, which makes others fail to notice him and accidentally perform actions like dumping him away with garbage.

===Dag Dag===
Dag Dag is actually Chacha Chaudhary&#x27;s truck which he drives. However, with a twist, It is revealed that Dag Dag is actually half machine and half human. On several occasions when thieves try to steal Dag Dag, it refuses to start. Also, if Chacha Chaudhary is in trouble, as soon as he whistles, Dag Dag comes at full speed and collides with the one who is troubling him.
===Gobar Singh and Dhamaka Singh===
Main enemies of Chacha Chaudhary are Gobar Singh and Dhamaka Singh. They are robbers who are always punished by Chacha Chaudhary. Sometimes they try to harm Chacha Chaudhary but end up harming themselves. Dhamaka Singh often brings his other stooges to attack Chacha and Sabu but his plans always backfire. Two of Dhamaka Singh&#x27;s recurring accomplices are Paleeta and Ruldu.

===Raaka===
A significant enemy of both Chacha and Sabu is Raaka. Raaka was once a dacoit who was chased by cops. Trying to evade the cops, he hid in a building and a gunfight ensued. When out of ammunition, he tried to commit suicide by drinking poison he found in the house he was hiding in. Unknown to him, the house belonged to a great knowledgeable sage called Chakramacharya, who had developed a potion of immortality. Fearing it would be misused, he had labeled the potion as &quot;Poison&quot;. Raaka mistakenly eats the immortality potion believing it to be poison and kills Chakramacharya who tries to stop him from doing so. Once he notices he has become immortal, his mischief increases and he no longer remains a mere dacoit.
There&#x27;s a comic series on Raaka and his fights with Sabu which Sabu manages to win with the wisdom of Chacha helping him. Since Sabu cannot kill Raaka, Chacha always advises him to dump Raaka somewhere where he cannot harm humans. The places comprise space, deep inside the ocean, frozen on the North pole, etc. However, Raaka somehow manages to escape and that&#x27;s what subsequent comics narrate.
Chacha Chaudhary and Sabu have once forced Raaka to shave off his mustache as a result of some competition which was won by Chacha. Chacha&#x27;s comic with Raaka, &quot;Raaka ki Waapsi&quot; (The Return of Raaka) is one of the best selling comics of Pran&#x27;s Features. Raaka was put to sleep by some potion given by a saint from the Himalayas (who happened to be the Guru of Chakramacharya) and buried in the ocean on the first encounter. On his return by another potion he was reduced to a small size, closed in a bottle and buried in a grave. But this was not the end. He returned several times again to wreak havoc in the city.
Finally Chacha Chaudhary and Sabu buried him in an endless hole somewhere near a rocket launch site. But for the last time (Comic- Raaka ki Akhiri Jung) he was thrown in a whirlpool in an ocean. He returned from whirlpool in Raaka&#x27;s anger and is thrown into space In the latest comic (Raaka&#x27;s terror) Raaka returns back this time from space. He was defeated again by chacha chaudhary and sabu and thrown in an acid tank where his body get dissolved in acid and he is converted into liquid state. This liquid state has been stored securely to prevent any escape route for Raaka.

<doc id="869231" wikidata="Q7760066" url="?curid=869231" title="The Register of the Victoria Cross">
<text>The Register of the Victoria Cross is a reference work that provides brief information on every Victoria Cross awarded until the publication date. Each entry provides a summary of the deed, along with a photograph of the recipient and the following details where applicable or available–rank, unit, other decorations, date of gazette, place/date of birth, place/date of death, memorials, town/county connections, and any remarks. The book was first published by the quarterly magazine, &quot;This England&quot; in 1981, a revised and enlarged edition in 1988 and a third edition in 1997. There is no editor noted on the cover page or the title page, but Nora Buzzell is acknowledged in all three editions, especially in the 1988 and 1997 editions as &quot;compiled and researched for &quot;This England&quot; by Nora Buzzell&quot;.

==The book==
The book was written to be a single volume listing all award recipients, together with details of birth, place of deed, town or county connections and other relevant information.

The first edition of &quot;The Register&quot; was published in 1981, a year before the Falklands conflict when two more VCs were awarded. The revised and enlarged second edition, published in 1988, includes brief accounts of the deeds for which the VC was awarded. A third edition was published with amendments and new material in 1997.

==&quot;This England&quot;==
This book was commissioned and published by &quot;This England&quot; &quot;to create a definitive and lasting work of reference as a tribute to the bravery of the men themselves.&quot;

Since its foundation in 1856, there have been many claims, particularly among family descendants, that a kinsman had received the Victoria Cross. Until this book was published, those claims have been difficult to prove or deny without access to Ministry of Defence files and other Service lists, resulting in lingering disputes.

==Details of publication==
Third Edition, 352 pages, &quot;This England&quot;, 1997 () hardback. Compiled and researched for &quot;This England&quot; by Nora Buzzell.

<doc id="869236" wikidata="Q602031" url="?curid=869236" title="Jimmie Nicol">
<text>James George Nicol (born 3 August 1939) is an English drummer and business entrepreneur. He is best known for sitting in for Ringo Starr in the Beatles for eight concerts of the Beatles&#x27; 1964 world tour during the height of Beatlemania, elevating him from relative obscurity to worldwide fame and then back again in the space of a fortnight. Nicol had hoped that his association with the Beatles would greatly enhance his career but instead found that the spotlight moved away from him once Starr returned to the group, and in 1965 his subsequent lack of commercial success culminated in bankruptcy. In 1975, after having worked with a number of different bands which included a successful relationship with the Spotnicks, and several more while living in Mexico, he left the music business to pursue a variety of entrepreneurial ventures.

Over the decades, Nicol increasingly shied away from media attention, preferring not to discuss his connection to the Beatles nor seeking financial gain from it. He has a son, Howard, who is a BAFTA award-winning sound engineer.

==Early career==
Jimmie Nicol&#x27;s career break came in 1957 when he was talent spotted by Larry Parnes whilst drumming with various bands in London&#x27;s The 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar, a time that saw Britain&#x27;s skiffle-dominated music scene giving way to rock and roll which was being popularised by its Teddy Boy youth. Parnes invited Nicol to join Colin Hicks &amp; The Cabin Boys whom Parnes co-managed with John Kennedy (Colin Hicks is the younger brother of English entertainer Tommy Steele, whom Parnes also managed). After taking a temporary break from the group to be a member of the original pit band in the Lionel Bart musical &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot; at the Theatre Royal Stratford East Nicol rejoined Hicks&#x27;s band for their appearance in the 1958 Italian film documentary &quot;Europa Di Notte&quot;, breaking them in Italy and subsequently allowing them to tour there extensively. During the early 1960s, Nicol went on to play for a number of artists, including Vince Eager, Oscar Rabin and Cyril Stapleton, and was kept in regular work through Charlie Katz, a well-known session fixer during that period. Nicol has cited drummer Phil Seamen and saxophonist Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley as being his main influences.

In 1964 Nicol helped to form The Shubdubs with former Merseybeats bassist Bob Garner, a jazz line-up similar in musical style to Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, a group with whom Nicol had sat-in when they were the resident house band at London&#x27;s now defunct Flamingo Jazz Club. Other members of The Shubdubs were Tony Allen (vocals), Johnny Harris (trumpet), Quincy Davis (tenor saxophone), and Roger Coulam (organ – went on to form Blue Mink). It was at this point that he received a telephone call from the Beatles&#x27; producer, George Martin. Nicol recalled: &quot;I was having a bit of a lie down after lunch when the phone rang.&quot;

==With the Beatles==
When Ringo Starr became ill with tonsillitis and was hospitalised on 3 June 1964, the eve of the Beatles&#x27; 1964 Australasian tour, the band&#x27;s manager Brian Epstein and their producer George Martin urgently discussed the feasibility of using a stand-in drummer rather than cancelling part of the tour. Martin suggested Jimmie Nicol as he had recently used him on a recording session with Tommy Quickly. Nicol had also drummed on a &#x27;Top Six&#x27; budget label album as part of an uncredited session band, as well as an extended play single (with three tracks on each side) of Beatles cover versions (marketed as &#x27;Teenagers Choice&#x27; and titled &quot;Beatlemania&quot;) which meant that he already knew the songs and their arrangements. Producer Bill Wellings and Shubdubs trumpeter Johnny Harris (freelancing as an arranger and composer) were responsible for putting together alternative budget cover versions of songs taken from the British Hit Parade aimed at cash-strapped teenagers. Harris said: &quot;The idea was for me to try and guess which six songs would be topping the charts about a month ahead. I would do the arrangements and then go into the studio and record &#x27;sound a-likes&#x27;; the first EP (extended play) released got to number 30 in the charts. Jimmie was on drums and, as you can imagine, we covered a lot of the Beatles&#x27; songs.&quot;

Although John Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly accepted the idea of using a temporary substitute, George Harrison threatened to pull out of the tour telling Epstein and Martin: &quot;If Ringo&#x27;s not going, then neither am I. You can find two replacements.&quot; Martin recalled: &quot;They nearly didn&#x27;t do the Australia tour. George is a very loyal person. It took all of Brian&#x27;s and my persuasion to tell George that if he didn&#x27;t do it he was letting everybody down.&quot; Tony Barrow, who was the Beatles&#x27; press officer at the time, later commented: &quot;Brian saw it as the lesser of two evils; cancel the tour and upset thousands of fans or continue and upset the Beatles.&quot; Nicol could play a variety of styles: rock and roll, jazz, big band, ska and blue beat. He was familiar with the Beatles catalogue, as he was one of the &quot;Ghost Squad&quot; of anonymous session musicians turning out sound-alike versions of current chart hits for a British budget label “Top Six”, which could squeeze six ersatz cover versions onto either side of a single. Top Six, run by Australian businessman Bill Wellings, produced a cash-in album &quot;Beatlemania&quot; with 12 Beatles songs for just 14/11d. 

Starr stated that &quot;it was very strange, them going off without me. They&#x27;d taken Jimmie Nicol and I thought they didn&#x27;t love me any more – all that stuff went through my head.&quot; The arrangements were made very quickly, from a telephone call to Nicol at his home in West London inviting him to attend an audition/rehearsal at Abbey Road Studios, to packing his bags, all in the same day. At a press conference a reporter mischievously asked John Lennon why Pete Best, who had been the Beatles&#x27; previous drummer for two years but dismissed by the group on the eve of stardom, was not rehired, to which Lennon replied: &quot;He&#x27;s got his own group [Pete Best &amp; the All Stars], and it might have looked as if we were taking him back, which is not good for him.&quot;

Nicol&#x27;s first concert with the Beatles took place just 27 hours later on 4 June at the KB Hallen in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was given the distinctive Beatle moptop hairstyle, put on Starr&#x27;s suit and went on stage to an audience of 4,500 Beatles fans. McCartney recalled: &quot;He was sitting up on this rostrum just eyeing up all the women. We&#x27;d start &#x27;She Loves You&#x27;: [counting in] &#x27;one, two&#x27;, nothing, &#x27;one, two&#x27;, and still nothing!&quot; Their set was reduced from eleven songs to ten, dropping Starr&#x27;s vocal spot of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;. McCartney teasingly sent Starr a telegram saying: &quot;Hurry up and get well Ringo, Jimmy is wearing out all your suits.&quot; Commenting later on the fickle nature of his brief celebrity, Nicol reflected: &quot;The day before I was a Beatle, girls weren&#x27;t interested in me at all. The day after, with the suit and the Beatle cut, riding in the back of the limo with John and Paul, they were dying to get a touch of me. It was very strange and quite scary.&quot; He was also able to shed some light on how they passed the time between shows: &quot;I thought I could drink and lay women with the best of them until I caught up with these guys.&quot;

In the Netherlands, Nicol and Lennon allegedly spent a whole night at a brothel. Lennon said: &quot;It was some kind of scene on the road. &quot;Satyricon&quot;! There&#x27;s photographs of me grovelling about, crawling about Amsterdam on my knees, coming out of whorehouses, and people saying &#x27;Good morning John&#x27;. The police escorted me to these places because they never wanted a big scandal. When we hit town, we hit it – we were not pissing about. We had [the women]. They were great. We didn&#x27;t call them groupies, then; I&#x27;ve forgotten what we called them, something like &#x27;slags&#x27;.&quot; Nicol discovered that, aside from acting as a Beatle, he could behave much as any tourist could: &quot;I often went out alone. Hardly anybody recognised me and I was able to wander around. In Hong Kong, I went to see the thousands of people who live on little boats in the harbour. I saw the refugees in Kowloon, and I visited a nightclub. I like to see life. A Beatle could never really do that.&quot;

Nicol played a total of eight shows until Starr rejoined the group in Melbourne, Australia, on 14 June. He was unable to say goodbye to the Beatles as they were still asleep when he left, and he did not want to disturb them. At Melbourne Airport, Epstein presented him with a cheque for £500 () and a gold Eterna-matic wrist watch inscribed: &quot;From the Beatles and Brian Epstein to Jimmy – with appreciation and gratitude.&quot; George Martin later paid tribute to Nicol whilst recognising the problems he experienced in trying to readjust to a normal life again: &quot;Jimmie Nicol was a very good drummer who came along and learnt Ringo&#x27;s parts very well. He did the job excellently, and faded into obscurity immediately afterwards.&quot; Paul McCartney acknowledged: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t an easy thing for Jimmy to stand in for Ringo, and have all that fame thrust upon him. And the minute his tenure was over, he wasn&#x27;t famous any more.&quot; Nicol himself expressed his disillusionment several years later: &quot;Standing in for Ringo was the worst thing that ever happened to me. Until then I was quite happy earning £30 or £40 a week. After the headlines died, I began dying too.&quot; He resisted the temptation to sell his story, stating in a rare 1987 interview: &quot;After the money ran low, I thought of cashing-in in some way or other. But the timing wasn&#x27;t right. And I didn&#x27;t want to step on the Beatles&#x27; toes. They had been damn good for me and to me.&quot; 

==Later career and life==
Nicol reformed the Shubdubs, renaming themselves Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs. They released two singles, &quot;Husky&quot;/&quot;Don&#x27;t Come Back&quot; and &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;/&quot;Night Train&quot;. Neither of those singles were a commercial success. He was later called upon to again stand in for an ailing drummer when Dave Clark of The Dave Clark Five fell ill and Nicol&#x27;s band, Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs, filled in for The Dave Clark Five in Blackpool, Lancashire. Whilst there, Nicol was reminded of just how popular, albeit briefly, he had been as a stand-in Beatle; receiving a bundle of 5,000 fan letters passed on to him from an Australian radio disc jockey. Nicol sent a message back thanking the fans, promising that he would one day return to Australia permanently.

He was later reunited with the Beatles when his band appeared on the same bill as them and The Fourmost, on 12 July 1964 at the Hippodrome in Brighton.

In 1965, Nicol declared bankruptcy with debts of £4,066, nine months after being a temporary Beatle. After seeing news of Nicol&#x27;s bankruptcy in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Paul McCartney recommended him to Peter and Gordon who hired him for a 1965 England tour.

Later that year he joined the successful Swedish group the Spotnicks, recording with them and twice touring the world. He left them in 1967, spending time in Mexico and forming Los Nicolquinn with Eddie Quinn; Los Nicolquinn released one album through RCA Records. He also scored the music for the film &quot;El Mes Más Cruel&quot; (). In 1975, he returned to England and became involved with housing renovations. In 1984, Nicol participated in a Beatles convention in Amsterdam, where he was interviewed. 

=== Disappearance ===
In 1988, rumours of his death began circulating, where he was presumed dead at 49 years old. However, a newspaper published in 2005 said Nicol was alive and well and living in London. The last confirmed sighting of Nicol was outside his rented first-floor flat in Kentish Town, north London, in the early 2010s.

==Legacy==
During Nicol&#x27;s brief time with the Beatles both Lennon and McCartney would often ask him how he felt he was coping, to which his reply would usually be &quot;It&#x27;s getting better&quot;. Three years later, McCartney was walking his dog Martha with Hunter Davies, who was writing the only authorised biography of the Beatles, when the sun came out. McCartney remarked that the weather was &quot;getting better&quot; and began to laugh, remembering Nicol. This event inspired the song &quot;Getting Better&quot; on 1967&#x27;s &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. McCartney again makes reference to Nicol on the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions in January 1969, saying: &quot;I think you&#x27;ll find we&#x27;re not going abroad &#x27;cause Ringo just said he doesn&#x27;t want to go abroad. And he put his foot down. So, us and Jimmie Nicol might go abroad.&quot;

While appearing on the radio show &quot;Fresh Air&quot; hosted by Terry Gross in April 2016, Tom Hanks noted that he was at least partly influenced by Jimmie Nicol&#x27;s experience with the Beatles when he wrote the script for the 1996 feature film &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;

<text>Metmyoglobin is the oxidized form of the oxygen-carrying hemeprotein myoglobin. 
Metmyoglobin is the cause of the characteristic brown colouration of meat that occurs as it ages.

In living muscle, the concentration of metmyoglobin is vanishingly small, due to the presence of the enzyme metmyoglobin reductase, which, in the presence of the cofactor NADH and the coenzyme cytochrome b4 converts the Fe3+ in the heme prosthetic group of metmyoglobin back to the Fe2+ of normal myoglobin.
In meat, which is dead muscle, the normal processes of removing metmyoglobin are prevented from effecting this repair, or alternatively the rate of metmyoglobin formation exceeds their capacity, so that there is a net accumulation of metmyoglobin as the meat ages.

 Metmyoglobin reduction helps limit the oxidation of myoglobin and the oxidation of myoglobin is specific to each species. In other words, metmyoglobin gains electrons in order to limit myoglobin from losing electrons. Metmyoglobin after being oxidized by myoglobin shows the undesirable brown color which can be seen in many types of meat. Metmyoglobin is more susceptible to oxidation when being compared to oxymyoglobin. The metmyoglobin reducing activity varies across species and was studied particularly in beef, porcine, bison, deer, emu, equine, goats and sheep.

 Currently there is not a standard technique in measuring the metmyoglobin in all species. But many techniques are used including reflectance spectrophotometry and absorbance spectrophotometry are used.

<doc id="869242" wikidata="Q311351" url="?curid=869242" title="Béla I of Hungary">
<text>Béla I the Boxer or the Wisent (, ;  – 11 September 1063) was King of Hungary from 1060 until his death. He descended from a younger branch of the Árpád dynasty. Béla&#x27;s baptismal name was Adalbert. He left Hungary in 1031, together with his brothers, Levente and Andrew, after the execution of their father, Vazul. Béla settled in Poland and married Richeza (or Adelaide), daughter of Polish king Mieszko II Lambert.

He returned to his homeland upon the invitation of his brother Andrew, who had in the meantime been crowned King of Hungary. Andrew assigned the administration of the so-called &quot;ducatus&quot; or &quot;duchy&quot;, which encompassed around one-third of the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, to Béla. The two brothers&#x27; relationship became tense when Andrew had his own son, Solomon, crowned king, and forced Béla to publicly confirm Solomon&#x27;s right to the throne in 1057 or 1058. Béla, assisted by his Polish relatives, rebelled against his brother and dethroned him in 1060. He introduced monetary reform and subdued the last uprising aimed at the restoration of paganism in Hungary. Béla was fatally injured when his throne collapsed while he was sitting on it.

==Life==

===Childhood (before 1031)===
Most Hungarian chronicles, including Simon of Kéza&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; and the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, record that Béla&#x27;s father was Ladislas the Bald, a cousin of Stephen, the first King of Hungary. However, many of the same sources add that it &quot;is sometimes claimed&quot; that Béla and his two brothersLevente and Andrewwere in fact the sons of Ladislaus the Bald&#x27;s brother, Vazul. The chronicles also refer to gossip claiming that the three brothers were their father&#x27;s illegitimate sons, born to &quot;a girl from the Tátony clan&quot;. Modern historians, who accept the latter reports&#x27; reliability, unanimously write that the three brothers were the sons of Vazul and his concubine.

Béla was born between 1015 and 1020. It is debated whether Béla was a second or a third son. The former view is represented, for example, by the Polish historian Wincenty Swoboda, and the latter by the Hungarian scholars Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk. Kristó and Makk write that Béla&#x27;s name &quot;most probably&quot; derived from the Turkish adjective &quot;bujla&quot; (&quot;noble&quot;). However, the name may also be connected to the Slavic word for white &quot;(bjelij)&quot; or to the Biblical name Bela.

===In exile (1031 – c. 1048)===
King Stephen&#x27;s only son who survived infancy, Emeric, died on 2 September 1031. Thereafter, Vazul had the strongest claim to succeed the King. However, the monarch, suspecting that Vazul inclined towards paganism, favored his own sister&#x27;s son, Peter Orseolo. In order to ensure his nephew&#x27;s succession, Stephen had Vazul blinded. Béla and his two brothers fled from the kingdom.

They first settled in Bohemia, but their &quot;condition of life was poor and mean&quot; there. They moved to Poland, where &quot;they received a warm reception&quot; from King Mieszko II. According to the Hungarian chronicles, Béla participated in a Polish expedition against the pagan Pomeranians and defeated their duke &quot;in single combat&quot;. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; narrates that the Polish monarch &quot;praised the boldness and strength of Duke Béla and bestowed on him all the Pomeranian tribute&quot;. The King even gave his daughternamed either Richeza or Adelaidein marriage to Béla and granted &quot;a goodly quantity of land&quot; to him. Makk says that Béla was not baptized until just before his marriage; his baptismal name was Adalbert.


King Mieszko II died in 1034; his son and heir Casimir was forced to leave Poland. A period of anarchy followed, which lasted at least until 1039 when Casimir returned. According to Kristó and Makk, Béla was staying in Poland during this period; he may even have administered the kingdom in the name of his absent brother-in-law. On the other hand, the Polish historian Manteuffel writes that Béla and his two brothers, in contrast with the unanimous report of the Hungarian chronicles, arrived in Poland only with Casimir, after 1039. It is beyond doubt that Levente and Andrew departed from Poland in about 1038, becauseaccording to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;they did not want to &quot;live the life of hangers-on in the Duke of Poland&#x27;s court, regarded only as Béla&#x27;s brothers&quot;.

===Duke in Hungary (c. 1048–1060)===

Upon leaving Poland, Andrew and Levente settled in Kiev. They returned to Hungary after a rebellion which was dominated by pagans broke out against King Peter Orseolo in 1046. The King was dethroned, and Andrew was proclaimed king. Levente died in the same year and Andrew, still childless, decided to invite Béla back to Hungary.

Urged by his brother, Béla returned in 1048 and received one-third of the kingdom, with the title of duke. Béla&#x27;s &quot;ducatus&quot; or &quot;duchy&quot; encompassed large territories along the eastern and northern borders, including the regions of Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) and Bihar (Biharia, Romania). He possessed a wide range of royal prerogatives, including coinage. The half-denars minted for him bore the inscription &quot;BELA DUX&quot; (&quot;Duke Béla&quot;). According to Steinhübel, the mid-11th-century timber and earth walls of the fortress of Nyitra were erected in Béla&#x27;s reign.

The two brothers closely collaborated in the subsequent years. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, they together worked out a military strategy against the Germans, who were frequently invading the kingdom in the early 1050s. Ferenc Makk writes that Béla&#x27;s epithetsthe Champion or the Wisentare connected to his fighting against the Germans. The chronicler emphasizes that Andrew and Béla &quot;lived in a great tranquillity of peace&quot; even after Andrew fathered a son, Solomon, in 1053. Béla was one of the lords witnessing the deed of the foundation of the Tihany Abbey, a Benedictine monastery that his brother established in 1055.
The two brothers&#x27; good relationship deteriorated after King Andrew had the child Solomon crowned king in 1057 or 1058. The coronation was the consequence of the peace negotiations with the Holy Roman Empire, because the Germans did not acquiesce in a marriage between Solomon and Judiththe sister of the young German monarch, Henry IVuntil Solomon&#x27;s right to succeed his father was declared and publicly confirmed. Thereafter Andrew was determined to secure the throne for his son. He invited Béla to his manor in Tiszavárkony, where the King offered his brother a seemingly free choice between a crown and a sword (which were the symbols of the royal and ducal power, respectively). However, he had ordered that Béla be murdered if he chose the crown. Having been informed of his brother&#x27;s secret plan by one of his own partisans in the royal court, Béla opted for the sword, but he departed for Poland after the meeting.

He returned to Hungary, in the autumn of 1060, with Polish troops that Duke Boleslaus the Bold of Poland had provided. Around the same time, German reinforcements arrived in Hungary to assist Andrew against Béla. The ensuing civil war ended with the victory of Béla, who defeated his brother in two successive battles fought at the river Tisza and at Moson. The King was seriously injured and died soon afterward. His partisans took his son, the child Solomon, to Germany.

===Reign (1060–1063)===

Béla was crowned king in Székesfehérvár on 6 December 1060. He ordered that &quot;the wives and sons and all the property of all those who had followed&quot; his nephew to Germany &quot;should be protected and kept safe and sound&quot;, which induced many of Solomon&#x27;s partisans to reconcile themselves to Béla&#x27;s rule and return to Hungary. He reformed the coinage and introduced &quot;large coins of purest silver&quot; into circulation. In order to stabilize the new currency, Béla maximized the prices and eliminated the black market. He also ordered that weekly markets should be held on Saturdays, instead of Sundays, in the kingdom. The historian Nora Berend says that the latter measure &quot;may have adversely affected Jewish activities&quot;, because Jews, who observed the Sabbath, could not work on Saturdays.

Béla decided to discuss his innovations with the representatives of the freemen, and &quot;sent heralds throughout all Hungary to summon two elders with gift of speech from each village to a royal council&quot;, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;. A great crowd of commoners gathered in Székesfehérvár in 1061. They demanded the restoration of paganism and the murder of clergymen, but Béla collected his army and suppressed their uprising within three days. According to Kristó, the rebels might have been led by Vata&#x27;s son, John.

Béla attempted to conclude a peace treaty with the Holy Roman Empire. For this purpose, shortly after his coronation, he released all German commanders who had assisted his brother during the civil war. However, the young German monarch&#x27;s advisors refused Béla&#x27;s proposals. In the summer of 1063, an assembly of the German princes decided to launch a military expedition against Hungary to restore young Solomon to the throne. Béla was planning to abdicate in favor of his nephew if the latter restored his former &quot;ducatus&quot;, but he was seriously injured when &quot;his throne broke beneath him&quot; in his manor at Dömös. The Kingwho was &quot;half-dead&quot;, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;was taken to the western borders of his kingdom, where he died at the Kanizsva Creek on 11 September 1063. Béla was buried in the Benedictine Szekszárd Abbey, which he had set up in 1061. Following Béla&#x27;s death, his three sonsGéza, Ladislaus and Lampertsought refuge in Poland, and Solomon ascended the throne.

==Family==
Béla married, in about 1033, a daughter of King Mieszko II Lambert of Poland. According to Makk, her name was either Richesa or Adelheid. Their eldest children, Géza and Ladislauswho became kings of Hungary in 1074 and 1077, respectivelywere born in Poland in the 1040s. Béla&#x27;s third son, Lampert, was born after Béla&#x27;s return to Hungary.

Lampert was followed by a daughter named Sophia, who was first married to Margrave Ulric I of Carniola, and later to Duke Magnus of Saxony. Her younger sister, Euphemia, became the wife of Duke Otto I of Olomouc. Béla&#x27;s third daughter, Helena, was the wife of King Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia. An unnamed daughter of Béla became the first wife of a Hungarian nobleman, Lampert of the Clan Hont-Pázmány. According to the historian Martin Dimnik, Béla also fathered a fifth daughter, Lanka, who was the wife of Prince Rostislav Vladimirovich of Tmutarakan.

The following family tree presents Béla&#x27;s ancestry, his offspring, and some of his relatives mentioned in the article.







&quot;*A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady.&quot;&quot;**Györffy writes that she may have been a member of the Bulgarian Cometopuli dynasty.&quot;&quot;***Lanka is not mentioned as Béla I&#x27;s daughter by all specialists.&quot;

<text>Priit Pärn (born 26 August 1946 in Tallinn) is an Estonian cartoonist and animation director whose films have enjoyed success among critics as well as the public at various film festivals.

Pärn formerly worked as a plant ecologist; his career in animation began when he accepted Rein Raamat&#x27;s proposal to make a design for &quot;Kilplased&quot; (1974). After a brief apprenticeship in Joonisfilm, he directed his first film &quot;Is the Earth Round?&quot; in 1977.

Pärn&#x27;s most important films are considered to be &quot;Triangle&quot; (1982), &quot;Breakfast on the Grass&quot; (1987), &quot;Hotel E&quot; (1992), &quot;1895&quot; (co-directed by Janno Põldma, 1995) and &quot;Night of the Carrots&quot; (1998).

Pärn&#x27;s style is characterized by black humour, playful surrealism and a unique graphic style. His somewhat crude style marked the departure from both Rein Raamat&#x27;s overtly serious and moralizing films as well as the Disneyesque style propagated by the directors of Soyuzmultfilm. In his footsteps (and occasionally copying his style to a large degree) have followed numerous new generation Estonian film makers, most notably Ülo Pikkov and Priit Tender.

Influences of Pärn&#x27;s graphical style can also be seen in such commercial animated series as &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;AAAHH!!! Real Monsters!&quot; directed by Igor Kovalyov.

In 2002 Pärn was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Animated Film Association, and he received Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Festival of Animated Film - Animafest Zagreb in 2008.

&quot;Divers in the Rain&quot; (2010), co-directed with his wife Olga Pärn, became the most successful Estonian animated film of all time with its 18th award at KROK International Animated Film Festival in Ukraine.

Pärn had taught animation at the Arts Academy of the Turku University of Applied Sciences in Turku, Finland since 1994 and now he is teaching at Estonian Academy of Arts.

<doc id="869252" wikidata="Q148524" url="?curid=869252" title="Zewditu">
<text>Zewditu (, born Askala Maryam; 29 April 1876 – 2 April 1930) was Empress of Ethiopia from 1916 until her death in 1930. She was officially renamed Zewditu at the beginning of her reign as Empress of Ethiopia. Once she succeeded the throne after Lij Yasu in 1916, she was described as the first modern-era female head of a nation in Africa. Her official coronation was on February 11, 1917, held in the Cathedral of St. George in Addis Ababa—a capital founded by her father. She was forty years old, and childless when she was crowned empress. The first female head of an internationally recognized country in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the first and only empress regnant of the Ethiopian Empire, her reign was noted for the reforms of her Regent and designated heir &quot;Ras&quot; Tafari Makonnen (who succeeded her as Emperor Haile Selassie I), about which she was at best ambivalent and often stridently opposed, due to her staunch conservatism and strong religious devotion. She is the most recent empress regnant, as well as the last female Ethiopian head of state until the 2018 election of Sahle-Work Zewde as president. It is heard that she patterned her reign close to the British Queen Victoria’s legacy.

Empress Zewditu sought to maintain Ethiopia&#x27;s traditional values during her reign through a series of conservative policies, resisting rapid modernization. Ascending to the throne in 1916 after the deposition of Emperor Iyasu V, she was supported by conservative factions and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, who saw her as a stabilizing figure. Her rule was characterized by efforts to uphold Ethiopian traditions and the Orthodox Christian faith, contrasting with the modernizing ambitions of her regent, Ras Tafari Makonnen, later known as Emperor Haile Selassie.

Faced with significant internal challenges, she navigated power struggles between conservative and modernist factions within the country. Despite her conservative stance, Zewditu had to deal with the complexities of a nation under pressure to modernize and engage with foreign powers. During her reign, Ethiopia experienced political manoeuvring, with Ras Tafari pushing for reforms and international diplomacy, creating a dual power dynamic that defined her rule. Ethiopia&#x27;s attempts to assert its sovereignty amidst external threats, particularly from colonial powers like Italy, marked this period. Her commitment to preserving Ethiopian independence and cultural heritage was a notable aspect of her leadership. However, resistance to rapid modernization and reliance on traditionalist policies led to tensions within the government and society.

The death of Empress Zewditu in 1930, under circumstances that remain somewhat unclear, marked the end of an era and paved the way for Ras Tafari to become Emperor Haile Selassie. Her legacy reflects efforts to maintain traditional values while facing the inevitability of change. She is remembered for her dedication to the Ethiopian Orthodox faith and her role in a transitional period that set the stage for the modernization efforts that followed. Critics argue that her conservative policies may have hindered Ethiopia&#x27;s progress and adaptation to the modern world. However, supporters highlight her significant role in maintaining Ethiopian sovereignty and cultural identity during a period of potential upheaval. Her reign remains a topic of study for its insights into the challenges of leadership during a time of significant political and social change.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Baptised as Askala Maryam (&quot;Askal of Mary&quot;, a type of flower), but using the given name &quot;Zewditu&quot; (Zauditu), the future Empress was the second daughter of the &quot;Negus&quot; (or King) Menelik of Shewa, the future emperor Menelik II. &quot;Zewditu&quot; is an Amharic word meaning &quot;She is the Crown&quot;, though it sometimes appears erroneously Anglicized as &quot;Judith&quot;, with which it is not cognate. Her mother, &quot;Weyziro&quot; (Lady) Abechi, was a noblewoman of Wollo and a brief companion of Menelik II. Her mother separated from Menelik when Zewditu was very young, and the future empress was raised by her father and his consort Baffana. Negus Menelik later married Taytu Betul but had no children by this wife. Menelik had three acknowledged children: Zewditu herself; a son, Asfa Wossen, who died before adulthood; and another daughter Shewa Regga, the mother of &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu, Menelik&#x27;s eventual heir. However, the Emperor remained closest to Zewditu, who also had good relations with her stepmother, the Empress Taytu, and was part of her father&#x27;s household for most of her life.

In 1886 the ten-year-old Zewditu was married to &quot;Ras&quot; Araya Selassie Yohannes, son and heir of Emperor Yohannes IV. The marriage was political, having been arranged when Menelik agreed to submit to Yohannes&#x27; rule. Yohannes and Menelik eventually fell into conflict again, however, with Menelik launching a rebellion against Yohannes&#x27; rule. Zewditu&#x27;s marriage was childless, since she was very young during her marriage, although her husband had fathered a son by another woman. When Araya Selassie died in 1888, she left Mekele and returned to her father&#x27;s court in Shewa. Despite the hostility between Menelik and Yohannes, Zewditu managed throughout the conflict to maintain good relations with both. In a sign of his high regard and affection for his daughter-in-law, Emperor Yohannes IV sent Zewditu back to Shewa with a large gift of valuable cattle, at a time when relations between him and her father were at a particularly low point.

Zewditu had two further marriages, both brief, before marrying &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Welle. Gugsa Welle was the nephew of the Empress Taytu, Zewditu&#x27;s stepmother. Zewditu had already been on good terms with Taytu, but the direct tie between the two helped cement the relationship. Unlike her prior marriages, Zewditu&#x27;s marriage to Gugsa Welle is thought to have been happy.

=== Ascent to power ===
Upon the death of Emperor Yohannis IV at the Battle of Metemma against the Mahdists of the Sudan, in the Mahdist War, Negus Menelik of Shewa assumed power and became Emperor of Ethiopia in 1889. This restored the direct male line succession of the dynasty, as Emperor Yohannes&#x27;s claim to the throne was through a female link to the line. As the daughter of Menelik II, Zewditu would be the last monarch in direct agnatic descent from the Solomonic dynasty. Her successor Haile Selassie was also linked in the female line. Menelik died in 1913, and &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu, the son of Zewditu&#x27;s half-sister Shewa Regga, who had been publicly declared heir apparent in 1909, took the throne. Iyasu considered Zewditu a potential threat to his rule, and exiled her and her husband to the countryside.
Due to fears of instability that might be caused, the cabinet of ministers decided not to publicly proclaim the death of Menelik II. As a result, Iyasu was never officially proclaimed as Emperor Iyasu V. However, both Menelik&#x27;s death and Iyasu&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; accession were widely known and accepted. The Church authorities, the Lord Regent &quot;Ras&quot; Tessema, and the ministers agreed that Iyasu&#x27;s coronation should be postponed until he was a bit older and had taken Holy Communion with his wife, which would make his marriage insoluble in the eyes of the Orthodox Church. However, Iyasu quickly encountered problems with his rule, and he was never crowned. He was widely disliked by the nobility for his unstable behavior, and the church held him in suspicion for his alleged Muslim sympathies. After a troubled few years, Iyasu was removed from power. Zewditu was summoned to the capital, and on 27 September 1916, the Council of State and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church officially announced the death of Emperor Menelik II and deposed Iyasu in favour of Zewditu. Zewditu&#x27;s official title was &quot;Queen of Kings&quot; (&quot;Negiste Negest&quot;), a modification of the traditional title &quot;King of Kings&quot; (&quot;Nəgusä Nägäst&quot;).

Initially, Zewditu was not permitted to exercise power herself. Instead, her cousin &quot;Ras&quot; Tafari Makonnen was appointed regent, and her father&#x27;s old loyal general, &quot;Fitawrari&quot; Hapte Giorgis Dinagde was made commander-in-chief of the army. &quot;Ras&quot; Tafari was also made heir apparent to Zewditu, for none of her children had survived to adulthood. In 1928, after an attempt to remove &quot;Ras&quot; Tafari Makonnen from power failed, the Empress was compelled to crown her cousin &quot;Negus&quot;.

=== Reign ===

==== Political maneuvering ====
While the conservative Ethiopian aristocracy was generally supportive of Zewditu, it was less enthusiastic about many of her relatives. Zewditu&#x27;s stepmother and the aunt of her husband, Dowager Empress Taytu Betul, had withdrawn from the capital after Menelik&#x27;s death, but were still distrusted somewhat due to the evident favoritism she had practiced during the reign of her late husband. In an attempt to limit her influence, the aristocracy arranged for her nephewZewditu&#x27;s husband &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Welleto be appointed to a remote governorship, removing him from court. This move, while intended as a strike against Taytu rather than against Zewditu, is believed to have upset Zewditu considerably. Zewditu also suffered guilt for taking the throne from &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu, whom her father had wanted to succeed himwhile she believed that Iyasu&#x27;s overthrow was necessary, she had admired her father greatly, and was unhappy at having to disobey his wishes. Her separation from her husband and her guilt about Iyasu&#x27;s overthrow combined to make Zewditu not particularly happy as Empress. Even though he had treated her abominably, she held much personal affection for her nephew Iyasu, and is said to have wept bitterly for him when told that she was being made Empress as her nephew had been excommunicated for apostasy. Increasingly, the Empress retreated from state responsibility into a world of fasting and prayer, whilst the progressive elements that surrounded the heir, Tafari Makonnen, gained in strength and influence at court.

==== War against Iyasu ====
The early period of Zewditu&#x27;s reign was marked by a war against &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu, who had escaped captivity. Backed by his father, &quot;Negus&quot; Mikael of Wollo, a powerful northern leader, Iyasu attempted to regain the throne. The two failed to effectively coordinate their efforts however, and after some initial victories Iyasu&#x27;s father was defeated and captured at the Battle of Segale. The &quot;Negus&quot; was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa in chains, carrying a rock of repentance on his shoulders, before entering the throne room and kissing the Empress&#x27;s shoes to beg for her mercy. The heir to the throne, &quot;Ras&quot; Tafari Makonnen, was not present at this spectacle out of consideration for the feelings of his wife, who was the granddaughter of &quot;Negus&quot; Mikael.

Upon hearing of his father&#x27;s defeat and humiliation, Iyasu himself fled to Afar. After years on the run, Iyasu was later captured by &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Gugsa Araya Selassie, the son whom Zewditu&#x27;s first husband had fathered by another woman. Gugsa Araya was rewarded with the title of &quot;Ras&quot; from his former stepmother, and with Princess Yeshashework Yilma, the niece of Tafari Makonnen, as his bride. When Iyasu was captured, a tearful Empress Zewditu pleaded that he be kept in a special house on the grounds of the palace, where she would see to his care and he could receive religious counsel. She found &quot;Ras&quot; Tafari and &quot;Fitawrari&quot; Habte Giyorgis Dinagde to be unbendingly opposed, and so gave up. She did, however, ensure that special favorite foods and a constant supply of clothing and luxuries reached Iyasu at his place of arrest in Sellale.

==== Rise of Tafari ====
As Empress Zewditu&#x27;s reign progressed, the difference in outlook gradually widened between her and her appointed heir, &quot;Ras&quot; Tafari Makonnen. Tafari was a moderniser, believing that Ethiopia needed to open itself to the world in order to survive. In this, he had the backing of many younger nobles. Zewditu, however, was a conservative, believing in the preservation of Ethiopian tradition. She had the strong backing of the church in this belief. Slowly, however, Zewditu began to withdraw from active politics, leaving more and more power to Tafari. Under Tafari&#x27;s direction, Ethiopia entered the League of Nations, and abolished slavery. Zewditu busied herself with religious activities, such as the construction of a number of significant churches.

In 1928 there was a small conservative uprising against Tafari&#x27;s reforms, but it was unsuccessful. Empress Zewditu was compelled to grant Tafari, who now controlled most of the Ethiopian government, the title of King (&quot;Negus&quot;). While &quot;Negus&quot; Tafari remained under the nominal rule of Zewditu (who was still &quot;Negeste Negest&quot;, i.e. Empress), Tafari was now in effect the ruler of Ethiopia. A number of attempts were made to displace him, but they were all unsuccessful. In 1930, Zewditu&#x27;s husband &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Welle led a rebellion against &quot;Negus&quot; Tafari in Begemder, hoping to end the regency in spite of his wife&#x27;s repeated pleas and orders to desist, but was defeated and killed in battle by the modernised Ethiopian army at the Battle of Anchem on 31 March 1930.

=== Death and succession ===
On 2 April 1930, two days after &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Welle was killed in battle, Empress Zewditu died. According to some popular histories, Zewditu died of shock and grief at hearing of her husband&#x27;s death, but other accounts contradict this, claiming that Zewditu was not informed of the battle&#x27;s outcome before her sudden death. Some diplomatic sources in Addis Ababa reported at the time that the fever-stricken Empress was immersed in a large container of frigidly cold holy water to cure her of her illness, but that her body went into shock, and she died shortly thereafter.

Zewditu was succeeded on the throne by &quot;Negus&quot; Tafari, who took the name of Emperor Haile Selassie.

==Early life and education==
Born in Kasur, British India, in a Punjabi Hindu Brahmin family. Pran graduated with a BA from Gwalior and Master of Arts (Political Science) degree from evening Camp College, Delhi. He then pursued a five-year course in Fine Arts from Sir J. J. School of Art, Mumbai through distance as a private student while in Delhi, so that he could apply as a drawing teacher at schools, but he discontinued.

==Career==

Pran began his career in 1960 as a cartoonist for the Delhi-based newspaper &quot;Milap&quot; with comic strip &quot;Daabu&quot;. Apart from &#x27;this, Indian comics scenario was largely based on reprints of The Phantom and Superman. In 1969, Pran sketched Chacha Chaudhary for the Hindi magazine &quot;Lotpot&quot;, which made him famous. Pran has also created other cartoon characters like &quot;Shrimatiji&quot;, &quot;Pinki&quot;, &quot;Billoo&quot;, &quot;Raman&quot;, &quot;Channi Chachi&quot; and others, which are regularly published in Indian magazines. Pran reached lakhs of Kannadigas through his Putti, Raman that were published in Kannada daily Prajavani and Shrimathi which publishes in Kannada magazine Sudha. He was included in &quot;People of the Year 1995&quot; by Limca Book of Records for popularizing comics in India.
In 1983, the then Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Indira Gandhi released Pran&#x27;s comics &quot;Raman - Ham Ek Hain&quot; which promoted national integration. Pran received a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; 2001, from Indian Institute of Cartoonists. Pran has also given lessons in cartooning at the Pran&#x27;s Media Institute, run by his son Nikhil.

<doc id="869255" wikidata="Q7168642" url="?curid=869255" title="Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings">
<text>This article describes periodic points of some complex quadratic maps. A map is a formula for computing a value of a variable based on its own previous value or values; a quadratic map is one that involves the previous value raised to the powers one and two; and a complex map is one in which the variable and the parameters are complex numbers. A periodic point of a map is a value of the variable that occurs repeatedly after intervals of a fixed length.

These periodic points play a role in the theories of Fatou and Julia sets.

==Definitions==

Let 

:formula_1

be the complex quadric mapping, where formula_2 and formula_3 are complex numbers. 

Notationally, formula_4 is the formula_5-fold composition of formula_6 with itself (not to be confused with the formula_5th derivative of formula_6)—that is, the value after the &quot;k&quot;-th iteration of the function formula_9 Thus

:formula_10

Periodic points of a complex quadratic mapping of period formula_11 are points formula_2 of the dynamical plane such that 

:formula_13

where formula_11 is the smallest positive integer for which the equation holds at that &quot;z&quot;.

We can introduce a new function: 

:formula_15

so periodic points are zeros of function formula_16: points &quot;z&quot; satisfying

:formula_17

which is a polynomial of degree formula_18

==Number of periodic points==
The degree of the polynomial formula_16 describing periodic points is formula_20 so it has exactly formula_20 complex roots (= periodic points), counted with multiplicity.

==Stability of periodic points (orbit) - multiplier==
 

The multiplier (or eigenvalue, derivative) formula_22 of a rational map formula_23 iterated formula_11 times at cyclic point formula_25 is defined as:

:formula_26

where formula_27 is the first derivative of formula_28 with respect to formula_2 at formula_25.

Because the multiplier is the same at all periodic points on a given orbit, it is called a multiplier of the periodic orbit.

The multiplier is:
*a complex number;
*invariant under conjugation of any rational map at its fixed point;
*used to check stability of periodic (also fixed) points with stability index formula_31

A periodic point is
* attracting when formula_32
** super-attracting when formula_33
** attracting but not super-attracting when formula_34
* indifferent when formula_35
** rationally indifferent or parabolic if formula_36 is a root of unity;
** irrationally indifferent if formula_37 but multiplier is not a root of unity;
* repelling when formula_38

Periodic points
* that are attracting are always in the Fatou set;
* that are repelling are in the Julia set;
* that are indifferent fixed points may be in one or the other. A parabolic periodic point is in the Julia set.

==Period-1 points (fixed points)==

===Finite fixed points===
Let us begin by finding all finite points left unchanged by one application of formula_23. These are the points that satisfy formula_40. That is, we wish to solve

: formula_41

which can be rewritten as

: formula_42

Since this is an ordinary quadratic equation in one unknown, we can apply the standard quadratic solution formula:

: formula_43 and formula_44
So for formula_45 we have two finite fixed points formula_46 and formula_47.

Since 
: formula_48 and formula_49 where formula_50

we have formula_51.

Thus fixed points are symmetrical about formula_52.

====Complex dynamics====

Here different notation is commonly used:

:formula_53 with multiplier formula_54

and 

:formula_55 with multiplier formula_56

Again we have

:formula_57

Since the derivative with respect to &quot;z&quot; is 

:formula_58

we have

:formula_59

This implies that formula_60 can have at most one attractive fixed point. 

These points are distinguished by the facts that:
* formula_61 is:
**the landing point of the external ray for angle=0 for formula_62
**the most repelling fixed point of the Julia set
** the one on the right (whenever fixed point are not symmetrical around the real axis), it is the extreme right point for connected Julia sets (except for cauliflower).
* formula_63 is:
** the landing point of several rays
**attracting when formula_3 is in the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set, in which case it is in the interior of a filled-in Julia set, and therefore belongs to the Fatou set (strictly to the basin of attraction of finite fixed point)
**parabolic at the root point of the limb of the Mandelbrot set
**repelling for other values of formula_3

====Special cases====

An important case of the quadratic mapping is formula_66. In this case, we get formula_67 and formula_68. In this case, 0 is a superattractive fixed point, and 1 belongs to the Julia set.

====Only one fixed point====

We have formula_69 exactly when formula_70 This equation has one solution, formula_71 in which case formula_72. In fact formula_73 is the largest positive, purely real value for which a finite attractor exists.

===Infinite fixed point===

We can extend the complex plane formula_74 to the Riemann sphere (extended complex plane) formula_75 by adding infinity:

:formula_76 

and extend formula_6 such that formula_78

Then infinity is:
*superattracting
*a fixed point of formula_6:formula_80

==Period-2 cycles==
Period-2 cycles are two distinct points formula_81 and formula_82 such that formula_83 and formula_84, and hence

:formula_85

for formula_86:

:formula_87

Equating this to &quot;z&quot;, we obtain

:formula_88

This equation is a polynomial of degree 4, and so has four (possibly non-distinct) solutions. However, we already know two of the solutions. They are formula_46 and formula_47, computed above, since if these points are left unchanged by one application of formula_23, then clearly they will be unchanged by more than one application of formula_23.

Our 4th-order polynomial can therefore be factored in 2 ways:

===First method of factorization===

: formula_93

This expands directly as formula_94 (note the alternating signs), where

: formula_95

: formula_96

: formula_97

: formula_98

We already have two solutions, and only need the other two. Hence the problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic polynomial. In particular, note that

: formula_99

and

: formula_100

Adding these to the above, we get formula_101 and formula_102. Matching these against the coefficients from expanding formula_23, we get

: formula_104 and formula_105

From this, we easily get

:formula_106 and formula_107. 

From here, we construct a quadratic equation with formula_108 and apply the standard solution formula to get

: formula_109 and formula_110

Closer examination shows that:

:formula_83 and formula_112

meaning these two points are the two points on a single period-2 cycle.

===Second method of factorization===
We can factor the quartic by using polynomial long division to divide out the factors formula_113 and formula_114 which account for the two fixed points formula_46 and formula_47 (whose values were given earlier and which still remain at the fixed point after two iterations):

:formula_117

The roots of the first factor are the two fixed points. They are repelling outside the main cardioid.

The second factor has the two roots

:formula_118

These two roots, which are the same as those found by the first method, form the period-2 orbit.

====Special cases====
Again, let us look at formula_66. Then

: formula_120 and formula_121

both of which are complex numbers. We have formula_122. Thus, both these points are &quot;hiding&quot; in the Julia set.
Another special case is formula_123, which gives formula_124 and formula_125. This gives the well-known superattractive cycle found in the largest period-2 lobe of the quadratic Mandelbrot set.

==Cycles for period greater than 2==

The degree of the equation formula_126 is 2&quot;n&quot;; thus for example, to find the points on a 3-cycle we would need to solve an equation of degree 8. After factoring out the factors giving the two fixed points, we would have a sixth degree equation.

There is no general solution in radicals to polynomial equations of degree five or higher, so the points on a cycle of period greater than 2 must in general be computed using numerical methods. However, in the specific case of period 4 the cyclical points have lengthy expressions in radicals.

In the case &quot;c&quot; = –2, trigonometric solutions exist for the periodic points of all periods. The case formula_127 is equivalent to the logistic map case &quot;r&quot; = 4: formula_128 Here the equivalence is given by formula_129 One of the &quot;k&quot;-cycles of the logistic variable &quot;x&quot; (all of which cycles are repelling) is 

:formula_130

<text>Ricardo-AEA Ltd, trading as Ricardo Energy &amp; Environment, is a UK-based engineering company. It was formed on November 8, 2012, when Ricardo acquired the business, operating assets and employees of AEA Technology Plc (also known as AEAT and AEA Europe) for £18 million.

At the time, AEA Europe&#x27;s operational staff numbered around 400, located at five UK sites. After the merger, AEA continue under the leadership of Robert Bell, reporting to Martin Fausset, managing director of Ricardo UK. In 2012, the assets acquired generated annual revenues of £39 million and delivered profit margins similar to those of the rest of the Ricardo group.

==History==
AEA Technology plc was an energy and environmental consultancy business, formed in 1996 as the privatised offshoot of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). It was a constituent of the FTSE Fledgling Index. Originally it consisted of divisions with expertise in a wide variety of areas, mostly the products of nuclear-related research. These included nuclear safety, nuclear engineering, environmental protection, battery technology and non-destructive testing. It mainly acted as a contractor organisation for UKAEA and other governmental and private customers.

AEA divested all of the nuclear-related elements of its business, along with other non-core elements such as its rail business, where they had acquired NS Technisch Onderzoek among others .The Dutch branch was later sold and is now called DEKRA Rail BV. The UK branch of the rail business is now called Resonate Group Ltd (previously DeltaRail Group Ltd), having been sold to secondary private equity investment firms. AEA&#x27;s profitable engineering software business was split into two and sold to Aspen Technology (Hyprotech) and Ansys (CFX).

In addition to environmental consultancy, the company also works in the knowledge transfer and programme management areas. The business is organised around a mesh style &quot;communities&quot; structure which includes knowledge leadership (key technical consultants), project management, IT, marketing and sales.

The company&#x27;s main UK operations are located at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire (head office), London, Risley and Glasgow.

In 2001 a sub-division, EHS Solutions, was created with a remit to build an environment, health and safety software business. It acquired the environmental data management system Monitor-Pro and the health and safety software business Lexware. Significant resource was put into product development, but the market at the time was not sufficiently mature, and in 2006 Monitor-Pro was divested, followed by the former Lexware systems.

AEA Technology was fined £250,000 for transporting a 2.5 tonne 60cobalt gamma radiation source from Cookridge Hospital, Leeds to Sellafield with defective shielding on 11 March 2002. The company is no longer involved in the transportation of nuclear material.

In August 2006, AEA established a Romanian subsidiary in Bucharest (AEA Mediu); this was shut down in April 2009. The company was voted best Consultancy for Climate Change and Renewables in the EDIE Awards 2007.

AEA made 60 redundancies in 2010, reducing its cost base by 10%. The company saw a continuing slump in its share price: from 277p in November 2003 to around 0.4p in January 2012. Shares lost up to one third of their value during 2010 and were even temporarily suspended on the stock exchange. Andrew McCree quit as CEO in November 2011 and was replaced by John Lowry as Interim CEO. Lowry had previously been involved in the National Health Service as a restructuring advisor.

AEA Technology went into administration in 2012. Ricardo took on the environmental business and staff. The company&#x27;s large pension liability, dating from when it was much larger and unsupportable by the small remaining company, was transferred to the UK Government&#x27;s Pension Protection Fund.

==Rebrandings and former names==
Ricardo-AEA was formed by acquisition of AEA Technology. AEA Technology included a division previously known as the Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU); many reports published under this name are still in circulation. AEA Technology, for a time, included branding as &quot;Future Energy Solutions (incorporating the Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU))&quot;.

Another former division of AEA Technology was Momenta. This provided services to the public sector, offering services including research management, knowledge transfer, best practice, fund management and behaviour change programmes. Its major programmes included Envirowise for DEFRA and Knowledge Transfer Partnerships for the Technology Strategy Board. Momenta and the Digital Solutions Business (a small IT sub unit) were merged into the rest of AEA in the UK, creating AEA Consulting (an internal name) or AEA Europe.

<doc id="869267" wikidata="Q416833" url="?curid=869267" title="Methemoglobin">
<text>Methemoglobin (British: methaemoglobin, shortened MetHb) (pronounced &quot;met-hemoglobin&quot;) is a hemoglobin &quot;in the form of metalloprotein&quot;, in which the iron in the heme group is in the Fe3+ (ferric) state, not the Fe2+ (ferrous) of normal hemoglobin. Sometimes, it is also referred to as ferrihemoglobin. Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen, which means it cannot carry oxygen to tissues. It is bluish chocolate-brown in color. In human blood a trace amount of methemoglobin is normally produced spontaneously, but when present in excess the blood becomes abnormally dark bluish brown. The NADH-dependent enzyme methemoglobin reductase (a type of diaphorase) is responsible for converting methemoglobin back to hemoglobin.

Normally one to two percent of a person&#x27;s hemoglobin is methemoglobin; a higher percentage than this can be genetic or caused by exposure to various chemicals and depending on the level can cause health problems known as methemoglobinemia. A higher level of methemoglobin will tend to cause a pulse oximeter to read closer to 85% regardless of the true level of oxygen saturation.

== Etymology ==
The word methemoglobin derives from the Ancient Greek prefix &quot;μετα-&quot; (meta-: behind, later, subsequent) and the word hemoglobin.

The name &quot;hemoglobin&quot; is itself derived from the words &quot;heme&quot; and &quot;globin&quot;, each subunit of hemoglobin being a globular protein with an embedded heme group.

== Common causes of elevated methemoglobin ==
* Reduced cellular defense mechanisms
** Children younger than 4 months exposed to various environmental agents
** Pregnant women are considered vulnerable to exposure of high levels of nitrates in drinking water
** Cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency
** G6PD deficiency
** Hemoglobin M disease
** Pyruvate kinase deficiency
* Various pharmaceutical compounds
** Local anesthetic agents, especially prilocaine and benzocaine.
** Amyl nitrite, chloroquine, dapsone, nitrates, nitrites, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, phenacetin, phenazopyridine, primaquine, quinones and sulfonamides
* Environmental agents
** Aromatic amines (e.g. &quot;p&quot;-nitroaniline, patient case)
** Arsine
** Chlorobenzene
** Chromates
** Nitrates/nitrites
** Umbellulone
* Inherited disorders
** Some family members of the Fugate family in Kentucky, due to a recessive gene, had blue skin from an excess of methemoglobin.
* In cats
**Ingestion of paracetamol (i.e. acetaminophen, tylenol)

==Therapeutic uses==
Amyl nitrite is administered to treat cyanide poisoning. It works by converting hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which allows for the binding of cyanide (CN–) anions by ferric (Fe3+) cations and the formation of cyanomethemoglobin. The immediate goal of forming this cyanide adduct is to prevent the binding of free cyanide to the cytochrome a3 group in cytochrome c oxidase.

==Methemoglobin saturation==
Methemoglobin is expressed as a concentration or a percentage. Percentage of methemoglobin is calculated by dividing the concentration of methemoglobin by the concentration of total hemoglobin. Percentage of methemoglobin is likely a better indicator of illness severity than overall concentration, as underlying medical conditions play an important role. For example, a methemoglobin concentration of 1.5 g/dL may represent a percentage of 10% in an otherwise healthy patient with a baseline hemoglobin of 15 mg/dL, whereas the presence of the same concentration of 1.5 g/dL of methemoglobin in an anemic patient with a baseline hemoglobin of 8 g/dL would represent a percentage of 18.75%. The former patient will be left with a functional hemoglobin concentration of 13.5 g/dL and potentially remain asymptomatic while the latter patient with a functional hemoglobin concentration 6.5 g/dL may be severely symptomatic with a methemoglobin of less than 20%.

* 1–2% Normal
* Less than 10% metHb - No symptoms
* 10–20% metHb - Skin discoloration only (most notably on mucous membranes)
* 20–30% metHb - Anxiety, headache, dyspnea on exertion
* 30–50% metHb - Fatigue, confusion, dizziness, tachypnea, palpitations
* 50–70% metHb - Coma, seizures, arrhythmias, acidosis
* Greater than 70% metHb - High risk of death

This may be further compounded by the &quot;functional hemoglobin&#x27;s&quot; decreased ability to release oxygen in the presence of methemoglobin. Anemia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and essentially any pathology that impairs the ability to deliver oxygen may worsen the symptoms of methemoglobinemia.

==Blood stains==
Increased levels of methemoglobin are found in blood stains. Upon exiting the body, bloodstains transit from bright red to dark brown, which is attributed to oxidation of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO2) to methemoglobin (met-Hb) and hemichrome (HC).

<doc id="869283" wikidata="Q1166876" url="?curid=869283" title="Darwin Day">
<text>Darwin Day is a celebration to commemorate the birthday of Charles Darwin on 12 February 1809. The day is used to highlight Darwin&#x27;s contributions to science and to promote science in general. Darwin Day is celebrated around the world.

==History==
The celebration of Darwin&#x27;s work and tributes to his life have been organised sporadically since his death on 19 April 1882, at age 73. Events took place at Down House, in Downe on the southern outskirts of London where Darwin and members of his family lived from 1842 until the death of his wife, Emma Darwin, in 1896.

In 1909, more than 400 scientists and dignitaries from 167 countries met in Cambridge to honour Darwin&#x27;s contributions and to discuss vigorously the recent discoveries and related theories contesting for acceptance. This was a widely reported event of public interest. Also in 1909, on 12 February, the 100th birth anniversary of Darwin and the 50th anniversary of the publication of &quot;On The Origin of Species&quot; were celebrated by the New York Academy of Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History. A bronze bust of Darwin was unveiled. On 2 June 1909 the Royal Society of New Zealand held a &quot;Darwin Celebration&quot;. &quot;There was a very large attendance.&quot;

On 24–28 November 1959, The University of Chicago held a major celebration of Darwin and the publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, the largest event of the Darwin Centennial Celebration. Scientists and academics sometimes celebrated 12 February with &quot;Phylum Feast&quot; events—a meal with foods from as many different phyla as they could manage, at least as early as 1972, 1974, and 1989 in Canada. In the United States, Salem State College in Massachusetts has held a &quot;Darwin Festival&quot; annually since 1980, and in 2005, registered &quot;Darwin Festival&quot; as a service mark with the US Patent and Trademark Office.

The Humanist Community of Palo Alto, California, was motivated by Dr. Robert Stephens in late 1993 to begin planning for an annual Darwin Day celebration. Its first public Darwin Day event was a lecture by Dr. Donald Johanson (discoverer of the early hominid &quot;Lucy&quot;), sponsored by the Stanford Humanists student group
and the Humanist Community on 22 April 1995. The Humanist Community continues its annual celebration.

Independently, in 1997, Professor Massimo Pigliucci initiated an annual Darwin Day event at the University of Tennessee. The event included public lectures and activities as well as a teachers&#x27; workshop meant to help elementary and secondary school teachers better understand evolution and how to communicate it to their students, as well as how to deal with the pressures often placed on them by the creationism movement.

===2009===

2009 was the 200th anniversary of Darwin&#x27;s birth and it also marked the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. Events were planned, with the most prominent celebrations in Shrewsbury, the University of Cambridge and at the Natural History Museum in London.

Darwin&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;, Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, commemorated the bicentenary with the unveiling of a life-sized bronze statue of the &quot;Young Darwin&quot;, sculpted by their graduate Anthony Smith. Prince Philip (then-Chancellor of the University) unveiled the statue and it was later shortlisted for the Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture 2009. The same year, two well known evolutionary biologists, Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne, published book length treatments covering the evidence for evolution.

The Perth Mint, Australia launched a 2009 dated commemorative 1-ounce silver legal tender coin depicting Darwin, young and old; HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;; and Darwin&#x27;s signature.

The bicentenary was also celebrated by the release of a Darwin biopic, &quot;Creation&quot;, directed by Jon Amiel and starring Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly.

===Later===
On 9 February 2011, California Representative Pete Stark introduced H. Res 81 to Congress designating 12 February 2011 as Darwin Day, calling Darwin &quot;a worthy symbol of scientific advancement... and around which to build a global celebration of science and humanity.&quot; The resolution was a culmination of collaboration between Stark and the American Humanist Association, which had awarded Stark the Humanist of the Year award in 2008. In a statement on the House floor, Rep. Stark said, &quot;Darwin&#x27;s birthday is a good time for us to reflect on the important role of science in our society.&quot; In a press release from the American Humanist Association, executive director Roy Speckhardt said, &quot;Stark&#x27;s Darwin Day resolution is a thrilling step forward for the secular movement. Not only is this an opportunity to bring the scientific impact of Charles Darwin to the forefront, but this also signifies the potential for greater respect for scientific reasoning on Capitol Hill.&quot;

On 22 January 2013, New Jersey Representative Rush D. Holt, Jr., a Quaker Christian and nuclear physicist, introduced a resolution to the United States Congress designating 12 February 2013 (Charles Darwin&#x27;s 204th birthday) as &quot;Darwin Day&quot; to recognise &quot;the importance of sciences in the betterment of humanity&quot;. In 2015, Delaware&#x27;s governor Jack Markell declared 12 February &quot;Charles Darwin Day&quot;, making Delaware the first state in America to formally mark the occasion.
House Resolution 67, introduced by Representative Jim Himes in the United States House of Representatives on 2 February 2015 would designate 12 February as Darwin Day in the United States. It would recognise Darwin as &quot;a worthy symbol on which to focus...a global celebration of science and humanity.&quot;

==Darwin Day Program and Darwin Day Celebration==
In the late 1990s, two Darwin enthusiasts, Amanda Chesworth and Robert Stephens, co-founded an unofficial effort to promote Darwin Day. In 2001, Chesworth moved to New Mexico and incorporated the &quot;Darwin Day Program&quot;. Stephens became chairman of the board and President of this nonprofit corporation with Massimo Pigliucci as Vice-President and Amanda Chesworth as member of the Board, Secretary, and Executive Director.
Stephens presented the objectives of the organisation in an article titled &quot;Darwin Day An International Celebration.&quot;

In 2002, Chesworth compiled and edited a substantial book entitled &quot;Darwin Day Collection One: the Single Best Idea, Ever&quot;. The objectives of the book were to show the multidisciplinary reach of Charles Darwin and to meld academic work with popular culture.

In 2004, the New Mexico corporation was dissolved and all its assets assigned to the &quot;Darwin Day Celebration&quot;, a non-profit organisation incorporated in California in 2004 by Dr. Robert Stephens and others
and the Mission Statement was expanded.

Darwin Day Celebration redesigned the website, from a static presentation of information about the Darwin Day Program to a combination of education about Darwin and the Darwin Day Celebration organisation, including automated registration and publication of planned and past celebratory Events and the automated registration of people who want to receive emailings or make public declaration of support for Darwin Day. The website is now operated by the International Darwin Day Foundation, an autonomous program of the American Humanist Association.

Darwin Day is also celebrated by the University of Georgia. The event is co-sponsored by the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, Division of Biological Sciences, Odum School of Ecology and the departments of cellular biology, plant biology, and genetics. Mark Farmer, a professor and division chair of biological sciences and organiser of Darwin Day at UGA. Farmer said he got the idea from the International Darwin Day Foundation and brought the event to UGA in 2009 in time for the 150th anniversary of the publication of &quot;Origin of Species&quot; and the 200th anniversary of Darwin&#x27;s birth. The University celebrates the impact that Darwin&#x27;s work had on the scientific community through a series of lectures around campus.

The Ethical Humanist Society of Long Island celebrates with programs that appeal to children and adults both. The Clergy Letter Project encourages evolution-affirming churches to participate in Evolution Weekend, on the Sunday closest to this date, to learn about and discuss evolution.

Darwin Day and Darwin week is also celebrated at Southern Illinois University, and has been celebrated annually since 2006 when it commenced with a talk by Tim Berra.

==Events==
Various events are conducted on Darwin Day around the world. They have included dinner parties with special recipes for primordial soup and other inventive dishes, protests with school boards and other governmental bodies, workshops and symposia, distribution of information by people in ape costumes, lectures and debates, essay and art competitions, concerts, poetry readings, plays, artwork, comedy routines, re-enactments of the Scopes Trial and of the debate between Thomas H. Huxley and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, library displays, museum exhibits, travel and educational tours, recreations of the journey of , church sermons, movie nights, outreach, and nature hikes. The Darwin Day Celebration Web site offers free registration and display of all Darwin Day events.
Some celebrants also combine Darwin Day with a celebration of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday (February 12th). Still others celebrate the many noted individuals that influenced or were influenced by Darwin&#x27;s work, such as Thomas H. Huxley, Charles Lyell, Alfred Russel Wallace, Carl Sagan, and Ernst Mayr.

==Supporters==
Support for Darwin Day comes from both secular and religious organisations. Many Christians who support the concept of evolutionary creation, such as the Biologos Foundation and GC Science, celebrate Darwin Day, believing that evolution was a tool used by God in the creation process. Some free-thought organisations that support Darwin Day include Council for Secular Humanism, The Freedom from Religion Foundation, the Humanist Association of Canada the Center for Inquiry and the American Humanist Association in the United States, as well as the British Humanist Association
in the UK, have helped to spread awareness about Darwin Day. In 1999, the Campus Freethought Alliance
and the Alliance for Secular Humanist Societies began promoting Darwin Day among members. Humanist and sceptic groups welcomed the event and an increase in celebrations on or around 12 February spread across the US and in several other countries. The organizers behind this effort included the International Humanist and Ethical Union, Massimo Pigliucci, Amanda Chesworth, and Joann Mooney.

D. J. Grothe continues to champion this effort among groups associated with the Center for Inquiry. The Center&#x27;s branches across the world also organise Darwin Day events. &quot;Free Inquiry&quot; magazine, the flagship publication of the Council for Secular Humanism, and &quot;Skeptical Inquirer,&quot; the flagship publication of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, advertised the event and attracted further individuals and groups. The Secular Student Alliance, and other organisations committed to reason and rationality also participate in the annual celebration.

With Robert Stephens, a scientist, as its President, Darwin Day Celebration has received support from scientists and science enthusiasts across the globe. Educators began to participate by offering special lessons to their students on or around 12 February. Darwin Day Celebration has joined COPUS, the Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science, reflecting an increased emphasis on science education and appreciation.

Public relations emails to major publications led to coverage by media such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; in the UK, &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;New Scientist&quot;, the Discovery Channel. In 2006 Darwin Day was covered by major news syndicates such as Associated Press, Knight-Ridder, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Over 150 articles appeared in major newspapers across the world and helped to attract more participants.

Scientific organisations such as the National Center for Science Education,
and the Linnaean Society, have endorsed the holiday. Scientists, philosophers, historians, and physicians lent their names in support of the effort, including Daniel Dennett, Steven Pinker, Eugenie Scott, Steven Jones, Elliott Sober, Sir John Maddox, Helena Cronin, William Calvin, John Rennie, Paul Kurtz, Carl Zimmer, Edward O. Wilson, Michael Shermer, Susan Blackmore, Michael Ruse, Richard Leakey, Niles Eldridge, and Colin Tudge. Musicians and entertainers such as Richard Miller and Stephen Baird also participated.

In 2004, Michael Zimmerman, a professor of biology and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Butler University, founded the &quot;Clergy Letter Project&quot; in which over 11,100 clergy, as of 18 April 2008, have signed a declaration that a person of faith does not have to choose either belief in God or belief in evolution. In 2006 Zimmerman developed the &quot;Evolution Sunday&quot; movement. In 2007 lectures and sermons were presented to roughly 618 congregations across the United States and five other countries, on Darwin&#x27;s birthday.
Evolution Sunday is intended to show that faith and evolutionary science are compatible in many religious traditions. In 2008, Evolution Sunday was expanded to an Evolution Weekend to incorporate a wider range of faith traditions and 814 congregations from nine countries participated.

<text>Rosemary Elizabeth &quot;Posy&quot; Simmonds MBE, FRSL (born 9 August 1945) is a British newspaper cartoonist, and writer and illustrator of both children&#x27;s books and graphic novels. She is best known for her long association with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, for which she drew the series &quot;Gemma Bovery&quot; (2000) and &quot;Tamara Drewe&quot; (2005–06), both later published as books. Her style gently satirises the English middle classes and in particular those of a literary bent. Both &quot;Gemma Bovery&quot; and &quot;Tamara Drew&quot; feature a &quot;doomed heroine&quot;, much in the style of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century gothic romantic novel, to which they often allude, but with an ironic, modernist slant.

==Early life==
Posy Simmonds was born in Berkshire on 9 August 1945, the daughter of Reginald A. C. Simmonds and Betty Cahusac. Her brother is the Conservative politician Richard Simmonds. She was educated at Queen Anne&#x27;s School, Caversham. She studied at the Sorbonne before returning to London to attend Central School of Art &amp; Design, where she received a BA in Art and Design. In 1974, she married Richard Graham Hollis.

== Career ==
Simmonds started her newspaper career drawing a daily cartoon, &quot;Bear&quot;, for &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1969. She contributed humorous illustrations to &quot;The Times&quot; from 1968 to 1970. She also contributed to &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and a satirical cartoon to Tariq Ali&#x27;s &quot;Black Dwarf&quot; magazine. She moved to &quot;The Guardian&quot; as an illustrator in 1972.

In May 1977 she started drawing a weekly comic strip for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, initially titled &quot;The Silent Three of St Botolph&#x27;s&quot; as a tribute to the 1950s strip &quot;The Silent Three&quot; by Evelyn Flinders. It began as a silly parody of girls&#x27; adventure stories making satirical comments about contemporary life. The strip soon focused on three 1950s schoolfriends in their later, middle-class and nearly middle-aged lives: Wendy Weber, a former nurse married to polytechnic sociology lecturer George with a large brood of children; Jo Heep, married to whisky salesman Edmund with two rebellious teenagers; and Trish Wright, married to philandering advertising executive Stanhope and with a young baby. The strip, which was latterly untitled and usually known just as &quot;Posy&quot;, ran until the late 1980s. It was collected into a number of books: &quot;Mrs Weber&#x27;s Diary&quot;, &quot;Pick of Posy&quot;, &quot;Very Posy&quot; and &quot;Pure Posy&quot;, and one original book featuring the same characters, &quot;True Love&quot;. Her later cartoons for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot; were collected as &quot;Mustn&#x27;t Grumble&quot; in 1993.

In 1981, Simmonds was named Cartoonist of the Year in the British Press Awards. In 1982 and 1983 she contributed a regular full-page strip to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in America. In 1987 Simmonds turned her hand to writing, as well as illustrating, children&#x27;s books. &quot;Fred&quot;, the story of a cat with a secret life, was later filmed as &quot;Famous Fred&quot; and nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Short Film and several BAFTAs. Her other children&#x27;s books include &quot;Lulu and the Flying Babies&quot;, &quot;The Chocolate Wedding&quot; and &quot;Lavender&quot;.

In the late 1990s Simmonds returned to the pages of &quot;The Guardian&quot; with &quot;Gemma Bovery&quot;, which reworked the story of Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; into a satirical tale of English expatriates in France. It was published as a graphic novel in 1999 and was made into a feature film of the same name (Gemma Bovery), directed by Anne Fontaine, in 2014, and starring Gemma Arterton. The &quot;Literary Life&quot; series of cartoons appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Review&quot; section on Saturdays from November 2002 until December 2004, and was published in book form in 2003 (&quot;Literary Life&quot;) and, in an expanded version, in 2017 (&quot;Literary Life Revisited&quot;).

Simmond&#x27;s 2005-6 &quot;Guardian&quot; series, &quot;Tamara Drewe&quot;, which echoes Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot;, made its début in the Review section on 17 September 2005, in the first Saturday paper after the &quot;Guardian&quot;&#x27;s relaunch in the Berliner format. It ended, with episode 109 and an epilogue, on 2 December 2006 and was published as a book in 2007. In 2010 the story was adapted as a feature film of the same name, directed by Stephen Frears from a screenplay by Moira Buffini, again starring Gemma Arterton.

Simmonds&#x27; third, critically acclaimed graphic novel, &quot;Cassandra Darke&quot;, was published in 2018. It is loosely based on Charles Dickens&#x27; novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;; although the story unfolds in 2016-17, its eponymous protagonist is in some respects a female version of Ebenezer Scrooge, and also undergoes a profound (though more subtle and ambiguous) moral transformation.

Simmonds drew the illustrations for the opening titles of the BBC&#x27;s 2007 production of Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;Cranford&quot;, and for &quot;Midsummer Nights&quot;, a volume of opera-related short stories by prominent writers published in 2009 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Glyndebourne Opera Festival. She was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2002 for services to the newspaper industry. After being nominated already in 2001 for &quot;Gemma Bovery&quot;, Simmonds won the 2009 Prix de la critique of the French Association of comics critics and journalists for &quot;Tamara Drewe&quot;. In 2022 she was awarded the &quot;Grand Prix Töpffer&quot; (named after Rodolphe Töpffer, the author of the earliest comic strips) by the city of Geneva, Switzerland. In 2024 she was awarded the Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême, being the first British cartoonist to do so.

<text>The World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling world tag team championship contested in WWE on the Raw brand. Introduced as the WWE Tag Team Championship, it was WWE&#x27;s third world tag team title, and sixth tag team title overall. After WWE bought the promotions of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and unified the WCW Tag Team Championship into its own title at Survivor Series 2001, it split its roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown. As WWE&#x27;s original World Tag Team Championship was designated exclusive to the Raw brand, SmackDown introduced the WWE Tag Team Championship as its own championship.

In 2007, after the initiation of the ECW brand, the title was shared between the SmackDown and ECW brands, thus inter-brand matches could take place for the title. In 2009, the title was unified with the original World Tag Team Championship by The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) at WrestleMania XXV and became recognized as the &quot;Unified WWE Tag Team Championship&quot; until August 2010 when the World Tag Team Championship was decommissioned in favor of continuing the lineage of the WWE Tag Team Championship. In 2016, WWE reintroduced its brand split and the championship became exclusive to Raw. It was subsequently renamed to Raw Tag Team Championship after SmackDown introduced the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. From May 2022 to April 2024, both the Raw and SmackDown titles were held and defended together as the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship while maintaining their individual lineages. They were split at WrestleMania XL in April 2024 and the Raw championship was subsequently renamed as the World Tag Team Championship.

The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. The inaugural champions were Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit, who won the title in a tournament final at No Mercy on October 20, 2002. The current champions are The War Raiders (Erik and Ivar), who are in their second reign, both as a team and individually. They defeated The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and JD McDonagh) on the December 16, 2024, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in Boston, Massachusetts.

As of 18, 2025, there have been 95 reigns between 73 teams composed of 103 individual champions and one vacancy. The team of Cesaro and Sheamus and The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) have the most reigns as a team at four, while individually, Kingston and Seth Rollins have the most with six. The New Day&#x27;s second reign is also the longest reign at 483 days and they are the only team to hold the championship for over one consecutive year—Big E is also credited for this reign as during New Day&#x27;s first two reigns, Big E, Kingston, and Woods were all recognized as champion under the Freebird Rule (Big E was split from the team in the 2020 WWE Draft). John Cena and The Miz&#x27;s sole reign as a team is the shortest reign at 9 minutes, due to The Corre invoking their rematch clause immediately after losing the title. As a team, The New Day (across its two different variants of team members) also have the longest combined reign at 627 days, while Kingston individually has the longest combined reign at 912 days (910 days as recognized by WWE). Nicholas is the youngest champion at 10 years old (also making him the youngest champion in WWE history), while R-Truth is the oldest champion at age 52.

<text>ISO 15919 (Transliteration of Dravidian, Devanagari and related Indic scripts into Latin characters) is an international standard for the romanization of Brahmic and Nastaliq scripts. Published in 2001, it is part of a series of international standards by the International Organization for Standardization.

== Overview ==

== Relation to other systems ==

ISO 15919 is an international standard on the romanization of many Brahmic scripts, which was agreed upon in 2001 by a network of the national standards institutes of 157 countries. However, the Hunterian transliteration system is the &quot;national system of romanization in India&quot; and a United Nations expert group noted about ISO 15919 that &quot;there is no evidence of the use of the system either in India or in international cartographic products.&quot;

Another standard, United Nations Romanization Systems for Geographical Names (UNRSGN), was developed by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN) and covers many Brahmic scripts.

The ALA-LC romanization was approved by the Library of Congress and the American Library Association and is a US standard. The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is not a standard (as no specification exists for it) but a convention developed in Europe for the transliteration of Sanskrit rather than the transcription of Brahmic scripts.

As a notable difference, both international standards, ISO 15919 and UNRSGN transliterate anusvara as ṁ, while ALA-LC and IAST use ṃ for it. However, ISO 15919 provides guidance towards disambiguating between various anusvara situations (such as labial versus dental nasalizations), which is described in the table below.

=== Comparison with UNRSGN and IAST ===

The table below shows the differences between ISO 15919, UNRSGN and IAST for Devanagari transliteration.

== Font support ==
Only certain fonts support all Latin Unicode characters for the transliteration of Indic scripts according to this standard. For example, Tahoma supports almost all the characters needed. Arial and Times New Roman font packages that come with Microsoft Office 2007 and later also support most Latin Extended Additional characters like ḍ, ḥ, ḷ, ḻ, ṁ, ṅ, ṇ, ṛ, ṣ and ṭ.

There is no standard keyboard layout for ISO 15919 input but many systems provide a way to select Unicode characters visually. ISO/IEC 14755 refers to this as a &quot;screen-selection entry method&quot;.

<text>Robert Yates (January 27, 1738 – September 9, 1801) was an American politician, attorney, jurist, and surveyor. As a delegate representing New York at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Yates is considered a Founding Father of the United States. Best known as a leader of the Anti-Federalist movement, he was the presumed author of political essays published in 1787-1788 under the pseudonyms &quot;Brutus&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot;. The essays opposed the Constitution based on the scope of the national government and the diminished sovereignty of the states. Yates also served as chief justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1790 to 1798.

==Early life==
Robert Yates was born January 27, 1738, in Schenectady, New York, the oldest of twelve children of merchant Joseph Yates and Maria (née Dunbar) Yates. Among his large family was uncle Abraham Yates Jr., who served as mayor of Albany in the 1790s and cousin Peter Waldron Yates, who was a Continental Congressman and New York State Assemblyman. His paternal grandparents were Christoffel Yates, a prosperous farmer and blacksmith, and (née Winne) Yates.
He learned the craft of the surveyor and then decided to pursue a career in law. After clerking for William Livingston in New York City, in 1760 he was licensed to practice on his own.

==Career==
Surveying supplemented Yates&#x27; attorney&#x27;s income as he made a number of important land maps during the 1760s. He drew the first civilian map of Albany in 1770. He also relied on patronage from the Albany Corporation through his uncle, alderman Abraham Yates Jr. In 1771, he was elected to the Common Council as an alderman for the second ward. In those years he served on a number of committees, provided legal advice, and stepped forward to compile and issue the first published version of the &quot;Laws and Ordinances of the City of Albany&quot; in 1773.

===Revolutionary War===
From the beginning of the struggle for American independence, although he did not sign the Albany Sons of Liberty constitution of 1766, he was prominent in the local resistance to the Stamp Act. By 1774, he had joined the Albany Committee of Correspondence and stood among its first members when the committee&#x27;s activities became public in 1775. At that time, he was still a member of the Albany common council – although its activities were being replaced by the extra-legal Committee of Correspondence, Safety and Protection. He represented the second ward on the committee and was in close contact with it from his subsequent offices until it ceased operations in 1778. At the same time, he also served as secretary of the Board of Indian Commissioners – a post that required him to travel to the frontier.

Beginning in the spring of 1775, Yates was elected to represent Albany in each of the four New York Provincial Congresses. The first three met in New York, while the last one, convened after the Declaration of Independence, met under duress in locations throughout the Hudson Valley. In 1776–77, he served on the committee that drafted the first New York State Constitution and also was a member of the &quot;Secret Committee for Obstructing Navigation of the Hudson.&quot;

On May 8, 1777, Yates was appointed to the New York Supreme Court.

===Later years===
After the war ended, although principally an associate justice of the state Supreme Court, Yates maintained a modest legal practice and continued surveying as well. During the 1780s, his political star continued to rise in the &quot;party&quot; of Governor George Clinton as he spoke in opposition to the expansion of the scope of a national government. In 1787, he was appointed with John Lansing Jr. and Alexander Hamilton to represent New York at the Philadelphia Convention to revise the Articles of Confederation. Arriving in Philadelphia in May 1787, Yates and Lansing felt the mood of the convention to produce an entirely new form of government was beyond their authority. For this reason, Yates and Lansing departed the Convention in July 1787. In 2021, researchers discovered that Robert Yates attempted to return to the Convention, but arrived too late. En route from Albany to Philadelphia in September, Yates learned that the Convention had &quot;risen.&quot; It is likely that Yates attempted to return to Philadelphia to counteract Alexander Hamilton. In December 1787, Yates and John Lansing wrote a letter to Governor Clinton urging opposition to the new Constitution. Yates&#x27;s personal notes from the Philadelphia convention were published in 1821. Alexander Hamilton was the sole delegate from New York to sign the Constitution.

In 1788, Yates was elected as an anti-federalist delegate to the New York State ratifying convention at Poughkeepsie, and worked against adoption of the Constitution. Among the leading anti-federalists who attended the Poughkeepsie Convention, he was the most vocal delegate in support of protecting individual liberties. After the Poughkeepsie Convention ratified the Constitution with an accompanying request for amendments to protect individual liberties, Yates pledged his support as a matter of patriotic duty.

In 1789, he ran for governor against George Clinton with the support of the Anti-Federalists, who viewed him as a reasonable, potentially kindred spirit who was not from a wealthy family. He was defeated by Governor Clinton. Approached by the Federalists again in 1792, Yates refused to run citing the financial drain caused by past politicking. In the gubernatorial campaign of 1795, considerable sentiment existed for Yates&#x27;s candidacy as he was firmly established in the center of the former Anti-Federal party. John Jay defeated him in a close election, effectively ending Yates&#x27;s political career. By then, he already had devoted himself to the law.

In September 1790, Yates was chosen Chief Justice of the New York State Supreme Court. He served until the mandatory retirement age of sixty in 1798. Unlike many &quot;new men of the Revolution,&quot; he did not attain great wealth and retired to his middling Albany home.

==Personal life==
In 1765, he married Jannatte &quot;Jane&quot; Van Ness (1741–1818) and settled in Albany, New York. Jane was a sister of Judge Peter Van Ness of Kinderhook. Among her extended family was nephews John Peter Van Ness, William P. Van Ness, and Cornelius P. Van Ness. The couple had six children, including:

* John Van Ness Yates (1779–1839), who served as the Secretary of State of New York from 1818 to 1826.

He died in Albany, New York, on September 9, 1801, at age 63. He was originally buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Cemetery, and later reinterred at Albany Rural Cemetery.

<doc id="869292" wikidata="Q2365995" url="?curid=869292" title="Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve">
<text>Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve is a coastal state park in San Diego, California. The reserve is one of the wildest stretches of land on the Southern California coast, covering . It is bordered immediately to the south by Torrey Pines Golf Course and to the north by the city of Del Mar. The reserve was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1977.

The reserve consists of a plateau with cliffs that overlook Torrey Pines State Beach and a lagoon that is vital to migrating seabirds. Many different kinds of wildlife and flora are found within the reserve, including bobcat, fox, skunk, raccoon, coyote, rabbit, cacti, coastal chaparral, and the rare Torrey pine. During whale migration, it is possible to see several species from the cliffs, including humpback whale and gray whale.

The of trails within the park offer an attraction for hikers and beach-goers. A small museum sits at the top of the hill. From the cliffs and many places along the beach, it is possible to see La Jolla to the south and Del Mar to the north. At the southern end of the beach is a large rock that projects into the ocean, called Flat Rock. South of the rock is San Diego&#x27;s unofficial nude beach, Black&#x27;s Beach.

==Establishment==
The area is home to the Kumeyaay, Payómkawichum, Kuupiaxchem, and Cahuilla peoples. George Marston persuaded the San Diego City Council in 1899 to pass an ordinance preserving of the pueblo land as a park. Later between 1908 and 1911, newspaperwoman and philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps bought additional land and donated it to the city. In 1916, Guy Fleming visited the park and after examining the current condition, pushed for preservation of the park and eventually became the District Superintendent for the Southern California State Park System. The Torrey Pines Lodge was completed in 1923 and a year later, more lands were added to the park. Now consisting of over of cliffs, beach, and more, the park became open to the public.

In 1956, it was decided that the park be handed over to the State of California for higher protection because it is a state reserve. In 1970, and 1,500 trees were added due to fear of human expansion. Later in 1975, the Torrey Pines Docent Society was started to help promote preservation of the park, in addition to the Visitors Center. In 2007, the park&#x27;s name was changed to Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve. The park size is now over . The official Torrey Pines website provides more detail on the establishment of the Torrey Pines Reserve.

==Ecology==

===Torrey Pine===
The Pinus torreyana torreyana, also known as the Torrey pine, is the rarest pine in North America. The plant has vanished over time due to the drying period over the last 10 years and has an intricate root system that helps attach it to the overbearing bluffs. Torrey Pines is the sole location worldwide where this subspecies grows (including a small coastal strip immediately north of the Reserve in Del Mar. A closely related subspecies occurs on Santa Rosa Island.

=== Other species, climate ===
While chiefly known as habitat to this extremely rare and endangered species, the Torrey Pine Reserve also is home to a wide variety of vegetation and wildlife. The Torrey Pines Reserve has a rather unusual climate due to the Santa Ana winds causing the vegetation to be drier. Plants such as Coastal sage scrub, Coastal Strand, and Salt marsh also thrive at Torrey Pines. More information on the different plants that grow at this park is provided on the official Torrey Pines website. 

==Trails==
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve offers 8 trails to hikers that vary in terms of length, difficulty, and scenery. San Diego Tourism Authority says that three popular trails at the park are Guy Fleming Trail, Razor Point Trail, and Beach Trail. The Guy Fleming Trail is and is the easiest trail at the park. The trail provides diverse scenery from Peñasquitos Marsh to views of La Jolla and is well known for whale sightings in the winter. The Razor Point Trail is a loop that provides hikers with a view of ravines and badlands while overlooking the ocean. The Beach Trail is a walk that leads one down to Torrey Pines State Beach. Although it is the least scenic trail, it is very popular due to taking hikers straight to the wide-open beach. Other trails at the park are the Parry Grove Trail, Yucca Point Trail, High Point Trail, Broken Hill Trail, and Discovery Trail. The official Torrey Pines website provides more information on the other trails. 

==Accidents==
In 2008, a 57-year-old tourist from Henderson, Nevada died from a cliff that gave way. The man was struck on the head by basketball-sized boulders, and after the victim was dug out of the debris, a crew performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation to try to save his life. The man died hours later. Torrey Pines is known for its sandy, unstable cliffs and this was not the first time a cliff had collapsed. On January 18, 2014, a 65-year-old hiker fell about down a trail at Torrey Pines and broke his ankle. The injury was so drastic that the man needed a cliff rescue.

<doc id="869296" wikidata="Q560121" url="?curid=869296" title="Charles Lwanga">
<text>Charles Lwanga (Luganda: Kaloli Lwanga; 1 January 18603 June 1886) was a Ugandan convert to the Catholic Church who was martyred with a group of his peers and is revered as a saint by both the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion.

A member of the Baganda tribe, Lwanga was born in the Kingdom of Buganda, the central and southern part of modern Uganda, and served as chief of the royal pages and later major-domo in the court of King Mwanga II of Buganda. He was baptised by Pere Giraud on 15 November 1885.

In fear of losing the overbearing power he had on his subjects to a Christian worldview, King Mwanga II insisted that Christian converts abandon their new faith and executed many Anglicans and Catholics between 1885 and 1887, including Lwanga and other officials in the royal court.

==Martyrdom==

The persecution started after Mwanga ordered a massacre of Anglican missionaries, including Bishop James Hannington who was the leader of the Anglican community. Joseph Mukasa Balikuddembe, the Catholic servant of the court and a lay catechist, reproached the king for the killings, against which he had counseled him. Mwanga had Balikuddembe beheaded and arrested all of his followers on 15 November 1885. The king then ordered that Lwanga, who was chief page at that time, take up Balikuddembe&#x27;s duties. That same day, Lwanga and other pages under his protection sought baptism as Catholics by a missionary priest of the White Fathers; some hundred catechumens were baptized. Lwanga often protected boys in his charge from the king&#x27;s sexual advances.
On 25 May 1886, Mwanga ordered a general assembly of the court while they were settled at Munyonyo, where he condemned two of the pages to death. The following morning, Lwanga secretly baptized those of his charges who were still only catechumens. Later that day, the king called a court assembly in which he interrogated all present to see if any would renounce Christianity. Led by Lwanga, the royal pages declared their fidelity to their religion, upon which the king condemned them to death, directing that they be marched to the traditional place of execution. Three of the prisoners, Pontian Ngondwe, Athanasius Bazzekuketta, and Gonzaga Gonza, were murdered on the march there.

When preparations were completed and the day had come for the execution on 3 June 1886, Lwanga was separated from the others by the Guardian of the Sacred Flame for private execution, in keeping with custom. As he was being burnt, Lwanga said to the Guardian, &quot;It is as if you are pouring water on me. Please repent and become a Christian like me.&quot;

Twelve Catholic boys and men and nine Anglicans were then burnt alive. Another Catholic, Mbaga Tuzinde, was clubbed to death for refusing to renounce Christianity, and his body was thrown into the furnace to be burned along with those of Lwanga and the others. The fury of the king was particularly inflamed against the Christians because they adamantly refused to participate in sexual acts with him. As previously mentioned, Lwanga, in particular, had protected the pages. The executions were also motivated by Mwanga&#x27;s broader efforts to avoid foreign threats to his power. According to Assa Okoth, Mwanga&#x27;s overriding preoccupation was for the &quot;integrity of his kingdom&quot;, and perceived that men such as Lwanga were working with foreigners in &quot;poisoning the very roots of his kingdom&quot;. Not to have taken any action could have led to suggestions that he was a weak sovereign.

==Veneration==

Lwanga senior and the other Catholics who accompanied him in death were canonized on 18 October 1964 by Pope Paul VI during the Second Vatican Council. &quot;To honor these African saints, Paul VI became the first reigning pope to visit sub-Saharan Africa when he toured Uganda in July 1969, a visit that included a pilgrimage to the site of the martyrdom at Namugongo.&quot;

The Basilica of the Uganda Martyrs was built at the site of the executions and serves as their shrine. The Brothers of St. Charles Lwanga Senior (Luganda: Bannakaroli Brothers) were founded in 1927 as an indigenous religious congregation of Ugandan men committed to providing education to the disadvantaged youth of their country.

In the United States, Lwanga is honored by St. Charles Anglican Cathedral in the Diocese of Cascadia. In 2013, St. Cecilia Parish in Detroit, Michigan merged with St. Leo Parish and was renamed as St. Charles Lwanga Parish to represent the African American community in the inner-city of Detroit and continue Lwanga&#x27;s legacy.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Bagaza (29 August 19464 May 2016) was a Burundian army officer and politician who ruled Burundi as president and &quot;de facto&quot; military dictator from November 1976 to September 1987.

Born into the Tutsi ethnic group in 1946, Bagaza served in the Burundian military and rose through the ranks under the rule of Michel Micombero after his rise to power in 1966. Bagaza deposed Micombero in a bloodless coup d&#x27;état in 1976 and took power himself as head of the ruling Union for National Progress (, UPRONA). Despite having participated in the genocidal killings of 1972, he introduced various reforms which modernised the state and made concessions to the country&#x27;s ethnic Hutu majority. His regime became increasingly repressive after it became consolidated in 1984, especially targeting the powerful Catholic Church. His rule lasted until 1987 when his regime was overthrown in a further coup d&#x27;état and he was forced into exile. He returned to Burundi in 1994 and became involved in national politics as the leader of the Party for National Recovery (, PARENA). He died in 2016.

==Biography==
=== Early life and military career ===
Bagaza was born in Rutovu, Bururi Province in Belgian-ruled Ruanda-Urundi on 29 August 1946. His family were ethnic Hima, part of the wider Tutsi ethnic group. After studying in Catholic schools in Bujumbura, he enlisted in the army of the newly independent Kingdom of Burundi. He was sent to Belgium in 1966 where he studied at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels until 1971. He earned a sociology degree. He returned to Burundi in 1972. Bagaza was involved in President Michel Micombero&#x27;s genocidal killings of ethnic Hutu in 1972, though the &quot;extent or nature of his involvement&quot; remain unclear. In May he was, at the rank of captain, appointed adjunct chief of staff of the Burundian military in charge of logistics—largely because of his family&#x27;s connections to the Micombero, replacing purged Hutu officer Martin Ndayahoze. In November he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and made chief of the general staff. In May 1975 he was appointed to the Chamber of Accounts under the Supreme Court.

=== Dictatorship ===
Bagaza overthrew Micombero in a military coup on 1 November 1976. The constitution was temporarily suspended by a military junta, the 30-member Supreme Revolutionary Council, which declared Bagaza president on 10 November 1976. He was thirty at the time. Bagaza initiated a number of reforms after taking power, attacking corruption and making modest reforms to improve conditions for Hutus who had been targeted under the Micombero regime. He reformed taxation and the administration. He earned respect for his work ethic, as he &quot;drove himself to work at 7:30 a.m. each day&quot; instead of travelling in large cavalcades as most regional politicians did at the time. Some Hutu refugees were allowed to return from exile in Zaire and Tanzania where they had fled during the genocide. Bagaza granted a few government posts to Hutu, appointing two Hutu ministers in his first cabinet. Burundi&#x27;s feudal system of land tenure, known as the &quot;Ubugererwa&quot;, was abolished in 1977. Some Tutsi-held land was transferred to Hutu farmers. The end of the &quot;Ubugererwa&quot; as well as the abolition of the &quot;ikori&quot; poll tax earned Bagaza much goodwill among Hutus.

Officially, Bagaza attempted to address the country&#x27;s ethnic tensions by banning all mention of ethnicity, declaring that everyone was just Burundian or, more broadly, African. Researcher Nigel Watt argued that this move was just disguising the continued dominance of the Tutsi elite. Bagaza ensured that the Tutsi remained economically and politically dominant. In fact, the marginalization of Hutus in the economy and education increased during Bagaza&#x27;s rule. This resulted in the emergence of the radical PALIPEHUTU party and militant group.

Under Bagaza, a programme of economic modernization was begun to allow the emergence of small-scale capitalist agriculture, involving the construction of two new hydroelectric dams which still form the basis for Burundi&#x27;s energy infrastructure. He also initiated road building programs, expanded the availability of drinking water, and developed a port on Lake Tanganyika. His infrastructure investments helped to shape Burundi&#x27;s export ecenomy which came to rely on coffee, tea and sugar. Internationally, Bagaza successfully maneuvered between different political factions, securing economic aid from the Western Bloc, the Eastern Bloc, China, and the Arab world. He expelled the large Congolese migrant community from Burundi, claiming that they had just decided to leave on their own.

Bagaza&#x27;s regime introduced a new national constitution in 1981 which consolidated Burundi as a one-party dictatorship under the Union for National Progress (&quot;Union pour le Progrès national&quot;, UPRONA), which he re-organised under his own leadership. In the election of 1984, he was re-elected president with 99.6 percent of the national vote. After the election, Bagaza organized a military operation against the Catholic Church in Burundi, regarding it as a threat to his power. The Church was increasingly targeted as the regime became increasingly repressive. Foreign missionaries were expelled and attempts were made to break its influence over the public and education. Bagaza banned Catholic media and church services, closed Church-run literacy centers, nationalized Church-run schools, and ordered the arrest and torture of Church figures. He ordered the closure of 87 churches, including Gitega Cathedral. Protestant media was also targeted. He also tried to implement other &quot;eccentricities&quot; such as restricting bar openings and officially limiting the time as well as money Burundians were allowed to spend for traditional betrothal and mourning ceremonies. Bob Krueger argued that these policies ultimately alienated too many Burundians and led to Bagaza&#x27;s deposition, a view shared by Watt.

=== Deposition and involvement in democratic politics ===
A military coup broke out in September 1987, led by Major Pierre Buyoya, while Bagaza was abroad in Quebec, Canada. Buyoya successfully deposed Bagaza&#x27;s regime and established himself as president. Bagaza himself went into exile in neighbouring Uganda and later in Libya where he lived until 1993. Opposed to the empowerment of Hutu through the 1993 elections, he reportedly played a major part in the coup d&#x27;état against Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi&#x27;s first democratically elected president. The putschists killed Ndadaye, but failed to maintain control. Power was consequently returned to a civilian, democratic government. Bagaza subsequently denied any involvement in the putsch. Despite the coup&#x27;s failure, he returned to Burundi where he founded the Party for National Recovery (&quot;Parti pour le Redressement National&quot;, PARENA). PARENA was described as a Tutsi &quot;extremist party&quot;. He was a senator for life as a former head of state. At the time, Bagaza was known for his extreme views, including general opposition to any power-sharing agreements with Hutu factions such as the Front for Democracy in Burundi (&quot;Front pour la Démocratie au Burundi&quot;, FRODEBU). He eventually began to advocate the division of Burundi into a &quot;Tutsiland&quot; and a &quot;Hutuland&quot;.

On 18 January 1997, Bagaza was placed under house arrest for gathering weapons for a plot against President Buyoya. Two months later, the house arrest was changed into a prison sentence, though he was quickly released. Bagaza was subsequently involved in the peace talks which were supposed to end the Burundian Civil War. As he and PARENA as a whole tended to be opposed to the implementation of power-sharing deals with the Hutu rebels, the government placed Bagaza under house arrest and banned PARENA from November 2002 to May 2003. In 2005, there were rumours that radical followers of Bagaza were organising a rebel group known as &quot;Justice and Liberity United Front&quot;. Tensions abated when PARENA accepted ministerial position in the newly formed coalition government. Bagaza ran as PARENA&#x27;s candidate for the 2010 presidential election, but withdrew when the Burundian opposition boycotted the elections. He stepped down as head of PARENA in March 2014, and was succeeded by Zénon Nimbona. He remained the main opposition leader in the Burundian Senate, and joined the opposition boycott of the 2015 elections. When major unrest erupted in the country in the period leading up to the 2015 election, Bagaza and the other three still-living ex-presidents called for an international intervention.

Bagaza died in Brussels, Belgium on 4 May 2016 at the age of 69 of natural causes and was buried in Bujumbura on 17 May 2016. He was survived by his wife Fausta and four daughters.

<text>Flex Ltd. (previously known as Flextronics International Ltd. or Flextronics) is a Singapore-domiciled multinational manufacturing company. It is the third largest global electronics manufacturing services (EMS), original design manufacturer (ODM) company by revenue, behind only Pegatron for what concerns original equipment manufacturers. Flex&#x27;s U.S. corporate headquarters are located in Austin, Texas. The company has manufacturing operations in over 30 countries, totaling about 172,000 employees.

==History==

The company was founded in 1969 as Flextronics, Inc.

In 1990, the company was renamed Flextronics International, Ltd. and registered in Singapore. In 1993, the company received venture capital funding through Sequoia Capital, and became a publicly held company again in 1994. In 2000, the company ranked third on &quot;100 Best-Managed Companies&quot; by &quot;IndustryWeek&quot;. In 2006 Flextronics took over a part of the production of Lego, but in 2009 Lego decided to end relations with Flextronics and purchase the production facilities in Mexico and Hungary. On 4 June 2007, Flextronics offered to purchase Solectron for US$3.6 billion and thus making Solectron a subsidiary of Flextronics. The acquisition of Solectron was completed by end of October 2007, earlier than anticipated.

On 18 March 2009, Flextronics was invited to ring the NASDAQ stock market opening bell, signifying the day&#x27;s start of trading and celebrated 15-year NASDAQ-listed anniversary. Mike McNamara (then-CEO) and a group of top executives represented the company at the ringing of the bell. On 25 August 2009, Flextronics announced that it was chosen by LG Electronics (LGE), a global provider of advanced digital products and applied technologies, to manufacture 19, 22, 26, 32, and 37-inch LCD television receivers at its Ciudad Juárez, Mexico facility for distribution to the North and South American markets. On 2 September 2009, Flextronics announced that Multek received Danaher Test and Measurement&#x27;s 2009 Outstanding Supplier Award. The award was given based on quality, delivery performance, engineering support and cost for work with two of Danaher&#x27;s business units, Tektronix and Fluke.

On 15 September 2010, Flextronics announced that it had been chosen by Brammo, Inc., former producer of electric traction motors and traction batteries, to be its manufacturing partner for the production and distribution of plug-in electric motorcycles and components. In 2010, the company signed an agreement with Lenovo to provide manufacturing for Europe.

In 2012, Flextronics incubated Elementum, a start-up supply chain management (SCM) company based in Mountain View, California. In 2014, Elementum was spun off from Flextronics as its own separate entity.

In 2014, Flextronics was named as the manufacturer of the Fitbit Force by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission in the context of a complete recall of the product due to rashes developing on the wrists of its users.

In July 2015 the company announced it changed the company name from Flextronics to Flex.

In September 2015, Flex acquired Nextracker, one of the leading solar tracker companies, for $330 million.

In November 2015, Flex, acquired Wink smart home platform to bring the Intelligence of Things &quot;Home&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Breach of contracts===
Flextronics was sued in what was apparent in breach of contract with Beckman Coulter Inc., a maker of medical devices. The case dates from 1997, when Beckman Coulter entered into an agreement with Dovatron, a unit of the Dii Group, to provide circuit boards for a Beckman blood analyser. Flextronics acquired the Dii Group in 1999 and, according to Beckman, shortly thereafter Flextronics refused to provide the circuit boards unless it bought other electronic components from the company.

Beckman filed suit in early 2001, seeking $2.2 million in damages, which were cited as the costs incurred in having to retool one of its plants to manufacture the circuit boards in-house. At the end of the trial, Flextronics paid $23 million for the damages.

===Leak of USB charger confidential shipment data===
A former Flextronics executive pleaded guilty to committing wire fraud and security fraud by providing confidential information related to USB charger shipment data used for U.S. based iPhones and iPods in 2009.

===Seizure of Huawei goods over tariff war===
According to a 2019 report, Flex produced smartphone and 5G base stations for Huawei, and when the US added Huawei to its Entity List on May 16, Flex kept Huawei&#x27;s assets at its factory in Zhuhai. 

This included production equipment, raw materials, and half-made products worth approximately 700 million yuan ($101.85 million). These goods were held up for over a month, however Huawei was able to retrieve some of the goods worth 400 million yuan through third-party channels in June 2019.

<text>Győr ( , ; ; ) is the main city of northwest Hungary, the capital of Győr-Moson-Sopron County and Western Transdanubia region, and – halfway between Budapest and Vienna – situated on one of the important roads of Central Europe. It is the sixth largest city in Hungary, and one of its seven main regional centres. The city has county rights.

==History==
The area along the Danube River has been inhabited by varying cultures since ancient times. The first large settlement dates back to the 5th century BCE; the inhabitants were Celts. They called the town &quot;Ara Bona&quot; &quot;Good altar&quot;, later contracted to &quot;Arrabona&quot;, a name which was used until the eighth century. Its shortened form is still used as the German (&quot;Raab&quot;) and Slovak (&quot;Ráb&quot;) names of the city.

Roman merchants moved to Arrabona during the 1st century BCE. Around 10 CE, the Roman army occupied the northern part of Western Hungary, which they called &quot;Pannonia&quot;. Although the Roman Empire abandoned the area in the 4th century due to constant attacks by the tribes living to the east, the town remained inhabited.

Around 500 the territory was settled by Slavs, in 547 by the Lombards, and in 568–c. 800 by the Avars, at that time under Frankish and Slavic influence. During this time it was called &quot;Rabba&quot; and later &quot;Raab&quot;. Between 880 and 894, it was part of Great Moravia, and then briefly under East Frankish dominance.

The Magyars occupied the town around 900 and fortified the abandoned Roman fortress. Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, founded an episcopate there. The town received its Hungarian name &quot;Győr&quot;, which likely derives from Old Hungarian personal name Győr, who could be the county&#x27;s first count. The town was affected by all the trials and tribulations of the history of Hungary: it was occupied by Mongols during the Mongol invasion (1241–1242) and then was destroyed by the Czech army in 1271.

After the disastrous battle of Mohács, Baron Tamás Nádasdy and Count György Cseszneky occupied the town for King Ferdinand I while John Zápolya also was attempting to annex it. During the Ottoman occupation of present-day central and eastern Hungary (1541 - late 17th century), Győr&#x27;s commander Kristóf Lamberg thought it would be futile to try to defend the town from the Turkish army. He burned down the town and the Turkish forces found nothing but blackened ruins, hence the Turkish name for Győr, &quot;Yanık kale&quot; (&quot;burnt castle&quot;).

During rebuilding, the town was surrounded with a castle and a city wall designed by the leading Italian builders of the era. The town changed in character during these years, with many new buildings built in Renaissance style, but the main square and the grid of streets remained.

In 1594, after the death of Count János Cseszneky, captain of Hungarian footsoldiers, the Ottoman army occupied the castle and the town. In 1598 the Hungarian and Austrian army took control of it again and occupied it. During the Turkish occupation the city was called Yanık Kala (burned place, as a reference to the enormous damages caused by the siege).

In 1683, the Turks returned briefly, only to leave after being defeated in the Battle of Vienna.

During the following centuries, the town became prosperous. In 1743 Győr was elevated to free royal town status by Maria Theresa. The religious orders of Jesuits and Carmelites settled there, building schools, churches, a hospital, and a monastery.

On 14 June 1809, during the War of the Fifth Coalition, this was the site of the Battle of Győr (Battle of Raab), where the army of Eugène de Beauharnais defeated the Hungarian &quot;noble insurrection&quot; (militia) and an Austrian corps under the Archdukes Joseph and Johann. Napoleon&#x27;s forces occupied the castle and had some of its walls blown up. The leaders of the town soon realized that the old ramparts were not useful any more. Most of the ramparts were destroyed, allowing the town to expand.
In the mid-19th century, Győr&#x27;s role in trade grew as steamship traffic on the River Danube began. The town lost its importance in trade when the railway line between Budapest and Kanizsa superseded river traffic after 1861. The town leaders compensated for this loss with industrialisation. The town prospered until World War II when several buildings were destroyed. Some large-scale strategic bombing devastated industrial and residential areas as well as the airport. It was targeted because the Rába factory was a main tank (Turán) and aeroplane (Bf 109) producer. One of these raids destroyed some parts of the maternity hospital.

The 1950s and &#x27;60s brought more change: only big blocks of flats were built, and the old historical buildings were not given care or attention. In the 1970s the reconstruction of the city centre began; old buildings were restored and reconstructed. In 1989 Győr won the European award for the protection of monuments.

A 100-year-old Raba factory on the River Danube close to the historical centre is to be replaced by a new community called Városrét. The mixed-use community will have residential and commercial space as well as schools, clinics and parks.

The city&#x27;s main theatre is the National Theatre of Győr, finished in 1978. It features large ceramic ornaments made by Victor Vasarely.

The city has several historical buildings, for example the castle, and the Lutheran Evangelic church.

<text>A flophouse (American English) or doss-house (British English) is a place that has very low-cost lodging, providing space to sleep and minimal amenities.

==Characteristics==
Historically, flophouses, or British &quot;doss-houses&quot;, have been used for overnight lodging by those who needed the lowest-cost alternative to staying with others, shelters, or sleeping outside. Generally, rooms are small, bathrooms are shared, and bedding is minimal, sometimes with mattresses or mats on the floor, or canvas sheets stretched between two horizontal beams creating a series of hammock-like beds. 

People who make use of these places have often been called transients and have been between homes. Quarters are typically very small, and may resemble office cubicles more than a regular room in a hotel or an apartment building. Some flophouses qualify as boarding houses, but only if they offer meals. 

American flophouses date at least to the 19th century, but the term &quot;&quot; itself is only attested from around the early 1900s, originating in hobo slang. In the past, flophouses were sometimes called &quot;lodging houses&quot; or &quot;workingmen&#x27;s hotels&quot; and catered to hobos and transient workers such as seasonal railroad and agriculture workers, or migrant lumberjacks who would travel west during the summer to work and then return to an eastern or midwestern city which ran along the rail lines, such as Chicago, to stay in a flophouse during the winter. This is described in the 1930 novel &quot;The Rambling Kid&quot; by Charles Ashleigh and the 1976 book &quot;The Human Cougar&quot; by Lloyd Morain. Another theme in Morain&#x27;s book is the gentrification which was then beginning and which has led cities to pressure flophouses to close.

Some city districts with flophouses in abundance became well known in their own right, such as the Bowery in Manhattan, New York City. Since the middle 20th century, reforms there have gradually made flophouses scarcer. The resulting gentrification and higher real-estate value have further eroded the ability of flophouses and inexpensive boarding-style hotels to make a profit.

==21st-century revival==
In the 2010s, the high cost of housing in cities such as San Francisco saw an increase in the number of flophouses. The modern flophouses, sometimes marketed as co-living &quot;pods&quot;, usually have partitions between beds for privacy, and are created from existing houses or apartments. They are often marketed toward commuters who stay in the city during the workweek.

== Cage homes in Hong Kong==
Cage homes were built in colonial Hong Kong in the 1950s for single working men from Mainland China. Cage homes are described as &quot;wire mesh cages resembling rabbit hutches crammed into a dilapidated apartment.&quot; As of 2012, the number of impoverished residents in Hong Kong was estimated at 1.19 million, and cage homes, along with substandard housing such as cubicle apartments, were still serving a portion of this sector&#x27;s housing needs. The combination of high rents and income inequality has been given as one reason that cage homes persist.

Michael Adorjan, a University of Hong Kong criminology professor, has noted that &quot;The United Nations has called cage and cubicle homes an &#x27;insult to human dignity.&#x27;&quot;

== Cage hotels in the United States ==
Cage hotels, a form of single-room occupancy, were common in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century; an estimated 40,000 to 60,000 people lived in them during the winter. 

A 1958 survey by Christopher Jencks found that homeless men preferred cage hotels over shelters for reasons of privacy and security.

A similar preference for cage hotels over shelters was reported in turn of the century New York City, where single working men ranked their housing preference in the following order: 

&quot;Regulatory efforts to combat low-cost &#x27;cage hotels,&#x27; ... [has been] a driver of the expansion of the homeless population in US cities&quot;, according to Jencks. By 2021, only one, the Ewing Annex Hotel, remained in Chicago, housing some 200 men, many of whom would otherwise be homeless.

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-141 (; NATO reporting name &quot;Freestyle&quot;), also known as the Yak-41, is a Soviet supersonic vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft designed by Yakovlev. Intended as a replacement for the Yak-38, it was designed as a supersonic fleet defence fighter capable of STOVL/VTOL operating from Soviet carriers. Four prototypes were built before the project&#x27;s cancellation.

==Design and development==
Known internally as &quot;Product 48&quot;, the Yak-41 was intended to replace the Yak-38 in service with the Soviet Navy. It went through significant design evolution. Configurations studied by Yakovlev included a twin-engine configuration, which was rejected due to asymmetric thrust issues in the event of an engine failure during landing, and a single-engined configuration, with lift jets to allow for vertical takeoff and landing, was selected.
The engines were controlled digitally; manuverability during the hover was provided by reaction control jets, using excess airflow from the engines, located at the wingtips and under the nose. The pressurised cockpit was fitted with an automatic ejection seat; the automatic functionality would be armed when the engine duct was rotated past 30° when at an airspeed of less than . The prototypes had a cockpit arrangement similar to that of the Yak-38M; the production aircraft were planned to be fitted with an entirely new digital system including a helmet-mounted sight. The aircraft&#x27;s landing gear was of the tricycle type; the nosewheel retracted to the rear, the main wheels retracting forwards.
The wing was mounted high on the fuselage, and was foldable to allow for compact storage on board aircraft carriers. The main engine was a Tumansky R-79V-300, while the lift jets were a pair of Rybinsk (RKBM) RD-41s, installed at an angle of 85° in the forwards fuselage behind the cockpit.

Four prototypes were built; the first was a static-test article, the second a nonflying testbed, while the third and fourth prototypes would be used for flight testing

==Operational history==
The first flight took place on in 9 March 1987 at Zhukovsky; the aircraft first undertook hovering flight on 29 December 1989, with the first full transition from vertical to horizontal flight taking place on 13 June 1990. Trials on the mockup aircraft carrier deck at Saky began in April 1991. Results of the testing were considered satisfactory, with the aircraft&#x27;s combat manueverability regarded as excellent. Twelve world records were set during flight testing; as the aircraft&#x27;s designation of Yak-41 was considered classified, the records were declared as having been set by the &quot;Yak-141&quot;.
The first landing aboard the Russian aircraft carrier took place on 26 September 1991, using the second (first flying) prototype; the other flying prototype landed aboard an hour later. Eight flights from the ship were completed before 5 October, when following a hard landing a fuel tank ruptured, the aircraft catching fire and the pilot ejecting. The aircraft was later repaired for display. Later in October 1991 the program was suspended due to a lack of funds.

With the fall of the Soviet Union, Lockheed Aircraft entered a partnership with Yakovlev in 1991 for further development of the aircraft, now officially redesignated Yak-141; the partnership would not be announced by Yakovlev until 6 September 1992 and not confirmed by Lockheed until June 1994. The remaining intact protoype was displayed at the Farnborough Airshow in 1992. It was announced that the joint venture would result in the construction of three additional prototypes and an additional static test aircraft, one a two-seat trainer version, and all with an increase in their gross weight, however no additional aircraft were ever built.

<doc id="869317" wikidata="Q669435" url="?curid=869317" title="Renal agenesis">
<text>Renal agenesis is a medical condition in which one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) fetal kidneys fail to develop.

Unilateral and bilateral renal agenesis in humans, mice and zebra fish has been linked to mutations in the gene GREB1L. It has also been associated with mutations in the genes &quot;RET&quot; or &quot;UPK3A&quot; in humans and mice respectively.

==Type==
===Bilateral===

Bilateral renal agenesis (BRA) is a condition in which both kidneys of a fetus fail to develop during gestation. It is incompatible with life. It is one causative agent of Potter sequence. This absence of kidneys causes oligohydramnios, a deficiency of amniotic fluid in a pregnancy, which can place extra pressure on the developing baby and cause further malformations. The condition is frequently, but not always the result of a genetic disorder, and is more common in infants born to one or more parents with a malformed or absent kidney.

===Unilateral===
This is much more common, but is not usually of any major health consequence, as long as the single kidney is healthy. However, this kidney tends to be hypertrophied, ectopic and prone to infection and damage.

It may be associated with an increased incidence of Müllerian duct abnormalities, which are abnormalities of the development of the female reproductive tract and can be a cause of infertility, blocked menstrual flow (hematocolpos), increased need for Caesarean sections, or other problems. Herlyn–Werner–Wunderlich syndrome is one such syndrome in which unilateral renal agenesis is combined with a blind hemivagina and uterus didelphys. Up to 40% of women with a urogenital tract anomaly also have an associated renal tract anomaly.

Adults with unilateral renal agenesis have considerably higher chances of hypertension (high blood pressure). People with this condition are advised to approach contact sports with caution.

A possible complication later in life of unilateral renal agenesis is focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) which will cause nephrotic syndrome, potentially resulting from glomerular overload.

==Genetics==

In 2008 researchers found autosomal dominant mutations in the RET and GDNF genes to be linked to renal agenesis in unrelated stillborn fetuses through PCR and direct sequence analysis. In the study, DNA from 33 stillborn fetuses were sequenced for mutations in RET, GDNF and GFRA1. Nineteen of the fetuses had BRA, ten had URA and 4 had congenital renal dysplasia. Seven of the 19 BRA fetuses were found to have a mutation in the RET gene (37%), while two of the ten URA fetuses did (20%). One of the URA fetuses had two RET mutations and one GDNF mutation. There were no GFRA1 mutations found.

However, the results of Skinner et al. study were questioned by a more recent study with a larger number of cases. In this study 105 fetuses were analyzed. Sixty-five fetuses had BRA while 24 had URA with an abnormal contralateral kidney. Mutations in the RET gene were only found in seven of the fetuses (6.6%).

In 2014 researchers found autosomal recessive mutations in ITGA8 in three members of two unrelated families utilizing exome sequencing. One of the families was consanguineous.

In 2017 researchers identified heritable autosomal dominant mutations in the gene GREB1L in two unrelated families as being the cause of both BRA and URA utilizing Exome Sequencing and direct sequencing analysis. This is the first reported genetic lesion implicated in the activation of Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Targets that has been associated with renal agenesis in humans. The researchers found two different GREB1L mutations, each being unique to their respective pedigrees. In total, there were 23 individuals analyzed between the two families, four of which had BRA and five of which had URA. GREB1L mutations were identified in all of the affected individuals as well as in three unaffected family members, demonstrating incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.

There are several hundred to perhaps several thousand genes that, if they had the right kind of mutation, could lead to renal agenesis in humans. It is possible that each individual or family experiencing renal agenesis has a unique gene or genetic mutation causing the condition due to the fact that there are so many genes that are critical to proper renal development.

Chromosomal anomalies have been associated with BRA in certain cases (chromosomes 1, 2, 5 and 21), but these anomalies were not inherited and have not been observed in subsequent cases. Additionally, neither extreme substance abuse or environmental factors (high power line, mercury, ground water issues, etc.) have been reported to be linked to an increased incidence of BRA or other cause of Potter sequence. However, renal agenesis and other causes of oligohydramnios sequence have been linked to a number of other conditions and syndromes to include Down syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, branchio-oto-renal syndrome and others.

==Prevalence==
The prevalence of unilateral renal agenesis in the population is approximately 1 in about 1000 people. Bilateral agenesis occurs in 1 in about 2500 foetuses.

<text>The diaphysis (: diaphyses) is the main or midsection (shaft) of a long bone. It is made up of cortical bone and usually contains bone marrow and adipose tissue (fat).

It is a middle tubular part composed of compact bone which surrounds a central marrow cavity which contains red or yellow marrow. In diaphysis, primary ossification occurs.

Ewing sarcoma tends to occur at the diaphysis.

<text>The Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (ACAN or US-ACAN) is an advisory committee of the United States Board on Geographic Names responsible for recommending commemorative names for features in Antarctica.

==History==
The committee was established in 1943 as the Special Committee on Antarctic Names (SCAN). It became the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 1947. Fred G. Alberts was Secretary of the Committee from 1949 to 1980.

By 1959, a structured nomenclature was reached, allowing for further exploration, structured mapping of the region and a unique naming system. A 1990 ACAN gazeeter of Antarctica listed 16,000 names.

== Description ==
The United States does not recognise territorial boundaries within Antarctica, so ACAN assigns names to features anywhere within the continent, in consultation with other national nomenclature bodies where appropriate, as defined by the Antarctic Treaty System. The research and staff support for the ACAN is provided by the United States Geological Survey.

ACAN has a published policy on naming, based on priority of application, appropriateness, and the extent to which usage has become established. The United States Secretary of the Interior is in charge of formally appointing the members of the committee.

<text>Lord Kirkcudbright is a dormant title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created for Sir Robert Maclellan of Bombie on a 1633 royal visit to Scotland by King Charles I. Maclellan had already been created a baronet of Nova Scotia in 1631.

This MacLellan surname is said to have derived from &quot;Mac-a-ghille-dhiolan&quot; (son of the bastard). 

The MacLellan family was numerous in Galloway in the later half of the 14th Century and gave its name to Balmaclellan, MacLellan&#x27;s town, in the Stewartry of Galloway. It is understood that the Balmaclellan lands were given to John MacLellan by James III, king of Scotland, in 1466 on John MacLellan&#x27;s intention to provide a site for a church there abouts. By the beginning of the fifteenth century there were no fewer than fourteen knights of that name then living in Galloway.

Consequent upon, and sometime after the murder of Sir Patrick Maclellan by the 8th Earl of Douglas at his stronghold of Threave in 1452, family feuding without the King&#x27;s authority led to the forfeiture of the Maclellan Barony of Bomby, along with other collateral estates. Not long afterwards however in 1455 some Bombie lands were recovered, when King James II, of Scotland, with support from the Maclellans, undertook the siege of Threave Castle, and won a victory over the &#x27;Black Douglas&#x27; clan.

<text>Paul Allman Siple ( ; December 18, 1908 – November 25, 1968) was an American Antarctic explorer and geographer who took part in six Antarctic expeditions, including the two Byrd expeditions of 1928–1930 and 1933–1935, representing the Boy Scouts of America as an Eagle Scout. Siple was also a Sea Scout. His first and third books covered these adventures. With Charles F. Passel he developed the wind chill factor, a term coined by Siple.

==Biography==
Siple was born in Montpelier, Ohio on December 18, 1908, to Clyde Lavonius Siple and Fannie Hope Allman. His family moved to Erie, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Central High School in 1926. He became an Eagle Scout in 1923 with 59 merit badges. After an extensive nationwide search in 1928, he was the first Eagle Scout selected for an Antarctic expedition, sailing with Richard E. Byrd on his ship the &quot;City of New York&quot;. Siple appeared in the documentary film &quot;With Byrd at the South Pole&quot; (1930).

He became a brother of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity while attending Allegheny College, in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He married Ruth Ida Johannesmeyer on December 19, 1936.

He also attended Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, from which he received a Ph.D. in 1939. His dissertation was on &quot;Adaptations of the Explorer to the Climate of Antarctic&quot;. He worked in the Army Scientific Office for most of his career.

=== Career ===
Siple was involved with the United States Antarctic Service Expedition of 1939–1941, which would have been the third Byrd expedition. He served during Operation Highjump, (also known as the United States Navy Antarctic Developments Program 1946–1947), developed cold weather gear for the Korean War, and Operation Deep Freeze I in 1955–1956. He was the inaugural scientific leader at the U.S. Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station 1956–1957, during the International Geophysical Year. This activity is covered in his fourth book, &quot;90 Degrees South&quot;.

From 1963 to 1966 he served as the first U.S. science attaché to Australia and New Zealand, where he had a stroke in 1966 and returned to the United States.

== Death ==
He died on November 25, 1968, at the Army Research Center in Arlington, Virginia.

==Legacy==
Antarctic features Siple Coast, Siple Island, Mount Siple, Siple Ridge and Siple Station were named in his honor.

Siple is noteworthy because he is one of a very few individuals to participate in all five of the Antarctic expeditions conducted by Richard E. Byrd.

==Honors==
Siple received the Silver Buffalo Award from the BSA in 1947 and the Order of the Arrow National Distinguished Service Award in 1958. He received the Hubbard Medal from the National Geographic Society in 1958. In 1960 he was awarded the Hans Egede Medal by the Royal Danish Geographical Society. He also received the Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal, the Second Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal, United States Antarctic Expedition Medal and the Antarctica Service Medal.

<text>Villa Lante is a Mannerist garden of surprise in Bagnaia, Viterbo, central Italy, attributed to Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola.

Villa Lante did not become well known until it passed to Ippolito Lante Montefeltro della Rovere, Duke of Bomarzo, in the 17th century, when it was already 100 years old.
 The Villa, a property of the Republic of Italy, since December 2014, is run by the Polo Museale del Lazio.

==Architectural design==
The Villa Lante is formed by two &quot;casini&quot; (houses), nearly identical but built by different owners in a period separated by 30 years. Each square building has a ground floor of rusticated arcades or loggias which support a piano nobile above. Each facade on this floor has just three windows, alternating round or pointed pediments. Each window is divided by pilasters in pairs. An upper floor is merely hinted at by small rectangular, mezzanine type, windows above those of the piano nobile. Each casino is then crowned by a lantern in the summit of the pantiled roof. These elaborate square lanterns too have pilasters, and windows both real and blind.

Each of these casini, in their severe Mannerist style, was built by a different unrelated owner. Villa Lante was first commissioned by Cardinal Gianfrancesco Gambara who gives his surname to the first casino.

It appears that work commenced in the late 1560s on the right-hand (as one enters) casino. The area selected for the development was an existing walled hunting ground, known as &quot;barco&quot;. It is thought that Gambara commissioned Vignola to design the project (the villa is only attributed to Vignola), and begin the work and the design of the gardens for which the villa was to become famous. The first casino and upper garden were quickly completed, but work was then suspended for the remainder of Gambara&#x27;s lifetime.

Gambara died in 1587 and was succeeded as Apostolic Administrator of Viterbo by the 17-year-old nephew of Pope Sixtus V, Cardinal Alessandro Peretti di Montalto. It was this mere youth who completed the project at Bagnaia and built the second casino. The two casini differ most in their frescoes: frescoes of landscapes in the Gambara and in the Montalto frescoes by a later artist in a more classical style. In the Gambara Casino the vaulted frescoed loggias are a riot of colour highlighting the architectural detail, while in the Montalto Casino the principal reception room is a combination of fresco and plaster sculpture, almost &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;.

==Garden design==

The gardens of the Villa Lante feature cascades, fountains and dripping grottoes. The visual and harmonious choreography of water and the mechanical perfection of its flow was only achieved after Tommaso Ghinucci, a hydraulics engineer and architect from Siena, was called in; it is thought that his role was to oversee the hydraulics and building work. Although the renowned antiquarian and architect Pirro Ligorio was also consulted, it seems likely that the success of the water features is due to Ghinucci&#x27;s expertise which ensured that water flows through the gardens to this day.
The &quot;Quadrato&quot; is a perfectly square parterre. The twin casini stand on one side, on the remaining three sides the garden is enclosed by high box hedges. In the centre, low box is sculpted and formed into decorative patterns around small fountains and sculptures. The main feature of this parterre is the complex fountain at its centre, formed of four basins, separated by parapeted walks, the parapets decorated with stone pineapples and urns that intersect the water. At the heart of the complex, a centre basin contains the &quot;Fontana dei Mori&quot; by Giambologna: four life-sized moors stand square around two lions; they hold high the heraldic mountain surmounted by the star shaped fountain jet, the Montalto coat of arms. This is the focal point of this unusual composition of Casini and parterre.

In the first of the ascending terraces, lodged between two stone staircases, is the &quot;Fontana dei Lumini&quot; (&quot;Fountain of the Lamps&quot;), a circular tiered fountain; on the ledge of each tier, smaller fountains, imitating Roman oil lamps, spout small jets of water which in the sunlight appear to blaze like lamp flames. Camellias, and other ericaceous flowering shrubs added in the 19th century blaze in the shade of this terrace.

On the next (third) terrace is a large and long stone table, with a central channel with water flowing to keep the wine cool. At the back of this terrace, are large sculpted river gods flanking a fountain. Directly above and supplying the water for the fountain is the &quot;catena d&#x27;acqua&quot; or chain of water, a water feature (&quot;gioco d&#x27;acqua&quot;) that can be seen in other 16th-century gardens (such as the Villa Farnese and Villa d&#x27;Este); this rill of small basins allows the water to ripple down to arrive at the fountain between the sculpted crayfish claws, a reference to Cardinal Gambero&#x27;s heraldic device. In the meantime, stairs flanking the &quot;catena d&#x27;acqua&quot; lead up to the next terrace. 

On the next upper terrace are yet further fountains and grottos and two small casini called the Houses of the Muses, the sides of which frame the large Fountain of the Deluge that terminates the main axis of the garden. A roughened texture has been given to the sides of these small buildings to harmonise with the natural rough rock of the Fountain, and water conduits set in their eaves (and operated by a remote switch) project jets of water to complete a visual ensemble known as the &#x27;theatre of the waters&#x27;. The main facades of these small casini, like their grander relations on the lower terrace, feature Serliana loggias articulated by Ionic columns, suggesting they might have been designed by Vignola. They bear the name of Cardinal Gambara engraved on the cornices. One casino gives access to a small secret garden, a garden of hedges and topiary, with a line of columns creating an air of an almost melancholic nature.

A perspective plan of 1609 shows a wooded area of walks and vistas to obelisks, plus a maze which has since disappeared.

==Twentieth century==
Following the demise of Lante&#x27;s last cardinal owner in 1656, the villa passed to the family of Duke Ippolito Lante, in whose family it remained for many generations. In the 19th century the family, revived by an American heiress Duchess, (a daughter of Thomas Davies of New York) still lived at Lante in some style: the Gambara Casino was lived in by the ducal family and the Montalto was reserved for their guests.

In 1944 the gardens and casini were heavily damaged by Allied bombing after the fall of Rome. In the late 20th century the Villa was acquired by Dr. Angelo Cantoni, who completed a long program of restoration. It is now part of the Grandi Giardini Italiani.

<text>, meaning &quot;art of the spear&quot;, is the Japanese martial art of fighting with a .

==Origins==
Although the spear had a profound role in early Japanese mythology, where the islands of Japan themselves were said to be created by salt water dripping from the tip of the spear Ame-no-Nuhoko (Heavenly jeweled spear), as a weapon the first spear prototypes were brought from mainland Asia. These early versions were not seen as suitable by the Japanese, who later redesigned them once technology permitted.

==Use and popularity==
The Yari was a popular weapon throughout the feudal period of Japan, being cheaper to produce and requiring less training than other contemporary battlefield weapons, and lending itself to close formations of ashigaru troops, in conjunction with firearms upon their adoption in Japan. The height of sōjutsu&#x27;s popularity was immediately after the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, who themselves used spearmen in great numbers.

The Japanese ultimately modified the heads of their spears into a number of different variations, leading to the use of the spear both on foot and from horseback, and for slashing as well as the primary use of attacking with thrusts.

==Modern practice==
Sōjutsu is typically only a single component of curriculum in comprehensive traditional (&quot;koryū&quot;) schools. The still extant Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū claims to be the first school to include sōjutsu in its formal curriculum, and another very well known school of sōjutsu is the Hōzōin-ryū. While today there are very few schools still teaching sōjutsu, at one time there were as many as 450.

<doc id="869353" wikidata="Q895133" url="?curid=869353" title="Bounce message">
<text>A bounce message or just &quot;bounce&quot; is an automated message from an email system, informing the sender of a previous message that the message has not been delivered (or some other delivery problem occurred). The original message is said to have &quot;bounced&quot;.

This feedback may be immediate (some of the causes described here) or, if the sending system can retry, may arrive days later after these retries end.

More formal terms for bounce message include &quot;Non-Delivery Report&quot; or &quot;Non-Delivery Receipt&quot; (NDR), [Failed] &quot;Delivery Status Notification&quot; (DSN) message, or a &quot;Non-Delivery Notification&quot; (NDN).

== Classification == 
Although the SMTP is a mature technology, counting more than thirty years, its architecture is increasingly strained by both normal and unsolicited load. The email systems have been enhanced with reputation systems tied to the actual sender of the email, with the idea of recipient&#x27;s email servers rejecting the email when a forged sender is used in the protocol. 

Therefore, two types of email bounces have been created: &quot;hard bounces&quot; and &quot;soft bounces&quot;. Both of them affect the IP reputation of the sender because the Email Service Providers (ESPs) consider the total bounce rate as a decision factor when directing the email into a user&#x27;s Inbox. Briefly, the total bounce rate is calculated as the sum of the hard bounce rate and soft bounce rate. 

=== Hard bounces ===
Hard bounces are permanent and they score higher in terms of sender&#x27;s IP damage. Hard bounces occur when the sender&#x27;s mail server determines that there is a high likelihood that the recipient is unavailable and is likely to remain so. A few of the occasions when hard bounces occur are when the recipients of the email find themselves in one of the following situations: incorrect identifier/incorrect domain (such as a typo in the email address or in the domain) or their server does not accept emails anymore. In this case, removal of the email addresses that bounce back is mandatory.

=== Soft bounces === 
Soft bounces are temporary. A bounced message that experiences a soft bounce may be tried to be redelivered at another time. Soft bounces happen when the recipient of the email has either a full Inbox and therefore no space to store another email is available, or a limit on the size of the emails that it is allowed to receive has been reached. Additional situations in which a soft bounce appears is a block set up on the recipient&#x27;s email to mark a certain sender as a &#x27;spam&#x27; sender, or to blacklist a certain sender. Moreover, a temporary suspension of the recipient&#x27;s email or a temporary error on the server are also causes of a soft bounce.

== Delivery errors ==
Errors may occur at multiple places in mail delivery. A sender may sometimes receive a bounce message from their &quot;own&quot; mail server, reporting that it has been unable to send a message, or alternatively from a &quot;recipient&#x27;s&quot; mail server reporting that although it had accepted the message, it is unable to deliver it to the specified user. When a server accepts a message for delivery, it is also accepting the responsibility to deliver a bounce message in the event that delivery fails. 

=== Bounce due to lack of disk space ===
When an e-mail arrives at the destination server for an address (such as mymail.example, when sending to &quot;alice@mymail.example&quot;), it may be that the mail daemon is unable to deposit the message in the specified user&#x27;s mailbox if the underlying hard drive of the server has insufficient space.

=== Bounce due to unreachable destination ===
When sending an e-mail, the service from which the e-mail is sent may be unable to reach the destination address. In such case, the sender would receive a bounce message from their own mail server. Common causes for mail servers being unable to reach a destination:

* Unable to resolve the destination address. For example, if the domain name does not exist.
* Unable to establish a connection with the destination address. For example, if the IP address is not assigned to a server, or if the server is offline.

=== Bounce from forged message ===
Users may receive erroneous bounce messages about messages they never actually sent. This can happen in particular in the context of email spam or email viruses, where a spammer (sender) may forge a message to another user (intended recipient of spam), and forges the message to appear from yet another user (a third party). If the message cannot be delivered to the intended recipient, then the bounce message would be &quot;returned&quot; to the third party instead of the spammer. This is called backscatter.

=== Other causes ===
Had the &quot;library.example&quot; mail server known that the message would be undeliverable (for instance, if Jill had no user account there) then it would &quot;not&quot; have accepted the message in the first place, and therefore would not have sent the bounce. Instead, it would have rejected the message with an SMTP error code. This would leave &quot;Jack&#x27;s&quot; mail server (at &quot;store.example&quot;) the obligation to create and deliver a bounce.

=== Terminology ===
Bounces are a special form of autoresponder. Auto-responses (automatic replies) are mails sent by a program—as opposed to a human user—in reply to a received mail and sent to the bounce address.

Examples of other auto replies are vacation mails, challenges from challenge-response spam filtering, replies from list servers, and feedback reports. These other auto replies are discussed in RFC 3834: auto replies should be sent to the codice_1 stated in the received mail which has triggered the auto reply, and this response is typically sent with an empty Return-Path; otherwise auto responders could be trapped in sending auto replies back and forth.

The codice_1 is visible in delivered mail as header field codice_1 inserted by the SMTP mail delivery agent (MDA) (which is usually combined with a mail transfer agent, or MTA). The MDA simply copies the reverse path in the SMTP codice_4 command into the codice_1. The MDA also removes bogus codice_1 header fields inserted by other MTAs; this header field is generally guaranteed to reflect the last reverse path seen in the codice_4 command.

Today these paths are normally reduced to ordinary email addresses, as the old SMTP &#x27;source routing&#x27; was deprecated in 1989; for some historical background info see Sender Rewriting Scheme. One special form of a path still exists: the empty path codice_8, used for many auto replies and especially all bounces.

In a strict sense, bounces sent with a non-empty codice_1 are incorrect. RFC 3834 offers some heuristics to identify incorrect bounces based on the local part (left hand side before the &quot;@&quot;) of the address in a non-empty codice_1, and it even defines a mail header field, codice_11, to identify auto replies. But the mail header is a part of the mail data (SMTP command codice_12), and MTAs typically don&#x27;t look &quot;into&quot; the mail. They deal with the &quot;envelope&quot;, that includes the codice_4 address (a.k.a. codice_1, codice_15, or &quot;reverse path&quot;) but not, e.g., the RFC 2822-codice_16 in the mail header field codice_16. These details are important for schemes like BATV.

The remaining bounces with an empty codice_1 are non-delivery reports (NDRs) or delivery status notifications (DSNs). DSNs can be explicitly solicited with an SMTP Service Extension, however it is not widely used. Explicit requests for delivery failure details is much more commonly implemented with variable envelope return path (VERP), while explicit requests for them are rarely implemented.

NDRs are a basic SMTP function. As soon as an MTA has accepted a mail for forwarding or delivery it cannot silently delete (&quot;drop&quot;) it; it has to create and send a bounce message to the &quot;originator&quot; if forwarding or delivery failed.

==== Bouncing vs. rejecting ====
Excluding MDAs, all MTAs forward mails to another MTA. This next MTA is free to &quot;reject&quot; the mail with an SMTP error message like &quot;user unknown&quot;, &quot;over quota&quot;, etc. At this point the sending MTA has to &quot;bounce the message&quot;, i.e. inform its originator. A bounce may arise also without a rejecting MTA, or as RFC 5321 puts it:

&quot;&quot;If an SMTP server has accepted the task of relaying the mail and later finds that the destination is incorrect or that the mail cannot be delivered for some other reason, then it MUST construct an &quot;undeliverable mail&quot; notification message and send it to the originator of the undeliverable mail (as indicated by the reverse-path).&quot;&quot;

This rule is essential for SMTP: as the name says, it&#x27;s a &#x27;simple&#x27; protocol, it cannot reliably work if mail silently vanishes in black holes, so bounces are required to spot and fix problems.

==== Silently dropping messages ====
Today, however, it can be common to receive mostly spam emails, which usually uses forged codice_1s. It is then often impossible for the MTA to inform the originator, and sending a bounce to the forged codice_1 would hit an innocent third party. In addition, there are specific reasons why it is preferable to silently &quot;drop&quot; a message rather than &quot;reject&quot; it (let alone &quot;bounce&quot; it):

* Heuristically filtered spam. Spam filters are not perfect. Rejecting spam based on content filtering implies giving to spammers a test environment where they can try several alternatives until they find content that passes the filter.
* Viruses and worms. Most times these are sent automatically from an infected machine. Since a bounce may contain a copy of the worm itself, it may contribute to its diffusion.

Quoting again RFC 5321, section 6.2:

&quot;As discussed in Section 7.8 and Section 7.9 below, dropping mail without notification of the sender is permitted in practice. However, it is extremely dangerous and violates a long tradition and community expectations that mail is either delivered or returned. If silent message-dropping is misused, it could easily undermine confidence in the reliability of the Internet&#x27;s mail systems. So silent dropping of messages should be considered only in those cases where there is very high confidence that the messages are seriously fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate.&quot;

Not validating the sender is an inherent flaw in today&#x27;s SMTP, which is without the deprecated source routes mentioned earlier. This is addressed by various proposals, most directly by BATV and SPF.

== Causes of a bounce message ==
There are many reasons why an email may bounce. One reason is if the recipient address is misspelled, or simply does not exist on the receiving system. This is a &quot;user unknown&quot; condition. Other reasons include resource exhaustion — such as a full disk — or the rejection of the message due to spam filters. In addition, there are MUAs that allow users to &quot;bounce&quot; a message on demand. These user-initiated bounces are bogus bounces; by definition, a real bounce is automated, and is emitted by a MTA or MDA. 

Bounce messages in SMTP are sent with the envelope sender address codice_21, known as the &quot;null sender address&quot;. They are frequently sent with a codice_22 header address of codice_23 at the recipient site.

Typically, a bounce message will contain several pieces of information to help the original sender in understanding the reason their message was not delivered:

* The date and time the message was bounced,
* The identity of the mail server that bounced it,
* The reason that it was bounced (e.g. &quot;user unknown&quot; or &quot;mailbox full&quot;),
* The headers of the bounced message, and
* Some or all of the content of the bounced message.

RFC 3463 describes the codes used to indicate the bounce reason. Common codes are 5.1.1 (Unknown user), 5.2.2 (Mailbox full) and 5.7.1 (Rejected by security policy/mail filter).

== Format ==
 The format for the reporting of administrative messages is defined by . A DSN may be a MIME &quot;multipart/report&quot; message composed of three parts:
# a human readable explanation;
# a machine parsable &quot;message/delivery-status&quot;, a list of &quot;name: type; value&quot; lines that state several possible fields; and
# the original message, or a portion thereof, as an entity of type &quot;message/rfc822&quot;.

The second part of a DSN is also quite readable. It is essential to understand which MTA played which role. The &quot;Reporting-MTA&quot; is responsible for composing and sending the DSN.

When a &quot;Remote-MTA&quot; rejects a message during an SMTP transaction, a field &quot;Diagnostic-Code&quot; of type &quot;smtp&quot; may be used to report that value. Note that beside the numerical 3-digit value, the SMTP response contains itself a human readable part. The information

Remote-MTA: dns; smtp.store.example [192.0.2.3]
Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 550 No such user here

:is sometimes reported as, e.g.,

<text>Bronson Anthony Arroyo (born February 24, 1977) is an American former professional baseball pitcher and musician. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates between 2000 and 2002, the Boston Red Sox from 2003 to 2005, the Cincinnati Reds from 2006 to 2013, the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2014, and the Reds again in 2017. He won the 2004 World Series with Boston.

==Early life==
Arroyo was born February 24, 1977, in Key West, Florida, to parents Gus and Julie. Arroyo&#x27;s father is originally from Cuba. Arroyo later moved from Key West, Florida, to Brooksville, Florida, where he attended Hernando High School. At Hernando, he was named to the Class 4A all-state first team in 1995. At 13 years old, Arroyo was PONY teammates with A. J. Pierzynski. As of 2004, Arroyo was third all-time in scoring for Hernando&#x27;s basketball team. He signed a letter of intent to play college baseball as a pitcher at South Florida, turning down offers from Georgia Tech and Georgia Southern.

==Career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates===
The Pittsburgh Pirates selected Arroyo in the third round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft. Arroyo made his major league debut with Pittsburgh on June 12, 2000. During his rookie season in 2000, Arroyo was 2–6 with a 6.40 earned run average (ERA) in 20 appearances (12 starts). Playing 24 games (13 started) in 2001, Arroyo compiled a 5–7 record and a 5.09 ERA. Limited in playing time due to injuries and time in the minors, Arroyo played nine games (four started) in 2002 going 2–1 with a 4.00 ERA.

===Boston Red Sox===
Before the 2003 season, the Boston Red Sox claimed Arroyo from the Pirates off of waivers. Pitching for the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League, Arroyo pitched the fourth nine-inning perfect game in the 121-year history of the International League on August 10, 2003. He struck out nine, and went to a three-ball count to just three hitters all game long. He made 6 appearances in the majors with his first career save and a 2.08 ERA.

====2004====
Arroyo improved in 2004, jumping from middle relief to be the Red Sox No. 5 starter. On July 24, 2004, Arroyo hit Alex Rodriguez with a pitch, which led to a bench-clearing brawl. He compiled a 10–9 mark with a 4.03 ERA in innings, while posting a respectable 3.02 strikeout-to-walk ratio (142-to-47). He led the majors with hitting batsmen with pitches, totaling 20 hit by pitches. Arroyo also got his first and only championship title when the Red Sox won the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Arroyo made two starts and four relief appearances in the postseason, compiling a 0–0 record with two holds and a 7.82 ERA for the 2004 World Series champion Red Sox. A memorable and controversial play occurred involving Arroyo during Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, when Alex Rodriguez knocked away the ball from Arroyo&#x27;s glove while he attempted to apply a tag. The umpires reversed the ruling that Rodriguez was safe, forcing Derek Jeter to return to first base and calling Rodriguez out on the play for runner interference.

====2005====
Arroyo&#x27;s most productive season came in 2005, when he posted career highs up to that time in wins (14), starts (32), innings (205.1) and pitching appearances (35). He also excelled at holding runners, as he only gave up five stolen bases. Before the 2006 season, Arroyo signed a three-year, $11.25 million contract with the Red Sox. Arroyo said the deal was a &quot;hometown discount&quot; and agreed to the terms against the advice of his agent.

===Cincinnati Reds===
====2006====

During spring training before the 2006 season, the Red Sox traded Arroyo to the Cincinnati Reds for outfielder Wily Mo Peña. 2006 was a high point in Arroyo&#x27;s career. Highlights of the season included a league-leading innings pitched, a selection to the All-Star game, as well as his first career shutout in the major leagues. He finished 2006 with a 14–11 record and an ERA of 3.29.

====2007====
In February 2007, Arroyo signed a contract extension with the Cincinnati Reds which kept him with the organization through the 2010 season, with an option for the year 2011. He finished the 2007 season 9-15 and a 4.23 ERA.

====2008====
Arroyo pitched exactly 200 innings in 2008 by going 15–11 with a 4.77 ERA. During the season, Arroyo gave up 6 or more runs in a game 7 times in 34 starts including a game on June 24 against the Toronto Blue Jays where he gave up 11 earned runs in 1 inning of work (he pitched into the second inning without recording an out).

====2009====
Arroyo was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in his pitching hand during the 2008–09 offseason. As a result, he missed games during the 2009 spring training, as well as being advised to stop playing guitar until the symptoms disappeared. After a sub-par first half of the 2009 season, Arroyo turned in an excellent second half, lowering his ERA from the 5&#x27;s to the 3&#x27;s, throwing multiple shutouts and complete games, and putting himself in position to be the Reds top starter in 2010 since Edinson Vólquez, the #1 starter in 2009, was out for the start of the season following Tommy John surgery. Arroyo finished the 2009 year with 2 shutouts, a 15–13 record, and a 3.84 ERA.

====2010====
In 2010, Arroyo was chosen as the #2 starter in the Reds&#x27; first playoff series in 15 years. He pitched innings against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing one earned run and leaving with the lead. However, he would earn a no-decision as the Reds went on to lose the game. Arroyo won his first Gold Glove on November 10, 2010, the first by a Reds pitcher since Harvey Haddix in 1958. He finished the 2010 year 17-10 and a 3.88 ERA.

====2011====
The Reds exercised the 2011 option on Arroyo&#x27;s contract on November 3, 2010. After exercising his option, the Reds and Arroyo agreed on a three-year, $35 million contract extension, keeping him with the team through 2013. On March 26, 2011, Arroyo was diagnosed with mononucleosis, a condition where there is a high lymphocytes count in the blood from an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Arroyo finished the 2011 season 9-12 and a 5.07 ERA. He led the Majors with home runs allowed as he surrendered a total of 46 home runs.

====2012====
Arroyo finished the 2012 season by going 12–10 with a 3.74 ERA. Arroyo was chosen by Reds&#x27; manager Dusty Baker to start Game 2 of the 2012 National League Division Series versus the San Francisco Giants. He took a perfect game into the fifth inning, and allowed only two base-runners (a base hit with two outs in the fifth, and a walk in the seventh) in seven scoreless innings. The Reds won the game 9–0 to take a 2–0 series lead. The win was Arroyo&#x27;s first in thirteen postseason appearances, including five starts.

====2013====
Arroyo finished the 2013 season with an ERA of 3.79 and a win–loss record of 14–12. He also was the league leader in home runs allowed, giving up 32 long balls. Although the numbers paint a picture of a subpar pitching year, Arroyo managed to throw one shutout and two complete games in his age 36 season. In the offseason Arroyo elected to test free agency.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
====2014====
On February 7, 2014, the Diamondbacks agreed to terms with Arroyo on a 2-year contract with $23.5 million guaranteed.

On June 16, Arroyo was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career, after leaving a start early against the Dodgers with an elbow injury. It was announced on July 7 that Arroyo would be undergoing Tommy John surgery to repair a torn UCL, forcing him out for the remainder of the 2014 season. In 14 starts of the 2014 year, he went 7–4 with a 4.08 ERA.

====2015====
Arroyo did not make an appearance during the 2015 season, continuing his recovery from Tommy John surgery.

===Atlanta Braves / Los Angeles Dodgers===
On June 20, 2015, Arroyo, along with Touki Toussaint, was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Phil Gosselin.

On July 30, 2015, in a three-team trade, the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired Arroyo, Mat Latos, Michael Morse, Alex Wood, Jim Johnson, Luis Avilán, and José Peraza, while the Miami Marlins acquired minor league pitchers Victor Araujo, Jeff Brigham, and Kevin Guzman, and the Braves received Héctor Olivera, Paco Rodriguez, minor league pitcher Zachary Bird and a competitive balance draft pick for the 2016 MLB draft. He did not appear in any games in 2015 for any team and the Dodgers declined his 2016 option, making him a free agent.

===Washington Nationals===
====2016====
On January 26, 2016, Arroyo signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals that included an invitation to major league spring training. He pitched only 9 innings in the organization, in the Gulf Coast League, and was shut down due to elbow soreness. 
On October 11, 2016, Arroyo was released.

===Second stint with the Reds===
====2017====
Arroyo revealed that his previous elbow problems have been relieved by stem-cell injections he received in August. On February 2, 2017, Arroyo signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds that included an invitation to spring training. On June 19, Arroyo was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right shoulder injury, and he admitted that he was contemplating retirement, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t see myself ponying it up next year.&quot; Arroyo declined the opportunity to pitch one inning in September to close out his career, as he wanted to give a chance to a younger pitcher. On September 23, the Reds honored Arroyo with &quot;Kickin&#x27; it With Bronson&quot; night. Prior to the game, a ceremony was held with video tributes from manager Bryan Price and singer Eddie Vedder. After the game, Arroyo held a concert on the field, performing Pearl Jam covers with his band. Arroyo ended the season with a 3–6 record and 7.35 ERA in 14 starts. On September 24, he officially announced his retirement.

==Possible use of performance-enhancing drugs==
A day after reports claimed former Red Sox teammate David Ortiz was among 104 Major League players to have failed drug tests in 2003, Arroyo revealed he had used androstenedione and amphetamines in his career. Arroyo remarked that he would not be surprised if he was among the 104 players that failed tests, as he suspected the androstenedione he was taking may have been tainted with steroids.

His name was not among those revealed in the Mitchell Report.

==Pitching style==
Arroyo&#x27;s fastball was in the 85–89 miles per hour range. While this is considered below average speed among major league pitchers, his fastball had excellent movement and Arroyo was adept at &quot;spotting&quot; it. He also threw a hard slider that moved away from right-handed batters, and a straight changeup as well. Arroyo&#x27;s best pitch was his curveball, which he threw from multiple arm angles and was known to throw it in any count. The angle of the curveball itself could vary from a straight 12–6 to a sweeping 1–7. Arroyo&#x27;s delivery was somewhat unusual; he incorporated a large leg kick in his pitching motion, extending his front leg completely straight and lifting it up to a level above his waist before delivering the ball. His kick often appeared to reach head level and deceives hitters with its exaggerated motion. From the stretch position with runners on base, his leg-kick was much less pronounced and his delivery to home plate was very quick by major league standards. As a result, Arroyo was one of the better pitchers at holding runners on base.

==Music==

In 2005, Bronson Arroyo released his debut album, &quot;Covering the Bases&quot;. It included covers from bands such as Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, Foo Fighters and Incubus. The album also includes the Red Sox victory song &quot;Dirty Water&quot; by The Standells, in which Arroyo is accompanied by Johnny Damon, Lenny DiNardo, and Kevin Youkilis. He also taught Kevin Millar how to play guitar and performed vocals for the song &quot;Tessie&quot; as covered by the Dropkick Murphys.

In 2008, commercials for JTM Food Group featuring a &#x27;music video&#x27; by Arroyo; also featuring FSN Ohio color analyst and former Cincinnati Reds player Chris Welsh began airing during Cincinnati Reds games.

Arroyo appears as a vocalist on the song &quot;Since You&quot; on Chad Perrone&#x27;s album, &quot;Wake&quot;.

Bronson made his public debut on stage in January 2004 at the Hot Stove Cool Music fundraiser at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston. He performed a cover of Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Black&quot; with teammate Kevin Millar. He later performed full sets at four other Hot Stove Cool Music events with a full band that featured saxophonist Elan Trotman and two members of Gnarls Barkley (drummer Eric Gardner and guitarist Clint Walsh).

In July 2020, Arroyo collaborated with classical pianist Harrison Sheckler to create a virtual choir recording of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot;. Current and former players, including Cy Young winner Bret Saberhagen, as well as announcers and other baseball personalities, were among the final 200 participants in the choir.

In 2024, Arroyo competed in season twelve of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Sherlock Hound&quot; and had Barry Zito (who competed in season three as &quot;Rhino&quot;) serving as his Mask Ambassador. He was eliminated in &quot;Group C Finals: Peanuts Thanksgiving&quot; alongside Jana Kramer as &quot;Royal Knight&quot;.

==Personal life==
Arroyo was married to Aimee Faught from 2000 to 2008. He resides in the Cincinnati area with his wife Nicole McNees, who he married in 2021.

==Accolades==
Arroyo appeared on the 2023 ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He received one vote (0.3%), thus dropping off future ballots.

On October 26, 2023, Arroyo was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds team Hall of Fame.
