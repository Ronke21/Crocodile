<text>Wincenty Witos (; 21 or 22 January 1874 – 31 October 1945) was a Polish statesman, prominent member and leader of the Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL), who served three times as the Prime Minister of Poland in the 1920s.

He was a member of the Polish People&#x27;s Party from 1895, and the leader of its &quot;Piast&quot; faction from 1913. He was a member of parliament in the Galician Sejm from 1908–1914, and an envoy to &quot;Reichsrat&quot; in Vienna from 1911 to 1918. Witos was also a leader of Polish Liquidation Committee () in 1918, head of the Piast party, and member of parliament in the Polish Sejm from 1919-1920.

He served three times as the premier of Poland, in 1920–1921, 1923 (Chjeno-Piast), and 1926. In 1926 the third Witos government was overthrown by the May coup d&#x27;état led by Józef Piłsudski. Witos had been one of the leaders of the opposition to the Sanacja-government as head of Centrolew (1929–1930) and co-founded the People&#x27;s Party. He was imprisoned shortly thereafter, then lived in exile in Czechoslovakia from 1933 to 1939. Over that time, he was seen as &quot;the messiah of the peasants.&quot; Post-exile, he returned to Poland only to be imprisoned again by the invading Germans.

In ill health by March 1941, he was put on supervised release by the Germans and ordered to stay in Wierzchosławice. In July 1944 the German occupation authorities requested that he declare an anti-Soviet appeal, but he refused to do so. In 1945, he was nominated one of the vice-chairmen of the State National Council () after World War II. In 1945-46 the People&#x27;s Party was reorganized and taken over by Stanisław Mikołajczyk.

==Early life==

Wincenty was born in a peasant family in Wierzchosławice. His parents were Wojciech and Katarzyna née Sroka. The family was poor, owning little land and no livestock and they lived in a single room hut which had been converted from a barn. Wincenty had two brothers, Jan and Andrzej. Andrzej would also become a leader in the Polish agrarian movement.

He began his education in the village school at the age of ten and finished four grades. Subsequently, he worked, helping his father, as a lumberjack for Prince Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko.

Between 1895 and 1897 Wincenty served in the Austrian Army (Galicia was part of the Austrian partition of Poland), first in infantry then in the artillery. He was stationed in Tarnów, Kraków and Krzesławice.

He married Katarzyna Trach on 9 February 1898. His daughter Julia was born on 22 March 1899.

==Early political activity==

At the age of nineteen he published his first newspaper article in the &quot;Przyjaciel Ludu&quot; (&quot;Friend of the People&quot;) based in Lwów (Lviv, Lemberg), under the name &quot;Maciej Rydz&quot;. In 1895 Witos joined the Galician &quot;Stronnictwo Ludowe&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot;) and in February 1903 he was elected to the Executive Committee of the party. In 1908 he was elected as a delegate to the Diet of Galicia in Lwow and served until 1914.

In April 1909 Witos was elected the &quot;wójt&quot; (mayor) of his native Wierzchosławice. During his tenure he focused on the economic development of the village, oversaw the construction of a mill and a social center, improved local roads, expanded the school and organized a farmer&#x27;s cooperative and credit union. He gradually rose in the ranks of the agrarian movement.

==Road to independence==

In December 1913 the People&#x27;s Party split. As a result, in February 1914, Witos was elected as vice president of the newly created political party Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe &quot;Piast&quot; (Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot;). In 1911 he served as a deputy of the party to Austria&#x27;s Imperial Council&#x27;s House of Representatives. Technically he remained the member of the Austrian government until 1918.

After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Witos became even more involved in party activities. The group joined the Supreme National Committee a quasi-government for the Poles in Galicia, for which Witos served as vice president. As the political events associated with the war unfolded and the Committee became more and more irrelevant, Witos resigned.

During the war Witos kept in touch with Polish independence movement activists, including Ignacy Paderewski and Jędrzej Moraczewski. He also supported Józef Piłsudski, whom he saw as the future leader of a reconstituted Polish army. &quot;Piast&quot;&#x27;s backing for Piłsudski increased after the Oath Crisis and the internment of Piłsudski by the Germans. Gradually, the agrarians of the Polish People&#x27;s Party came to believe that the cause of Polish independence was best served by an alliance with the alliance and so began supporting the pro-Entente, anti-German, National Democrats. In 1917 Witos joined Roman Dmowski&#x27;s National League although he left the organization in 1918.

In 1916 he became the president of &quot;Piast&quot;. He coauthored a manifesto, which declared the aims of a reconstituted, independent Poland and was published in May 1917. On 28 September 1918, he was one of the two directors of the Polish Liquidation Committee, a temporary government whose purpose was to preserve law and order in the former Austrian partition during the transition to an elected Polish government. The Committee declared Western Galicia independent of the Austria-Hungary. Witos was invited to join the government of Ignacy Daszyński but turned the offer down for political differences. Witos was also unsatisfied with the fact that the new government had no representative from the Prussian Partition.

==Prime Minister: 1920-1921, 1923, 1926==

===Second Cabinet===

On 17 May 1923, an agreement was held in Warsaw between the Polish centre (Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot;) and right-wing parties (primarily Związek Ludowo-Narodowy and Polskie Stronnictwo Chrześcijańskiej Demokracji and several smaller parties, known as the Christian Union of National Unity alliance or &quot;Chjena&quot;) called the Lanckorona Pact (). The politicians of those parties agreed to pursue stricter polonization policies and to increase the role of Catholic Church in the state. Furthermore, the program of Polonization of the Eastern Borderlands was to be initiated. The pact was signed at Warsaw&#x27;s apartment of Juliusz Zdanowski, one of the leaders of Zwiazek Ludowo-Narodowy. Its name refers to the fact, that it was negotiated in the real estate of Senator Ludwik Hammerling, who was elected in the district which included Lanckorona. The agreement led to the dismissal of the government of Władysław Sikorski and creation of the Chjeno-Piast coalition on 28 May, with the new government of Witos. Former Polish chief of state, Józef Piłsudski, who resigned claiming that he would not participate in the government, which is made of parties responsible for the death of President Narutowicz.

He resigned in December 1923.

===Third Cabinet and Coup d&#x27;état===
In November 1925, the government of Prime Minister Władysław Grabski was replaced by the government led by Minister of Foreign Affairs Aleksander Skrzyński, which had received support from the National Democrats and the Polish Socialist Party. General Lucjan Żeligowski became the new government&#x27;s minister of military affairs. However, after the PPS withdrew its support, this government also fell and was replaced by that of Witos, formed by the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot; and the Christian Union of National Unity (Chjeno-Piast). However, the new government had even less popular support than the previous ones, and pronouncements from Józef Piłsudski, who viewed the constant power shifts in the Sejm as chaotic and damaging, set the stage for a coup d&#x27;état. Apart from domestic turmoil, Polish politics had been shaken by a trade war with Germany, begun in June 1925, and by the signing of the Treaty of Locarno on 1 December. Under the terms of the treaty, the World War I western European Allied powers plus Germany guaranteed the inviolability of the German border with Belgium and France as determined by the Treaty of Versailles. On 10 May 1926, a coalition government of Christian Democrats and Agrarians was formed, and that same day Józef Piłsudski, in an interview with Kurier Poranny (the Morning Courier), said that he was &quot;ready to fight the evil&quot; of sejmocracy and promised a &quot;sanation&quot; (restoration to health) of political life. The newspaper edition was confiscated by the authorities.

The night of 11 to 12 May, a state of alert was declared in the Warsaw military garrison, and some units marched to Rembertów, where they pledged their support to Piłsudski. On 12 May, they marched on Warsaw and captured bridges over the Wisła River. Meanwhile, Witos&#x27; government declared a state of emergency. At about 17:00 hours, Marshal Piłsudski met President Stanisław Wojciechowski on the Poniatowski Bridge. Major Marian Porwit who commanded one of the troops loyal to the government), reported to the president, then reported to Piłsudski and witnessed the discussion between the two dignitaries. Piłsudski demanded the resignation of Witos&#x27; cabinet, while the President demanded Piłsudski&#x27;s capitulation. After the failure of negotiations and the president&#x27;s departure, Major Porwit refused Piłsudski to let him cross the bridge. On 14 May, at about 13:00 hours, Witos&#x27; cabinet decided to move from the Belweder Palace to Wilanów. Wojciechowski allowed this decision an hour later. 
After transferring to Wilanów, Wojciechowski and Witos negotiated with the commanders of troops loyal to the cabinet. The military decided they should move to Poznań and maintain the armed struggle from beyond. Eventually, to prevent the Warsaw fighting from turning into a country-wide civil war, both Wojciechowski and Witos decided to resign and issued an order to their troops to cease fratricidal fighting. A new government was formed under Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, with Piłsudski as the new Minister of Military Affairs. On 31 May 1926, the National Assembly nominated Piłsudski to be president, but he declined. Eventually Ignacy Mościcki became the new president; Piłsudski, however, wielded much greater &quot; de facto&quot; power than his military ministry nominally gave him.

==Post-Premiership==

===Centrolew===

On 26 May 1926, Witos resigned as President of the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot; shortly after his removal from power, though it was not adopted. He resigned in 1927 as President of the Małopolska Agricultural Society due to the limitation of state financial assistance. On 18 August 1927, the Krakow Provincial Office dissolved the Union of Commune Heads, which was created by Witos and operating in Lesser Poland under his own leadership. In the 1928 Polish legislative election, Witos successfully applied for parliamentary re-election as the member of the Sejm for the Tarnów district, by obtaining the largest number of votes for this constituency. On 9 April 1929, the Voivode of Kraków Voivodeship Mikołaj Kwaśniewski, removed Witos from the Tarnów local government board, to which he served as a member of this board since 1905. Witos remained in clear opposition during the Sanation regime. 

From 1929–1930, Witos was one of the leaders of Centrolew (), a coalition of several Polish political parties (Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot;, Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot;, National Workers&#x27; Party, Polish Socialist Party and Christian-democratic parties). The coalition was directed against Piłsudski and the Sanation government. Witos participated, among others at the Congress of Defense of People&#x27;s Rights and Freedom in Krakow (organized by Centrolew) in June 1930, during which he gave a speech.

===Brest trials===

The Polish Sanation government had invalidated the 1930 election results by disbanding the parliament in August and with increasing pressure on the opposition started a new campaign, the new elections being scheduled for November. Using anti-government demonstrations as a pretext, 20 members of the opposition, including most of the leaders of the &quot;Centrolew&quot; alliance (from Polish Socialist Party, Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot; and Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot;) were arrested in September without a warrant, only strictly on the order of Józef Piłsudski and the then Minister of Internal Security, Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski, accusing them of plotting an anti-government coup. The opposition members (who included Witos, and Wojciech Korfanty) were imprisoned in the Brest Fortress, where their trial took place (thus the popular name for the election: the &#x27;Brest election&#x27;). The detainee (including Witos&#x27; inmates and opponents of the Sanation) were beaten and humiliated. Witos was ordered, among others manually cleaning latrines and emptying faeces buckets. A little later he was taken to the arrest in Grójec. On 27 November 1930 (the same day he was re-elected to the Sejm), Witos left prison, his bail was set at 10,000 zloty.

Regardless of Sanation&#x27;s struggle against the well-known parties, Witos declared the need to consolidate with peasant groups. On 15 March 1931, he formed the &quot;united&quot; People&#x27;s Party from the merger of three other, smaller, peasant-based parties: the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot;, Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot; and left-wing Stronnictwo Chłopskie (SCh). On 26 October 1931, the Brest trial began in Warsaw. Witos and the other 10 accused were charged with the fact that in the period from 1928 to 9 September 1930, following the communicating between each other and acting consciously, they jointly prepared an assassination attempt whose purpose was to forcefully remove members of the Council of Ministers and replace them by other people, although without a fundamental change state system. None of the accused pleaded guilty after 55 hearings from the trial. Witos used the opportunity to explain the harsh criticisms of Sanation&#x27;s actions, starting with the May Coup of 1926. Among others, Witos stated: Your Honor, I was the president of this government that was overthrown by the May coup. So I wasn&#x27;t plotting, I wasn&#x27;t plotting, but I, along with the government, was the victim of a plot and assassination. This government was not a usurper government, it was a constitutional government, in a lawful manner, in a completely lawful manner appointed by the President of the Republic of Poland. Someone else was swinging, someone else was plotting, and I am sitting on the bench!

During the trial, Witos&#x27;s lawyer was attorney Stanisław Szurlej. The accused were acquitted of the charge of preparing a coup d&#x27;état, though they were convicted of their activities. Witos was sentenced to 1/5 years in prison and deprived of public rights for 3 years. Witos was imposed a fine of PLN 80, similar to the fine imposed on Kazimierz Bagiński. The Brest trial ended in January 1932, with 10 accused receiving sentences up to three years of imprisonment; the appeals of 1933 confirmed the sentences. On 7–11 February 1933, an appeal hearing was held which culminated in the approval of the first-instance judgment. On 9 May, the Supreme Court cancelled this judgment and referred the case back to the court. On 11–20 July, a second hearing was held before the Court of Appeal which found the first judgment justified. The verdict was finally approved by the Supreme Court, which on 2–5 October, reconsidered the appeal of the defenders. Five of the convicts went to prison to serve their sentence. Witos, Adam Pragier, Wladyslaw Kiernik, Kazimierz Baginski and Herman Lieberman went into exile, before the approval of the judgment by the Supreme Court. They wrote in a joint statement: We will not again be hostage to the dictatorship, as in 1930 ... The country demands from us not martyrdom, but a struggle to remove the mafia, which established its reign on lies, harm and depravity of characters. We left Poland to continue fighting the hated dictatorship.

<text>In macroeconomics, the &quot;workforce&quot; or labour force is the sum of those either working (i.e., the employed) or looking for work (i.e., the unemployed):

formula_1

Those neither working in the marketplace nor looking for work are out of the labour force.

The sum of the labour force and out of the labour force results in the noninstitutional civilian population, that is, the number of people who (1) work (i.e., the employed), (2) can work but don&#x27;t, although they are looking for a job (i.e., the unemployed), or (3) can work but don&#x27;t, and are not looking for a job (i.e., out of the labour force). Stated otherwise, the noninstitutional civilian population is the total population minus people who cannot or choose not to work (children, retirees, soldiers, and incarcerated people). The noninstitutional civilian population is the number of people potentially available for civilian employment.

formula_2

The labour force participation rate is defined as the ratio of the civilian labour force to the noninstitutional civilian population.

formula_3

==Formal and informal==

Formal labour is any sort of employment that is structured and paid in a formal way. They are paid formally using payrolls paper, electronic card and alike. Unlike the informal sector of the economy, formal labour within a country contributes to that country&#x27;s gross national product. Informal labour is labour that falls short of being a formal arrangement in law or in practice. Labour inherit may come as formal or non-formal, an employee old enough but below retirement age bracket passing on to his children. It can be paid or unpaid and it is always unstructured and unregulated. Formal employment is more reliable than informal employment. Generally, the former yields higher income and greater benefits and securities for both men and women.

===Informal labour===
The contribution of informal labourers is immense. Informal labour is expanding globally, most significantly in developing countries. According to a study done by Jacques Charmes, in the year 2000 informal labour made up 57% of non-agricultural employment, 40% of urban employment, and 83% of the new jobs in Latin America. That same year, informal labour made up 78% of non-agricultural employment, 61% of urban employment, and 93% of the new jobs in Africa. Particularly after an economic crisis, labourers tend to shift from the formal sector to the informal sector. This trend was seen after the Asian economic crisis which began in 1997.

===Informal labour and gender===

Gender is frequently associated with informal labour. Women are employed more often informally than they are formally, and informal labour is an overall larger source of employment for females than it is for males. Women frequent the informal sector of the economy through occupations like home-based workers and street vendors. The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World shows that in the 1990s, 81% of women in Benin were street vendors, 55% in Guatemala, 44% in Mexico, 33% in Kenya, and 14% in India. Overall, 60% of women workers in the developing world are employed in the informal sector.

The specific percentages are 84% and 58% for women in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America respectively. The percentages for men in both of these areas of the world are lower, amounting to 63% and 48% respectively. In Asia, 65% of women workers and 65% of men workers are employed in the informal sector. Globally, a large percentage of women that are formally employed also work in the informal sector behind the scenes. These women make up the hidden work force.

According to a 2021 FAO study, currently, 85 per cent of economic activity in Africa is conducted in the informal sector where women account for nearly 90 per cent of the informal labour force. According to the ILO&#x27;s 2016 employment analysis, 64 per cent of informal employment is in agriculture (relative to industry and services) in sub-Saharan Africa. Women have higher rates of informal employment than men with 92 per cent of women workers in informal employment versus 86 per cent of men.

Formal and informal labour can be divided into the subcategories of agricultural work and non-agricultural work. Martha Chen &quot;et al.&quot; believe these four categories of labour are closely related to one another. A majority of agricultural work is informal, which the Penguin Atlas for Women in the World defines as unregistered or unstructured. Non-agricultural work can also be informal. According to Martha Chen &quot;et al.&quot;, informal labour makes up 48% of non-agricultural work in North Africa, 51% in Latin America, 65% in Asia, and 72% in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Agriculture and informal economic activity are among some of the most important sources of livelihood for women. Women are estimated to account for approximately 70 per cent of informal cross-border traders and are also prevalent among owners of micro, small, or medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). MSMEs are more vulnerable to market shocks and market disruptions. For women-owned MSMEs this is often compounded by their lack of access to credit and financial liquidity compared to larger businesses. However, MSMEs are often more vulnerable to market shocks and market disruptions. For women-owned MSMEs, this is often compounded by their lack of access to credit and financial liquidity compared to larger businesses.

== Agricultural work ==
==Paid and unpaid==
Paid and unpaid work are also closely related with formal and informal labour. Some informal work is unpaid, or paid under the table. Unpaid work can be work that is done at home to sustain a family, like child care work, or actual habitual daily labour that is not monetarily rewarded, like working the fields. Unpaid workers have zero earnings, and although their work is valuable, it is hard to estimate its value. Men and women tend to work in different areas of the economy, regardless of whether their work is paid or unpaid. Women focus on the service sector, while men focus on the industrial sector.

===Unpaid work and gender===
Women usually work fewer hours in income generating jobs than men do. Often it is housework that is unpaid. Worldwide, women and girls are responsible for a great amount of household work.

The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World, published in 2008, stated that in Madagascar, women spend 20 hours per week on housework, while men spend only two. In Mexico, women spend 33 hours and men spend 5 hours. In Mongolia the housework hours amount to 27 and 12 for women and men respectively. In Spain, women spend 26 hours on housework and men spend 4 hours. Only in the Netherlands do men spend 10% more time than women do on activities within the home or for the household.

The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World also stated that in developing countries, women and girls spend a significant amount of time fetching water for the week, while men do not. For example, in Malawi women spend 6.3 hours per week fetching water, while men spend 43 minutes. Girls in Malawi spend 3.3 hours per week fetching water, and boys spend 1.1 hours. Even if women and men both spend time on household work and other unpaid activities, this work is also gendered.

=== Sick leave and gender ===
In the United Kingdom in 2014, two-thirds of workers on long-term sick leave were women, despite women only constituting half of the workforce, even after excluding maternity leave.

==Globalisation of the labour market==

The global supply of labour almost doubled in absolute numbers between the 1980s and early 2000s, with half of that growth coming from Asia. At the same time, the rate at which new workers entered the workforce in the Western world began to decline. The growing pool of global labour is accessed by employers in more advanced economies through various methods, including imports of goods, offshoring of production, and immigration. Global labor arbitrage, the practice of accessing the lowest-cost workers from all parts of the world, is partly a result of this enormous growth in the workforce. While most of the absolute increase in this global labour supply consisted of less-educated workers (those without higher education), the relative supply of workers with higher education increased by about 50 percent during the same period. From 1980 to 2010, the global workforce grew from 1.2 to 2.9 billion people. According to a 2012 report by the McKinsey Global Institute, this was caused mostly by developing nations, where there was a &quot;farm to factory&quot; transition. Non-farming jobs grew from 54 percent in 1980 to almost 73 percent in 2010. This industrialization took an estimated 620 million people out of poverty and contributed to the economic development of China, India and others.

Under the &quot;old&quot; international division of labor, until around 1970, underdeveloped areas were incorporated into the world economy principally as suppliers of minerals and agricultural commodities. However, as developing economies are merged into the world economy, more production takes place in these economies. This has led to a trend of transference, or what is also known as the &quot;global industrial shift &quot;, in which production processes are relocated from developed countries (such as the US, European countries, and Japan) to developing countries in Asia (such as China, Vietnam, and India), Mexico and Central America. This is because companies search for the cheapest locations to manufacture and assemble components, so low-cost labor-intensive parts of the manufacturing process are shifted to the developing world where costs are substantially lower. 

But not only manufacturing processes are shifted to the developing world. The growth of offshore outsourcing of IT-enabled services (such as offshore custom software development and business process outsourcing) is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s.

<text>PS &quot;Waverley&quot; is the last seagoing passenger-carrying paddle steamer in the world. Built in 1946, she sailed from Craigendoran on the Firth of Clyde to Arrochar on Loch Long until 1973. Bought by the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society (PSPS), she has been restored to her 1947 appearance and now operates passenger excursions around the British coast.

Since 2003, &quot;Waverley&quot; has been listed in the National Historic Fleet by National Historic Ships UK as &quot;a vessel of pre-eminent national importance&quot;.

==History==
PS &quot;Waverley&quot; is named after Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s first novel. She was built for the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) to replace a PS &quot;Waverley&quot; that was sunk in 1940 while helping to evacuate troops from Dunkirk. The new vessel was ordered from shipbuilders A. &amp; J. Inglis of Glasgow, who laid the keel at their Pointhouse shipyard on 27 December 1945, Lady Matthews, wife of the Chairman of the LNER, launched the new 693 ton steamer on 2 October 1946. Fitting out proceeded, around the end of the year the ship was towed to Victoria Harbour in Greenock where Rankin &amp; Blackmore installed the engine and coal-fired boiler they had manufactured. After sea trials in June 1947, &quot;Waverley&quot; entered service on 16 June, working the LNER&#x27;s Firth of Clyde steamer route from Craigendoran Pier, near Helensburgh, up Loch Long to Lochgoilhead and Arrochar, joining the LNER Clyde paddle steamer fleet of , and &quot;Talisman&quot;. In her first year in service, she wore that company&#x27;s red, white and black funnel colours.

The 1948 nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways brought their Scottish steamers into the Caledonian Steam Packet Company (CSP), a subsidiary of the Railway Executive. The funnels were repainted yellow with a black top. In 1965, a Scottish red lion rampant was fixed to each side of both funnels. &quot;Waverley&quot;″s hull was painted monastral blue until 1970.

After a revival of fortunes in the 1950s, the 1960s saw a gradual change in holiday habits that led to a decline in passenger numbers and the closure of many of the small piers. Since 1969, and the formation of the Scottish Transport Group, the CSP had been gradually merging with the West Highland shipping and ferry company David MacBrayne Ltd. In 1973, the company became Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd (CalMac).

==Restoration==

CalMac withdrew &quot;Waverley&quot; after the 1973 season as she was too costly to operate and needed significant expenditure. By then, the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society had been set up as a registered UK charity and had bought the near-derelict small River Dart paddler . CalMac, keen to ensure that the ship was preserved, sold &quot;Waverley&quot; to the PSPS for the token sum of one pound. Neither side really believed that the vessel would return to steam but, just in case, Caledonian MacBrayne stipulated that she should not sail in competition with their remaining cruise vessel, .

A public appeal was launched to secure funding for the return of the &quot;Waverley&quot; to service and the fund-raising operation was successful. The PSPS found itself running a cruise ship operation, &quot;Waverley Excursions&quot;. Since then, &quot;Waverley&quot; has been joined in the PSPS fleet by and and has had a series of extensive refits and much restoration work, including a new boiler and improvements to meet modern safety standards. She has circumnavigated Great Britain and every year makes extensive sailings around the country.

Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, between 2000 and 2003 the ship underwent a substantial rebuild and reboilering at the shipyard of George Prior at Great Yarmouth, funded principally by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The work, done in two stages, has added many 21st century safety and technological improvements and returned the ship to her original 1947 livery.

In 2009, the ship was affiliated with , having hosted the official dignitary party at &quot;Defender&quot;s launch on the River Clyde. And in 2011 the ship was awarded the Institution of Mechanical Engineers 65th Engineering Heritage Award.

In 2019, &quot;Waverley&quot; was withdrawn from service due to boiler problems. An appeal was subsequently launched with a target of £2.3 million to recommission &quot;Waverley&quot;. It was announced on 11 July 2019 that new boilers had been ordered from Cochran Ltd.

Following the boiler replacement, &quot;Waverley&quot; returned to sea on 13 August 2020 for sea-trials, and resumed service for a short COVID-19-affected season starting on 22 August. This was cut short after she struck the pier at Brodick on 3 September, damaging her bow.

The following year &quot;Waverley&quot; started operating from 29 June but with limited passenger capacity due to COVID-19. The sailing season was described as a success, with a total of 52,000 passenger journeys, but shorter than normal as it only lasted until 19 September. A highlight for passengers and crew were the dolphins that could frequently be spotted as they accompanied &quot;Waverley&quot; on her sails up and down the Clyde.

==Engine==

&quot;Waverley&quot; is powered by a three-crank diagonal triple-expansion marine steam engine built by Rankin &amp; Blackmore, Engineers, Eagle Foundry, Greenock, Scotland. It is rated at 2,100 IHP and achieved a trial speed of at 57.8 rpm. Passengers can watch this engine from passageways on either side of the engine room.

The main crank is solidly attached to both paddle wheels so they cannot turn independently. The &quot;Waverley&quot; therefore has a much larger turning circle than modern ferries.

==Appearance==

&quot;Waverley&quot; has had several colour schemes in her life. At launch the paddle boxes were painted black, in 1959 they were changed to white, then returned to black but with white edges in 1972, then to all black in 1977. The two gold stripes along the hull were removed in 1954 but restored during the 2000 rebuild. Today, &quot;Waverley&quot; has the LNER 1947 livery of red, white and black funnels, traditional brown-grained (or &quot;scumbled&quot;) superstructure and black paddle-wheel boxes, decorated with gold lettering on each side.

When launched Waverley had square windows on her sponsons, instead of the current portholes. For most of her life, the upper passenger cabins were painted white and had wooden doors; all have had layout improvements at some time in the ship&#x27;s life. Sailing in all weathers in salt water can cause pale brown rust streaks to appear by the end of each season, so cosmetic painting and improvements are done annually as the ship is drydocked and inspected by the Department for Transport.

Since 1962, when PS &quot;Waverley&quot;″s original funnels were renewed, replacement items had been slightly out of parallel due to their heavier welded steel construction. The problem was resolved in the 2000–03 refit and her two funnels are now parallel.

Lifeboat arrangements have varied depending on the legislation at the time. Between 1975 and 1980, there was only one traditional lifeboat on the rear deck.

==Service==

&quot;Waverley&quot; makes passenger excursions from various British ports, including ports in Northern Ireland. She regularly sails from Glasgow and other towns on the Firth of Clyde, the Thames, the South Coast of England and the Bristol Channel. She also undertakes private charters and has provided a period setting for television documentaries and movies, such as &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; (2011).

Primarily during the summer she is based on the Clyde, operating excursions from Glasgow, Greenock, Largs or Ayr.

Typically her Clyde timetable ends at the end of August and &quot;Waverley&quot; spends 6 weeks between September and October cruising the Bristol Channel, the Solent and the Thames before returning to the Clyde for two sailings in October.

On 3 September 2020, &quot;Waverley&quot; collided with the Brodick Pier on the Isle of Arran, causing damage to the bow. Twenty-four people were injured. The ship was carrying 213 passengers and 26 crew, who were temporarily stranded on Arran. A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, , made an unscheduled sailing to return them to the Scottish mainland later that evening.

During the 2021 season &quot;Waverley&quot; was unable to operate south of the Clyde owing to crew availability. 2022 marks the 75th anniversary of her maiden voyage and she was able to return to other parts of the British coast.

In 2023, during the ships sailing to the South Coast, Waverley and the steamship SS &quot;Shieldhall&quot; sailed side-by-side as the two vessels passed The Needles. The occasion of the two vessels with similar histories sailing together was met with great praise from guests on both vessels and garnered national attention for both vessels.

<text>Tristram Ogilvie Cary, OAM (14 May 192524 April 2008), was a pioneering English-Australian composer. He was also active as a teacher and music critic.

==Career==
Cary was born in Oxford, England, and educated at the Dragon School in Oxford and Westminster School in London. He was the third son and child of a pianist and the Ulster-born novelist Joyce Cary, author of &quot;Mister Johnson&quot;. While working as a radar engineer for the Royal Navy during World War II, he independently developed his own conception of electronic and tape music, and is regarded as being amongst the earliest pioneers of these musical forms.

Following World War II, he created one of the first electronic music studios, later travelling around Europe to meet the small numbers of other early pioneers of electronic music and composition. He studied arts at the University of Oxford and went on to study composition, conducting, piano, viola and horn at Trinity College London.

With Peter Zinovieff and David Cockerell, he founded Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd, which created the first commercially available portable synthesiser, the EMS VCS 3, and was then involved in the production of such distinctive EMS products as the EMS Synthi 100.

In 1967 he created an electronic music studio at the Royal College of Music. This led to an invitation from the University of Melbourne in 1973 for a lecture tour, which in turn led to an invitation to become the Visiting Composer at the University of Adelaide in 1974. He remained there as a lecturer until 1986. He also wrote music criticism for &quot;The Australian&quot;.

==Musical works==
His concert works of note include a Sonata for guitar (1959), &quot;Continuum&quot; for tape (1969), a cantata &quot;Peccata Mundi&quot; (1972), &quot;Contours and Densities at First Hill&quot; for orchestra (1972), a Nonet (1979), String Quartet No. 2 (1985) and &quot;The Dancing Girls&quot; for orchestra (1991).

Cary is also particularly well known for his film and television music. He wrote music for the science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (including the first Dalek story), as well as the score for the Ealing comedy &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955). Later film scores included &quot;The Boy Who Stole a Million&quot; (1960); &quot;The Prince and The Pauper&quot; (1962); &quot;Sammy Going South&quot; (1963); &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1967) and &quot;Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1971), both for Hammer. He also composed the score for the ABC TV animated version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. and the children&#x27;s animated special &quot;Katya and the Nutcracker&quot;.

Cary was one of the first British composers to work in musique concrète. In 1967 he created the first electronic music studio of the Royal College of Music. He built another at his home in Fressingfield, Suffolk which he transported to Australia when he emigrated there, and incorporated it into the University of Adelaide where he worked as a lecturer until 1986.

He provided the visual design for the EMS VCS3 synthesizer.

==Death==
Cary died in Adelaide, South Australia, on 24 April 2008, aged 82.

==Honours==
Cary won the 1977 Albert H. Maggs Composition Award. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1991 in recognition of service to music. He also received the 2005 lifetime achievement award from the Adelaide Critics&#x27; Circle for his contribution to music in England and Australia.

<text>The inclosure acts created legal property rights to land previously held in common in England and Wales, particularly open fields and common land. Between 1604 and 1914 over 5,200 individual acts enclosing public land were passed, affecting 28,000 km2.

==History==

Before the enclosures in England, a portion of the land was categorized as &quot;common&quot; or &quot;waste&quot;. &quot;Common&quot; land was under the control of the lord of the manor, but certain rights on the land such as pasture, pannage, or estovers were held variously by certain nearby properties, or (occasionally) &quot;in gross&quot; by all manorial tenants. &quot;Waste&quot; was land without value as a farm strip – often very narrow areas (typically less than a yard wide) in awkward locations (such as cliff edges, or inconveniently shaped manorial borders), but also bare rock, and similar. &quot;Waste&quot; was not officially used by anyone, and so was often farmed by landless peasants.

The remaining land was organised into a large number of narrow strips, each tenant possessing a number of disparate strips throughout the manor, as would the manorial lord. Called the open-field system, it was administered by manorial courts, which exercised some collective control. What might now be termed a single field would have been divided under this system among the lord and his tenants; poorer peasants (serfs or copyholders, depending on the era) were allowed to live on the strips owned by the lord in return for cultivating his land. The system facilitated common grazing and crop rotation.

Any individual might possess several strips of land within the manor, often at some distance from one another. Seeking better financial returns, landowners looked for more efficient farming techniques. Enclosure acts for small areas had been passed sporadically since the 12th century, but advances in agricultural knowledge and technology in the 18th century made them more commonplace. Because tenants, or even copyholders, had legally enforceable rights on the land, substantial compensation was provided to extinguish them; thus many tenants were active supporters of enclosure, though it enabled landlords to force reluctant tenants to comply with the process.

With legal control of the land, landlords introduced innovations in methods of crop production, increasing profits and supporting the Agricultural Revolution; higher productivity also enabled landowners to justify higher rents for the people working the land.

The powers granted in the Inclosure Act 1773 (13 Geo. 3. c. 81) of the Parliament of Great Britain were often abused by landowners: the preliminary meetings where enclosure was discussed, intended to be held in public, often took place in the presence of only the local landowners, who regularly chose their own solicitors, surveyors and commissioners to decide on each case. In 1786 there were still 250,000 independent landowners, but in the course of only thirty years their number was reduced to 32,000.

The tenants displaced by the process often left the countryside to work in the towns. This contributed to the Industrial Revolution – at the very moment new technological advances required large numbers of workers, a concentration of large numbers of people in need of work had emerged; the former country tenants and their descendants became workers in industrial factories within cities.

The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 (41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. 109) was passed to tidy up previous acts. The Inclosure Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 118) instituted the appointment of Inclosure Commissioners, who could enclose land without submitting a request to Parliament.

<text>Murdoch Mackay (April 30, 1884 – December 18, 1962) was a Manitoba politician. He led the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1931 to 1932, and brought the party into an alliance with John Bracken&#x27;s Progressives.

== Biography ==
Mackay was born on Boularderie Island, Nova Scotia, the son of John Mackay and Anna MacAulay. He subsequently moved to Manitoba, and was elected to the provincial legislature in the general election of 1927. A Liberal, Mackay defeated Progressive incumbent Clifford Barclay by 18 votes in the riding of Springfield.

The provincial Liberals fared poorly in this election, winning only seven seats in a 55-member legislature. Party leader Hugh Robson stepped down in 1930. After a brief period in which James Breakey led the parliamentary caucus, Mackay was chosen over Fred C. Hamilton as party leader in 1931.

MacKay brought the Manitoba Liberals into an alliance with the governing Progressives in 1932. By this time, the Liberals and Progressives of Manitoba were already co-operating at the federal level; national Liberal leader William Lyon Mackenzie King wanted the same alliance at the provincial level to prevent a Conservative victory in the next election. The Liberals joined the government in early 1932, and two members of the party were brought into cabinet. Mackay himself was made a Minister without Portfolio on May 27, 1932.

His term in office was brief. The united &quot;Liberal-Progressives&quot; easily defeated the Conservatives in the election, but Mackay was defeated by Barclay (now running as an &quot;Independent Farmer-Labour&quot; candidate) in Springfield. He resigned from cabinet, and left provincial politics. Mackay attempted a comeback in 1945, but lost to CCF candidate George Olive by over one thousand votes.

As well as being a politician, MacKay was known by many as a prominent local physician in the town of Transcona, with a reputation for kindness and a great sense of humour. He graduated from Manitoba Medical School in 1916 and married Ruby Gowland the following year. They had four daughters who all graduated from the University of Manitoba. Throughout his career, MacKay was well known for his compassion - accepting food from patients that could not afford to pay upfront. He remains a community hero and his commitment to the Transcona area was honoured in his 2005 nomination as &quot;The Greatest Transconian&quot;.

MacKay died at Saint Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg on December 18, 1962, and was buried at Transcona Cemetery.

MacKay had a great love of learning and, as such, Murdoch MacKay Collegiate, a high school in Winnipeg, was named in his honour in 1964.

<text>The Queers are an American punk rock band, formed in 1981 by Portsmouth, New Hampshire native Joseph “Joe” P. King (a.k.a. Joe Queer) along with Scott Gildersleeve (a.k.a. Tulu), and John “Jack” Hayes (a.k.a. Wimpy Rutherford). With the addition of Keith Hages (ex-guitarist of Berlin Brats) joining on bass in 1983 the band started playing their first public performances. The revised line-up played a total of six live shows between 1983 and 1984. This earliest era of The Queers formation initially broke up in late 1984; however, Joe Queer re-formed the band with an all-new line-up in 1986. In 1990, after several more band line-up changes the band signed with Shakin&#x27; Street Records to release their debut album, &quot;Grow Up&quot;. The album earned the band notability within New England, but with the release of their next album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Love Songs for the Retarded&quot;, on Lookout! Records, their following grew.

In 2006, after releasing six albums on Lookout! Records, the band rescinded their master rights from the label, citing breach of contract over unpaid royalties. Later that year they signed with Asian Man Records.

The Queers&#x27; cover of &quot;Wipe Out&quot; was featured in the 2007 Columbia Pictures and ImageWorks Studios mockumentary film &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, produced by Sony Pictures Animation and National Geographic Films.

==History==
The Queers were formed in 1981 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The original line-up consisted of guitarist/vocalist Joe “Queer” King, bassist Tulu, and drummer Wimpy Rutherford. Tulu introduced Joe Queer and Wimpy Rutherford to The Ramones in 1976 but it would be another five years before they formed the Queers shortly after Joe King returned to New Hampshire having spent a summer in Manhattan Beach, California. While Queer was on the west coast he saw many of the original Los Angeles punk rock bands including the Zeros, the Germs, Black Flag, the Dickies, Fear, and Angry Samoans. All three had previously played in earlier bands before forming the Queers including the Objects, the Falling Spikes, the Bugs, and the Monsignors. Tulu and the Objects released an album in 1980 (recorded live in 1978) and released a solo single in 1981 under his given name. Tulu stated that their band moniker had nothing to do with homosexuality, and meant queer as in someone strange or an outsider.

The 1981–1982 original line-up rehearsed in Tulu’s basement but never publicly performed. Their earliest songs were cover songs by the Dave Clark Five, the Monkees, and the Ramones. In 1982 Joe Queer, Tulu, and Wimpy were hanging out and listening to punk rock records that Joe had purchased while living in Manhattan Beach, California and had brought back home to New Hampshire. While the Ramones and Black Flag were the original lineup main influences, two further punk rock records were also a big inspiration for the budding punk rock group. &quot;The Queer Pills&quot; EP by the Angry Samoans was an influence on the groups band moniker and irreverent lyric subject matter while the &quot;Blood Sausage&quot; EP by the Meatmen was the catalyst for writing original songs. After listening to &quot;Blood Sausage,&quot; the band members were all collectively of the opinion that they could &quot;do much better&quot; and commenced to writing original songs. Tulu then wrote the Queers&#x27; first classic, “We’d Have A Riot Doing Heroin”, right on the spot “in about two minutes” and the band was born. Their earliest original songs were subsequently recorded on the Queers&#x27; debut record. After releasing the &quot;Love Me&quot; EP, the group disbanded for a few months while Tulu temporarily moved to New York City, New York in late 1982. While the band was on temporary hiatus, Joe and Wimpy got together and over the course of a few hours in one day wrote enough new songs for a new record. A phone call was made to Tulu to inform him that they had written a great new batch of songs, discussed re-forming the band, and recording another EP. After a fortnight, Joe and Wimpy drove to New York City, located Tulu, and drove back to New Hampshire with newfound enthusiasm and confidence. In 1983 the new line-up found Joe remaining on guitar while Wimpy switched from drums to lead vocals (at the insistence of Tulu and Joe) and Tulu from bass to drums, while their friend Keith Hages (ex Berlin Brats) joined on bass. This line-up recorded the &quot;Kicked Out of the Webelos&quot; EP and performed approximately six live shows (The Masonic Temple, a local pool party, and an outdoor open field gig; all three shows were located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The new line-up also played Geno’s Rock club in Portland, Maine along with two further shows), and broke up for a second time in 1984. Shortly after the breakup the &quot;Webelos&quot; EP was released and Wimpy then went to college in Arizona, Tulu moved to Boston, Massachusetts and reformed the Mosignors, while Joe owned a successful restaurant café while remaining in New Hampshire. While never releasing a proper album at the time, the 1996 compilation &quot;A Day Late and a Dollar Short&quot; compiled the &quot;Love Me&quot; EP (1982), the &quot;Kicked Out of the Webelos&quot; EP (1984), a studio session dating from 1993 recording original songs that were written in 1983 but not recorded in the band’s original era, demo tracks in 1991, and an East Orange, New Jersey live performance in 1994 on independent community radio station WFMU.
In 1986, Joe formed a new version of the band with DMZ guitarist J. J. Rassler, bassist Kevin Kecy, and drummer Hugh O&#x27;Neill. The band broke up again in 1987 after King bought a restaurant, but the next year were re-formed by King and O&#x27;Neill, with Sean Rowley on rhythm guitar and new bassist B-Face. Sean Rowley left the band in 1990 to attend art school. In 1990, this line-up released the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Grow Up&quot;, on a small English label called Shakin&#x27; Street Records. When &quot;Grow Up&quot; caught the attention of Screeching Weasel frontman Ben Weasel, he convinced Lookout! Records owner Larry Livermore to sign the Queers, who released their second album, &quot;Love Songs for the Retarded&quot;, on Lookout! in 1993. To promote the album, the band went on tours with Screeching Weasel and Rancid.

By now, the band had developed problems with drug and alcohol use. Larry Livermore, who was in the studio with the band for &quot;Love Songs for the Retarded&quot;, recalled that while Joe King was able to stop drinking, heroin remained an issue for both King and Hugh O&#x27;Neill. The other members staged an intervention for O&#x27;Neill, who was forced to take a leave of absence from the band to deal with his addiction.

Jay Adelberg filled in on drums, performing on the live album &quot;Shout at the Queers&quot;; their 1994 cover version of the Ramones&#x27; 1977 album &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; (released as part of Selfless Records&#x27; Ramones covers album series); and &quot;Blabbermouth&quot;, their contribution to the 1994 Ben Weasel-curated compilation album &quot;Punk USA&quot;.
The recording for the band&#x27;s next album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Beat Off&quot;, was scheduled to take place partway through a U.S. tour, but O&#x27;Neill was once again sidelined by addiction. The Queers instead recruited Screeching Weasel drummer Dan Panic, and also added his bandmate Dan Vapid as a second guitarist. Panic and Vapid would record &quot;Beat Off&quot; with the Queers, though Vapid&#x27;s guitar parts were removed from the album before its release. They also played on the subsequent live album, &quot;Suck This&quot; (1995), and Vapid would play on 1995&#x27;s &quot;Surf Goddess&quot; EP. For the 1995 studio album &quot;Move Back Home&quot;, O&#x27;Neill returned, and the classic line-up of King, B-Face, and O&#x27;Neill would record one more album together with 1996&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, which also saw the return of JJ Rassler on guitar. The album also marked the last release with Lookout! Records. The band had been offered a three-album deal with Epitaph Records, which King was in favor of, but B-Face and O&#x27;Neill weren&#x27;t. The rift over this caused King to replace them with bassist Dave Swain from Jon Cougar Concentration Camp, and The Dwarves drummer Chris Fields. After leaving the Queers, B-Face would play bass for Chixdiggit!, the Mopes, and the Groovie Ghoulies, while O&#x27;Neill developed brain cancer, dying on January 20, 1999.

==Musical style and influences ==
The Queers play a Ramones-derived style of pop punk. Much like The Ramones, common lyrical themes are of girls, love, drugs, alcohol and having fun. Musically the band deviates slightly from the driving rhythm guitar sound of the Ramones and augments their songs with harmony vocals and guitar solos. They have been described by Livermore as &quot;The Ramones meets The Beach Boys&quot;. Ben Weasel of Screeching Weasel infrequently collaborates on songwriting with Joe Queer. The band is well known for the variety of cover versions they include on their records and during live performances. Bands/artists covered by The Queers include The Beach Boys, Ramones (including a complete re-recording of the &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; album), Unnatural Axe, The Nobodys, Angry Samoans, The Mr. T Experience, Skeeter Davis, The Fantastic Baggys, The Who, The Undertones, The Hobos, Tommy James and The Shondells, Helen Love, The Catalogs (from Hawaii, featuring Les Hernandez of The Quintessentials), The Banana Splits and many more.

Tom DeLonge of Blink-182, and Mike Herrera of MxPx, have cited The Queers as an influence. In 2008, a tribute album titled &quot;God Save The Queers&quot; was released, which featured covers by bands including Dwarves, Screeching Weasel, Teengenerate, New Bomb Turks, The Jolts, Hard-Ons, Toys That Kill, Parasites, Toothless George, and The Unlovables.

==Controversy==
Joe Queer has been publicly outspoken against Nazism and white supremacy over the years as expressed in various interviews and in the song &quot;You&#x27;re Tripping&quot; from the 1993 Lookout Records release &quot;Love Songs for the Retarded&quot;. The lyrics state &quot;I hate white power... Can&#x27;t you see, this ain&#x27;t Nazi Germany&quot;.

In a 2014 open letter, Joe Steinhardt of Don Giovanni Records called on Asian Man Records and Recess Records to drop the Queers after Joe Queer made public statements in support of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Artist Mitch Clem, who had previously done work for the band, publicly broke ties as well. Steinhardt later apologized for the open letter, stating &quot;I remain personally appalled by Joe Queer&#x27;s defense of Darren Wilson, his use of the term Obongo regarding the president...at the same time, I recognize that a better way to go about this would be more thoughtful discussion directly with the people involved.&quot; Joe Queer later called Steinhardt a &#x27;gutless wimp&#x27; and challenged him to a face to face debate to be filmed and put online. Steinhardt has yet to respond.

In an interview with Noisey, after their February 2016 show was cancelled due to a call for a petition to boycott the show from a local collective, Babely Shades, Joe Queer voiced his opinion when asked if he &quot;supports racist, misogynistic or homophobic values?&quot; he replied &quot;Of course not. What normal minded person does? My closest pals here in Atlanta are Chris and Chester, two gay black guys. I was actually working a part time job. I was one of two white people on the whole job. If I was so racist, I wouldn&#x27;t have worked there or be living in Atlanta! The whole city is predominantly black.&quot; 

Queer also voiced his opinion of the activist group Black Lives Matter, stating &quot;Black Lives Matter doesn&#x27;t care about black people, they just want to cause trouble and hate white people. If they truly cared they&#x27;d be in the ghettos of America trying to help there instead of screaming about white America. That&#x27;s where the murders of black people are happening, but according to BLM it&#x27;s all white cops who are doing it! It&#x27;s insane thinking and not getting to the root of the problem at all. All lives matter.&quot;

In a 2017 interview, Joe Queer stated &quot;I get called a Nazi and racist because of our name, and then because I had an opinion about the Ferguson thing,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#x27;m liberal as hell, and I was taken aback by how quickly people attacked me. To this day, I&#x27;ll get snide comments. I was jumped by Nazis as a gay person, even though I&#x27;m not gay. I fought Nazis, so to be called a Nazi is lame by this alt-left.&quot; In the same interview he states that humor is a way to social change, we shouldn&#x27;t take ourselves so seriously and that many people are looking for a reason to be offended. &quot;In the old days of punk rock, all these bands were laughing at themselves, and they got their point across through humor,&quot; King says. &quot;The Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, the Dickies, the Angry Samoans, Flipper, X — they were funny, but they had a message. They were laughing at themselves. I don&#x27;t think the new liberals are really offended. I think they&#x27;re just looking for a reason to say they&#x27;re offended. They completely take everything out of context. It&#x27;s so insincere, this faux outrage.&quot;

==Members==
Since its formation, the band has gone through a few line-up changes, with Joe Queer as the only constant member. The band currently consists of Joe Queer (guitar/vocals), Ginger Fanculo (bass), and Hoglog Rehab (drums). The first line-up was Joe Queer, Tulu, Keith Hages and Wimpy Rutherford. The mid-1980s line-up was Joe Queer, JJ Rassler, Hugh O&#x27;Neill with Kevin Kecy or Evan Shore. The best-known line-up is from the 1990s Lookout Records era: Joe Queer, B-Face and Hugh O&#x27;Neill. After leaving Lookout Records, B-Face and Hugh O&#x27;Neill left and Dangerous Dave joined. The Queers continue to actively tour and a new record is in the works. In 1999, former drummer Hugh O&#x27;Neill died of brain cancer at the age of 41.

<text>Superfrog is a scrolling 2D platform game, originally developed for the Amiga and published in 1993 by Team17. Later releases were handled by Ocean Software and GOG.com.

== Gameplay ==
The objective of the game is to find and defeat a witch, thus rescuing a princess, whilst achieving smaller objectives throughout the game, such as finding a golden key or escaping from captivity in a circus.

There are 24 regular levels, divided into six differently-themed worlds. The goal of each level is to collect a set number of coins, and then reach the exit, which will only open if Superfrog has collected enough coins. Extra factors of gameplay include a timer countdown and a number of health points, both of which can be restored by finding bottles of Lucozade among the levels.

Depending on the number of coins and fruit collected, and on how fast the player finishes the level, a number of credits (up to a maximum of 15) are awarded at the end of each level. The player can then choose to either collect the credits for a score or gamble them in a slot machine-style minigame for more bonuses. The most important function of the slot machine minigame is the chance to win a level code, enabling the player to restart the game from the beginning of the next level at a later time.

An extra level between world 5 and 6 takes the form of a side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up called &quot;Project-F&quot; in homage to Team17&#x27;s own &quot;Project-X&quot; (even going as far as using a remixed version of the original game&#x27;s theme tune). Rather than collecting coins, the objective of this stage is to survive to the end. This level was omitted from the PC conversion of the game. After completing all six worlds, the game ends with a small boss fight against the witch in a castle setting.

==Plot==
The story, present in the game&#x27;s manual but mostly conveyed through the introductory animation by Eric W. Schwartz, concerns an unnamed prince, who is turned into a frog by a jealous witch, in homage to the Frog Prince fairy tale. His princess girlfriend is then abducted by the same witch. Subsequently, sulking by the &quot;River O&#x27; Despair&quot;, the prince chances upon a floating bottle of Lucozade, which confers upon him super powers. With his new powers, the prince heads off to fight the evil witch and save the princess.

==Development==
&quot;Superfrog&quot; was developed in 1993 and released for the Amiga in the same year by Team17, acting simultaneously as developer and publisher. The release was popular enough to spawn an Amiga CD32 version, which could also be played on some Amiga computers fitted with a CD drive. Due to its enduring popularity, it was then converted for the PC by Bubball Systems in 1994, running as an MS-DOS program. Eric W. Schwartz provided the animation for the introduction. The Amiga version was re-released by Islona Software in 1999, with slightly different box art. In 2012, &quot;Superfrog&quot; was, along with other games by Team17, released as a legitimate digital download from GoodOldGames.com, this version being the first compatible with Windows.

== Reception ==

Team17&#x27;s earlier games became relatively obscure after the release of the hugely popular &quot;Worms&quot; series, though many gamers remember &quot;Superfrog&quot; fondly for its solid gameplay, smooth scrolling, cartoon-quality graphics, and upbeat music by composer Allister Brimble. Although a relatively small release by the standards of blockbuster platformers like &quot;Sonic&quot;, it was well received and has retained a fan base which considers it an excellent example of the genre.

==Rerelease==
An HD version of the game, &quot;Superfrog HD&quot;, was co-developed by both Team17 and TickTockGames, formerly Bubball Systems, the company initially responsible for the MS-DOS port of &quot;Superfrog&quot; in 1994. It was released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, then later for Microsoft Windows via Steam, OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS.

In May 2016, &quot;Superfrog HD&quot; was discontinued by Team17; due to low sales and negative reception, the game was removed from PSN, Steam, App Store and Google Play. At the same time, the original &quot;Superfrog&quot; game was removed from GOG.com.

<doc id="857298" wikidata="Q1338889" url="?curid=857298" title="The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)">
<text>The Heartbreak Kid is a 1972 American romantic black comedy film directed by Elaine May and written by Neil Simon, starring Charles Grodin, Cybill Shepherd, Jeannie Berlin, Audra Lindley, Eddie Albert, and Doris Roberts. It is based on the short story &quot;A Change of Plan&quot;, written by Bruce Jay Friedman and first published in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1966.

In the film, a self-absorbed salesman (Grodin) marries his girlfriend (Berlin) after a short courtship. During his honeymoon, the salesman increasingly tires of his bride, finding that her earlier habits during courtship now irritate and repel him. Before the end of the honeymoon the salesman falls for a college-aged heiress (Shepherd) and impulsively courts her against her father&#x27;s (Albert) wishes.

At the 45th Academy Awards, Berlin was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and Albert for Best Supporting Actor. &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; was ranked number 91 on AFI&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Laughs&quot;, a list of the funniest American films ever made, and was remade in 2007.

==Plot==

In New York City, after a short courtship, emotionally shallow, self-absorbed Lenny Cantrow, a sporting goods salesman, is married to Lila, an earnest young woman who expects long-term emotional commitment from Lenny.

During their honeymoon in Miami Beach, Lenny meets and pursues the beautiful but shallow Kelly Corcoran, a college student on holiday with her wealthy parents. When Lila is severely sunburned, Lenny quarantines her to their hotel room while he engages in a series of rendezvous with Kelly, lying to Lila about his whereabouts and making outlandish stories to explain why he was late. Lenny tells Kelly that she is the woman he has been &quot;waiting for&quot; all of his life, and that he just &quot;timed it wrong&quot;. After meeting with Kelly several times over the course of only three days, Lenny impulsively ends his marriage in order to pursue an indifferent Kelly, leaving Lila heartbroken after only five days of marriage.

Lenny follows Kelly to her parents&#x27; home in Minnesota, where he tells Kelly he wants to marry her, to which Kelly responds that she is flattered and already has a boyfriend. A little later in Lenny&#x27;s car, the two kiss. Lenny continues trying to impress Kelly, but her resentful and protective father stands in his way. Following an awkward dinner where Lenny inanely praises Midwestern produce as having &quot;no deceit&quot;, Mr. Corcoran tells Lenny he sees through his ploy, and offers him a $25,000 bribe to leave. Lenny angrily refuses and soon marries Kelly.

At the reception, Lenny engages in fairly mindless conversation with several of the guests, one of whom owns a company that manufactures tear gas, which Lenny says there is a lot of money in. He is reduced to quoting cliches to two uncomprehending children and is left alone as the party continues around him.

==Cast==
==Production==
Bristol Myers Squibb (Palomar Pictures International) owns the rights to &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; (1972) and &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972).&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/2001/video-programming&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The film is a black comedy, examining love and hypocrisy through a lens of pointed, subtle humor. Though it contains broad jokes, occasionally going for &quot;laughs without shame&quot;, Elaine May is credited with emotionally grounding the film and providing &quot;a real understanding of character&quot; through eliciting the kind of &quot;caustic, almost powerful humor that comes from moments of wincing recognition when human foibles are accurately captured and revealed&quot;. As another reviewer wrote in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, May&#x27;s strength lies in her &quot;obsessive and affectionate observations of character&quot;.

May shared with her late comedy partner Mike Nichols (1931–2014) a sparse, dialogue-oriented style and a quizzical perspective. She places an emphasis on character comedy; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented on her stylistic decisions to derive humor &quot;from situations rather than obvious one-line jokes&quot; and make comedic choices which &quot;flow effortlessly from rhythmic dialogue, explosions of laughter&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Pauline Kael wrote: &quot;Elaine May has the rarest kind of comic gift: the ability to create a world seen comically&quot;.

May&#x27;s focus on comedic honesty, backlit by pain and misfortune, stylistically influenced a new generation of films. She helped push comedy into a &quot;golden age as the result of the rise of the semi-surreal comedy of mishap, pain, insult, and desperation&quot;.

== Themes ==
=== Love and Jewish identity ===
&quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; is a particularly Jewish story, with &quot;The Village Voice&quot; calling it &quot;the culminating work of Hollywood&#x27;s Jewish new wave&quot;. All the filmmakers are Jewish: Friedman, Simon, May, the producer Edgar J. Scherick, and the composers Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The story follows Lenny Cantrow, the embodiment of the Jewish archetype of the &quot;schlemiel&quot; (bungler), as he dumps Lila (Jeannie Berlin), a &quot;kvetchy Jew&quot; and &quot;sloppy, incipient yenta&quot;, for the girl of his dreams, an all-American WASP. The film is a deadpan fever dream of shiksa-chasing, taking place in what Bruce Jay Friedman dubs in the original short story as the land of &quot;strange blonde people&quot;.

The character of Lila in particular has been labelled extremely stereotypical; &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; likened her to a female Portnoy, publishing a review stating: &quot;Philip Roth&#x27;s friendly anti-Semitism is strikingly similar to Friedman&#x27;s&quot;. Some critics have expressed concerns that the movie forwards a stilted vision of the modern female Jew and implicitly asks the question: &quot;Why be married to a cloying, unsophisticated, slightly overweight Jewish girl who speaks with a discernible sing-song Jewish intonation (&quot;Yiddish influence&quot;) when you can perhaps conquer a very Waspy-looking, knockout blonde shiksa type?&quot; This is despite the intentions of Jeannie Berlin, who told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she did her best to honor the character and give Lila depth: &quot;You see, I didn&#x27;t want to make that girl stupid. It would have been so easy to do Lila stupid. I don&#x27;t think Lila was stupid. I think every single thing she did was justified to her... And she really was terrifically in love&quot;. For the role of Lila, Simon wanted Diane Keaton, but May thought the intended contrast between Jewish and gentile wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough.

Lenny&#x27;s behavior as a classic nebbish Jew is thoughtless, as he leaves Lila high and dry on their honeymoon. Charles Grodin said afterwards that although he played the character with full sincerity, he had &quot;pretty much indelibly stamped [himself] into the moviegoing public&#x27;s consciousness as a jerk&quot;. Still, he said, many viewers misread the film as an illustration of precisely Jewish annoyances, and not as critique: &quot;The number of men who tell me how much they loved the movie and how much they identified with the character, while flattering, is also somewhat frightening&quot;.

The final moments of the film depict Lenny failing to communicate with Kelly&#x27;s gentile family. It highlights how he gave up his personal cultural traditions, and how he misses them. Having walked down the aisle to Kelly as a large cross hung overhead, Lenny sits on the couch by himself, swimming in a sea of midwestern Christianity, as listless and alienated as ever.

==Reception==
The film has received almost universal praise from critics. As of 2024, the film had an approval rating of 92% at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews, with an average score of 7.60/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;An uproariously funny confluence of top-shelf talent, &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; finds bittersweet humor in attitudes toward love and marriage in early &#x27;70s America.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it to be &quot;a first-class American comedy, as startling in its way as was &quot;The Graduate&quot;&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 in a review that concludes: &quot;It&#x27;s a comedy, but there&#x27;s more in it than that; it&#x27;s a movie about the ways we pursue, possess, and consume each other as sad commodities&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the same 3.5/4 grade and wrote that &quot;the heavy-handed comedy undermines the serious aspect of the movie—we really can&#x27;t believe that Lenny would marry her in the first place. The overall high quality of the acting, however, does sustain the film&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;bright, amusing saga&quot; until the &quot;audience is jolted by a sudden shut-off ending with no climax whatsoever&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Grodin and Berlin &quot;bring off hugely difficult comedy assignment with great style. Amidst increasing farcical events, they both somehow manage to preserve a sense of credible, foolish but sympathetic individuals lurking beneath the follies&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought that the film &quot;has its faults, but it&#x27;s also one of the most entertaining and original American film comedies of the last few years&quot;. &quot;The Independent Film Journal&quot; called it an &quot;unquestionably brilliant comedy&quot;. Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars out of four, and described it as &quot;Either hilarious or horrifying, depending on your point of view; directed for maximum impact by May.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; noted in its review that the sudden ending of the film might have been indicative of another ending that had been planned, and later noted that Fox handed out a synopsis at screenings including an ending where &quot;as they sail for Europe on their honeymoon, Lenny makes some startling discoveries about Kelly - and &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; comes to its bitingly funny end&quot;.

==Accolades==
===American Film Institute===
In 2000, the film was ranked 91st in the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list.

==Home media==
Although released on DVD in 1998 and in 2002, the film currently (as of 2022) is out of print. In 2022 it was announced the Brooklyn Academy of Music would offer a rare screening of the film.

==Remake==
A remake of the film was released in 2007 that stars Ben Stiller, Michelle Monaghan, Malin Åkerman, Jerry Stiller, Rob Corddry, Carlos Mencia, Scott Wilson, and Danny McBride.

<doc id="857300" wikidata="Q1752752" url="?curid=857300" title="Battle of Mbwila">
<text>Battle of Mbwila (also the Battle of Ambuila, Battle of Mbuila, or Battle of Ulanga) occurred on 29 October 1665 in which Portuguese forces defeated the forces of the Kingdom of Kongo and decapitated king António I of Kongo, also called Nvita a Nkanga.

==Origins of the war==
Although Kongo and Portugal had been trading partners and participated in a cultural exchange during the sixteenth century, the establishment of the Portuguese colony of Angola in 1575 put pressure on that relationship. Kongo initially assisted Portugal in Angola, sending an army to rescue the Portuguese governor Paulo Dias de Novais when his war against the nearby African kingdom of Ndongo failed in 1579. But subsequently as Portugal became stronger it began to press harder, and in 1622 severed even the cautiously friendly relationship of the earlier period when a large Portuguese army invaded southern Kongo and defeated the local forces at the Battle of Mbumbi. Pedro II, king of Kongo at the time, responded by personally leading a force at the battle of Mbanda crushing the invasion. He then wrote to the Dutch Estates General, proposing an alliance with the Dutch to drive the Portuguese out of Angola altogether. This alliance did not finally come to fruition until 1641 when Dutch forces took Luanda and were joined by an army from Kongo, forcing the Portuguese to withdraw into the interior. However, they were not able to finish the Portuguese, and as a result the Portuguese eventually forced the Dutch out in 1648.

In the years following the Dutch withdrawal, Angolan governors sought to obtain revenge against Kongo and to support the slave trade with a highly aggressive policy. Included in this policy were attacks on the zone of small, semi-independent states called Dembos that separated Angola from Kongo. Both Kongo and Angola claimed authority over the Dembos. King António I, an aggressive monarch in his own right, was negotiating with Spain to renew an anti-Portuguese alliance, and also sent ambassadors into the Dembos areas to persuade them to join Kongo against the Portuguese, promising Spanish aid. In 1665, one of these small kingdoms, Mbwila, underwent a succession struggle and the various factions appealed to Kongo and Angola for aid. Both sides responded with armies.

==Battle==
The core of the Portuguese force, commanded by Luís Lopes de Sequeira, was 450 musketeers and two light artillery pieces. There were soldiers from the Portuguese colony of Brazil, including some of African and Native American origin, as well as Imbangala and other African forces numbering about 15,000. The Kongo army included a large number of peasant archers, probably about 15,000, some 5,000 heavy infantry equipped with shields and swords, and a musket regiment of 380 men, 29 of them Portuguese led by Pedro Dias de Cabral.

Both armies were operating at some distance from their main bases. They had marched for days to reach the battlefield, along the valley of the Ulanga River just south of the capital of Mbwila. Steep hills and the river defined the east side of the battlefield, and lower ridges the west. The Portuguese forces took up positions between the two, with their African forces deployed on the flanks and the musketeers forming a diamond-shaped formation in the center, anchored by their artillery. The Imbangala forces were held in reserve.

António&#x27;s army advanced into the Portuguese formation with a vanguard, followed by three divisions of his heavy infantry and the archers on the flanks. The Duke of Bengo commanded the reserve. In the initial stages of the battle, the Kongolese archers swept most of the African archers of the Portuguese forces from the field and then launched attacks against the Portuguese musketeers, supported by their own heavy infantry and musketeers. In spite of heavy fighting, the Kongolese were unable to break the Portuguese formation and António was killed in the final attempt. Most of the Kongo forces broke following the king&#x27;s death. The survivors were only able to withdraw thanks to skillful rearguard action by the Duke of Bengo and the reserves.

More than 400 of Kongo&#x27;s heavy infantry were killed in the encounter and many more of the archers. Along with these losses was the royal chaplain, the mixed-race Capuchin priest Francisco de São Salvador (Manuel Robrerdo in secular life). King António&#x27;s young son of seven years was captured.
After the battle, the head of the king or Manikongo was buried with ceremony by the Portuguese in the chapel of Our Lady of Nazareth situated on the Bay of Luanda, and the crown and sceptre of Kongo were sent to Lisbon as trophies.

==Aftermath==

Portugal obtained an act of vassalage from D. Isabel, the regent of Mbwila, but was unable to exercise any real authority over the region once their forces had withdrawn. In 1693 they had to return to attempt to subdue the region again. The primary result in Kongo was that the absence of an immediate heir spun the country into civil war. This civil war, which raged for half a century, led to Kongo&#x27;s decentralization and fundamental changes, leading to Kongolese historians, even in 1700, regarding the battle as a decisive turning point in their country&#x27;s history.

After the battle many people, including nobles and members of the royal family, were captured. Some of these were enslaved and crossed the sea to the Portuguese colony of Brazil and maybe other places in the Americas. It is unknown what happened to most of them. But at some point before 1670, the sons of princess Aqualtune (who led a battalion during the battle), Ganga Zumba, his brother Ganga Zona, and their sister Sabina appeared enslaved in an &quot;engenho&quot; (sugar cane plantation) in the Captaincy of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. They led a rebellion at the engenho, escaped, and later formed their own kingdom of Quilombo dos Palmares, a Maroon nation which controlled large areas of northeast Brazil during the Dutch-Portuguese War.

Sabina bore a son Zumbi who, after being captured, was raised in a church and then escaped. Zumbi succeeded his uncle and became the king of Palmares and leader of the rebellion until being killed in 1695 by the Bandeirantes, after which the kingdom was destroyed. His son Camuanga succeeded him in leadership of the rebellion, but after this it is unknown what happened to them or their lineage. Zumbi today is considered a national hero in Brazil.

<text>Molesworth Station is a high country cattle station. It is located behind the Inland Kaikōura Mountain range in the South Island&#x27;s Marlborough District. It is New Zealand&#x27;s largest farm, at over and supports the country&#x27;s biggest herd of cattle. It also hosts government science programs, such as research into bovine tuberculosis and related research into possums. The station helps rabbit population reduction.

The present station was formed in 1949 when a third station, St Helens, was added to Tarndale and Molesworth stations which had been amalgamated in 1938 after the runholders &quot;walked off&quot; the land. The three stations had once run around 95,000 head of sheep. The land was brought back into production by a major investment in rabbit control followed by revegetation of the barren ground. Cattle replaced the sheep.

The land is owned by the Crown and is leased for farming. On 1 July 2005, administration of the land was handed to the New Zealand Department of Conservation.

The HVDC Inter-Island transmission line passes through the station.

==Molesworth Station==
===Livestock and their managers===
Molesworth is a high country cattle station. Its Angus and Angus/Hereford-cross cattle range free on the high country in summer months and graze in the warmer valleys during winter. They are cared for by a team of stockmen camping with their dogs and horses in remote huts. Each October/November they achieve a calving rate of 92 per cent. The calves are weaned just before their mothers drop their next calf. Surplus heifers are sold as two-year-olds and steers as three-year-olds.

Permanent staff is five and another half-dozen stockmen are employed except in winter. During the most active periods there are around 80 horses and up to 45 working dogs working on the station. Molesworth uses aircraft to find cattle at mustering and to pick up any missed by the muster.

===Weeds pests and diseases===
Weed control is expensive. Briar, broom and wilding pine and the flatweed, hieracium. Possums and ferrets can transmit bovine tuberculosis

==Climate==

==Tourism==
There are restrictions in place to protect the working farm. Bad weather may also close some other areas.

Molesworth Recreation Reserve (&#x27;Molesworth Station&#x27;) is located NW of Kaikōura. It is accessible from Hanmer Springs in the south, Seddon in the north east, and St Arnaud in the north.

The primary route through Molesworth is the Acheron road, from Hanmer Springs to Seddon. This is the only route suitable for 2WD vehicles. Caravans, trailers, buses, and vehicles over 7m length are not permitted. The road is a single track for the most part. The road is unsealed but there are no fords, and the gradients are not steep. The road is approximately 200 km, with a maximum speed of 50 km/h, though practical road speeds are lower making for at least a 6hr journey.

===Hanmer Springs to Acheron Accommodation House===
Two different routes are available for this section. Jacks Pass, and Jollies Pass which is poorly maintained and requires 4WD.

===Acheron Accommodation House===
This is an historic house, and no accommodation is now provided. However simple camping facilities are available. The house itself is a cob construction. 
===Acheron valley===
The road follows the Acheron river for much of the route through Molesworth. In places the river runs in a gorge, and there are a number of historic bridges. The scenery is open grassland for the most part. 

===Isolated Flat ===
Travelling north, the road departs from the Acheron river to briefly follow the Severn river, then over the Isolated Saddle about 100m above the plain. It then descends again to the Isolated Flat, and again follows the Acheron river. 
===Wards Pass===
Leaving the Acheron River, the road goes over Wards Pass, a climb of about 160 m, which brings the route into the upper reaches of the Awatere valley.

===Molesworth Homestead===
The historic homestead and the modern farm yards are located to the north of the Reserve. There is also a simple camp site here. 
===Awatere Valley===
Leaving Molesworth station, the road continues through farmland in the Awatere valley. In the higher reaches the valley is narrow and the farming primarily stock (sheep and beef), but in the lower reaches towards Seddon it broadens and more cultivation becomes apparent including vineyards.

<doc id="857305" wikidata="Q13424846" url="?curid=857305" title="Cyclo-cross bicycle">
<text>A cyclo-cross bike or cyclo-cross bicycle (abbreviated CX Bike or CXB) is a bicycle specifically designed for the rigors of a cyclo-cross race. Cyclo-cross bicycles roughly resemble the racing bicycles used in road racing. The major differences between the two are the frame geometry, and the wider clearances that cyclo-cross bikes have for their larger tires and mud and other debris that they accumulate.

Cyclists have been competing in races on road-going bicycles since the 19th century. Cyclo-cross emerged as a sport in its own right in France in 1902. Cyclo-cross bicycles are similar to other bicycles, but the frame geometry is closer to a mountain bike than a road racing bicycle. The top tube is often longer and closer to horizontal, and the handlebars are higher, again akin to mountain bikes. The emphasis on bicycle handling skills differentiates cyclo-cross from road racing. Cyclo-cross courses are held on a variety of terrain, including grass, mud, sand and paved surfaces.

== History ==
There are many stories about the origins of cyclo-cross - and so about the origin of cyclo-cross bikes. What can be assumed to be certain is that the cyclo-cross bikes are a further development of normal racing bikes, which have been adapted to the needs of cyclo-cross sport. Today, they are often described as having a mixture of mountain bike and road bike characteristics, but in fact existed decades before mountain bikes were introduced in the bicycle world.

The first explicit cyclo-cross bicycles appeared in the 1960s, manufactured by European companies from the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. At first the frames were usually made of steel; nowadays, aluminum and carbon fibre are more common, at least in regard to cyclo-cross bikes built for racing.

== Characteristics ==

===Frame design===
Frame materials are selected with an aim to produce a lightweight, yet stiff and responsive frame. Low weight is prized for ease of carrying while running. Cyclo-cross racers may lift or carry their bikes as many as 30 times in one 60 minute race, increasing the desire for a lightweight bicycle. Aluminum frames were popular in cyclo-cross bicycles long before they became commonplace on the road. Today the most popular material is aluminium with carbon fiber being popular at a professional level.

Cyclo-cross frames require clearance for slightly wider (generally 30–34 mm) tires and the debris and mud that is picked up by them. They are typically very simple, often eschewing bridges between the rear stays. Compact geometry frames with sloping top tubes are less common than on road bicycles due to the need to carry the bicycle easily on the shoulder. Top tube (rather than bottom bracket) routed derailleur cables help combat the build-up of mud. Some specialist cyclo-cross bikes also have a higher bottom bracket to aid clearance over rough ground; extra clearance could prevent toe clips from dragging while re-mounting after an obstacle. This is less common as clipless pedals have become the norm for cyclo-cross.

Typically, the frame geometry is somewhat more relaxed than that of a road bike, not as upright in the seat tube, which allows for more stability in soft ground. Also, the wheelbase can be a bit longer, which provides a more planted feeling when using aft body weighting over rough terrain, and can help keep the rider&#x27;s feet from contacting the front wheel during a tight turn.

===Components===
Choices of equipment tend more towards the idiosyncratic than in road racing; for example single-speed bicycles also have some popularity due to the advantage of mechanical simplicity in the often very muddy conditions and the fringe nature of the sport. Gearing is typically lower, with most common setups using a 46-36 (110mm BCD) or 48-38 (130mm BCD) chainring combination with a 12-25 to 12-30 cassette. Some riders opt to use a single chainring in the front (typically a 40-42 tooth chainring) while retaining multiple sprockets in the rear cassette. This has some of the advantages of the single-speed: the weight of the front derailleur and the front shift lever are lost, a single chainring allows for a tighter chainline, thus reducing the chance of throwing a chain on a bumpy course, and further, racing is psychologically simpler.

Wheels are of the normal road racing type fitted with knobby tires (a variety of tread designs in both tubular and clincher types are available), although deeper rim profiles may be preferred for their advantages in thick mud. There are slight geometry differences between road and cyclocross bicycles; cyclo-cross bikes tend to have slightly higher handlebars for a more upright position as aerodynamics have little importance in a cross race. A second set of brake levers on the tops, called &quot;top mount&quot; or &quot;interrupter&quot; brake levers, are favored by some competitors. These are also commonly called &quot;cross levers&quot; due to their popularity in the sport. The top tubes of cyclocross bike frames typically have an ovalized or flattened bottom profile to provide greater comfort when riders need to shoulder and carry their bikes. In general, with a change of tires and gearing a cyclo-cross bike can double as a perfectly adequate road racing machine. However, most cyclo-cross racers prefer clipless mountain bike pedals for their easy dual-sided entry and mud-shedding abilities. Additionally, mountain biking shoes provide better traction while running than typical road style shoes thanks to flexibility in the sole and pronounced tread patterns, and may even be fitted with two screw-threaded studs of the same type traditionally used on soccer boots. 
Cyclocross cantilever brake bosses are more often equipped with traditional center-pull cantilever brakes than the more contemporary and powerful linear-pull brakes (&quot;V-brakes&quot;) due to two reasons: native compatibility (insufficient brake cable pull) with the majority of drop-bar brake levers; and the cantilever brake&#x27;s greater brake pad-to-rim clearance, which minimizes drag in muddy conditions. &quot;Mini-V&#x27;s&quot; are gaining in popularity as they have both the native cable pull, and some of the increased power of traditional linear-pull brakes over cantilever brakes.

Since the lifting of the UCI ban on disc brake use in cyclocross racing, bike component and frame manufacturers have immediately started developing and testing race-level cyclocross bikes equipped with disc brakes. While disc brakes are heavier than cantilever brakes, the trade off is that they allow for later and significantly more powerful braking in racing conditions.

===Tires===

Tire choice is very important in cyclo-cross racing. Off-road tubular tires are still very popular; even more so than in road racing. This is, in part, due to their ability to be used at low pressure around 1.5-2.75 bar (22-40 psi) without increasing the risk of pinch flats. Low pressure is desirable because it increases contact patch area which can increase traction on soft surfaces. This increases the risk of the rim bottoming out on the ground, however, and this is a problem with clincher tires because the tube can be pinched by the rim, causing a flat. With tubular tires, this is not a problem, as they cannot pinch flat. The only concern is damage to the rim. Tubular tires also offer a weight saving and the ability to be ridden on even when flat so that a racer can reach the pits for a replacement.

Clinchers do have their advantages. Changing tires is much quicker since it does not involve a lengthy glueing and curing process so a rider can have a large selection of tires at their disposal. Until recently, clinchers also generally had more cutting edge tread patterns than the more traditional tubulars. Some enthusiasts even went as far as to send Michelin Mud tires (a popular clincher tire) to Dugast (a manufacturer of high end tubular tires) to have a modern tread pattern incorporated into a traditional tubular. However, since 2005 several tubular manufacturers have designed more modern style tread patterns, namely Dugast with its Rhino, Tufo with its Flexus and Challenge with its Grifo and Fango. Lastly, clincher tires generally cost less than tubulars.

Because cyclo-cross season spans autumn/fall and winter, course conditions can vary quite drastically. Often racers have at least dry and wet weather tires to choose between. Dry tires tend to have much smaller, closely spaced tread such as the diamond pattern for low rolling resistance. Wet weather tires have larger and more widely spaced knobs to aid in grip and mud shedding. Tires do not usually vary in width a great deal due to the theory that a narrow tire has the least rolling resistance (for dry courses) and that it will also cut through mud to the harder ground underneath (for wet/muddy courses). Although widths below 30c (denoting the tire width in millimeters) were popular in the past, current tires tend to be available from 30-35c with 32 and 34 being the most common.

==Equipment choice==

Because ground conditions can vary greatly, equipment choice is extremely important. Add to this the fact that the races are relatively short and that equipment changes are allowed during races and equipment selection can get fanatical. Since tubular tires are popular in professional and some amateur racing and tires cannot easily be removed from the rim, collections of wheels with tires installed, are required for the varying conditions. It is common for racers even at an amateur level to have a pair of race bikes (one to ride and one in the pits as a back-up) and several wheels to choose from. At the professional level it is essential to have several bikes and wheel options available.

More recently, tubeless clincher tires have become popular after their successful presence on mountain bikes for the last several years. Advantages include lower overall wheel weight (no inner tube), lower tire pressures allowing for more traction without risk of a &#x27;pinch flat&#x27; and no glue as required for tubular tires. Not all clincher rim designs allow for tubeless tires as an air tight contact surface is required to prevent the unintended loss of tire pressure.

==Rules==
The following are rules that have been put in place by the UCI that are either specific to or have particular effect on cyclo-cross bicycles. These rules are not exhaustive, are only for UCI-sanctioned events and may not be enforced at all cyclo-cross events.

*Handlebars must not measure more than in width.
*Tire width may not exceed and tires may not feature any kind of studs or spikes.
*Wheels shall have at least 12 spokes.
*The weight of the bicycle cannot be less than 6.8 kilograms (15 lb to two significant figures).

As of 2010, disc brakes have recently been allowed for UCI races.

==Non-racing use==
Some cyclocross bicycles available in the consumer market are supplied with disc brakes as a stock item. Some models include braze-ons to enable the use of cantilever style brakes instead. The growing popularity of disc brakes on cyclocross bicycles has allowed for improved and lighter rim designs due to a lack of brake track on the side of the rim.

==Mountain bikes in cyclocross racing==
In some countries (including the United States, so long as it is not a UCI event) riders are also permitted to race in cyclo-cross events using mountain bikes (generally without bar ends), at least in low-level competition, but this is not currently allowed in events on the international calendar. It has been known for local races to be won on mountain bikes, particularly if the course is technical with little road or fast sections. However, for a traditional cyclo-cross course, a cyclo-cross bicycle is the most effective.

<text>Victory gardens, also called war gardens or food gardens for defense, were vegetable, fruit, and herb gardens planted at private residences and public parks in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Germany during World War I and World War II. In wartime, governments encouraged people to plant victory gardens not only to supplement their rations but also to boost morale. They were used along with rationing stamps and cards to reduce pressure on the food supply. Besides indirectly aiding the war effort, these gardens were also considered a civil &quot;morale booster&quot; in that gardeners could feel empowered by their contribution of labor and rewarded by the produce grown. This made victory gardens a part of daily life on the home front.

==World War I==

===Canada ===

Victory Gardens became popular in Canada in 1917. Under the Ministry of Agriculture&#x27;s campaign, &quot;A Vegetable Garden for Every Home&quot;, residents of cities, towns and villages utilized backyard spaces to plant vegetables for personal use and war effort. In the city of Toronto, women&#x27;s organizations brought expert gardeners into the schools to get school children and their families interested in gardening. In addition to gardening, homeowners were encouraged to keep hens in their yards to obtain eggs. The result was a large production of potatoes, beets, cabbage, and other useful vegetables.

===United States===

In March 1917, Charles Lathrop Pack organized the US National War Garden Commission and launched the war garden campaign. Food production had fallen dramatically during World War I, especially in Europe, where agricultural labor had been recruited into military service and remaining farms had been devastated by the conflict. Pack and others conceived the idea that the supply of food could be greatly increased without the use of land and manpower already engaged in agriculture, and without the significant use of transportation facilities needed for the war effort. The campaign promoted the cultivation of available private and public lands, resulting in over five million gardens in the U.S. The Food Administrator, Herbert Hoover, had the ambitious goal of sending 20 million tons of food to the war front by July 1919, although this number was reduced to 4 million in actuality. The campaign was a huge success, leading to foodstuff production exceeding $1.2 billion by the end of the war.

President Woodrow Wilson said that &quot;Food will win the war.&quot; To support the home garden effort, a United States School Garden Army was launched through the Bureau of Education, and funded by the War Department at Wilson&#x27;s direction.

==World War II==


===Australia===
In 1942, Australia&#x27;s prime minister John Curtin launched a &quot;Dig for Victory&quot; campaign as rationing, drought, and a shortage of agricultural workers began to affect food supplies. This encouraged homeowners all over Australia to grow crops to help the war effort. The campaign was well received by the media as well as the large populace, as many Australians were already self-sufficient in growing their own fruits and vegetables. The YWCA created &quot;Garden Army Week&quot; to advertise the newly created &quot;Garden Army&quot; which exclusively supported agriculture and crop production. The situation began to ease in 1943 as fear of invasion lessened; however, home gardens continued throughout the war.

===Britain===
In Britain, &quot;digging for victory&quot; used much land such as waste ground, railway edges, ornamental gardens and lawns, while sports fields and golf courses were requisitioned for farming or vegetable growing. Sometimes a sports field was left as it was but used for sheep-grazing instead of being mown (for example see ). Other schools, like Winchester College contributed their fields to grow vegetables for school consumption, supplementing the meagre soil fertility by raising pigs for their manure. By 1943, the number of allotments had roughly doubled to 1,400,000, including rural, urban and suburban plots. C. H. Middleton&#x27;s radio programme &quot;In Your Garden&quot; reached millions of listeners keen for advice on growing potatoes, leeks and the like, and helped ensure a communal sense of contributing to the war effort (as well as a practical response to food rationing). County Herb Committees were established to collect medicinal herbs when German blockades created shortages, for instance in &quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; (Foxglove) which was used to regulate heartbeat. Victory gardens were planted in backyards and on apartment-building rooftops, with the occasional vacant lot &quot;commandeered for the war effort!&quot; and put to use as a cornfield or a squash patch. During World War II, sections of lawn were publicly plowed for plots in Hyde Park, London to promote the movement, while allotments growing onions in the shadow of the Albert Memorial also pointed to everybody, high and low, chipping in to the national struggle. Both Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle had vegetable gardens planted at the instigation of King George VI to assist with food production. One Londoner reminisced many years later, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t buy artificial fertilisers in those days. But Grandpa kept his plants well-nourished. He swept our chimneys himself and kept the soot for the garden, and he collected lime mortar from bomb sites. Any wood ash was carefully kept, also the lawn mowings, and of course he had the manure and old bedding from the chook and rabbit pens. He made a small wooden cart which he pulled behind his bicycle. He rode round behind the baker, the milkman and the coalman, all of whom made their deliveries by horse and cart, collecting the droppings. Of course the local kids called out after him in the street, and teased me about my &#x27;dirty Grandpa&#x27;. But he ignored them, and I learnt to do the same. He collected leaf-mould in the Autumn to add to the compost pile, which regularly received every scrap of organic waste he could garner. Bones were broken up with a hammer, (but not before they had spent hours in Gran&#x27;s stockpot) and fish bones cut up with old scissors. The vacuum cleaner and the dustpans were always emptied on the heap, as were the teapot and the chamberpots we used at night. All tiny scraps of wool, thread and fabric also went in.&quot;

===United States===
Amid regular rationing of food in Britain, the United States Department of Agriculture encouraged the planting of victory gardens during the course of World War II. Around one third of the vegetables produced by the United States came from victory gardens. It was emphasized to American homefront urbanites and suburbanites that the produce from their gardens would help to lower the price of vegetables needed by the US War Department to feed the troops, thus saving money that could be spent elsewhere on the military: &quot;Our food is fighting&quot;, one US poster read. By May 1943, there were 18 million victory gardens in the United States – 12 million in cities and 6 million on farms.

Eleanor Roosevelt planted a Victory Garden on the White House lawn in 1943. The Roosevelts were not the first presidency to institute a garden in the White House. Woodrow Wilson grazed sheep on the south lawn during World War I to avoid mowing the lawn. Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s garden instead served as a political message of the patriotic duty to garden, even though Eleanor did not tend to her own garden. While Victory Gardens were portrayed as a patriotic duty, 54% of Americans polled said they grew gardens for economic reasons while only 20% mentioned patriotism.

Although at first the Department of Agriculture objected to Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s institution of a victory garden on the White House grounds, fearing that such a movement would hurt the food industry, basic information about gardening appeared in public services booklets distributed by the Department of Agriculture, as well as by agribusiness corporations such as International Harvester and Beech-Nut. Fruit and vegetables harvested in these home and community plots was estimated to be in 1944, an amount equal to all commercial production of fresh vegetables.

The Victory Garden movement also attempted to unite the home front. Local communities would have festivals and competitions to showcase the produce people grew in their own gardens. While the garden movement united some local communities, the garden movement separated minorities like African Americans. At harvest shows, separate prizes were awarded to &quot;colored people&quot;, in similar categories, a long-held tradition in Delaware and the deeper South, as well as in Baltimore.

In New York City, the lawns around vacant &quot;Riverside&quot; were devoted to victory gardens, as were portions of San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park. The slogan &quot;grow your own, can your own&quot;, was a slogan that started at the time of the war and referred to families growing and canning their own food in victory gardens.

During the heat of World War II, artist D.H. Bedford created a brochure for the U.S. Department of Agriculture summarizing everything the American populous would need to know about gardening. This was done in order to increase the production of crops from victory gardens, as food shortages on the war front were becoming a real problem. This brochure, &quot;ABC of Victory Gardens&quot;, highlighted the importance of these victory gardens, as well as showing how to properly grow, harvest, and preserve a variety of crops.

In Japanese Internment Camps, government officials encouraged Victory Gardens to promote self-sufficiency and conserve resources. Individuals who were previously farmers before internment began growing vegetable gardens within camp boundaries. The movement toward Victory Gardens did not serve a patriotic purpose for the Japanese people, instead, the gardens supplemented government-issued meals with fresh vegetables and offered edibles reminiscent of home. Additionally, the relocation of Japanese-Americans increased the usage of victory gardens. Many vegetable and fruit farms were Japanese-owned on the West Coast. In preparation for the mass relocation of individuals, United States citizens were encouraged by government agencies, newspapers, and radio stations to utilize urban farming in preparation for a shortage of fresh fruits and vegetables.


==Postwar==
In 1946, with the war over, many British residents did not plant victory gardens, in expectation of greater availability of food. However, shortages remained in the United Kingdom, and rationing remained in place for at least some food items until 1954.

Land at the centre of the Sutton Garden Suburb in Sutton, London was first put to use as a victory garden during World War II; before then it had been used as a recreation ground with tennis courts. The land continued to be used as allotments by local residents for more than 50 years until they were evicted by the then landowner in 1997. The land has since fallen into disuse.

The Fenway Victory Gardens in the Back Bay Fens of Boston, Massachusetts, and the Dowling Community Garden in Minneapolis, Minnesota remain active as the last surviving public examples from World War II. Most plots in the Fenway Victory Gardens now feature flowers instead of vegetables while the Dowling Community Garden retains its focus on vegetables.

Since the turn of the 21st century, interest in victory gardens has grown. A campaign promoting such gardens has sprung up in the form of new victory gardens in public spaces, victory garden websites and blogs, as well as petitions to renew a national campaign for the victory garden and to encourage the re-establishment of a victory garden on the White House lawn. In March 2009, First Lady Michelle Obama planted an &quot;Kitchen Garden&quot; on the White House lawn, the first since Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s, to raise awareness about healthy food.

==Television==
Historical documentary and reality television series such as &quot;The 1940s House&quot;, &quot;Wartime Farm&quot; and the second season of &quot;Coal House&quot; place modern families in a recreated wartime settings, including digging victory gardens.

The WGBH public-television series &quot;The Victory Garden&quot; took the familiar expression to promote composting and intensive cropping for homeowners who wanted to raise some vegetables (and some flowers).

The 1975 sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot; portrays the efforts of Tom and Barbara Good to become self-sufficient in their suburban home, including turning over most of their garden to vegetable production and a chicken coop. Tom explains to his baffled neighbours that &quot;We&#x27;re digging for victory!&quot; despite their protests that &quot;That was during the War...&quot; Much of the early episodes follow the Goods&#x27; struggle to adapt to living from their victory garden.

<text>Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX, mountain bike trials, hardcourt bike polo and cycleball. The (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races.

Bicycle racing is recognised as an Olympic sport. Bicycle races are popular all over the world, especially in Europe. The countries most devoted to bicycle racing include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Other countries with international standing include Australia, Luxembourg, Slovenia, United Kingdom, United States and Colombia.

==History==

The first bicycle race is popularly held to have been a race on the 31 May 1868 at the Parc de , Paris, France. It was won by expatriate Englishman James Moore who rode a wooden bicycle with solid rubber tires. The machine is now on display at the museum in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England.

The was founded on 14 April 1900 by Belgium, the United States, France, Italy, and Switzerland to replace the International Cycling Association, which had been formed in 1892, over a row with Great Britain as well as because of other issues.

Since the rise of the Olympic Movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics, cycling has been a contestant event in every Summer Olympic Games.

==Racing==

===Road bicycle===
Road bicycle racing involve both team and individual competition, and races are contested in various ways. They range from the one-day road race, criterium, and time trial to multi-stage events like the and its sister events which make up cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours.

The races typically take place from spring through to autumn. Many riders from the Northern Hemisphere spend the winter in countries such as Australia to compete or train. Professional races range from the three-week &quot;Grand Tour&quot; stage races such as the , and the to multi-day stage races such as the Tour de Suisse and Tour of California, to single day &quot;Classics&quot; such as the Tour of Flanders and Milan–San Remo. The longest one-day road race sanctioned by USA Cycling is LOTOJA which covers the from Logan, Utah, to Jackson, Wyoming. Criteriums are races based on circuits typically less than a mile in length and sometimes run for a set time (60 min, 90 min, etc.) rather than a specific distance. Criteriums are the most popular form of road racing in North America. In Belgium, kermesses are popular, single-day events of usually over . As well as road races in which all riders start simultaneously, individual time trial and team time trial events are also held on road-based courses.

===Track cycling===
Track cycling has been around since as early as 1870. The riders competed on wooden indoor tracks that closely resembled the modern velodromes of today. Unlike road racing, which is dependent on environmental factors, indoor tracks ensure the sport can be competed all year round.

It encompasses races that take place on banked tracks or velodromes. Events are quite diverse and can range from individual and team pursuits, two-man sprints, to various group and mass start races. Competitors use track bicycles which do not have brakes or freewheels.

===Cyclo-cross===

Cyclo-cross originated as a sport for road racers during the off season, to vary their training during the cold months. Races typically take place in the autumn and winter (the international or World Cup season is September–January) and consist of many laps of a course featuring pavement, wooded trails, grass, steep hills, and obstacles requiring the rider to dismount, carry the bike and remount in one motion. Races for senior categories are generally between 30 minutes and an hour long, the distance varying depending on the conditions. The sport is strongest in traditional road cycling countries such as Belgium (Flanders in particular) and France.

===Mountain bike===
Mountain bike races are held off-road and involve moderate to high degree of technical riding. There are several varieties; the main categories are cross-country, enduro and downhill but also 4X or four-cross racing.

===BMX===

BMX takes place off-road. BMX races are sprints on purpose-built off-road single-lap tracks, typically on single-gear bicycles. Riders navigate a dirt course of jumps and banked and flat corners.

===Cycle speedway===

Cycle speedway is bicycle racing on short outdoor dirt tracks, in length.

===Motor-paced racing===

Motor-paced racing and keirin use motorcycles for pacing, so cyclists achieve higher speeds.

===Gravel racing===
Gravel racing is one of the newest disciplines of bicycle racing, emerging in the 21st century. For example, one of the premiere gravel races, Unbound Gravel, started in 2006. Some precursors to gravel racing in its current form include road races like the Tour of the Battenkill and Boulder–Roubaix (named after Paris–Roubaix) which are road races with gravel sections. The distinguishing features of gravel racing include long distances, often , and mass starts that include all categories of racers, similar to Gran Fondo rides. The bicycles and courses in gravel racing vary widely, from road bicycles with wide tires used on smooth gravel roads to bicycles that are similar to mountain bike used on courses that include technical trails.

===Average speeds===
Speeds achieved on indoor tracks are usually greater than those on roads. Other factors affecting speed are the route profile (flats and hills), wind conditions, temperatures and elevation. At a 2013 event in Mexico, François Pervis achieved an average of with a flying start over . The top average speed over the men&#x27;s time trial at the 2004 Summer Olympics was recorded by Chris Hoy. Average speeds clearly drop with increasing distance, so that over the Cootamundra Annual Classic it is . In the 2010 Paris–Roubaix, Fabian Cancellara set a speed of , while over the Furnace Creek 508, the speed drops dramatically to . For an extreme road distance such as the Race Across America, the average speed of the record holder is , while the Freedom Trail over mountainous terrain in South Africa is at a record speed of .

===Mountain bike trials===
Mountain bike trials is a sport where riders navigate natural and human-made obstacles without putting down their foot, or &quot;dabbing&quot;. It is similar to motorcycle trials. Points are awarded for bike handling skills. The first UCI Trials World Championships took place in 1986.

==Non-racing disciplines==
===Freestyle BMX===
Freestyle BMX is an extreme sport of stunt riding BMX bikes.

===Artistic cycling===
Artistic cycling is a discipline where athletes perform tricks (called exercises) in a format similar to ballet or gymnastics.

===Cycle ball===
Cycle ball, also known as &quot;radball&quot; (from German), is a sport similar to association football played on bicycles. The two people on each team ride a fixed gear bicycle with no brakes or freewheel. The ball is controlled by the bike and the head, except when defending the goal. 

=== Cycle Polo ===
Cycle Polo is a team sports sport that combines elements of traditional horse polo with bicycling and is played on grass. Cycle Polo&#x27;s was included in the 1908 London Olympics as a demonstration sport. The game has become particularly popular in India.

==== Hardcourt Bike Polo ====

Hardcourt Bike Polo is a more popular, fast-paced, and physically demanding variation of Cycle Polo played on hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete. In teams of three, players maneuver their bicycles while using mallets to strike a ball into the opposing team&#x27;s goal. Originating in Seattle in the late 1990s, hardcourt bike polo has since gained a sharp spike in popularity worldwide, with organized leagues and tournaments held in urban centers across the globe.

<text>Jacob Wolfowitz (March 19, 1910 – July 16, 1981) was a Polish-born American Jewish statistician and Shannon Award-winning information theorist. He was the father of former United States Deputy Secretary of Defense and World Bank Group President Paul Wolfowitz.

==Early life and education==
Wolfowitz was born in 1910 in Warsaw, Poland, the son of Helen (Pearlman) and Samuel Wolfowitz. He emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1920. He received a bachelor of science in 1931 from the City College of New York.

==Career==
In the mid-1930s, Wolfowitz began his career as a high school mathematics teacher and continued teaching until 1942 when he received his Ph.D. degree in mathematics from New York University. While a part-time graduate student, Wolfowitz met Abraham Wald, with whom he collaborated in numerous joint papers in the field of mathematical statistics. This collaboration continued until Wald&#x27;s death in an airplane crash in 1950. In 1951, Wolfowitz became a professor of mathematics at Cornell University, where he stayed until 1970. From 1970 to 1978 he was at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He died of a heart attack in Tampa, Florida, where he had become a professor at the University of South Florida after retiring from Illinois.

Wolfowitz&#x27;s main contributions were in the fields of statistical decision theory, non-parametric statistics, sequential analysis, and information theory.

One of his results is the strong converse to Claude Shannon&#x27;s coding theorem. While Shannon could prove only that the block error probability can not become arbitrarily small if the transmission rate is above the channel capacity, Wolfowitz proved that the block error rate actually converges to one. As a consequence, Shannon&#x27;s original result is today termed &quot;the weak theorem&quot; (sometimes also Shannon&#x27;s &quot;conjecture&quot; by some authors).

<doc id="857322" wikidata="Q669059" url="?curid=857322" title="David Carr (American football)">
<text>David Duke Carr (born July 21, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Fresno State Bulldogs and was selected first overall by the Houston Texans in the 2002 NFL draft. Carr also played for the Carolina Panthers, New York Giants, and San Francisco 49ers. With the Giants, Carr was a member of the team that won Super Bowl XLVI over the New England Patriots. He currently serves as the offensive coordinator at Bakersfield Christian High School.

Carr&#x27;s status as a number one draft pick and subsequent career has led to him being considered a draft bust. In 2016, he joined the NFL Network as an analyst.

==Early life==
David Carr attended Valley Oak Elementary School in Fresno, California. He continued on to Clovis Unified&#x27;s Kastner Intermediate School in Fresno, where he proceeded to break a number of California D-I middle school records as quarterback of the Thunderbirds. After moving to Bakersfield, California, Carr attended Stockdale High School.

==College career==
Carr began as the starting quarterback at Fresno State during the 2000 and 2001 seasons after redshirting in 1999. While he was quarterback, the Bulldogs went 7–5 and 11–3. In his senior season the team beat Colorado, Oregon State, and Wisconsin, all members of BCS conferences. There was speculation about whether the Bulldogs would qualify for a BCS bid, something then unheard of for a BCS non-automatic qualifying conference team. They climbed to as high as number 8 in the polls, and Carr was on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. During his collegiate career, Carr completed 565 of 901 passes for 7,849 yards and threw 65 touchdowns versus 22 interceptions. During his senior year, he won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and was a finalist for the 2001 Heisman Trophy, finishing fifth.

On September 1, 2007, the Fresno State Bulldogs retired Carr&#x27;s #8 jersey in his honor. Former Fresno State football player Robbie Rouse (a junior in 2011) was the last player allowed to wear the number.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Houston Texans===

With the first overall pick of the 2002 NFL draft, the Houston Texans, a new expansion team, selected Carr. His professional career began on a productive note. The Texans played their first regular season game on September 8, 2002, defeating the Dallas Cowboys, 19–10, at Houston&#x27;s Reliant Stadium. Houston became just the second expansion team to win its first game. However, Carr was sacked 76 times during that season, which set a league record. He also set the NFL record for fumble recoveries in a single season, recovering 12 of his own. Both records still stand as of 2024. He finished his rookie year of 2002 with 2,592 passing yards, 9 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. He also rushed for 282 yards along with 3 rushing touchdowns. The Texans finished 4–12 in their first franchise year.
In the 2003 season, Carr played 12 games (11 starts) with 2,103 passing yards, 9 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions. He also rushed for 151 yards with 2 rushing touchdowns and was sacked only 15 times. The Texans finished with a record of 5–11 in 2003.

Carr started all 16 games in 2004 being sacked a league-leading 49 times. He passed for 3,531 yards with 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. The Texans finished 7–9 in 2004.

The 2005 season began poorly as the Texans were 1–9 in their first 10 games, and plummeted to a 2–14 record to finish the season. Plagued by injuries and an ineffective offensive line that limited both the running and passing games, Carr still threw for 2,488 yards while being sacked a league-leading 68 times. Despite the drop-off, the Texans exercised an option in Carr&#x27;s contract that extended him for three years.

The Texans finished the 2006 season at 6–10. For the season, Carr posted a completion percentage of 68.9% (a career-high) and tied the then single-game NFL record of 22 consecutive pass completions (against the Buffalo Bills). However, new Texans general manager Rick Smith decided to go in a different direction at quarterback. Thus, the Texans acquired Matt Schaub from the Atlanta Falcons and decided to release Carr, making him a free agent for the first time of his career. He had been sacked a total of 249 times during his tenure in Houston.

===Carolina Panthers===
Carr agreed to terms with the Carolina Panthers on April 6, 2007, signing a two-year, $6.2 million contract. Following an injury to starting quarterback Jake Delhomme, Carr was named the starter. He played in six games (started four games) and had three touchdowns and five interceptions, with a 53.7 completion percentage and a passer rating of 58.3. Carr suffered a back injury during the fifth game of the season (a victory vs. the New Orleans Saints) on a sack by Will Smith, and saw limited action during the remainder of the 2007 season, being replaced by Vinny Testaverde and Matt Moore. He was released on February 27, 2008.

===New York Giants (first stint)===
On March 12, 2008, Carr signed a one-year contract with the New York Giants, reuniting with former Houston offensive coordinator Chris Palmer. Subsequently, the Giants released former backup quarterback Jared Lorenzen. Carr backed up Eli Manning for two seasons. In the 2009 offseason, Carr was re-signed to a one-year, $2 million contract on February 9, 2009. In his first two years with the Giants, Carr saw action in seven games and threw three total touchdown passes.

===San Francisco 49ers===

On March 7, 2010, Carr agreed to terms with the San Francisco 49ers; he served as a backup to Alex Smith. Carr was put into the 49ers Week 7 game against his former team the Carolina Panthers after Smith suffered a shoulder injury. Carr struggled completing only 5 of 13 passes for 67 yards and throwing a crucial interception late in the 4th quarter. He was released by the 49ers on July 28, 2011.

===New York Giants (second stint)===
Carr signed with the Giants on July 31, 2011, as the backup quarterback to starter Eli Manning. Carr received his only Super Bowl ring in the 2011 season after the Giants beat the New England Patriots 21–17 in Super Bowl XLVI. He did not play a single snap during the 2011 regular season. Carr re-signed with the Giants on March 14, 2012, to an additional one-year contract. He was waived by the Giants on August 31, 2013.

===Legacy===
Carr&#x27;s status as a number one draft pick and subsequent career has led to him being considered a draft bust. In 2011, he was included in Foxsports.com&#x27;s list of the ten worst No. 1 overall picks in NFL Draft history. In 2015, NESN ranked Carr as the 8th worst No. 1 overall pick in NFL Draft history. He is currently on NFL Network as an analyst.

==NFL career statistics==


==Coaching career==
In 2015, Carr became offensive coordinator at Bakersfield Christian High School, under head coach and younger brother Darren Carr.

==Personal life==
Carr married high school girlfriend Melody Tipton in March 1999. Together they have five children, three of whom have been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, which Carr also suffers from.

His brother Derek is also a quarterback in the NFL. Derek states that David was instrumental to the preparation and training that led up to the 2014 NFL draft and has helped greatly with training and experience since being drafted.

His uncle Lon Boyett played in the NFL as a tight end with the Buccaneers, Raiders and 49ers from 1977 to 1978.

<text>A Who&#x27;s Who (or Who Is Who) is a reference work consisting of biographical entries of notable people in a particular field. The oldest and best-known is the annual publication &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, a reference work on contemporary prominent people in Britain published annually since 1849.

==Notable examples by country==
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, the oldest listing of prominent British people since 1849; people who have died since 1897 are listed in &quot;Who Was Who&quot;
* &quot;Cambridge Who&#x27;s Who&quot; (also known as &quot;Worldwide Who&#x27;s Who&quot;), a vanity publisher based in Uniondale, New York
* &quot;Marquis Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, a series of books published since 1899 by Marquis, primarily listing prominent American people, but including &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the World&quot;
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in New Zealand&quot;, twelve editions published at irregular intervals between 1908 and 1991
* &quot;Canadian Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, a listing of prominent Canadians since 1910
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Switzerland&quot;, published from 1953 to 1996 and then &quot;Swiss Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, a listing of prominent Swiss or leading figures living in Switzerland since 2015
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Australia&quot;, a listing of prominent Australians since 1923

* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, by Metron Publications, a listing of prominent Greeks since 1992
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who of Southern Africa&quot;, published in paper form until 2007 when it was replaced by a website

== Non-English publications ==

Some &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; books have a title in the language of the country concerned:

* Croatian: &quot;Tko je tko u Hrvatskoj&quot;, bilingual edition (1993)
* Danish: &quot;Kraks Blå Bog&quot; (since 1910) annually
* Finnish: &quot;Kuka kukin on&quot; (since 1909) at first irregularly, every fourth year since 1970
* German:&quot; Wer ist&#x27;s?&quot; (1905–1935) and &quot; (since 1951) almost annually
* German: for East Germany: &quot;
* Japanese: &quot;Nihon Tarento Meikan&quot; (Talent Who&#x27;s Who in Japan), a listing of Japanese celebrities, or &quot;tarentos&quot;, since 1970
* Lithuanian: &quot;&quot; (Who&#x27;s Who in Lithuania), a listing of prominent Lithuanians and business companies since 1995.
* Norwegian:&quot; Hvem er Hvem?&quot; (since 1912) 14 editions in the 20th century
* Serbian:&quot; Koje ko u Serbiji&quot;, (1991), previously &quot;Koje ko u Jugoslaviji&quot;
* Swedish:&quot; Vem är det&quot; (since 1912) every second year

==Specialized publications==
* &quot;International Who&#x27;s Who&quot; by Europa Publications, a Taylor and Francis imprint
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Among American High School Students&quot; listing what it deems to be American high school and college students who particularly excel in the realm of academic achievement. The publishing company closed in 2007.
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in American Art&quot;, a listing of prominent American artists
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in British History&quot;
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the CIA&quot;, a book published in East Berlin in 1968 with the assistance of the KGB and the HVA purporting to reveal the identities of thousands of CIA officers.
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe&quot; a listing of DC Comics characters
* &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Theatre&quot;, published in Britain and the US from 1912 to 1982

==Other publications and scams==
The title &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; is in the public domain, and thousands of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; compilations of varying scope and quality (and similar publications without the words &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;) have been published by various authors and publishers. Some publications have been described as scams; they list any people likely to buy the book, or to pay for inclusion, with no criterion of genuine notability. They may offer vanity awards or expensive trophies.

One example is the defunct &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Among American High School Students&quot;, which was criticized for questionable nomination practices, as well as whether the listing&#x27;s entries are fact-checked and accurate. According to Steve Bjork, an admissions vice president of Hamline University: &quot;It&#x27;s honestly something that an admissions officer typically wouldn&#x27;t consider or wouldn&#x27;t play into an admissions decision.&quot; He suggested that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was &quot;just trying to sell books&quot;.

&quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; publications are not all of questionable value, but publishers that select truly notable people and provide trustworthy information on them are hard to identify. A &amp; C Black&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; is the canonical example of a legitimate &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; reference work, being the first to use the name and establish the approach in print, publishing annually since 1849. However, the longevity of a publication is not in itself a guarantee. In 1999, Tucker Carlson said in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine that Marquis Who&#x27;s Who, founded in 1898 but no longer an independent company, had adopted practices of address harvesting as a revenue stream, undermining its claim to legitimacy as a reference work listing people of merit. A 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; article observed that the entries in Marquis Who&#x27;s Who were &quot;not uniformly fact-checked&quot;.

<text>Mom Rajawongse Kukrit Pramoj (, , ; 20 April 1911 – 9 October 1995) was a Thai politician, author, scholar and professor. He was Speaker of the House of Representatives of Thailand between 1973 and 1974. He was the thirteenth Prime Minister of Thailand, serving in office from 1975 to 1976 between his brother Seni Pramoj&#x27;s terms. Being the great-grandson of King Rama II, he was a member of the Thai royal family.
He also portrayed the Prime Minister of the fictional country of Sarkhan in the 1963 motion picture &quot;The Ugly American&quot; with Marlon Brando.

==Biography==
He was born on 20 April 1911 in Sing Buri Province into a cadet branch of the Chakri Dynasty with Chinese ancestry. The son of Brigadier General Prince Khamrob and his wife Daeng (Bunnag), his older brother was M.R. Seni Pramoj while his great-grandmother, Ampha, was of Chinese descent and was a consort of Rama II. He served as a corporal during the Franco-Thai War in 1940. As was common for members of Thailand&#x27;s upper classes at the time, he was educated abroad; he attended school in England at Trent College, before reading philosophy, politics, and economics at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. 

Upon returning to Thailand, he began his career in banking, but his true vocation was his mastery of many forms of arts, including politics and journalism. Put off by Hollywood&#x27;s portrayal of King Mongkut in the 1946 film &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (based on the semi-fictional biographical novel of the same name) Kukrit and his brother, Seni Pramoj, wrote &quot;The King of Siam Speaks&quot; in 1948. They sent their manuscript to the American politician and diplomat Abbot Low Moffat who drew on it for his biography entitled &quot;Mongkut the King of Siam&quot; (), and in 1961, donated the Pramoj manuscript to the Southeast Asian Collection, Asian Division, Library of Congress. He wrote for &quot;Siam Rath&quot;, the newspaper that he founded.
As a means of showing how Thai society adjusted to life in modern society, in 1953 Kukrit began a series of stories on the life and times of fictional Mae Ploy (). who as a young girl enters the service of a princess of Rama V&#x27;s Royal Household, and dies the same day as Rama VIII. This story was to be one of many that were published in the Kukrit&#x27;s Siam Rath. His satirical sense and unique sense of humour offered an incisive view of the times Kukrit chronicled. As a scholar, he also wrote many non-fiction works ranging from history and religion to astrology. Most notable are his epics and many short stories portraying various aspects of life and documenting contemporary history. His &quot;Many Lives&quot; (, &quot;Lai Chiwit&quot;) was also translated into English. He was a leading authority on traditional Thai culture and had a polymathic range of interests from Thailand&#x27;s classical dance to literature. Most famous for his literary works, he was named a National Artist of Thailand for literature in 1985, the inaugural year for the honour. And he received The Special Commemorative Prize of The Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes in 1990, the inaugural year for the prizes again. His works encompass many subjects from humour to drama. He was also known as a staunch royalist and served the monarchy for his entire life. He is considered one of the great statesmen of Thailand. His former home is now a heritage museum which is preserved; paying homage to his life and Thai traditions.

He was married to M.R. Pakpring Thongyai with whom he had two children, a son and daughter. He died on 9 October 1995.

== Achievements ==

* He established the Social Action Party.
* M.R. Kukrit founded the Progress Party in 1946 and was elected to the first post-World War II Parliament.
* Appeared on screen with Marlon Brando in the movie &quot;The Ugly American&quot; (1963), in which he played Prime Minister Kwen Sai and spoke both Thai and English.
* As Prime Minister, established diplomatic ties with China in 1975, and supervised the withdrawal of American forces from Thailand after the Vietnam War.
* Named National Artist in Literature 1985.
* Received the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 1990.
* Founded the Khon Thammasat Troupe at Thammasat University, Khon being the highest form of dance drama in Thai classical dramatic arts.

=== Acting career ===
When George Englund decided to use Thailand as the location for the fictional country portrayed in his film &quot;The Ugly American&quot;, Kukrit was appointed as cultural advisor to make sure the film accurately portrayed monarchy in a Buddhist country. Englund had difficulty casting the part of the fictional Prime Minister, but he was so impressed by Kukrit&#x27;s cultural refinement and mastery of English that he offered him the part, saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of anyone who could play it better.&quot; Kukrit accepted, saying, according to Englund, &quot;We are all actors anyway, and I think you&#x27;re right that I could play it better than anyone.&quot; Probably because of this, after he became a real-life Prime Minister of Thailand in 1975, the word &quot;Sarkhan&quot; has entered the Thai language as a nickname of Thailand itself, often with a slight self-deprecating or mocking tone.

== M.R. Kukrit Heritage Home ==
The home that M.R. Kukrit built for himself in Bangkok has been registered by the Department of Fine Arts as &#x27;Home of an Important Person&#x27;. It is open to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and official Thai holidays. Standing in of land, surrounded by landscaped gardens, the house is a similar concept to the Jim Thompson House in Bangkok. Five small traditional Thai houses were dismantled and reassembled at the present site to make one house. The house is filled with artefacts and books collected by the owner. Additions to the original house include air conditioning, a modern bathroom, and a lift was installed when the owner became too frail to climb up and down stairs. The M.R. Kukrit Heritage Home is situated at 19 Soi Phra Pinit, South Sathorn Road, Sathon District, Bangkok 10120.

==Literary works==

===Literary career===
Kukrit Pramoj is perhaps best known in Thailand for his literary production, particularly his novel &quot;Four Reigns&quot;, which was published as a serial in his newspaper &quot;Siam Rat&quot; in 1950. &quot;Four Reigns&quot; tells the story of &quot;Mae Ploi,&quot; a young girl who grew up in the court of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) where she was an attendant to one of the princesses. Kukrit extends her story after her marriage during the reign of Rama VI, and in the process tells the story of mid-twentieth century Thailand through Mae Ploi&#x27;s eyes. The story includes the reigns of four Kings of the Chakri dynasty (thus the title &quot;Four Reigns&quot;), and the 1932 Revolution against the absolute monarchy. &quot;Four Reigns&quot; was translated into English by Tulachandra. The Thai version of &quot;Four Reigns&quot; continues to be well known to Thais in the twenty-first century because it has been used in Thai schools, and has been produced as a well-known films.

Only two other of Kukrit&#x27;s many novels, &quot;Many Lives&quot;, and &quot;Red Bamboo&quot; are translated into English. In addition, there is a compilation of a few of Kukrit&#x27;s English language writings and interviews, &quot;M. R. Kukrit Pramoj, His Wit and Wisdom&quot;, compiled by Vilas Manivat, and edited by Steve Van Beek. However, Kukrit&#x27;s writings in the Thai language are voluminous, and include both fiction and non-fiction. Much of Kukrit&#x27;s writing was first published as either columns or serials in the &quot;Siam Rat&quot;. A number of the books serialized and later turned into books including &quot;Four Reigns&quot;. A wide range of subjects were addressed in these books, including contemporary politics, Kukrit&#x27;s love of dogs, Thai history, Southeast Asian history, elephants, a history of the Jews, and many other subjects. A review of his book comparing feudalism in Thailand called sakdina and Britain was recently published in English. Kukrit&#x27;s essay is called &quot;Farang Sakdina.&quot; The article describes Kukrit&#x27;s views about good governance, monarchy, and democracy in Thailand and Britain.

The stage and screen versions were based on Margaret Landon&#x27;s 1944 book entitled Anna and the King of Siam. To correct the record, well-known Thai intellectuals Seni and Kukrit Pramoj wrote this account in 1948. The Pramoj brothers sent their manuscript to the American politician and diplomat Abbot Low Moffat (1901-1996), who drew on it for his biography entitled &quot;Mongkut the King of Siam&quot; (1961) . Moffat donated the Pramoj manuscript to the United States Library of Congress in 1961. (Southeast Asian Collection, Asian Division, Library of Congress)

<text>David Campbell (1870 – 25 August 1932) was a Manitoba politician. When the provincial Liberals merged with John Bracken&#x27;s Progressives in 1932, Campbell led a group of dissident, anti-merger Liberals into the subsequent election.

The group was known as the &quot;Continuing Liberals&quot;, and ran candidates in 13 seats. Some within the new &quot;Liberal-Progressive&quot; alliance claimed that this new Liberal party was receiving financial support from the province&#x27;s Conservatives, as a means of dividing the Liberal vote.

Shortly before election day, the party claimed they would hold the balance of power in the next parliament. This prediction proved incorrect; they failed to win any seats, and Campbell finished a poor fourth in St. Boniface (despite being the city&#x27;s mayor at the time). The &quot;Continuing Liberals&quot; ceased to exist after the election, and the &quot;Liberal-Progressives&quot; remained in government until 1958.

<text>Aristarkh Apollonovich Belopolsky (Аристарх Аполлонович Белопольский; – 16 May 1934) was a Russian and later Soviet astronomer. He was born in Moscow but his father&#x27;s ancestors are from a Serbian town called Belo Polje. Adjunct professor since 1900, extraordinary (1903) and ordinary (1906) academician of the Imperial Academy of Sciences.

== Life ==
Belopolsky got his degree at Moscow University in 1876, and in 1878, he became the assistant to Fyodor Aleksandrovich Bredikhin at Moscow Observatory. In 1888, he joined the staff of Pulkovo Observatory.

He worked in spectroscopy and discovered a number of spectroscopic binaries. Among others, he discovered that Castor B was a spectroscopic binary with a period of 2.92 days.

Belopolsky was known for his fine instrument making, and in 1900 he built a device for measuring the Doppler shift of spectra. He pioneered the use of optical Doppler shift to measure the rotational rates of distant objects. He was the first to discover that the equator of Jupiter rotates more rapidly than higher latitudes, and that the rings of Saturn do not rotate as a solid mass, proving that they were made up of individual small objects.

He attempted twice to measure the rotational rate of Venus, suggesting 24 hours in 1900 and 35 hours in 1911—one of countless unsuccessful attempts by astronomers of that time to measure the length of the Venusian day.

He was a good friend of Oskar Backlund, and when the latter died in 1916, he succeeded him as director of Pulkovo Observatory. However he resigned in 1918, because he did not like the administrative burden.

The crater Belopol&#x27;skiy on the Moon, the asteroid 1004 Belopolskya and an award of the Russian Academy of Sciences are named after him.

<text>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), &quot;An Institiúid Éireannach um Chosaint Raideolaíoch&quot;, was an independent public body in Ireland under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The RPII was established in 1992 under the Radiological Protection Act 1991, which conferred on the RPII a broad remit in relation to radiological protection in Ireland. The RPII was merged with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in August 2014, as part of the Irish Government&#x27;s Public Sector Reform Plan. RPII&#x27;s functions are now carried out by the Office of Radiation Protection and Environmental Monitoring within the EPA.

The general functions of the ORP are:
:*To provide advice to the Government, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and other Ministers on matters relating to radiological safety.
:*To provide information to the public on any matters relating to radiological safety which the ORP deems fit.
:*To maintain and develop a national laboratory for the measurement of levels of radioactivity in the environment, and to assess the significance of these levels for the Irish population.
:*To provide a personnel dosimetry and instrument calibration service for those who work with ionising radiation.
:*To control by licence the custody, use, manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, exportation and disposal of radioactive substances, irradiating apparatus and other sources of ionising radiation.
:*To assist in the development of national plans for emergencies arising from nuclear accidents and to act in support of such plans.
:*To provide a radioactivity measurement and certification service.
:*To prepare codes and regulations for the safe use of ionising radiation.
:*To carry out and promote research in relevant fields.
:*To monitor developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety generally, and to keep the Government informed of their implications for Ireland.
:*To co-operate with the relevant authorities in other states and with appropriate international organisations.
:*To represent the State on international bodies.
:*To be the competent authority under international conventions on nuclear matters.

The RPII was the successor to the Nuclear Energy Board which was formally wound up by the Radiological Protection Act 1991.

<text>Communist Marxist Party (CMP) was a political party in Kerala. The party was founded in 1986 when M. V. Raghavan was expelled from the CPI(M) due to a grave difference of opinion regarding the formation of alliances with the IUML. His support for forming a united front with parties such as the Indian Union Muslim League in order to take on alliances led by the INC was ultimately rejected by the CPI(M) leadership. He was subsequently expelled from the Party.

In 2011 assembly election of Kerala, CMP fielded 3 candidates but could not win any seat. CMP had links with the Party of Democratic Socialism of Saifuddin Chaudhury in West Bengal. M.V. Raghavan attended the PDS state conference in December 2003. CMP participated in the Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists.

==Split ==
In March 2014, the party split into two factions:
* CMP(A) led by K. R. Aravindakshan
* CMP(J) led by C. P. John

In 2019, some CMP(A) members joined CPI and some joined CPI(M). CMP(J) support the UDF.

==Mass organizations==
*All India Centre for Trade Unions (AICTU)

<text>The Nuclear Energy Board (officially titled ) was an Irish agency charged with developing nuclear power in Ireland. It was established in Ireland on 30 November 1973 by the &quot;Nuclear Energy (An Bord Fuinnimh Núicléigh) Act 1971&quot;.

The board was responsible in the 1970s for pursuing the policy of developing a nuclear power station, which was to be located at Carnsore Point, County Wexford. This policy ultimately failed and the board gradually faded from public attention, eventually concentrating on nuclear-related environmental reports. It was not a large organisation, with the Electricity Supply Board doing most operational work.

==Nuclear power==

=== Planning ===

In 1968, Ireland&#x27;s economic development required more energy production and the Electricity Supply Board began evaluating ways of diversifying its electricity generation. The Turlough Hill project had just commenced and this was one of the most prestigious engineering projects since the foundation of the state and the Shannon hydroelectric scheme. In the 1970s the need for new energy sources became more urgent, especially after the 1973 energy crisis. In 1975 Bord Gáis was established in order to develop Kinsale gas field, slowing the nuclear energy project as it was hoped it may be an alternative. However, in 1974 planning permission was sought for four reactors with County Wexford County Council, with one to be built immediately, most likely of pressurized water reactor design.

=== Uncertainty ===

The economic slowdown of 1974 and 1975 saw the project temporarily put on hold. When Desmond O&#x27;Malley became the new Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in 1977 the project once again became a priority of government policy. This time the government wanted to build a 650 MW plant at Carnsore at a cost of £350 million (Punt) at then-prices. In 1979 the project was again postponed, following a change in government when George Colley became the new minister in charge of the project and the incident at Three Mile Island in the United States. Friends of the Earth and other groups lobbied against the plan and in 1981 the Electricity Supply Board and the government announced it was no longer national policy.

=== Cancellation ===

Ultimately the board was remembered for the plans put on and off hold, and resulting immense controversy. Also there was criticism that the government overestimated the need of energy in Ireland in the future; at one point it was estimated that industry would consume 57% of energy by 1990 - internationally this is rather large, as 40% is a typical value. Nevertheless, Ireland in the 1970s was regarded as being in a dangerous position on energy, as 75% of needs were met by oil, and European Economic Community policy was to reduce this below 50% by 1985, after two energy crises.

==Aftermath==
After 1981 the Nuclear Energy Board was not immediately abolished, instead rather than becoming nuclear advocate, with the board became redefined in a new role as an environmentalist. The board sponsored a number of reports, in particular on the Sellafield plant which has long been a source of dispute between Ireland and the United Kingdom.

On 1 April 1992 the successor to the board was established, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The production of electricity for supply to the national grid, by nuclear fission, is currently prohibited under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Section 18).

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Wilfrith Elstob (8 September 1888 – 21 March 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Elstob was born in Chichester in 1888, the son of the Rev. Canon J. G. Elstob and Frances Alice Elstob. His elder brother, Eric, would serve in the Royal Navy and play first-class cricket. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital. Until war broke out and he volunteered, he was a schoolteacher. When Elstob was 29 years old, and a temporary lieutenant colonel commanding the 16th (Service) Battalion, Manchester Regiment, British Army during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions on 21 March 1918 at the Manchester Redoubt, near Saint-Quentin, France on the first day of the German spring offensive. He was killed in action that same day.

===Citation===
==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of the Manchester Regiment, at Ashton Town Hall, Ashton-under-Lyne, England.

==Commemoration==
Elstob has no known grave. He is commemorated on the Pozières Memorial, in the Somme department of France, to the missing of the Fifth Army; and on the war memorials in Macclesfield &amp; Congleton, Cheshire. There is a memorial to him in All Saints Church, Siddington, where his father was vicar.

<text>The 2004 Tour de France was the 91st edition of Tour de France, one of cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours. The Tour began in Liège, Belgium with a prologue individual time trial on 3 July and Stage 10 occurred on 14 July with a hilly stage from Limoges. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 25 July.

==Stage 10==
14 July 2004 — Limoges to Saint-Flour, 

This 237 km stage was the longest of the 2004 Tour and the first to feature some serious climbs. Cutting through the departments of Haute-Vienne, Corrèze, and Cantal, and so part of the Massif Central, the big climbs were the cat-1 Col du Pas de Peyrol (Le Puy Mary) and the cat-2&#x27;s the Col de Néronne and the Col de Prat-de-Bouc. On Bastille Day the predominantly French crowd was willing a French stage win, a feat achieved thirteen times since 1947, the last being Laurent Jalabert in 2001. The day was calm, warm and sunny. 172 riders started the stage.

The race began with small attacks in the first few kilometres but the peloton kept control until around Linards, at 35 km. A group of four riders, including veteran climber Richard Virenque, managed to pull out a small lead, they were joined by seven other riders just before the first sprint, but their lead was just 20 seconds. After the small lead group swelled to eighteen riders US Postal came to the front of the peloton and all the escapees except Virenque and Axel Merckx (son of Eddy) were soon back in the main group. The determined duo slowly pulled away, extending their advantage to 60 seconds by the 50 km mark. Joly and Kroon tried to join them but fell short and after they returned to the peloton the pace of the main group fell slightly, USP reduced their efforts, and the two leaders pulled further ahead. After the second climb (Col de Lestards, 67 km raced, cat-3) they were almost four minutes ahead.

Virenque and Merckx pulled further ahead over the third climb and by the second intermediate sprint were 8&#x27;05&quot; clear. At the summit of the Cote de Chalvignac (126.5 km raced) they had over nine minutes in hand. Brioches la Boulangere were doing most of the work at the front of the peloton. On the Col de Néronne the lead was 10&#x27;40&quot;, Virenque had taken maximum points on every climb.

On the ascent of the cat-1 Col du Pas de Peyrol, after 135 km together, Merckx was dropped by Virenque. His lead over the peloton was down to 9&#x27;00&quot; and he had about half-a-minute over Merckx. On the descent there were two nasty crashes out of the peloton by Matthias Kessler and Sebastian Hinault.

Over the eighth summit (Col d&#x27;Entremont) Virenque had a minute over Merckx and had maintained his advantage over the peloton. On the final major summit, the Col de Prat de Bouc, with 31.5 km to the finish, Virenque led Merckx by over four minutes and had 7&#x27;45&quot; over the rest. Merckx was caught by the peloton on the descent and then dropped by the peloton (he finished a minute down on the peloton).

Virenque held his lead, the peloton did not make a major effort to catch him, and he came in over five minutes ahead. He had been out in front for 202 km and raced the final 62 km alone. It was his seventh career Tour stage victory, his maximum points haul was enough to put him in the polka-dot jersey for the first time in 2004 and his win also jumped him 51 places in the &quot;classement général&quot;.

==Stage 11==
15 July 2004 — Saint-Flour to Figeac, 

This 164 km stage remained in hilly territory but featured no climbs as severe as Stage 10. There were just five categorised climbs, the largest being the cat-2 Côte de Montsalvy at 99.5 km. The day was warm, road-side temperatures reached as high as 45 °C and there was little wind.

After the usual early escape attempts the peloton split on the very first climb at 6.5 km, although they were soon back together. Very quickly after the regrouping Jens Voigt and Juan Antonio Flecha broke away, they were joined by four others, but never got further than 20 seconds ahead and soon rejoined the US Postal led peloton. Minutes after that group had been swept up seven more riders tried to get away, they were soon caught and again another four riders made an attack. This group grew to seven before being caught on the second climb, the Cote de Therondels.

On the short descent, after 56 km raced, David Moncoutié and Egoi Martínez made a break, they were soon joined by Flecha and the trio managed to push their lead above 30 seconds and then further. In the 15 km to the third climb they established a 1&#x27;50&quot; gap. Their advantage reached 7&#x27;50&quot; at 90 km raced, fell back over the fourth climb, the Cote de Montsalvy, before rising again to over eight minutes.

The leaders took an eight-minute advantage into the final 10 km and the attacks began from within the trio. Flecha had an attempt and was caught, but then Moncoutie broke away and the remaining pair didn&#x27;t chase. His lead grew by 60 seconds in the next 4 km and he cruised over the line for his first Tour victory 2&#x27;15&quot; ahead of his two chasers, who both looked decidedly jaded. Moncoutié is a native of the region and the first &quot;régionaux&quot; winner since 1974. The peloton came in six minutes after Moncoutié and there were no changes to the top ten.

==Stage 12==
16 July 2004 — Castelsarrasin to La Mongie, 

This 197.5 km stage was the first to enter the Pyrenees. The route had no categorised climbs until the 160 km mark. The two climbs were both cat-1, the Col d&#x27;Aspin was included in a stage for the 66th time and the finish was at La Mongie (third inclusion), a ski resort at the top of another cat-1 climb. There were expectations that Armstrong would make a move on this stage, as he had won a previous stage to La Mongie in 2002. It was another sunny, cloudless day at the start but as the riders approached the mountains there was heavy rain.

A break by four riders in the first two minutes was allowed to get away. Counter-attacks were swallowed up by the US Postal and Brioches la Boulangere led peloton, but the foursome built their lead over the long approach to the Col d&#x27;Aspin to a maximum of just over four minutes. With about 100 km raced the peloton started to cut into the leaders&#x27; advantage and caught them three km from the start of the ascent of the Col d&#x27;Aspin.

US Postal led the peloton up the mountain, setting a pace that dropped many non-climbers. There were several attacks on the ascent and the riders were led over the summit by Mickael Rasmussen, who had a 5&quot; lead over Christophe Moreau, Virenque was third. Despite the wet road the descent was rapid and broke up the peloton.

The rain stopped as the riders approached the final climb. Rasmussen took a 30&quot; lead into the ascent but he was soon caught by a group of eleven, including Armstrong and Mayo. Having dropped Ullrich, Armstrong was quick to attack himself and the group pulled away from Ullrich. Sastre was still ahead of the group and with 3 km to the finish he was chased by Armstrong, who was accompanied by Ivan Basso. Armstrong caught and dropped Sastre and led Basso under the 1 km mark. In the final metres Basso put on a spurt, Armstrong did not respond, and Basso won the stage. Mayo came in 1&#x27;09&quot; down, Ullrich 2&#x27;30&quot;, and Tyler Hamilton 3&#x27;27&quot;. Other riders staggered in over the next 100 minutes. Thomas Voeckler finished 3&#x27;59&quot; behind but stayed in yellow (he has now spent longer in yellow than any Frenchman since 1992), Armstrong rose to second in the &quot;classement général&quot;.

==Stage 13==
17 July 2004 — Lannemezan to Plateau de Beille, 

This was the second day in the Pyrenees. The 205.5 km stage had five major climbs, including the 15.9 km &quot;hors categorie&quot; climb to the finish at Plateau-de-Beille, the first such climb on the 2004 Tour. The other main climbs were the Col de Portet d&#x27;Aspet, the Col de la Core, the Col de Latrape, and the Col d&#x27;Agnes. The Col d&#x27;Agnes actually has a steeper gradient than the final climb (average 8.2% to average 7.8%) but is shorter at 9.8 km. Many mountains on this stage have been included before, notably the Col du Portet d&#x27;Aspet, this is its 51st inclusion since 1910 including the tragic occasion in 1995 when Fabio Casartelli crashed on the descent and later died. On another bright and hot day 165 riders started the stage.

The usual early break, this time by fifteen riders, was quickly chased down by the US Postal team. Haimar Zubeldia was dropped early and abandoned the Tour, a short while later Denis Menchov abandoned and before the first climb Gerrit Glomser dropped out. Another smaller group quickly sprang away after the capture of the first break, and held a slim advantage for a few more kilometres before being swept up. Again there was another break, this time by Sylvain Chavanel and Jens Voigt. The pair broke away, and as the peloton slowed, built up a reasonable lead – heading the peloton by 3&#x27;06&quot; over the first climb, with Michael Rasmussen caught in no-man&#x27;s-land 70&quot; behind the leaders.

On the second climb, the Col du Portet d&#x27;Aspet, Rasmussen caught and stayed with the two leaders and the three went over the summit with a lead of 3&#x27;50&quot; over the peloton. A substantial group (a &quot;grupetto&quot;) were dropped on the ascent by the main peloton. As the riders passed through the feedzone Tyler Hamilton abandoned.

The trio extended their lead on the flatter part and had a 5&#x27;00&quot; advantage over the Col de Core. On the fourth climb they pulled out a little further and the chasing peloton dropped many riders including Iban Mayo and Thomas Voeckler. On the Col d&#x27;Agnes Voigt and Rasmussen dropped Chavanel and in the twenty-strong chasing group the five US Postal riders started to push harder. At the summit the leading pair&#x27;s advantage over the peloton had fallen to 3&#x27;40&quot;, Voeckler was a further minute back, with Mayo a surprising 14&#x27;05&quot; adrift.

Over the Port de Lers Voigt stopped working and simply followed Rasmussen over the summit, 3&#x27;50&quot; ahead. Behind them the chasers joined up, forming a thirty-strong group including Voeckler, who had fought his way back. At the start of the final climb Voigt and Rasmussen held an insufficient 3&#x27;10&quot; lead.

On the final climb US Postal led the chasers. The group quickly started losing riders, again including Voeckler. By the time the gap had been cut to 1&#x27;30&quot; the chasing group had shrunk to just eleven, notables were Armstrong, Ullrich, Leipheimer, Mancebo and stage 12&#x27;s winner Basso. By the time Voight was caught, Armstrong&#x27;s group was just four – himself, teammate José Azevedo, Georg Totschnig and Ivan Basso. Rasmussen was quickly caught too, but Armstrong powered on and shed Totschnig and both the previous leaders. Azevedo led the other two into the last 8 km before falling away, by 5 km to go the two leaders were 45&quot; ahead of Totschnig (Azevedo was 1&#x27;40&quot; behind). Basso led out the last kilometre but in the final 100 m Armstrong passed him for his first stage win of the 2004 Tour and his 19th career Tour victory. Ullrich came in 2&#x27;42&quot; later, Voeckler was 13th at 4&#x27;42&quot; and kept the yellow jersey by 22&quot;.

==Stage 14==
18 July 2004 — Carcassonne to Nîmes, 

After the Pyrenees comes a 192.5 km stage without a single categorised climb. The flat stages after mountains often have long breakaway winners as the main competitors recuperate. On a hot and hazy day with a slight breeze 160 riders started the stage.

The race started with a flurry of attacks, all were quickly closed down – including a twenty-man break. US Postal and Voeckler&#x27;s &#x27;Bakery Boys&#x27; led the peloton. After 30 km raced a four strong attack built up a little lead, the group pushed their lead out to 60 seconds over the first sprint but were pulled back to barely 15&quot; soon afterwards. With the leaders so close there were plenty of riders trying to cross the gap and they were caught at the 65 km mark by a Rabobank lead peloton.

There were a number of other attacks, including a twelve-man attempt, but Lotto and Quickstep closed them down, the overall pace was high – over 45 km/h average in the second hour. However, around 15:00, with 100 km raced, ten men made it away, coalescing from a number of smaller breaks – they were a sufficient mix of teams (nine!) and low places (the best placed was 43rd) that there was no team wanting to chase. The ten quickly pulled away, gaining a 2&#x27;50&quot; advantage in the next 15 minutes of racing. After an hour in the lead and with 50 km to go their advantage was 10&#x27;50&quot;. The peloton was &#x27;policed&#x27; by Brioches la Boulangere and the ten men kept working together into the final 15 kilometres, leading by 13&#x27;19&quot;.

As the finish approached, cooperation among the ten fell apart and a series of attacks and chases split and rejoined the group. With around 5 km to go Aitor Gonazalez attacked for a second time and tore away into a 15&quot; lead as the others hesitated, only Nicolas Jalabert and Christophe Mengin chased and they couldn&#x27;t catch him. Gonzalez won, Jalabert grabbed second and the others drifted in. The peloton came in 14&#x27;12&quot; back, with sprinters points going down to 25th place there was a strongly contested sprint, with McEwen just beating Hushovd for 11th place and one extra point over his green jersey rival. The top ten in the &quot;classement général&quot; was completely unchanged. Monday, July 19, is a rest day before a return to mountains – the Alps.

==Stage 15==
20 July 2004 — Valréas to Villard-de-Lans, 

This 180.5 km stage was the first in the Alps, and it was all up or down. There were seven categorised climbs, including four in the final 50 km with the additional cat-2 rise to the finish. The biggest climbs were the 10.7 km of the cat-2 Col des Limouches, the 12 km climb of the cat-1 Col de l&#x27;Echarasson and the 10.3 km up the cat-2 Col de Chalimont. The day was hot and sunny as 158 riders started the stage (Mayo and Piil abandoned, Piil was injured while Mayo was simply disgusted with his form).

As on other mountain stages with a flat(ish) start an early break was allowed to get away. Nine riders led over the first two climbs, chasing them down split the peloton – leaving a sixty-strong group lagging a minute behind. After the breakaway was caught another sprang away – a group of, eventually, 15 riders led by over 3&#x27;30&quot; on the third climb. The group included Stuart O&#x27;Grady who raced away to win the points of the second intermediate sprint.

On the long climb up the Col de l&#x27;Echarasson, while the leaders were slowly caught, Ullrich attempted his own break, leading Armstrong by 40&quot; as he went over the summit. He pulled further away over the Col de Carri but as Jens Voigt dropped back from his break-away group to assist Ivan Basso in defending his 2nd overall spot against Ullrich&#x27;s attack, Armstrong&#x27;s group quickly caught Ullrich before the sixth climb. Rasmussen and Virenque were only 50&quot; ahead.

Armstrong&#x27;s group caught everyone, and chased down a break by Leipheimer, on the ascent of the Col de Chalimont. Thomas Voeckler was over seven minutes back. On the final climb to the finish the leading group was still nine strong, with 1 km to go it was down to Armstrong, Basso, Klöden, and Ullrich. In the final sprint Armstrong beat Basso, claiming his 20th stage victory and the yellow jersey. Voeckler came in 9&#x27;27&quot; down.

==Stage 16==
21 July 2004 — Le Bourg-d&#x27;Oisans to Alpe d&#x27;Huez, (ITT)

This 15.5 km stage was an individual time trial, including the 13.9 km up the twenty-one hairpin bends of the famous &quot;hors categorie&quot; L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez. The mountain had been included in the Tour on over 20 occasions, first in 1952. The stage was dedicated to Italian cyclist Marco Pantani, who had died earlier in 2004. Pantani had set the ascent time record of 36&#x27; 50&quot; in the 1995 Tour de France, measured from 13.8 km below the summit. Starting in reverse order of standings, 157 riders raced the stage. It was sunny and warm, with light cloud cover.

Lance Armstrong won, passing Ivan Basso on the road. The huge number of spectators, some estimated over 750,000, seemed to impede the later riders, particularly as the first part of the course was wholly open, and many riders found themselves spat on by their detractors as they struggled to beat their way through the crowd. It would later be revealed that Armstrong had received death threats the day before this stage – something that would have been all too easy to carry out given the open course. Although much looked forward to, the stage was regarded by many as something of a disappointment due to the unmanageability of the crowds.

==Stage 17==
22 July 2004 — Le Bourg-d&#x27;Oisans to Le Grand-Bornand, 

On this, the last big mountain stage, the drama started early on the Col de la Madeleine, the highest climb in the Tour, as a group led by Giberto Simoni was caught just before the summit by Richard Virenque, who gave Simoni a tight chase for the mountain points and for the five thousand Euro prize earmarked for the winner of that climb. Simoni managed to edge it out, though, taking the sprint.

As the stage wore on, US Postal led the peloton with typical skill, until the final climb, where the lead break consisted of Armstrong, Ullrich, Basso, Klöden, and Armstrong&#x27;s support rider Floyd Landis. At the top of the final climb, Armstrong told Landis to go for the win, and Landis took off, but was successfully ridden down by Ullrich, Basso, and Klöden. Klöden took off for the win pulling out what seemed to be a decisive gap in the last kilometre, but Armstrong, determined to compensate for his teammate Landis&#x27;s loss of the stage, put in a devastating final sprint and got past him at the line for another stage win, and yet more of an advantage over his rivals in the GC.

==Stage 18==
23 July 2004 — Annemasse to Lons-le-Saunier, 

This stage was 166.5 km and the last in the mountains, it featured only one substantial climb, the cat-2 Col de la Faucille. With the time trial of Stage 19 looming this was a perfect chance for some lower placed riders to get away. The weather was hot and humid with a little rain at the start. Just 147 riders started the stage.

Some early drama was provided when Italian rider Filippo Simeoni, who has claimed that a doctor with ties to Armstrong had told him how to take performance-enhancing drugs without being caught, tried to join an early (and, as it would turn out, successful) break. Armstrong himself chased him down – unusual for a team leader and yellow jersey, especially since Simeoni was no threat to Armstrong in the overall standings. Armstrong, taking upon himself the self-styled role of &#x27;boss&#x27; or &#x27;le patron&#x27; of the peloton in the tradition of others in the past such as Bernard Hinault, forced his will and stayed with the break until they got two minutes ahead, at which point the rest of the break asked Simeoni to leave, which he did, followed by Armstrong. Simeoni harshly criticized Armstrong in the press following the stage, while Armstrong maintained that he was protecting the interests of the peloton, and accused Simeoni of trying to destroy professional cycling.

Left alone, and with US Postal controlling the peloton, the rest of the break rapidly pulled away. They held a lead of up to 7 minutes until the third climb, after which they moved even further ahead. Their advantage peaked at around 12&#x27;00&quot;. Into the final 20 km the group of six began to split as the attacks came. With 10 km to the finish Mercado and Garcia-Acosta attacked and made it away, they worked together into the final kilometre, Mercado just winning the sprint – his first ever stage win. The peloton came in 11&#x27;29&quot; down led by Thor Hushovd.

==Stage 19==
24 July 2004 — Besançon, (ITT)

The final time trial held less suspense this year than it sometimes does, since Armstrong already had such a commanding lead, but Armstrong came in saying he was racing to win. The biggest questions coming in, however, were whether Jan Ullrich would be able to race fast enough to get himself a podium spot, and whether Thomas Voeckler, who managed to hold the yellow jersey for ten days, despite numerous predictions he&#x27;d lose it well before that, would hold onto the lead in the young riders classification, which he held with a 45-second lead.

Starting with the last place rider, Jimmy Casper, and ending with Armstrong, the riders ran the loop in and out of Besançon. For most of the race, US Postal riders held the fastest time, with Viatceslav Ekimov setting an early fast time, eventually beaten by Bobby Julich. Julich was eventually beaten by Floyd Landis, who held the fastest time until the last few riders came in, with Kloden, Ullrich, and Armstrong all beating him. Armstrong had the fastest time, coming in a full minute over his nearest rider, Ullrich. Ullrich ran an impressive time trial, but wasn&#x27;t able to pull ahead of Basso, and will almost certainly finish the Tour in 4th place.

Voeckler, meanwhile, finally had his luck run out, finishing six minutes behind his nearest rival for the white jersey, Vladimir Karpets, who came in 8th in the time trial.

==Stage 20==
25 July 2004 — Montereau-Fault-Yonne to Paris, 

The largely ceremonial run into Paris held some drama this year due to the closeness of the green jersey competition, which Robbie McEwen led going in by a slim 11 points. With two intermediate sprints and the finish line in Paris, there were plenty of opportunities for Thor Hushovd to take the lead. The two intermediate sprints had no effect on the overall standings, with Hushovd taking one and McEwen taking the other. The final sprint sealed it for McEwen, however, as he finished fourth and Hushovd failed to finish in the top 10.

Early dramatics, however, were provided when Fillipo Simeoni made another attack at 1 km. He was pulled in by 8 km by the US Postal led peloton, and Armstrong did not make any personal effort to chase him down this time. He made three subsequent attacks throughout the stage, all unsuccessful.

Shortly after Simeoni&#x27;s first attack, Jimmy Casper, the &quot;lanterne rouge&quot;, or last place rider, made an attack, shooting out ahead of Armstrong. Having gotten his lead, he removed a digital camera from the pocket of his jersey and snapped a picture of him leading Armstrong, then dropped back to the peloton. 2004 is the second year that Casper has finished the Tour de France, and the second year he won the &quot;lanterne rouge&quot;.

As the peloton reached Paris, a ten-man break including Axel Merckx and Thomas Voeckler got away, but was pulled back several laps further down the Champs-Élysées. Eventually, the stage was won with a solid sprint by Tom Boonen. Armstrong sat well back, losing ten seconds to his nearest rival, but staying in the yellow jersey by well over six minutes. This appeared at the time to represent an unprecedented sixth Tour de France win for Armstrong, but he was stripped of the 2004 title with all others following a 2012 doping investigation.

<doc id="857400" wikidata="Q1518568" url="?curid=857400" title="Green Party (Norway)">
<text>The Green Party (, , , MDG; ) is a centre-left green political party in Norway. The party holds three seats in the Parliament of Norway (gaining 3.9% in the 2021 elections) and also has representation in municipal councils and county councils (gaining 4.1% in the 2023 elections).

Similar to its German role model Alliance 90/The Greens, MDG represents green politics with social liberal features. It has been described as centre-left by academics and voters. The party has historical roots partly in the new left of the 1960s and 1970s, and partly in the broader environmental movement of the 1970s and 1980s, which itself was highly diverse and attracted support from both the new left and environmentally-oriented liberals and conservatives who rallied around environmental issues. Over time the party has moved in a more centrist and socially liberal direction. MDG stands in a progressive tradition and also defines itself as an intersectional feminist party. The party claims distance from the two dominant right-wing and left-wing political blocks, jointly denominated as &quot;the fossil block&quot;. The party has gradually moved closer to liberal internationalism over time, allowing for the use of military force when it can promote peace and human rights. MDG supports Norwegian EU membership and NATO membership, while also advocating for a focus on arms control and peaceful conflict resolution. The party&#x27;s voters are among the most pro-EU, and MDG has been described as a party for &quot;urban, liberal, moderately left-wing academics.&quot;

The Green Party is a member of the European Green Party and the Global Greens, and was founded with the German Greens as its stated model. It maintains close ties to other Green parties including the German Greens and the Swedish Greens. It is led by Arild Hermstad.

==History==
The process of forming a new national green party in Norway was initiated in December 1984, with the official launch in 1988. Among the pioneers were the late philosopher Arne Næss, peace researcher Johan Galtung, and the philosopher Sigmund Kvaløy Setreng.

In the local elections between 1991 and 2009, the Green Party had six to eight representatives elected each time. In the national elections the party never exceeded 0.5% support.

Since 2005, the Greens have seen a significant membership rise, with the new members coming from a wide variety of other parties, including the seven established parliamentary parties.

In the municipal elections of 2011, the party saw its first local breakthrough, having garnered close to 22,000 votes on a national basis. Two years later, during the campaign for the 2013 general election, the party saw a significant rise in support in the opinion polls. The Greens were widely expected to gain parliamentary representation to some extent. In the election, the Greens gathered over 79,000 votes, making them the eighth biggest party in the country. This vote count translates to 2.8 percent of the vote. Rasmus Hansson, the party&#x27;s top candidate from Oslo was elected to parliament, becoming the first ever Green MP.

In the local elections of 2015 the Green Party overtook the 4% nationally for the first time in its history and got the third place in Oslo.

The party have stated their refusal to form a government with any parties that will continue to drill for oil in the North Sea.

==Ideology==
The Green Party is one of the global ecologist and environmentalist political parties and movements. As a member of the pan-European European Green Party, the Norwegian Greens subscribe to social progressivism and social justice. The main focus of the party is environmental protection and ecological sustainability. The party seeks to introduce a tax on wasteful consumption, and to reorganise the food industry. The Greens have also pledged support for a reform in the agrarian industry, increasing the production of organic crops and strengthening the eco-friendly agricultural sector.

The Green party seeks to reduce the Norwegian petroleum extraction in order to counteract serious climate change. The proposal is to stop extraction by 2040.

<text>George Magoffin Humphrey (March 8, 1890January 20, 1970) was an American lawyer, businessman and banker. He served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury for President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

== Early life ==
Humphrey was born on March 8, 1890, and raised in Cheboygan, Michigan, the son of Caroline (née Magoffin) Humphrey (1861–1946) and Watts Sherman Humphrey (1844–1916).

Through his brother Watts S. Humphrey, he was the uncle of software engineer Watts Humphrey.

He received both his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Michigan.

==Career==
After practicing law in Saginaw, Michigan for five years with his father&#x27;s firm, he accepted a position as general counsel with steel manufacturer M. A. Hanna Company in 1917. That association lasted 35 years and included his ascension to company president in 1929. He served as Chairman of The Business Council, then known as the Business Advisory Council for the United States Department of Commerce in 1946. Following Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s election to the Presidency in 1952, Humphrey was recommended by close adviser General Lucius D. Clay, who had worked with the corporate magnate regarding post-war plans in Germany.

== Secretary of the Treasury ==
As Secretary of the Treasury in the first Republican Administration in 20 years, Humphrey was one of the most influential of President Eisenhower&#x27;s Cabinet members. Eisenhower was once quoted as saying, &quot;When George speaks, we all listen.&quot;

Humphrey had given up a $300,000 salary to accept the Cabinet position that paid just $22,500. He fought to have a balanced budget, tight money, limits on welfare and foreign aid, as well as &quot;trickle down&quot; tax cuts. He was even more adamant about government spending, saying in a 1957 press conference that if it wasn&#x27;t curbed, &quot;you will have a depression that will curl your hair.&quot; Humphrey left office on July 29, 1957. Following Humphrey&#x27;s departure that same year, he returned to the Hanna Company, serving as honorary board chairman and director, then later became chairman of National Steel Corporation.

=== Later life===
In 1962, Humphrey became embroiled in a potential controversy when a Senate committee investigated the stockpiling of nickel during his time in the Cabinet. The $98 million deal involved companies he had once headed, but he explained that his motivation was to increase the country&#x27;s strategic stockpiles and was thus cleared. He made no profit from the deal.

==Personal life==
On January 15, 1913, Humphrey was married to Pamela Stark of Saginaw. They had three children together:

* Cynthia Pamela Humphrey, who married Royal Firman Jr. They divorced in September 1970.
* Gilbert Watts Humphrey (d. 1979), who became the Chairman of the Hanna conglomerate.
* Caroline Helen Humphrey, who married John G. Butler.

In his later years, Humphrey essentially remained out of the spotlight. His health deteriorated when he suffered an apparent heat stroke in August 1969. He then became a frequent visitor to hospitals until entering Cleveland&#x27;s University Hospital cardiac unit on December 27, 1969. He died there on January 20, 1970. He was buried at the Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.

<text>John Wesley Snyder (June 21, 1895 – October 8, 1985) was an American businessman and senior federal government official. Thanks to his close personal friendship with President Harry S. Truman, Snyder was appointed Secretary of the Treasury during the Truman administration. He was the first native-born Arkansan to hold a U.S. Cabinet post. 

Historian Alonzo Hamby emphasizes Snyder&#x27;s conservatism, noting that he was openly skeptical of New Deal policies, broad social programs, and intellectuals who believed the economy could be centrally managed from Washington.

==Early life==
Snyder was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas, on June 21, 1895, to Jeremiah &quot;Jerre&quot; Hartwell Snyder and his wife, Ellen (Hatcher). He was the third of six children. His father owned a small patent medicine manufacturing and distribution business in Jonesboro. Snyder received his early education through high school in Jonesboro and later attended Vanderbilt University’s School of Engineering from 1914 to 1915. Due to financial difficulties, he left the university and returned to Arkansas, moving to Forrest City, Arkansas, where he boarded with his sister, Sula Snyder Warren, and taught at a small country school.

In 1915, Snyder volunteered for the army and trained at Fort Logan H. Roots in North Little Rock, Arkansas, in the artillery. He served with distinction as an officer in the Thirty-Second Artillery. During World War I, he saw action in five different sectors of the Western Front and was decorated for his service by both the United States and France. During his time in the artillery, he became friends with several notable Americans, including boxer Gene Tunney, America’s “ace of aces” fighter pilot Eddie Rickenbacker, and future presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman (both of whom also served in the artillery). Snyder was mustered out of the army in 1919 and returned to Arkansas after the war. He retained his commission as a captain and eventually achieved the rank of colonel in the Army Reserve.

On January 5, 1920, he married Carrie Evlyn Cook (1895–1956). They had one daughter, Edith Cook &quot;Drucie&quot; Snyder Horton (1925–1999), born in Forrest City, Arkansas. Although Snyder initially planned to return to school to become an electrical engineer, he took his first job in the banking industry as a bookkeeper at a bank in Forrest City, at the urging of his uncle. Over the next ten years, he advanced rapidly in his profession, working as an officer at numerous banks in Arkansas and Missouri.

==Washington==
Snyder moved to Washington in the early 1930s with extensive experience in banking and business. He held several public and private offices, including National Bank Receiver in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Loan Administrator, and Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion. In the latter role, he played a key part in transitioning the American economy from a wartime to a peacetime footing. However, liberals criticized him for removing federal controls on the economy too quickly after the war, arguing that this hurt consumers, delayed the housing program, and bankrupted small businesses. His biographer noted that, &quot;His handling of the steel crisis in 1946 was an even greater fiasco.&quot;

==Treasury Secretary==
Snyder was appointed Secretary of the Treasury in 1946 by his close personal friend, President Harry S. Truman, with whom he had served in the Army Reserves. Editorials criticized the appointment for cronyism and argued that Snyder&#x27;s narrow range of experience made him unfit for the role. His main task as Secretary was to establish a stable postwar economy. The key elements of his program included maintaining confidence in the government&#x27;s credit, reducing the federal debt, keeping interest rates low, and encouraging public thrift through investment in U.S. Savings Bonds. A deeply conservative businessman, Snyder believed that the free market would ultimately stabilize itself. He successfully reduced the national debt while balancing the budget, but he was reluctant to support large expenditures for the Marshall Plan, which provided aid to Europe.

Snyder&#x27;s lack of diplomatic experience showed during his negotiations with British officials over the UK&#x27;s need for U.S. dollars. He upset his British counterparts, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Gaitskell. Paul Nitze, an American negotiator, recalled a 1949 meeting in Washington where Snyder made undiplomatic remarks, essentially telling the British to &quot;get off their butt&quot; and solve their productivity problems. Gaitskell described Snyder as &quot;a pretty small minded, small town semi-isolationist.&quot; Fortunately for the British, Snyder was outmaneuvered by Secretary of State Dean Acheson, who was more sympathetic to their situation.

Snyder funded the Korean War by raising taxes, and his tenure was marked by constant feuding with the Federal Reserve System, which gained greater independence in 1951. He retired from government service in 1953 at the end of Truman&#x27;s second term.

Snyder died in Seabrook Island, South Carolina, on October 8, 1985, at the age of 90, and was buried in Washington National Cathedral.

<doc id="857450" wikidata="Q1439143" url="?curid=857450" title="George Humphrey (psychologist)">
<text>George William Humphrey FRSC (17 July 1889 – 24 April 1966) was a British psychologist, author, and philosopher. He was the founder of the Canadian Psychological Association, the first Director of the Institute of Experimental Psychology, and Professor of Psychology at the University of Oxford. Humphrey&#x27;s research concentrated on behavioral studies such as reinforcement, habituation, and apparent movements, as well as psychophysical topics like audiogenic seizures. He is known for Humphrey&#x27;s Law.

== Personal life ==
George Humphrey was born in the county of Kent, England on 17 July 1889. He was a student of Wilhelm Wundt, who inspired Humphrey&#x27;s early passion for experimental psychology. Psychologist Raymond Dodge also impacted Humphrey&#x27;s work in experimental psychology, as they amicably worked together at Wesleyan University. Being well known for his academic achievement and also highly regarded by his peers, Humphrey was selected by St. John&#x27;s College at Cambridge to be the first Dominion Fellow of the college&#x27;s new &quot;Dominion Fellowship,&quot; established in 1947, to recognize individuals with a profound commitment to study and scholarship. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Humphrey married Muriel Miller in 1918, but after her death in 1955, he remarried the following year to his colleague Berta Hotchberger. He spent the last years of his life in St. John&#x27;s College at Cambridge, where he was actively involved in the school and surrounded by close friends. Humphrey died after an illness quickly took his life on 24 April 1966. In his honor, Queen&#x27;s University designated the main building of their department of psychology as Humphrey Hall. His colleagues remembered him as being very friendly, active, and neat, but also tenacious of his opinions.

== Education ==
Humphrey graduated with honors from the University of Oxford where he studied the classical languages, mathematics, and philosophy. He was given a scholarship to study psychology at the University of Leipzig and worked alongside Wilhelm Wundt in the first psychology laboratory. Humphrey received a PhD in psychology from Harvard University in 1920.

== Professional History ==
In 1916, Humphrey traveled to Canada to teach classics at St. Francis Xavier University until 1918. After receiving his doctorate in 1920, he took a job as an assistant professor for four years at Wesleyan University in the United States. Humphrey returned to Canada and was given the position of Charlton Professor in Philosophy at Queen&#x27;s University from 1924 to 1947. When he arrived at the university, psychology was a relatively new field of study and was included in the Department of Philosophy. He made great strides to further develop this aspect of the department. In 1939, he founded the Canadian Psychological Association and appointed Donald Hebb to be the first instructor in experimental psychology at Queen&#x27;s. Like other experimental psychologists at the time, he set up his own laboratory to bring the study of experimental psychology to the university. He was named head of the department and added new psychology courses, including graduate courses. Because of Humphrey&#x27;s contributions, the university began to recognize psychology as being independent from the philosophy department, but wasn&#x27;t formalized until 1949 after he left. He went on to become the first professor of psychology at his alma mater, University of Oxford, which had just opened a new honors school in psychology, philosophy, and physiology. He prompted the university to establish the Oxford Institute of Experimental Psychology and was named its first director. Humphrey also helped to develop military personnel tests and directed research for the Canadian Army during World War II. In 1956, he retired to Cambridge, England at the age of 67. Though no longer a professor, he continued to give lectures in Germany for the British Embassy.

== Major Contributions and Works ==
Humphrey&#x27;s keen interest in human nature was encouraged by his time spent with Wundt. After the birth of his daughter, Humphrey observed the newborn by holding her out a second story window to see if she would respond with fear. He was then inspired to write several publications concerning the behavior of children. His first book, &quot;The Story of Man&#x27;s Mind&quot; (1932), advocates the significance of experience by referencing the case of the French feral child, Victor of Aveyron, and later wrote (with his wife Muriel Miller) a 1932 translation of Itard&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Boy of Aveyron&quot;.

&quot;The Story of Man&#x27;s Mind&quot; covers several schools of psychological thought including behaviorism, Gestalt psychology, and psychoanalysis. With Freud in his prime, Humphrey expressed skepticism about psychoanalytic theory, arguing that the role of sex was grossly overemphasized in the development of children. He also diminished the theory about the unconscious mind, claiming that much of it can be explained by the nature of conditioned reflexes. However, he did cite the existence of unconscious thought processes in Humphrey&#x27;s Law, which states that automatization of a task (usually in the case of movement) is impaired when a task is performed with conscious effort.

His work on classical conditioning revealed that the context in which a stimulus is presented majorly affects how the subject learns to respond, which he discussed in his second book, &quot;The Nature of Learning&quot; (1933). This book is considered by Queen&#x27;s University to be his most important work. It brought attention to the concept of living organisms being &quot;systems&quot; that are regulated by homeostasis, physiologically and psychologically.

In 1951, he wrote &quot;Thinking: An Introduction to Its Experimental Psychology&quot;, which had considerable success as it provided a written description of all research done on mental problem solving in humans conducted by Otto Selz, the Würzburg School, and other Gestalt psychologists. Their findings largely supported Humphrey&#x27;s assertion—discussed in his book &quot;Directed Thinking&quot; (1948)—that a sequence of thoughts is governed by motivation.

Humphrey thought that mental escapism could have great benefits and was healthy within reason. He particularly believed that watching movies helped &quot;soothe the raw nerves&quot; of people living in a post-war era. To him, escapism provided a means of coping with other aspects of everyday life that were overly restrictive, like work.

Under the alternate pen name Donald MacPherson, Humphrey wrote two other books. &quot;Go Home Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Men Are Like Animals&quot; were science fiction novels that drew from Freudian psychology and were published pseudonymously in 1935 and 1937, respectively.

<text>Collingwood is a town in the north-west corner of the South Island of New Zealand along Golden Bay / Mohua. The town is an ecotourism destination due to its proximity to Kahurangi National Park and Farewell Spit Nature Reserve.

==History==
The town was originally named Gibbstown after the local settler and politician William Gibbs (1817–1897), who arrived in the area in 1851. The settlement was later renamed Collingwood after Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, Lord Nelson&#x27;s second-in-command at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

Following the discovery of payable gold deposits in the Aorere Valley in 1856 the town&#x27;s population surged. The population peaked at an estimated 2500 gold miners. In 1857 police buildings were built. In 1859 there were 3 merchants, 2 shoemakers, a tailor, 2 butchers and 7 inns. Fire damaged the town in 1859. In 1860 the gold rush was over and the miners had moved on to the West Coast of the South Island. In the late 1870s coal mining created a second mining boom for Collingwood.

A suggestion was made that Collingwood should become New Zealand&#x27;s capital. In 1864, three Australian commissioners were tasked with recommending a more central location for the capital and they did visit Golden Bay (then still known as Massacre Bay) but their recommendation was for Wellington.

The town has been damaged by fire several times, being almost destroyed in 1904 which started in the bakery and then spread to the general store. Every building on Tasman Street was destroyed.

In 1930 eight buildings were destroyed in a fire including the Collingwood Hotel and the Presbyterian Church. A fire in 1967 started in the Post Office Hotel and destroyed the hotel and the Memorial Hall. A replacement memorial hall was built in 1972 and contains the Collingwood Library.

HealthPost was founded in 1988 as a mail-order company for natural-health products. It has developed into a significant online retailer and is today the largest employer in Golden Bay.

==Geography==
Collingwood is located along the western shore of Golden Bay at the mouth of the Aorere River. The town is the endpoint for State Highway 60. The road leaving the town to the southwest goes into the Aorere Valley. The road to the north leads to Cape Farewell via a number of small settlements.

<doc id="857466" wikidata="Q1161665" url="?curid=857466" title="Daniel Manning">
<text>Daniel Manning (May 16, 1831 – December 24, 1887) was an American journalist, banker, and politician. A Democrat, he was most notable for his service as the 37th United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1885 to 1887 under President Grover Cleveland.

A native of Albany, New York, Manning began a newspaper career at age 11 and worked his way through the ranks of the &quot;Albany Argus&quot; to become president and publisher. Manning also undertook self-study to compensate for his lack of formal education and became recognized for his expertise in topics as varied as finance and fine art. Manning was also involved in banking and business, and became president of Albany&#x27;s National Commercial Bank.

Manning was active in politics as a Democrat, and attended numerous state and national conventions as a delegate. As chair of the New York Democratic Party, Manning was a key supporter of Grover Cleveland&#x27;s successful campaign for president in 1884. Cleveland appointed Manning Secretary of the Treasury, and he served from 1885 to 1887. As head of the Treasury Department, Manning advised Cleveland on fiscal and economic policy matters. As a trusted advisor, he provided input to Cleveland on political appointments and topics not directly related to his cabinet portfolio.

Manning left the cabinet because of ill health. He served briefly as president of the Western National Bank of New York. He died in Albany on December 24, 1887. Manning was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.

==Early life==
Daniel Manning was born in Albany, New York on May 16, 1831, the son of John and Eleanor (Oley) Manning. Manning&#x27;s siblings included John B. Manning, who served as mayor of Buffalo, New York. He was educated in the local schools, and at age 11 he began working to help support his family, initially as a page for the New York State Assembly. He subsequently accepted a position as an errand boy for the &quot;Albany Atlas&quot; newspaper, which was later renamed the &quot;Albany Argus&quot;.

==Career==
Manning worked his way through the ranks at the &quot;Argus&quot;, including positions as stenographer, reporter, associate editor, editor, publisher, and owner and president. Manning devoted significant time to self-study to make up for his lack of formal education, and developed expertise in political science, banking and finance, and fine art.

In addition to his newspaper interests, Manning was involved in banking and business. He was a trustee of Albany&#x27;s National Savings Bank, and a director of Albany&#x27;s National Commercial Bank. He became vice president of the National Commercial Bank in 1881, and he ascended to the presidency after the 1882 death of Robert H. Pruyn. Manning was also interested in railroads, including serving on the Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad&#x27;s board of directors. In addition, after the invention of the incandescent light bulb, Manning served on the board of directors of the Electric Light Company of Albany. Manning was also a director of the Albany Railway Company, the city&#x27;s street railroad.

===Political career===

A Democrat, for many years Manning was recognized as the leader of the party in Albany. He was a delegate to all the state Democratic conventions from 1874 to 1884. He served as a member of the state Democratic committee from 1874 to 1885, and secretary from 1879 to 1881. From 1881 to 1885, Manning was chair of the New York Democratic Party. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1876, 1880, and 1884. He was chair of the 1880 convention, and head of New York state&#x27;s 1884 delegation. Manning was a friend and political ally of Samuel J. Tilden, and worked with him to oppose the political corruption of Tammany Hall and the Tweed Ring.

During the 1884 United States presidential election, Manning was a leader of Grover Cleveland&#x27;s campaign. At the national convention, he played a key role in obtaining the nomination for Cleveland, and his efforts on Cleveland&#x27;s behalf were credited with aiding Cleveland&#x27;s narrow victory in the general election.

===Secretary of the Treasury===

After Cleveland won the presidency, Tilden advocated Manning&#x27;s appointment as Secretary of the Treasury. Cleveland concurred, and Manning served from March 8, 1885, until resigning because of ill health on March 31, 1887. A fiscal conservative and advocate of the gold standard, as was Cleveland, Manning worked to preserve the Treasury&#x27;s cash surplus and increase its gold reserve. In addition, Manning advocated tariff reduction.

As a cabinet secretary who enjoyed Cleveland&#x27;s confidence, Manning provided advice to Cleveland on fiscal and economic policy. As a trusted political advisor, Manning also provided input to Cleveland on appointees and issues that were not within Treasury&#x27;s usual purview.

===Later life===
After leaving the Treasury Department, Manning accepted appointment as president of the Western National Bank of New York. He died of Bright&#x27;s disease at his home in Albany on December 24, 1887. Manning&#x27;s funeral took place at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Albany, and was attended by President Cleveland and all but one member of the cabinet. He was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands.

==Personal life==

In 1853, Manning married Mary Little, who died in 1882. They were the parents of four children:

* James Hilton Manning (1854–1925), who was editor and manager of the &quot;Albany Argus&quot; and served as mayor of Albany.
* Frederick Clinton Manning (1859–1928), a prominent engraver of Albany.
* Anastasia &quot;Anna&quot; Manning (1861–1933), who married John A. Delehanty.
* Mary Elizabeth Manning (1867–1906), who married Jules C. Van der Oudermeulen.

In 1884, Manning married Mary Margaretta Fryer (1844–1928), the daughter of William John and Margaret Livingston ( Crofts) Fryer, and a descendant of Robert Livingston, the first lord of Livingston Manor. She died at her home in Albany in July 1928.

===Legacy===
An engraved portrait of Manning appears on U.S. paper money, the series 1886 $20 silver certificate. These collectible notes are referred to as &quot;Mannings&quot; or &quot;diamondbacks&quot; due to their unusual reverse design, and because of their rarity they often sell for between $1,000 and $5,000.

In 1898, engraver George T. Morgan created for the United States Mint a commemorative medal depicting Manning. 160 medals were struck and offered for sale. Many are still in circulation, and sell for between $100 and $200 at auction.

In 1898, the Treasury Department&#x27;s United States Revenue Cutter Service commissioned two new ships named for previous Treasury secretaries, one of which was USRC &quot;Daniel Manning&quot;. During her service, &quot;Manning&quot; performed patrol duty off New England and in the Bering Sea. &quot;Manning&quot; was assigned to the United States Navy during the Spanish–American War and took part in an engagement off Cabañas, Cuba. During World War I, &quot;Manning&quot; was based at Gibraltar and escorted trade convoys to England and conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Mediterranean. &quot;Manning&quot; was decommissioned and sold in 1930.

In 1887, Manning received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Columbia University. There is a memorial pillar to Manning at the Cathedral of All Saints in Albany. Albany&#x27;s South Manning Boulevard, Manning Boulevard, and North Manning Boulevard, an extended street that is one of the city&#x27;s main thoroughfares, was named for Manning.

<doc id="857479" wikidata="Q361596" url="?curid=857479" title="Moses Kiptanui">
<text>Moses Kiptanui (born 1 October 1970) is a Kenyan middle and long distance athlete mostly famous for 3000 metres steeplechase in which he was the number one ranked athlete from 1991 to 1995 and three time IAAF World Champion. Kiptanui was the first man to ever run the 3000m steeplechase in under eight minutes. He is also known for his coaching role in his later years with Tarbert GAA.

==Early life, family and education ==
Kiptanui is from Kenya. His younger brother, Philemon Tanui, attended University of Wyoming and ran competitively for the school.

==Career==
Kiptanui emerged in 1991 as a relatively unknown athlete. He won several IAAF Grand Prix races that season. He celebrated an especially spectacular victory in Zürich where he fell on the track on the last lap but still won easily. He was known as a highly confident and somewhat cocky athlete, who was self-coached and driven by his own self belief.

His victory at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics in Tokyo therefore came as no surprise. To the great disappointment of many observers he was not included in the Kenyan team at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Kiptanui had failed to qualify at the Kenyan trials in Nairobi.

However, shortly after the Olympics he set a new world record over 3000m in Cologne with a time of 7:28.96 min. Only three days later he also broke the 3000m steeplechase world record in 8:02.08 in Zürich. The following year, he defended the World Championship title easily in Stuttgart. He won the steeplechase at the 1994 IAAF World Cup.

In 1995, he broke the 5000m world record in Rome in a time of 12:55.30 min (8 June). After collecting his third World Championship gold medal in Gothenburg he also set the new 3000m steeplechase record in Zürich in a time of 7:59.18 min (16 August), the first man in history to ever dip under eight minutes for the 3000m steeplechase.

A year later, he achieved an Olympic silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He was defeated by fellow Kenyan Joseph Keter. The next year, at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics in Athens, Kiptanui failed to win his fourth consecutive gold medal, but took silver. The winner was Wilson Boit Kipketer, also from Kenya.

He was still active in 2001 sighting the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but did not compete there. 

After retirement, he was a running coach. In 2008, he coached the 2004 Olympic gold medalist, Ezekiel Kemboi. He has also been the chairman of the Marakwet District branch of Athletics Kenya.

==Legacy==
A school was built by Shoe4Africa to honor the lifetime achievements of Kiptanui. The Shoe4Africa Moses Kiptanui School was opened in 2012 at Kamoi district, Marakwet and has eight primary classes with 320 students. Two ancillary early childhood development classes were added in 2015.

<doc id="857486" wikidata="Q5035882" url="?curid=857486" title="Capitol Hill, Oklahoma City">
<text>Capitol Hill is a neighborhood of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was originally a separate city that was established in 1905, merging with its larger neighbor in 1911. The neighborhood is located just south of downtown Oklahoma City and borders to the north by the North Canadian River. The North Canadian River is now known as the Oklahoma River for its seven mile course while in Oklahoma City.

The Capitol Hill Urban Design District is an area designated in 1996 by Oklahoma City to maintain the existing historic, architectural and visual character of the area, while at the same time encouraging compatible, quality, new development. Capitol Hill became an official Main Street community in 1997 and today the district enjoys a rich multi-cultural quality

Despite its name, Capitol Hill is a historic business and entertainment district in south Oklahoma City and should not be confused with the capitol campus, which is centered at N. Lincoln Blvd and E. 23rd Street where the state capitol building (of Oklahoma) and other government agencies reside.

==Geography==
The Capitol Hill neighborhood is south of downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and borders the North Canadian River. Popular use of the name &quot;Capitol Hill&quot; extends far beyond the traditionally designated area.

==History==
Capitol Hill was platted in 1900 by Benoni Harrington. The district soon became a center of commerce that boasted of major department stores such as John A. Brown and J.C. Penney. With the introduction of malls, particularly Crossroads Mall, many stores left Capitol Hill. Capitol Hill continued to decay until Capitol Hill Main Street, established in 1997, provided a foundation of economic development, promotion, design and organization that is restoring Capitol Hill to its former glory. Since 1997, the district has garnered $14.8 million in public and private reinvestment.

==Art and culture==
The area is now the center of Hispanic oriented commerce, culture, and nightlife, including the Knob Hill Theater, formally home to the Oklahoma Opry, award winning 250 seat Latino owned experimental and indie rock venue Resonant Head restaurants, bakeries, graphic designers, churches, and service businesses. One of the major employers in the area is the Community Action Agency of Oklahoma and Canadian Counties.

Though the area was annexed by Oklahoma City, it has retained its own chamber of commerce, community newspaper and even its own downtown along Commerce Street.

==Education==
Schools in the Capitol Hill neighborhood are part of the Oklahoma City school district and include Capitol Hill High School and Capitol Hill Middle School School. Capitol Hill High School was established in 1928 and draws students from a number of middle schools. Nearby Adelaide Lee Elementary School serves Kindergarten through 6th grade students.

<doc id="857494" wikidata="Q1065984" url="?curid=857494" title="Charles S. Fairchild">
<text>Charles Stebbins Fairchild (April 30, 1842 – November 24, 1924) was an American businessman and politician who served as United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1887 to 1889 and Attorney General of New York from 1876 to 1877. He was a notable anti-suffragist, challenging the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920 and serving as president of the American Constitutional League.

==Biography==

Charles Stebbins Fairchild was born on April 30, 1842, in Cazenovia, New York, to Helen Childs and Sidney Thompson Fairchild. He attended a local seminary and graduated from Harvard College in 1863, then Harvard Law School in 1865. He then began practicing law in Albany with the firm of Hand, Hale &amp; Swartz; and soon became active in the Democratic Party of New York. He was married to Helen Lincklaen in 1871, and began serving in minor governmental capacities until 1874 when he became Deputy Attorney General of New York. He was involved in the prosecution and eventual conviction of New York City Police Commissioners Oliver Charlick and Hugh Gardner for removing elected inspectors without notice. When Samuel J. Tilden was elected Governor of New York, he directed Fairchild to lead the prosecution of the Canal Ring.

Tilden then backed Fairchild to be Attorney General of New York, first at the Democratic party convention in Syracuse in 1875. He was elected in 1875 and was in office from 1876 to 1877. Fairchild was not reelected and failed to defeat the Canal Ring. In January 1878, he was nominated to be Superintendent of Public Works by Gov. Lucius Robinson, but was rejected by the New York State Senate. He resumed the practice of law until 1885, when he was appointed Assistant U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Fairchild led a commission that overhauled the department, resulting in the firing of hundreds of clerks, changes in methods of bookkeeping and cuts in expenses attributed to the United States Customs House. When Secretary Daniel Manning&#x27;s health forced him to resign in 1887, Fairchild was appointed to succeed, and served in Grover Cleveland&#x27;s administration from 1887 to 1889.

In 1886, the United States Treasury had a surplus of approximately $94 million due to high taxes and custom collections. In an attempt to prevent money from accumulating, Fairchild asked the United States Congress to reduce taxes and allow money to be deposited in banks. After Congress refused both requests, Fairchild began buying back government bonds to dispose of surplus revenue. His action is seen by some as averting a financial crisis. He was removed from office when Grover Cleveland lost reelection in 1888, and refused to return after Cleveland won again in 1892. As a Gold Democrat, he opposed the nomination of William Jennings Bryan for president. 

Fairchild then moved to New York City and was a prominent figure in business and philanthropy. He was involved with the Charity Organization Society. He was President of the New York Security and Trust Company from 1889 to 1904. He was on the board of the American Mechanical Cashier Company (a competitor of NCR) with investment banker Henry L. Horton and Judge Hiram Bond. He was President of the Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railroad and a director of the Erie and Pittsburgh Railroad. He was a prominent figure in the opposition to a &#x27;snap convention&#x27; held by David B. Hill in 1892. Fairchild also served as president of the American Constitutional League (formerly the Men&#x27;s Anti-Suffrage Association).

===&quot;Fairchild v Hughes&quot;===
&quot;Fairchild v. Hughes&quot; was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States decided whether a citizen, in a state that already had women&#x27;s suffrage, had standing to challenge the validity of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. On July 7, 1920, Fairchild challenged the validity of the ratification process for the Nineteenth Amendment in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. The district court dismissed the case on July 20, and Fairchild appealed. On August 26, Hughes acknowledged Tennessee&#x27;s ratification, and the Nineteenth Amendment became law. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court decision. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in November 1922. In February, the Court unanimously decided that Fairchild, as a private citizen, lacked standing to challenge the amendment&#x27;s ratification under the limitations of the Case or Controversy Clause of Article III.

===Later life and death===
Fairchild died on November 24, 1924, at the age of 82, and was buried at the Evergreen Cemetery in Cazenovia, New York. At the time of his death, he was the last living member of the first Cleveland Administration.
Fairchild and his wife lived in the Lorenzo House.
He was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Alpha chapter).

<text>Argyropelecus is an oceanic ray-finned fish genus in the deep sea hatchetfish family Sternoptychidae. A collective name is &quot;[[Marine hatchetfish|silver hatchetfishes]]&quot;, but this can also refer to a species of the freshwater hatchetfishes which are not particularly closely related to this. The large pupils of these marine hatchetfishes enable them to see dim objects in the deep sea, where light barely penetrates.

== Species ==
There are currently seven recognized extant species in this genus:
* &quot;Argyropelecus aculeatus&quot; (lovely hatchetfish, Atlantic silver hatchetfish)
* &quot;Argyropelecus affinis&quot; (Pacific hatchetfish)
* &quot;Argyropelecus gigas&quot; (giant hatchetfish, greater silver hatchetfish)
* &quot;Argyropelecus hemigymnus&quot; (half-naked hatchetfish, short silver hatchetfish, spurred hatchetfish)
* &quot;Argyropelecus lychnus&quot; (tropical hatchetfish)
* &quot;Argyropelecus olfersii&quot; 
* &quot;Argyropelecus sladeni&quot; (Sladen&#x27;s hatchetfish, silvery hatchetfish)

The earliest unequivocal fossils of &quot;Argyropelecus&quot; date from the start of the Chattian stage of the Late Oligocene The original assessment of Eocene-aged otoliths from Austria assigned to this genus is now questioned.

<doc id="857510" wikidata="Q4806026" url="?curid=857510" title="Ashton Court Festival">
<text>The Ashton Court Festival was an outdoor music festival held annually in mid-July on the grounds of Ashton Court, just outside Bristol, England. The festival was a weekend event which featured a variety of local bands and national headliners. Mainly aimed at local residents, the festival did not have overnight camping facilities and was financed by donations and benefit gigs.

Starting as a small one-day festival in 1974, the festival grew during succeeding years and was said to be Britain&#x27;s largest free festival until changes brought on by government legislation resulted in compulsory fees and security fencing being introduced. After problems were caused by a temporary move to Hengrove Park in 2001, due to the foot and mouth crisis, and a washout in 2007, the organisers declared bankruptcy in 2007.

==History==
===Origins===
The first festival was held in 1974, organised by Royce Creasey and friends, as a small event, for the local musicians to entertain the local community. The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a flat bed truck. Bristol City Council donated £50. The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to Ashton Court mansion. After this, new organisers came on board and fund-raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s.

===1980===
In 1980, large numbers of people from far afield attended, trees were damaged and burnt and there was illegal camping and lurid press reports of drugs and nudity. It was not until 1983 that the festival recommenced. when it was a one-day event; in 1984 a &quot;de facto&quot; two-day event was created by staging it back-to-back with a one-day WOMAD event. The festival took place in a large sloped clearing surrounded on three sides by New Barn Wood and Clarken Coombe. The main stage was placed at the bottom of the slope and the second stage in a natural amphitheatre near the entrance to the clearing. There were many other performance spaces, varying from year to year, including a dance tent, marquees for world music, acoustic acts and performing arts, and the &quot;Blackout&quot; tent for experimental music and video, as well as a children&#x27;s area and funfair rides. Camping on the festival site was not allowed.

===21st century===

In 2001 the Bristol Community Festival temporarily relocated to Hengrove Park in the south of the city. Ashton Court Estate, which includes a deer park, was closed as a quarantine measure due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease that affected the United Kingdom that year. The move caused a massive drop in attendance and a heavy financial loss, leading to debts which hung over the organisation. This, along with changes to licensing laws and tightening health and safety requirements, led to a more commercial style of organisation, with a compulsory entrance fee and a strict security presence around the perimeter fence. This attracted criticism from some locals who felt that the &quot;community&quot; nature of the festival had been lost. Even so, the festival continued to be run by volunteers on a not-for-profit basis.

In 2003 the weight and vibrations of crowds returning from the Ashton Court Festival and the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta put such a great strain on the Clifton Suspension Bridge that the Bridge Trustees decided to close the bridge to all traffic, including pedestrians, for the entirety of the festival and most of the Balloon Fiesta in 2004 and 2005.

===Crisis===
In December 2006 it was announced that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place. The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses. In June 2007 it was announced that alcohol would not be allowed to be taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena. Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy.

Although locals have long referred to the festival as the &quot;Ashton Court Festival&quot;, before 2004 it was officially called the Bristol Community Festival. Since then it became increasingly popular, and for several years it was claimed to be Britain&#x27;s biggest free festival; however, the &quot;suggested minimum donation&quot; for entry become a gradually increasing compulsory entry fee. From 2007, children (aged 10–16) also had to pay an entry fee, while under 10s remained free (previously all children got in free), and a new discounted weekend ticket became available. The festival was typically attended by over 60,000 people annually.

In the festival&#x27;s last year, 2007, the site was moved to Smythe&#x27;s field in front of Ashton Court Mansion. On the second day, the event was cancelled due to torrential rain, which made the site inaccessible to emergency vehicles. &quot;The health and safety of our audience is what is important,&quot; said organiser Steve Hunt. Over 80 bands were due to perform that day, including Damon Albarn&#x27;s The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen. The cancellation increased the pressure on the already strained finances of the festival. On Friday 20 July 2007 Bristol Community Festival Ltd, the not-for-profit company which organised the event, announced that it had started the process of winding up the company due to unsustainable financial losses.

==Notable performers==
The festival&#x27;s music policy always focused on local acts, but since the late 1990s there was a move towards attracting national acts to headline the festival. Major acts at Ashton Court in recent years include:
* Steve Hillage in 1978
* The Only Ones in 1978
``* Portishead in 1998.
* Feeder and Rae &amp; Christian in 1999.
* Mad Professor, Kosheen and Stereo MC&#x27;s in 2001.
* Reef and Kosheen and Dirty Drugs in 2002.
* Robert Plant, McKay and The Electric Soft Parade in 2003.
* The Stranglers, Goldie Lookin&#x27; Chain and Glenn Tilbrook in 2004.
* Super Furry Animals, Lemon Jelly, Roni Size and Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel in 2005.
* Simple Minds, The Go! Team, Plan B in 2006.
* The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, The Fall, Gravenhurst in 2007.

==Legacy==
Following the end of Bristol Community Festival, other groups emerged hoping to continue with some sort of summer festival in Bristol. Bristol Music Festival became the Bristol Festival (now BrisFest) and has so far successfully put on four summer festivals, albeit in the city centre. 2011 saw the most successful even yet, with over 25,000 people attending over three days.

BrisFest returned to Ashton Court in 2012 and 2013, however announced in December 2013 that they would not be continuing the festival into 2014.

The event returned in 2015 and 2016 as part of the &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock Bristol&quot; retro festival.

<doc id="857516" wikidata="Q309386" url="?curid=857516" title="Beyblade (manga)">
<text>Beyblade, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by to promote sales of spinning tops called &quot;Beyblades&quot; developed as a co-production between Takara Tomy and Hasbro. The series focuses on a group of kids who form teams, which battle one another using Beyblades. Originally serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; from September 1999 to July 2004, the individual chapters were collected and published in 14 volumes and was licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media. It was licensed for English releases in Singapore and in Australia and New Zealand by Chuang Yi.

An anime adaptation aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from January to December 2001 and was followed by two sequel series, &quot;Beyblade V-Force&quot; and &quot;Beyblade G-Revolution&quot;, and the 2002 film &quot;&quot;. Nelvana licensed and produced English-language adaptations of the anime series and the film.

== Plot and characters ==
=== &quot;Beyblade&quot; ===
Tyson Granger is an enthusiastic teenage boy who loves Beyblade. He begins his journey after befriending fellow Beyblade enthusiast, Kenny, and drawing the attention of Kai Hiwatari, a formidable Blader, after defeating Carlos, the leader of his neighborhood&#x27;s Beyblade gang, the Blade Sharks. Tyson and Kai develop a rivalry that leads to him discovering that his Beyblade contains a Bit-Beast named Dragoon. Seeking to challenge Kai again, Tyson competes in the Japanese Regional Beyblade Qualifying Tournament and befriends fellow competitors, Ray Kon and Max Tate, both of whom possess their own Bit-Beast.

After winning the tournament, Tyson goes on to form a team with Kai, Ray and Max named the Bladebreakers. Kenny tags along as their manager. The Bladebreakers tour China to register for the championships and confront the White Tigers, Ray&#x27;s former team, who hold a grudge against Ray for leaving them. Toward the end of the Chinese tournament, Ray and his ex-teammates make amends, and the Bladebreakers win the tournament.

After this, Tyson and his friends arrive in the United States to fight the All Starz, who are coached by Max&#x27;s mother. After winning the American League, the team finds itself stranded in Europe. They tour Europe and meet Oliver, Enrique, Johnny and Robert, who go by the name Majestics.

The Bladebreakers battle the Majestics and the Bladebreakers win the battle. They then go to Russia for the final tournament. In Russia, they meet Boris&#x27;s team, the Demolition Boys, of which Kai was also a member of in the past. Kai had forgotten about Boris and the training grounds where he had learned almost everything he knew about Beyblading. However, he soon regains his memory. He finds Black Dranzer, his dream Beyblade, and decides to join the Demolition Boys team, aiming to be the best Beyblader. Tyson finds out and tries to convince Kai to return to the Bladebreakers, but Kai rejects him, throwing his old Beyblade, Dranzer, at Tyson&#x27;s feet. Tyson keeps Dranzer with him and vows to bring Kai back. Soon, before the finals, Kai challenges the Bladebreakers to steal their Bit-Beasts and become most powerful Blader. However, only Tyson and Ray show up. Max is still at the airport, returning from where he was training with Tyson and Ray with his new Beyblade, Draciel. Just at the moment when Kai seems to be close to taking the Bit-Beasts of Tyson and Ray, Max comes and challenges Kai. Kai thinks that he can easily beat Draciel but he can not, and soon Tyson uses Kai&#x27;s own old Blade, Dranzer, to beat the Black Dranzer and defeat Kai. Kai, shocked by the power of Dranzer, does not notice the ice beneath him cracking and falls into the frozen water below. Tyson, Ray, Max and Kenny rescue Kai. Realizing the power of friendship as well as the power of Dranzer, Kai returns to the Bladebreakers.

In the final match, Tyson battles Tala, winning the match and becoming a Beyblade World Champion for the first time.

=== &quot;Beyblade V-Force&quot; ===
The Bladebreakers have gone their separate ways. But when Team Psykick and the Saint Shields attack the Bladebreakers and try to steal their Bit-Beasts, the Bladebreakers reassemble to defeat the new enemies. Tyson and Kenny&#x27;s classmate Hilary Tachibana (Hiromi Tachibana) joins the Bladebreakers but takes time to learn that Beyblade is not just the stupid game she thinks it is.

In an attempt to steal the four Bit-Beasts from the Bladebreakers, Team Psykick creates four cyber Bit-Beast copies of the Bladebreakers&#x27; Bit-Beasts and recruit four skilled bladers named Kane, Salima, Goki, and Jim. These teenagers were pure-hearted and innocent bladers with high ambitions, but the dark power of the cyber Bit-Beasts gradually take over their minds and turn them evil. The first half of the second season ends with the Bladebreakers defeating Team Psykick. Tyson, Ray, Kai and Max battle Kane, Salima, Goki and Jim respectively and defeat them. After the cyber beasts are destroyed Team Psykick come back to their normal selves and regain consciousness. The second half of Season 2 deals with the truth of why the Saint Shields and Team Psykick are after Bladebreakers&#x27; Bit-Beasts and about a rock that Max&#x27;s mother found that contains Bit-Beasts, which is stolen by Team Psykick.

The Saint Shields&#x27; reason behind attempting to steal the Bit-Beasts is because they wish to seal them in a rock because they fear that the Bit-Beasts could get out of control like they did in the past. The Saint Shields battle the Bladebreakers and manage to seal Ray&#x27;s Bit-Beast Driger into a sealing stone. Later Ray reclaims Driger and defeats all the Saint Shields in a team face-off. The Psykick&#x27;s leader, Dr. Zagart, wants the Bit-Beasts to turn his android son Zeo (an exact replica of his son who died in an accident) into a real human.

After defeating the Saint Shields, Tyson meets Zeo and befriends him without knowing that he is the son of Team Psykick&#x27;s leader. Zeo is unaware that he is an android and that his father is behind all of Team Psykick&#x27;s plans. Later Zeo finds out about his past and decides to help his father in his plans. Dr. Zagart gives Zeo a bit beast named Cerberus, the strongest Bit-Beast sealed in the rock. Zeo enters the world Beyblade tournament with the motive of defeating all the Bladebreakers members and stealing their Bit-Beasts. In the tournament, Zeo defeats Kai and Max and steals their Bit-Beasts Dranzer and Draciel. But in the final battle Tyson and Dragoon (Tyson&#x27;s Bit-Beast) defeat Zeo and Cerberus. In the process, Tyson and Max&#x27;s team win the world tournament. Dranzer and Draciel come back to their original bladers, Kai and Max.

=== &quot;Beyblade G-Revolution&quot; ===
Kai, Ray, and Max left Tyson and went their separate ways to rejoin their old teams so that they have a chance to beat each other at the World Championship which has been re-designed with tag-teams of two. Max joins the PPB All Starz, Ray joins White Tiger X, and Kai joins the Blitzkrieg Boys. This leaves only Tyson, Hilary, and Kenny on the team. A new character, Daichi Sumeragi, and Tyson&#x27;s older brother, Hiro Granger, join them. The two other teams involved are the Barthez Battalion and F-Dynasty.

One week after the results of the World Championships, Boris, the secondary villain from the first season, returns and creates the new Beyblade Entertainment Global Association, (BEGA) replacing the BBA. Boris tries to fool Tyson and co. into believing he has made up for his past, while he is actually trying to gain control over all Bladers and Beyblading activity. After a while however, they see what Boris is trying to pull. Tyson challenges BEGA&#x27;s best to a battle, and Boris decides to hold a 5-on-5 tournament in one month&#x27;s time. But he declares that all the Beyblade shops must sell Beyblades and their parts to BEGA associated Beybladers only, otherwise they will not be allowed to run the shops.

Tyson and the team find some parts at Max&#x27;s father&#x27;s store, which are insufficient. Then after sometime Kenny comes with the solution, he makes a new type of Beyblades known as hard metal Beyblades, using a different type of parts. But they still needed one more blader, and that is when Kai, who tried to join BEGA but lost severely to Brooklyn, disbanded the Blitzkrieg Boys and rejoined the team now known as the G Revolutions. Additionally during the BEGA qualifying matches Kai&#x27;s former teammates, Spencer and Bryan of the Blitzkrieg Boys defeat a BEGA Training squad but lose easily to a mysterious blader known as Garland Siebald. Tala, the leader of the Blitzkrieg Boys who was previously the final boss in season 1, takes on Garland but lost the match and was seriously injured after Garland activated his attack, Radiant Thunder and ended the match. Daichi and Ray lose the first two matches to Ming-Ming and Crusher only proving that their hard metal blades were also no match for their powerful blades. Max ends the third match with Mystel in a draw. Then it is Kai&#x27;s turn. He chooses unbeaten Brooklyn as his Opponent. Kai defeats Brooklyn in that match. Then Tyson beats Garland. Brooklyn becomes insane due to his loss to Kai and start having nightmares about Kai. After that, he confronts Tyson. In the ensuing match, Tyson and Brooklyn battle it out in the tie-breaker match. As the final fight rages on, Brooklyn goes berserk and merges with his bit-beast Zeus which threatens to destroy the entire universe. in the end Tyson is able to absorb the powers of every single Bit-Beast and after a final attack, Brooklyn became normal while both blades were still spinning (but the match after that was not shown assumed as a draw). And the BEGA corporation had fallen thanks to the efforts of the Bladebreakers (G-Revolutions). The episode ends with Tyson and Kai to have one final match.

In the Japanese version, the episode ends with a special ending showing every major character from the series.

=== &quot;Beyblade Rising&quot; ===
Kai returns to Japan after completing his studies. Tyson learns of this and tries to meet Kai, but when he reaches there he finds that Kai has left beyblading and is now controlling his grandfather&#x27;s company. Tyson is shocked to hear this. He understands that Kai is abandoning his passion just to keep his grandpa, Voltaire&#x27;s will. Tyson makes Kai understand and listen to his inner voice. Voltaire at last understands his mistake and allows Kai to carry on his journey. Tyson challenges Kai for a beybattle. Kai is about to be defeated when he uses his beyblading skills and defeats Tyson. Tyson and others are shocked but he is glad to find his friend back to action.

<text>In the anatomy of the eye, the conjunctiva (: conjunctivae) is a thin mucous membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the sclera (the white of the eye). It is composed of non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium with goblet cells, stratified columnar epithelium and stratified cuboidal epithelium (depending on the zone). The conjunctiva is highly vascularised, with many microvessels easily accessible for imaging studies.

== Structure ==
The conjunctiva is typically divided into three parts:
===Blood supply===
Blood to the bulbar conjunctiva is primarily derived from the ophthalmic artery. The blood supply to the palpebral conjunctiva (the eyelid) is derived from the external carotid artery. However, the circulations of the bulbar conjunctiva and palpebral conjunctiva are linked, so both bulbar conjunctival and palpebral conjunctival vessels are supplied by both the ophthalmic artery and the external carotid artery, to varying extents.

===Nerve supply===
Sensory innervation of the conjunctiva is divided into four parts:

===Microanatomy===
The conjunctiva consists of unkeratinized, both stratified squamous and stratified columnar epithelium, with interspersed goblet cells. The epithelial layer contains blood vessels, fibrous tissue, and lymphatic channels. Accessory lacrimal glands in the conjunctiva constantly produce the aqueous portion of tears. Additional cells present in the conjunctival epithelium include melanocytes, T and B cell lymphocytes.

== Function ==
The conjunctiva helps lubricate the eye by producing mucus and tears, although a smaller volume of tears than the lacrimal gland.
It also contributes to immune surveillance and helps to prevent the entrance of microbes into the eye.

==Clinical significance==

Disorders of the conjunctiva and cornea are common sources of eye complaints, in particular because the surface of the eye is exposed to various external influences and is especially susceptible to trauma, infections, chemical irritation, allergic reactions, and dryness.
* The conjunctival microvascular hemodynamics are affected by diabetic retinopathy (DR), hence can be useful for DR diagnosis and monitoring, and discriminating stages of DR.
* Type II diabetes is associated with conjunctival hypoxia, increased average blood vessel diameter, and capillary loss.
* Sickle-cell anemia is associated with blood vessel sludging, altered blood flow and blood vessel diameter, and capillary micro-haemorrhages.
* Hypertension is associated with an increase in the tortuosity of bulbar conjunctival blood vessels and capillary and arteriole loss.
* Carotid artery occlusion is associated with slower conjunctival blood flow and apparent capillary loss.
* With age, the conjunctiva can stretch and loosen from the underlying sclera, leading to the formation of conjunctival folds, a condition known as conjunctivochalasis.
* The conjunctiva can be affected by tumors which can be benign, pre-malignant or malignant.
* Leptospirosis, an infection with Leptospira, can cause conjunctival suffusion, which is characterized by chemosis, and redness without exudates.

== Bulbar conjunctival microvasculature ==
=== Vessel morphology ===
The bulbar conjunctival microvasculature contains arterioles, meta-arterioles, venules, capillaries, and communicating vessels. Vessel morphology varies greatly between subjects and even between regions of the individual eyes. In some subjects, arterioles and venules can be seen to run parallel with each other. Paired arterioles are generally smaller than corresponding venules. The average bulbar conjunctival vessel has been reported to be 15.1 microns, which reflects the high number of small capillaries, which are typically &lt;10 microns in diameter.

=== Blood oxygen dynamics ===
The bulbar conjunctival microvasculature is in close proximity to ambient air, thus oxygen diffusion from ambient air strongly influences their blood oxygen saturation. Because of oxygen diffusion, hypoxic bulbar conjunctival vessels will rapidly reoxygenate (in under 10 seconds) when exposed to ambient air (i.e. when the eyelid is open). Closing the eyelid stops this oxygen diffusion by placing a barrier between the bulbar conjunctival microvessels and ambient air.

=== Blood vessel imaging methods ===
The bulbar conjunctival microvessels are typically imaged with a high-magnification slit lamp with green filters. With such high-magnification imaging systems, it is possible to see groups of individual red blood cells flowing in vivo. Fundus cameras may also be used for low-magnification wide field-of-view imaging of the bulbar conjunctival microvasculature. Modified fundus cameras have been used to measure conjunctival blood flow and to measure blood oxygen saturation. Fluorescein angiography has been used to study the blood flow of the bulbar conjunctiva and to differentiate the bulbar conjunctival and episcleral microcirculation.

=== Vasodilation ===
The bulbar conjunctival microvasculature is known to dilate in response to several stimuli and external conditions, including allergens (e.g. pollen), temperature, time-of-day, contact-lens wear, and acute mild hypoxia. Bulbar conjunctival vasodilation has also been shown to correlate changes in emotional state.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increase in average bulbar conjunctival vessel diameter and capillary loss. Sickle-cell anemia is associated with altered average vessel diameter.

<text>The Northern Ireland Office (NIO; , Ulster-Scots: &quot;Norlin Airlann Oaffis&quot;) is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for handling Northern Ireland affairs. The NIO is led by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and is based at Erskine House in Belfast City Centre and 1 Horse Guards Road in London.

==Responsibilities==
The NIO&#x27;s role is to &quot;maintain and support&quot; the devolution settlement resulting from the Good Friday Agreement and St Andrews Agreement and the devolution of criminal justice and policing to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
The department has responsibility for:
* electoral law
* human rights and equality
* national security in Northern Ireland
* the UK Government&#x27;s approach to the legacy of the Troubles

It also represents Northern Irish interests at UK Government level and the interests of the UK Government in Northern Ireland.

The Northern Ireland Office has a close working relationship with the Government of Ireland as a co-guarantor of the peace process; this includes the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and its joint secretariat.

In the Irish Government, the NIO&#x27;s main counterparts are:
* the Department of Foreign Affairs (on the peace process);
* the Department of the Taoiseach (supporting the role of the Taoiseach in the peace process);
* the Department of Justice (on national security matters and the legacy of the Troubles);
* the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (on electoral law).

==History==
After partition in 1924 the Dublin Castle administration was largely replaced by the Parliament of Northern Ireland with the Northern Ireland Department of the Home Office handling the oversight from London, with some extremely important decisions such as sending of British Army soldiers to Northern Ireland in 1969 being made by the Home Secretary. In March 1972 with the Troubles worsening and the UK Government losing confidence in the Northern Ireland Government, direct rule from Westminster was introduced.

The formation of the NIO put Northern Ireland on the same level as Scotland and Wales, where the Scottish Office and Welsh Office were established in 1885 and 1965 respectively. The NIO assumed policing and justice powers from the Ministry of Home Affairs. NIO junior ministers were placed in charge of other Northern Ireland Civil Service departments.

Direct rule was seen as a temporary measure, with a power-sharing devolution preferred as the solution. Under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland replaced the Governor of Northern Ireland and direct rule was annually renewed by a vote in Parliament.

The Sunningdale Agreement in 1973 resulted in a brief, power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive, which was ended by the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike on 28 May 1974. The Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention (1975–1976) and Northern Ireland Assembly (1982–1986) were unsuccessful in restoring devolved government. After the Anglo-Irish Agreement on 15 November 1985, the UK Government and Irish Government co-operated more closely on security and political matters.

Following the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April 1998, devolution returned to Northern Ireland on 2 December 1999. The Northern Ireland Executive was suspended on 15 October 2002 and direct rule returned until devolution was restored on 8 May 2007.

The devolution of policing and justice powers on 12 April 2010 transferred many of the NIO&#x27;s previous responsibilities to the Northern Ireland Assembly and its devolved government, the Northern Ireland Executive. The Department of Justice is now responsible for those matters. This transfer of power resulted in a smaller Northern Ireland Office, comparable to the Scotland Office and Wales Office.

==Ministers==
The NIO ministers are as follows, with cabinet members in bold:

As Attorney General for England and Wales, The Lord Hermer PC KC is Advocate General for Northern Ireland, advising the UK Government on Northern Ireland law.

=== Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland ===

The department is led by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

=== Ministers of State for Northern Ireland ===
=== Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland ===
=== Permanent Secretary ===
The senior civil servant in the NIO is Julie Harrison, who was appointed in September 2023.

<doc id="857523" wikidata="Q7148150" url="?curid=857523" title="Patrons of Industry in Manitoba">
<text>The [[Patrons of Industry]] in Manitoba was an extension of a farmers&#x27; organization operating in Ontario (see Patrons of Industry) and the United States in the 1880s and 1890s. The Patrons lobbied extensively and became politically active, running provincial and federal candidates.

The Manitoba Patrons, as a fraternal organization, was initially focused on coordinating an agrarian cooperative movement on the Prairies.

Its first lodges in Manitoba and the North-West Territories began in 1890, with a &quot;grand lodge&quot; (central body) established in 1891. At first the group was known as the &quot;Patrons of Manitoba and the North-West&quot; - its conventions included delegates from Manitoba and the territorial districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The organization&#x27;s leader was Charles Braithwaite, who was chosen at a convention held in November 1891.

Through direct bulk buying in competition with established stores, the movement brought down the price of farm supplies (binder twine) and other farmers&#x27; needs, and through strong lobbying it helped achieve a cut in tariffs on imported goods important to farmers.

The Manitoba group turned to direct political action in 1894. Following a tour of Manitoba by Braithwaite (who was a spellbinding orator), the Patrons nominated candidates in all but two of the province&#x27;s constituencies, in anticipation of the next provincial election.

The Patrons were the first &quot;third party&quot; to emerge in Manitoba after partisan government was formally introduced to the province in 1888. They opposed both Conservatives and Liberals and were for a time affiliated with Dalton McCarthy, a dissident federal Conservative.

On August 23, 1894, the Patrons proved they were a significant force in Manitoba politics when their candidate John Forsyth defeated Conservative leader John Andrew Davidson in a two-sided Beautiful Plains by-election (there was no Liberal candidate in the race). Forsyth was expelled from the Patrons in 1895 for using a railway pass (given free to legislators) in violation of party policy.

Patrons of Industry made an appearance in the 1894 NWT Assembly election, running J.E. Annable in the Moose Jaw district - unsuccessfully.

The party became internally divided over the Manitoba Schools Question. Many Catholic Patrons were alienated by the party&#x27;s support of Liberal Premier Thomas Greenway&#x27;s efforts to eliminate denominational schools, and left the party.

The Patrons ran seven candidates in the provincial election of 1896, and two of them were elected: Watson Crosby in Dennis and William Sirett in Beautiful Plains.

The Patrons ran candidates in two Manitoba provincial by-elections in 1896 who were not successful. (On the other hand, Matt McCauley was elected with official Patron backing in Edmonton (Alberta) in the 1896 North-West Assembly election.) 

Three Manitoba Patrons -- Postlethwaite (Brandon), Braithwaite (Macdonald), and Marshall (Marquette) -- ran in the 1896 federal election, but were unsuccessful, finishing third in their ridings.

Braithwaite, who had led the Manitoba Patrons of Industry party since 1891, stepped down as party leader in January 1897, and the party effectively ceased to exist after this time. PI MLA Crosby died in 1897, and PI MLA Sirett did not run for re-election in 1899.

In addition to supporting agrarian interests, the Patrons also supported prohibition, universal suffrage (for men and women) and electoral reform. These policies would later re-emerge in the platform of the Progressive Party of Canada and other farmer political parties such as the United Farmers of Manitoba and the United Farmers of Alberta.

<text>Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (APCCCR) was a leftist split from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The leader of the group was T. Nagi Reddy, who was a member of the legislative assembly in AP at the time. Other leading figures were D.V. Rao, Chandra Pulla Reddy and Kolla Venkaiah. Both Reddy and Rao had been active in the Telangana armed struggle, and Rao had formulated the &quot;Andhra Thesis&quot; of the Communist Party of India (CPI).

APCCCR split from CPI(M) after the CPI(M) Burdwan plenum in April 1968. When APCCCR split from CPI(M) 11 of 14 district committees of CPI(M) in Andhra Pradesh sided with APCCCR. Around 60% of the CPI(M) membership in the state, 8000 people (according to an estimate made by CPI(M) leader P. Sundarayya), went over to the T. Nagi Reddy group. They were also able to win over the CPI(M) publication &quot;Janashakti&quot;.

APCCCR was affiliated to the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (AICCCR), but the group got expelled due to political differences. APCCCR advocated a mass line, whereas AICCCR denounced work in trade unions as &quot;economism&quot;. APCCCR saw the issue of participating or boycotting elections as a tactical issue, whereas AICCCR saw as a strategic one. AICCCR accused APCCCR of lack of loyalty towards the Chinese Communist Party.

After the expulsion of APCCCR from AICCCR, AICCCR rapidly reorganized an Andhra branch, mainly drawing support from the Srikakulam region. The Srikakulam District Committee of APCCCR joined Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)).

APCCCR launched limited armed struggles in Warangal, Khammam, Karimnagar, Nalgonda, East Godavari, etc.. APCCCR favoured combining mass movements and armed struggle, and opposed the annihilation line of CPI(ML).

In April 1969 APCCCR issued a resolution called &quot;Boycott Panchayat Elections - Establishing Village Soviets&quot;.

In December 1969 six out nine State Committee members of APCCCR were arrested at a hotel in Madras, among them T. Nagi Reddy and D.V. Rao. The arrests were a heavy blow for the organization. In July 1970 a new state committee led by Chandra Pulla Reddy was created.

APCCCR was later renamed as Andhra Pradesh Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (alt. Andhra Pradesh Revolutionary Communist Committee).

In 1971 APCCR suffered a severe split, with the Chandra Pulla Reddy-led group leaving the party. This group also used the name APCCR. This group merged with the Provisional Central Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) of Satayanarayan Singh in 1973.

In 1975 APCCR formed Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist-Leninist) together with Northern Zone Committee Revolutionary Communist Unity Centre (Marxist-Leninist), West Bengal Communist Unity Centre and West Bengal Co-ordination Committee of Revolutionaries (WBCCR).

<doc id="857536" wikidata="Q375356" url="?curid=857536" title="Dick Cavett">
<text>Richard Alva Cavett (; born November 19, 1936) is an American television personality and former talk show host. He appeared regularly on nationally broadcast television in the United States from the 1960s through the 2000s.

In later years, Cavett has written an online column for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, promoted DVDs of his former shows as well as a book of his &quot;Times&quot; columns, and hosted replays of his TV interviews with Bette Davis, Lucille Ball, Salvador Dalí, Lee Marvin, Groucho Marx, Katharine Hepburn, Judy Garland, Marlon Brando, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Mitchum, John Lennon, George Harrison, Jimi Hendrix, Richard Burton, Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni, Kirk Douglas and others on Turner Classic Movies.

==Early life and education==
Cavett was born in Buffalo County, Nebraska, but sources differ as to the specific town, locating his birthplace in either Gibbon, where his family lived, or nearby Kearney, the location of the nearest hospital. Cavett has said that his birth certificate gives Kearney as his birthplace, but has given conflicting answers on whether he was actually born there.

His mother, Erabel &quot;Era&quot; (née Richards), and his father, Alva B. Cavett, both worked as teachers. When asked by Lucille Ball on his own show about his heritage, he said he was &quot;Scottish, Irish, English, and possibly partly French, and ... a dose of German.&quot; He also mentioned that one grandfather &quot;came over&quot; from England, and the other from Wales. Cavett&#x27;s grandparents all lived in Grand Island, Nebraska. His paternal grandparents were Alva A. Cavett and Gertrude Pinsch. His paternal grandfather was from Diller, Nebraska, and his paternal grandmother was an immigrant from Aachen, Germany, which is why he also speaks fluent German. His maternal grandparents were the Rev. R. R. and Etta Mae Richards. The Rev. Mr. Richards was from Carmarthen, Wales, and was a Baptist minister who served parishes across central Nebraska. Cavett himself is a self-described agnostic.

Cavett&#x27;s parents taught in Comstock, Gibbon, and Grand Island, where Cavett started kindergarten at Wasmer Elementary School. Three years later, both of his parents landed teaching positions in Lincoln, Nebraska, where Cavett completed his education at Capitol, Prescott, and Irving schools and Lincoln High School. When Cavett was ten, his mother died of cancer at age 36. His father subsequently married Dorcas Deland, also a teacher, originally from Alliance, Nebraska. On September 24, 1995, Lincoln Public Schools dedicated the new Dorcas C. and Alva B. Cavett Elementary School in their honor.

In eighth grade, Cavett directed a live Saturday-morning radio show sponsored by the Junior League and played the title role in &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;. One of his high-school classmates was actress Sandy Dennis. Cavett was elected president of the student council in high school, and was a gold medalist at the state gymnastics championship.

Before leaving for college, he worked as a caddie at the Lincoln Country Club. He also began performing magic shows for $35 a night under the tutelage of Gene Gloye. In 1952, Cavett attended the convention of the International Brotherhood of Magicians in St. Louis, Missouri, and won the Best New Performer trophy. Around the same time, he met fellow magician Johnny Carson, 11 years his senior, who was doing a magic act at a church in Lincoln.

While attending Yale University, Cavett played in and directed dramas on the campus radio station, WYBC, and appeared in Yale drama productions. In his senior year, he changed his major from English to drama, graduating in 1958. He also took advantage of any opportunity to meet stars, routinely going to shows in New York to hang around stage doors or venture backstage. He would go so far as to carry a copy of &quot;Variety&quot; or an appropriate piece of company stationery in order to look inconspicuous while sneaking backstage or into a TV studio. Cavett took many odd jobs ranging from store detective to label typist for a Wall Street firm, and as a copyboy at &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Career==

=== Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association ===
in 1956, Cavett joined the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, which is based in Ashland, Oregon, for its 16th season. Cavett appeared as the Bishop of Ely and the second murderer in &quot;Tragedy of Richard the Third&quot;; a page to the king in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;; servant Gregory in &quot;The Tragedy of Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;; a lord in &quot;The Tragedy of Cymbeline&quot;; and Quintus, son of Titus, in &quot;The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus&quot;.

===&quot;The Tonight Show&quot;===
Cavett was cast in a film by the Signal Corps, but further jobs were not forthcoming. He was an extra on &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; in 1959, a TV remake of the film &quot;Body and Soul&quot; for the &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot; the same year, and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (&quot;The Hiding Place&quot;) in 1960. He briefly revived his magic act while working as a typist and as a mystery shopper in department stores. 

Cavett was a copyboy (gofer) at &quot;Time&quot; magazine when he read a newspaper item about Jack Paar, then host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. The article described Paar&#x27;s concerns about his opening monologue and constant search for material. Cavett wrote some jokes, put them into a &quot;Time&quot; envelope, and went to the RCA Building. He ran into Paar in a hallway and handed him the envelope. He then went to sit in the studio audience. During the show, Paar worked in some of the lines that Cavett had fed him.

Afterward, Cavett got into an elevator with Paar, who invited him to contribute more jokes. Within weeks, Cavett was hired, originally as talent coordinator. Cavett wrote for Paar the famous line &quot;Here they are, Jayne Mansfield&quot; as an introduction for the buxom actress.

Cavett appeared on the show in 1961, acting as interpreter for Miss Universe of 1961, Marlene Schmidt of Germany.

While at &quot;Time&quot;, Cavett wrote a letter to film comedian Arthur Jefferson, better known as Stan Laurel of the comedy team Laurel and Hardy. The two soon met at Laurel&#x27;s Hollywood apartment. On the evening of that first visit, Cavett wrote a tribute to him that Paar read on his show. Laurel saw the broadcast which he deeply appreciated. Cavett visited the legendary comedian several times. Their final time together came three weeks prior to Laurel&#x27;s death in 1965.

In his capacity as talent coordinator for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Cavett was sent to the Blue Angel nightclub to see Woody Allen&#x27;s act, and immediately afterward struck up a friendship. The very next day, the funeral of playwright George S. Kaufman was held at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home. Allen could not attend, but Cavett did, where he met Groucho Marx in an anteroom. From the funeral, Cavett followed Marx (who later told Cavett that Kaufman was &quot;his personal god&quot;) three blocks up Fifth Avenue to the Plaza Hotel, where Marx invited him to lunch.

Years later, Cavett gave the introduction to Marx&#x27;s one-man show &quot;An Evening with Groucho Marx&quot; at Carnegie Hall and began by saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe that I know Groucho Marx.&quot;

Cavett continued with &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; as a writer after Johnny Carson assumed hosting duties. For Carson he wrote the quip &quot;Having your taste criticized by Dorothy Kilgallen is like having your clothes criticized by Emmett Kelly.&quot; Cavett appeared on the show once, to do a gymnastics routine on the pommel horse. After departing &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Cavett wrote for Jerry Lewis&#x27;s ill-fated talk show.

===Stand-up comic===
Cavett began a brief career as a stand-up comic in 1964 at The Bitter End in Greenwich Village. His manager was Jack Rollins. One of his jokes from this period was:

Cavett also played Mr. Kelly&#x27;s in Chicago and Enrico Banducci&#x27;s hungry i in San Francisco. In San Francisco, he met Lenny Bruce, about whom he said, &quot;I liked him and wish I had known him better ... but most of what has been written about him is a waste of good ink, and his most zealous adherents and hardest-core devotees are to be avoided, even if it means working your way around the world in the hold of a goat transport.&quot;

In 1965, Cavett did some commercial voiceovers, including a series of mock interviews with Mel Brooks for Ballantine beer. In the next couple of years he appeared on game shows, including &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;. He wrote for Merv Griffin and appeared on Griffin&#x27;s talk show several times, and then on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. In the late 1960s or early 1970s, he narrated a National Association of Broadcasters PSA featuring A Boy Wandering Around a Forest.

After doing &quot;The Star and the Story&quot;, a rejected television pilot with Van Johnson, Cavett hosted a special, &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, for Bud Yorkin and Norman Lear.

In 1968, Cavett was hired by ABC to host &quot;This Morning&quot;. According to a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article, the show was too sophisticated for a morning audience, and ABC first moved the show to prime time, and subsequently to a late-night slot opposite Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

=== &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; ===

Intermittently since 1968, Cavett has been host of his own talk show, in various formats and on various television and radio networks:
* ABC (1968–1974)
* CBS (1975)
* PBS (1977–1982)
* USA Network (1985–1986)
* Olympia Broadcasting (syndicated radio show, 1985–1989)
* ABC (1986–1987)
* CNBC (1989–1996)
* Turner Classic Movies (2006–2007)

Cavett has been nominated for at least 10 Emmy Awards and has won three. In 1970, he co-hosted the Emmy Awards Show (from Carnegie Hall in New York) with Bill Cosby (from Century Plaza in Los Angeles). His most popular talk show was his ABC program, which ran from 1969 to 1974. From 1962 to 1992, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; was arguably the most popular late-night variety and talk show. Unlike many contemporary shows that attempted to compete with Carson in the same timeslot but were quickly cancelled, Cavett managed to remain on the air for five years despite ABC being a smaller network with fewer affiliates than NBC at the time.

Cavett earned a reputation as &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s talk show host&quot; and received favorable reviews from critics. As a talk show host, Cavett has been noted for his ability to listen to his guests and engage them in intellectual conversation. Clive James described Cavett &quot;as a true sophisticate with a daunting intellectual range&quot; and &quot;the most distinguished talk-show host in America.&quot; He is also known for his ability to remain calm and mediate between contentious guests as well as his resonant voice.

His show often focused on controversial people or subjects, often pairing guests with opposing views on social or political issues, such as Jim Brown and Lester Maddox.

On February 11, 1970, Cavett hosted a tribute to the life and works of Sir Noël Coward, who had just been knighted in December 1969. Coward appeared as a guest, along with Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, Tammy Grimes, and Brian Bedford, each of whom were enjoying a successful run on Broadway in the revival of Coward&#x27;s play, &quot;Private Lives&quot;. In reviewing the show for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, television critic Jack Gould said, &quot;The age of youth? Balder dash! The over‐70 set walked off yesterday morning with a television program that combined the engaging qualities of lightly recalled nostalgia, the sophisticated stiletto, and a demonstration of genuine affection that had more substance than adolescent wails on how love will save the world. Sir Noël Coward, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, friends of a lifetime, met on Dick Cavett&#x27;s show on the American Broadcasting Company network. They exchanged quips, pleasantries and thoughts about the theater with the beguiling charm of talented luminaries. Mr. Cavett was clearly overawed, and for once, the ad libs frequently went over his head. It was an enchanting show ... and the badinage was warm and delightful ... a fun night, and to take out of context a line or here or there could not convey the whole. To go to bed with a chuckle provided by gifted and nice people, onstage as off, is review enough.&quot;

One show from June 1971 featured a debate between future senator and presidential candidate John Kerry and fellow veteran John O&#x27;Neill over the Vietnam War. O&#x27;Neill had been approached by the Nixon administration to work through the Vietnam Veterans for a Just Peace to counter Kerry&#x27;s influence on the public. The debate went poorly for the pro-war side, so angering President Nixon that he is heard discussing the incident on the Watergate tapes, saying, &quot;Well, is there any way we can screw him [Cavett]? That&#x27;s what I mean. There must be ways.&quot; H.R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff, answered, &quot;We&#x27;ve been trying to.&quot; Cavett&#x27;s name comes up a total of 26 times on the tapes, as he repeatedly highlighted the wrongdoings of the Nixon administration on his show.

Cavett hosted many pop stars, both in interview and performance, such as David Bowie, Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. Several of his Emmy Award nominations and one Emmy Award were for Outstanding Musical or Variety Series, and in 2005 Shout Factory released a selection of performances and interviews on a three-DVD set, &quot;The Dick Cavett Show: Rock Icons&quot;, showcasing interviews of and performances by rock musicians who appeared on the Dick Cavett show from 1969 to 1974.

Clips from his TV shows (actual or enacted for the occasion) have been used in films, for example &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;Frequency&quot; (2000) and &quot;Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood&quot; (2022) Cavett was surprised at footage from his TV show appearing in &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. He said at the time of the film&#x27;s release, &quot;I&#x27;m happily enjoying a movie, and suddenly I&#x27;m in it.&quot;

=== 1970s ===
Cavett has appeared as himself in various other television shows, such as &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; as well as serving as a host for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1976. He also had a cameo role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977) and he played himself in the movie &quot;Power Play&quot; (1977).

===1980s===
Cavett appeared in &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; (1986), &quot;Cheers&quot; (1983), and in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Health&quot; (1980). In a cameo in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987), as part of a dream sequence, he turned into Freddy Krueger and slashed his guest, Zsa Zsa Gabor, halfway through the interview. In Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988), he played a rare cameo as a character (Delia&#x27;s agent) other than himself. Cavett often appeared on television quiz and game shows, including &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, and the &quot;$25,000 Pyramid&quot;.

Cavett narrated the HBO documentary series &quot;Time Was&quot;. Each episode covered a decade, ranging from the 1920s to the 1970s. The show originally aired in November 1979 and ran for six months. Cavett hosted a documentary series for HBO in the early 1980s titled &quot;Remember When . . .&quot; that examined changes in American culture over time and he hosted HBO&#x27;s monthly review series &quot;HBO Magazine&quot;.

In April 1981, Cavett traveled to Stockholm, Sweden, to interview pop group ABBA on the occasion of their tenth anniversary as a group. The special, titled &quot;Dick Cavett Meets ABBA&quot;, was taped by the Swedish TV network SVT and was broadcast mainly in Europe.

In 1988, Cavett made a special appearance on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; during their week of shows at Radio City Music Hall, walking on stage after someone solved the puzzle &quot;Dick Cavett.&quot; In 1974, Cavett&#x27;s company, Daphne Productions, co-produced with Don Lipp Productions a short-lived ABC game show, &quot;The Money Maze&quot;, although Cavett&#x27;s name did not appear on the credits. He also had a brief stint as the Narrator in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Into the Woods&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
In 1995, Cavett lent his voice for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homie the Clown&quot;. He also appeared in footage from &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in Robert Zemeckis&#x27; &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), and Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995).

===2000s===
From November 2000 to January 2002, he played the narrator in a Broadway revival of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

Cavett is featured in the 2003 documentary &quot;From the Ashes: The Life and Times of Tick Hall&quot; about the fire that destroyed his home in Montauk, New York and his effort to rebuild it.

Cavett&#x27;s signature tune has long been a trumpet version of the vocalise &quot;Glitter and Be Gay&quot; from Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;. The tune was first played at the midpoint of his ABC show, and later became the theme of his PBS show. The tune is also played as he walks on stage during guest appearances on other talk shows.

Cavett was present when actor Marlon Brando broke the jaw of paparazzo photographer Ron Galella on June 12, 1973. Galella had followed Cavett and Brando to a restaurant after the taping of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in New York City.

In 2008, Cavett entered an Iraq war dispute with a &quot;New York Times&quot; blog entry criticizing General David Petraeus, stating &quot;I can&#x27;t look at Petraeus—his uniform ornamented like a Christmas tree with honors, medals, and ribbons—without thinking of the great Mort Sahl at the peak of his brilliance.&quot; Cavett went on to recall Sahl&#x27;s expressed contempt for General William Westmoreland&#x27;s display of medals, and criticized Petraeus for not speaking in plain language.

===2010s===
In 2011, Cavett appeared as a talking head in the Robert Weide two-part documentary series &quot;Woody Allen: A Documentary&quot; for &quot;American Masters&quot; which aired on PBS.

In December 2012, for their annual birthday celebration to &quot;The Master&quot;, The Noël Coward Society invited Cavett as the guest celebrity to lay flowers in front of Coward&#x27;s statue at New York&#x27;s Gershwin Theatre, commemorating the 113th birthday of Sir Noël. Coward had made an appearance on Cavett&#x27;s ABC late-night television show in 1970 after being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in December 1969.

Cavett starred in &quot;Hellman v. McCarthy (Literary Legends Declare War!)&quot; in New York City&#x27;s Abingdon Theatre. Cavett re-enacted his show of January 25, 1980, when literary critic Mary McCarthy appeared as a guest, and declared every word playwright Lillian Hellman wrote was &quot;a lie, including &#x27;and&#x27; and &#x27;the&#x27;.&quot; Hellman later sued McCarthy for libel. The suit spanned more than four years. Cavett&#x27;s off-Broadway play opened March 14, 2014, and closed April 13, 2014, in its limited run. He subsequently came to Los Angeles to appear in a production at Theatre 40, and delighted audiences by remaining onstage after the performance and doing a 10-minute monologue.

=== 2020s ===
In January 2020, Cavett appeared on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; promoting the new HBO special, &quot;Ali and Cavett: The Tales of the Tapes&quot;. There he talked about his career as a comedian and talk show host, as well as his relationship with Muhammad Ali.

== Influence and impact ==
In January 2020, when Cavett appeared as a guest on &quot;Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, Colbert stated that he was a huge admirer of Cavett, and had seen all of his talk shows. Colbert also stated, &quot;People ask me who my influences are, and of course Johnny Carson, and of course David Letterman, but the one people don&#x27;t automatically know is what a huge influence you were on me, the way you interviewed people was so honest, you had such interesting and unusual guests and asked such interesting and deep questions&quot;.

==Writing==
Cavett has co-authored two books with Christopher Porterfield: &quot;Cavett&quot; (1974), his autobiography, and &quot;Eye on Cavett&quot; (1983). Cavett has also written a blog, published by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, entitled &quot;Talk Show: Dick Cavett Speaks Again&quot;.
==Personal life==

===Family===
While taking a class at Yale School of Drama as an undergraduate, Cavett met his future wife, Caroline Nye McGeoy (known professionally as Carrie Nye), a native of Greenwood, Mississippi. After graduation, the two acted in summer theater in Williamstown, Massachusetts; and Cavett worked for two weeks in a local lumberyard to be able to buy an engagement ring. On June 4, 1964, they were married in New York. They remained married until Nye&#x27;s death in 2006. In 2010, Cavett married author Martha Rogers in New Orleans, Louisiana. From this marriage, Cavett has two stepchildren. Rogers and Cavett reside in Ridgefield, Connecticut. They were formerly residents of Montauk, Long Island, and sold their estate there in 2021 for $23.6 million.

===Depression===
Cavett has openly discussed his bouts of clinical depression, an illness that first affected him during his freshman year at Yale. According to an interview published in a 1992 issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine, Cavett contacted Nathan Kline in 1975 seeking treatment. Kline prescribed antidepressant medication, which according to Cavett was successful in treating his depression.

In 1980, Cavett experienced what he characterized as his &quot;biggest depressive episode&quot;. While on board a Concorde before takeoff, Cavett broke out into a sweat and became agitated. After he was removed from the plane, Cavett was taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, where he later underwent electroconvulsive therapy. Regarding this method of treatment, Cavett is quoted as saying, &quot;In my case, ECT was miraculous. My wife was dubious, but when she came into my room afterward, I sat up and said, &#x27;Look who&#x27;s back among the living.&#x27; It was like a magic wand.&quot;

He was also the subject of a 1993 video produced by the Depression and Related Affective Disorders Association called &quot;A Patient&#x27;s Perspective&quot;.

In 1997, Cavett was sued by producer James Moskovitz for breach of contract after failing to show up for a nationally syndicated radio program (also called &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;). Cavett&#x27;s lawyer, Melvyn Leventhal, said at the time that Cavett left because of a manic-depressive episode. The case was later dropped.

==In popular culture==
Cavett was portrayed by Erin Gann in Episode 8 of the first season of &quot;Minx&quot;. He appeared as himself in episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.
Cavett appeared as himself on an episode of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; from season 5, episode 18, entitled &quot;Con Heir&quot;, where he is a guest at a party and talks with Serena.

<text>Polyipnus is a genus of oceanic ray-finned fish in the family Sternoptychidae. This is the largest genus of the marine hatchetfishes subfamily Sternoptychinae and indeed of the entire Sternoptychidae. It is not quite as apomorphic as their relatives; it may be that the genus is actually a paraphyletic assemblage of less advanced Sternoptychinae and would need to be split.

Fossils of this genus show that they have existed at least since the Early Oligocene, about 30 million years ago.

==Species==
There are currently 34 recognized species in this genus:
* &quot;Polyipnus aquavitus&quot; (aquavit hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus asper&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus asteroides&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus bruuni&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus clarus&quot; (slope hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus danae&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus elongatus&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus fraseri&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus indicus&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus inermis&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus kiwiensis&quot; (kiwi hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus laruei&quot; (bigeye hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus laternatus&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus latirastrus&quot; (comb-side hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus limatulus&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus matsubarai&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus meteori&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus notatus&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus nuttingi&quot; (Nutting&#x27;s hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus oluolus&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus omphus&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus ovatus&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus parini&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus paxtoni&quot; (Paxton&#x27;s hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus polli&quot; (round hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus ruggeri&quot; (rugby hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus soelae&quot; (Soela hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus spinifer&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus spinosus&quot; (spiny hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus stereope&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus surugaensis&quot; 
* &quot;Polyipnus tridentifer&quot; (three-spined hatchetfish)
* &quot;Polyipnus triphanos&quot; (three-light hatchetfish)

<text>Sternoptyx is an oceanic ray-finned fish genus which belongs in the family Sternoptychidae. This is the type genus of the Sternoptychidae, as well as the marine hatchetfish subfamily Sternoptychinae.

&quot;Sternoptyx&quot; have silvery, high, and laterally compressed bodies and large, non-telescopic eyes. They are all relatively small, with even the largest species (&quot;S. pseudobscura&quot; and &quot;S. pseudodiaphana&quot;) not exceeding standard length.

==Species==
There are currently four recognized species in this genus:
* &quot;Sternoptyx diaphana&quot; (Diaphanous hatchetfish)
* &quot;Sternoptyx obscura&quot; 
* &quot;Sternoptyx pseudobscura&quot; (Highlight hatchetfish)
* &quot;Sternoptyx pseudodiaphana&quot; (False oblique hatchetfish)

Fossils of this genus show that they have existed at least since the Early Oligocene, about 30 million years ago.

<text>A Jupiter-crosser is a minor planet whose orbit crosses that of Jupiter. Jupiter trojans can be inner grazers (105), outer grazers (52), co-orbitals (183), and crossers (537). Discounting them, there is one numbered, 7 non-numbered, and 19 cometary outer-grazers. For the Jupiter trojans, see List of Jupiter trojans (Greek camp) and List of Jupiter trojans (Trojan camp).

==Members==

===Inner grazers===

The following is a list of named asteroids that are not Jupiter trojans with a&lt;4.950429, 4.950429&lt;Q&lt;5.458104.
===Outer grazers===
Similar to inner grazers, these orbit with a semi-major axis greater than Jupiter, but still have a perihelion distance within Jupiter&#x27;s perihelion and aphelion, a&gt;5.458104 and 4.950429&lt;q&lt;5.458104.
===Jupiter crossers===
These are asteroids that cross the orbit of Jupiter in any sort of way, defined simply as having a perihelion less than that of Jupiter&#x27;s perihelion, and an aphelion greater than Jupiter&#x27;s aphelion.
==Jupiter Crossers==

The numbered Jupiter-crossers are (incomplete):

<text>Otto von Böhtlingk (, &quot;Otton Nikolayevich Byotlingk&quot;; – ) was a Russian-German Indologist and Sanskrit scholar. His &quot;magnum opus&quot; was a Sanskrit-German dictionary.

==Biography==
He was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia. His German ancestors migrated to Russia from Lübeck in 1713. Having studied (1833–1835) Oriental languages, particularly Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, at the University of Saint Petersburg, he continued his studies in Germany, first in Berlin and then (1839–1842) in Bonn.

Returning to Saint Petersburg in 1842, he was attached to the Royal Academy of Sciences, and was elected an ordinary member of that society in 1855. In 1860 he was made Russian state councillor, and later privy councillor with a title of nobility. In 1862, the American Philosophical Society elected him an international Member. In 1868 he settled at Jena, and in 1885 moved to Leipzig, where he resided until his death.

==Scholarship==
Böhtlingk was one of the most distinguished scholars of the nineteenth century, and his works are of pre-eminent value in the field of Indian and comparative philology.

His first great work was a translation of the Sanskrit grammar of Panini, , with a German commentary, under the title &quot;Acht Bücher grammatischer Regeln&quot; (Bonn, 1839–1840). This was in reality a criticism of Franz Bopp&#x27;s philological methods.

This work was followed by:
*&quot;Vopadevas Grammatik&quot; (Saint Petersburg, 1847)
*&quot;Über die Sprache der Jakuten&quot; (Saint Petersburg, 1851) 
*&quot;Indische Sprüche&quot;, a series of Sanskrit apothegms and proverbial verses (2nd ed. in 3 parts, Saint Petersburg, 1870–1873, to which an index was published by Blau, Leipzig, 1893)
*a critical examination and translation of the &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; (Saint Petersburg, 1889)
*a translation of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; (Saint Petersburg, 1889)

His magnum opus was his great Sanskrit-German dictionary, &quot;Sanskrit-Wörterbuch&quot; (7 vols., Saint Petersburg, 1853–1875; shortened ed. (without citations) 7 vols, Saint Petersburg, 1879–1889), which with the assistance of his two friends, Rudolf Roth (d. 1895) and Albrecht Weber (b. 1825), was completed in 23 years.

He also published several smaller treatises, notably one on Vedic accent, &quot;Über den Accent im Sanskrit&quot; (1843). Also notable are his &quot;Sanskrit-Chrestomathie&quot; (Saint Petersburg, 1845; 2d ed., 1877–97), and an edition with translation of a treatise on Hindu poetics by Daṇḍin, &quot;Kāvyādarśa&quot; (Leipzig, 1890). Böhtlingk took up Panini&#x27;s grammar again, 47 years after his first edition, when he republished it with a complete translation under the title &quot;Panini&#x27;s Grammatik mit Übersetzung&quot; (Leipzig, 1887).

Abhik Ghosh and Paul Kiparsky suggested that Dmitri Mendeleev may have known his contemporary&#x27;s Böhtlingk&#x27;s work on the periodic nature of the Sanskrit writing and this helped him in the formulation of the periodic table. According to this suggestion, Mendeleev&#x27;s use of the prefixes &quot;eka&quot;, &quot;dvi&quot;, and &quot;tri&quot; (Sanskrit for one, two, and three) to name as yet undiscovered chemical elements may be viewed as an homage to Sanskrit grammar and to the Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini.

<text>The IBM 1711 Data Converter was part of the IBM 1710 process control computer. The 1711 contained an analog-to-digital converter that accepted signals from the IBM 1712 Multiplexer and Terminal Unit that were between -50 millivolts and +50 millivolts and converted them into signed, four decimal digit numbers that were stored in the 1710s core memory.

The 1711 featured a real-time clock that could place the current hour and minute into storage, again as a 4 digit number. On the 1711&#x27;s control panel, there was a bank of seven decimal digit manual entry switches that could be read by the computer. The 1711 also contained address circuitry for the IBM 1712 Multiplexer.

Optional 1711 features included contact sense, contact operate, analog output, interrupt, and process branch indicators.

While all this and more would fit comfortably on a single IC today, the IBM 1711 occupied a three section rack cabinet.

<text>The Ephraim Union (EU) is a regional political party in the Indian state of Mizoram. EU belongs to the section in Mizoram that claims that the Mizos are descendants of the ten lost tribes of Israel, and advocates conversion to Judaism. EU struggles for making it easier for Mizos to convert to Judaism and migrate to Israel.

EU also claims that the leaders of Mizoram (the erstwhile Mizo Union) had signed a contract stating that Mizoram would be a part of India for only ten years, at the time of Independence in 1947. EU doesn&#x27;t however, present any evidence proving this position.

In the state assembly elections in 2003 EU had put up three candidates (out of 40 in total in the state). Together they mustered 123 votes.

In the Lok Sabha elections in 1999 EU put up a candidate in the only constituency in Mizoram. M The candidate got 1,578 votes (0,54% of votes in Mizoram). In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections the party fared better, and the party candidate Tlangdingliana got 6,512 votes (1,87% of votes in the state).

<text>Maraland Democratic Front was a regional political party in the Indian state of Mizoram. The party was active amongst the Mara people in the southern part of the state. The party had run the Mara Autonomous District Council (one of three autonomous districts in Mizoram) together with Indian National Congress in the previous term.

==Electoral history==
In the 2003 Mizoram Legislative Assembly election, the MDF put up candidates in two constituencies (out of 40 in total in the state). The party president and founder, P. P. Thawla was able to get elected from Tuipang. P.P. Thawla participated in the MNF-led state government, and was minister for Excise and Soil &amp; Water conservation but later resigned because of a decrease in the number of cabinet ministers.

In the 2008 Mizoram Legislative Assembly election, P.P. Thawla won the Palak seat with 4206 votes (33.37%). He was again the only representative of his party in the Mizoram Assembly.

The current president of the party is M. Laikaw, one of the founding members of MDF. The MDF formed a coalition with the MNF in the 2012 elections. However, the coalition lost the MADC elections to Congress, managing to secure 7 seats.

==Merger with BJP==
On 12 July 2017, party Chairman P P Thawlla merged his wing of Maraland Democratic Front (MDF) with the Bharatiya Janata Party at a merger ceremony conducted in presence of BJP Mizoram state president, John V. Hluna.

<text>Congress Jananayaka Peravai (Congress Democratic Front) previously known as (&quot;Tamil Maanila Congress Jananayaka Peravai&quot;) (or) (&quot;T.M.C Jananayaka Peravai&quot;) was a political party in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It was founded in 2001 by former union finance minister P. Chidambaram, as a splinter group of the Tamil Maanila Congress, when the TMC allied itself with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. 2001 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election P. Chidambaram other side Party DMK-BJP (NDA) Joint Meet to Assembly election. 

In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections Chidambaram ran as the Indian National Congress candidate from Sivagangai, and won with 400 393 votes (60,01%).

On 25 November 2004 CJP merged into the Indian National Congress. Discussions about a merger had taken place during a long time, but the merger was resisted by the Tamil Nadu Congress leadership. In the end the merger was pushed through by the national Congress leadership.

<doc id="857564" wikidata="Q2414958" url="?curid=857564" title="Discrete wavelet transform">
<text>In numerical analysis and functional analysis, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is any wavelet transform for which the wavelets are discretely sampled. As with other wavelet transforms, a key advantage it has over Fourier transforms is temporal resolution: it captures both frequency &quot;and&quot; location information (location in time).

== Definition ==

=== One level of the transform ===
The DWT of a signal formula_1 is calculated by passing it through a series of filters. First the samples are passed through a low-pass filter with impulse response formula_2 resulting in a convolution of the two:

:formula_3

The signal is also decomposed simultaneously using a high-pass filter formula_4. The outputs give the detail coefficients (from the high-pass filter) and approximation coefficients (from the low-pass). It is important that the two filters are related to each other and they are known as a quadrature mirror filter.

However, since half the frequencies of the signal have now been removed, half the samples can be discarded according to Nyquist&#x27;s rule. The filter output of the low-pass filter formula_2 in the diagram above is then subsampled by 2 and further processed by passing it again through a new low-pass filter formula_2 and a high- pass filter formula_4 with half the cut-off frequency of the previous one, i.e.:

:formula_8
:formula_9

This decomposition has halved the time resolution since only half of each filter output characterises the signal. However, each output has half the frequency band of the input, so the frequency resolution has been doubled.

With the subsampling operator formula_10

:formula_11

the above summation can be written more concisely.

:formula_12
:formula_13

However computing a complete convolution formula_14 with subsequent downsampling would waste computation time.

The Lifting scheme is an optimization where these two computations are interleaved.

=== Cascading and filter banks ===

This decomposition is repeated to further increase the frequency resolution and the approximation coefficients decomposed with high- and low-pass filters and then down-sampled. This is represented as a binary tree with nodes representing a sub-space with a different time-frequency localisation. The tree is known as a filter bank.

At each level in the above diagram the signal is decomposed into low and high frequencies. Due to the decomposition process the input signal must be a multiple of formula_15 where formula_16 is the number of levels.

For example a signal with 32 samples, frequency range 0 to formula_17 and 3 levels of decomposition, 4 output scales are produced:

=== Relationship to the mother wavelet ===

The filterbank implementation of wavelets can be interpreted as computing the wavelet coefficients of a discrete set of child wavelets for a given mother wavelet formula_18. In the case of the discrete wavelet transform, the mother wavelet is shifted and scaled by powers of two

formula_19

where formula_20 is the scale parameter and formula_21 is the shift parameter, both of which are integers.

Recall that the wavelet coefficient formula_22 of a signal formula_23 is the projection of formula_23 onto a wavelet, and let formula_23 be a signal of length formula_26. In the case of a child wavelet in the discrete family above,

formula_27

Now fix formula_20 at a particular scale, so that formula_29 is a function of formula_21 only. In light of the above equation, formula_31 can be viewed as a convolution of formula_23 with a dilated, reflected, and normalized version of the mother wavelet, formula_33, sampled at the points formula_34. But this is precisely what the detail coefficients give at level formula_20 of the discrete wavelet transform. Therefore, for an appropriate choice of formula_36 and formula_37, the detail coefficients of the filter bank correspond exactly to a wavelet coefficient of a discrete set of child wavelets for a given mother wavelet formula_18.

As an example, consider the discrete Haar wavelet, whose mother wavelet is formula_39. Then the dilated, reflected, and normalized version of this wavelet is formula_40, which is, indeed, the highpass decomposition filter for the discrete Haar wavelet transform.

=== Time complexity ===

The filterbank implementation of the Discrete Wavelet Transform takes only O(&quot;N&quot;) in certain cases, as compared to O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) for the fast Fourier transform.

Note that if formula_37 and formula_36 are both a constant length (i.e. their length is independent of N), then formula_43 and formula_44 each take O(&quot;N&quot;) time. The wavelet filterbank does each of these two O(&quot;N&quot;) convolutions, then splits the signal into two branches of size N/2. But it only recursively splits the upper branch convolved with formula_37 (as contrasted with the FFT, which recursively splits both the upper branch and the lower branch). This leads to the following recurrence relation

: formula_46

which leads to an O(&quot;N&quot;) time for the entire operation, as can be shown by a geometric series expansion of the above relation.

As an example, the discrete Haar wavelet transform is linear, since in that case formula_36 and formula_37 are constant length 2.

: formula_49

The locality of wavelets, coupled with the O(&quot;N&quot;) complexity, guarantees that the transform can be computed online (on a streaming basis). This property is in sharp contrast to FFT, which requires access to the entire signal at once. It also applies to the multi-scale transform and also to the multi-dimensional transforms (e.g., 2-D DWT).

== Examples ==

=== Haar wavelets ===

The first DWT was invented by Hungarian mathematician Alfréd Haar. For an input represented by a list of formula_15 numbers, the Haar wavelet transform may be considered to pair up input values, storing the difference and passing the sum. This process is repeated recursively, pairing up the sums to prove the next scale, which leads to formula_51 differences and a final sum.

=== Daubechies wavelets ===

The most commonly used set of discrete wavelet transforms was formulated by the Belgian mathematician Ingrid Daubechies in 1988. This formulation is based on the use of recurrence relations to generate progressively finer discrete samplings of an implicit mother wavelet function; each resolution is twice that of the previous scale. In her seminal paper, Daubechies derives a family of wavelets, the first of which is the Haar wavelet. Interest in this field has exploded since then, and many variations of Daubechies&#x27; original wavelets were developed.

=== The dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DCWT) ===

The dual-tree complex wavelet transform (formula_52WT) is a relatively recent enhancement to the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), with important additional properties: It is nearly shift invariant and directionally selective in two and higher dimensions. It achieves this with a redundancy factor of only formula_53, substantially lower than the undecimated DWT. The multidimensional (M-D) dual-tree formula_52WT is nonseparable but is based on a computationally efficient, separable filter bank (FB).

=== Others ===
Other forms of discrete wavelet transform include the Le Gall–Tabatabai (LGT) 5/3 wavelet developed by Didier Le Gall and Ali J. Tabatabai in 1988 (used in JPEG 2000 or JPEG XS ), the Binomial QMF developed by Ali Naci Akansu in 1990, the set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm developed by Amir Said with William A. Pearlman in 1996, the non- or undecimated wavelet transform (where downsampling is omitted), and the Newland transform (where an orthonormal basis of wavelets is formed from appropriately constructed top-hat filters in frequency space). Wavelet packet transforms are also related to the discrete wavelet transform. Complex wavelet transform is another form.

=== Coding ===
Complete Java code for a 1-D and 2-D DWT using Haar, Daubechies, Coiflet, and Legendre wavelets is available from the open source project: JWave.
Furthermore, a fast lifting implementation of the discrete biorthogonal CDF 9/7 wavelet transform in C, used in the JPEG 2000 image compression standard can be found here (archived 5 March 2012).

An example of the Haar wavelet in Java is given below:

public static int[] discreteHaarWaveletTransform(int[] input) {
 // This function assumes that input.length=2^n, n&gt;1
 int[] output = new int[input.length];

 for (int length = input.length / 2; ; length = length / 2) {
 // length is the current length of the working area of the output array.
 // length starts at half of the array size and every iteration is halved until it is 1.
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
 int sum = input[i * 2] + input[i * 2 + 1];
 int difference = input[i * 2] - input[i * 2 + 1];
 output[i] = sum;
 output[length + i] = difference;
 if (length == 1) {
 return output;

 //Swap arrays to do next iteration
 System.arraycopy(output, 0, input, 0, length);
}


The figure on the right shows an example of applying the above code to compute the Haar wavelet coefficients on a sound waveform. This example highlights two key properties of the wavelet transform:

*Natural signals often have some degree of smoothness, which makes them sparse in the wavelet domain. There are far fewer significant components in the wavelet domain in this example than there are in the time domain, and most of the significant components are towards the coarser coefficients on the left. Hence, natural signals are compressible in the wavelet domain.
*The wavelet transform is a multiresolution, bandpass representation of a signal. This can be seen directly from the filterbank definition of the discrete wavelet transform given in this article. For a signal of length formula_26, the coefficients in the range formula_56 represent a version of the original signal which is in the pass-band formula_57. This is why zooming in on these ranges of the wavelet coefficients looks so similar in structure to the original signal. Ranges which are closer to the left (larger formula_20 in the above notation), are coarser representations of the signal, while ranges to the right represent finer details.

== Properties ==
The Haar DWT illustrates the desirable properties of wavelets in general. First, it can be performed in formula_59 operations; second, it captures not only a notion of the frequency content of the input, by examining it at different scales, but also temporal content, i.e. the times at which these frequencies occur. Combined, these two properties make the Fast wavelet transform (FWT) an alternative to the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT).

=== Time issues ===
Due to the rate-change operators in the filter bank, the discrete WT is not time-invariant but actually very sensitive to the alignment of the signal in time. To address the time-varying problem of wavelet transforms, Mallat and Zhong proposed a new algorithm for wavelet representation of a signal, which is invariant to time shifts. According to this algorithm, which is called a TI-DWT, only the scale parameter is sampled along the dyadic sequence 2^j (j∈Z) and the wavelet transform is calculated for each point in time.

== Applications ==
The discrete wavelet transform has a huge number of applications in science, engineering, mathematics and computer science. Most notably, it is used for signal coding, to represent a discrete signal in a more redundant form, often as a preconditioning for data compression. Practical applications can also be found in signal processing of accelerations for gait analysis, image processing, in digital communications and many others.
It is shown that discrete wavelet transform (discrete in scale and shift, and continuous in time) is successfully implemented as analog filter bank in biomedical signal processing for design of low-power pacemakers and also in ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communications.

=== Image processing ===
Wavelets are often used to denoise two dimensional signals, such as images. The following example provides three steps to remove unwanted white Gaussian noise from the noisy image shown. Matlab was used to import and filter the image.

The first step is to choose a wavelet type, and a level N of decomposition. In this case biorthogonal 3.5 wavelets were chosen with a level N of 10. Biorthogonal wavelets are commonly used in image processing to detect and filter white Gaussian noise, due to their high contrast of neighboring pixel intensity values. Using these wavelets a wavelet transformation is performed on the two dimensional image.

Following the decomposition of the image file, the next step is to determine threshold values for each level from 1 to N. Birgé-Massart strategy is a fairly common method for selecting these thresholds. Using this process individual thresholds are made for N = 10 levels. Applying these thresholds are the majority of the actual filtering of the signal.

The final step is to reconstruct the image from the modified levels. This is accomplished using an inverse wavelet transform. The resulting image, with white Gaussian noise removed is shown below the original image. When filtering any form of data it is important to quantify the signal-to-noise-ratio of the result. In this case, the SNR of the noisy image in comparison to the original was 30.4958%, and the SNR of the denoised image is 32.5525%. The resulting improvement of the wavelet filtering is a SNR gain of 2.0567%.

Choosing other wavelets, levels, and thresholding strategies can result in different types of filtering. In this example, white Gaussian noise was chosen to be removed. Although, with different thresholding, it could just as easily have been amplified.

To illustrate the differences and similarities between the discrete wavelet transform with the discrete Fourier transform, consider the DWT and DFT of the following sequence: (1,0,0,0), a unit impulse.

The DFT has orthogonal basis (DFT matrix):

: formula_60

while the DWT with Haar wavelets for length 4 data has orthogonal basis in the rows of:

: formula_61

(To simplify notation, whole numbers are used, so the bases are orthogonal but not orthonormal.)

Preliminary observations include:
* Sinusoidal waves differ only in their frequency. The first does not complete any cycles, the second completes one full cycle, the third completes two cycles, and the fourth completes three cycles (which is equivalent to completing one cycle in the opposite direction). Differences in phase can be represented by multiplying a given basis vector by a complex constant.
* Wavelets, by contrast, have both frequency and location. As before, the first completes zero cycles, and the second completes one cycle. However, the third and fourth both have the same frequency, twice that of the first. Rather than differing in frequency, they differ in &quot;location&quot; — the third is nonzero over the first two elements, and the fourth is nonzero over the second two elements.

:formula_62

The DWT demonstrates the localization: the (1,1,1,1) term gives the average signal value, the (1,1,–1,–1) places the signal in the left side of the domain, and the 
(1,–1,0,0) places it at the left side of the left side, and truncating at any stage yields a downsampled version of the signal:
:formula_63

The DFT, by contrast, expresses the sequence by the interference of waves of various frequencies – thus truncating the series yields a low-pass filtered version of the series:
:formula_64
Notably, the middle approximation (2-term) differs. From the frequency domain perspective, this is a better approximation, but from the time domain perspective it has drawbacks – it exhibits undershoot – one of the values is negative, though the original series is non-negative everywhere – and ringing, where the right side is non-zero, unlike in the wavelet transform. On the other hand, the Fourier approximation correctly shows a peak, and all points are within formula_65 of their correct value, though all points have error. The wavelet approximation, by contrast, places a peak on the left half, but has no peak at the first point, and while it is exactly correct for half the values (reflecting location), it has an error of formula_66 for the other values.

This illustrates the kinds of trade-offs between these transforms, and how in some respects the DWT provides preferable behavior, particularly for the modeling of transients.

=== Watermarking ===
Watermarking using DCT-DWT alters the wavelet coefficients of middle-frequency coefficient sets of 5-levels DWT transformed host image, followed by applying the DCT transforms on the selected coefficient sets. Prasanalakshmi B proposed a method that uses the HL frequency sub-band in the middle-frequency coefficient sets LHx and HLx in a 5-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) transformed image.This algorithm chooses a coarser level of DWT in terms of imperceptibility and robustness to apply 4×4 block-based DCT on them. Consequently, higher imperceptibility and robustness can be achieved. Also, the pre-filtering operation is used before extraction of the watermark, sharpening, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filtering, which increases the difference between the information of the watermark and the hosted image. 

The basic idea of the DWT for a two-dimensional image is described as follows: An image is first decomposed into four parts of high, middle, and low-frequency subcomponents (i.e., LL1, HL1, LH1, HH1) by critically subsampling horizontal and vertical channels using subcomponent filters.

The subcomponents HL1, LH1, and HH1 represent the finest scale wavelet coefficients. The subcomponent LL1 is decomposed and critically subsampled to obtain the following coarser-scaled wavelet components. This process is repeated several times, which is determined by the application at hand. 

High-frequency components are considered to embed the watermark since they contain edge information, and the human eye is less sensitive to edge changes. In watermarking algorithms, besides the watermark&#x27;s invisibility, the primary concern is choosing the frequency components to embed the watermark to survive the possible attacks that the transmitted image may undergo. Transform domain techniques have the advantage of unique properties of alternate domains to address spatial domain limitations and have additional features.

The Host image is made to undergo 5-level DWT watermarking. Embedding the watermark in the middle-level frequency sub-bands LLx gives a high degree of imperceptibility and robustness. Consequently, LLx coefficient sets in level five are chosen to increase the robustness of the watermark against common watermarking attacks, especially adding noise and blurring attacks, at little to no additional impact on image quality. Then, the block base DCT is performed on these selected DWT coefficient sets and embeds pseudorandom sequences in middle frequencies. The watermark embedding procedure is explained below:

1. Read the cover image I, of size N×N.

2.The four non-overlapping multi-resolution coefficient sets LL1, HL1, LH1, and HH1 are obtained initially.

3. Decomposition is performed till 5-levels and the frequency subcomponents {HH1, HL1, LH1,}}}} are obtained by computing the fifth level DWT of the image I.

4. Divide the final four coefficient sets: HH5, HL5, LH5 and LL5 into 4 x 4 blocks.

5. DCT is performed on each block in the chosen coefficient sets. These coefficient sets are chosen to inquire about the imperceptibility and robustness of algorithms equally.

6. Scramble the fingerprint image to gain the scrambled watermark WS (i, j).

7. Re-formulate the scrambled watermark image into a vector of zeros and ones.

8. Two uncorrelated pseudorandom sequences are generated from the key obtained from the palm vein. The number of elements in the two pseudorandom sequences must equal the number of mid-band elements of the DCT-transformed DWT coefficient sets.

9. Embed the two pseudorandom sequences with a gain factor α in the DCT-transformed 4x4 blocks of the selected DWT coefficient sets of the host image. Instead of embedding in all coefficients of the DCT block, it is applied only to the mid-band DCT coefficients. If X is denoted as the matrix of the mid-band coefficients of the DCT transformed block, then embedding is done with watermark bit 0, and X&#x27; is updated as X+∝*PN0,watermarkbit=0 and done with watermark bit 1 and X&#x27; is updated as X+∝*PN1. Inverse DCT (IDCT) is done on each block after its mid-band coefficients have been modified to embed the watermark bits.

10. To produce the watermarked host image, Perform the inverse DWT (IDWT) on the DWT-transformed image, including the modified coefficient sets.

== Similar transforms ==
* The Adam7 algorithm, used for interlacing in the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, is a multiscale model of the data which is similar to a DWT with Haar wavelets. Unlike the DWT, it has a specific scale – it starts from an 8×8 block, and it downsamples the image, rather than decimating (low-pass filtering, then downsampling). It thus offers worse frequency behavior, showing artifacts (pixelation) at the early stages, in return for simpler implementation.
* The multiplicative (or geometric) discrete wavelet transform is a variant that applies to an observation model formula_67 involving interactions of a positive regular function formula_68 and a multiplicative independent positive noise formula_69, with formula_70. Denote formula_71, a wavelet transform. Since formula_72, then the standard (additive) discrete wavelet transform formula_73 is such that formula_74 where &quot;detail coefficients&quot; formula_75 cannot be considered as sparse in general, due to the contribution of formula_68 in the latter expression. In the multiplicative framework, the wavelet transform is such that formula_77 This &#x27;embedding&#x27; of wavelets in a multiplicative algebra involves generalized multiplicative approximations and detail operators: For instance, in the case of the Haar wavelets, then up to the normalization coefficient formula_78, the standard formula_73 approximations (arithmetic mean) formula_80 and details (arithmetic differences) formula_81 become respectively geometric mean approximations formula_82 and geometric differences (details) formula_83 when using formula_84.

<text>Argyripnus is an oceanic ray-finned fish genus in the marine hatchetfish family Sternoptychidae. They are commonly known as bristle-mouth fishes, but that may also refer to the related bristlemouth family (Gonostomatidae). &quot;A. iridescens&quot; is called &quot;pearlside&quot;, which usually refers to the closely related genus &quot;Maurolicus&quot;.

==Species==
There are currently seven recognized species in this genus:
* &quot;Argyripnus atlanticus&quot; 
* &quot;Argyripnus brocki&quot; (Brock&#x27;s Bristle-mouth Fish)
* &quot;Argyripnus electronus&quot; 
* &quot;Argyripnus ephippiatus&quot; (Gilbert &amp; Cramer&#x27;s Bristle-mouth Fish)
* &quot;Argyripnus hulleyi&quot; (Reunion bristle-mouth fish)
* &quot;Argyripnus iridescens&quot; (Brilliant Pearlside)
* &quot;Argyripnus pharos&quot; 

Fossils of bristle-mouth fishes show that the genus was already distinct in the Late Oligocene, more than 23 million years ago.

<text>The Ariès was a French automobile manufactured by La Société des Automobile Ariès in Asnières-sur-Seine. The firm was founded in 1902 by Baron . The decision to end production was taken in 1937. Around 20,000 vehicles were produced in total.

The first cars were two- and four-cylinder vehicles built 20 chassis at a time in a large factory. These shaft-drive cars had a rather unusual double rear axle, while the engines were built by Aster.

In 1907 the company made its own narrow-angle V4 engine. The engine had a single cast iron monobloc on a light alloy crankcase. This contained four cylinders in a square layout with a narrow 15° vee angle. Bore and stroke were 60 by 100mm, giving a capacity of 1.13 litres. It was rated at 8/10 fiscal horsepower. The crankshaft was short with disc webs, two main bearings and fork-and-blade connecting rods. Crankpins and main journals were held in the webs by tapers and a shallow nut, giving the effect of an undercut crankshaft. This made the engine extremely compact overall, long, wide and tall. The intention was to offer this compact engine as a replacement that would fit into a wide range of other vehicles. The crankshaft was drilled for a pressure oil feed to the crankpins, an advanced feature for this time, but the pistons and gudgeon pins were still lubricated by splash.

In 1910 Ariès introduced a V6 engine on the same pattern for the 10/14 hp S6.
Ariès entered the field of commercial vehicle production in 1910, mainly for the purpose of supplying the French army; the works built mainly military trucks during World War I, as well as Hispano-Suiza aero engines.

After the war the company presented three new models; one was a four-cylinder, a 7 cv OHC 1085 cc, while the other two were variations on a 15cv 3-litre. One had a sidevalve Aster unit, while the second featured a sporty OHC engine; some of these last were quite successful in racing events.

Ariès had some motor-racing success in the 1920s, particularly with associated, although without success, at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and with more success in other touring car events. Their most successful drivers wore Robert Laly and Jean Chassagne, driving the 3 litre cars.

Ariès stopped production of its 1100 cc and 3-liter cars, which had become obsolete, during the financial crisis of the 1930s. They were replaced in the catalogue with new 1500 cc and 2-liter models with an odd arrangement of a three-speed gearbox augmented by two-speed gears in the back axle, for a total of six speeds forward. Named the Super 10-50, few were made.

After the war, Ariès attempted a comeback, briefly producing moped engines under the name ABG.

<text>The Winnipeg Labour Party was a reformist organization in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, representing labour interests. Founded in 1896, it was based on an earlier Winnipeg organization known as the Independent Labour Party (which was influenced by the British party of the same name, but was not formally connected to any other group).

The party initially received support from both socialists and conservative trade unionists, and succeeded in electing Arthur Puttee to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1900 federal election. The WLP was hostile to radical militancy in the labour movement, however, and lost the support of many socialists in the years which followed.

The WLP nominated two candidates for the provincial election of 1903: William Scott in Winnipeg Centre and Robert Thoms in Winnipeg North. Both finished well behind their Conservative and Liberal opponents.

Puttee was defeated in the 1904 election, but he continued to promote labour causes in his newspaper, &quot;The Voice&quot;. In 1906, his organization was absorbed into another group calling itself the Independent Labour Party.

<text>The Columbia Basin Project (or CBP) in Central Washington, United States, is the irrigation network that the Grand Coulee Dam makes possible. It is the largest water reclamation project in the United States, supplying irrigation water to over of the large project area, all of which was originally intended to be supplied and is still classified irrigable and open for the possible enlargement of the system. Water pumped from the Columbia River is carried over of main canals, stored in a number of reservoirs, then fed into of lateral irrigation canals, and out into of drains and wasteways. The Grand Coulee Dam, powerplant, and various other parts of the CBP are operated by the Bureau of Reclamation. There are three irrigation districts (the Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District, the East Columbia Basin Irrigation District, and the South Columbia Basin Irrigation District) in the project area, which operate additional local facilities.

==History==

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation was created in 1902 to aid development of dry western states. Central Washington&#x27;s Columbia Plateau was a prime candidate—a desert with fertile loess soil and the Columbia River passing through.

Competing groups lobbied for different irrigation projects; a Spokane group wanted a gravity flow canal from Lake Pend Oreille while a Wenatchee group (further south) wanted a large dam on the Columbia River, which would pump water up to fill the nearby Grand Coulee, a formerly-dry canyon-like coulee.

After thirteen years of debate, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the dam project with National Industrial Recovery Act money. (It was later specifically authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1935, and then reauthorized by the Columbia Basin Project Act of 1943 which put it under the Reclamation Project Act of 1939.) Construction of Grand Coulee Dam began in 1933 and was completed in 1942. Its main purpose of pumping water for irrigation was postponed during World War II in favor of electrical power generation that was used for the war effort. Additional hydroelectric generating capacity was added into the 1970s. The Columbia River reservoir behind the dam was named Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake in honor of the president. The irrigation holding reservoir in Grand Coulee was named Banks Lake.

After World War II the project suffered a number of setbacks. Irrigation water began to arrive between 1948 and 1952, but the costs escalated, resulting in the original plan, in which the people receiving irrigation water would pay back the costs of the project over time, being repeatedly revised and becoming a permanent water subsidy. In addition, the original vision of a social engineering project intended to help farmers settle on small landholdings failed. Farm plots, at first restricted in size, became larger and soon became corporate agribusiness operations.

The original plan was that a federal agency similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority would manage the entire system. Instead, conflicts between the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Agriculture thwarted the goal of both agencies of settling the project area with small family farms; larger corporate farms arose instead.

The determination to finish the project&#x27;s plan to irrigate the full waned during the 1960s. The estimated total cost for completing the project had more than doubled between 1940 and 1964, it had become clear that the government&#x27;s financial investment would not be recovered, and that the benefits of the project were unevenly distributed and increasingly going to larger businesses and corporations. These issues and others dampened enthusiasm for the project, although the exact motives behind the decision to stop construction with the project about half finished are not known.

==Geology==

The Columbia Basin in Central Washington is fertile due to its loess soils, but large portions are a near desert, receiving less than ten inches (254 mm) of rain per year. The area is characterized by huge deposits of flood basalt, thousands of feet thick in places, laid down over a period of approximately 11 million years, during the Miocene epoch. These flood basalts are exposed in some places, while in others they are covered with thick layers of loess.

During the last ice age glaciers shaped the landscape of the Columbia River Plateau. Ice blocked the Columbia River near the north end of Grand Coulee, creating glacial lakes Columbia and Spokane. Ice age glaciers also created Glacial Lake Missoula, in what is now Montana. Erosion allowed glacial Lake Columbia to begin to drain into what became Grand Coulee, which was fully created when glacial Lake Missoula along with glacial Lake Columbia catastrophically emptied. This flood event was one of several known as the Missoula Floods. Unique erosion features, called channeled scablands, are attributed to these amazing floods.

==Component units of the project==
===Grand Coulee Dam Complex and Lake Roosevelt===
*Grand Coulee Dam (1950)
**Right (north) Powerhouse
**Left (south) Powerhouse
**Third Powerhouse (1974) was added as a north wing of the dam from the original Right powerhouse. This addition expanded power generation by 300%.
* Lake Roosevelt
* Grand Coulee Pumping-Generating Plant (1953) consist of twelve pump units with combined power of 593kw(795khp), of which six are reversible pump-generator turbine units with a combined generating capacity of 314Mw.) The pumps are used to move water from Lake Roosevelt into Banks Lake, from which it can be either sent south into the Columbia Basin Irrigation system or returned to Lake Roosevelt by the reversible generating pump-turbines to create additional electricity for the grid.

===Feeder Canal, North and Dry Falls Dams, Banks Lake===
*Banks Lake (1951) is an artificial impoundment in the Upper Grand Coulee. It is long and wide. The coulee has nearly vertical rock walls up to high. 
**North Dam, near the town of Grand Coulee, has a maximum height of and a crest length of . 
**Dry Falls, or South Dam, near Coulee City, has a maximum height of and a crest length of . The crest elevation of both dams is . Project water enters Banks Lake through the Feeder Canal from the Pump-generating plant. The outlet for Banks Lake is the Main Canal near Coulee City. It is near the east abutment of Dry Falls Dam. Banks Lake serves as an equalizing reservoir for storage of water for irrigation and can be used to for power generation.
*Feeder Canal (1951) links North Dam at northern end of Banks Lake with the siphon outlets for the Grand Coulee Pumping—Generating plants discharge lines. It is long running in an open concrete-lined canal, and a twin-barrel concrete cut—and-cover conduit.
*Main Canal (1951) is , including of lake sections.
*Bacon Tunnel and Siphon (1950) is a long sealed Siphon under the eastern extension of the Dry Falls draw.
*Billy Clapp Lake (Pinto Dam – zoned earth &amp; rockfill) (1951) aka (Long Lake Dam) is at the south end of Long Lake Coulee. The reservoir is long and wide.
*Potholes Reservoir

==Irrigation==
When it was built, Grand Coulee Dam was the largest dam in the world, but it was only part of the irrigation project. Additional dams were built at the north and south ends of Grand Coulee, the dry canyon south of Grand Coulee Dam, allowing the coulee to be filled with water pumped up from the Columbia River. The resulting reservoir, called Banks Lake, is about long. Banks Lake serves as the CBP&#x27;s initial storage reservoir. Additional canals, siphons, and reservoirs were built south of Bank Lake, reaching over . Water is lifted from Lake Roosevelt to feed the massive network.

The total amount of the Columbia flow that is diverted into the CBP at Grand Coulee varies a little from year to year, and is currently about 3.0 million acre-feet. This is about 3.8 percent of the Columbia&#x27;s average flow as measured at the Grand Coulee dam. This amount is larger than the combined annual flows of the nearby Yakima, Wenatchee, and Okanogan rivers. There were plans to double the area of irrigated land, according to tour guides at the dam, over the next several decades. However, the Bureau of Reclamation website states that no further development is anticipated, with irrigated out of the original planned.

Interest in completing the Columbia Basin Project&#x27;s has grown in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. One reason for the renewed interest is the substantial depletion of the Odessa aquifer. Agricultural operations within the CBP&#x27;s boundaries but outside the developed portion have for decades used groundwater pumped from the Odessa aquifer to irrigate crops.

== Hydroelectric power ==
Hydroelectricity was not the primary goal of the project, but during World War II the demand for electricity in the region boomed. The Hanford nuclear reservation was built just south of the project and aluminum smelting plants flocked to the Columbia Basin. A new power house was built at the Grand Coulee Dam, starting in the late sixties, that tripled the generating capacity. Part of the dam had to be blown up and re-built to make way for the new generators. Electricity is now transmitted to Canada and as far south as San Diego.

==Environmental impact==
One environmental impact has been the reduction in native fish stocks above the dams. The majority of fish in the Columbia basin are migratory fish like salmon, sturgeon and steelhead. These migratory fish are often harmed or unable to pass through the narrow passages and turbines at dams. In addition to the physical barriers the dams pose, the slowing speed and altered course of the river raises temperatures, alters oxygen content, and changes river bed conditions. These altered conditions can stress and potentially kill both migratory and local non-migratory organisms in the river. The decimation of these migratory fish stocks above Grand Coulee Dam would not allow the former fishing lifestyle of Native Americans of the area, who once depended on the salmon for a way of life.

The environmental impacts of the Columbia Basin Project have made it a contentious and often politicized issue. A common argument for not implementing environmental safeguards at dam sites is that post-construction modifications would likely have to be significant. Tour guides at the Grand Coulee dam site, for example, indicate that a &quot;fish ladder might have to be long to get the fish up the needed, and many fish would die before reaching the upper end&quot; thus no fish ladders were built. Advocates of remedial measures point out that such steps would still be better than the status quo, which has led to marked die-offs and the likely extinction of several types of salmon.

There are a number of issues regarding the runoff of irrigation water. The project region receives about 6 to of annual rainfall, while the application of irrigation water amounts to an equivalent 40 to . The original plans did not sufficiently address the inevitable seepage and runoff. In some cases the results are beneficial. For example, numerous new lakes provide recreation opportunities and habitat for fish and game. In other cases agricultural chemicals in the runoff cause pollution.

==Economic benefits and costs==
The irrigation water provided by this project greatly benefits the agricultural production of the area. North Central Washington is one of the largest and most productive tree fruit producing areas on the planet. Without Coulee Dam and the greater Columbia Basin Project, much of North Central Washington State would be too arid for cultivation.

According to the federal Bureau of Reclamation the yearly value of the Columbia Basin Project is $630 million in irrigated crops, $950 million in power production, $20 million in flood damage prevention, and $50 million in recreation. The project itself involves costs that are difficult to determine. The farms that receive irrigation water must pay for it, but due to insufficient data from the Bureau of Reclamation, it is not possible to compare the total cost paid by the Bureau to the payments received. Nevertheless, the farm payments account for only a small fraction of the total cost to the government, resulting in the project&#x27;s agricultural corporations receiving a large water subsidy from the government. Critics describe the CBP as a classical example of federal money being used to subsidize a relatively small group of farmers in the American West in places where it would never be economically viable under other circumstances.

<text>The Arista was a French automobile with a fiberglass body, produced in Paris from 1952 to 1967.

==Background==
The firm had been founded in the late 1940s by Antonio Monge and Robert Rowe under the name Callista, but the two fell out over the future direction of the firm after its original project, a sporting model called the &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot; first seen in prototype form at the 1950 Paris Motor Show, appeared likely to be severely undercut on price when Panhard themselves launched their Panhard Dyna Junior with a comparable level of performance at a far lower price than Callista could achieve with their elegant low volume cars. Monge resolved to return to his former occupation, preparing cars for motor sport events. Shortly after this setback Rowe, who had previously worked as an electrical engineer with the Fulmen business, but who also engaged in other trading activities, suddenly found himself financially ruined after he imported to France several hundred Romanian tractors that turned out to be defective. At the end of 1952 both the firms founding partners, for their own different reasons, withdrew from the project.

==A new name and a new strategy==
The enterprise was rescued by Raymond Gaillard, also known in the automotive world as a regular competitor in the Le Mans 24 Hour race. Up to this point Gaillard had figured in the Callista business only as a substantial investor and potential sales distributor for the &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot; model. Gaillard rescued the residual elements of the business and refounded it under the new name of Arista. From now on the firm concentrated on a smaller lighter and presumably cheaper model called the &quot;Arista Ranelagh&quot;. The Ranelagh names came from the (then as now) fashionable Paris street, Rue du Ranelagh where Gaillard owned a Panhard dealership.

Again based on the mechanical components from the Panhard Dyna X, the car was a low cabriolet with long overhangs at each end, reflected in the difference between the 2130 mm wheelbase and the 4100 mm overall length of the cabriolet model. There was a shorter roadster of only 3620 mm in length. The car weighed only 550/640 kg and a top speed of between 135 and 140 km/h (between 84 and 87 mph) was claimed. Both the light weight and the front-wheel-drive layout were determined by the car&#x27;s Panhard underpinnings.

About 100 were made.

1956 saw the arrival of the Arista Passy, powered by the 42 CV 848 cc engine from the Panhard Dyna Z, and still listed in 1962. A model with the 50 CV &quot;Tigre&quot; engine was sold as the Arista Sport, although the weight savings over a regular PL17 was only about due to the car&#x27;s ample equipment. The little Arista coupé, though stylish, had by now become extremely expensive for a car of this engine size and performance. Sales seem to have slowed to a trickle.

Other Arista designs appeared from time to time, but it is not clear if any others made it to production. Arista had disappeared from view by 1963, although the same business was later involved in making the Sovam sports car.

<doc id="857603" wikidata="Q2737095" url="?curid=857603" title="Hard Core (Lil' Kim album)">
<text>Hard Core is the debut studio album by American rapper Lil&#x27; Kim, released on November 12, 1996, by Undeas Recordings, Big Beat Records, and Atlantic Records. After achieving success with the hip hop group Junior M.A.F.I.A. and their album &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (1995), Kim began working on her solo album with the Notorious B.I.G. serving as the executive producer (besides this, he performed on four songs). She collaborated with a number of producers, such as Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs, Stevie J., David &quot;Ski&quot; Willis and Jermaine Dupri, among others. Other rappers, including Jay-Z, Lil&#x27; Cease and Puff Daddy were featured on the album.

The album was notable for its overt raunchy sexual tone and Kim&#x27;s lyrical delivery, which was praised by music critics and is considered a classic album. &quot;Hard Core&quot; debuted at number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B Albums, selling 78,000 copies in its first week, while reaching number 26 of the Canadian Albums Chart. The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Background==
After making her debut recording appearance on Junior M.A.F.I.A.&#x27;s &quot;Conspiracy&quot; album, Lil&#x27; Kim appeared on records by artists such as Mona Lisa, the Isley Brothers, and Total. With recording her debut album, &quot;Hard Core&quot; was mainly recorded at The Hit Factory in Manhattan, New York City. Working with a number of producers, including Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs and Jermaine Dupri, the album featured edgy hardcore rap and explicit sexuality, as the title suggested, which at the time were two territories that had long been the province of male rappers. The album was originally titled &quot;Queen Bee&quot;.

Guest artists included Jay-Z, the Notorious B.I.G., and other members of Junior M.A.F.I.A. The promotional campaign for the album, including the album cover, featured provocative advertisements of Kim dressed in a skimpy bikini and surrounded by furs.

During the recording sessions, Kim and B.I.G made a demo for the track &quot;Street Dreams&quot;, never released officially. &quot;Big Momma Thang&quot; was originally intended to be a diss towards Faith Evans and 2Pac but was re-recorded after Biggie disapproved of it. The verse containing remarks against Faith was replaced by Jay-Z&#x27;s vocals while the third verse, which had a diss on 2Pac, was re-recorded by Kim.

==Singles==
The first singles from &quot;Hard Core&quot;, the gold-certified &quot;No Time&quot; peaked in the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, top 10 of the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart, and topped the Rap Songs chart, making Lil&#x27; Kim the first female rap artist to have two consecutive number-one singles on that chart. Both singles peaked in the top 50 of the UK Singles Chart. A third single, &quot;Not Tonight&quot; (Remix), became a huge top 10 success in 1997, peaking at number six on the Hot 100, number three on the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart, and topping the Rap Songs chart. The single also reached the top 20 on the UK chart and number 10 in Germany. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA. It was nominated in 1998 for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. “Big Momma Thang” was released to commercial radio in the fall of 1996.

==Critical reception and legacy==
&quot;Hard Core&quot; received critical acclaim. &quot;The Source&quot; called the album &quot;a solid debut because phat beats and rhymes are really all it takes, and they&#x27;re both present&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine included &quot;Hard Core&quot; in its list of &quot;Essential Recordings of the 90&#x27;s&quot;. In 2003, &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;Track for track, &quot;Hard Core&quot;″s thuggette-auctioneering flow melds the perfect hybrid of yoni power Mafioso and Park Avenue duchess.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; concluded in reviewing the album in the magazine&#x27;s 2004 version of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;:
Hip-hop had never seen anything like Brooklynite Kimberly Jones at the time of her solo debut: She single-handedly raised the bar for raunchy lyrics in hip-hop, making male rappers quiver with fear with lines like &quot;You ain&#x27;t lickin&#x27; this, you ain&#x27;t stickin&#x27; this . . . I don&#x27;t want dick tonight/Eat my pussy right&quot; (&quot;Not Tonight&quot;). Riding the wing of Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Ready to Die&quot; and Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, Kim&#x27;s &quot;Hard Core&quot; helped put East Coast hip-hop back on top in the late &#x27;90s. The album&#x27;s overreliance on old &#x27;70s funk samples doesn&#x27;t detract a bit from the Queen Bee&#x27;s fearless rhymes: In &quot;Dreams&quot;, she demands service fom R. Kelly, Babyface, and nearly every &quot;R&amp;B dick&quot; in the field. A landmark of bold, hilarious filth.
LL Cool J&#x27;s website rockthebells.com wrote that &quot;Kim&#x27;s high glamour, sex appeal and commercial success made her a new standard for female rappers.&quot; In July 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Hard Core&quot; as the 78th best debut album of all time.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Hard Core&quot; debuted and peaked at number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling 78,000 copies in its first week. Despite not spending another week inside the top 30, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 14, 2001, and had sold 1.5 million copies in the United States by June 2000. In Canada, the album peaked at number 62. As of November 2016, &quot;Hard Core&quot; had sold over five million copies worldwide.

In August 2018, the album entered the top 10 Hip Hop/Rap Albums chart on iTunes, reaching number six despite the album being released nearly 22 years prior and eventually reached number one for a short time. It also peaked at number 22 on the overall albums chart on iTunes.

<text>Havok is a middleware software suite developed by the Irish company Havok. Havok provides physics engine, navigation, and cloth simulation components that can be integrated into video game engines.

In 2007, Intel acquired Havok Inc. In 2008, Havok was honored at the 59th Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the development of physics engines in electronic entertainment. In 2015, Microsoft acquired Havok.

==Products==
The Havok middleware suite consists of the following modules:

* Havok Physics: Originally from Ipion Software (Ipion Virtual Physics), it is designed primarily for video games, and allows for real-time collision and dynamics of rigid bodies in three dimensions. It provides multiple types of dynamic constraints between rigid bodies (e.g. for ragdoll physics), and has a highly optimized collision detection library. By using dynamical simulation, Havok Physics allows for more realistic virtual worlds in games. The company was developing a specialized version of Havok Physics called Havok FX that made use of ATI and Nvidia GPUs for physics simulations, but the goal of GPU acceleration did not materialize until several years later.
* Havok Navigation: In 2009, Havok released Havok AI, which provides advanced pathfinding capabilities for games. Havok AI provides navigation mesh generation, pathfinding and path following for video game environments. In 2024, this product was renamed to Havok Navigation.
* Havok Cloth: Released in 2008, Havok Cloth deals with efficient simulation of character garments and soft body dynamics.
* Havok Destruction (discontinued): Also released in 2008, Havok Destruction provides tools for creation of destructible and deformable rigid body environments.
* Havok Animation Studio (discontinued): Havok Animation Studio is formally known as Havok Behavior and Havok Animation. Havok Behavior is a runtime SDK for controlling game character animation at a high level using finite-state machines. Havok Animation provides efficient playback and compression of character animations in games, and features such as inverse kinematics.
* Havok Script (discontinued): Havok Script is a Lua-compatible virtual machine designed for video game development. It is shipped as part of the Havok Script Studio.
* Havok Vision Engine (discontinued): In 2011, Havok acquired German game engine development company Trinigy and their Vision Engine and toolset.

==Supported platforms==
Version 1.0 of the Havok SDK was unveiled at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in 2000. The Havok SDK is multi-platform by nature and is always updated to run on the majority of the latest platforms. Licensees are given access to most of the C/C++ source-code, giving them the freedom to customize the engine&#x27;s features, or port it to different platforms although some libraries are only provided in binary format. In March 2011, Havok showed off a version of the Havok physics engine designed for use with the Sony Xperia Play, or more specifically, Android 2.3. During Microsoft&#x27;s //BUILD/ 2012 conference, Havok unveiled a full technology suite for Windows 8, Windows RT, Windows Phone 8 and later Windows 10.

As of February 2023, Havok supports 18 targets across 10 platforms. These platforms include: Windows, Linux, Xbox Series S/X, Playstation 5, iOS, Nintendo Switch and Android.

== Prebuilt engines ==
=== Unity ===
In 2019, Unity and Havok signed a partnership to build a complete physics solution for DOTS-based projects in Unity. This was completed and released as production ready in December 2022.

=== Unreal Engine ===
Havok maintains integrations for all of their products to Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine. Havok Physics can be used to replace the inbuilt physics engine (Chaos Physics) at an engine level, while Havok Navigation is a stand alone plugin, and Havok Cloth is a separate tool that works alongside the engine.

=== Babylon.js ===
In April 2023, Babylon.js 6.0 was released with a physics implementation by Havok. This implementation was released as a WASM plugin and involved an overhaul of the Babylon.js Physics API.

==Usage==
=== Video games ===

The first game to use Havok Physics was &quot;London Racer&quot; by Davilex Games. In 2023, Havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the United States. 

===Other software===
Havok can also be found in:
* Futuremark&#x27;s 3DMark2001 and 03 benchmarking tools
* a plug-in for Maya animation software
* Valve&#x27;s Source game engine uses VPhysics, which is a physics engine modified from Havok
* Havok addons in 3D Studio Max

Havok supplies tools (the &quot;Havok Content Tools&quot;) for export of assets for use with all Havok products from Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya, and (formerly) Autodesk Softimage. Havok was also used in the virtual world &quot;Second Life&quot;, with all physics handled by its online simulator servers, rather than by the users&#x27; client computers. An upgrade to Havok version 4 was released in April 2008 and an upgrade to version 7 started in June 2010. &quot;Second Life&quot; resident Emilin Nakamori constructed a weight-driven, pendulum-regulated mechanical clock functioning entirely by Havok Physics in March 2019.

<text>Jurōjin (, &quot;Old Man of Longevity&quot;) is one of Japanese mythology&#x27;s Seven Gods of Fortune or . He is the god of longevity. Jurōjin originated from the Chinese Taoist god, the Old Man of the South Pole or Star of the Old Man. He is known as the immortal of the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), and may have been a historical figure of the period. Jurōjin is identified as the personification of the imagined Southern Polar Star. While paintings and statues of Jurōjin are considered auspicious, he never developed a following in Japan independent of the other Seven Gods of Fortune.

People believe himself as the God of Wisdom and longevity had been live in the world for 1500 years. People respect to acquire safety and happy living.

Jurōjin is often identified with Fukurokuju, another of the Seven Gods of Fortune. In some accounts, the two are said to inhabit the same body. As such, the two are often confused.

Jurōjin walks with a staff and a fan. He is depicted as an old man of slight stature, and by tradition, less than 3 shaku (approximately ). He is depicted with a long white beard and often a very tall, bald head. He has a scroll tied to his staff, on which is written the lifespan of all living things. The scroll is sometimes identified as a Buddhist sutra. The deer, a symbol of longevity, usually (but not always) accompanies him as a messenger, as do other long-lived animals such as the crane and the tortoise.

Jurōjin is a popular subject of Japanese ink wash paintings. He was introduced into the Japanese art tradition by Zen Buddhist painters, and depictions of Jurōjin span from the Muromachi period (1337–1573) through the Edo period (1603–1868). Artists who depicted Jurōjin as a subject include Sesshū (1420–1506), Sesson Shukei (1504–1589), Kanō Tan&#x27;yū (1602–1674), and Maruyama Ōkyo (1733–1795).

<text>The Arkley is an English automobile that was manufactured by John Britten Garages workshops at Arkley in the London Borough of Barnet.

The first model was a two-seater called &quot;Arkley SS&quot;, designed by John Britten in 1970 (not to be confused with the famous New Zealand motorcycle designer, John Britten).

The retro &quot;bug-eyed&quot; design was inspired by a mixture of the Morgan and the original Austin-Healey Sprite. The main purpose was recycling old rusty or damaged Austin-Healey Sprites or MG Midgets. The Arkley SS utilised a BMC A-Series engine launched by Austin in 1951.

The &quot;Arkley Midget&quot; used fibre glass front and rear ends fitted to the donor car. Transformation did not affect the main structural members. There were two versions, the S for standard wheels and the SS for wide wheels.

Peter May, who had worked with John Britten Garages, founded &quot;Peter May Engineering&quot; in Halesowen in 1979 and bought the manufacturing rights to the Arkley in 1987. Production of the DIY fiberglass kits continues via Peter May Engineering, from their workshops in Ombersley, Worcestershire.

Since 1971, around 1000 kits have been sold, but the surviving number today is unknown.

Some kits were modified, such as a one-off called &quot;Pink Bathtub&quot;, produced in 1990.

<doc id="857614" wikidata="Q6016710" url="?curid=857614" title="Independent Labour Party (Manitoba, pre-1920)">
<text>Before World War I, there were at least two organizations in Winnipeg calling themselves the Independent Labour Party. The first of these was set up in 1895, and collapsed soon thereafter.

The second was created in 1906, following a visit to the city from Ramsay MacDonald. The party received support from members of Arthur Puttee&#x27;s Winnipeg Labour Party, which had been moribund since 1904.

Like other groups of the same name, this Independent Labour Party was a reformist organization. It was opposed by members of the more radical Socialist Party of Canada.

The ILP nominated Kempton McKim to contest the riding of Winnipeg West in the provincial election of 1907. McKim called for labour standards legislation and the public ownership of utilities. He was defeated by Thomas Johnson, a popular figure from the left wing of the Liberal Party.

In 1908, some members agitated for the ILP to officially declare itself as socialist. They were opposed by another group, led by moderate reformer Fred Dixon (later a member of the provincial legislature). The controversy split the party, which ceased to exist as a viable organization after June 1908. The reformist faction of the ILP regrouped as the Manitoba Labour Party for the 1910 provincial election.

In 1914-15, candidates nominated by the Labour Representation Committee officially ran for the &quot;Independent Labor Party&quot;, even though no formal organization of that name seems to have existed at the time.

J.S. Woodsworth helped launch a new Independent Labour Party in 1919. He would be elected as MP under that banner in 1921. This ILP went on to be one of the founding organizations of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party, a predecessor to the New Democratic Party.

<text>The [[MOS Technology]] &quot;Agnus&quot;, usually called Agnus, is an integrated circuit in the custom chipset of the Amiga computer. The Agnus, Denise and Paula chips collectively formed the OCS and ECS chipsets.

The Agnus is the Address Generator Chip. Its main function, in chip area, is the RAM Address Generator and Register Address Encoder which handles all DMA addresses. The 8361 Agnus is made up of approximately 21000 transistors and contains DMA Channel Controllers. The Blitter and Copper are also contained here. Originally Agnus was fabricated in 5 μm manufacturing process like all OCS chipset.

Agnus features:
* Memory controller (&quot;Chip&quot; memory that can be accessed by the processor and the chipset)
* The Blitter, a bitmap manipulator. The Blitter is capable of copying blocks of display data, or any arbitrary data in the chip memory, at high speed with various raster operations as well as drawing pixel perfect lines and filling outlined polygons, while freeing the CPU for concurrent tasks.
* &quot;Copper&quot;, a display synchronized co-processor
* 25 Direct Memory Access (DMA) channels, allowing graphics, sound and I/O to be used with minimal CPU intervention
* DRAM refresh controller
* Generates the system clock from the 28 MHz oscillator
* Video timing

Agnus was replaced by Alice in the Amiga 4000 and Amiga 1200 when the AGA chipset was introduced in 1992.

<text>In Japan, Fukurokuju (; from Japanese &quot;fuku&quot;, &quot;happiness&quot;; &quot;roku&quot;, &quot;wealth&quot;; and &quot;ju&quot;, &quot;longevity&quot;) is one of the Seven Lucky Gods in Japanese mythology. It has been theorized that he is a Japanese assimilation of the Chinese Three Star Gods (Fu Lu Shou) embodied in one deity. Most related in appearance to the Chinese star god Shou, he is the God of wisdom and longevity. According to some, before attaining divinity, he was a Chinese hermit of the Song dynasty and a reincarnation of the Taoist Deity, Xuantian Shangdi. It is said that during his human incarnation, he was a sennin; a immortal who could exist without eating food.

Fukurokuju probably originated from an old Chinese tale about a mythical Chinese Taoist hermit sage renowned for performing miracles in the Northern Song period (960–1127). In China, this hermit (also known as Jurōjin) was thought to embody the celestial powers of the south polar star. Fukurokuju was not always included in the earliest representations of the Seven in Japan. He was instead replaced by Kisshōten (goddess of fortune, beauty, and merit). He is now, however, an established member of the Seven Lucky Gods. 

He is sometimes confused with Jurōjin, another of the Several Gods of Fortune, who by some accounts is Fukurokuju&#x27;s grandson and by other accounts inhabits the same body as Fukurokuju. 
As such, the two are often confused.

Fukurokuju is usually portrayed as bald with long whiskers and an elongated forehead. He is said to be an incarnation of the &quot;Southern Polestar&quot; (南极老人, literally Old Man of the South Pole), also known as the star Canopus outside of Asia. The sacred book tied to his staff either contains the lifespan of every person on earth or a magical scripture. He is accompanied by a crane and a turtle, which are considered to be symbols of longevity. He is also sometimes accompanied by a black deer (ancient legends say a deer turns black if it is over 2000 years old).

He is the only member of the Seven Lucky Gods credited with the ability to resurrect the dead.

<text>Arkon is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema, the character first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #75 (April 1970). He is the warlord and ruler of the extra-dimensional world of Polemachus. 

== Development ==

=== Concept and creation ===
The concept of the character is that he is a hero from the sword-and-sorcery genre, in a world of modern superheroes. During an interview with co-creator John Buscema, Roy Thomas recalled, &quot;We introduced another one of our more popular creations, Arkon the Magnificent. He had the feel of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; John Carter of Mars crossed with Conan.&quot;

=== Publication history ===

Arkon debuted in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #75 (April 1970), and was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema.

==Fictional character biography==
Arkon was born of noble lineage on the extra-dimensional world Polemachus. The people of the Realm of Polemachus developed a culture that glorifies warfare, and Arkon succeeded in becoming the greatest warrior of his people. Appointed Imperion (ruler) of the largest country on Polemachus, Arkon mounted military campaigns against neighboring countries in an effort to conquer the world. His dreams were forgotten when Polemachus was faced with a worldwide catastrophe in that the light-and heat-providing planetary rings were disintegrating. Arkon&#x27;s scientists determined that atomic explosions occurring on Earth somehow were extra-dimensionally translated to rekindle the energy rings for about a year. Although Polemachus had not developed nuclear weaponry, the scientists predicted that if they were to atomically annihilate the Earth, their world&#x27;s energy-rings would be restored to power.

Toward this goal, Arkon manipulated the Scarlet Witch into reciting a magical spell found in a Polemachian book to enable Arkon to transport himself to Earth. Attracted to the Scarlet Witch and intending to marry her, Arkon kidnapped her as well as a group of atomic scientists. The scientists were forced to construct an atomic device. Before Arkon could detonate it on Earth, however, Scarlet Witch&#x27;s super team, the Avengers battled Arkon. Iron Man and Thor managed to rekindle Polemachus&#x27; energy-rings via a super device devised by Stark, and Arkon ceased hostilities with Earth.

The Avengers had cause to revisit Arkon&#x27;s world when their comrade, the Black Knight, was taken captive by Arkon while searching for the Well at the Center of Time. Arkon ceased hostilities with the Avengers when he learned that he was being duped by the Asgardian Amora the Enchantress, and later reconciled with the Avengers.

Although his world now possessed the capacity for atomic weapons, Arkon was dissatisfied with the length of time it took to build a nuclear arsenal. Thus, he devised a plan to pit three extra-dimensional worlds, one of which was Earth, against one another, in hopes that the energy from the resultant nuclear conflagration could be absorbed by his world. His elaborate machinations failed, due to the efforts of the Fantastic Four.

Arkon was forced to return to Earth yet again when the machine that Iron Man had once built to rekindle Polemachus&#x27; rings failed due to Arkon&#x27;s tinkering with it. Arkon traveled to Earth to recruit Thor to recharge the machine, but since Thor had left the Avengers at that time, he settled for the mutant X-Man known as Storm, who also had the ability to summon lightning, forcing her teammates to go after them. After a monumental struggle, the conflict was settled amicably. Storm through Cyclops&#x27; optic blasts helped re-energize the Energy Ring, and Arkon returned Storm and her allies to Earth. Another time, the X-Men and the Fantastic Four helped Arkon drive off an extra-dimensional invasion of Polemachus by the alien race of Badoon. After this adventure, Arkon and Storm confessed their mutual attraction for each other, and even shared a kiss, but agreed that circumstances were not right for them to pursue a relationship.

Arkon was later prodded via a dream-suggestion to return to Earth because a Hollywood movie had been made about him. This subliminal coaxing was from Amora the Enchantress. She had been given the task of killing Doctor Strange during the &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; campaign (where all the major villains teamed up and tried to see if &quot;swapping&quot; foes would result in the defeat of their heroic enemies). Arkon fought Wonder Man to punish him for appearing in the &quot;Arkon&quot; movies, and told him to warn the studio not to make any more. The Enchantress tricks Arkon into battling Dr Strange, but with the help of Clea, they are able to defeat her.

Some time later, Arkon traveled to Earth to employ the Avengers West Coast and Fantastic Four as pawns in his war with rival otherworldly monarch Thundra, until he made peace with Thundra after realizing they shared a strong mutual attraction. Later, with Thundra as his consort, Arkon sought Avengers&#x27; aid in repairing Polemachus&#x27; energy ring and protecting the maiden Astra from becoming a human sacrifice to Polemachus&#x27; religious zealots led by the high priest Anskar.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Arkon finds himself on the Battleworld domain of Weirdworld. After many failed attempts to find his kingdom Polemachus, Arkon finally arrived at the end of the Weirdworld and discovered it was a floating island. He was ready to step off the cliff to meet his fate on the ground below when an uncontrolled dragon appeared from nowhere. Seeing this as his opportunity to finally find his kingdom, Arkon stole the beast from the ogres that tried to control it and rode it through Weirdworld&#x27;s sky only to be caught by apes who used a strange fish and a line to fish the dragon out of the sky to the bottom of the sea. Imprisoned alone in a cell with his hands bound, Arkon resorts to brute force running headfirst into the walls to escape his captivity in Apelantis. While it does not result in his escape, Arkon&#x27;s actions attract the attention of a crystalline being named Warbow. Warbow explains to Arkon that while he has been able to escape the prison on his own, he is always recaptured by the underwater apes before he could reach the surface of the lagoon. Warbow offers to assist Arkon in escaping in the hopes that they both can manage it together and save his captive prince Crystar where they find his pieces in a bag. As Arkon fights off the underwater apes, he dreams of the home he seeks to return to. As he describes the world, he comes to the sad realization that he is losing his memory of his home. After reaching a safe place, Warbow gave Arkon his map as he had promised. But to Arkon&#x27;s surprise, it had many places he had not ever seen in his journey through Weirdworld. Enraged, Arkon left Warbow behind and continued his quest for Polemachus. Lost, Arkon ended up in the &quot;Swayin&#x27; Saloon&quot; where Skull the Slayer was waiting for him.

While drinking, Skull the Slayer revealed to Arkon that he was sent by Morgan le Fay to kill him and both started to fight. In a failed attempt of killing himself as well as his enemy, Arkon cut the ropes that kept the saloon suspended and they fell into the swamp below. When Arkon regained consciousness after the fall, he found himself trapped in vines and surrounded by the Man-Things. Arkon began to hallucinate about seeing Polemachus upside down when Skull freed him from the vines by attacking him fiercely. Arkon managed to get one of his Battle-Bolts and overcame his enemy. Before he could kill him, he was immobilized by the burning touch of one of the Man-Things. This time, Arkon hallucinated about his worst fear...Polemachus burning in front of his eyes. The hallucination ended with the arrival of the Swamp Queen of the Man-Things, a version of Jennifer Kale who is behind the rebellion against Morgan le Fay. After a brief conversation with the two warriors, the Swamp Queen forced them to face their fears in order to survive it and become her allies against le Fay. However, only Skull accepted the offer to become her ally. Arkon fled from the Forest of the Man-Things having remembered the path which led to Polemachus. Upon reaching the rock that was supposed to be the entrance to his kingdom, Arkon found himself yet again in front of a cliff at the end of Weirdworld. Filled with sadness and rage, Arkon pointed one of his Battle-Bolts towards his own belly ready to kill himself, unknowing that Polemachus was in fact in Weirdworld, suspended upside down as the underside of the floating island. At the last minute, Arkon gave up on killing himself preferring to use his rage to conquer Weirdworld in order to turn it into his new kingdom instead. He was confronted by the Witch Queen le Fay and her army of ogres. Having been hit by a missile launched by the ogres, Arkon fell from Weirdworld and finally saw his kingdom under it before being saved from certain death by the Swamp Queen and her Man-Things who were accompanied by an army composed of the other inhabitants of Weirdworld including Skull the Slayer, Warbow, an army of Elves, an army of Eyemazons, an army of Man-Wolves, and the resurrected Crystar. A fierce battle ensued between the Swamp Queen&#x27;s forces and le Fay&#x27;s forces for the fate of Weirdworld. However, none of them emerged victorious as Battleworld collapsed after God Emperor Doom was defeated during the Secret War. With Weirdworld now a part of Earth-616 and located in the Bermuda Triangle, Arkon resumed his journey to find Polemachus.

In &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Arkon is still searching for Polemachus and comes across the survivors of the airplane that crash-landed onto Weirdworld in the Bermuda Triangle. He saves them and tells them that they need to get away from the plane wreck.

When Arkon was sighted on Earth, Thundra and Tyndall arrived to look for help in finding him. Their search for Arkon was interrupted by the arrival of Warbow and his Crystal Warriors, the Magma Men, and the Savage Elves of Klarn as Thundra tells Tyndall to find the Squadron Supreme. When the Squadron Supreme, Tyndall, and Thundra end up on Weirdworld, they are ambushed by Arkon. It was discovered that Arkon has been possessed by an evil madness as he assists Modred and Warrior Woman into taking down Nighthawk, Blur, and Tyndall. When the three of them bring Nighthawk, Blur, and Tyndall to a specific castle, they find it inhabited by a revived Doctor Druid.

==Powers and abilities==
Arkon possesses a range of superhuman abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and durability. He also has an accelerated healing factor, enabling him to rapidly heal damaged tissue should he sustain injury. While all of his people possess these same physical attributes, Arkon&#x27;s are much more developed than the majority of his race.

He is a cunning military strategist. He is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and swordsman, and is highly skilled in the usage of his throwing weapons, which were designed by the scientists and craftsmen of Polemachus. Arkon wields a collection of three energy weapons shaped like stylized lightning bolts that he carries in a quiver. Each of these bolts has a specific function and color. The golden bolts are used to open gateways to different dimensional planes. The scarlet and black bolts are used as offensive weapons and generate powerful explosive blasts when they hit their target. He also carries a shield.

Arkon has been known to ride dinosaur-like reptilian mounts, some of which walk on two legs and others on four. Other reptilian mounts he uses have wings enabling them to carry him through the air.

<text>Vernacular architecture (also folk architecture) is building done outside any academic tradition, and without professional guidance. It is not a particular architectural movement or style, but rather a broad category, encompassing a wide range and variety of building types, with differing methods of construction, from around the world, both historical and extant and classical and modern. Vernacular architecture constitutes 95% of the world&#x27;s built environment, as estimated in 1995 by Amos Rapoport, as measured against the small percentage of new buildings every year designed by architects and built by engineers.

Vernacular architecture usually serves immediate, local needs, is constrained by the materials available in its particular region and reflects local traditions and cultural practices. The study of vernacular architecture does not examine formally schooled architects, but instead that of the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. More recently, vernacular architecture has been examined by designers and the building industry in an effort to be more energy conscious with contemporary design and construction—part of a broader interest in sustainable design.

As of 1986, even among scholars publishing in the field, the exact boundaries of &quot;vernacular&quot; have not been clear.

:This issue of definition, apparently so simple, has proven to be one of the most serious problems for advocates of vernacular architecture and landscapes research. A straightforward, convincing, authoritative definition has not yet been offered. Vernacular architecture is a phenomenon that many understand intuitively but that few are able to define. The literature on the subject is thus filled with what might be called non-definitions. Vernacular architecture is &quot;non&quot;-high style building, it is those structures &quot;not&quot; designed by professionals; it is &quot;not&quot; monumental; it is &quot;un&quot;-sophisticated; it is &quot;mere&quot; building; it is, according to the distinguished historian Nikolaus Pevsner, &quot;not&quot; architecture. Those who take a more positive approach rely on adjectives like ordinary, everyday, and commonplace. While these terms are not as pejorative as other descriptive phrases that are sometimes applied to the vernacular, neither are they very precise. For example, the skyscrapers of Manhattan are works of high style architecture, but they are also commonplace in Manhattan. Are they not logically New York City vernacular buildings?

Vernacular architecture tends to be overlooked in traditional histories of design. It is not a stylistic description, much less one specific style, so it cannot be summarized in terms of easy-to-understand patterns, characteristics, materials, or elements. Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders, vernacular buildings are considered cultural expressions—aboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, ethnic, or regional—as much as architectural artifacts.

== Evolution of the phrase ==

The term &quot;&quot; means &#x27;domestic, native, indigenous&#x27;, from &quot;verna&quot; &#x27;native slave&#x27; or &#x27;home-born slave&#x27;. The word probably derives from an older Etruscan word.

The term is borrowed from linguistics, where vernacular refers to language use particular to a time, place, or group.

The phrase dates to at least 1857, when it was used by Sir George Gilbert Scott, as the focus of the first chapter of his book &quot;Remarks on Secular &amp; Domestic Architecture, Present &amp; Future&quot;, and in a paper read to an architectural society in Leicester in October of that year. As a proponent of the Gothic Revival movement in England, Scott used the term as a pejorative to refer to the &quot;prevailing architecture&quot; in England of the time, all of it, as opposed to the Gothic he wanted to introduce. In this &quot;vernacular&quot; category Scott included St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Greenwich Hospital, London, and Castle Howard, although admitting their relative nobility.

The term was popularized with positive connotations in a 1964 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, designed by architect Bernard Rudofsky, with a subsequent book. Both were called &quot;Architecture Without Architects&quot;. Featuring dramatic black-and-white photography of vernacular buildings around the world, the exhibition was extremely popular. Rudofsky brought the concept into the eye of the public and of mainstream architecture, and also kept the definitions loose: he wrote that the exhibition &quot;attempts to break down our narrow concepts of the art of building by introducing the unfamiliar world of nonpedigree architecture. It is so little known that we don&#x27;t even have a name for it. For want of a generic label we shall call it vernacular, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be.&quot; The book was a reminder of the legitimacy and &quot;hard-won knowledge&quot; inherent in vernacular buildings, from Polish salt-caves to gigantic Syrian water wheels to Moroccan desert fortresses and was considered iconoclastic at the time.

The term &quot;commercial vernacular&quot; was popularized in the late 1960s by the publication of &quot;Learning from Las Vegas&quot; by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, referring to 20th-century American suburban tract and commercial architecture. 

Although vernacular architecture might be designed by people who do have some training in design, in 1971 Ronald Brunskill nonetheless defined vernacular architecture as:
...a building designed by an amateur without any training in design; the individual will have been guided by a series of conventions built up in his locality, paying little attention to what may be fashionable. The function of the building would be the dominant factor, aesthetic considerations, though present to some small degree, being quite minimal. Local materials would be used as a matter of course, other materials being chosen and imported quite exceptionally.

In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World&quot; edited in 1997 by Paul Oliver of the Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development. Oliver argued that vernacular architecture, given the insights it gives into issues of environmental adaptation, will be necessary in the future to &quot;ensure sustainability in both cultural and economic terms beyond the short term.&quot; The encyclopedia defined the field of vernacular architecture as:
comprising the dwellings and all other buildings of the people. Related to their environmental contexts and available resources they are customarily owner- or community-built, utilizing traditional technologies. All forms of vernacular architecture are built to meet specific needs, accommodating the values, economies and ways of life of the cultures that produce them.

In 2007 Allen Noble wrote a lengthy discussion of the relevant terms, in &quot;Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions.&quot; Noble concluded that &quot;folk architecture&quot; is built by &quot;persons not professionally trained in building arts.&quot; &quot;Vernacular architecture&quot; is &quot;of the common people&quot;, but may be built by trained professionals, using local, traditional designs and materials. &quot;Traditional architecture&quot; is architecture passed down from person to person, generation to generation, particularly orally, but at any level of society, not just by common people. &quot;Primitive architecture&quot; is a term Noble discourages the use of. The term popular architecture is used more in Eastern Europe and is synonymous with folk or vernacular architecture.

==Vernacular and the architect==

Architecture designed by professional architects is usually not considered to be vernacular. Indeed, it can be argued that the very process of consciously designing a building makes it not vernacular. Paul Oliver, in his book &quot;Dwellings&quot;, states: &quot;it is contended that &#x27;popular architecture&#x27; designed by professional architects or commercial builders for popular use, does not come within the compass of the vernacular&quot;. Oliver also offers the following simple definition of vernacular architecture: &quot;the architecture of the people, and by the people, but not for the people.&quot;

Frank Lloyd Wright described vernacular architecture as &quot;Folk building growing in response to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them with native feeling&quot;. suggesting that it is a primitive form of design, lacking intelligent thought, but he also stated that it was &quot;for us better worth study than all the highly self-conscious academic attempts at the beautiful throughout Europe&quot;.

Since at least the Arts and Crafts Movement, many modern architects have studied vernacular buildings and claimed to draw inspiration from them, including aspects of the vernacular in their designs. In 1946, the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy was appointed to design the town of New Gourna near Luxor. Having studied traditional Nubian settlements and technologies, he incorporated the traditional mud brick vaults of the Nubian settlements in his designs. The experiment failed, due to a variety of social and economic reasons.

Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa is considered the pioneer of regional modernism in South Asia. Along with him, modern proponents of the use of the vernacular in architectural design include Charles Correa, a well known Indian architect; Muzharul Islam and Bashirul Haq, internationally known Bangladeshi architects; Balkrishna Doshi, another Indian, who established the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation in Ahmedabad to research the vernacular architecture of the region; and Sheila Sri Prakash who has used rural Indian architecture as an inspiration for innovations in environmental and socio-economically sustainable design and planning. The Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck was also a proponent of vernacular architecture, as were Samuel Mockbee, Christopher Alexander, and Paolo Soleri.

Oliver claims that:
As yet there is no clearly defined and specialized discipline for the study of dwellings or the larger compass of vernacular architecture. If such a discipline were to emerge it would probably be one that combines some of the elements of both architecture and anthropology with aspects of history and geography.

Architects have developed a renewed interest in vernacular architecture as a model for sustainable design. Contemporary complementary architecture is informed largely by vernacular architecture.

==Influences on the vernacular==

Vernacular architecture is influenced by a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building is subject to the same laws of physics, and hence will demonstrate significant similarities in structural forms.

===Climate===
One of the most significant influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation. They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or even absent altogether. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building.
Buildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons. In hot arid and semi-arid regions, vernacular structures typically include a number of distinctive elements to provide for ventilation and temperature control. Across the middle east, these elements included such design features as courtyard gardens with water features, screen walls, reflected light, &quot;mashrabiya&quot; (the distinctive oriel window with timber latticework) and &quot;bad girs&quot; (wind-catchers). 

Buildings take different forms depending on precipitation levels in the region – leading to dwellings on stilts in many regions with frequent flooding or rainy monsoon seasons. For example, the Queenslander is an elevated weatherboard house with a sloped, tin roof that evolved in the early 19th-century as a solution to the annual flooding caused by monsoonal rain in Australia&#x27;s northern states. Flat roofs are rare in areas with high levels of precipitation. Similarly, areas with high winds will lead to specialised buildings able to cope with them, and buildings tend to present minimal surface area to prevailing winds and are often situated low on the landscape to minimise potential storm damage.

Climatic influences on vernacular architecture are substantial and can be extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that of much of the Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work. Vernacular architecture is also used for the purposes of local citizens.

===Culture===
The way of life of building occupants, and the way they use their shelters, is of great influence on building forms. The size of family units, who shares which spaces, how food is prepared and eaten, how people interact, and many other cultural considerations will affect the layout and size of dwellings.

For example, the family units of several East African ethnic communities live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different members of the family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons who are too old to share space with the women of the family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms.

Culture also has a great influence on the appearance of vernacular buildings, as occupants often decorate buildings in accordance with local customs and beliefs.

====Nomadic dwellings====

There are many cultures around the world which include some aspect of nomadic life, and they have all developed vernacular solutions for the need for shelter. These all include appropriate responses to climate and customs of their inhabitants, including practicalities of simple construction such as huts, and if necessary, transport such as tents.

The Inuit have a number of different forms of shelter appropriate to different seasons and geographical locations, including the igloo (for winter) and the tupiq (for summer). The Sami of Northern Europe, who live in climates similar to those experienced by the Inuit, have developed different shelters appropriate to their culture including the lavvu and goahti. The development of different solutions in similar circumstances because of cultural influences is typical of vernacular architecture.

Many nomadic people use materials common in the local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their gers (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in Iran. Notable in each case is the significant impact of the availability of materials and the availability of pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters.

All the shelters are adapted to suit the local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are versatile enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperatures of Mongolian winters and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A traditional Berber tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – and because of the climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.

====Permanent dwellings====
The type of structure and materials used for a dwelling vary depending on how permanent it is. Frequently moved nomadic structures will be lightweight and simple, more permanent ones will be less so. When people settle somewhere permanently, the architecture of their dwellings will change to reflect that.

Materials used will become heavier, more solid and more durable. They may also become more complicated and more expensive, as the capital and labour required to construct them is a one-time cost. Permanent dwellings often offer a greater degree of protection and shelter from the elements. In some cases, however, where dwellings are subjected to severe weather conditions such as frequent flooding or high winds, buildings may be deliberately &quot;designed&quot; to fail and be replaced, rather than requiring the uneconomical or even impossible structures needed to withstand them. The collapse of a relatively flimsy, lightweight structure is also less likely to cause serious injury than a heavy structure.

Over time, dwellings&#x27; architecture may come to reflect a very specific geographical locale.

===Environment, construction elements and materials===
The local environment and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California redwood water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouses) were part of a self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.

Construction elements and materials frequently found in vernacular buildings include:
* Adobe – a type of mud brick, often covered with white-wash, commonly used in Spain and Spanish colonies
* Cob – a type of plaster made from subsoil with the addition of fibrous material to give added strength
* Mashrabiya (also known as shanashol in Iraq) – a type of oriel window with timber lattice-work, designed to allow ventilation, commonly found in Iraq and Egypt in upper-class homes
* Mud bricks – loam or sand mixed with water and vegetable matter such as straw
* Rammed earth often used in foundations
* Saddleback roof
* Thatch – dry vegetation used as roofing material
* Windcatcher – a type of chimney used to provide natural ventilation without the use of air conditioning, commonly found in Iran, Iraq and other parts of the Middle-East
* Wychert – a blend of white earth and clay

==Legal aspects==
As many jurisdictions introduce tougher building codes and zoning regulations, &quot;folk architects&quot; sometimes find themselves in conflict with the local authorities.

A case that made news in Russia was that of an Arkhangelsk entrepreneur Nikolay P. Sutyagin, who built what was reportedly the world&#x27;s tallest single-family wooden house for himself and his family, only to see it condemned as a fire hazard. The 13-storey, tall structure, known locally as &quot;Sutyagin&#x27;s skyscraper&quot; (Небоскрёб Сутягина), was found to be in violation of Arkhangelsk building codes, and in 2008 the courts ordered the building to be demolished by 1 February 2009. On 26 December 2008, the tower was pulled down, and the remainder was dismantled manually over the course of the next several months.

==Types and examples by region==


Inter-regional
* Bender tent – a temporary dwelling used by Nomadic people 
* Stilt house – a raised house found in monsoonal regions, especially monsoonal South Asia or other areas prone to flooding

Brazil
* Bustee – a dwelling made from waste materials, often associated with the slums of India or the favellas of Brazil

Canada
* Canadian Railway style – Railway stations built in Canada in the 19th and early 20th centuries were often simple wood structures that lacked decorative features. Some of these stations survive today but not as active railway stations.

Iraq
* Desert castles – (in Arabic, known as q&#x27;sar) fortified palaces or castles built during the Umayyad period, the ruins of which are now scattered across the semi-arid regions of north-eastern Jordan, Syria, Israel, Palestine and Iraq. These often served as hunting lodges for noble families.
* Mudhif – a traditional building constructed entirely of reeds and common to the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq. Many were destroyed by Saddam Hussein, but since 2003, Arab communities have been returning to their traditional homes and way of life.

Germany
* Gulf house
* Low German house
* Middle German house
* Old Frisian farmhouse

Indonesia
Israel
* Sukkah – a temporary dwelling for use during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. A sukkah must be made of organic materials, have three walls, and must have a roof that is partially open to the sky. The roof is typically made of branches or thatch.
* Four room house – Iron Age structures constructed of mud and stone. 
* Wild Bau cladding style – the practice of repurposing rubble from Israeli structures destroyed during wars and terrorist attacks in masonry, especially in Katamon.

Italy
* Alpine &#x27;barn&#x27; houses – dwellings built on the storey above the ground floor, which housed cattle during winter
* Dammuso (Dammusu) – dry stone housing of Pantelleria
* Sassi di Matera – cave dwellings
* Trullo – dry stone hut-shaped house with a conical roof

Norway
Philippines
* Torogan sleeping house in Mindanao, Philippines

Scotland

* Bastle house – a multi-storey, fortified farmhouse with sophisticated security measures designed to provide defense against the frequent raiding parties along the Scottish border.
* Blackhouse – a traditional dry-stone wall building, roofed with thatch of turf, a flagstone floor and central hearth, designed to accommodate livestock and people, separated by a partition.
* Crofters&#x27; cottage – a simple construction of stone walls filled with earth for insulation, a thatched or turf roof and stone slabs were set into the middle of the room for a peat fire which provided some form of central heating. An unusual croft house Brotchie&#x27;s Steading, Dunnet was built with whale bone couples.
* Cruck house – a medieval structure designed to cope with shortages of long-span timber. The frame of the structure uses &quot;siles&quot; or &quot;couples&quot; (a type of fork) for the end walls. The walls do not support the roof, which is instead carried on the cruck frame. This type of building is common throughout England, Scotland and Wales, although only a few intact examples have survived. 
* Shieling – a type of temporary hut (or a collection of huts) constructed of stone, sod and turf used as a dwelling during the summer months when highlanders took their livestock to higher ground in search of new pasture.
* Tower house or peel tower – a medieval building, typically of stone, constructed by the aristocratic classes as a defensible residence.

*Earl A. Young (born 31 March 1889 – 24 May 1975) was an American architect, realtor and insurance agent. Over a span of 52 years, he designed and built 31 structures in Charlevoix, Michigan but was never a registered architect. He worked mostly in stone, using limestone, fieldstone, and boulders he found throughout Northern Michigan. The homes are commonly referred to as gnome homes, mushroom houses, or Hobbit houses. His door, window, roof and fireplace designs were very distinct because of his use of curved lines. Young&#x27;s goal was to show that a small stone house could be as impressive as a castle. Young also helped make Charlevoix the busy, summer resort town that it is today.

Ukraine

Different regions in Ukraine have their own examples of vernacular architecture. For example, in the Carpathian Mountains and the surrounding foothills, wood and clay are the primary traditional building materials. Ukrainian architecture is preserved at the Museum of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central Naddnipryanshchyna located in Pereiaslav, Ukraine.

<text>An endplay (also &quot;throw-in&quot;), in bridge and similar games, is a tactical play where a defender is put on lead at a strategic moment, and then has to make a play that loses one or more tricks. Most commonly the losing play either constitutes a free finesse, or else it gives declarer a ruff and discard. In a case where declarer has no entries to dummy (or to his own hand), the defender may also be endplayed into leading a suit which can be won in that hand.

==Example==
 For example, South is declarer in 6 and West leads the diamond king. If the adverse spades are divided 2-1, there are 12 certain tricks (six spade tricks, two hearts, one diamond and three clubs) and the possibility of a 13th by correctly guessing the two-way finesse (or dropping the queen) in hearts. But if the spades are 3-0, declarer will need an endplay to avoid the heart guess.

He should start by winning the diamond ace and ruffing a diamond in dummy, then cash the spade ace and spade king. If this reveals a 3-0 trump split, he now ruffs another diamond in dummy. If this is not overruffed, the contract is now assured.

Declarer&#x27;s now plays the king, ace, and queen of clubs, discarding a heart from dummy to reach the end position shown below:
 Declarer exits with a spade, and whoever wins is endplayed. If the defender leads a heart, North-South must make three heart tricks; if a club or diamond, declarer will ruff in one hand and discard a heart from the other, making an extra trump trick. Or if the defender has fewer than three clubs and chooses to ruff before the above position is reached, he is likewise endplayed, having to lead a heart or a diamond.

==Combining Endplay and Squeeze==

A strip squeeze is a particular kind of squeeze that is based on endplaying the squeezed defender.

<text>Herminie Templeton Kavanagh (6 May 1861 – 30 October 1933) was an Irish writer, most known for her short stories.

==Early life and family==
Born Minnie Allen McGibney at the British army barracks in Aldershot, England, on 6 May 1861, she was the second of seven children born to Major George McGibney from Templemichael, County Longford, Ireland, and Caroline Allen from Coventry, England.

The family moved to Quebec, Canada in 1872. By 1880 Minnie lived in Manhattan with her widowed mother and six siblings and worked as a sales clerk.

Her first marriage was to vaudeville performer John Templeton. An article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; later stated that she had been abandoned by her first husband in Chicago circa 1893. After their separation, Minnie worked in Chicago as a clerk and stenographer. She adopted the name Herminie some time before 1900, and published her first writing in 1901.

She became Herminie Templeton Kavanagh after her second marriage, to Marcus Kavanagh (1859–1937), who was born in the USA to Irish immigrants, and who served as a Cook County judge in Chicago from 1898 to 1935. Accounts differ on how they met, as well as where and when they married, ranging from 1905 to 1908 in Dublin or Iowa.

She and Judge Kavanagh lived together in Chicago and Ocean Grove, New Jersey.

==Works==
Her best known work, &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Good People&quot; (), was first published as a series of stories under the name Herminie Templeton in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; magazine in 1901–1902, before being published as a book in the United States in 1903. A second edition, published a year before her death, was under the name Herminie T. Kavanagh. The &quot;Good People&quot; in the title refers to the fairies in Irish mythology; the English translation of &quot;aoine maithe&quot; is &quot;good people&quot;.

Her second published book, &quot;Ashes of Old Wishes and Other Darby O&#x27;Gill Tales&quot; (), was published in 1926. In 1959, Walt Disney released a film based on these two books, called &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot;.

She also wrote two plays, &quot;The Color Sergeant&quot; (1903), and &quot;Swift-Wing of the Cherokee&quot; (1903).

==Death==
She died of a heart ailment in Chicago on 30 October 1933, aged 72. She was buried in New York, her former home.

<doc id="857643" wikidata="Q6811946" url="?curid=857643" title="Melbourne tram route 112">
<text>Melbourne tram route 112 was operated by Yarra Trams on the Melbourne tram network from West Preston to St Kilda. The 18 kilometre route was operated out of East Preston depot with A, B and D2 class trams.

The route number was introduced in 2000, and was discontinued on 27 July 2014 as part of a wider timetable change to the Yarra Trams network. This saw route 112 replaced by routes 11 and 12.

==History==
The origins of route 112 lie in separate tram lines, a cable tram from Spencer Street to Fitzroy North, an electric line from Fitzroy North to West Preston and an electric line from the CBD to Fitzroy Street, St Kilda (partially built utilising a former cable line).

A cable line was opened from Spencer Street to Barkly Street, Fitzroy North along Collins Street, MacArthur Street, Gisborne Street, Victoria Parade, Brunswick Street and St Georges Road on 2 October 1886, by the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company.

After World War I, the municipal Fitzroy, Northcote &amp; Preston Tramways Trust constructed a stand-alone electric tram system, running from the cable tram terminus at Barkly Street, Fitzroy North, over the Merri Creek bridge, and up St Georges Road. Two branches split off at Miller Street, one to East Preston, the other to West Preston, up Gilbert Street to Regent Street, the terminus of the current route 11. The lines were taken over by the newly formed Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) before the first services ran, opening on 1 April 1920. This network was connected to the rest of the electric system and the CBD on 24 March 1925, when an east–west line from Lygon Street, Brunswick along Holden Street (with a dogleg up Pilkington Street and Barkly Street) was built.

On 31 October 1925, a new route to St Kilda via South Melbourne was opened by the MMTB, travelling from St Kilda Road along Sturt Street, Eastern Road, Heather Street, Park Street, Clarendon Street, Albert Road, Canterbury Road, Mills Street, Danks Street, Patterson Street, Park Street, Mary Street and Beaconsfield Parade.

In 1929, the MMTB started converting the Collins Street cable lines to electric traction, with the last cable tram running down Collins Street on 14 September 1929, and the first electric tram on 8 December 1929. The remaining section of cable tram track along Brunswick Street and St Georges Road was converted to electric traction by the MMTB on 26 October 1930, connecting the West Preston electric line to Collins Street.

The South Melbourne cable line was converted to electric traction by the MMTB on 25 July 1937, with the section of track between Clarendon Street and Hanna Street (now Kings Way) along City Road abandoned in favour of a new section of track along Clarendon Street, between City Road and Flinders Street. This allowed trams to travel from St Kilda to Collins Street, along Clarendon Street and Spencer Street.

On 8 November 1959, the track along Mary Street and Beaconsfield Parade, St Kilda West was abandoned in favour of a short extension along Park Street to Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, route 112&#x27;s final terminus.

From the 1950s until 1992, this line ran mainly as two separate routes which overlapped along Collins Street. Route 12, ran from the Fitzroy Street, St Kilda terminus to St Vincent&#x27;s Plaza, with the destinations being &#x27;South Melbourne - St Kilda Beach&#x27; and &#x27;City - Brunswick Street&#x27; respectively. Route 11 was similar to the current route, running from West Preston to the city, terminating at Spencer Street, where trams would reverse. The destinations were simply &#x27;West Preston&#x27; and &#x27;City&#x27;. A route 10 also operated out of peak hours, which traversed the whole line from West Preston to St Kilda Beach.

Route 10 was discontinued after 29 April 1995, with only routes 11 and 12 operating. In mid-2000, W-class trams were temporarily removed from service due to brake issues. As a result, on 7 August 2000, route 112 was introduced to replace routes 11 and 12 during weekdays, and was essentially a new number for the old route 10. It later (believed to be 9 September 2001) became a full-day service with route 11 becoming peak-hour only and route 12 withdrawn.

In 2005, route 112 was part of the Think&gt;Tram project, with measures aimed at improving tram services introduced to Clarendon Street, South Melbourne.

On 27 July 2014, route 112 was withdrawn and replaced by routes 11 and 12. This was part of the program by Yarra Trams to simplify the network and increase passenger capacity.

<doc id="857652" wikidata="Q3523343" url="?curid=857652" title="The Weirdos">
<text>The Weirdosare an American punk rock band from Los Angeles. They formed in 1975, split-up in 1981, re-grouped in 1986 and have remained semi-active ever since. Critic Mark Deming calls them &quot;quite simply, one of the best and brightest American bands of punk&#x27;s first wave.&quot;

==History==

===Formation===
The band was formed in 1975 by singer John Denney and his guitarist brother Dix (sons of Hollywood actress Nora Denney), initially using the band names the Barbies and the Luxurious Adults. The Weirdos were originally a 1950s-inspired hard rock and roll band that, like the Ramones in New York City, predated the UK punk scene. While initially trying to distance themselves from the genre name &quot;punk&quot; that was created in New York, ultimately the band, in the words of John Denney, &quot;just kinda became more like this punk ROCK N ROLL type thing and we kinda went with it because the fans wanted it. They wore us down and we just said &#x27;OK, fine! We&#x27;re punk rock, similar to the Ramones. Whatever you say.&#x27;&quot;

In a 1990 &quot;Flipside&quot; interview, John Denney listed the Ramones, New York Dolls and Iggy Pop as fundamental musical inspirations, adding:

&quot;When we saw the Ramones in &#x27;76, we already had short hair and we were already playing fast music like that in late 1975 in small venues and halls mostly, but the Ramones really made us decide to go for it even more. We came before the Sex Pistols and The Damned. They may have been our peers later, but we already had a set of songs in 1975 which were sort of Ramones meets Iggy Pop&#x27;s Stooges influenced punk songs. Well before any of the UK bands started cloning America&#x27;s punk sound and before any of the UK albums were released. I always felt we were a true garage punk band...&quot;

Denney claimed that the band&#x27;s name dated from the early part of the 1970s and referred to his countercultural short hair, at a time when long hair on men was the fashion of the day. &quot;In 1974 according to some left over hippies, I looked like a lobotomy, hippies thought I was weird,&quot; Denney said. &quot;A few months later when we formed, the rest of the band got really short cropped hair too. &quot;We were all weird then, we were considered weirdos&quot;.

By the second half of 1977, the Weirdos were able to pack clubs (eventually including the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy and later The Masque) as a headlining band. Known for their zany stage costumes and antics, the band helped shape the vigorous and experimental early Los Angeles punk scene and served as an inspiration to a crop of new bands.

John Denney recalled:

&quot;We [Los Angeles] had our own look, our own sound. It was apart from New York or London... We were staunchly against safety pins, we tried to parody punk rock at first. We did happy faces onstage as a joke sometimes, which was the exact opposite of what New York was doing. We were just thumbing our noses at everything. Everything was a joke; punk was a joke, we were a joke. Nonetheless, we were still serious about rocking.&quot;

===Recordings===
The Weirdos&#x27; first release was a 7-inch EP, &quot;Destroy All Music,&quot; released in 1977 on Greg Shaw&#x27;s Bomp! Records. It was followed by the 1978 single &quot;We Got the Neutron Bomb,&quot; released on the Los Angeles punk label Dangerhouse. The band later released two 12-inch EPs in 1979 and 1980.

The band were highly critical of some of their recordings and shady engineers, with John Denney characterizing the 1979–80 period as &quot;a big botch job&quot; marked by a series of &quot;aborted recording sessions.&quot; It was not until 1991 that a first volume of early recordings would be remixed by the band for release by Frontier Records as a compilation album, &quot;Weird World – Volume One 1977–1981&quot;. More than another decade would pass before a long-planned second compilation album of early tracks would see the light of day, issued by Frontier in 2003 as &quot;We Got The Neutron Bomb – Weird World Volume Two 1977–1989&quot;.

===Personnel===
The Denney brothers were the only constant members, though guitarist/bassist Cliff Roman, bassist Dave Trout and Bruce Moreland (also of Wall of Voodoo), and drummer Nickey &quot;Beat&quot; Alexander were relatively long-term Weirdos.

Dix Denney died on March 12, 2023, at the age of 65.

===Breakup and legacy===
The Weirdos broke up in 1981. Shortly after, Dix and John Denney published the album Warhead under the project name If-Then-Else. That same year Dix, Williams (bass) and Cliff Martinez, who briefly drummed for the band played on and co-wrote Lydia Lunch&#x27;s second solo album 13.13

Martinez, went on to join the Red Hot Chili Peppers, playing on the band&#x27;s first two albums. Dix Denney was also close to becoming a member of the Chili Peppers. However, after many practices with Denney, things didn&#x27;t work out and he was replaced by guitarist Jack Sherman.

LA-based rock band Symbol Six stated that the Weirdos were one of their biggest formative influences, and covered &quot;The Hideout&#x27;&quot; which appeared on their self-titled 2013 album on Dr. Strange Records, even creating a tribute video for the song that honored the Weirdos.

===Reformations===
The Weirdos have reunited several times, beginning in 1990. The resulting first full-length studio album, &quot;Condor,&quot; issued that year by Frontier, was an effort to &quot;re-establish ourselves as contemporary,&quot; according to John Denney.

A 2004 reunion included Circle Jerks bassist Zander Schloss and the Skulls drummer Sean Antillon in the lineup.

Another reformed edition of the Weirdos, featuring the Denney brothers, Schloss and Devo drummer Jeff Friedl, appeared at the Punk Rock Bowling and Music Festival in Las Vegas on May 25, 2013, followed by additional 2013–2014 shows in California, Denver and Austin, as well as an appearance at the Dangerhouse Records Night concert on November 29, 2014, at the Echoplex in Los Angeles.

In 2016, Bruce Moreland, the bassist from the 1978 version of the Weirdos, rejoined the band.

<text>The Armadale was an English automobile manufactured from 1906 to 1907 by Armadale Motors Ltd, Northwood, Middlesex, then Northwood Motor &amp; Engineering Works, also of Northwood.

==Models==
===Three wheel===
Initially called the Toboggan, the Armadale Tri-car, so-called the &quot;perfect little three-wheeler&quot; featured infinitely variable friction drive and a pressed steel chassis, unusual in a tricar. It used either a one-cylinder Aster or a 2-cylinder Fafnir engine.

===Four wheel===
In 1906, the company listed a conventional 4-wheeler with a 16 hp 4-cylinder engine.

==Tourist Trophy Race of 1906==
An Armadale car, owned or driven by A.C. Godwin Smith, was entered in the Tourist Trophy Race in the Isle of Man on 27 September 1906, but it did not start.

<doc id="857659" wikidata="Q851192" url="?curid=857659" title="List of rulers of Kongo">
<text>This is a list of the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], known commonly as the Manikongos (KiKongo: Mwenekongo). Mwene (plural: Awene) in Kikongo meant a person holding authority, particularly judicial authority, derived from the root -&quot;wene&quot; which meant &quot;territory (over which jurisdiction was held)&quot;. The ruler of Kongo was the most powerful &quot;mwene&quot; in the region who the Portuguese regarded as the king (in Kikongo &quot;ntinu&quot;) upon their arrival in 1483.

The kings claimed several titles and the following royal style in Portuguese &quot;Pela graça de Deus Rei do Congo, do Loango, de Cacongo e de Ngoio, aquém e além do Zaire, Senhor dos Ambundos e de Angola, de Aquisima, de Musuru, de Matamba, de Malilu, de Musuko e Anzizo, da conquista de Pangu-Alumbu, etc&quot;, that means &quot;By the grace of God King of Kongo, of Loango, of Kakongo and of Ngoyo, on this side of the Zaire and beyond it, Lord of the Ambundu and of Angola, of Aquisima, of Musuru, of Matamba, of Malilu, of Musuko and Anzizo, of the conquest of Pangu-Alumbu, etc&quot;.

==Kandas, Gerações and Houses==
The kingdom of Kongo had a formal state apparatus, in which most positions (&quot;rendas&quot; in Portuguese-language documents, meaning income bearing positions) were in the hands of the king, and the king himself was elected by powerful officials. Kings sought and held office with the assistance of a kanda. Each kanda (plural: &quot;makanda&quot;) was a faction which organized people according to a common goal, often but not always rooted in a kin-based relationship. Kandas generally took the name of a person (i.e. Nimi, Nlaza or Mpanzu), but could also take the name of a location or title such as Mbala (court)) or birthplace (Kwilu or Nsundi). The Kikongo prefix &quot;ki&quot; is added onto these names to mean &quot;people with something in common&quot;. These factions were recorded as &quot;gerações&quot; or &quot;casas&quot; (lineages or houses) in Kongo documents written in Portuguese. Until the mid-seventeenth century, following the Battle of Mbwila, these factions were short-lived and fluctuating, but following the battle, factions were much firmer and lasted for generations, particularly the Kimpanzu and Kinlaza. The Quilombo dos Palmares, a Maroon kingdom formed in Northeast Brazil, was founded by princes and nobles who were enslaved and transported to Portuguese Brazil after the battle in Kongo. There, they retained their titles and their lineage survived even after the kingdom itself was destroyed.

==Dynasties==
When the Portuguese arrived in Kongo in 1483, the reigning king represented the Nimi kanda. This kanda was probably descended from Nimi a Nzima, father of the founder of Kongo. Divisions emerged within the kanda during succession disputes, for example, following the death of Afonso I in 1542, his son Pedro I and grandson Diogo I formed two opposed factions, that of Pedro was called the Kibala (court) faction, and the other, whose name is unknown that followed Diogo. Other elections in the sixteenth century probably also involved similar factions, though the details are unknown. 

King Álvaro I was the first king of the House of Kwilu (Portuguese: &quot;Coulo&quot;). This kanda or lineage was named for the birthplace of Álvaro, north of the capital city. The Kwilu reigned until 1614 when Antonio da Silva, Duke of Mbamba intervened to place Bernardo I on the throne, in place of Álvaro II&#x27;s minor son, who would eventually take office as Álvaro III. 

Another kanda, the House of Nsundi, later known as the Kinkanga a Mvika, took control of Kongo in 1622 under Pedro II, and retained it through the reign of his son, Garcia I. Garcia never held power strongly, and the Kimpanzu returned to power under Ambrosio I. Kimpanzu domination ended in 1641 when two brothers Álvaro and Garcia of the new House of Kinlaza overthrew Álvaro V and took power. The members of the Kikanga a Mvika were all killed or absorbed into the Kinlaza by 1657. The Kinlaza dynasty would reign until Kongo&#x27;s catastrophic civil war following the 1665 Battle of Mbwila, when sporadic and violent alternation followed.

The capital was destroyed in 1678. Its destruction forced the claimants from both sides of the conflict to rule from mountain fortresses. The Kinlaza retreated to Mbula where they founded the capital of Lemba. Earlier another branch of Kinlaza, under the leadership of Garcia III of Kongo founded a settlement at Kibangu. The Kimpanzu based their struggle for the throne at Mbamba Luvota in the south of Soyo. A new faction appeared in the form of the Água Rosada kanda, headquartered at the mountain fortress of Kibangu. This might be considered a new house formed from both the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu, its founders were the children of a Kimpanzu father and a Kinlaza mother. All parties claimed kingship over Kongo (or what was left of it), but their power rarely held beyond their fortresses or the immediately surrounding area.

The country was finally reunited by Pedro IV of the Água Rosada kanda. Pedro IV declared a doctrine of shared power by which the throne would shift (in due time) from Kinlaza to the Kimpanzu and back., while the Água Rosada appear to have continued as neutral in Pedro&#x27;s fortress of Kibangu.

The system functioned sporadically, with considerable fighting, until 1764 when José I of the Kinlaza faction usurped the throne and thrust the country back into civil war. The Kinlaza enjoyed a short-lived second dynasty that ended in 1788. After that, the throne moved through various royal hands until the kingship was extinguished in 1914.

==Elections==
The selection of kings of Kongo was by a variety of principles, as kings themselves evoked different methods of selection in their letters announcing their succession. Typically the kingdom was said to pass by election, though the electors and the process they used changed over time and according to circumstances. Frequently election seems to have been a combination of elective and hereditary principles.

==Kings of Kongo==
The following section is divided into periods based on kanda or house rulership. Most houses reigned of a distinct period with few if any intervals. This is not the case, however; after the Kongo Civil War. During this period you will note the name of each king&#x27;s kanda alongside their reign.

===Pre-colonial rulers===
====Ancestors of later rulers====
According to oral tradition, the first king was the son of chief Nimi and his consort of unknown name, Mwene Mbata&#x27;s daughter. Most of the succeeding dynasties either claim descent from this union or otherwise derive their legitimacy from it.

===Brazilian branch of Palmares===
The Quilombo dos Palmares was a Maroon Kingdom formed in the Captaincy of Pernambuco in what is now Northeast Brazil sometime around 1605 by princes and nobles from the Kingdom of Kongo. They had been captured during the Battle of Mbwila, and were subsequently transported there as slaves. After escaping slavery, they resumed use of their royal and noble titles. The members of this branch probably belonged to the House of Awenekongo of the Nlaza kanda of Antonio I.

* Camuanga, King (ruled 1695–?). A son of Zumbi and the last known member of the lineage in the Americas.

==Further reading==
This list is constructed primarily from that found in Graziano Saccardo, &quot;&#x27;Congo e Angola con la storia dell&#x27;antica missione dei cappuccini&quot; (3 vols, Milan, 1982–83), vol. 3, pp. 11–14. Saccardo bases his reconstruction on several king lists produced over time, by António da Silva, Duke of Mbamba in 1617, by António de Teruel in 1664, by Pedro Mendes in 1710 and by Francisco das Necessidades in 1844. In addition, many of the kings wrote letters and signed them with both their names and their numbers, and Saccardo has found many of these to verify the kinglists.

Saccardo&#x27;s king list has been modified in the following manner: the Kikongo names of the kings have been given in a Kikongo form following norms established in Joseph de Munck, &quot;Kinkulu kia Nsi eto&quot;&#x27; (Tumba, 1956, 2nd ed, Matadi, 1971). The Christian names of the kings are given in modern Portuguese spelling. In addition, Saccardo&#x27;s entries have been updated by a number of sources, most notably the king list, unknown to him found in the Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro (Rio de Janeiro) Manuscritos, Lata 6, pasta 2. &quot;Catallogo dos reis de Congo&quot; MS of c. 1758.

<doc id="857669" wikidata="Q7825775" url="?curid=857669" title="Tori shogi">
<text>Tori shōgi (禽将棋 or 鳥将棋, &#x27;bird chess&#x27;) is a variant of shogi (Japanese chess), which was invented by Toyota Genryu in 1799 despite being traditionally attributed to his master Ōhashi Sōei. It was first published in 1828 and again in 1833. The game is played on a 7×7 board and uses the drop rule; it is the only traditional shogi variant, possibly besides wa shogi, to do so. This is one of the more popular shogi variants. There were tournaments in London and Royston in the 1990s and early 2000s.

==Rules of the game==

===Objective===

The objective of the game is to capture your opponent&#x27;s phoenix.

===Game equipment===

Two players, Black and White (or 先手 &quot;sente&quot; and 後手 &quot;gote),&quot; play on a board ruled into a grid of 7 &quot;ranks&quot; (rows) by 7 &quot;files&quot; (columns). The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color.

Each player has a set of 16 wedge-shaped pieces, of slightly different sizes. From largest to smallest (or most to least powerful) they are:

* 1 phoenix
* 1 falcon
* 2 cranes
* 2 pheasants
* 2 quails (a left and a right)
* 8 swallows

In line with the bird theme, each piece is named after a different kind of bird.

Each piece has its name in the form of a kanji written on its face. On the reverse side of some pieces is another character, often in a different color (commonly red instead of black) and are usually cursive; this reverse side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. (The quail are different: on one side is the character for &quot;quail&quot;, while on the other is the character for left or right; some people will play with the &quot;left&quot;/&quot;right&quot; side up instead of the &quot;quail&quot; side up.)

The pieces of the two sides do not differ in color, but instead each piece is shaped like a wedge, and faces forward, toward the opposing side. This shows who controls the piece during play.

====Table of pieces====

Listed here are the pieces of the game in English and Japanese:

The first pronunciation of each piece is the Japanese pronunciation, while the second is the Sino-Japanese pronunciation. The promoted pieces (*) are usually called &quot;eagle&quot; and &quot;goose&quot; in English.

===Setup===

Below is a diagram showing the setup of the pieces. Black pieces are in bold face in the first diagram, and bigger in the second, and move first:

&lt;br&gt;
===Gameplay===

The players alternate making a move, with Black moving first. (The traditional terms &#x27;black&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27; are used to differentiate the sides during discussion of the game, but are no longer literally descriptive.) A move consists of moving a single piece on the board and potentially &quot;promoting&quot; that piece, displacing &quot;(capturing)&quot; an opposing piece or &quot;dropping&quot; a captured piece onto an empty square of the board. Each of these options is detailed below.

===Movement and capture===

An opposing piece is captured by &quot;displacement:&quot; That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece (meaning another piece controlled by the moving player).

Each piece on the game moves in a characteristic pattern. Pieces move either &quot;orthogonally&quot; (that is, forward, backward, left, or right, in the direction of one of the arms of a plus sign, +), or &quot;diagonally&quot; (in the direction of one of the arms of a multiplication sign, ×).

Many pieces are capable of several kinds of movement, with the type of movement most often depending on the direction in which they move. The movement categories are:

====Step movers====
Some pieces move only one square at a time. (If a friendly piece occupies an adjacent square, the moving piece may not move in that direction; if an opposing piece is there, it may be displaced and captured.)

The step movers are the phoenix, falcon, crane, and the 8 swallows on each side.

====Limited ranging piece====

The eagle can move along a limited number (2) of free (empty) squares along a straight line in certain directions. Other than the limited distance, it moves like ranging pieces (see below).

====Jumping pieces====

The pheasant and goose can &quot;jump,&quot; that is, they can pass over any intervening piece, whether friend or foe, with no effect on either.

====Ranging pieces====

The quail and eagle can move any number of empty squares along a straight line, limited only by the edge of the board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass a piece that is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.

===Promotion===

A player&#x27;s &quot;promotion zone&quot; consists of the two farthest ranks, at the original line of the opponent&#x27;s falcon and beyond. If a piece &quot;crosses&quot; the board within the promotion zone, including moves into, out of, or wholly within the zone, but &quot;not&quot; including drops (see below), then that player must &quot;promote&quot; the piece at the end of the turn. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank.

Promoting a piece has the effect of changing how that piece moves until it is removed from the board (see above). Only two pieces promote, as follows:

* A falcon promotes to an eagle.
* A swallow promotes to a goose.

When captured, pieces lose their promoted status.

===Individual pieces===

Below are diagrams indicating each piece&#x27;s movement. Pieces with a grey heading start out in the game; those with a blue heading only appear on the board after promotion. Betza&#x27;s funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference.


===Drops===

Captured pieces are truly &quot;captured&quot; in tori shogi. They are retained &quot;in hand&quot;, and can be brought back into play under the capturing player&#x27;s control. On any turn, instead of moving a piece across the board, a player can take a piece he has previously captured and place it on any empty square, facing the opponent. The piece is now part of the forces controlled by that player. This is termed &quot;dropping&quot; the piece, or just a &quot;drop&quot;.

A drop cannot capture a piece; that requires an additional move.

Pieces that are dropped in the promotion zone do not promote as a result: Promotion requires that piece make a normal movement on a subsequent turn, as detailed under &quot;Promotion&quot;, above. Pieces that are promoted when captured lose that promotion; they are unpromoted when dropped back on the board.

There are three restrictions when dropping swallows:

A swallow may not be dropped on the furthest rank, since it would have no legal move on subsequent turns.

A swallow cannot be dropped into the same file (vertical column) as two other unpromoted swallows controlled by the same player. (A &quot;goose,&quot; or promoted swallow, does not count as a swallow when considering this drop restriction.)

A swallow cannot be dropped where the opponent would have no way to prevent his phoenix being captured on the next move. In other words, a swallow cannot be dropped to give immediate checkmate.

===Check and mate===

When a player makes a move such that the opponent&#x27;s phoenix could be captured on the following move, the move is said to &quot;give check&quot; to the phoenix; the phoenix is said to be &quot;in check&quot;. If a player&#x27;s phoenix is in check and no legal move by that player will get the phoenix out of check, the checking move is also &quot;mate,&quot; and effectively wins the game.

A player is not allowed to give perpetual check. This is not a rule in itself, but arises from the repetition rule. Either the checker has to break off the checking, or the checked side has to stop evading, after which his phoenix is captured.

===Repetition===

The rule for repetition (千日手 &quot;sennichite)&quot; in tori shogi is that if the same position occurs three times with the same player to play by repetition of moves, the player starting the sequence &quot;must&quot; vary the move. For two positions to be considered the same, the pieces in hand must be the same, as well as the position on the board.

===Game end===

A player who captures the opponent&#x27;s phoenix wins the game. In practice this rarely happens, as a player will resign when checkmated, as otherwise when loss is inevitable.

A player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games.)

==Handicaps==

Games between players of disparate strength are often played with handicaps. In a handicap game, one or more of White&#x27;s pieces is removed before the start of play, and White plays the first move of the game. Note that the pieces removed at the beginning play no further part in the game—they are not available for drops. The imbalance created by this method of handicapping is not as strong as it is in chess, because material advantage is not as powerful in tori shogi as in chess.

Common handicaps, in increasing order of size, are as follows:
*Remove White&#x27;s left quail
*Remove White&#x27;s falcon
*Two pieces: remove White&#x27;s falcon and left quail
*Three pieces: remove White&#x27;s falcon and both quails

Other handicaps are also occasionally used. The relationship between handicaps and differences in rank is not universally agreed upon.

==Game notation==

The method used in English-language texts to express shogi moves was established by George Hodges in 1976. It is derived from the algebraic notation used for chess, but differs in several respects. Modifications have been made for tori shogi.

A typical example is Sw-6d.
The first letter represents the piece moved: Sw = swallow, Q = quail, Pt = pheasant, Cr = crane, Fa = falcon, Ph = phoenix.
Promoted pieces have a + added in front of the letter, as +Sw for a goose (promoted swallow).
The designation of the piece is followed by a symbol indicating the type of move: - for an ordinary move, x for a capture, or * for a drop.
Next is the designation for the square on which the piece lands.
This consists of a number representing the file and a lowercase letter representing the rank, with 1a being the top right corner (as seen from Black&#x27;s point of view) and 7g being the bottom left corner.
(This method of designating squares is based on Japanese convention, which, however, uses Japanese numerals instead of letters. For example, the square 2c is denoted by 2三 in Japanese.)

If a move requires the player to promote the piece, then a + is added to the end to signify that the promotion was taken. For example, SWx4a+ indicates a swallow capturing on 4a and promoting.

In cases where the above notation would be ambiguous, the designation of the start square is added after the designation for the piece in order to make clear which piece is meant. For example, if Black has a crane at both 3c and 5c, which can be moved to the square 4b in front of the phoenix, then these are distinguished as Cr5c-4b (moving the left one) and Cr3c-4b (moving the right one). Optionally, a prefix may be added to the quail to distinguish the left quail from the right quail, LQ and RQ, when the left quail appears to the right of the right quail.

Moves are commonly numbered as in chess. For example, the start of a game might look like this:
In handicap games White plays first, so Black&#x27;s move 1 is replaced by an ellipsis.

<doc id="857674" wikidata="Q1004079" url="?curid=857674" title="From Her to Eternity">
<text>From Her to Eternity is the debut studio album by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released in May 1984 by Mute Records. Produced by Flood and the band itself, the album&#x27;s title is a pun on James Jones&#x27; debut novel, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1951), and its subsequent 1953 film adaptation.

== Background and production ==
After the break-up of Nick Cave&#x27;s former band the Birthday Party, Cave formed a new project with former band member Mick Harvey. Cave and Harvey were joined by a semi-fluid group of bandmates, initially including Einstürzende Neubauten member Blixa Bargeld on guitar, Hugo Race on guitar, and former Magazine member Barry Adamson on guitar, bass, and piano. After some studio work, the band&#x27;s premiere public performance was held on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1983 at the Crystal Ballroom in Melbourne, under the name &quot;Nick Cave – Man or Myth?&quot;, followed by a tour. The band then briefly called themselves &quot;Nick Cave and the Cavemen&quot; before adopting the &quot;Bad Seeds&quot; moniker, in reference to the final Birthday Party release, &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; extended play (EP).

The majority of the album was recorded at Trident Studios in London in March 1984. &quot;Saint Huck&quot;, &quot;Wings off Flies&quot; and &quot;A Box for Black Paul&quot; were recorded at The Garden studio (owned by John Foxx of Ultravox) between September and October 1983. JG Thirlwell, an early member of the group, co-wrote &quot;Wings Off Flies&quot; and made uncredited instrumental contributions to the album, but departed early in the recording sessions due to creative disagreements and to work on his own solo material. The band is also seen playing a live performance of the title track in the 1987 Wim Wenders film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;. This version, recorded at Hansa Studio, Berlin in February 1987, is included on CD reissues of the album.

Cave later said, &quot;Well, I guess we weren&#x27;t kicking people in the teeth anymore. I mean, it just became different. I wanted it to be more lyrically orientated and getting Blixa Bargeld from Einstürzende Neubauten in the group made an incredible difference. He&#x27;s a completely kind of atmospheric guitarist and incredibly economical and it gave me room to breathe.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

&quot;From Her to Eternity&quot; has been well received by critics. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that while &quot;the album relies less on shock effects than any the Birthday Party ever made, the explosive parts are that much more effective.&quot; Chris Long of BBC Music described it as &quot;imperfect, visceral, exciting and, ultimately, classic.&quot;

Mat Snow said it was, &quot;one of the greatest rock albums ever made. Dynamic, subtly layered, funny and plain obsessive, &quot;From Her To Eternity&quot; is the work of a visionary unfettered by worship of the romantic rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll mythology, and which thus reaches peaks hitherto unscaled.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it 63rd on their list &quot;The 200 Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;, calling it &quot;ghoulish to the point of ridiculousness, which is the entire point [...their] visceral hyperbole is something powerful, as though we’re hearing humankind’s palm read by a fortune teller with a cockeyed grin and a hand snatching your wallet.&quot;

== 2009 remaster ==
The album was remastered and reissued on 27 April 2009 as a collector&#x27;s edition CD/DVD set, along with the three subsequent studio albums in the Bad Seeds catalog, namely &quot;The Firstborn Is Dead&quot; (1985), &quot;Kicking Against the Pricks&quot; and &quot;Your Funeral... My Trial&quot; (both 1986). The CD features the original 7-song vinyl LP&#x27;s track listing, while &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, &quot;The Moon Is in the Gutter&quot;, and &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot; (1987 version) are featured as bonus audio tracks on the accompanying DVD, rather than being sequenced into the album as in earlier CD pressings. The DVD also includes music videos from the time and the first installment of &#x27;Do You Love Me Like I Love You&#x27;, a 14-part documentary by Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard.

<text>Dixie Lee Junction is an unincorporated community in Loudon County, Tennessee, United States, situated at the intersection of U.S. Route 70 (US 70) and U.S. Route 11 (US 11). The community is named for its historical location at the junction of the eastern leg of the Dixie Highway (which followed US 70 through the region) and the Lee Highway (which followed US 11). From the advent of automobile travel in the late 1920s until the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s and 1960s, these two highways were major cross-country routes, and Dixie Lee Junction developed as a &quot;last chance&quot; stopover for tourists traveling southward from Knoxville. While the completion of the interstates drew away most of the cross-country traffic, the US 70/US 11 intersection still serves a strategic role as the western end of the four-lane Kingston Pike, a major commercial thoroughfare in western Knox County.

The Dixie Lee Junction community lies adjacent to the town of Farragut, with the Knox-Loudon county line (which runs perpendicular to Kingston Pike) being the technical boundary between the two communities. US 70 approaches Dixie Lee Junction from Kingston to the west, and US 11 approaches from Lenoir City to the southwest. The merged highways then continue eastward for through Farragut and Knoxville. Two major interstate highways, Interstate 40 (I-40) and I-75, merge just northwest of Dixie Lee Junction.

The Dixie Highway was conceived in 1914 to provide a convenient route from the Midwestern United States to Florida. Its eastern section entered downtown Knoxville via Broadway before veering westward along Cumberland Avenue and out into West Knoxville along Kingston Pike. The Lee Highway, which connected New York and San Francisco, entered Knoxville from Bean Station to the northeast, and merged with the Dixie Highway in downtown Knoxville.

Knoxville lay along the Dixie Highway roughly halfway between the Midwestern states and Florida, and thus made a convenient place for Florida-bound tourists to stop for the night. Throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, Kingston Pike was lined with motor courts and motels, and restaurants with oddly-shaped buildings and flashy signs designed to catch the attention of passers-by. Businesses in Dixie Lee Junction during this period consisted of &quot;last-chance&quot; ventures that provided food, fuel, and other supplies before south-bound drivers entered a predominantly-rural stretch of the highway en route to Chattanooga.

==Arts and culture==

Ronnie James Dio&#x27;s band Elf released a song &quot;Dixie Lee Junction&quot; about the community on their 1972 album Elf.

<text>The Manitoba Labour Party (MLP) was a reformist, non-Marxist labour party in Manitoba, Canada. It was created in early May 1910 as a successor to the province&#x27;s second Independent Labour Party (1906–08). Former Member of Parliament Arthur Puttee was a leading MLP organizer. The party fielded one candidate in the 1910 provincial election, and also ran candidates at the municipal level.

The party&#x27;s founding convention declared that &quot;the ultimate object of attainment shall be to preserve to the worker the full product of his toil&quot;. The ambiguity of this statement was criticized by the more radical Socialist Party of Canada (SPC), which called for collective ownership in industry.

After the SPC nominated candidates for Winnipeg North and Winnipeg West in the 1910 provincial election, the MLP sought to prevent confrontation and vote-splitting by fielding only one candidate of their own: Fred Dixon in Winnipeg Centre. Dixon was a moderate reformer, and campaigned in an unofficial alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party. He was bitterly opposed by the SPC, which belatedly nominated W.S. Cummings to run against him as a spoiler.

Dixon lost to the Conservative Party incumbent, Thomas Taylor, by seventy-three votes. Cummings&#x27;s ninety-nine votes may have made the difference in the outcome. The SPC was widely blamed for Dixon&#x27;s loss, and became marginalized in Winnipeg&#x27;s labour community for the next eight years.

The Manitoba Labour Party dissolved after the 1910 election. In 1912, its leaders formed the Manitoba Labour Representation Committee.

<doc id="857686" wikidata="Q592070" url="?curid=857686" title="The Firstborn Is Dead">
<text>The Firstborn Is Dead is the second studio album by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 3 June 1985 by Mute Records. Produced by the band and Flood, the album saw lead vocalist Nick Cave continue his fascination with the Southern United States, featuring references to Elvis Presley and bluesmen like Blind Lemon Jefferson. The album was recorded in the Hansa Studios in Berlin, Germany. Cave later said of the album, &quot;Berlin gave us the freedom and encouragement to do whatever we wanted. We&#x27;d lived in London for three years and it seemed that if you stuck your head out of the box, people were pretty quick to knock it back in. Particularly if you were Australian. When we came to Berlin it was the opposite. People saw us as some kind of force rather than a kind of whacky novelty act.&quot;

The album&#x27;s name is a reference to Jesse Garon Presley, the stillborn identical twin of Elvis Presley. The cover art photography was taken by Jutta Henglein-Bildau.

The album was remastered and reissued on 27 April 2009 as a collector&#x27;s edition CD/DVD set. The CD features the original 7-song vinyl LP&#x27;s track listing, while &quot;The Six Strings That Drew Blood&quot; is featured as a bonus audio track on the accompanying DVD.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Spin&quot; wrote, &quot;Mournfully authentic blue lines of harmonica and guitar, journeys through a mythical southern reality heavy on train wrecks, suicides, prison life, and big black crows. Cave&#x27;s concept of America has been peeled from the grooves of old blues and Western cowboy 78s.&quot;

== Track listing ==
=== Song details ===
* &quot;Tupelo&quot; is loosely based on the John Lee Hooker song &quot;Tupelo Blues&quot;, which is about a flood in Tupelo, Mississippi (Hooker&#x27;s song appears on &quot;Original Seeds&quot;). Tupelo is the birthplace of Elvis Presley. Cave&#x27;s song incorporates imagery of the birth of Elvis Presley and the apocalypse at the Second Coming of Christ. However, the &quot;Looky, Looky Yonder&quot; motif that features in the song is derived from a song of the same name recorded by Lead Belly, usually found as part of a medley which Cave himself covered under the title &quot;Black Betty&quot; on his third studio album, &quot;Kicking Against the Pricks&quot; (1986).
* &quot;Wanted Man&quot; evolved from a song composed by Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. Cave was granted permission to alter the lyrics. Cave&#x27;s lyrics include references to his friends, such as photographer Polly Borland.
* &quot;The Six Strings that Drew Blood&quot; is included on the 1988 CD reissue of the album, but not on the original LP. It was the B-side of the &quot;Tupelo&quot; single and is a remake of a song Cave originally recorded with the Birthday Party during the &quot;Mutiny&quot; sessions in 1982.

<doc id="857691" wikidata="Q29177" url="?curid=857691" title="Field Spaniel">
<text>The Field Spaniel is a medium-sized dog breed of spaniel type. They were originally developed to be all-black show dogs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for work as a hunting dog. However, during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable to be used for field work. They are now considered to be a rare breed, and are registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.

Their fur is darker than other spaniels and they have no undercoat like most of the other field type spaniels.

==History==

The Field Spaniel was originally developed for the show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel. Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; one of the first breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; &quot;Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have been hurled at me and my dogs from behind the hedge. But where is the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one (if there ever was one!) has not been forthcoming. Like most sporting dogs, they are the result of different crosses.&quot;

They were unpopular with sportsmen as the dark colours of the breed did not show up in hunting conditions, and the elongated and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover. The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s, Burdett was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in a dog that was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel with the exception of the head itself.

The dog considered to be the common ancestor of the modern English Cocker Spaniel is Ch. Obo, born in 1879 to a Sussex Spaniel father and a Field Spaniel mother. Obo&#x27;s son Ch. Obo II is considered to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel, being described as only 10 inches high with quite a long body.

By 1909, the average weight of a Field Spaniel was . Further mixing of the breed occurred with elements of the Basset Hound introduced. Various genetic health issues arose and action was taken in order to correct the problems within the breed. English Springer Spaniels were used to introduce healthier elements into the breed and resulted in the longer legged spaniel known today. Most of the modern breed can be traced to four dogs from the 1950s; Colombina of Teffont, Elmbury Morwena of Rhiwlas, Gormac Teal, and Ronayne Regal.

The Field Spaniel remains a rare breed, even in the UK. In 2009, a total of 51 dogs were registered with The Kennel Club and it has been in steady decline since 2000. Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club, the Field Spaniel has the lowest number registered year on year, with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009. This may be compared with the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700 registrations and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone. In order to promote the breed, it has been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.

==Description==

===Appearance===

The standard size for a Field Spaniel is approximately tall at the withers, and a weight of between . This places it roughly between the English Cocker Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel in size. Its coat comes in solid colours of black and liver, or in roan. Tan points, white markings on the throat and the chest can be ticked or the same colour as the rest of the body.

They have a moderately long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of the fur appears on the chest, belly, ears and on the back of the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but requires grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docking of tails has been banned in a number of countries, including the UK; however, an exemption is made for working animals.

===Temperament===

The Field Spaniel is an active and inquisitive breed, and makes a good companion. However, if left alone and unoccupied for long periods of time, they may become bored and destructive. They are suitable for dog agility exercises and hunting. They are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot; lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.
There are a few ocular conditions to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition. These include cataracts, retinal atrophy and retinal dysplasia. Hip dysplasia has appeared in British lines of Field Spaniels. The Kennel Club and British Veterinary Association highly recommend eye testing and hip scoring be carried out by Field Spaniel breeders. In a health survey conducted by the Kennel Club (UK), the primary cause of death in Field Spaniels was cancer, with the second most frequent cause being old age.

<doc id="857702" wikidata="Q2290182" url="?curid=857702" title="Black Tape for a Blue Girl">
<text>Black Tape for a Blue Girl (often stylized as black tape for a blue girl) is an American neoclassical dark wave band formed in 1986 by keyboardist/songwriter Sam Rosenthal, the founder of Projekt Records. The band&#x27;s fans include director David Lynch, Sasha Grey, Poppy Z. Brite, and Caitlín R. Kiernan.

Their music has elements of dark wave, ethereal, ambient, neoclassical, and dark cabaret music. Their 13th album, &quot;The Cleft Serpent&quot;, was released on October 1, 2021 on Projekt Records.

==Biography==
===Formation/Oscar Herrera era (1986-1999)===
Inspired by acts such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Tangerine Dream and Brian Eno, Projekt Records founder Sam Rosenthal established the California-based Black Tape for a Blue Girl as a vehicle for his electronic music compositions. Rosenthal served as songwriter, lyricist and producer for the band, who released their debut album &quot;The Rope&quot; in 1986. Along with Rosenthal, the band&#x27;s line-up included Allan Kraut (on multiple instruments, including drums and guitars) and vocalist and guitarist Oscar Herrera. Guests included Kim Prior (as vocals), Adam Buhler (on guitar), Candy Sherlock and Lara Radford (as violinists).

Their second album, &quot;Mesmerized by the Sirens&quot;, was released a year later, followed by &quot;Ashes in the Brittle Air&quot; in 1989, &quot;A Chaos of Desire&quot; in 1991 and &quot;This Lush Garden Within&quot; in 1993. The core members through this period were Rosenthal and Herrera, with a variety of guest musicians. Julianna Towns, of the band Skinner Box, provided vocals, flute, and guitar on &quot;Chaos&quot;.

Recording of &quot;Remnants of a Deeper Purity&quot; began in 1995 in Los Angeles and was concluded in 1996 after Rosenthal&#x27;s move to Chicago. This was the second album to feature Lucian Casselman on vocals and Vicki Richards on violin. It also featured Mera Roberts on cello. &quot;Remnants&quot; went on to become Black Tape for a Blue Girl&#x27;s best selling release, and was the basis for the band&#x27;s first live performance, Tuesday June 25, 1996 at Projektfest&#x27;96 in Chicago.

In 1999, the band released &quot;As One Aflame Laid Bare by Desire&quot;, with Oscar Herrera singing two songs on the album as a parting favor to Rosenthal. The album owes some artistic inspiration to Marcel Duchamp. Towns returned for female vocals and also provided guitar arrangements. After a 15 city tour in July 1998 in preparation for the album&#x27;s release, she was ejected from the band. Elysabeth Grant joined the band as violist, but she soon became the lead vocalist during a 14 city tour in February 1999, which also featured Lisa Feuer on flute and backing vocals.

===Elysabeth Grant era (1999-2008)===
In late 1999, Rosenthal (and now ex-wife Feuer) moved to New York City. Recording began on the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Scavenger Bride&quot;, with Elysabeth Grant as lead vocalist and violist. Original vocalist Oscar Herrera was no longer involved with the band, giving up male vocal duties to Bret Helm (of Audra) and Athan Maroulis (of Spahn Ranch). &quot;The Scavenger Bride&quot; was released in 2002, with only two live appearances, as Rosenthal and Feuer&#x27;s son was born.

Two years later, the band released &quot;Halo Star&quot;, which shifted the vocal focus to Bret Helm. This album also marked a change in the band&#x27;s lush, ethereal sound. It is the band&#x27;s first journey into a dark cabaret musical style, very similar to the Dresden Dolls and Katzenjammer Kabarett. An 18 city West Coast and East Coast tour wan through September and October 2004, with the band lineup of Rosenthal, Helm, Grant, Nicki Jaine, and Jay.

Rosenthal and Jaine (vocals and guitar) spent 2005 recording and performing as Revue Noir.

Black Tape for a Blue Girl performed three shows in 2007 with the lineup of Rosenthal, Grant, Helm and Feuer.

===Athan Maroulis era (2009-2012)===
Athan Maroulis, who appeared on two songs on &quot;The Scavenger Bride&quot; album, as well as a cover of Dead Can Dance&#x27;s &quot;Fortune Presents Gifts Not According to the Book&quot;, took over as lead vocalist.

On September 22, 2009, the band released their 10th album, &quot;10 Neurotics&quot;, with the lineup of Rosenthal on acoustic guitar, programming and keyboards, Brian Viglione (The Dresden Dolls) on drums, percussion, bass and guitar, and vocalists Maroulis (Spahn Ranch), Laurie Reade (ex-Attrition) and Nicki Jaine on additional vocals. Sam explained that the risque nature of the Neurotics-material caused the previous band members to shy away from singing the songs, though Grant did appear on the song &quot;You Strike Me Down&quot;, previously released in a longer and more ethereal form on &quot;Projekt200&quot;.

In August 2009, the band was invited to play at a CD release party for Dreamchild&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Flowers Severed, Scream of Laughter&quot;. Wisteriax performed an opening cello piece, Black Tape for a Blue Girl performed a four-song set from &quot;10 Neurotics&quot;, and Dreamchild finished with a final set. The band played East Coast shows and festivals with Rosenthal, Maroulis, Jaine and occasionally Viglione (on guitar).

In October 2010, Valerie Gentile (The Crüxshadows) joined Black Tape for a Blue Girl as guitarist and vocalist, replacing Jaine, who retired from music at this point.

In October 2011, Pinky Weitzman (Not Waving But Drowning) replaced vocalist Valerie Gentile, who was living in Los Angeles. Maroulis, Rosenthal and Weitzman performed three shows together, including the 2011 Projektfest.

With Maroulis as vocalist, Black Tape For A Blue Girl played 31 shows between August 2009 and November 2011. In mid-2011, Rosenthal and Maroulis, with guest cellist Erica Mulkey / Unwoman, recorded a cover of the 1983 David Sylvian / Ryuichi Sakamoto track &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot; which appeared on the Projekt Holiday release &quot;Ornamental&quot;.

The band then entered a mostly dormant phase while Rosenthal wrote (in 2012) and promoted his erotic novel, &quot;Rye&quot;.

===Post-NYC era (2013-present)===
In August 2013, Rosenthal moved to Portland, Oregon. His endorsement of crowd-funding grew after the successful 2013 Kickstarter for the vinyl reissue of &quot;Remnants of a Deeper Purity&quot;. In the same year, they released &quot;Tenderotics&quot; - a reworking of the tracks from 2009&#x27;s &quot;10 Neurotics&quot;.

In January 2015, Rosenthal launched a Patreon page to support the recording of new music. In April 2015, the first result of this Patron support was &quot;As Lonely As Dave Bowman&#x27;s Monolith&quot; CD, a solo-electronic release from Rosenthal. In September 2015, a Kickstarter was created to fund a 12&quot; single with four new tracks, all sung by Michael Plaster of SoulWhirlingSomewhere.

Rosenthal wrote, &quot;The tracks on the EP are a bit of an anomaly from the others I am recording; these are sparse and sensitive acoustic guitar pieces with Michael&#x27;s vocals.&quot; At this time, he announced the name and stylistic change of the spring 2016 Black Tape For A Blue Girl album, &quot;These fleeting moments will be a return to the ethereal darkwave/dark ambient sound of the early 90s Blacktape CDs.&quot;

The band marked their 30th anniversary with the release of &quot;These Fleeting Moments&quot;, featuring the return of original vocalist Oscar Herrera after 17 years absence from the music scene.

The band&#x27;s have since released two further Kickstarter-funded albums, their 12th, &quot;To Touch the Milky Way&quot;, was released in 2018, followed by &quot;The Cleft Serpent&quot; in 2021.

==Style==
The style of Black Tape for a Blue Girl is often described as &quot;gothic&quot;, though their large catalog of music does not often conform with general standards of gothic or darkwave music. Rather, it could be described as a soundscape of analog synth and old world instruments (both real and synthesized) mixed with ethereal male and female vocals in the vein of contemporaries Dead Can Dance. The lyric writing is done by Rosenthal and often explores powerful emotions of love, vulnerability, isolation, loss, jealousy, and passion.

==Notable past members==
Past members include Elysabeth Grant (also of Rachael&#x27;s Surrender) on vocals and violin, Bret Helm (of Audra) on vocals, acoustic guitar and bass, Lisa Feuer on flute and vocals and Michael Laird (of Unto Ashes) on acoustic guitar, percussion and vocals. A notable former member is the long-time vocalist Oscar Herrera (of the 1980s Florida-based The Sleep of Reason), who performed on the band&#x27;s first seven albums and their 11th album, &quot;These Fleeting Moments&quot;.

<doc id="857703" wikidata="Q1089177" url="?curid=857703" title="Kicking Against the Pricks">
<text>Kicking Against the Pricks is the third studio album released by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. First released in 1986, the album is a collection of Cave&#x27;s interpretations of songs by other artists. The title is a reference to a biblical quote from the King James Version of the Christian Bible, Acts 26, verse 14.

The album marked the Bad Seeds debut of drummer Thomas Wydler, expanding the Bad Seeds line-up to Cave (vocals and keyboards), Wydler, bassist Barry Adamson, and guitarists Mick Harvey and Blixa Bargeld. 

Cave would later downplay the importance of the record, but said it helped the band develop musically:

Remarking on the song selection, Cave said:

The strings were arranged by Harvey and played by the Berliner Kaffeehausmusik Ensemble. &quot;The Hammer Song&quot; is not to be confused with the song of the same name from the Bad Seeds&#x27; sixth studio album &quot;The Good Son&quot; (1990).

Andrea &#x27;Enthal in &quot;Spin&quot; described the album as &#x27;[it] has moments, but overall it&#x27;s a dready, self-indulgent blob&#x27;.

The album was remastered and reissued on 27 April 2009 as a collector&#x27;s edition CD/DVD set. The CD features the original 12-song vinyl LP&#x27;s track listing, while &quot;Black Betty&quot; and &quot;Running Scared&quot; are featured as bonus audio tracks on the accompanying DVD.

Recordings of seven of these songs, performed by the original artists, were later issued on the &quot;Original Seeds&quot; compilation CDs.

== Track listing ==
=== Vinyl version ===
=== CD version ===
=== Track listing errors ===
Some of the songs were re-titled (possibly through error), and one was miscredited, as follows:1. &quot;Muddy Water&quot; by Phil Rosenthal. On the Cave LP the song is credited to John Bundrick, who wrote a song of the same title, recorded by the band Free. Previously recorded by the Seldom Scene, and Johnny Cash.
3. &quot;Sleeping Annaleah&quot; is the song &quot;Weeping Annaleah&quot;, previously recorded by Tom Jones.
6. &quot;The Singer&quot; is the song &quot;The Folk Singer&quot;, previously recorded by Tommy Roe, Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, and Burl Ives.
7. &quot;Black Betty&quot; is actually three songs recorded by Leadbelly as a medley: &quot;Looky Looky Yonder/Black Betty/Yellow Women&#x27;s Doorbells&quot;.
 12. &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; was not co-written by Frank Farian; this credit appears as a consequence of his creating an extra verse for Boney M.&#x27;s cover version of the song.
13. &quot;Jesus Met the Woman at the Well&quot; is credited as &quot;traditional, arranged the Alabama Singers&quot;. While this song was recorded by the Alabama Singers, it follows the arrangement of an earlier recording by the Pilgrim Travelers, which is credited as &quot;traditional, arranged J. W. Alexander&quot;.
