<text>A nanoshell, or rather a nanoshell plasmon, is a type of spherical nanoparticle consisting of a dielectric core which is covered by a thin metallic shell (usually gold). These nanoshells involve a quasiparticle called a plasmon which is a collective excitation or quantum plasma oscillation where the electrons simultaneously oscillate with respect to all the ions.

The simultaneous oscillation can be called plasmon hybridization where the tunability of the oscillation is associated with mixture of the inner and outer shell where they hybridize to give a lower energy or higher energy. This lower energy couples strongly to incident light, whereas the higher energy is an anti-bonding and weakly combines to incident light. The hybridization interaction is stronger for thinner shell layers, hence, the thickness of the shell and overall particle radius determines which wavelength of light it couples with. Nanoshells can be varied across a broad range of the light spectrum that spans the visible and near infrared regions. The interaction of light and nanoparticles affects the placement of charges which affects the coupling strength. Incident light polarized parallel to the substrate gives a s-polarization (Figure 1b), hence the charges are further from the substrate surface which gives a stronger interaction between the shell and core. Otherwise, a p-polarization is formed which gives a more strongly shifted plasmon energy causing a weaker interaction and coupling.

==Discovery==
The discovery of the nanoshell was made by Professor Naomi J. Halas and her team at Rice University in 2003. When she and her team discovered nanoshells, they weren&#x27;t initially sure what potential such nanoshells held. &quot;We said, &#x27;Gee, what could it be good for?&#x27;&quot; Halas told CNN. After many suggestions, cancer therapy came out of ongoing collaborations with bioengineers looking for different types of biomedical applications. &quot;One of our visions&quot;, Halas stated, &quot;no less than single visit diagnosis and treatment of cancer&quot;. In 2003 Halas was awarded for Best Discovery of 2003 by &quot;Nanotechnology Now&quot;.

==Production==
A state of the art method for synthesizing gold nanoshells is the use of the Microfluidic Composite Foams. This method has the potential to replace the standard lithographic method of synthesizing plasmonic nanoshells. The production process described below was an experiment performed by Suhanya Duraiswamy and Saif A. Khan of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in Singapore. Although this method was an experiment, it represents the future of nanoshells synthesis.

The materials required for the production of the nanoshells are the following; Tetraethyl orthosilicate, ammonium hydroxide, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 3-aminopropyl tris, hydrogentetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate, tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride, sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ethanol, Ultrapure water and glassware washed in aqua regia and rinsed thoroughly in water.)

The first step in synthesizing nanoshells in this method is by creating the device for the reaction to take place within. Microfluidic device patterns were fabricated onto silicon wafers by standard photolithography using negative photoresist SU-8 2050. Devices were subsequently molded in poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) using the soft lithography technique.(40) Briefly, PDMS was molded onto the SU-8 masters at 70 °C for 4 h, peeled, cut, and cleaned. Inlet and outlet holes (1/16-in. o.d.) were punched into the device. The microchannels were irreversibly bonded to a glass slide precoated with a thin layer of PDMS after a brief 35 s air plasma treatment. The microchannels have rectangular cross-section and are 300 μm wide, 155 μm deep, and 0.45 m long.

The actual production of the nanoparticles involves pumping &quot;silicone oil, a mixture of gold-seeded silica particles and gold-plating solution and reducing agent solution to the microfluidic device while nitrogen gas was delivered from a cylinder.&quot; The plating solution was then left to age, in a controlled environment, for longer than 24 hours. After the aging process, the fluid is collected from the Microfluidic Device and placed in a centrifuge. The resulting liquid has a layer of oil on the surface with a solution below that contains the nanoshells.

The reason this method is revolutionary is that the size and relative thickness of the gold nanoshell can be controlled by changing the amount of time the reaction is allowed to take place as well as the concentration of the plating solution. Thereby allowing researchers to tailor the particles to suit their given needs. Albeit for optics or cancer treatment.

==Cancer treatment==
Gold-shelled nanoparticles, which are spherical nanoparticles with silica and/or liposome cores and gold shells, are used in cancer therapy and bio-imaging enhancement.
Theranostic probes – capable of detection and treatment of cancer in a single treatment – are nanoparticles that have binding sites on their shell that allow them to attach to a desired location (typically cancerous cells) then can be imaged through dual modality imagery (an imaging strategy that uses x-rays and radionuclide imaging) and through near-infrared fluorescence. The reason gold nanoparticles are used is due to their vivid optical properties which are controlled by their size, geometry, and their surface plasmons. Gold nanoparticles (such as AuNPs) have the benefit of being biocompatible and the flexibility to have multiple different molecules, and fundamental materials, attached to their shell (almost anything that can normally be attached to gold can be attached to the gold nano-shell, which can be used in helping identifying and treating cancer). The treatment of cancer is possible only because of the scattering and absorption that occurs for plasmonics. Under scattering, the gold-plated nano-particles become visible to imaging processes that are tuned to the correct wavelength which is dependent upon the size and geometry of the particles. Under absorption, photothermal ablation occurs, which heats the nanoparticles and their immediate surroundings to temperatures capable of killing the cancer cells. This is accomplished with minimal damage to cells in the body due to the utilization of the &quot;water window&quot; (the spectral range between 800 and 1300 nm). As the human body is mostly water, this optimizes the light used versus the effects rendered.

These gold nanoshells are shuttled into tumors by the use of phagocytosis, where phagocytes engulf the nanoshells through the cell membrane to form an internal phagosome, or macrophage. After this it is shuttled into a cell and enzymes are usually used to metabolize it and shuttle it back out of the cell. These nanoshells are not metabolized so for them to be effective they just need to be within the tumor cells and photo-induced cell death (as described above) is used to terminate the tumor cells. This scheme is shown in Figure 2.
Nanoparticle-based therapeutics have been successfully delivered into tumors by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention effect, a property that permits nanoscale structures to be taken up passively into tumors without the assistance of antibodies.[4] Delivery of nanoshells into the important regions of tumors can be very difficult. This is where most nanoshells try to exploit the tumor&#x27;s natural recruitment of monocytes for delivery as seen in the above figure. This delivery system is called a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot;.

This process works so well since tumors are about ¾ macrophages and once monocytes are brought into the tumor, it differentiates into macrophages which would also be need to maintain the cargo nanoparticles. Once the nanoshells are at the necrotic center, near-infrared illumination is used to destroy the tumor associated macrophages.

Additionally, these nanoparticles can be made to release antisense DNA oligonucleotides when under photo-activation. These oligonucleotides are used in conjunction with the photo-thermal ablation treatments to perform gene-therapy. This is accomplished because nanoparticle complexes are delivered inside of cells then undergo light induced release of DNA from their surface. This will allow for the internal manipulation of a cell and provide a means for monitoring a group cells return to equilibrium.

Another example of nanoshell plasmonics in cancer treatment involves placing drugs inside of the nanoparticle and using it as a vehicle to deliver toxic drugs to cancerous sites only. This is accomplished by coating the outside of a nanoparticle with iron oxide (allowing for easy tracking with an MRI machine), then once the area of the tumor is coated with the drug-filled nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can be activated using resonant light waves to release the drug.

<text>Teknivals (a portmanteau of the words tekno and festival) are large free parties which take place for several days. They take place most often in Europe and are often illegal under various national or regional laws. They vary in size from dozens to thousands of people, depending on factors such as accessibility, reputation, weather, and law enforcement. The parties often take place in venues far away from residential areas such as squatted warehouses, empty military bases, beaches, forests or fields. The teknival phenomenon is a grassroots movement which has grown out of the rave, punk, reggae sound system and UK traveller scenes and spawned an entire subculture. Summer is the usual season for teknivals.

==History==

Teknivals are a larger scale version of free parties and emerged in the early 1990s, when acid house parties and travellers in Great Britain became the target of political repression, culminating in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Section 63 of the Act gave the police new powers to close down illegal parties.

Sound systems then started travelling to countries in Europe where laws were less restrictive and the authorities were uncertain how to stop the festivals. One of the most famous of these sound systems was Spiral Tribe, which was at the forefront of the free party movement in Europe. Other systems were called Bedlam, Circus Normal, Circus Warp and Vox Populi. Desert Storm sound system organised teknivals in France and Spain and brought raves to war-torn Sarajevo, Bosnia, in 1996. At one party the front-line was 10 kilometres away and they were asked to turn off their lights in case they attracted enemy fire.

While some teknivals are one-off events, most take place every year on or around the same date; the biggest, such as the ones in France or Czech Republic, can attract up to 100,000 visitors (2003, France). Just as the word &#x27;teknival&#x27; was formed by merging the words &#x27;tekno&#x27; and &#x27;festival&#x27;, teknivals in different countries are referred to by abbreviated names, such as the aforementioned Czechtek, Frenchtek (North France) and also Poltek (Poland), Slovtek (Slovakia), Southtek (South Germany), Bulgariatek (Bulgaria), Rotek (Romania) Helltek (Greece, Hellas in Greek), AlbaniaTek (Albania), Dutchtek (Netherlands), Easttek (East Germany), U-Tek (Ukraine), Northtek (Canada) and Occitek (Occitania, South France). NorthTek was held on Crown Land in Ontario.

==Features==
===Music===

Since a teknival can last a week or longer, many musical styles will be represented. The music which grew in tandem with teknivals was free tekno, which is characterised by heavy, repetitive kick drums and is normally about 180 bpm. The DJs and party goers are unconcerned by musical boundaries, so a lot of different, mostly electronic, music is played and performed. Most sound systems play styles such as acid techno, hardcore, frenchcore, electro, techno, jungle music, raggacore, skullstep, neurofunk, breakcore, schranz and speedcore. Instead of focusing on genre, the music can be characterised by being more underground than the music heard in clubs and at commercial parties, although some sound systems might specialise in a certain subgenre. The music is played by DJs playing vinyl records and Mp3 files on a computer. Livesets are also frequently played using a variety of equipment: keyboards, drum machines, guitar effects pedals, MIDI controller and computers. At early teknivals, sound systems would play until either no-one was left dancing or the diesel ran out in the generator.

===Subculture===

Anyone is welcome to enter the site, there is no ticket or fee. Normally any artist who turns up is encouraged to participate. Over the course of a few days, the site can grow into a village of sound systems, cafes, tents and vehicles. The teknival is often regarded as an example of what Hakim Bey has termed the Temporary Autonomous Zone, though in interviews Bey has professed that rave culture&#x27;s interest in technology remains problematic for the implementation of the TAZ. However this has not stopped various groups from claiming the teknival and rave culture in general as the implementation of the TAZ. French ravers reached out to José Bové to make a political alliance but were rebuffed.

At the teknival site one finds a mixed group of young people which may include students, tekno travellers, squatters and hippies, bonded together by their love for listening to free tekno &#x27;sous les etoiles&#x27; (translation: &#x27;under the stars&#x27;) - as an early flyer proclaimed. It is usually the perception that there is no &quot;coherent&quot; politics or philosophical stance represented by the teknival subculture, mainly due to the fact that emphasis is placed on individual freedom. Many young teknival goers are disillusioned with mainstream politics. Nevertheless, the parties themselves require complex collective organisation and, in order to be successful, a sustainable environment of community relations. In themselves such events can be seen as a political statement of self-organisation at a distance from the State. Clashes with the police have mobilised some people to action against laws which would prohibit self-organisation and gathering to enjoy teknivals. These clashes date back to the 1980s (when teknivals were arguably indistinguishable from UK Orbital raves, summer acid house parties, UK traveller gatherings, Stonehenge pagan events, early tribal gatherings, trance parties in Goa, India and the like) and have continued to be part of teknival life. In April 2006 there was a march followed by a small teknival in Strasbourg, France to protest against police repression generally and more specifically against the closure of Czechtek in 2005. During the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act in the UK, various large-scale protests took place during daylight and in public. The Reclaim the Streets and Carnivals Against Capital of the 1990s that led up to and beyond the Seattle WTO protests (and subsequent &quot;anti-globalization&quot; events) drew from teknival and rave organisation and culture, often involving many of the same organisers and cross-section of the population.

As occurs with many subcultures, a dress code has developed. This &#x27;underground look&#x27; involves dark, baggy clothing (often ex-military) and extreme haircuts, such as dyed hair, dreadlocks or a shaved head (or a combination of the above). Body piercings and tattoos are common. People often buy large vehicles second-hand such as decommissioned buses, coaches or trucks. The vehicles are often primarily homes, lived in permanently or for a few months while travelling. They are also used to transport sound equipment. The &quot;tekno traveller&quot; is generally known as a mix between a New Age traveller and a crust punk.

===Organization===
Sound systems gather on the site and play varied types of electronic music. Along with each sound system come friends and travellers so most teknivals have a multicultural atmosphere. The parties can last for several days or even weeks. Teknivals are organised by the sound system community using underground methods such as word of mouth, answerphone messages, flyer (pamphlet) and internet discussion boards. Normally the flyer states that the party is an open invitation, thus any artist who turns up can play music. The emphasis is on a DIY ethic. As well as local sound systems, who might act as the hosts, larger sound systems can spend the summer travelling from one teknival to the next before returning to their home country for the winter.

Despite public perceptions, drug deaths at parties are rare. Two people died at a teknival at Marigny-le-Grand in Marne in 2005, one from a cocktail of alcohol and drugs, the other from an allergic reaction to a caterpillar.

==Teknivals by region==
=== French teknivals ===

In France teknivals began in 1993. The May Day teknival at Fontainebleau near Paris was attracting 60-80,000 people by the late 1990s and in 2004 over 110,000 with over 200 sound systems. Eventual amendments to the public safety laws, the Loi sur la Securité Quotidienne, were passed in 2002 (known as the &quot;Mariani Law&quot; named after politician Thierry Mariani) in which free parties became linked with terrorism. Like the UK’s Criminal Justice Act, this effectively criminalized large free festivals and increased police powers to prevent these events. Legitimate teknivals, now dubbed &quot;Sarkovals&quot; after Nicolas Sarkozy (formerly the Minister of the Interior and President) would require permission from the Ministry. However, while regulatory interventions have inaugurated the institutionalization and commercialization of a scene rooted in an autonomous vibe, the parties continued. A legal party near Chambéry drew 80,000 ravers. Sound systems were occasionally seized at illegal parties, for example at Bouafles in 2009 and Saint-Martin-de-Crau in 2011.

Currently French law permits free parties with 500 people or under (subject to no noise complaints), and while Prefets generally refuse the applications now required for free parties with over 500 people, through constant negotiations with the Ministry of Interior since the August 2002 teknival on the French/Italian frontier at Col de l’Arches where sound crews set up rigs inside the Italian border facing the party goers in France, the French Government have reluctantly allowed up to three large teknivals each year, even though they are technically unauthorized events. Teknivals also take place outside legal festivals such as Printemps de Bourges, Transmusicales in Rennes or Borealis in Montpellier. Teknival negotiators deal directly with the Ministry of Interior, not the Ministry of Culture (with whom the commercial ventures seeking official status must deal) indicating that they are largely not cultural but security concerns.

In May 2019, unexpectedly cold weather affected a teknival attended by 10,000 people in the Creuse department in central France. Thirty people were treated for hypothermia as the temperature dropped to .

=== UK teknivals ===

In 2002, the tenth anniversary of the legendary Castlemorton rave was celebrated at Steart Beach, where around 16,000 people turned up over the course of the weekend. In 2005, there was a UK Tek in Wales and also a teknival known as Scumtek that happened twice in London. The first Scumtek was stopped by the police. However a further four events have taken place under the Scumtek name, three of which were squats with teknival rig numbers, and Scumtek 3 which took place in the centre of London Docklands in April 2010 outside and inside with 23 rigs in attendance.

2006 saw a teknival occur in Camelford, Cornwall at Davidstow abandoned airfield. Approximately 2,500 people attended and it was eventually clamped down on by the police three days after it began. UK Tek 2008 took place in a moorland quarry above Rochdale in north Manchester resulting in a significant police response, including attacking ravers with batons. Dog units, mounted police, and police in full riot gear attended. The UK Tek in 2009 took place on a remote hillside near Brecon, Wales at an abandoned pub called The Drovers Arms, that is used by the MOD as a training location. In 2010 UK Tek was at Dale Aerodrome in Pembrokeshire, Wales again with approximately 2,500 attendees and police forced most people off site by the Sunday. In 2015 it took place in Lincolnshire at an old airfield that had been used in the past for raves. Police closed down soundsystems one by one, until the remaining system had the majority of ravers around it, and resisted Police lines and forced them to back down. 2017 UK Tek took place in Wales near Sennybridge, Brecon.

In May 2018, a UK Tek was organised near to the Welsh town of Brechfa in Carmarthenshire. The rave started at midnight on Saturday with the music not finishing until late Monday evening. Approximately 4,000 people were in attendance. South Wales Police were aware of the rave, but did not have the resources available to disperse such a large crowd of people. A police helicopter was used throughout the bank holiday weekend to monitor the actions on the ground. Late on Tuesday evening, rave attendees were still seen at the location cleaning up the majority of litter left behind.

In April 2022, an Easter Teknival took place in East Lulworth, Dorset. News sources claim that over 1000 revellers were in attendance over the 21 hour duration of the party.

===Czech teknivals===
In the Czech Republic, Czechtek was held annually from 1994. In 2005, police and 5,000 party-goers clashed resulting in 30 injured ravers and 50 injured police officers. There is also Czarotek (held annually in spring). When Czechtek has been discontinued after the event at Hradiště Military Area in 2006, more smaller open free parties are held through all the year. Czech travellers like Circus Alien, Strahov or Vosa continued to spread the vibe to various countries across Europe such as Bulgaria (from 2003), Romania, Spain, Poland or Ukraine (from 2006).

=== Bulgarian teknivals ===
Bulgariatek began in 2003 and takes place annually in early August, usually somewhere on the Black Sea coast.

The first noise complaint occurred in 2017 in Shkoprilovtsi and made the local authorities surprisingly notice that a teknival had been taking place on the beach every year for the last ten years.

<text>Enguerrand de Marigny, Baron Le Portier (c. 126030 April 1315) was a French chamberlain and minister of Philip IV.

==Early life==
He was born at Lyons-la-Forêt in Normandy, of an old Norman family of the lesser baronage called Le Portier, which took the name of Marigny about 1200.

Enguerrand entered the service of Hugues II de Bouville, chamberlain and secretary of king Philip IV, as a squire, and then was attached to the household of Queen Jeanne, who made him one of the executors of her will. He married her god-daughter, Jeanne de St Martin. In 1298 he received the custody of the castle of Issoudun.

==Ministry==
After the death of Pierre Flotte at Courtrai in 1302 and de Bouville at the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle in 1304, he became Philip&#x27;s Grand Chamberlain and chief minister. In 1306 he was sent to preside over the exchequer of Normandy. He received numerous gifts of land and money from Philip as well as a pension from Edward II of England.
Possessed of an ingratiating manner, politic, learned and astute, he acted as an able instrument in carrying out Philip&#x27;s plans, and received corresponding confidence. He shared the popular odium which Philip incurred by debasing the coinage. He acted as the agent of Philip in his contest with Louis, Count of Nevers, the son of Robert III of Flanders, imprisoning Louis and forcing Robert to surrender Lille, Douai and Béthune.

He obtained for his half-brother Philip de Marigny in 1301 the bishopric of Cambrai, and in 1309 the archbishopric of Sens, and for his brother Jean in 1312 the bishopric of Beauvais. Still another relative, Nicolas de Frauville, became the king&#x27;s confessor and a cardinal. He addressed the Estates-General in 1314 and succeeded in getting further taxes for the Flemish war, incurring at the same time much ill will.
This soon came to a head when the princes of the blood, eager to fight the Flemings, were disappointed by his negotiating a peace in September. He was accused of receiving bribes, and Charles of Valois denounced him to the king himself; but Philip stood by him and the attack was of no avail. The death of Philip IV on 29 November 1314 was a signal for a reaction against his policy. The feudal party, whose power the king had tried to limit, turned on his ministers and chiefly on his chamberlain.

==Downfall==
Enguerrand was arrested by Louis X at the instigation of Charles of Valois, and twenty-eight articles of accusation including charges of receiving bribes were brought against him. He was refused a hearing; but his accounts were correct, and Louis was inclined to spare him anything more than banishment to the island of Cyprus. Charles then brought forward a charge of sorcery which was more effectual. He was condemned at once and hanged on the public gibbet of Montfaucon, protesting that in all his acts he had only been carrying out Philip&#x27;s commands (30 April 1315).

Marigny founded the collegiate church of Notre-Dame d&#x27;Écouis near Rouen in 1313. He was twice married, first to Jeanne de St Martin, by whom he had three children, Louis, Marie and Isabelle (who married Robert, son of Robert de Tancarville); and the second time to Alips de Mons.

==In fiction==
Marigny is a major character in &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of historical novels by Maurice Druon, which were adapted into a television miniseries in 1972 and again in 2005. He was portrayed by André Falcon in 1972 and by Jean-Claude Drouot in 2005.

Marigny is also referenced in the final chapter of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame as the first victim of Montfaucon, and a just man.

<doc id="871598" wikidata="Q3140484" url="?curid=871598" title="Bedford School">
<text>Bedford School is a 7–18 boys public school in the county town of Bedford in England. Founded in 1552, it is the oldest of four independent schools in Bedford run by the Harpur Trust. Bedford School is one of the oldest boys&#x27; schools in the United Kingdom, and was the winner of the Independent Boys School of the Year Award at the Independent Schools of the Year Awards in 2021.

Bedford School is composed of the Preparatory School (ages 7 to 13) and the Upper School (ages 13 to 18). There are around 1,100 pupils, of whom approximately one half are boarders. In 2014, James Hodgson succeeded John Moule as headmaster after Moule moved on to Radley College.

==History==
=== Background ===

Although no large scale educational institution had existed in Bedford before the foundation of Bedford School, the collegiate St Paul&#x27;s Church had run systems to teach Bedford&#x27;s youth Latin and church history since at least 1086. This was overseen by Bedford&#x27;s archdeacon, but this ceased when the church&#x27;s monks became canons regular, moving to Newnham Priory; until the priory&#x27;s dissolution in 1540, education in Bedford continued elsewhere in the town. This medieval school, located on &quot;Scolestreet&quot;, later Mill Lane, had ended by 1447.

=== Establishment and early years ===
On 15 August 1552, Edward VI issued letters patent in Ely allowing the &quot;Mayors, Bailiffs, Burgesses and Commonality of Bedford&quot; to establish a grammar school in the town. The letters instructed boys to be taught by a Master and Usher chosen by the Warden and Fellows of New College, Oxford; Bedford&#x27;s first headmaster was Edmund Greene, a Fellow of the college who had been teaching in Bedford for four years before the establishment of the school – Greene&#x27;s relationship to the college was the reason for its appointment to choose the school&#x27;s leadership.

In the same year, William Harpur, likely an alumnus of the early school on Mill Lane, donated a building to the school, and in 1566 deeded several parcels of meadow around Bedford and Holborn to the school to insure it an income. After a decline in school size following widespread misuse of corporal punishment – a student almost died after being attacked by the school&#x27;s usher – Bedford began boarding in 1656 under the headmastership of George Butler, expanding the school, although boarding ended by 1660. However, the school grew little over the next century and a half due to incompetent headmasters and a lack of funding; it also grew little in social standing as compared to schools such as Winchester, Westminster, or Eton, this may also be partially attributed to its location in Bedford and lack of architecturally attractive estate.

In 1764, the Harpur Trust was formally created by an act of Parliament, the Harpur Trust Act 1764 (4 Geo. 3. c. &quot;72&quot;), to administer Bedford School&#x27;s endowment. After the Great Fire of London, much of Harpur&#x27;s land in London was built on, and so by 1900, the Harpur Trust was receiving payments from these of around £14,000 () per year. Following its foundation, Bedford School expanded greatly, increasing its head count and restoring its buildings. The &quot;Writing School&quot;, now Bedford Modern School, also split to form a separate grammar school.

=== Late modern period ===
Around 1810, headmaster John Brereton restarted boarding at Bedford, although the school still primarily taught day students. By 1820, Bedford had 84 students, of which half were boarders. During Brereton&#x27;s tenure, Bedford took on many characteristics of Victorian public schools, including fagging, and compulsory Christianity. The school&#x27;s curriculum was broadened, and the school was modernised.

==Buildings and grounds==
The Main School Building, originally built in 1891, is a Gothic Revival Grade II listed building. On the night of 3–4 March 1979, much of the building was gutted by fire as a result of arson. The internal structure of the building was destroyed and thirty classrooms were lost. Almost all pupil records were saved but books, furniture and the large collection of portraits of former headmasters were lost. However, the school was in full operation on Monday 5 March.

Bedford School Chapel was completed in 1908 and is a Grade II* listed building. It is significant as the last architectural accomplishment of George Frederick Bodley, a prominent Victorian architect who worked in the Gothic Revival style. Other notable buildings by Bodley include the chapels of Marlborough College and Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. In 2005, various refurbishment projects took place within the chapel. Most significantly, the ceiling was restored to its former Bodlian watercolour design, the original having been painted over in the 1960s due to deterioration. At the same time, the interior walls were redecorated and the stonework cleaned. The chapel is home to Bedford School&#x27;s chapel choir and houses a fine two-manual Hill, Norman &amp; Beard organ. The specification of this instrument can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register.

The Charles Piazzi Smyth Observatory and the Wolfson Planetarium were opened in May 2002 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Situated on the Bedford School estate, the facility is operated by the school&#x27;s astronomer in conjunction with members of the Bedford Astronomical Society. The observatory was named after an Old Bedfordian who went on to become the Astronomer Royal for Scotland. It has a custom-designed GRP dome and a computer-controlled twelve-inch (305mm) telescope. The telescope has a hydrogen alpha filter, which enables the observer to view the magnetic plasma flow around the sun. The adjacent Planetarium was named after the Wolfson Foundation.

==School structure==
===Admissions===

Bedford School aims to maintain the Christian ethos which was embedded into its foundation principles when established, but commits to admitting boys of all faiths, or boys with no faith. 

The first year at Bedford School (for 13- to 14-year-olds) is called the Fourth Form and is equivalent to Year 9 in the state system. After that come the Remove and the Fifth Form. The next two years are the Lower Sixth and the Upper Sixth. Bedford School also caters for the lower years (from Year 3 to Year 8) in Bedford Preparatory School. This is located on the Bedford School estate and many facilities are shared.

Boys attending Bedford School typically come from a variety of various professional families in Bedford, elsewhere in the United Kingdom, as well as overseas. In 2016, the school had 139 boys as English as an Additional Language (EAL), and 57 boys who received additional support in learning for special educational needs, such as dyslexia, and physical disabilities.

===Academic attainment===

Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) inspected Bedford School in November 2016, and found quality of personal development provided for boys attending the school to be &quot;excellent&quot;. Boys attending Bedford School during the inspection were praised for having &quot;respect for others&quot;, having a good &quot;understanding of right and wrong&quot;, showing &quot;kindness and sensitivity&quot; and demonstrating &quot;responsibility for others&quot;. Academic attainment across the school was strong, with boys making &quot;rapid&quot; progress in all curriculum areas whilst developing a wide range of learning skills, including independence of thought and the ability to clearly communicate.

Boys attending the Preparatory School at Bedford School achieve high standards, and in the Senior School, boys academic performance at GCSE level is above the national average. Results in GCSE examinations in the Sixth Form were also strong and found to be above the national average. Boys of all ages across the school, from Preparatory to Sixth Form, were found to be achieving strongly in key areas such as Language and Communication, as well as Numeracy and Mathematics. Following the inspection in November 2016, it was concluded that boys attending Bedford School had well–developed mathematical skills.

=== House system ===
Bedford School has six houses. Each house is composed of a day house and an associated boarding house. The day houses are areas for students to relax during breaks from teaching whilst the boarding houses are for students to reside in. The house names, dating from the mid-nineteenth century, refer to areas of Bedford; boys were originally allocated a house based on the area of town in which they lived. Whilst these are the official house names, it is common for boarders to refer to their house by the name of their boarding house. The houses are:

Ashburnham – The day house is next to the Design and Technology Building. The boarding house, &quot;Sandersons&quot;, is within a ten-minute walk of the school in Rothsay Gardens, next to Redburn.

Bromham – The day house is on Burnaby Road at the main entrance to the school, next to the Rice Building. The school&#x27;s sixth form boarding house, &quot;Burnaby&quot;, is on Burnaby Road.

Crescent – The day house is in a two-storey building towards the south of the school estate. The boarding house, &quot;Pemberley&quot;, is on Pemberley Avenue. The name Crescent derives from The Crescent, a road to the north-east of Bedford town centre running between Bromham Road and Tavistock Street.

Paulo Pontine – The day house occupies a single storey ground floor area beneath the Art Department towards the south of the school estate. The boarding house, &quot;Redburn&quot;, is within a ten-minute walk of the school. The house takes its name from the area around St Paul&#x27;s Church (&#x27;Paulo&#x27;) and the area south of the river, over the Town Bridge (&#x27;Pontine&#x27;).

St Cuthbert&#x27;s – The day house is located next door to the Medical Centre on Burnaby Road. The boarding house, &quot;Phillpotts&quot;, is in the north-east corner of the school estate.

St Peter&#x27;s – The day house occupies a purpose-built building next to its boarding house, &quot;Talbots&quot;, on Burnaby Road.

=== School officials ===
Bedford School monitors are selected from amongst the boys of the Upper Sixth. They are entitled to wear coloured waistcoats and brown shoes as well as brass buttons on their blazers. The head of school and the deputy head are selected from amongst the monitors.

=== Colour system ===
Bedford School recognises individual achievement in various fields by the awarding of &#x27;colours&#x27;, at the discretion of the appropriate master, to boys in the Fifth Form and above. The various colours entitle the bearer to wear a particular variant of his uniform, appropriate to that award, on given days. There are five types of colours: Academic, Arts, Headmaster&#x27;s, House, and Sports (Major and Minor).

==Extracurricular activities==
===Chapel Choir===

The Chapel Choir sings the weekly and special services in Bedford School Chapel. The choir consists of eighteen choristers from the Preparatory School and twenty-four choral scholars from the Upper School, many of whom are former cathedral choristers.

The Chapel Choir regularly sings services and performs concerts in English cathedrals, including St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. The choir also tours abroad in alternate years. Previous destinations have included: Prague (1998); Oslo (2000); Paris (2002), where the choir sang mass in Notre Dame Cathedral; Rome (2004), where the choir sang mass in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica; Ireland (2006); Madrid (2008), and Belgium (2019) .

The choir has made several recordings in recent years. In 2007, the BBC recorded the school&#x27;s Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols for transmission on Christmas Day of that year on BBC Radio under the direction of Andrew Morris, Director of Music at Bedford School between 1979 and 2011.They also recorded A CD entitled &quot;A Bedford Christmas&quot; in 2018.

===School magazines===
Bedford School produces several magazines, of which the most prominent is &quot;The Ousel&quot;, published regularly since 1876. It is largely written by boys and managed directly by the school. It is published at the end of each Summer term and contains pupil and staff reviews of the school year. The school&#x27;s Mosaic Society runs the &quot;Mosaic&quot; magazine which contains a range of essays and articles written by boys on subjects ranging from current affairs and politics to sport and science. In 2011, the Classical Society started a publication, &quot;VIM Magazine&quot;.

===Sport===
Bedford School has a different major sport for each term. The Christmas term is rugby union orientated, the Easter term is devoted to hockey, and Summer is the cricket season. Rowing with the Bedford School Boat Club takes place on the River Ouse throughout the year. Other popular Bedford School sports include athletics, badminton, basketball, canoeing, cross-country running, fencing, fives, football, golf, rifle shooting, sailing, squash, swimming, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, water polo and weight training.

The school produced cricketer Alastair Cook, who went on to captain the England cricket team, and whose coach at Bedford School was sports master and former England batsman Derek Randall. Other Bedford School sportsmen include England rugby internationals Martin Bayfield and Andy Gomarsall; the rower Jack Beresford, winner of five Olympic medals; and 1924 Olympic 100-metre sprint gold medallist Harold Abrahams.

==Headmasters==
Edmund Greene was appointed as headmaster of Bedford School prior to Bedford School&#x27;s foundation in 1552. From then on the Wardens and Fellows of New College, Oxford were given the right to appoint the master (headmaster) and usher (deputy headmaster). This came to an end in 1903, with the appointment of John Edward King to headship. The schools headmasters have been:

<text>Simon Goodrich (1773–1847) was an engineer to the British Navy Board.

==Life==

He was said to have been born 28 October 1773 in Suffolk. His education and training is unknown. In 1796 he was appointed draughtsman in the office of Sir Samuel Bentham, Inspector General of Naval Works, and in 1799 was promoted to the post of Mechanist and Bentham&#x27;s deputy. On the incorporation of the Naval Works Department with the Navy Board in 1808, he was given the title of Mechanist under the Civil Architect and Engineer. The office was discontinued on 25 Dec. 1812 on the abolition of the office of Civil Architect, when it was provided that Goodrich should have preference over others of his profession whenever his services were wanted.

Goodrich was responsible to Bentham for the management of the installation of the machinery at the Portsmouth Block Mills, and for the Metal Mills and millwright&#x27;s shop at Portsmouth. He was also responsible for the mechanical engineering work at all the other Naval Dockyards, and travelled incessantly on Naval business.

As well as his main responsibilities over time he was involved in devising machinery for testing anchor chains; for investigating different firefighting apparatus used on shipboard; reporting on machinery for making rope and cordage, and on saw-milling apparatus; for making seagoing trials of steam vessels. He was also involved greatly in the day-to-day management of the manufacturing staff. He was in close contact with many of the important engineers of the time, including Richard Trevithick, Matthew Murray, Henry Maudslay, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel and, particularly, Joshua Field.

==Family==
Goodrich married Susanna Lloyd on 25 December 1797 at the Navy church of Saint Martin in the Fields, Westminster and had two daughters. He lived at 9 Upper Eton St Pimlico in 1811 and in various locations in Portsmouth. On his retirement Goodrich moved to Lisbon, and died there 3 September 1847 and was survived by his wife.

==Legacy==
After his death, Goodrich&#x27;s papers and drawings were returned to England, and by 1875 were in a library collection somewhere (the location has yet to be discovered). They were later transferred to the library of the Science Museum, London which has now been transferred to Wroughton, Swindon. The SML accessioning records give no clue about the origins. The Simon Goodrich papers are a source of detailed information about what is something of a dark age in our knowledge of the engineering background to the Industrial Revolution.

<text>Salt Tank are two English record producers, David Gates and Malcolm Stanners, plus percussionist and vocalist Andy Rose, from Basingstoke. Their music ranges from laid-back trance, such as their hit single &quot;Eugina&quot; (some of its many versions include a sample from &quot;Me and a Gun&quot; by Tori Amos) to tougher sounds.

==Biography==
The trio recorded several singles before signing a recording contract with Internal Records and securing a UK Top 40 hit single with &quot;Eugina&quot;. Their debut album, &quot;Science and Nature&quot;, was released on that label in 1996. They enjoyed a brief flirtation with the UK Singles Chart in May 1996 when &quot;Eugina&quot; peaked at No. 40. Other such chart entries included &quot;Dimension&quot; (1999, #52) and &quot;Eugina&quot; (remix) (2000, No. 58). By 1991, Stanners and Gates had also recorded three EPs on their own label, 4 Real Communications. The releases created an interest in the dance community, and reached radio via John Peel.

They have collaborated with other musicians such as Chicane, in the track &quot;Leaving Town&quot;, which can be found in Chicane&#x27;s album &quot;Far from the Maddening Crowds&quot;. In turn, Salt Tank had the song remixed by trance artist Mea Culpa and re-titled it, &quot;Pueblo Blanco&quot;. It was issued on 1999&#x27;s &quot;Gatecrasher : Wet&quot;.

Vocalist Andy Rose died in November 2012 following a fight with cancer. Prior to Salt Tank he was joint lead vocalist with UK indie rap band EB and the System. Later he became known as AR Logic.

<doc id="871628" wikidata="Q1432107" url="?curid=871628" title="Spiral Tribe">
<text>Spiral Tribe is an arts collective and free party sound system formed in 1990. It organised free parties, festivals and raves in the UK and later Europe in the 1990s. Spiral Tribe was involved in the Castlemorton Common Festival, and members have released music on labels such as Network 23
and Big Life Records. The sound system combined pagan beliefs with New Age traveller culture and rave to form teknivals. After a hiatus, the collective reformed as SP23 in 2011 and continues to organise events.

==Early history==
Spiral Tribe formed as a sound system in 1990, organising free parties in the UK. Between 1990 and 1992, the collective organised or were involved in over 30 free parties, raves, and festivals in indoor and outdoor locations. The three founding members of Spiral Tribe/SP23 were Mark Harrison, Debbie Griffith and Simone Feeney. According to Harrison, the name Spiral Tribe came to him when he was at work, staring at a poster of the interconnecting spirals in an ammonite shell. The number 23, which is associated with Spiral Tribe, was introduced by Harrison. Despite allusions to the number having been used by Psychic TV and Robert Anton Wilson, he stated that it &quot;had nothing to do with any pre-existing individual, group or subculture&quot;.

== Selected parties ==

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1991, Spiral Tribe held a rave at the then derelict Roundhouse venue in Camden, London, which lasted for a week. The building had previously been used for an &quot;All Night Rave&quot; in the 1960s. Spiral Tribe organised a warehouse rave in Acton Lane, west London on 19 April 1992 (Easter Sunday). The Metropolitan Police decided to shut down the party and since the doors were barricaded, the Territorial Support Group drove a JCB through a wall to enter the party.

In May 1992, the free party circuit moved up a gear and attendances increased heavily. At the beginning of the month, Spiral Tribe joined DiY Sound System and Circus Warp at Lechlade, Gloucestershire. This would reach its peak by the end of May with the Castlemorton Common Festival which became a huge party as an unintended consequence of the police preventing New Age travellers heading for the annual Avon Free Festival. Thirteen members of Spiral Tribe were arrested immediately after the event and subsequently charged with public order offences. Their trial became one of the longest-running and most expensive cases in British legal history, lasting four months and costing the UK £4 million. Spiral Tribe first use the slogan &quot;Make some fucking noise&quot; on t-shirts which they wore in the court room. The judge ordered them to remove these garments. However, when the female defendants revealed that they wore nothing underneath their T-shirts, the judge reversed his instructions, something quite rare in UK courts. Regarding Castlemorton, Nigel South states that &quot;the adverse publicity attending the event laid the groundwork for the Criminal Justice Act 1994&quot;. Police pressure on the collective was increasing. The week after Castlemorton, Spiral Tribe tried to put on a rave but prospective five venues were all shut down. It then organised a rave at Canada Square beside the then half-built Canary Wharf tower in June 1992, which was attended by 1,000 before being stopped.

After participants were eventually acquitted of all charges relating to Castlemorton in March 1993, half of the group moved to Europe shortly afterwards, doing parties in the Netherlands, Germany and Austria. In Berlin, Spiral Tribe made their base at Kunsthaus Tacheles with the Mutoid Waste Company.

Over the next few years, the collective organised parties and teknivals throughout Europe, then it slowly dispersed with some members taking up residence in Germany and the Netherlands and releasing work on Labworks and many other techno labels. Individual members of the collective joined other sound systems such as Facom Unit, Sound Conspiracy and Total Resistance. Spiral Tribe also toured the USA in the late 1990s.

== Legacy ==
Spiral Tribe became an influential pioneer of the teknival and free party scene in western Europe and north America. It forged a new techno-punk identity out of rave and New Age traveller culture, which brought in pagan influences. Members of the collective promoted the use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin. The music of Spiral Tribe inspired other sound systems such as Desert Storm, Teknocrates, Nomades, OQP and Psychiatrik. Low and Barnett opine in &quot;Spaces of Democracy&quot; that &quot;Spiral Tribe, with their free and inclusive parties, succeeded in constituting an alternative public space, rather than just a secret one&quot;. Creating temporary autonomous zones through squatting venues, the collective could set the volume as high as it wanted and drug use was not restricted.

The DVD &quot;World Traveller Adventures&quot; (named after the Spiral Tribe track &quot;World Traveller Adventurer&quot;) includes films about Spiral Tribe and other sound systems, tracking how they organised parties, as well as overground journeys. In 2019, Seana Gavin put on an exhibition in Paris about the legacy of Spiral Tribe and then released a book called &quot;Spiralled&quot;. A documentary entitled &quot;Free Party: A Folk History&quot; was announced in 2021 which included interviews with members of Spiral Tribe.

== 2011 reform ==
In 2011, several of the original members of Spiral Tribe reformed as SP23, a creative collective involved in a number of grassroots and community projects as well as still organising parties. A return to the UK party was held in London in April 2013 at Village Underground club; the lineup was Crystal Distortion, 69DB, Ixindamix, Jeff23, Meltdown Mickey, the Bad Girlz and Sirius. Since then, SP23 have hosted across Europe. Members of SP23 are Mark (a.k.a. Stray Wayward), Debbie (a.k.a. Feenix13), David (a.k.a. Dave808), Simone (a.k.a. Sim Simmer), Meltdown Mickey, Simon (a.k.a. Crystal Distortion), Sebastian (a.k.a. 69db), Ixindamix, Jeff 23, Max Volume and Charlie Kane. Jeff 23 and Simone formed the group Artists in Action in order to raise money to support refugees by releasing compilation albums.

==Discography==

In 1992, some members of the collective signed to the major label Big Life Records, as a result of the publicity generated from their involvement in the organisation of the Castlemorton Common Festival. Three EPs were released with them enjoying short crossover success with &quot;Forward the Revolution&quot; and &quot;Breach the Peace&quot;, an album &quot;Tekno Terra&quot;, as well as a compilation. The track &quot;Breach the Peace&quot; included samples of police officers talking about Castlemorton.

Members of Spiral Tribe also released records on their own label Network 23. In 1997, Techno Import, a French commercial distributor, compiled a CD entitled &quot;Spiral Tribe: The Sound of Teknival&quot;. The CD was released without any consent from members of Spiral Tribe, was advertised on television and sold an estimated 30,000 copies.

<text>Gustav Ludwig Heinrich Mützel (December 7, 1839 – October 29, 1893) was a German artist, famous for his mammal and bird paintings, including the illustrations for the second edition of Alfred Edmund Brehm&#x27;s &quot;Thierleben&quot; and Richard Lydekker&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Natural History&quot;.

Gustav Mützel was the son of the painter Heinrich Mützel and his wife Luise Pauline Friedrichs. He attended the French high school in his hometown. Subsequently, Mützel began to study at the Academy of Art at age 18 and was, amongst others, a pupil of the painter Eduard Daege.

On 1 November 1865 Mützel married Anna Schönherr in Berlin and raised three children; Hans, Walter and Gertrud. Mützel and his wife settled in Königsberg in the Neumark, where he was active as photographer. To keep up with the latest technical developments in photography Mützel and his family moved to Berlin in 1870.

After the Franco-German War Mützel started illustrating some of the more important encyclopedias of the time. He created a large number of illustrations for the German Ornithological Society, having been a member since 1874. Mützel&#x27;s diverse interests led also to his membership of the German Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory and the Association of Berlin artists. The Nießen&#x27;sche Choral Society awarded him with an honorary membership.

Gustav Mützel died at his home (Hagelsberger Str. 10) at the age of 54 years on 29 October 1893 of heart and kidney ailments. He was interred at the cemetery in Mariendorf on 1 November.

<text>The Avenue of the Saints is a highway in the Midwestern United States that connects St. Louis, Missouri, and St. Paul, Minnesota.
==Route description==

===Missouri===
The southern end of the Avenue of the Saints is at exit 28A on Interstate 64/U.S. Route 40 (I-64/US 40), which is also the southern end of its concurrency with US 61. The Avenue of the Saints heads west, to Chesterfield, crossing I-270. Here, the Avenue of the Saints turns northwest, crosses the Missouri River via the Daniel Boone Bridge. In Wentzville, the route intersects I-70. The western end of I‑64 and the northern end of the concurrency with US 40 is here. The Avenue of the Saints continues north as just US 61, intersects with the western end of I-72 in Hannibal, reaches the northern terminus of its concurrency with US 61, then crosses the Des Moines River into Iowa.

The Avenue of the Saints is co-signed with Missouri Route 27 to the Iowa state line. Prior to its designation as Route 27, the section between US 61 and US 136 was designated Spur US 136. The section north of US 136 was Missouri Supplemental Route B.

===Iowa===
In Iowa, the Avenue of the Saints is a highway, which begins in Lee County where Missouri Route 27 crosses the Des Moines River, and ends at the Iowa state line in Worth County, concurrent with Interstate 35. Construction of the Avenue of the Saints corridor in Iowa was completed on May 23, 2006.

The route runs north from the Missouri state line as just Iowa Highway 27 for about , then is co-signed with US 218 until just south of Cedar Rapids, crossing I-80 in Iowa City. This is also the location of the southern end of its concurrency with I‑380, and this concurrency terminates in Waterloo. Near Floyd, US 218 splits off, just after the route starts a concurrency with US 18, running west to its intersection with I-35, where the route turns north again and runs into Minnesota.

In 2001, the Iowa Department of Transportation designated the Avenue of the Saints as Iowa 27. Prior to its creation, motorists wanting to travel the Avenue through Iowa had to follow a lengthy list of directions: &quot;(heading north from Missouri)&quot; Iowa 394, US 218, I‑380, US 20, Iowa 58, US 218 (again), US 18 and I‑35.

As with many rural expressways in Iowa, the Avenue of the Saints has exit numbers in that state. The exit numbers correspond to the underlying U.S. Highway or Interstate Highway – US 218, I-380, US 20, US 18 and I‑35. The section along Iowa 58 in Cedar Falls has no exit numbers, and the separate section south of Donnellson has one numbered exit—the northbound one to US 218 south—based on Iowa 27&#x27;s mileage.

===Minnesota===
In Minnesota, the Avenue of the Saints is officially routed along I-35 and I-35E for the entirety of its length in that state, but is not marked anywhere within the state. The route runs straight north, crosses I-90 in Albert Lea, and runs to its northern end in St. Paul, shortly after crossing the Mississippi River via the Lexington Bridge.

==History==

The Avenue of the Saints was the concept of businessman Ernest Hayes of Mount Pleasant, Iowa who in the 1980s envisioned a four-lane highway between St. Paul and St. Louis. It was named by Gary Smith, who at the time was Executive Director of the Southeast Iowa Regional Planning Commission. Smith and Hayes convened a group of area business and political leaders, who organized an effort to convince the Iowa Department of Transportation to study the idea, which they did in 1988. Several politicians endorsed the idea, including then-mayor Tom Vilsack of Mount Pleasant, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and Congressmen David Nagle and Fred Grandy of Iowa and Dick Gephardt of Missouri.

By the end of 1989, four possible routes for the Avenue of the Saints were under consideration by the Federal Highway Administration. Two of the rejected routes would have followed US 52 and US 63 from St. Paul through Rochester, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa. The third rejected route would have followed US 61 from St. Paul through La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Dubuque, Iowa to Davenport, Iowa and US 67 from Davenport, crossing the Mississippi River through western Illinois to Alton, Illinois and crossing the Mississippi and Missouri rivers to St. Louis.

In 1990 the FHWA chose its route for the Avenue of the Saints: the signed highway would follow the existing Interstate 35 from St. Paul to a point south of Clear Lake, Iowa; U.S. Route 18 to Charles City, Iowa; U.S. Route 218 to Cedar Falls, Iowa; U.S. Route 20 and Iowa Highway 58 around Cedar Falls and Waterloo, Iowa; Interstate 380 from Waterloo through Cedar Rapids to Interstate 80 near Coralville, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; U.S. Route 218 to Donnellson, Iowa; Iowa Highway 394 and Route B to Wayland, Missouri; and Interstate 64 and U.S. Route 61 from Wayland to St. Louis.

The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 made the Avenue of the Saints an official &quot;high-priority corridor,&quot; and signs were put along the route by the end of the year. At that time the only four-lane segments were I‑35, I‑380, and I‑64; US 20 around Waterloo; US 218 from I‑80 to Iowa 22 near Riverside, Iowa; and two segments of US 61 in Missouri (from La Grange to New London and from Bowling Green to St. Louis). As a cost-saving measure, the government decided to build the Avenue of the Saints to expressway standards—with intersections at rural roads—rather than to full freeway standards. Freeway segments would be built around cities that needed to be bypassed.

After the routing was approved, both Iowa and Missouri began constructing new four-lane segments. Iowa opened bypasses around Waverly (1998), Mason City (1999), Charles City (2000), Mount Pleasant (2001), and Donnellson (2004). A four-lane link between I‑35 and I‑380 was completed with the opening of a segment near Nashua in November 2003. Missouri completed four-lane segments from New London to Bowling Green in November 2000, and from Canton to La Grange in 2003.

In 2001, the Iowa Department of Transportation gave the Avenue of the Saints its own highway number: Highway 27 (Iowa 27). The number was added as an additional number to the existing routes; however, after the Donnellson bypass opened in 2004, Iowa Highway 394 was decommissioned and Iowa 27 is now a stand-alone highway south of the split with US 218. A new four-lane bridge across the Des Moines River was opened at the end of 2004, replacing an existing toll bridge operated by the Wayland Special Road District. A new four-lane road between the bridge and US 61 south of Wayland, Missouri opened on the same day; it was numbered by Missouri as Route 27 to match Iowa&#x27;s number for the Avenue of the Saints.

In June 2005, a four-lane segment from the end of the Mount Pleasant bypass to the junction with Iowa Highway 16 east of Houghton was opened to four lanes of traffic. The segment of Iowa 27 between the split with US 218 and the Des Moines River bridge opened to four lanes on August 25, 2005. The last remaining segment in Iowa was opened to traffic on May 23, 2006.

In 2007, an interchange was installed at Route C in Moscow Mills, Missouri. This was later done to Route U and South Lincoln Drive as well.

On July 25, 2008, the final of highway between the Lewis—Clark county line and Wayland, Missouri, was open to four-lane traffic. A ceremony was held at the intersection of US 61 and Route 27 to commemorate the completion of the four-lane highway in Missouri. The Avenue of the Saints is now complete from St. Paul to suburban St. Louis.

As a result of the narrow lanes and constant problems with the aging westbound structure, MODOT started studies for a new replacement of the westbound Daniel Boone bridge in around 2001 or 2002. Funding was finally unveiled in 2011, and in November 2012 a design-build contract was awarded to the Walsh-Alberici joint venture team with designer Burns &amp; McDonnell. Construction started in 2013 on a girder bridge, located upstream of the two existing bridges. All four eastbound lanes were routed onto the new bridge on June 28, 2015. The new bridge also features a bike/pedestrian attachment, which connects the Katy Trail to the Monarch Levee Trail.

The Iowa Department of Transportation rebuilt the Avenue of the Saints interchange with I‑80 and I‑380/US 218/Iowa 27 in Coralville. As the Eastern Iowa region has grown, traffic has increased, and the current arrangement of the interchange with its cloverleaf ramps has been deemed unsafe. The interchange was rebuilt as a turbine interchange, which will eliminate weaving. The project was completed in August 2023 after 5 years of the project.

==Future==
The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDot) has published initial maps for the Hannibal Expressway, a bypass around Hannibal, Missouri. According to the maps, the Hannibal Expressway would depart from US 61 south of Hannibal, travel in a northwesterly direction toward the Rocket Junction where it would intersect with US 36/I-72 and US 24 West. The Hannibal Expressway would then travel along the current US 24 East alignment and re-connect with US 61 north of the Rocket Junction. The &quot;Hannibal Expressway&quot; project is unfunded. There are seven stoplights along US 61 in Hannibal: Red Devil Road/Warren Barrett Drive, Market Street (Business 61), Highway MM (Business 36), West Ely Road, I‑72/US 36, Stardust Drrive/Pirate Pride, and Route 168.

==Major intersections==
The segment that concurs with US 61 is unsigned and has multiple at grade intersections.

<doc id="871644" wikidata="Q5733912" url="?curid=871644" title="Herbert Dixon, 1st Baron Glentoran">
<text>Herbert Dixon, 1st Baron Glentoran, OBE, PC (NI), DL (23 January 1880 – 20 July 1950) was a Unionist politician from Ireland, present-day Northern Ireland.

==Early life==
Dixon was born in Belfast, the fourth son of Sir Daniel Dixon, 1st Baronet, and Annie Shaw. He was educated at Rugby School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before being commissioned into the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers as a second lieutenant on 20 January 1900. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 May 1901, and served with the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons in the Second Boer War in South Africa in 1902. After the war he returned home in September 1902, and was posted at Curragh Camp. He later fought with the British Army in the First World War.

==Political career==
In 1918 Dixon was elected Unionist Member of Parliament for the seat of Belfast Pottinger, becoming representative for Belfast East four years later. He was also sent to the Northern Ireland House of Commons in 1921 as a member for Belfast East, being appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, and was finally elected member for the seat of Belfast Bloomfield in 1929.

Dixon was appointed OBE in 1919 and admitted to the Privy Council of Northern Ireland in 1923. In 1939 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Glentoran, of Ballyalloly in the County of Down. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Government Chief Whip from 1921 to 1942 and as Minister of Agriculture in the Parliament of Northern Ireland from 1941 to 1943. In May 1950 he succeeded his elder brother Sir Thomas Dixon as third baronet.

==Marriage and children==
On 25 November 1905 Lord Glentoran married the Hon Emily Ina Florence Bingham, daughter of John Bingham, 5th Baron Clanmorris. They had five children together:

* Hon Daphne Maude Dixon (died 6 April 1942)
* Hon Anne Lavinia Dixon (died 16 September 1971)
* Hon Angela Ierne Evelyn Dixon (born 16 February 1907, died October 2003), married Lieutenant-Commander the Hon Peter Ross RN (born 8 August 1906, killed in action 14 October 1940), elder son of Una Ross, 25th Baroness de Ros with whom she had two daughters including Georgiana Maxwell, 26th Baroness de Ros.
* Colonel Daniel Stewart Thomas Bingham Dixon, 2nd Baron Glentoran (born 19 January 1912, died 22 July 1995)
* Hon Patricia Clare Dixon (born 1919)

Lord Glentoran died in July 1950, aged 70, and was succeeded in his titles by his son Daniel. Lady Glentoran died in 1957.

<text>The North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS) is a US-based cartographic society founded in 1980. It was founded by specialists in cartography, which included government mapmakers, map librarians, cartography professors and cartography lab directors. It now represents a broad mixture of academic, government and commercial interests, with a sizeable proportion of working cartographers. Many NACIS members come from related vocations (e.g. art, design, information visualization, GIS, historical research, and software development.) NACIS offers both volunteer opportunities and travel grants for students and members of the community.

==Objectives==
To improve communication, coordination and cooperation among the producers, disseminators, curators, and users of cartographic information.
To support and coordinate activities with other professional organizations and institutions involved with cartographic information.
To improve the use of cartographic materials through education and to promote graphicacy.
To promote and coordinate the acquisition, preservation, and automated retrieval of all types of cartographic material.

==Membership==
The membership is largely from the United States and Canada, with a small but steady number from other countries. In recent years, NACIS has focused on increasing membership in Latin America and the Caribbean.

<doc id="871651" wikidata="Q2905575" url="?curid=871651" title="Blackout (Marcus Daniels)">
<text>Blackout (Marcus Daniels) is the name of a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the first character to use the name within the Marvel Universe.

Patrick Brennan portrayed the character in two episodes of the first season of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;

==Publication history==
Blackout first appeared in &quot;Nova&quot; #19 and was created by Marv Wolfman, Carmine Infantino, and Tom Palmer.

==Fictional character biography==
Marcus Daniels was born in Flushing, Queens, New York City. He was working as a laboratory assistant to Dr. Abner Croit, a physicist hoping to build a device capable of tapping into energies from other dimensions. Croit always looked down on Daniels&#x27; inferior knowledge, making him feel useless. Daniels always wondered what it would be like to harness the energy they were researching, to be powerful. After an accident bathed him in the extra-dimensional energy of the Darkforce, he had the chance to find out. Calling himself Blackout, his body was now flushed with power, becoming a surface of control of the Darkforce dimension. However, despite his powers threatening to go out of control, he escaped from Croit&#x27;s attempts to cure him and fled.

Blackout returned to the laboratories, however, as he needed the stabilizer device to control his energies. But he also returned to find revenge on Croit— Blackout&#x27;s sanity began to suffer as well. He believed Croit was researching energies from &quot;Black Stars&quot; and that his body now generated such energy. He further believed that Croit was defrauding the government with his research and had bribed a judge to frame him for stealing his secrets. Instead of an accident causing his powers, Daniels thought Dr. Croit willfully subjected him to an experiment in exchange for dropping charges against him.

Nova encountered Blackout on his way to exact revenge, and Blackout easily defeated the young hero. Before Nova could catch up with him, Blackout returned to the labs, killing Croit and his new assistant by letting them “merge with the color spectrum” (actually, by shunting them to the Darkforce dimension). Following another skirmish with Nova, Blackout himself vanished into this dimension when he fell back onto the stabilizer during the battle, destroying it.

The stabilizer somehow ended up at Project Pegasus, the government energy research laboratory. An attack by the Lava Men and the presence of Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau) managed to activate the device, which transported Blackout back to Earth. Still suffering from the delusion that Croit was still alive and out to harm him, he tried to escape. Blackout was coerced by another Project captive, Moonstone, into freeing herself and other superhuman criminals Electro and Rhino in order to gain revenge on their captors. The villains were confronted by the Avengers, but Blackout and Moonstone escaped to the Darkforce Dimension by nearly causing the nuclear core of the complex to melt down as a distraction.

Moonstone, a former psychiatrist, treated Blackout in order to learn his true origin, but he remained in an irrational state. When the Avengers tracked them down, Blackout opened up another aperture into the Darkforce dimension in attempting to escape them, sucking himself and Moonstone inside. Moonstone helped Blackout navigate through the dimension, eventually arriving on the surface of the Moon. She hoped to find another stone similar to that which gave her powers, but they encountered the Inhumans and their ally, Dazzler, who defeated the villains and returned them to Project: Pegasus on Earth.

Moonstone next appeared recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to form his version of the Masters of Evil, and she brought Blackout in tow. By this time, Blackout&#x27;s mental condition was so unstable that at times he sank into a nearly catatonic state, only responsive to Moonstone&#x27;s manipulative commands. Zemo, however, with the help of the Fixer had created a device to mentally force Blackout to obey his commands. Blackout was instrumental in Zemo&#x27;s takeover of the Avengers&#x27; headquarters by sending the entire mansion into the Darkforce dimension in one of the team&#x27;s darkest hours. Doctor Druid, used his psychic ability to break through Zemo and Moonstone&#x27;s manipulations, restoring some of Blackout&#x27;s mental faculties. With relative sanity restored, Blackout resisted Zemo&#x27;s mental commands, the strain of which made Blackout collapse from a massive cerebral hemorrhage.

Blackout&#x27;s body was remanded into the custody of the Commission on Superhuman Activities. Years later, his body was taken by Baron Zemo, manipulated like a puppet on strings to serve as a member of his team as he confronted the new Thunderbolts over the life of their member Photon. During the battle between the two teams, Zemo revealed Blackout was merely a shell in which he kept the Smuggler trapped. This had the desired effect of turning his brother, Atlas against his team, and Zemo gained the upper hand. He also used Blackout&#x27;s access to the Darkforce dimension in severing Photon&#x27;s physical form.

A person who looks like the original Blackout appears as part of the Hood&#x27;s alliance with super-powered heroes. He was later seen during the Siege of Asgard as part of the Hood crime syndicate.

During the &quot;Opening Salvo&quot; part of the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Blackout in the alias of &quot;Bob Hofstedder&quot; is later seen living as a married family man until he is found by Baron Zemo, who persuades him to join the Army of Evil. Blackout helps Baron Zemo trap some of the heroes in Manhattan by surrounding it in Darkforce shadows in order to further HYDRA&#x27;s plot. After the Tony Stark A.I. and Hawkeye infiltrated Hydra&#x27;s prison that is run by Crossbones and Sin, Maria Hill located &quot;Bob&quot; and shoots him in the head enough to drop the Darkforce dome around Manhattan.

During the &quot;Damnation&quot; storyline, Blackout is revived when Doctor Strange uses his magic to restore Las Vegas.

Blackout appears with Hood&#x27;s gang in their fight against Iron Man, Victor von Doom, a rebooted War Machine, and a battalion of Doombots.

At the start of the &quot;Blood Hunt&quot; storyline, Blackout briefly appears as one of the Darkforce users that &quot;exploded&quot; and became portals to the Darkforce Dimension, blocking out the Sun enough to cause a vampire invasion.

==Powers and abilities==
The first Blackout was exposed to cosmic radiation, giving him the power to tap into the Darkforce, a source of infinite dark energy, and to manipulate it in various ways. He could project Darkforce as concussive energy with tremendous force. Blackout could mentally open portals to and from the Darkforce dimension. He could create and control simple, solid geometric shapes from Darkforce, such as discs, cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes. These objects absorbed energy directed against them, and would remain solid as long as he exerted conscious control over them. He could psionically levitate Darkforce objects, and could fly by riding on them. Blackout was mentally unstable due to his time spent in the Darkforce Dimension, and sometimes entered a nearly catatonic state. His control over Darkforce was dependent on his mental clarity, and would weaken when he was fatigued. Training with Moonstone allowed him to maintain his Darkforce constructs for a considerably longer period of time. Blackout wore a costume with circuitry that helped him confine the Darkforce within his body. The costume was designed by Dr. Abner Croit. Blackout had a master&#x27;s degree in physics, especially in the study of radiation.

<text>Sinosauropteryx (meaning &quot;Chinese reptilian wing&quot;) is an extinct genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs. Described in 1996, it was the first dinosaur taxon outside of Avialae (birds and their immediate relatives) to be found with evidence of feathers. It was covered with a coat of very simple filament-like feathers. Structures that indicate the colour pattern have also been preserved in some of its feathers, which show that &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; had a countershading pattern in its body with a banded tail. The reddish brown colouration previously inferred for &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; is based on the melanosomes preserved in the specimen of a separate genus, &quot;Huadanosaurus&quot;. Some contention has arisen with an alternative interpretation of the filamentous impression as remains of collagen fibres, but this has not been widely accepted.

&quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; was a small theropod with an unusually long tail and short arms. The longest known specimen reaches up to in length, with an estimated weight of . It was considered a close relative of the similar but older genus &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, with both genera belonging to the family Compsognathidae, though subsequent analyses did not recover this family to be monophyletic and placed &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; within its own family, Sinosauropterygidae. Two species of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; have been named. The first, S. prima, is known from three specimens, named &quot;first&quot; in reference to its status as the first feathered non-avialian dinosaur species discovered. The third specimen previously assigned to &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; most likely represents a tyrannosauroid unrelated to this genus. The second, S. lingyuanensis, is known from a single specimen, named after its type locality.

&quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; lived in what is now northeastern China during the early Cretaceous period. It was among the first dinosaurs discovered from the Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province, and was a member of the Jehol Biota. Well-preserved fossils of this species illustrate many aspects of its biology, such as its diet and reproduction.

==Description==

&quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; was a small bipedal theropod, noted for its short arms, large first finger (thumbs), and long tail. The taxon includes some of the smallest known adult non-avian theropod specimens, with the holotype specimen measuring only in length, including the tail. However, this individual was relatively immature. The longest known specimen reaches up to in length, with an estimated weight of . A subsequent paper estimated its mass to be .

&quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; was anatomically similar to &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, differing from its European relatives in its proportions. The skull of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; was 15% longer than its thigh bones, unlike in &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, where the skull and thigh bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; (humerus and radius) were only 30% the length of its legs (thigh bone and shin), compared to 40% in &quot;Compsognathus&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 vertebrae in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod. Its hands were long compared to its arms, about 84% to 91% of the length of the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot. The first and second digits were about the same length, with a large claw on the first digit. The first fingers were large, being both longer and thicker than either of the bones of the forearm. The teeth differed slightly (they were heterodont) based on position: those near the tips of the upper jaws (on the premaxillae) were slender and lacked serrations, while those behind them (on the maxillae) were serrated and laterally compressed. The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.

A pigmented area in the abdomen of the holotype has been suggested as possible traces of organs, and was interpreted as the liver by John Ruben and colleagues, which they described as part of a crocodilian-like &quot;hepatic piston&quot; respiratory system. A later study, while agreeing that the pigmented area represented something originally inside the body, found no defined structure and noted that any organs would have been distorted by the processes that flattened the skeleton into an essentially two-dimensional form. Dark pigment is also present in the eye region of the holotype and another specimen.

===Feathers===
All described specimens of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; preserve integumentary structures (filaments arising from the skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as a primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and top and bottom of the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified on the sides of the body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.

The filaments are preserved with a gap between the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with subcutaneous structures.
The filaments exhibit random orientations and are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.

The length of the filaments varies across the body. On the type specimen, they are shortest just in front of the eyes, with a length of . Going further along the body, the filaments rapidly increase in length until reaching lengths of over the shoulder blades. The length remains uniform over the back, until beyond the hips, when the filaments lengthen again and reach their maximum length midway down the tail at . The filaments on the underside of the tail are shorter overall and decrease in length more rapidly than those on the dorsal surface. By the 25th tail vertebrae, the filaments on the underside reach a length of only . The longest feathers present on the forearm measured .

Though the feathers are too dense to isolate a single structure for examination, several studies have suggested the presence of two distinct filament types (thick and thin) interspersed with each other. The thick filaments tend to appear &#x27;stiffer&#x27; than thin filaments, and the thin filaments tend to lie parallel to each other but at angles to nearby thick filaments. These properties suggest that the individual feathers consisted of a central quill (&quot;rachis&quot;) with thinner &quot;barbs&quot; branching off from it, similar to but more primitive in structure than modern bird feathers. Overall, the filaments most closely resemble the &quot;plumules&quot; or down-like feathers of some modern birds, with a thick central quill and long, thin barbs. The same structures are seen in other fossils from the Yixian Formation, including &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;.

However, a 2018 study considered that the thick filaments could simply be bundles of thin filaments overlapping each other. This possibility is supported by the observation that thin filaments tend to run parallel to both each other &quot;and&quot; thick filaments, rather than branching out as earlier authors identified. Some of the thick filaments are quite long yet end in small tufts of thin filaments. Plumaceous, down-like feathering typically has an opposite appearance, with a short central quill and long tufts. In addition, the thick filaments preserve no evidence of Calcium phosphate, the mineral which modern feather quills are made of. The large amount of curvature present in the filaments also makes a strong central quill unlikely. Thus, the idea that thick filaments are simply bundles of thin filaments is less unusual than the idea that they were a variant of quilled plumaceous feathers which developed a morphology opposite that of birds and other feathered theropods. As a whole, the study preferred the hypothesis that &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; feathers were simple single-branch filaments, although it is conceivable that they were occasionally joined at the base into tufts as predecessors to down-like plumaceous feathers.

While &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; had feather-like structures, it was not very closely related to the previous &quot;first bird&quot; &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. There are many dinosaur clades that were more closely related to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; than &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; was, including the deinonychosaurians, the oviraptorosaurians, and the therizinosauroids. This indicates that feathers may have been a characteristic of many theropod dinosaurs, not just the obviously bird-like ones, making it quite likely that equally distant animals such as &quot;Compsognathus&quot; had feathers as well.

====Colouration====
&quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; was the first dinosaur to have its life colouration described by scientists based on physical evidence. Some fossils of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; show an alternation of lighter and darker bands preserved on the tail. Chen and colleagues initially interpreted this banding pattern as an artifact of the splitting between the main slab and counter slab in which the original specimen was preserved. However, Longrich suggested in his 2002 presentation for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology that these specimens actually preserve remnants of the colouration pattern the animal would have exhibited in life. He argued that the dark, banded areas on the tail were too evenly spaced to have been caused by random separation of the fossil slabs, and that they represent fossilized pigments present in the feathers. Additionally, rather than an artifact of preservation or decomposition, the presence of dark feathers along only the top of the body may also reflect the colour pattern in life, indicating that &quot;Sinosauropteryx prima&quot; was countershaded with dark colouration on its back and lighter colouration on its underside, with bands or stripes on the tail for camouflage.

Longrich&#x27;s conclusions were supported in a paper first published online in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in January 2010. Fucheng Zhang and colleagues examined the fossilized feathers of several dinosaurs and early birds, and found evidence that they preserved melanosomes, the cell components that give the feathers of modern birds their colour. Among the specimens studied was a previously undescribed specimen of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, IVPP V14202, though this specimen is now the holotype of a separate genus &quot;Huadanosaurus&quot;. By examining melanosome structure and distribution, Zhang and colleagues were able to confirm the presence of light and dark bands of colour in the tail feathers of this specimen (now the holotype of &quot;Huadanosaurus&quot;) like that of a red panda. Furthermore, the team was able to compare melanosome types to those of modern birds to determine a general range of colour. From the presence of phaeomelanosomes, spherical melanosomes that make and store red pigment, they concluded that the darker feathers of this specimen were chestnut or reddish brown in colour. More research on the coloration of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; based on three specimens (NIGP 127586, NIGP 127587, and IVPP V12415) reveals that it had a raccoon-like bandit mask and countershading patterns most likely associated with an open habitat, indicating that the Jehol likely had a range of habitat types.

==History of discovery==
The first fossil specimen of the dinosaur later named &quot;Sinosauropteryx prima&quot; was uncovered in August 1996 by Li Yumin. Yumin was a farmer and part-time fossil hunter who often prospected around Liaoning Province to acquire fossils to sell to individuals and museums. Yumin recognized the unique quality of the specimen, which was separated into two slabs, and sold the slabs to two separate museums in China: the National Geological Museum in Beijing, and the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology. The director of the Beijing museum, Ji Qiang, recognized the importance of the find, as did visiting Canadian palaeontologist Phil Currie and artist Michael Skrepnick, who became aware of the fossil by chance as they explored the Beijing museum&#x27;s collections after leading a fossil tour of the area during the first week of October, 1996. Currie recognized the significance of the fossil immediately. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted him, &quot;When I saw this slab of siltstone mixed with volcanic ash in which the creature is embedded, I was bowled over.&quot; When originally described, the authors named &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, meaning &quot;Chinese Reptilian Wing&quot;.

Chinese authorities initially barred photographs of the specimen from publication. However, Currie brought a photograph to the 1996 meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, causing crowds of palaeontologists to gather and discuss the new discovery. The news reportedly left palaeontologist John Ostrom, who in the 1970s had pioneered the theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs, &quot;in a state of shock.&quot; Ostrom later joined an international team of researchers who gathered in Beijing to examine the fossils; other team members included feather expert Alan Brush, fossil bird expert Larry Martin, and Peter Wellnhofer, an expert on the early bird &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.

Three specimens have been assigned to &quot;Sinosauropteryx prima&quot;: the holotype GMV 2123 (and its counter slab [opposite face], NIGP 127586), NIGP 127587, and D 2141. Another specimen, IVPP V14202, was originally assigned to the genus in 2010, but was later designated as the holotype of a separate genus &quot;Huadanosaurus&quot;. The assignment of an additional larger specimen to &quot;S. prima&quot;, GMV 2124 (also known as NGMC 2124), was later found to be in error, and most likely belongs to Tyrannosauroidea. All of the fossils were found in the Jianshangou or Dawangzhangzi Beds of the Yixian Formation in the Beipiao and Lingyuan regions of Liaoning, China. These fossil beds have been dated to 124.6–122 million years ago, during the early Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous.

===Identity of filaments===
Controversy regarding the identity of the filaments preserved in the first &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined the specimen, wrote in &quot;Audubon Magazine&quot; that the structures of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, as &quot;Compsognathus prima&quot;) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over the identity of the structures.

Feduccia&#x27;s frill argument was followed up in several other publications, in which researchers interpreted the filamentous impressions around &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; fossils as remains of collagen fibres rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the fibres formed a frill on the back of the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would refute the proposal that &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also raise questions about the current theory of feather origins itself. It calls into question the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.

Most researchers have disagreed with the identification of the structures as collagen or other structural fibres. Notably, the team of scientists that reported the presence of pigmentation cells in the structures argued that their presence proved the structures were feathers, not collagen, because collagen does not contain pigment. Gregory S. Paul reidentified what the collagen hypothesis&#x27;s proponents consider a body outline outside of the fibres as an artefact of preparation: breakage and brushed-on sealant have been misidentified as the outline of the body.

The hypothesis that the structures were collagen fibers was closely analyzed and disproven by a 2017 paper published by Smithwick &quot;et al&quot;. The integument of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; was closely compared to less controversial evidence of collagen fibers preserved in the ichthyosaur &quot;Stenopterygius&quot;. Although the collagen hypothesis claimed that the central shafts (rachises) of purported theropod feathers were actually misidentified examples of shaft-like collagen fibers, higher quality imagery showed that these similarities were artificial. The supposed shafts in ichthyosaur collagen were actually scratch marks, cracks, and crevasses created during preparation of one of the ichthyosaur specimens. On the other hand, the shafts in the &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; specimens were legitimate examples of fossilized structures. The collagen hypothesis also claims that &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; integument includes beaded structures similar to structures occasionally found in decaying collagen of modern sea mammals. However, this claim was also unsupported, with Smithwick &quot;et al.&quot; finding no evidence of the beaded structures which collagen hypothesis proponents identified on the specimens. The study proposes that some areas of the fossil preserved in three dimensions cast shadows which would have resembled beaded structures in low quality photographs.

Other examples of purported collagen fibers in the tail area were revealed to be scratches, similar to those on the rest of the specimen. An area of the bone with an irregular surface was considered evidence that some collagen fibers were less decayed than others. However, Smithwick &quot;et al.&#x27;s&quot; study noted that, after further preparation, this irregular surface was simply a layer of sediment with a different color than the rest of the slab. The &#x27;frill&#x27; or &#x27;halo&#x27; of collagen identified by Feduccia was also determined to be misidentified sediment surrounding one of the specimens. Smithwick &quot;et al&quot;.&#x27;s study concluded by stating that the integument preserved on &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; closely resembled that of birds preserved in the same formation. Purported features of collagen fibers were in fact misidentified shadows formed by scratches or irregular sediment, a misidentification perpetuated by the low quality of early &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; photographs.

==Classification==

Despite its feathers, most palaeontologists do not consider &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; to be a bird. Phylogenetically, the genus is only distantly related to the clade Aves, usually defined as &quot;Archaeopteryx lithographica&quot; plus modern birds. The scientists who described &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, however, used a character-based, or apomorphic, definition of the Class Aves, in which any animal with feathers is considered to be a bird. They argued that the filamentous plumes of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; represent true feathers with a rachis and barbs, and thus that &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; should be considered a true bird. They classified the genus as belonging to a new biological order, Sinosauropterygiformes, family Sinosauropterygidae, within the subclass Sauriurae. These proposals have not been accepted, and &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; is generally classified in the family Compsognathidae, a group of small-bodied long-tailed coelurosaurian theropods known from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Asia, Europe, and South America.

Below is a cladogram showing the placement of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; within Coelurosauria by Senter &quot;et al.&quot; in 2012.

In 2024, Andrea Cau published a study on the phylogenetics of compsognathids that called the assessment of these taxa into question. The paper recovered &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, along with three other proposed compsognathids in a polytomy within basal Coelurosauria. This polytomy notably did not include &quot;Composognathus&quot; proper, which would make none of these species compsognathids.
In their description of &quot;S. lingyuanensis&quot;, Qiu et al. (2025) also commented on the monophyly of Compsognathidae and revived the previously monotypic Sinosauropterygidae within Coelurosauria as a monophyletic family containing all compsognathid-like theropods from the Jehol Biota of China (&quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, &quot;Huadanosaurus&quot;, &quot;Huaxiagnathus&quot; and &quot;Sinocalliopteryx&quot;) in addition to &quot;Mirischia&quot;. Their phylogenetic analyses using two separate datasets are reproduced below:

===Distinguishing anatomical features===
Ji and Ji (1996) identified many features that set &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; apart from other birds and dinosaurs. They found that it was a small primitive bird with a relatively high skull, blunt rostrum and a slightly high premaxilla; that the antorbital fenestra was elliptical but not enlarged, the dentary was robust, the surangular was narrow and elongated, and the dentition is extremely well developed and acute; that there are over 50 extremely elongated caudals, constituting 60% of the body length, and the forelimb is extremely short with a short and thick humerus; the pubis was elongated and extremely inflated at its distal end and the ischium is broad; the hind limb was long and robust, the tibia is only slightly longer than the femur, the tarsals are separated, and the metatarsals are relatively robust with unfused proximal ends; the feathers are short, small, and uniform; many ornament the top of the skull, cervical, and dorsal regions, in addition to the dorsal and ventral caudal region.

==Palaeobiology==
===Diet===
The specimen NIGP 127587 was preserved with the remains of a lizard in its gut region, indicating that small, fast-moving animals made up part of the diet of &quot;Sinosauropteryx prima&quot;. Numerous lizards of this type have been found in the same rocks as &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;. These lizards have been interpreted as most likely belonging to the genus &quot;Dalinghosaurus&quot;. &quot;Dalinghosaurus&quot; was probably a fast-running lizard adapted to living in open habitats, much like &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; itself.

The previously attributed &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; specimen GMV 2124 (&quot;Sinosauropteryx?&quot; sp.) was found with three mammal jaws in its gut region. Hurum, Luo, and Kielan-Jaworowska (2006) identified two of these jaws as belonging to &quot;Zhangheotherium&quot; and the third to &quot;Sinobaatar&quot;, showing that these two mammals were part of the animal&#x27;s diet. &quot;Zhangheotherium&quot; is known to have had a spur on the ankle, like the modern platypus, which would indicate that &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; fed on possibly venomous mammals. However, this specimen was later reclassified as a tyrannosauroid.

===Reproduction===
The same specimen of &quot;S. prima&quot; which had preserved a lizard in its stomach contents (NIGP 127587) also had several small eggs in its abdomen. Two eggs were preserved just in front of and above the pubic boot, and several more may lie underneath them on the slab. It is unlikely that they were eaten by the animal, as they are in the wrong part of the body cavity for the egg shells to have remained intact. It is more likely that they are unlaid eggs produced by the animal itself, proving the specimen to be a female. Each egg measured long by wide. The presence of two developed eggs suggests that &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; had dual oviducts and laid eggs in pairs, like other theropods.

==Palaeoecology==
&quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, as a Yixian Formation dinosaur, is a member of the Jehol Biota, the assemblage of organisms found in the Yixian Formation and overlying Jiufotang Formation. The Yixian Formation is composed largely of volcanic rocks such as andesite and basalt. Between the volcanic layers are several beds of sedimentary rocks representing deposition in a lake. The freshwater lake strata of the Yixian Formation have preserved a wide variety of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Gymnosperm forests were extensive, with a few early flowering plants as well. Ostracods and insects were diverse, and bivalves and gastropods were abundant. Mammals and birds are also well known from the formation. The setting was subject to periodic mortality events including volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and noxious gases erupting from the lakes. The climate has been interpreted as temperate, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The yearly temperature during this time period averaged about , indicating a temperate climate with unusually cold winters for the generally warm Mesozoic era, possibly due to northern China&#x27;s high latitude during this time.

<text>Drop Dead Gorgeous is a 1999 American satirical mockumentary black comedy film directed by Michael Patrick Jann and written by Lona Williams. It stars Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards, along with Brittany Murphy, Allison Janney and Amy Adams in her film debut. The film follows a small town beauty pageant and the fierce, deadly lengths the contestants will take to secure the crown.

Though the film was not a box office success and critical reviews were mixed, it has gained a following over time and has come to be regarded as a cult film.

==Plot==
In 1995, the small, conservative town of Mount Rose, Minnesota, is preparing for their annual local qualifying pageant for the national Sarah Rose Cosmetics American Teen Princess Pageant. A film crew is in town to document the pageant and its lead-up. One of the interviewees is 17-year-old Amber Atkins, who signs up for the pageant in the hopes of winning a college scholarship and following in the footsteps of her idol Diane Sawyer.

Among the other contestants are Rebecca &quot;Becky&quot; Leeman, the daughter of the richest man in town. Becky&#x27;s mother Gladys is the head of the pageant organizing committee and a former winner. Because of the business connections between the Leemans&#x27; furniture store and the pageant judges, many fear the contest will be rigged. In the days leading up to the pageant, many odd events occur around town, such as contestant Tammy Curry being killed when her threshing machine explodes, and the death of a boy Becky liked who was interested in Amber, which is ruled as a hunting accident. Amber considers dropping out when her mother Annette&#x27;s trailer explodes but remains in the competition to make her mother proud. At the dress rehearsal, a stage light knocks out contestant Jenelle Betz and renders her deaf.

On the night of the pageant, Amber&#x27;s dance costume disappears. She accuses Becky of stealing it and they have a fight backstage. Pageant choreographer Chloris Klinghagen gives Amber a new costume; however, organizer Gladys Leeman says she cannot perform as the new costume was not approved weeks earlier. Amber&#x27;s fellow contestant, Lisa Swenson, takes pity on her and drops out to give Amber her costume. Amber is able to perform her tap dance number and receives a standing ovation. For her performance, Becky sings &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; while dancing with a life-sized Jesus doll on a crucifix, which amuses and horrifies the audience.

The pageant announces the winners: cheerleader Leslie Miller is second runner-up, Amber is first runner-up, and Becky wins. During Becky&#x27;s victory parade the next day, she is killed in a freak accident when her elaborate swan float bursts into flames and explodes. A grief-stricken Gladys flies into a blind rage, admitting to being responsible for all the shenanigans, and is immediately arrested. Amber is crowned the new pageant winner. At the state competition, Amber wins the title by default after the other contestants contract food poisoning. She receives an all-expenses-paid trip to the national pageant as a prize, but upon arrival, she and the other state winners are devastated to find that Sarah Rose Cosmetics was shut down for tax evasion, meaning the national pageant has been permanently canceled. This sends all the contestants except Amber into a rage-fueled rampage where they vandalize the company&#x27;s property.

A few years later, Gladys escapes from prison and becomes involved in a police standoff at the Mount Rose supermarket, declaring her intent to take revenge on Amber. During the six-hour standoff, a television reporter at the scene is hit by a stray bullet. Amber quickly picks up the microphone and takes over to report the story, impressing the news station with her poise and confidence. Amber becomes co-anchor of the evening news for Minneapolis–St. Paul WAZB-TV, thus fulfilling her dream of possibly becoming the next Diane Sawyer.

==Cast==
==Background==
The movie is set in the fictional town of Mount Rose, Minnesota, which in turn is based on Rosemount where writer Lona Williams grew up. The film was originally titled &quot;Dairy Queens&quot; but was changed for legal reasons.

The characters in the movie all sport exaggerated, over-the-top parodies of Minnesota accents. The film was shot throughout the Carver County area, mainly in Waconia, Minnesota, although names of real Minnesota communities were shown on the sashes of contestants later in the movie.

News reporter Diane Sawyer is mentioned throughout the film as Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s character Amber Atkins&#x27;s idol, as Sawyer was a former beauty pageant winner. Amber&#x27;s other idols include her beauty pageant mother who raised her alone in a trailer park, and the previous year&#x27;s pageant winner who is hospitalized for anorexia. Competing in the beauty pageant for a scholarship is juxtaposed against the opportunities that boys have in leaving Mount Rose, such as hockey scholarships and prison.

Two Melissa Manchester songs are featured in the film as songs used in the talent portion by contestants. Mary lip-syncs &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Out Loud&quot;, while Jenelle sings and signs &quot;Through the Eyes of Love&quot;. Fanfare for the Common Man is played to introduce the parade for the rigged competition and the plight of Hank.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews. 

Allison Janney and Denise Richards in particular received praise for their performances from a number of critics. Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a fitfully amusing satire that would have gained a lot of mileage from just a tad more subtlety.&quot; Harvey said the writing is not sophisticated enough to pull off the some of the jokes without being condescending. He otherwise praised the pacing, the performances, and the clever visual casting. Roger Ebert liked the idea of the film, but wrote that the script failed to translate to the screen and was not funny enough, due to subtle miscalculations of production and performance.
Jeff Vice of the Deseret News criticized the film for being derivative, comparing it to the 1975 pageant comedy &quot;Smile&quot;, the 1996 film &quot;Fargo,&quot; and the mockumentary &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a D grade, and compared the film unfavorably to &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; grossed $10.6 million in the United States and Canada, against a budget of $15 million.

== Cult status ==
The film has gained new fans with time and is regarded as a cult film. In 2011, Allison Janney stated that she is approached by more fans of this film than for her Emmy-winning tenure on &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

In July 2019, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of its release, &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; was released for streaming for the first time on Hulu, which was &quot;met with a host of celebratory tweets, particularly among women and queer people, who have long recognized it as a cult classic&quot;, according to &quot;The Independent&#x27;s&quot; Adam White. It attracted retrospective praise from the likes of &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;E! News&quot;. The &quot;New Yorker&#x27;s&quot; Jia Tolentino credited the movie&#x27;s &quot;transformation&quot; from a flop to a &quot;venerated artifact of Y2K camp&quot; to its slow discovery on VHS and DVD by teenage girls who identified with its truthfulness and particular brand of dark humor. Tolentino summed up the movie as &quot;...offensive, for sure—completely awful, really, and possibly deadly. It is also irreplaceable, hilarious, surprisingly tender, and lavishly, magnificently absurd.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;vicious indecency&quot;, describing it as &quot;...trashy, wonderful, endlessly quotable, and...20 years ahead of its time.&quot;

Adam White further praised the movie&#x27;s radical departure from lighthearted teen movies of the late 1990s, stating that it &quot;was made for a generation of freaks and outsiders, whose ambitions, oddities, queerness and poverty were otherwise ignored by anything similarly mainstream or funny.&quot; He added that it was &quot;acidic and truthful about beauty, class and ambition, satirised all-American moralism and blew up Denise Richards, then fresh from &quot;Wild Things&quot;, as she rode a giant paper-maché swan.&quot; Alex Zaragoza of &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; echoed other reviews in praising the movie&#x27;s appeal to outsiders and misfits, and departing from the teen rom-com tropes of other movies released that year like &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot;. Zaragoza stated that the girls in &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t yearn to land their respective dream boy...they&#x27;re too busy trying not to get capped by a crazed mother–daughter duo... and striving to break out of the confines of their small town.&quot; He further described it as a &quot;wild, absurdly portrayed story that&#x27;s fundamentally about small-town struggles and overcoming the adversity of being born into a class that lacks opportunities to ultimately earn the life you&#x27;ve dreamed of for yourself. It&#x27;s unabashed weirdness and mockumentary-style filmmaking made it an immediate cult classic&quot;.

<text>Auricupride is a natural alloy that combines copper and gold. Its chemical formula is Cu3Au. The alloy crystallizes in the cubic crystal system in the L12 structure type and occurs as malleable grains or platey masses. It is an opaque yellow with a reddish tint. It has a hardness of 3.5 and a specific gravity of 11.5.

A variant called &quot;tetra-auricupride&quot; (CuAu) exists. Silver may be present resulting in the variety &quot;argentocuproauride&quot; ().

It was first described in 1950 for an occurrence in the Ural Mountains in Russia. It occurs as low temperature &quot;unmixing&quot; product in serpentinites and as reduction &quot;halos&quot; in redbed deposits. It is most often found in Chile, Argentina, Tasmania, Russia, Cyprus, Switzerland and South Africa.

<text>Baron Hamilton of Hameldon, of Hambledon in the County of Leicester, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain, held by the Duke of Hamilton from 1790 to 1799 and by the Duke of Argyll since 1799.

It was created in 1776 for Elizabeth Gunning (Duchess of Hamilton), wife since 1752 of James Douglas-Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton. The Duke of Hamilton died in 1758, and his widow remarried the following year, to John Campbell, who later became Marquess of Lorne in 1761 and 5th Duke of Argyll in 1770. She died in 1790, and her Barony passed to her only surviving son from her first marriage, the 8th Duke of Hamilton. On his death without male issue, the barony passed to his half-brother the Marquess of Lorne, the Duchess&#x27;s eldest surviving son by her second marriage. Lord Lorne succeeded his father as 6th Duke of Argyll in 1806, and the Barony of Hamilton has since remained united with that title.

The arms of Elizabeth Gunning, Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon, were her paternal arms of Gunning augmented with a fess ermine and ducal crowns for the doves: &quot;Gules, on a fess ermine between three doves argent ducally crowned or as many crosses pattée of the first&quot;.

<text>Katrina Laverne Kearse (née Taylor; born December 3, 1974), known professionally as Trina, is an American rapper. She rose to prominence in the late 1990s for her collaborations with Trick Daddy on the singles &quot;Nann Nigga&quot;, &quot;Shut Up&quot;, and &quot;Take It to da House&quot;. In 2000, she released her debut album &quot;Da Baddest Bitch&quot;. Afterwards, she made an appearance on the remix of &quot;One Minute Man&quot; by Missy Elliott and Ludacris. In 2002, she released the Kanye West-produced single &quot;B R Right&quot; featuring Ludacris, from her sophomore album &quot;Diamond Princess&quot; (2002).

Trina&#x27;s third album &quot;Glamorest Life&quot; (2005), spawned the hit single &quot;Here We Go&quot; featuring Kelly Rowland, which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her follow-up album &quot;Still da Baddest&quot; (2008), peaked within the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and reached number one on the US R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. In 2010, she released her fifth album &quot;Amazin&quot;&#x27;, which featured the Lady Gaga co-penned track &quot;Let Dem Hoes Fight&quot;, as well as collaborations with Diddy, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, and Rick Ross.

She has been described by &quot;XXL&quot; as &quot;the most consistent female rapper of all time&quot;. In 2014, Trina was included in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list of the &quot;31 Female Rappers Who Changed Hip-Hop&quot;.

== Early life ==
Katrina Laverne Taylor was born on December 3, 1974 in Miami and she grew up in the Liberty City area of the city. Her father is Dominican, while her mother, Vernessa Taylor, was Bahamian. They separated when Trina was a child. She attended Miami Northwestern Senior High School, where she was a majorette, and where she graduated. Taylor initially educated herself towards becoming a real estate agent, before switching her career path to music.

== Career ==
=== Breakthrough, &quot;Da Baddest Bitch&quot; (1998–2000) ===
In 1998, Trina was studying to get her real estate license, when she caught the attention of Miami rapper Trick Daddy, who asked her to appear on his track &quot;Nann Nigga&quot;. The song was released as the lead single from Trick&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;www.thug.com&quot; on July 14, 1998, reaching No. 62 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 3 on the Rap Songs chart. This kickstarted Trina&#x27;s rap career, leading to a record deal with Slip-n-Slide Records with distribution from Atlantic Records.

On March 21, 2000, Trina released her debut album &quot;Da Baddest Bitch&quot;, which debuted at No. 33 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 11 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for 39 weeks and on the Hip-Hop/R&amp;B album chart for 49 consecutive weeks and was certified Gold by the RIAA by November of that year. The album was preceded by the singles &quot;Da Baddest Bitch&quot; on December 22, 1999, and &quot;Pull Over&quot; on February 13, 2000, which reached No. 93 on the Hot 100, No. 46 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and No. 41 on the Rap Songs chart.

=== &quot;Diamond Princess&quot; (2001–2003) ===
Trina began working on her second studio album in 2001 with Missy Elliott, enjoying more creative control than ever before, saying in interviews that the album was &quot;more what Trina&#x27;s about, how Trina looks, how Trina feels, the things that Trina consists of.&quot; During this time, she started her own record label imprint, Diva Enterprises. In September 2002, she signed 9-year-old recording artist Lil&#x27; Brianna, who would appear on her track &quot;Kandi&quot; and later be known as Brianna Perry.

On August 27, 2002, Trina released her second studio album &quot;Diamond Princess&quot;, which debut at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 5 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling 67,000 units in its first week. The album was preceded by &quot;Told Y&#x27;all&quot;, featuring Rick Ross, which reached No. 64 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and appeared on the soundtrack to the action comedy &quot;All About the Benjamins&quot;, and &quot;No Panties&quot;, featuring Tweet, which reached No. 88 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and No. 45 on the UK Singles Chart. On October 22, 2002, Trina released the album&#x27;s third and final single, &quot;B R Right&quot;, featuring Ludacris, which reached No. 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 50 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and No. 24 on the Rap Songs chart.

=== &quot;Glamorest Life&quot; (2004–2005) ===
On October 4, 2005, Trina released her third studio album, &quot;Glamorest Life&quot;, which debut at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 2 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and No. 2 on the Top Rap Albums chart, selling 77,000 units in its first week. The album was preceded by the single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Trip&quot;, featuring Lil Wayne on April 28, 2005, which reached No. 74 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and &quot;Here We Go&quot;, featuring Kelly Rowland, on September 23, 2005, which became one of Trina&#x27;s most successful singles, reaching No. 17 on the Hot 100, No. 8 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and No. 3 on the Hot Rap Songs chart and Top 20 in most countries worldwide. The single was certified Gold in the US in June 2006. The album&#x27;s third and final single, &quot;Da Club&quot;, featuring Mannie Fresh, was released on November 22, 2005.

=== &quot;Still Da Baddest&quot; (2006–2008) ===

On May 18, 2007, it was announced that Trina had left Atlantic Records and signed to EMI in conjunction with her original label, Slip-n-Slide Records.

On April 1, 2008, Trina released her fourth studio album, &quot;Still da Baddest&quot;, which reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and No. 1 on the Top Rap Albums chart, becoming her first album to top the charts. Its first-week sales were 47,000. The album was preceded by the singles &quot;Single Again&quot;, which reached No. 25 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100, No. 59 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and No. 19 on the Rap Songs chart, and &quot;I Got a Thang for You&quot;, featuring Keyshia Cole, which reached No. 21 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 and No. 59 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

<text>William Howell Pegram (August 18, 1846 – April 30, 1928) was an American chemist and educator.

==Biography==
Born Chalk Level, Harnett County, North Carolina, Pegram fought in the American Civil War on the side of the Confederacy. His combat experience and subsequent internment on the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat left him with a military bearing and, untainted by cynicism, an enthusiasm to be part of the Reconstruction.

After spending the next four years on his father&#x27;s farm, he entered Trinity College (now Duke University) in 1869 and, even as an undergraduate, assisted in the teaching of science and English literature. Graduating in 1873, by 1874 he was professor of natural science with responsibility for the teaching of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. It was about this time that he began courting Emma, the daughter of college president Rev. Braxton Craven. As an uncredited report put it:

:&quot;In 1873 a bright young man, just out of college and full of the fine enthusiasm of youth was appointed to teach the sciences. It did not take him long to doff his coat, roll up his sleeves and resolve to make something happen. This youth was William H. Pegram. The records do not show whether this fine enthusiasm was fundamentally excited by a love of pure science or by a love of the President&#x27;s daughter. The fact is well-established, however, that through it he won the unqualified approval of the President and also of the President&#x27;s daughter, and thereby won for himself a career in science.&quot;

Pegram married Emma in 1875 and they parented five children, most famously George Braxton Pegram. Tight finances at the college demanded that Pegram was still teaching English until 1879 and it was not until 1900 that he could devote himself to his principle love of chemistry.

<text>USS &quot;Kimberly&quot; (DD-80) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. 
They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Kimberly&quot;, named for Lewis Ashfield Kimberly, was launched 14 December 1917, by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss Elsie S. Kimberly, daughter of Rear Admiral Kimberly; and commissioned 26 April 1918.

After shakedown &quot;Kimberly&quot; cleared Boston 19 May 1918, escorting a convoy to the United Kingdom. After her arrival in June, the destroyer spent the remainder of the war protecting ships bound for the battle zones in Europe from the British Isles. She departed Queenstown, Ireland, 26 December; and, after arrival Boston 8 January 1919, &quot;Kimberly&quot; engaged in training operations along the coast. In May the destroyer served as a lifeguard ship in New England waters during the world&#x27;s first transatlantic flight—that of the Navy&#x27;s NC-4 hydroplane commanded by Lt. Comdr. Albert C. Read.

In August 1918, &quot;Kimberly&quot;, with Undersecretary of the Navy Franklin D Roosevelt and the First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Eric Geddes on board, took a short cruise from Pembroke to Queenstown, escorted by the cruiser .

&quot;Kimberly&quot; completed maneuvers out of Newport, and entered Boston Navy Yard for extensive repairs. She joined the Destroyer Force at Newport 18 April 1921, and throughout the summer operated with submarines. Information gained through these early experiments was of great value in refining the techniques of undersea warfare. &quot;Kimberly&quot; spent the winter at Charleston, South Carolina, before arriving Philadelphia 29 March 1922, where she decommissioned 30 June. Her hull was sold to Boston Iron &amp; Metal Company, Baltimore, Maryland, for scrapping.

<text>Daniel Stewart Thomas Bingham Dixon, 2nd Baron Glentoran, KBE (19 January 1912 – 22 July 1995), was a Northern Irish soldier and politician.

Glentoran was the son of Herbert Dixon, 1st Baron Glentoran. After being educated at Eton and Sandhurst he was appointed aide-de-camp to the GOC in Northern Ireland in 1935. He served with the Grenadier Guards in World War II, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. In 1950 he succeeded his father as Baron Glentoran, as well being elected in his place as Ulster Unionist member for Belfast Bloomfield in the Northern Ireland House of Commons (where peers could also hold a seat).

Appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance in 1952, Lord Glentoran was the following year made Minister of Commerce, a post he held until elected to the Northern Ireland Senate in 1961. He was the Minister responsible for the destruction of much of the Great Northern Railway in Northern Ireland, when he unilaterally closed the Portadown – Armagh – Monaghan, Clones – Enniskillen -Belleek and Enniskillen – Omagh railway lines in 1957. Consequently, the privately owned Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway linking Enniskillen to Sligo was forced to close. He was then Minister in and Leader of the Senate for three years, becoming its last speaker in 1964.

Lord Glentoran was said to have had such a &quot;grand&quot; demeanour that once, when visiting America, a Texas newspaper carried the headline &quot;Irish royalty to visit Texas.&quot;

Appointed Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1973, Lord Glentoran was also the Lord Lieutenant (and from 1950 to 1976 Lieutenant) for Belfast from 1976 to 1985. In 1933 he married Lady Diana Mary Wellesley (died 1984), daughter of the third Earl Cowley, by whom he had three children; the eldest is Olympic gold medal-winning bobsledder Robin Dixon.

Lord Glentoran died in 1995 aged 83 and was succeeded to the Barony by his son Robin.

<doc id="871679" wikidata="Q2572330" url="?curid=871679" title="Ministry of National Education (France)">
<text>The Ministry of National Education and Youth, or simply Ministry of National Education, as the title has changed several times in the course of the Fifth Republic, is the cabinet member in the Government of France who oversees the country&#x27;s public educational system and supervises agreements and authorisations for private teaching organisations.

The ministry&#x27;s headquarters is located in the 18th century Hôtel de Rochechouart on the Rue de Grenelle in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. As education is France&#x27;s largest employment domain, the ministry directs the work of more than half of the state civil servants. The position is therefore traditionally a strategic one.

On 11 January 2024, with the installation of the Attal government, the ministry changed its name to (Ministry of National Education, Youth, Sports and the Olympic and Paralympic Games). During the second cabinet reshuffle of February 2024, and owing to a controversy involving Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, the ministry was divided into two: Oudéa-Castéra kept the Ministry of Sports and Olympic and Paralympic Games title, while the Ministry of Education was assigned to Nicole Belloubet. After the 2024 French legislative election, Anne Genetet was appointed Minister of National Education on 21 September 2024. She was succeeded by Élisabeth Borne in December 2024 during the formation of the Bayrou government.

==History==
A governmental position overseeing public education was first created in France in 1802. Following the various regime changes in France in the first decades of the 19th century, the position changed official status and name a number of times before the position of Minister of Public Instruction was created in 1828. For much of its history, the position was combined with that of Minister of Public Worship, who dealt with issues related to the Roman Catholic Church, except in instances where the Minister of Public Instruction was a Protestant. The position has also occasionally been combined with Minister of Sports and Minister of Youth Affairs. In 1932, the office&#x27;s title was changed to Minister of National Education, although it was briefly changed back in 1940–1941, and was renamed Minister of Education during the presidency of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing (1974–1981). In 1975, it created the &quot;Comité d&#x27;études sur les formations d&#x27;ingénieurs&quot; which studies the training and job placement of engineers in France.

However, while problems associated with &quot;mixture distributions&quot; relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, &quot;mixture models&quot; are used to make statistical inferences about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information. Mixture models are used for clustering, under the name model-based clustering, and also for density estimation.

Mixture models should not be confused with models for compositional data, i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the total size reading population has been normalized to 1.

==Structure==

===General mixture model===
A typical finite-dimensional mixture model is a hierarchical model consisting of the following components:

*&quot;N&quot; random variables that are observed, each distributed according to a mixture of &quot;K&quot; components, with the components belonging to the same parametric family of distributions (e.g., all normal, all Zipfian, etc.) but with different parameters
*&quot;N&quot; random latent variables specifying the identity of the mixture component of each observation, each distributed according to a &quot;K&quot;-dimensional categorical distribution
*A set of &quot;K&quot; mixture weights, which are probabilities that sum to 1.
*A set of &quot;K&quot; parameters, each specifying the parameter of the corresponding mixture component. In many cases, each &quot;parameter&quot; is actually a set of parameters. For example, if the mixture components are Gaussian distributions, there will be a mean and variance for each component. If the mixture components are categorical distributions (e.g., when each observation is a token from a finite alphabet of size &quot;V&quot;), there will be a vector of &quot;V&quot; probabilities summing to 1.

In addition, in a Bayesian setting, the mixture weights and parameters will themselves be random variables, and prior distributions will be placed over the variables. In such a case, the weights are typically viewed as a &quot;K&quot;-dimensional random vector drawn from a Dirichlet distribution (the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution), and the parameters will be distributed according to their respective conjugate priors.

Mathematically, a basic parametric mixture model can be described as follows:

:formula_1

In a Bayesian setting, all parameters are associated with random variables, as follows:

:formula_2

This characterization uses &quot;F&quot; and &quot;H&quot; to describe arbitrary distributions over observations and parameters, respectively. Typically &quot;H&quot; will be the conjugate prior of &quot;F&quot;. The two most common choices of &quot;F&quot; are Gaussian aka &quot;normal&quot; (for real-valued observations) and categorical (for discrete observations). Other common possibilities for the distribution of the mixture components are:
*Binomial distribution, for the number of &quot;positive occurrences&quot; (e.g., successes, yes votes, etc.) given a fixed number of total occurrences
*Multinomial distribution, similar to the binomial distribution, but for counts of multi-way occurrences (e.g., yes/no/maybe in a survey)
*Negative binomial distribution, for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before a given number of successes occurs
*Poisson distribution, for the number of occurrences of an event in a given period of time, for an event that is characterized by a fixed rate of occurrence
*Exponential distribution, for the time before the next event occurs, for an event that is characterized by a fixed rate of occurrence
*Log-normal distribution, for positive real numbers that are assumed to grow exponentially, such as incomes or prices
*Multivariate normal distribution (aka multivariate Gaussian distribution), for vectors of correlated outcomes that are individually Gaussian-distributed
*Multivariate Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution, for vectors of heavy-tailed correlated outcomes
*A vector of Bernoulli-distributed values, corresponding, e.g., to a black-and-white image, with each value representing a pixel; see the handwriting-recognition example below

===Specific examples===

====Gaussian mixture model====
A typical non-Bayesian Gaussian mixture model looks like this:

:formula_3


A Bayesian version of a Gaussian mixture model is as follows:

:formula_4formula_5
====Multivariate Gaussian mixture model====
A Bayesian Gaussian mixture model is commonly extended to fit a vector of unknown parameters (denoted in bold), or multivariate normal distributions. In a multivariate distribution (i.e. one modelling a vector formula_6 with &quot;N&quot; random variables) one may model a vector of parameters (such as several observations of a signal or patches within an image) using a Gaussian mixture model prior distribution on the vector of estimates given by
:formula_7
where the &quot;ith&quot; vector component is characterized by normal distributions with weights formula_8, means formula_9 and covariance matrices formula_10. To incorporate this prior into a Bayesian estimation, the prior is multiplied with the known distribution formula_11 of the data formula_6 conditioned on the parameters formula_13 to be estimated. With this formulation, the posterior distribution formula_14 is &quot;also&quot; a Gaussian mixture model of the form 
:formula_15
with new parameters formula_16 and formula_17 that are updated using the EM algorithm.
 Although EM-based parameter updates are well-established, providing the initial estimates for these parameters is currently an area of active research. Note that this formulation yields a closed-form solution to the complete posterior distribution. Estimations of the random variable formula_13 may be obtained via one of several estimators, such as the mean or maximum of the posterior distribution.

Such distributions are useful for assuming patch-wise shapes of images and clusters, for example. In the case of image representation, each Gaussian may be tilted, expanded, and warped according to the covariance matrices formula_10. One Gaussian distribution of the set is fit to each patch (usually of size 8x8 pixels) in the image. Notably, any distribution of points around a cluster (see &quot;k&quot;-means) may be accurately given enough Gaussian components, but scarcely over &quot;K&quot;=20 components are needed to accurately model a given image distribution or cluster of data.

====Categorical mixture model====
A typical non-Bayesian mixture model with categorical observations looks like this:

*formula_20 as above
*formula_21 as above
*formula_22 as above
*formula_23 dimension of categorical observations, e.g., size of word vocabulary
*formula_24 probability for component formula_25 of observing item formula_26
*formula_27 vector of dimension formula_28 composed of formula_29 must sum to 1

==Examples==

===A financial model===

Financial returns often behave differently in normal situations and during crisis times. A mixture model for return data seems reasonable. Sometimes the model used is a jump-diffusion model, or as a mixture of two normal distributions. See and for further context.

===House prices===
Assume that we observe the prices of &quot;N&quot; different houses. Different types of houses in different neighborhoods will have vastly different prices, but the price of a particular type of house in a particular neighborhood (e.g., three-bedroom house in moderately upscale neighborhood) will tend to cluster fairly closely around the mean. One possible model of such prices would be to assume that the prices are accurately described by a mixture model with &quot;K&quot; different components, each distributed as a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance, with each component specifying a particular combination of house type/neighborhood. Fitting this model to observed prices, e.g., using the expectation-maximization algorithm, would tend to cluster the prices according to house type/neighborhood and reveal the spread of prices in each type/neighborhood. (Note that for values such as prices or incomes that are guaranteed to be positive and which tend to grow exponentially, a log-normal distribution might actually be a better model than a normal distribution.)

===Topics in a document===
Assume that a document is composed of &quot;N&quot; different words from a total vocabulary of size &quot;V&quot;, where each word corresponds to one of &quot;K&quot; possible topics. The distribution of such words could be modelled as a mixture of &quot;K&quot; different &quot;V&quot;-dimensional categorical distributions. A model of this sort is commonly termed a topic model. Note that expectation maximization applied to such a model will typically fail to produce realistic results, due (among other things) to the excessive number of parameters. Some sorts of additional assumptions are typically necessary to get good results. Typically two sorts of additional components are added to the model:
#A prior distribution is placed over the parameters describing the topic distributions, using a Dirichlet distribution with a concentration parameter that is set significantly below 1, so as to encourage sparse distributions (where only a small number of words have significantly non-zero probabilities).
#Some sort of additional constraint is placed over the topic identities of words, to take advantage of natural clustering.
#*For example, a Markov chain could be placed on the topic identities (i.e., the latent variables specifying the mixture component of each observation), corresponding to the fact that nearby words belong to similar topics. (This results in a hidden Markov model, specifically one where a prior distribution is placed over state transitions that favors transitions that stay in the same state.)
#*Another possibility is the latent Dirichlet allocation model, which divides up the words into &quot;D&quot; different documents and assumes that in each document only a small number of topics occur with any frequency.

===Handwriting recognition===
The following example is based on an example in Christopher M. Bishop, &quot;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&quot;.

Imagine that we are given an &quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot; black-and-white image that is known to be a scan of a hand-written digit between 0 and 9, but we don&#x27;t know which digit is written. We can create a mixture model with formula_46 different components, where each component is a vector of size formula_47 of Bernoulli distributions (one per pixel). Such a model can be trained with the expectation-maximization algorithm on an unlabeled set of hand-written digits, and will effectively cluster the images according to the digit being written. The same model could then be used to recognize the digit of another image simply by holding the parameters constant, computing the probability of the new image for each possible digit (a trivial calculation), and returning the digit that generated the highest probability.

===Assessing projectile accuracy (a.k.a. circular error probable, CEP)===
Mixture models apply in the problem of directing multiple projectiles at a target (as in air, land, or sea defense applications), where the physical and/or statistical characteristics of the projectiles differ within the multiple projectiles. An example might be shots from multiple munitions types or shots from multiple locations directed at one target. The combination of projectile types may be characterized as a Gaussian mixture model. Further, a well-known measure of accuracy for a group of projectiles is the circular error probable (CEP), which is the number &quot;R&quot; such that, on average, half of the group of projectiles falls within the circle of radius &quot;R&quot; about the target point. The mixture model can be used to determine (or estimate) the value &quot;R&quot;. The mixture model properly captures the different types of projectiles.

===Direct and indirect applications===
The financial example above is one direct application of the mixture model, a situation in which we assume an underlying mechanism so that each observation belongs to one of some number of different sources or categories. This underlying mechanism may or may not, however, be observable. In this form of mixture, each of the sources is described by a component probability density function, and its mixture weight is the probability that an observation comes from this component.

In an indirect application of the mixture model we do not assume such a mechanism. The mixture model is simply used for its mathematical flexibilities. For example, a mixture of two normal distributions with different means may result in a density with two modes, which is not modeled by standard parametric distributions. Another example is given by the possibility of mixture distributions to model fatter tails than the basic Gaussian ones, so as to be a candidate for modeling more extreme events. 

===Predictive Maintenance===
The mixture model-based clustering is also predominantly used in identifying the state of the machine in predictive maintenance. Density plots are used to analyze the density of high dimensional features. If multi-model densities are observed, then it is assumed that a finite set of densities are formed by a finite set of normal mixtures. A multivariate Gaussian mixture model is used to cluster the feature data into k number of groups where k represents each state of the machine. The machine state can be a normal state, power off state, or faulty state. Each formed cluster can be diagnosed using techniques such as spectral analysis. In the recent years, this has also been widely used in other areas such as early fault detection.

===Fuzzy image segmentation===

In image processing and computer vision, traditional image segmentation models often assign to one pixel only one exclusive pattern. In fuzzy or soft segmentation, any pattern can have certain &quot;ownership&quot; over any single pixel. If the patterns are Gaussian, fuzzy segmentation naturally results in Gaussian mixtures. Combined with other analytic or geometric tools (e.g., phase transitions over diffusive boundaries), such spatially regularized mixture models could lead to more realistic and computationally efficient segmentation methods.

===Point set registration===
Probabilistic mixture models such as Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are used to resolve point set registration problems in image processing and computer vision fields. For pair-wise point set registration, one point set is regarded as the centroids of mixture models, and the other point set is regarded as data points (observations). State-of-the-art methods are e.g. coherent point drift (CPD) 
and Student&#x27;s t-distribution mixture models (TMM). 
The result of recent research demonstrate the superiority of hybrid mixture models 
(e.g. combining Student&#x27;s t-distribution and Watson distribution/Bingham distribution to model spatial positions and axes orientations separately) compare to CPD and TMM, in terms of inherent robustness, accuracy and discriminative capacity.

== Identifiability ==

Identifiability refers to the existence of a unique characterization for any one of the models in the class (family) being considered. Estimation procedures may not be well-defined and asymptotic theory may not hold if a model is not identifiable.

=== Example ===
Let be the class of all binomial distributions with . Then a mixture of two members of would have

formula_48

and . Clearly, given and , it is not possible to determine the above mixture model uniquely, as there are three parameters to be determined.

=== Definition ===
Consider a mixture of parametric distributions of the same class. Let

formula_49

be the class of all component distributions. Then the convex hull of defines the class of all finite mixture of distributions in :

formula_50

 is said to be identifiable if all its members are unique, that is, given two members and in &quot;K&quot;, being mixtures of distributions and distributions respectively in , we have if and only if, first of all, and secondly we can reorder the summations such that and for all .

== Parameter estimation and system identification ==

Parametric mixture models are often used when we know the distribution &quot;Y&quot; and we can sample from &quot;X&quot;, but we would like to determine the &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;θi&quot; values. Such situations can arise in studies in which we sample from a population that is composed of several distinct subpopulations.

It is common to think of probability mixture modeling as a missing data problem. One way to understand this is to assume that the data points under consideration have &quot;membership&quot; in one of the distributions we are using to model the data. When we start, this membership is unknown, or missing. The job of estimation is to devise appropriate parameters for the model functions we choose, with the connection to the data points being represented as their membership in the individual model distributions.

A variety of approaches to the problem of mixture decomposition have been proposed, many of which focus on maximum likelihood methods such as expectation maximization (EM) or maximum &quot;a posteriori&quot; estimation (MAP). Generally these methods consider separately the questions of system identification and parameter estimation; methods to determine the number and functional form of components within a mixture are distinguished from methods to estimate the corresponding parameter values. Some notable departures are the graphical methods as outlined in Tarter and Lock and more recently minimum message length (MML) techniques such as Figueiredo and Jain and to some extent the moment matching pattern analysis routines suggested by McWilliam and Loh (2009).

=== Expectation maximization (EM) === 

Expectation maximization (EM) is seemingly the most popular technique used to determine the parameters of a mixture with an &quot;a priori&quot; given number of components. This is a particular way of implementing maximum likelihood estimation for this problem. EM is of particular appeal for finite normal mixtures where closed-form expressions are possible such as in the following iterative algorithm by Dempster &quot;et al.&quot; (1977)

:formula_51
:formula_52
:formula_53
with the posterior probabilities
:formula_54

Thus on the basis of the current estimate for the parameters, the conditional probability for a given observation &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) being generated from state &quot;s&quot; is determined for each ; &quot;N&quot; being the sample size. The parameters are then updated such that the new component weights correspond to the average conditional probability and each component mean and covariance is the component specific weighted average of the mean and covariance of the entire sample.

Dempster also showed that each successive EM iteration will not decrease the likelihood, a property not shared by other gradient based maximization techniques. Moreover, EM naturally embeds within it constraints on the probability vector, and for sufficiently large sample sizes positive definiteness of the covariance iterates. This is a key advantage since explicitly constrained methods incur extra computational costs to check and maintain appropriate values. Theoretically EM is a first-order algorithm and as such converges slowly to a fixed-point solution. Redner and Walker (1984) make this point arguing in favour of superlinear and second order Newton and quasi-Newton methods and reporting slow convergence in EM on the basis of their empirical tests. They do concede that convergence in likelihood was rapid even if convergence in the parameter values themselves was not. The relative merits of EM and other algorithms vis-à-vis convergence have been discussed in other literature.

Other common objections to the use of EM are that it has a propensity to spuriously identify local maxima, as well as displaying sensitivity to initial values. One may address these problems by evaluating EM at several initial points in the parameter space but this is computationally costly and other approaches, such as the annealing EM method of Udea and Nakano (1998) (in which the initial components are essentially forced to overlap, providing a less heterogeneous basis for initial guesses), may be preferable.

Figueiredo and Jain note that convergence to &#x27;meaningless&#x27; parameter values obtained at the boundary (where regularity conditions breakdown, e.g., Ghosh and Sen (1985)) is frequently observed when the number of model components exceeds the optimal/true one. On this basis they suggest a unified approach to estimation and identification in which the initial &quot;n&quot; is chosen to greatly exceed the expected optimal value. Their optimization routine is constructed via a minimum message length (MML) criterion that effectively eliminates a candidate component if there is insufficient information to support it. In this way it is possible to systematize reductions in &quot;n&quot; and consider estimation and identification jointly.

==== The expectation step ====
With initial guesses for the parameters of our mixture model, &quot;partial membership&quot; of each data point in each constituent distribution is computed by calculating expectation values for the membership variables of each data point. That is, for each data point &quot;xj&quot; and distribution &quot;Yi&quot;, the membership value &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; is:

:formula_55

==== The maximization step ====
With expectation values in hand for group membership, plug-in estimates are recomputed for the distribution parameters.

The mixing coefficients &quot;ai&quot; are the means of the membership values over the &quot;N&quot; data points.

:formula_56

The component model parameters &quot;θi&quot; are also calculated by expectation maximization using data points &quot;xj&quot; that have been weighted using the membership values. For example, if &quot;θ&quot; is a mean &quot;μ&quot;

:formula_57

With new estimates for &quot;ai&quot; and the &quot;θi&quot;&#x27;s, the expectation step is repeated to recompute new membership values. The entire procedure is repeated until model parameters converge.

=== Markov chain Monte Carlo ===
As an alternative to the EM algorithm, the mixture model parameters can be deduced using posterior sampling as indicated by Bayes&#x27; theorem. This is still regarded as an incomplete data problem in which membership of data points is the missing data. A two-step iterative procedure known as Gibbs sampling can be used.

The previous example of a mixture of two Gaussian distributions can demonstrate how the method works. As before, initial guesses of the parameters for the mixture model are made. Instead of computing partial memberships for each elemental distribution, a membership value for each data point is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution (that is, it will be assigned to either the first or the second Gaussian). The Bernoulli parameter &quot;θ&quot; is determined for each data point on the basis of one of the constituent distributions. Draws from the distribution generate membership associations for each data point. Plug-in estimators can then be used as in the M step of EM to generate a new set of mixture model parameters, and the binomial draw step repeated.

=== Moment matching ===
The method of moment matching is one of the oldest techniques for determining the mixture parameters dating back to Karl Pearson&#x27;s seminal work of 1894.
In this approach the parameters of the mixture are determined such that the composite distribution has moments matching some given value. In many instances extraction of solutions to the moment equations may present non-trivial algebraic or computational problems. Moreover, numerical analysis by Day has indicated that such methods may be inefficient compared to EM. Nonetheless, there has been renewed interest in this method, e.g., Craigmile and Titterington (1998) and Wang.

McWilliam and Loh (2009) consider the characterisation of a hyper-cuboid normal mixture copula in large dimensional systems for which EM would be computationally prohibitive. Here a pattern analysis routine is used to generate multivariate tail-dependencies consistent with a set of univariate and (in some sense) bivariate moments. The performance of this method is then evaluated using equity log-return data with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test statistics suggesting a good descriptive fit.

===Spectral method===
Some problems in mixture model estimation can be solved using spectral methods.
In particular it becomes useful if data points &quot;xi&quot; are points in high-dimensional real space, and the hidden distributions are known to be log-concave (such as Gaussian distribution or Exponential distribution).

Spectral methods of learning mixture models are based on the use of Singular Value Decomposition of a matrix which contains data points.
The idea is to consider the top &quot;k&quot; singular vectors, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of distributions to be learned. The projection
of each data point to a linear subspace spanned by those vectors groups points originating from the same distribution
very close together, while points from different distributions stay far apart.

One distinctive feature of the spectral method is that it allows us to prove that if
distributions satisfy certain separation condition (e.g., not too close), then the estimated mixture will be very close to the true one with high probability.

=== Graphical Methods ===

Tarter and Lock describe a graphical approach to mixture identification in which a kernel function is applied to an empirical frequency plot so to reduce intra-component variance. In this way one may more readily identify components having differing means. While this &quot;λ&quot;-method does not require prior knowledge of the number or functional form of the components its success does rely on the choice of the kernel parameters which to some extent implicitly embeds assumptions about the component structure.

=== Other methods ===

Some of them can even probably learn mixtures of heavy-tailed distributions including those with
infinite variance (see links to papers below).
In this setting, EM based methods would not work, since the Expectation step would diverge due to presence of
outliers.

=== A simulation ===
To simulate a sample of size &quot;N&quot; that is from a mixture of distributions &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;i&quot;=1 to &quot;n&quot;, with probabilities &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; (sum= &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 1):
# Generate &quot;N&quot; random numbers from a categorical distribution of size &quot;n&quot; and probabilities &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot;= 1= to &quot;n&quot;. These tell you which of the &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot; each of the &quot;N&quot; values will come from. Denote by &quot;mi&quot; the quantity of random numbers assigned to the &quot;i&quot;th category.
# For each &quot;i&quot;, generate &quot;mi&quot; random numbers from the &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot; distribution.

== Extensions ==
In a Bayesian setting, additional levels can be added to the graphical model defining the mixture model. For example, in the common latent Dirichlet allocation topic model, the observations are sets of words drawn from &quot;D&quot; different documents and the &quot;K&quot; mixture components represent topics that are shared across documents. Each document has a different set of mixture weights, which specify the topics prevalent in that document. All sets of mixture weights share common hyperparameters.

A very common extension is to connect the latent variables defining the mixture component identities into a Markov chain, instead of assuming that they are independent identically distributed random variables. The resulting model is termed a hidden Markov model and is one of the most common sequential hierarchical models. Numerous extensions of hidden Markov models have been developed; see the resulting article for more information.

== History ==
Mixture distributions and the problem of mixture decomposition, that is the identification of its constituent components and the parameters thereof, has been cited in the literature as far back as 1846 (Quetelet in McLachlan, 2000) although common reference is made to the work of Karl Pearson (1894) as the first author to explicitly address the decomposition problem in characterising non-normal attributes of forehead to body length ratios in female shore crab populations. The motivation for this work was provided by the zoologist Walter Frank Raphael Weldon who had speculated in 1893 (in Tarter and Lock) that asymmetry in the histogram of these ratios could signal evolutionary divergence. Pearson&#x27;s approach was to fit a univariate mixture of two normals to the data by choosing the five parameters of the mixture such that the empirical moments matched that of the model.

While his work was successful in identifying two potentially distinct sub-populations and in demonstrating the flexibility of mixtures as a moment matching tool, the formulation required the solution of a 9th degree (nonic) polynomial which at the time posed a significant computational challenge.

Subsequent works focused on addressing these problems, but it was not until the advent of the modern computer and the popularisation of Maximum Likelihood (MLE) parameterisation techniques that research really took off. Since that time there has been a vast body of research on the subject spanning areas such as fisheries research, agriculture, botany, economics, medicine, genetics, psychology, palaeontology, electrophoresis, finance, geology and zoology.

<doc id="871687" wikidata="Q6407805" url="?curid=871687" title="Killing spinor">
<text>Killing [[spinor]] is a term used in mathematics and physics. 

== Definition ==
By the more narrow definition, commonly used in mathematics, the term Killing spinor indicates those twistor
spinors which are also eigenspinors of the Dirac operator. The term is named after Wilhelm Killing.

Another equivalent definition is that Killing spinors are the solutions to the Killing equation for a so-called Killing number.

More formally:

:A Killing spinor on a Riemannian spin manifold &quot;M&quot; is a spinor field formula_1 which satisfies

::formula_2

:for all tangent vectors &quot;X&quot;, where formula_3 is the spinor covariant derivative, formula_4 is Clifford multiplication and formula_5 is a constant, called the Killing number of formula_1. If formula_7 then the spinor is called a parallel spinor.

== Applications ==
In physics, Killing spinors are used in supergravity and superstring theory, in particular for finding solutions which preserve some supersymmetry. They are a special kind of spinor field related to Killing vector fields and Killing tensors.

== Properties ==
If formula_8 is a manifold with a Killing spinor, then formula_8 is an Einstein manifold with Ricci curvature formula_10, where formula_11 is the Killing constant. 
===Types of Killing spinor fields===
If formula_11 is purely imaginary, then formula_8 is a noncompact manifold; if formula_11 is 0, then the spinor field is parallel; finally, if formula_11 is real, then formula_8 is compact, and the spinor field is called a ``real spinor field.&quot;

<text>Yourself or Someone Like You is the debut album by American rock band Matchbox 20. It was released on October 1, 1996, by Lava Records and Atlantic Records. The album has been certified 12× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

==Composition and release==
The album features a sound similar to traditional rock and post-grunge. The album features themes of adolescence, adultery, loneliness, domestic violence, psychological abuse, humiliation, depression, anger, and alcoholism.

According to Rob Thomas, the album&#x27;s title was originally to be &quot;Woodshed Diaries&quot;. However, that changed when Thomas and Paul Doucette were at a woman&#x27;s musical performance at Café Largo when the singer said &quot;this song is for you, or someone like you&quot;. They loved the phrase so much that they insisted on changing the album&#x27;s title, despite the fact that 3,500 copies of the album with the original title had already been made. Their labels agreed; however, the name change resulted in the album&#x27;s release being delayed.

The album sold a mere 610 copies in its first week; however, it eventually went on to sell several million copies in the United States. &quot;Yourself or Someone Like You&quot; became one of the few albums to achieve the prestigious Diamond certification, and it was also certified multi-platinum in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. To date, the album has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.

==Artwork lawsuit==
In 2005, almost a decade after the album&#x27;s release, the band was sued by Frank Torres, the man on the album&#x27;s cover. Torres claimed the band never asked for his permission to use his image on the sleeve. In the litigation, Torres claimed the photo was taken as he was walking down the street after being asked to pose. He also claimed the photo had caused him emotional distress. Torres justified the delay in suing Matchbox 20 by claiming he had first seen the album photo within two years of the litigation. Torres died in 2016 at age 73.

<doc id="871693" wikidata="Q6208106" url="?curid=871693" title="Jody Lynn Nye">
<text>Jody Lynn Nye (born 1957) is an American science fiction writer. She is the author or co-author of approximately forty published novels and more than 100 short stories. She has specialized in science fiction or fantasy action novels and humor. Her humorous series range from contemporary fantasy (&quot;The Magic Touch&quot; and &quot;Mythology 101&quot;) to military science fiction (&quot;Strong Arm Tactics&quot; and a new series beginning with &quot;View from the Imperium&quot;). About one-third of her novels are collaborations, either as a co-author or as the author of a sequel. She has been an instructor of the Fantasy Writing Workshop at Columbia College Chicago (2007) and she teaches the annual Science Fiction Writing Workshop at DragonCon.

Nye began collaborating with Robert Lynn Asprin on the MythAdventures series in 2003 with the publication of the collection &quot;Myth-told Tales&quot; and the novel &quot;Myth Alliances&quot;. Since Asprin&#x27;s death in 2008 she has continued that humorous fantasy series and she is now also writing sequels to his Dragons, or Griffen McCandles, contemporary fantasy series.

In 2008 she donated her archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Northern Illinois University Libraries.

==Career==
Born 1957 in Chicago, Illinois, Nye says that she &quot;always told stories&quot; to her younger brothers, cousins, and friends, and as a junior camp counselor. Her first published writings were technical articles on broadcasting in the magazine &quot;Video Action&quot; during the 1980s. She first wrote fiction for the &quot;Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine game&quot; and the Role-Aids line of game supplements published by Mayfair Games.

Late in the eighties Nye wrote six companion books for the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series by Anne McCaffrey and the &quot;Magic of Xanth&quot; series by Piers Anthony. The first four were &quot;branching-path&quot; gamebooks in the &quot;Crossroads Adventure&quot; series, two set on Pern and two in Xanth. Then simultaneously November 1989, Ballantine Books published &quot;The Dragonlover&#x27;s Guide to Pern&quot; by Nye with McCaffrey and Avon Books published &quot;Piers Anthony&#x27;s Visual Guide to Xanth&quot; by Nye and Anthony. Todd Cameron Hamilton and James Clouse were the illustrators for both Guides, as Hamilton had been for &quot;Roger Zelazny&#x27;s Visual Guide to Amber&quot; published by Avon one year earlier.

For the Pern guide, Nye explained in its introduction, her team (without Clouse) had visited McCaffrey two years earlier, for ten days during October 1987. In the living room Nye, editor Bill Fawcett (Nye&#x27;s husband), illustrator Hamilton, and McCaffrey&#x27;s son Todd Johnson discussed Pern with its creator and Hamilton sketched under her direction. They produced &quot;a companion volume to her work, intended to help you visualize the setting and background for her chronicles.&quot;

Before &quot;The Dragonlover&#x27;s Guide&quot; was finished, McCaffrey and Nye were working together on a novel, presumably &quot;The Death of Sleep&quot; (1990) in the Planet Pirates trilogy. In the early 1990s they collaborated in three series based on McCaffrey stories from the 1960s and 1970s. Meanwhile, McCaffrey completed five more Pern books, after which they revised &quot;The Dragonlover&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

Late in the 1990s Nye began work with Robert Asprin to extend the Myth Adventures series he had started in 1978. After his 2008 death she continued to write books they had planned. Meanwhile, three of Nye&#x27;s book series were &quot;adrift&quot; since Meisha Merlin Publishing went out of business in 2007.

Among other projects, Nye is continuing to write the Myth Adventures series and her military SF/humor series begun with &quot;View from the Imperium&quot; (2011).

<doc id="871694" wikidata="Q5428392" url="?curid=871694" title="Face the Music (British game show)">
<text>Face the Music is a British panel game show that originally aired on BBC2 from 26 December 1966 to 25 December 1979 and then moved to BBC1 from 17 April 1983 to 16 December 1984 with Joseph Cooper hosting the entire run.

The theme music for the show was the &quot;Popular Song&quot; from the &quot;Façade&quot; suite by Sir William Walton (who was a guest on the programme in his 70th birthday year). During its most popular period the programme had a weekly audience of over 4 million.

==Format==
The programme, chaired by Joseph Cooper, took the form of a quiz, with a panel of three music-loving celebrities, but without scoring or any winner. Each week there would be a special guest, who would also have to answer questions – with the focus being on topics that related to the guest&#x27;s life and career, so as to lead to amusing anecdotes. The questions to the panel were asked in a series of rounds, each with a theme, such as &quot;The Face, The Music&quot;, where the panel would have to identify a composer from their picture, as well as the composer of the music played along with it.

The most demanding round was the &quot;Dummy Keyboard&quot;, where Cooper would play a famous piece on a dummy (soundless) instrument, requiring the panel to identify it from hand movements alone. For the benefit of the audience at home, the music in question – which Cooper was hearing through earphones for the purpose of synchronisation – would be slowly faded in as the piece progressed.

Another round was &quot;Hidden Melody&quot; where Cooper would perform a popular tune in the style of a famous composer, while including extracts of works by that composer to help the listeners. Robin Ray, if a member of that week&#x27;s panel, would typically identify the opus number of the quoted works.

For opera lovers, the panel were shown a filmed performance of one opera with the soundtrack of a different one, and asked to identify both.

<doc id="871703" wikidata="Q1518496" url="?curid=871703" title="Minister of the Interior (France)">
<text>Minister of the Interior (, ) is a prominent position in the Government of France. The position is equivalent to the interior minister in other countries, like the Home Secretary in the United Kingdom, the Minister of Public Safety in Canada, or the Minister of Home Affairs in Australia.

== Responsibilities ==
The Minister of the Interior is responsible for the following:
* The general interior security of the country, with respect to criminal acts or natural catastrophes
** including the major law-enforcement forces
*** the National Police
*** the National Gendarmerie for its police operations since 2009; as a part of the French Armed Forces, the Gendarmerie is administratively under the purview of the Ministry of Armed Forces
** General directorate for civil defence and crisis management (Sécurité Civile)
*** the directorate of Firefighters (Sapeurs-Pompiers)
* the granting of identity documents (passports, identity cards) and driving licenses through the network of prefectures and subprefectures
* relations between the central government and local governments
* logistics and organisation of political elections, at the national and prefectoral levels; the results of the elections are overseen by the Constitutional Council or the administrative courts
* regulation of immigration and preventing illegal immigration
* integration of legal immigrants (professionally, linguistically, housing)
* all regional and departmental prefects and subprefects are subordinate to the Minister of the Interior

The Minister of the Interior also takes on the role of the former Minister of Worship and is formally consulted in the process of appointment of Catholic diocesan bishops (Briand-Ceretti Agreement). The Minister of Worship used to be a fully-fledged position; the office was abolished in 1912.

While the Ministry of the Interior supervises police forces, it does not supervise criminal enquiries. Those enquiries are conducted under the supervision of the judiciary.

== History==
The Minister for the Maison du Roi under the Ancien Régime is considered to be the precursor of the position of Minister of the Interior, which was officially established on 7 August 1790, during the French Revolution, when François-Emmanuel Guignard, comte de Saint-Priest became the inaugural officeholder. Although his tasks included the organisation of elections, relations with local authorities, agriculture, as well as trade, the Minister of the Interior&#x27;s main duty was to oversee the functioning of police forces. This has been the case since then, with the exception of the period from 1796 to 1818, when a Ministry of Police was in use, which was also briefly restored under the Second Empire.
During the First Empire, the Interior Ministry&#x27;s tasks were reduced; in 1824, the Ministry of Public Instruction was established to oversee France&#x27;s education policy. In 1832, the Interior Ministry was primarily occupied with the holding of elections and maintenance of the firefighters force, as the and national public libraries were transferred to the Public Instruction Ministry. In 1836, the Ministry of Public Works, Agriculture and Commerce was established.

In 1911, the Directorate of Penitentiary Administration, established in 1858 in the Interior Ministry to oversee prison conditions, was placed under the authority of the Minister of Justice. Nine years later, the Interior Ministry lost its public health policy department to the newly established Ministry of Hygiene, Assistance and Social Security.

==Location==
The ministry&#x27;s headquarters have been located on Place Beauvau, facing the Élysée Palace, since 1861. &quot;Place Beauvau&quot; is often used as a metonym for the ministry.

==Organisation==
The Minister of the Interior has been Gérald Darmanin since 6 July 2020. He succeeded Christophe Castaner, who was appointed to the office on 16 October 2018. Darmanin is assisted by Marlène Schiappa, who holds the junior title of Minister for Citizenship in the government of Prime Minister Jean Castex.

<doc id="871709" wikidata="Q2026918" url="?curid=871709" title="Don Hastings">
<text>Donald Francis Michael Hastings (born April 1, 1934) is an American television actor, singer, and writer. He is best known for his 50-year role as Dr. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hughes on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1960 to 2010). For his work on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, Hastings received an Editor&#x27;s Award at the Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1998 and a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004. In the 1940s, he appeared on Broadway in &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;, &quot;On Whitman Avenue&quot;, &quot;A Young Man&#x27;s Fancy&quot;, and &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;. He also starred as the Video Ranger on DuMont&#x27;s &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot; (1949 to 1955) and as Jack Lane on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (1956 to 1960). 

== Early life ==
Hastings was born on April 1, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York. He is the younger brother of actor Bob Hastings. His career began at six years old when he went to see his brother perform on a radio show. When the show&#x27;s producers learned that Hastings was also a singer, he was asked to audition. He won his first role, singing on the radio show &quot;Coast to Coast on a Bus&quot;.

==Career==
In 1941, Hastings joined a national tour of &quot;Life with Father&quot;. He traveled the U.S. with the company by train, from the age of seven until he was ten years old. He made his Broadway debut in &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1944). He then landed another Broadway role in &quot;On Whitman Avenue&quot;. He made his third appearance on Broadway as a replacement for the part of Grilly in &quot;A Young Man&#x27;s Fancy&quot; at the Plymouth Theatre. Hastings played Young John in the original Broadway production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;. The play opened at the Music Box Theatre on October 6, 1948. 

From 1949 to 1955, Hastings played Captain Video&#x27;s teenaged companion, the Video Ranger, on the DuMont television series, &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot;. He portrayed one of television&#x27;s first superheroes designed to appeal to children.

In the 1940s and 1950s, he made appearances on television and radio shows, including &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Magic Cottage&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Crunch and Des&quot;, &quot;A Date with Life&quot;, &quot;Modern Romances, The Road of Life, Hilltop House,&quot; &quot;Portia Faces Life,&quot; and &quot;Decoy.&quot;

In 1956, Hastings was cast as Jack Lane on the CBS soap opera, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;. He spoke the first line in the premiere episode of the series. He stayed on the show for four and a half years. In 1960, Irna Phillips, the head writer of the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, saw his work on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;. She thought he would be right for the role of Dr. Bob Hughes on &quot;ATWT&quot; and he was cast on the show. In the first week of October 1960, Hastings appeared in his last two episodes of &quot;The Edge of the Night&quot; and also aired in his first two episodes of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. The role of Bob had previously been played by a child actor, Bobby Alford, and one adult actor, Ronnie Welsh. In his early years on the show, he was paired romantically with Lisa Miller (Eileen Fulton), but he eventually found true love with Kim Sullivan (Kathryn Hays).

Hastings began writing sample scripts for the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; and submitting them to the show&#x27;s head writer, Harding Lemay. He then started writing for &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, working with Irna Phillips. He also wrote for &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. As a writer, Hastings used the pen name J.J. Matthews, a combination of his children&#x27;s names. He eventually decided to focus on acting because he found writing too stressful. 

In 1965, Hastings was offered a role as one of Macdonald Carey&#x27;s sons on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, but he declined because he was happy working on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. In 1977, he performed with his &quot;ATWT&quot; co-star, Kathryn Hays, in &quot;Hastings &amp; Hays On Love&quot;, an evening where they would chat and sing about love. In June 1978, they appeared together in &quot;Algonquin Sampler,&quot; a literary review performed at New York&#x27;s Joseph Jefferson Theater. In 1993, he received a Silver Circle Award from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences for his many years in the television industry. Hastings and Kathryn Hays won the Editor&#x27;s Award at the Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1998. He received a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004.

The cancellation of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was announced in December 2009. In the final episode, airing September 17, 2010, Dr. Bob Hughes retired from the hospital. Hastings spoke the final line of the series, &quot;Good Night.&quot; The show had opened in 1956 with Nancy Hughes (Helen Wagner) saying, &quot;Good morning, dear.&quot;

Hastings previously held the record as the longest &quot;continuous&quot; actor in the history of television serials until November 2010, shortly after &quot;As the World Turns&quot; ended. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; stated that the non-continuous record was held by Hastings&#x27; co-star Helen Wagner, who played Nancy Hughes from April 2, 1956, until her death in May 2010.

==Personal life==
Hastings married his first wife, Nan, in 1957. They had two daughters and a son. They later divorced.

He met actress Leslie Denniston when she briefly played Karen Peters on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. They were married in 1980. They have a daughter, who was born in 1982.

His son Matthew has been active in show business since 1999 as a writer, director, and producer.

His older brother, actor Bob Hastings, died in 2014, at the age of 89.

<doc id="871711" wikidata="Q1331042" url="?curid=871711" title="Limequat">
<text>The limequat (Citrus&quot; × &quot;floridana) is a citrus hybrid that is the result of a cross between the Key lime and the kumquat, hybridized by Walter Tennyson Swingle in 1909.

==Description==
It is a small tree that grows into a contained bushy form. The leaves are characteristically citrus-like. The limequat produces an abundance of fruit even at a young age. The fruit is small, oval, greenish-yellow and contains seeds or pips. It has a sweet-tasting skin and a bitter-sweet pulp with a flavor similar to limes. The fruit can be eaten whole or the juice and rind can be used to flavor drinks and dishes. It has considerable amounts of vitamin C and is highly acidic.

This plant is now grown in Japan, Israel, Spain, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States in California, Arizona, Florida, and Texas. The fruit can be found, in small quantities, during the fall and winter months in the United States, India and Japan.

Limequats can be grown indoors or outdoors providing the temperature stays between . They are fairly small and can be planted in containers or pots, in well-drained fertile soil. Plants grow fairly slowly and flower and fruit for 5–7 months, then rest for 5–7 months.

Limequats are more cold-hardy than limes but less cold-hardy than kumquats.

Limequats are used in cocktails and fruit salads, and can be candied whole. They can be cooked if the seeds are removed, as they impart a bitter taste, and they can also be made into conserves.

==Varieties==
There are three different named cultivars of limequats: 
*Eustis (&quot;Citrus japonica&quot; (synonym &quot;Fortunella japonica&quot;) × &quot;Citrus aurantiifolia&quot;) - Key lime crossed with round kumquat, the most common limequat. It was named after the city of Eustis, Florida.
*Lakeland (&quot;Citrus japonica&quot; × &quot;Citrus aurantiifolia&quot;) - Key lime crossed with round kumquat, different seed from same hybrid parent as Eustis. Fruit is slightly larger and contains a few fewer seeds than Eustis. It was named after the city of Lakeland, Florida.
*Tavares (&quot;Citrus japonica&quot; &#x27;Margarita&#x27; × &quot;Citrus aurantiifolia&quot;) - Key lime crossed with oval kumquat (though there is some speculation that it is actually a lemon/kumquat hybrid), fruit is larger and more elongated and color at maturity is more orange than other limequats. It was named after the city of Tavares, Florida.

<text>A glacial erratic is a glacially deposited rock differing from the type of rock native to the area in which it rests. Erratics, which take their name from the Latin word &quot;&quot; (&quot;to wander&quot;), are carried by glacial ice, often over distances of hundreds of kilometres. Erratics can range in size from pebbles to large boulders such as Big Rock (16,500 metric tons) in Alberta.

Geologists identify erratics by studying the rocks surrounding the position of the erratic and the composition of the erratic itself. Erratics are significant because:
*They can be transported by glaciers, and are thereby one of a series of indicators which mark the path of prehistoric glacier movement. Their lithographic origin can be traced to the parent bedrock, allowing for confirmation of the ice flow route.
*They can be transported by ice rafting, which allows quantification of the extent of glacial flooding resulting from ice dam failures which release the waters stored in proglacial lakes such as Lake Missoula. Erratics released by ice rafts that were stranded and subsequently melted, dropping their load, allow characterization of the high-water marks for transient floods in areas like temporary Lake Lewis.
*Erratics dropped by icebergs melting in the ocean can be used to track Antarctic and Arctic-region glacial movements for periods prior to record retention. Also known as dropstones, these can be correlated with ocean temperatures and levels to better understand and calibrate models of the global climate.

==Formation of erratics==

The term &quot;erratic&quot; is commonly used to refer to erratic blocks, which geologist Archibald Geikie describes as: &quot;large masses of rock, often as big as a house, that have been transported by glacier ice, and have been lodged in a prominent position in the glacier valleys or have been scattered over hills and plains. And examination of their mineralogical character leads the identification of their sources...&quot;. In geology, an erratic is material moved by geologic forces from one location to another, usually by a glacier.

Erratics are formed by glacial ice erosion resulting from the movement of ice. Glaciers erode by multiple processes including:

* Abrasion/Scouring – debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood, producing smaller glacial till.
* Plucking – pieces of bedrock are cracked off by glaciers, producing larger erratics.
* Ice thrusting – the glacier freezes to its bed, moving large sheets of frozen sediment at its base along with it.
* Glacially induced spalling – layers of rock are spalled off the rocks below the glacier during ice lens formation. This provides smaller debris, which is ground into the glacial basal material, to become till.
Evidence supports another possibility for the creation of erratics as well: rock avalanches onto the upper surface of the glacier (supraglacial). Rock avalanche–supraglacial transport occurs when the glacier undercuts a rock face, which fails by avalanche onto the upper surface of the glacier. The characteristics of rock avalanche–supraglacial transport includes:

:*Monolithologic composition – a cluster of boulders of similar composition are frequently found in close proximity. Commingling of the multiple lithologies normally present throughout the glaciated basin, has not occurred.
:*Angularity – the supraglacially transported rocks tend to be rough and irregular, with no sign of subglacial abrasion. The sides of boulders are roughly planar, suggesting that some surfaces may be original fracture planes.
:*Great size – the size distribution of the boulders tends to be skewed toward larger boulders than those produced subglacially.
:*Surficial positioning of the boulders – the boulders are positioned on the surface of glacial deposits, as opposed to partially or totally buried.
:*Restricted areal extents – the boulder fields tend to have limited areal extent; the boulders cluster together, consistent with the boulders landing on the surface of the glacier and subsequently deposited on top of the glacial drift.
:*Orientations – the boulders may be close enough that original fracture planes can be matched.
:*Locations of the boulder trains – the boulders appear in rows, trains or clusters along the lateral moraines as opposed to being located on the terminal moraine or in the general glacial field.

===Glacier-borne erratic===

Erratics provide an important tool in characterizing the directions of glacier flows, which are routinely reconstructed used on a combination of moraines, eskers, drumlins, meltwater channels and similar data. Erratic distributions and glacial till properties allow for identification of the source rock from which they derive, which confirms the flow direction, particularly when the erratic source outcrop is unique to a limited locality. Erratic materials may be transported by multiple glacier flows prior to their deposition, which can complicate the reconstruction of the glacial flow.

===Ice-rafted erratic===
Glacial ice entrains debris of varying sizes from small particles to extremely large masses of rock. This debris is transported to the coast by glacier ice and released during the production, drift and melting of icebergs. The rate of debris release by ice depends upon the size of the ice mass in which it is carried as well as the temperature of the ocean through which the ice floe passes.

Sediments from the late Pleistocene period lying on the floor of the North Atlantic show a series of layers (referred to as Heinrich layers) which contain ice-rafted debris. They were formed between 14,000 and 70,000 years before the present. The deposited debris can be traced back to the origin by both the nature of the materials released and the continuous path of debris release. Some paths extend more than distant from the point at which the ice floes originally broke free.

The location and altitude of ice-rafted boulders relative to the modern landscape has been used to identify the highest level of water in proglacial lakes (e.g. Lake Musselshell in central Montana) and temporary lakes (e.g. Lake Lewis in Washington state). Ice-rafted debris is deposited when the iceberg strands on the shore and subsequently melts, or drops out of the ice floe as it melts. Hence all erratic deposits are deposited below the actual high water level of the lake; however, the measured altitude of ice-rafted debris can be used to estimate the lake surface elevation.
This is accomplished by recognizing that on a fresh-water lake, the iceberg floats until the volume of its ice-rafted debris exceeds 5% of the volume of the iceberg. Therefore, a correlation between the iceberg size and the boulder size can be established. For example, a boulder can be carried by a iceberg and could be found stranded at higher elevations than a boulder, which requires a iceberg.

===Large erratics===
Large erratics consisting of slabs of bedrock that have been lifted and transported by glacier ice to subsequently be stranded above thin glacial or fluvioglacial deposits are referred to as glacial floes, rafts (schollen) or erratic megablocks. Erratic megablocks have typical length to thickness ratios on the order of 100 to 1. These megablocks may be found partially exposed or completely buried by till and are clearly allochthonous, since they overlay glacial till. Megablocks can be so large that they are mistaken for bedrock until underlying glacial or fluvial sediments are identified by drilling or excavation. Such erratic megablocks greater than in area and in thickness can be found on the Canadian Prairies, Poland, England, Denmark and Sweden. One erratic megablock located in Saskatchewan is (and up to thick). Their sources can be identified by locating the bedrock from which they were separated; several rafts from Poland and Alberta were determined to have been transported over from their source.

===Nonglacial erratics===
In geology an erratic is any material which is not native to the immediate locale but has been transported from elsewhere. The most common examples of erratics are associated with glacial transport, either by direct glacier-borne transport or by ice rafting. However, other erratics have been identified as the result of kelp holdfasts, which have been documented to transport rocks up to in diameter, rocks entangled in the roots of drifting logs, and even in transport of stones accumulated in the stomachs of pinnipeds during foraging.

==History==

During the 18th century, erratics were deemed a major geological paradox. Geologists identify erratics by studying the rocks surrounding the position of the erratic and the rock of the erratic itself. Erratics were once considered evidence of a biblical flood, but in the 19th century scientists gradually came to accept that erratics pointed to an ice age in Earth&#x27;s past. Among others, the Swiss politician, jurist and theologian saw glaciers as a possible solution as early as 1788. However, the idea of ice ages and glaciation as a geological force took a while to be accepted. Ignaz Venetz (1788–1859), a Swiss engineer, naturalist and glaciologist was one of the first scientists to recognize glaciers as a major force in shaping the earth.

In the 19th century, many scientists came to favor erratics as evidence for the end of the ice age 10,000 years ago, rather than a flood. Geologists have suggested that landslides or rockfalls initially dropped the rocks on top of glacial ice. The glaciers continued to move, carrying the rocks with them. When the ice melted, the erratics were left in their present locations.

Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; (v. 1, 1830) provided an early description of the erratic which is consistent with the modern understanding. Louis Agassiz was the first to scientifically propose that the Earth had been subject to a past ice age. In the same year, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Prior to this proposal, Goethe, de Saussure, Venetz, Jean de Charpentier, Karl Friedrich Schimper and others had made the glaciers of the Alps the subjects of special study, and Goethe, Charpentier as well as Schimper had even arrived at the conclusion that the erratic blocks of alpine rocks scattered over the slopes and summits of the Jura Mountains had been moved there by glaciers.

Charles Darwin published extensively on geologic phenomena including the distribution of erratic boulders. In his accounts written during the voyage of , Darwin observed a number of large erratic boulders of notable size south of the Strait of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego and attributed them to ice rafting from Antarctica. Recent research suggests that they are more likely the result of glacial ice flows carrying the boulders to their current locations.

===Flood-borne erratics===
If glacial ice is &quot;rafted&quot; by a flood such as that created when the ice dam broke during the Missoula floods, then the erratics are deposited where the ice finally releases its debris load. One of the more unusual examples is found far from its origin in Idaho at Erratic Rock State Natural Site just outside McMinnville, Oregon. The park includes a specimen, the largest erratic found in the Willamette Valley.

<text>Tarsus (; Hittite: 𒋫𒅈𒊭 ; ; ; ) is a municipality and district of Mersin Province, Turkey. Its area is 2,029 km2, and its population is 350,732 (2022). It is a historic city, inland from the Mediterranean Sea. It is part of the Adana-Mersin metropolitan area, the fourth-largest metropolitan area in Turkey. Tarsus forms an administrative district in the eastern part of Mersin Province and lies at the heart of the region.

With a history going back over 6,000 years, Tarsus has long been an important stop for traders and a focal point of many civilisations. During the Roman Empire, it was the capital of the province of Cilicia. It was the scene of the first meeting between Mark Antony and Cleopatra, and the birthplace of Paul the Apostle.

Tarsus was served by Adana Şakirpaşa Airport, replaced in August 2024 by Çukurova International Airport; and is connected by Turkish State Railways to both Adana and Mersin.

== Etymology ==
The ancient name Tarsos is derived from , the original name given to the city by the Hittites, who were among the earliest settlers of the region. That in turn was possibly derived from the name of the storm god Tarḫunz. During the Hellenistic era Tarsus was known as &quot;Antiochia on the Cydnus&quot; (, ), to distinguish it from Syrian Antioch. The Romans knew it as , while it was in Western Armenian and in Eastern Armenian.

According to the Suda, the city was founded by Perseus after he fought the Isaurians and the Cilicians. An oracle told him to found a city in the place where the flat (ταρσός) of his foot would touch the earth while he was dismounting from his horse after the victory.

==Geography==

Located on the mouth of the Berdan River (Cydnus in antiquity), which empties into the Mediterranean, Tarsus sits at a junction where land and sea routes connecting the Cilician plain (today called Çukurova), central Anatolia and the Mediterranean Sea meet. The climate is typical of the Mediterranean region, with very hot, humid summers and chilly, damp winters.

Tarsus has a long history of commerce, and is still a commercial centre today, trading in the produce of the fertile Çukurova plain. Tarsus is also a thriving industrial centre for refining and processing for export. Industries include agricultural machinery, spare parts, textiles, fruit-processing, brick-making and ceramics.

Agriculture is an important source of income with half the local land area farmland () and most of the remainder forest or orchard. The farmland is mostly well-irrigated, fertilised and managed with up-to-date equipment.

==History==

===Foundation and prehistory===
Archaeological evidence suggests Gözlükule, a mound located in southeastern Tarsus, was the site where humans first settled in the area. Excavations conducted under Princeton University archaeologist Hetty Goldman in the 1930’s and 1940’s at the mound found evidence that the site was occupied from Neolithic to Islamic times. A fortified town existed at the site of Tarsus since at least as early as the 3rd millennium BC.

The settlement stood at the crossing of several important trade routes linking Anatolia to Syria and beyond. Because most of the ruins lie under the modern city, archaeology has barely touched the ancient city. As an important port in a merchant marine trade network spanning the eastern Mediterranean and beyond from before the third millennium, the city was always an important centre for cultural interchange with traces of its influence visible from pre-Homeric Greek evidence onwards. The city may have been of Anatolian or Semitic origin; it is first mentioned as Tarsisi in Neo-Assyrian records of the campaigns of Esarhaddon, as well as several times in the records of Shalmaneser I and Sennacherib, the latter having had the city rebuilt. A Greek legend connects it with the memory of the Assyrian king Sardanapalus (Ashurbanipal), still preserved in the Dunuk-Tach, called &#x27;tomb of Sardanapalus&#x27;, a monument of unknown origin. During the Hellenistic era it was a centre for exchange between Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and Mystery traditions.

Stephanus of Byzantium quotes Athenodorus of Tarsus on another legend:

Much of this legendary account of the foundation of Tarsus, however, appeared in the Roman era, and it is not reliable. The geographer Strabo states that Tarsus was founded by people from Argos who were exploring this coast. Another legend claims that Bellerophon fell off his winged horse Pegasus here, hurting his foot in the process, and that the city was named &quot;tar-sos&quot; (&quot;the sole of the foot&quot;) in memory of his accident. Other candidates for legendary founder of the city include the hero Perseus and Triptolemus, son of the earth-goddess Demeter, doubtless because the countryside around Tarsus is such good farmland. Later the coins of Tarsus bore the image of Hercules due to another tale in which the hero was held prisoner here by the local god Sandon. Tarsus has been suggested as a possible site for the biblical Tarshish, to which the prophet Jonah wanted to flee, but Tartessos in Spain has also been offered as a possible location for this. (See further)

=== Early antiquity ===

In historical times, the city was first ruled by the Hittites, followed by Assyria, and then by the Persian Empire. As the principal town of Cilicia, Tarsus was the seat of a Persian satrapy from 400 BC onward. Indeed, Xenophon records that in 401 BC, when Cyrus the Younger marched against Babylon, the city was governed by King Syennesis in the name of the Persian monarch.

At this period the god of the city was Sandon, of whom a large monument existed at Tarsus at least until the 3rd century AD. Coins showed Sandon standing on a winged and horned lion, and it is now thought likely that the Lion of Saint Mark on the pillar in the Piazza San Marco in Venice was in origin a winged lion-griffin copied from such a monument in Tarsus.

Alexander the Great passed through with his army in 333 BC and nearly met his death here after bathing in the Cydnus. By this time Tarsus was already largely influenced by Greek language and culture, and as part of the Seleucid Empire it became more and more Hellenised. Strabo praised the cultural level of Tarsus in this period with its philosophers, poets and linguists. The schools of Tarsus rivalled those of Athens and Alexandria. A reference in the Bible (2 Maccabees (4:30)) records the city&#x27;s revolt against Antiochus IV Epiphanes in about 171 BC. The king had renamed the town Antiochia on the Cydnus although the name did not stick because too many cities were named Antioch. At this time the library of Tarsus held 200,000 books, including a huge collection of scientific works.

=== Roman period ===


After crushing the feared Cilician pirates, Pompey brought Tarsus under Roman rule In 67 BC, and it became the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia. To flatter Julius Caesar, it was briefly named Juliopolis. Cassius Longinus planned to kill him here as early as 47 BC, and Cleopatra and Mark Antony met and was the scene of the celebrated feasts they gave during the construction of their fleet (41 BC). In William Shakespeare&#x27;s 1606 play &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (Act 5, Scene 2) Cleopatra says she is going to Cydnus to meet Antony after his death, (i.e. she will commit suicide to meet him in the afterlife). &quot;Go fetch / My best attires: I am again for Cydnus, / To meet Mark Antony.&quot;
In the Roman period, the city was an important intellectual centre, boasting its own academy. One of its leading lights, the philosopher Athenodorus Cananites, was the tutor of the first Roman emperor, Augustus, a fact which secured continuous imperial patronage for the city.

When the province of Cilicia was divided, Tarsus remained the civil and religious metropolis of Cilicia Prima, a grand city with palaces, marketplaces, roads and bridges, baths, fountains and waterworks, a gymnasium on the banks of the Cydnus, and a stadium. Tarsus was later eclipsed by nearby Adana but remained important as a port and shipyard. Several Roman emperors were interred here: Marcus Claudius Tacitus, Maximinus II and Julian the Apostate, who planned to move his capital here from Antioch if he returned from his Persian expedition.

===Early Christian and Byzantine eras===
Tarsus was the city where, according to the Acts of the Apostles, Saul of Tarsus was born, although he was brought up in Jerusalem. He was a Roman citizen (Acts 21:39; Acts 22:25–29) &quot;of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city&quot;. Saul, who eventually became Paul the Apostle after his professed encounter with Jesus (), returned here after his conversion (). About eight years later, Barnabas retrieved him from Tarsus to help with the work of preaching and teaching in Syrian Antioch ().

By then, a Christian community probably already existed although the first recorded bishop, Helenus, dates only from the 3rd century. Owing to the importance of Tarsus, many martyrs were put to death there, including Saint Pelagia of Tarsus, Saint Boniface of Tarsus, Saint Marinus of Tarsus, Saint Diomedes, Saint Quiricus and Saint Julitta.

The city remained largely pagan, however, until the time of Julian the Apostate (r. 361–363), who reportedly planned to make it his capital. Following his death during his campaign against Sassanid Persia, he was buried next to the city walls, opposite the earlier tomb of the Tetrarch Maximinus Daza. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) undertook public works in the city, altering the course of the Cydnus river and rebuilding the bridge. Towards the end of his reign, the city suffered from riots stirred up by the Hippodrome Blues faction.

A cave near Tarsus is one of several places said to be the location of the legend of the Seven Sleepers, common to Christianity and Islam.

===Middle Ages===
Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the city came into contact with the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate. It is unclear when the town was first captured by the Arabs, but it is clear that it, and the wider region of Cilicia, remained contested between the Byzantines and the new Caliphate for several decades, up to the early 8th century. According to Muslim sources, as he was retreating the Byzantine emperor Heraclius () deliberately withdrew the population and devastated the region between Antioch and Tarsus, creating a no man&#x27;s land between the two empires.

It was not until the early Abbasid period that Tarsus, by then lying in ruins, was reoccupied and refortified, this time as an advance strongpoint within the fortified zone of the &quot;al-ʿAwāṣim&quot;, stretching from Tarsus northeast to Malatya, and as an assembly point for expeditions against the Byzantine Empire. The first attempt was undertaken by al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba al-Ta&#x27;i in 778/9 but was apparently unsuccessful and the city was not fully restored until 787/8, by Abu Sulaym Faraj on the orders of Caliph Harun al-Rashid (). Three thousand Khurasanis and 2,000 Syrians (a thousand each from Antioch and al-Massisa) were given houses and land in the new fortress city. Tarsus was apparently recovered by the Byzantines soon after, at some point around the turn of the century. The city probably remained in Byzantine hands during the Abbasid civil war of the Fourth Fitna, but returned to Muslim control by 830 when Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun () recommenced offensive campaigns against Byzantium using the city as a base.

Henceforth and until the Byzantine reconquest in the 10th century, Tarsus was one of the main centres for the holy war (&quot;jihād&quot;) against Byzantium, comprising annual raids (&quot;ṣawāʿif&quot;) into Byzantine lands through the Cilician Gates when the mountain snows had melted and passage was possible. These raids were mounted by the local garrisons, maintained by the taxation not only of the frontier zone of the &quot;al-ʿAwāṣim&quot; but also by generous subsidies from the caliphal government, and large numbers of volunteer warriors of the faith (&quot;mujahidun&quot; or &quot;ghazis&quot;). Tarsus remained under direct Abbasid control until 878/9, when it and the wider Cilician border zone were given to the autonomous ruler of Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun. The local governor Yazaman al-Khadim returned the city to the direct allegiance of Baghdad from 882 on, but was forced to recognise the Tulunids again in 890. Tulunid possession of the border zone lasted until the death of Ibn Tulun&#x27;s heir Khumarawayh in 896, after which Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid () re-asserted direct control. The area remained under Abbasid rule for the next four decades. After a brief period when the border zone was under Ikhshidid control, in 946/7, Tarsus recognised the overlordship of the Hamdanid emir Sayf al-Dawla of Aleppo, who had become the new master of northern Syria and the Byzantine borderlands. Facing a resurgent Byzantium, he was able to stem the tide for a while, but in 965,the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas () captured the city, ending Muslim rule there. Throughout this period, the governors of Tarsus also operated an active mint in the city.

The terms of the city&#x27;s surrender allowed any Muslim who wished to leave with as many of his possessions as he could carry. Many of those who left eventually settled, according to al-Muqaddasi, at Baniyas. Most of those who remained behind became Christians and the main mosque was either torn down or turned into a stable. The city remained under Byzantine rule until 1085. It was thereafter disputed between Latin Crusaders, Byzantines (1137–1172), Seljuk Turks and the Armenians of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia (Kingdom of Lesser Armenia). The city was the capital of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia between 1080 and 1198. The Armenians became definitive masters until about 1359 when the city was captured by the Ramadanid Emirate and Mamluk Sultanate. Finally, the area was brought under the control of the Ottoman Empire by Selim I in 1516.

In the Middle Ages, Tarsus was renowned throughout the Middle East; a number of Arab writers praised it as a beautiful and well-defended city, its walls having two layers of fortifications with five gates and earthworks outside, surrounded by rich farmland and watered by the river and the lake.

===Ottoman and modern period===

Under Ottoman rule, Tarsus initially formed part of the Eyalet of Aleppo. After the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571 it became the seat of a &quot;sanjak&quot; (sub-province) within the Cyprus Eyalet, before being transferred in 1608 to the &quot;sanjak&quot; of Adana as a &quot;kaza&quot; (district).

Visiting in 1671 the traveller Evliya Çelebi recorded &quot;a city on the plain, an hour from the sea, surrounded by strong walls two-storeys high, moated on all sides, with three distinct neighbourhoods inside the walls&quot;.

Despite its excellent defences, Tarsus was captured from the Ottomans in 1832 by the Mamluks of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, son of Muhammad Ali, and remained for eight years in Egyptian hands. The Egyptians began growing cotton on the surrounding plain. Following the return of Ottoman rule this cotton drove substantial growth in the local economy, due to increased world demand for the crop during shortages caused by the U.S. Civil War. A new road was built to the port in Mersin and the city of Tarsus grew and thrived. Still today many large houses in the city stand as reminders of the wealth generated during this period. 

However, after 3,000 years as a flourishing port, by the end of the 19th century neglect meant Tarsus lost its access to the sea as the delta became a swamp. At this point it was a typical Ottoman city with communities of Muslim Turks, Christian Greeks and Armenians. With the founding of the Turkish Republic in the 1920s, the swamp was drained and the River Berdan was dammed to build Turkey&#x27;s first hydro-electric power station. Irrigation, roadworks and a railway brought the economy of Tarsus back to life, with new factories particularly producing textiles.

<text>Ann Valerie, Lady Solti (née Pitts; 19 August 1937 – 31 March 2021) was a British television presenter who was one of the BBC&#x27;s original team of presenters during the 1950s. She left the programme in 1960 to marry James Sargent who was stage manager of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company. She also worked at Granada Television. She later married the conductor Sir Georg Solti.

==Life and career==
In 1961 Pitts appeared as a patient in the comedy film Dentist on the Job. She met Georg Solti in September 1964 when she interviewed him, fortuitously, as a last minute alternative to replace a missing news item. Solti pursued her romantically and finally persuaded her to leave her husband. They married on 11 November 1967, and had two daughters, Gabrielle and Claudia. She appeared on children&#x27;s television, as a presenter of &quot;Play School&quot; and then at Granada a series for older children, &quot;ExtraOrdinary&quot;, which covered strange-but-true stories from science and the arts. She gave up her career as a presenter, though she continued to appear occasionally on television (such as on the quiz show, &quot;Face The Music)&quot; and worked with Solti for various charities.

Pitts was the patroness of the World Orchestra for Peace, which her husband founded and whose first concert at the United Nations he conducted. In addition, she has devoted time to other cultural organizations, including the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Trust, the Mariinsky Theatre Trust, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Musica Nel Chiostro, Batignano Italy, the Hungarian Cultural Centre (London), Liszt Academy (Budapest), the Harrogate International Festivals as Vice Patron, and the W11 Opera children&#x27;s opera company in London.

After Sir Georg Solti&#x27;s death on 5 September 1997, Pitts and her two daughters began The Solti Foundation to assist young musicians. In 2002, a website dedicated to Georg Solti was launched, under the instigation of Lady Solti.

Lady Solti died at home in London in March 2021 at the age of 83.

<text>Todd Martin (born July 8, 1970) is an American retired tennis player. He reached the men&#x27;s singles final at the 1994 Australian Open and the 1999 US Open and achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 4.

==Playing career==
Martin was born in Hinsdale, Illinois, and played tennis for two years at Northwestern University before turning professional in 1990. His parents lived in Lansing, Michigan, where Martin went to nearby East Lansing High School. At Northwestern, he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He won his first top-level singles title in 1993 at Coral Springs, Florida. Martin traveled with good friend David Helfer for much of the &#x27;92 season. Helfer went on to play at Kalamazoo College.

Coached by Robert Van&#x27;t Hof, 1994 proved to be a breakout year for Martin. At the year&#x27;s first Grand Slam tournament, he reached the men&#x27;s singles final at the Australian Open, where he lost in straight sets to No. 1 Pete Sampras. At Wimbledon, he made it to the semifinals, before falling to the eventual champion Sampras; the set that Martin took from Sampras in the match was the only set that Sampras lost during the entire tournament. Martin&#x27;s third Grand Slam semifinal of 1994 came at the US Open, where he again fell to the eventual champion, this time Andre Agassi. He also captured singles titles at Queen&#x27;s Club and the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis, the latter of which was the first back-to-back titles.

Martin was a member of the US team Davis Cup for nine consecutive years and part of the championship squad in 1995 (beating Russia 3–2 in the final). He also reached the final of the 1995 Grand Slam Cup, where he lost in straight sets to Goran Ivanišević. He reached the Wimbledon semifinals again in 1996, but eventually lost 10-8 in the fifth set against MaliVai Washington, after holding a 5–1 lead in the final set and serving for the match twice. Martin would later reflect on the outcome and admit that he choked during the crucial moments of the match.[1] He missed most of the 1997 season due to injury, but came back to win two singles titles in Barcelona and Stockholm in 1998.

In 1999, Martin had a solid year, reaching the quarterfinals of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and reached his second Grand Slam final at the US Open. Along the way, Martin had a memorable battle with Greg Rusedski in the fourth round, in which Rusedski held numerous advantages, including a two sets to love lead, serving for the match in the third set, and a 4–1 advantage in the fifth. Yet, Martin was able to prevail in five sets. Martin won 20 of the final 21 points of the match, despite playing with a heavily bandaged leg and dealing with dehydration.[2] In the final, he faced Andre Agassi in a five-set contest, which Agassi eventually won. Martin won another singles title in Sydney that year, and reached his career-high singles ranking of No. 4.

In 2000, Martin again turned in a strong performance at the US Open, reaching the semifinals before falling to the eventual champion, Marat Safin, in straight sets. As with the previous year&#x27;s tournament, Martin made another grueling comeback from a two-set deficit in the fourth round, this time against Carlos Moyà.

Martin was named the ATP&#x27;s Most Improved Player in 1993, and won its Sportsmanship Award in 1993 and 1994. He was president of ATP Players Council for 1995–97 and 1998–99.

From 1994 to 1996, Martin was coached by Robert Van&#x27;t Hof, from 1997 to 2002, he was coached by Dean Goldfine.

In his career, Martin won eight singles and five doubles titles. He retired from the professional tour in 2004. He was the CEO of the International Tennis Hall of Fame until the end of 2022. He is currently the Tournament Director for the Western &amp; Southern Open and is also the Head of Tennis for Beemok Sports and Entertainment.

<doc id="871727" wikidata="Q1244777" url="?curid=871727" title="James L. Buckley">
<text>James Lane Buckley (March 9, 1923 – August 18, 2023) was an American politician and judge who served in the United States Senate as a member of the Conservative Party of New York State in the Republican caucus from 1971 to 1977 and additionally held multiple positions within the Reagan administration. He was also the Republican nominee in the 1980 Connecticut Senate race, but he was defeated by Democrat Chris Dodd.

In 1970, Buckley was elected to the U.S. Senate as the nominee of the Conservative Party of New York; he won the race with 39% of the vote and served from 1971 until 1977. During the first Reagan administration, Buckley served as Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs. He was also President of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty from 1982 to 1985.

Buckley was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on October 16, 1985. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 17, 1985, and he received his commission on December 17, 1985. Buckley assumed senior status on August 31, 1996. He was one of the few people in modern times to have held a constitutional office in all three branches of the American federal government.

==Early life, education, and early career==
James Lane Buckley was born on March 9, 1923, in Manhattan, New York City, to Aloise Steiner and William Frank Buckley Sr., the fourth of ten children to the couple. Because their home language was Spanish, Buckley and siblings learned Spanish before they learned English. He was the older brother of the late conservative writer William F. Buckley Jr. and the uncle of Christopher Taylor Buckley. He was also the uncle of Brent Bozell III and political consultant William F. B. O&#x27;Reilly. His mother, from New Orleans, was of Swiss-German, German, and Irish descent, while his paternal grandparents, from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, were of Irish ancestry.

Buckley attended Millbrook School, and in 1943 earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1942, and during World War II he participated in the battles of Leyte, Lingayen Gulf, and Okinawa. Buckley was discharged with the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade) in 1946. After receiving his Bachelor of Laws from Yale Law School in 1949, he was admitted to the bar of Connecticut in 1950 and practiced law until 1953, when he joined The Catawba Corporation as vice president and director. In 1965, he managed his brother&#x27;s campaign for Mayor of New York. Meanwhile, in May 1953, he married Ann Frances Cooley, with whom he had six children. She died on December 30, 2011.

==Career==
===United States Senate===
====Elections====
=====1968=====
In 1968, Buckley ran for the senatorial nomination of the Conservative Party of New York State, after his brother William F. Buckley Jr. had served as the party&#x27;s mayoral nominee in the 1965 New York City mayoral election. Buckley won the party&#x27;s nomination on April 2, 1968, with the unanimous support of all forty state committeemen. Buckley placed third in the general election behind Republican nominee Jacob Javits and Democratic nominee Paul O&#x27;Dwyer after receiving 1,139,402 votes (17.31%).

===== 1970 =====
On March 16, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy announced that he would seek the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party for the 1968 presidential election. After winning four primaries Kennedy was assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan in Los Angeles, California, on June 6.

Kennedy&#x27;s death left a vacancy in the United States Senate that would be filled through an appointment by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. John W. Gardner, John Lindsay, Burke Marshall, C. Douglas Dillon, Charles Goodell, Ogden Reid, and Whitney Young were all mentioned as possible candidates for the appointment. On August 11, a spokesman for Rockefeller stated that the main choices for the appointment were Gardner, Goodell, and Reid. On September 10, Rockefeller appointed Goodell, a member of the House of Representatives from the 38th congressional district, to fill the vacancy.

On April 6, 1970, Buckley announced that he would seek the Conservative Party&#x27;s senatorial nomination again. The Conservative State Committee convened inside Hotel McAlpin in Manhattan, New York City, on April 7, to select the party&#x27;s nominees in the general election. Kevin P. McGovern attempted to force a primary campaign between himself and Buckley but failed to receive the 25% of delegate votes necessary for a primary. Buckley received nearly ninety percent of the delegate votes and the remainder was split between McGovern and abstaining delegates.

On June 20, F. Clifton White, Buckley&#x27;s campaign manager, announced that Buckley&#x27;s campaign would circulate petitions in an attempt to gain another ballot line named the Independent Alliance Party. Enough valid signatures were collected to gain the additional ballot line, but New York Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo ruled that the Independent Alliance&#x27;s emblem, an outline of New York with Buckley&#x27;s name inside, was illegal as New York&#x27;s election law limited the number of times that a candidate&#x27;s name could appear on a ballot line to one. Lomenzo later allowed the party onto the ballot after the emblem was changed to a shield with the letter &quot;I&quot; inside.

In the general election Buckley defeated Goodell, and Richard Ottinger. Although the Independent Alliance Party received over 100,000 votes in the general election, more than the 50,000 votes required to become an official party and automatic ballot access, it did not become an official party as its only candidate was Buckley, who ran in the Senate election and not in the gubernatorial election where the 50,000 votes were required to come from.

===== 1976 =====
In 1971, Buckley spoke to the Republican National Finance committee about running for reelection in the 1976 elections with the Republican nomination. Peter A. Peyser challenged him in the Republican primary, but Buckley defeated him. Buckley gained Rockefeller&#x27;s support by agreeing to not support Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign against Gerald Ford in the Republican presidential primaries. Buckley lost the general election to Democratic nominee Daniel Patrick Moynihan by a margin of 54% to 45%.

==== Tenure ====
During his tenure in the United States Senate Buckley&#x27;s political affiliation was referred to as Conservative-Republican of New York (C-R-N.Y). The Republican caucus in the Senate voted 36 to 3 in favor of admitting Buckley into their caucus, with Senators Jacob Javits, John Sherman Cooper, and William B. Saxbe all opposing Buckley&#x27;s admittance to the caucus.

In 1971, Buckley was appointed to the air and water pollution, roads, and economic development sub-committees within the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Buckley supported Richard Nixon during the 1972 presidential election and called for the Conservative Party, which had not supported Nixon during the 1968 presidential election, to support Nixon in the current election cycle.

In 1974, Buckley proposed a Human Life Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. If passed, the Amendment would have defined the term &quot;person&quot; in the Fourteenth Amendment to include the embryo. His enacted legislation includes the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) that governs use of student records and the Protection of Pupils&#x27; Rights Act (PPRA) which requires parent notification, right to review, and consent for administration of student surveys to minors if the survey collects information on any of eight specified topics.

In the spring of 1974, with the Watergate scandal continuing to grow in magnitude and seriousness, Buckley surprised and, in some cases, angered some of his allies among Republicans when he called upon the increasingly-embattled Richard M. Nixon to voluntarily resign the presidency. Buckley said that in doing so, he was making no judgment as to Nixon&#x27;s technical legal guilt or innocence of the accusations made against him and in fact denounced those &quot;in and out of the media who have been exploiting the Watergate affair so recklessly&quot; in what he called an effort &quot;to subvert the decisive mandate of the 1972 election.&quot; However, he said that the burgeoning scandal might result in an impeachment process that would tear the country even further apart and so he declared: &quot;There is one way and one way only by which the crisis can be resolved, and the country pulled out of the Watergate swamp. I propose an extraordinary act of statesmanship and courage—an act at once noble and heartbreaking; at once serving the greater interests of the nation, the institution of the Presidency, and the stated goals for which he so successfully campaigned&quot;—Nixon&#x27;s resignation. Buckley was the first major conservative figure to call for resignation. Nixon did not resign at that time but eventually did lose the support of key Republican figures, including Senator Barry Goldwater. Nixon ultimately resigned on August 9, 1974.

Buckley was the lead petitioner in a landmark Supreme Court case, &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; (1976), which &quot;shaped modern campaign-finance law&quot;.

=== 1976 Republican National Convention ===
During the 1976 Republican National Convention, then-Senator Jesse Helms encouraged a &quot;Draft Buckley&quot; movement in an effort to stop the nomination of Ronald Reagan for president. (Reagan had announced that Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker would be his running mate; Helms objected to this decision, believing Schweiker to be too liberal.) The &quot;Draft Buckley&quot; movement was rendered moot when President Gerald Ford narrowly won the party&#x27;s nomination on the first ballot.

== Post-Senate career ==

After his loss in the 1976 election, Buckley worked for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, becoming a member of the executive committee and of its board of directors and eventually advancing to the position of corporate director.

After his 1980 loss in Connecticut, Buckley served in the Reagan administration, first as an undersecretary of State for security assistance, managing military aid to strategically located countries, and then as President of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Munich from 1982 to 1985.

=== Federal judicial service ===
On October 16, 1985, Buckley was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The seat had previously been held by Judge Edward Allen Tamm. Buckley was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 17, 1985, and received his commission on December 17, 1985. He assumed senior status on August 31, 1996.

== Later life and death ==
During the 2016 presidential election Buckley was critical of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump. He stated that his brother William and Reagan would have been shocked by Trump&#x27;s actions. He suggested that he mostly agreed with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson.

Buckley became the oldest living former elected U.S. senator following the death of Fritz Hollings in April 2019 and became the oldest living former U.S. senator following the death of Jocelyn Burdick in December 2019.

Buckley turned 100 on March 9, 2023. He died from injuries suffered in a fall, in Washington, D.C., on August 18, 2023, at age 100.

== Political positions ==
Buckley introduced and led the passage of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, but later in 2010 he publicly supported amendment of the legislation due to college athletic departments using the legislation to hide sexual abuse allegations. He voted against a minimum wage increase in 1974. Buckley was one of eight senators to vote against the Equal Rights Amendment.

<text>USS &quot;Sigourney&quot; (DD–81) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first ship named for James Butler Sigourney.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sigourney&quot; was laid down on 25 August 1917 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts, launched on 16 December 1917, sponsored by Mrs. Granville W. Johnson, and commissioned on 15 May 1918.

==Service history==

===United States Navy===
On 27 May, &quot;Sigourney&quot; sailed from the United States escorting a troopship to France. On arrival at Brest, she was assigned to Commander Naval Forces, France; and, for the remainder of World War I, she escorted convoys through the submarine danger zone extending approximately 500 miles west of Brest. During most of her convoys, &quot;Sigourney&quot; was the flagship of the screen commander but did not herself have any confirmed submarine contacts.

After the Armistice with Germany on 11 November, she performed miscellaneous duties in European waters, including service in early December as flagship of the four-destroyer screen that escorted on the middle part of that transport&#x27;s voyage to carry President Woodrow Wilson from the United States to France for the Versailles Peace Conference. &quot;Sigourney&quot; sailed from Brest for the United States on 26 December 1918 and arrived at Boston on 8 January 1919. After overhaul at Boston and summer training at Newport, &quot;Sigourney&quot; was placed in reserve status at Philadelphia on 1 November 1919, and decommissioned there on 26 June 1922.

===Royal Navy and Royal Norwegian Navy===
&quot;Sigourney&quot; was recommissioned at Philadelphia on 23 August 1940 and sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. There, on 26 November, she was decommissioned and turned over to a Canadian care-and-maintenance party. Commissioned by the British as HMS &quot;Newport&quot; on 5 December, she was transferred as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. &quot;Sigourney&quot; was struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1941.

After engine repairs in England, as HNoMS &quot;Newport&quot;, she operated on convoy duty as a unit of the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy from March 1941 to June 1942. She then reverted to the British, and after repairs, served as an aircraft target ship from June 1943 until placed in reserve in January 1945. &quot;Newport&quot; was scrapped at Granton, Scotland, on 18 February 1947.

<doc id="871739" wikidata="Q1416512" url="?curid=871739" title="Ministry of Economics and Finance (France)">
<text>The Ministry of Economics, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty (, pronounced ), informally referred to as Bercy, is one of the most important ministries in the Government of France. Its minister is one of the most prominent cabinet members after the prime minister. The name of the ministry has changed over time; it has included the terms &quot;economics&quot;, &quot;industry&quot;, &quot;finance&quot; and &quot;employment&quot; throughout its history.

==Responsibilities==
The Minister of Economics and Finance oversees:
* the drafting of laws on taxation by exercising direct authority over the Tax Policy Board (&quot;Direction de la législation fiscale&quot;) of the General Directorate of Public Finances (&quot;Direction générale des Finances publiques&quot;), formerly the Department of Revenue (&quot;Direction générale des impôts&quot;);
* national funds and financial and economic system, especially with the Office of the Treasurer and Receiver General (&quot;Direction générale du Trésor or French Treasury&quot;), not to be confused with the Public Treasury (&quot;Trésor public&quot;), that is the Office of the Comptroller-General (&quot;Direction générale de la comptabilité publique&quot;) under the authority of the Minister of Public Action and Accounts);
* the development, regulation and control of economics including industry, tourism, small business, competition, and consumer security, and other matters excluding energy, industrial security, environmental affairs and transportations which are under the authority of the Ministry of Ecology;
* employment policies and career education.

The officeholder, who has authority on the financial assets of the state, the financial and economic national system and the taxation rules overall, also represents France in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN).

==Location==

The Ministry of the Economy and Finance building is situated in Bercy, in the 12th arrondissement of Paris. The building it shares with the Ministry of Public Action and Accounts extends to the Seine, where there is an embarcadero with fast river boats for faster liaisons to other government agencies. It is also served by Paris Métro lines 6 and 14 at Bercy station.

The 5-hectare complex is made of five buildings: Sully and Turgot buildings (both occupied by the Directorate-General of the Taxes), the Necker building (along the railways), the Vauban building, and the Colbert building (housing the Ministries). The Colbert building contains two 70-meter long arches weighting 8000 tons each (weight of the Eiffel Tower). It is the only administrative building in Paris to have been built at a perpendicular angle against the Seine, and the only one that has part of its foundations in the Seine&#x27;s water.

The saying &quot;the Bercy Fortress&quot; (French: &quot;la forteresse de Bercy&quot;) refers to the ministry as a dark department with obscure civil servants, especially of high rank. This is emphasised by the impressive look of the building.

During the Grands Projets of François Mitterrand, it was decided that the Ministry of Finance would leave the Louvre&#x27;s Richelieu wing where it had been located for 110 years. Forty other offices of the Ministry spread around the capital would be reunited in the new building.

After an architectural contest, Paul Chemetov and Borja Huidobro were selected in December 1982 to design the Colbert, Necker and Vauban buildings. Louis Arretche and Roman Karasinski were selected in July 1983 to design the Tugot and Sully buildings.

Construction started in 1984. In 1989, the Ministry&#x27;s employees left the Louvre to move into the new building. Pierre Bérégovoy was the first finance minister to work in the new building.

==Organisation==
Bruno Le Maire has been Minister of Economics and Finance since 2017. In the government of Prime Minister Jean Castex, he is assisted by three junior ministers: Olivier Dussopt as Minister for Public Accounts, Agnès Pannier-Runacher as Minister for Industry and Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne as Minister for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises.

<doc id="871742" wikidata="Q154899" url="?curid=871742" title="Giovanni de' Bardi">
<text>Giovanni de&#x27; Bardi (5 February 1534 – September 1612), Count of Vernio, was an Italian literary critic, writer, composer and soldier.

== Biography ==
Giovanni de&#x27; Bardi was born in Florence.

While he received a deep classical education, becoming proficient in Latin and Greek as well as learning the craft of music composition, his early years were largely spent as a soldier. Under Grand Duke Cosimo I of Tuscany he fought against Siena, and later he fought at the Siege of Malta (1565) against the Turks. After Malta, and now a captain, he assisted Maximilian II in defeating the Turks in Hungary. But when he was not away on military campaigns, he was busy in Florence and elsewhere as a patron of music and the arts.

Bardi is mainly famous for being host, patron, and inspiration to the group of composers, music theorists and scholars who made up the Florentine Camerata, the group which attempted to restore the aesthetic effect of ancient Greek music to contemporary practice. The group included Vincenzo Galilei (father of the astronomer Galileo), Giulio Caccini, and Pietro Strozzi (composer), and derived its inspiration from a correspondence with Girolamo Mei, the foremost scholar of ancient Greek drama and music at the time. The result of the association was the invention of monody, and shortly thereafter, opera; in addition, the innovations brought to music by the Camerata under the guidance of Bardi were one of the defining characteristics of what we now know as Baroque music.

Although he was also a composer, relatively few of his works survive: only a handful of madrigals. Curiously, he seems not to have tried his hand at the new monody himself. He also either organized or wrote parts for various &quot;intermedi&quot; in Florence, the popular court entertainments which took place between the acts of spoken dramas (and which included acting, singing, dancing, and mime — thus being another important precursor to opera). He also wrote plays, including some of the plays for which he also provided the &quot;intermedi&quot;.

Vincenzo Galilei thought highly of Bardi, and dedicated his famous &quot;Dialogo della musica antica et della moderna&quot; to him. In the &quot;Dialogo&quot;, Galilei condemns polyphony, praises monody, and expresses the wish that the musical practice of the ancient Greeks would be restored; corrupt and incomprehensible contemporary music would be replaced with an idealized version of the supposed music of the ancient time. The Counter-Reformation Council of Trent had just finished condemning polyphonic practice, for the same supposed fault (it was too hard to understand the sung text), but for spiritual rather than secular reasons.

<doc id="871745" wikidata="Q3243689" url="?curid=871745" title="List of female United States Cabinet members">
<text>The Cabinet of the United States, which is the principal advisory body to the President of the United States, has had 68 female members altogether, with seven of them serving in multiple positions for a total of 75 cabinet appointments. Of that number, 40 different women held a total of 43 permanent cabinet posts, having served as the Vice President or heads of the federal executive departments; 32 more women held cabinet-level positions, which can differ under each president; and four officeholders served in both cabinet and cabinet-rank roles. No woman held a presidential cabinet position before the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which prohibits the federal government or any state from denying citizens the right to vote on the basis of sex.

Frances Perkins became the first woman to serve in a president&#x27;s cabinet when she was appointed Secretary of Labor by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. Patricia Roberts Harris was the first African-American woman and the first woman of color to serve in a presidential cabinet when she was named Secretary of Housing and Urban Development by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Two years later, Carter tapped her for Secretary of Health and Human Services, therefore making her the first woman to hold two different cabinet positions. Madeleine Albright, who was born in Czechoslovakia, became the first foreign-born woman to serve in a president&#x27;s cabinet when she was picked by President Bill Clinton for United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a cabinet-rank position, in 1993. She was elevated to Secretary of State four years later, during Clinton&#x27;s second term, thus making her, at the time, the highest-ranking woman in the history of the federal government.

On January 26, 2005, Condoleezza Rice assumed the post of Secretary of State under President George W. Bush, which made her the highest-ranked woman among cabinet secretaries to enter the presidential line of succession, standing fourth. Nancy Pelosi surpassed Rice on January 4, 2007, when her election as the first female Speaker of the House put her second in line to the presidency. Kamala Harris replaced Pelosi to become the highest-ranking woman ever to be in the line of succession upon being inaugurated as the first female Vice President on January 20, 2021, alongside President Joe Biden.

President Joe Biden named the most women as secretaries to his first-term Cabinet, with five: former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen as Secretary of the Treasury; U.S. representative Deb Haaland (D-NM) as Secretary of the Interior; Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo as Secretary of Commerce; U.S. representative Marcia Fudge (D-OH) as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm as Secretary of Energy, exceeding by one the record set by President Barack Obama. However, including cabinet reshuffles during his second term in office, Obama still holds the record for most women appointed to permanent cabinet positions with eight, the most of any presidency, therefore surpassing George W. Bush&#x27;s previous record of six appointees. If all his nominees are confirmed, Donald Trump will match Obama&#x27;s record in his second administration.

The Department of Labor has had the most female secretaries, with seven. The Department of Health and Human Services has had five; the 
Department of Commerce has had four; the Departments of Education, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, and Transportation have had three; the Department of Energy have had two; and the Departments of Agriculture and Treasury have had one. The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are the only existing executive departments that do not have female secretaries yet.

The totals for this list include only women presidential appointees confirmed (if necessary) by the U.S. Senate to cabinet or cabinet-level positions and taking their oath of office; they do not include acting officials or nominees awaiting confirmation.

==Permanent cabinet members==
The following list includes women who have held permanent cabinet positions, all of whom are in the line of succession to the presidency. The table below is organized based on the beginning of their terms in office. Officeholders whose terms begin the same day are listed according to the presidential order of succession.

:&quot; denotes the first female holder of that particular office&quot;

===Former permanent cabinet members===
*The Secretary of War became defunct when the Department of War was split between the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947, and both were absorbed into the Department of Defense in 1949. No woman had ever served while it was a cabinet post.
*The Postmaster General ceased to be a member of the cabinet when the Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service (USPS) by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. No woman had ever served while it was a cabinet post. Megan Brennan became the first woman to serve as Postmaster General in 2015. She was appointed after the USPS became an independent agency of the executive branch.
*The Secretary of Commerce and Labor became renamed when the Department of Commerce and Labor was split between the Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor. The Department of Commerce is considered a continuation of the Department of Commerce and Labor under a new name. No woman had ever served under the original title of the position.
*The Secretary of the Army ceased to be a member of the cabinet when the Department of the Army became a component of the Department of Defense in 1949. No woman had ever served while it was a cabinet post. Christine Wormuth became the first woman to serve as Secretary of the Army in 2021. She was appointed after it became a position beneath the Secretary of Defense.
*The Secretary of the Navy ceased to be a member of the cabinet when the Department of the Navy became a component of the Department of Defense in 1949. No woman had ever served while it was a cabinet post. Susan Livingstone became the first woman to serve as acting Secretary of the Navy in 2003. She was appointed after it became a position beneath the Secretary of Defense.
*The Secretary of the Air Force ceased to be a member of the cabinet when the Department of the Air Force became a component of the Department of Defense in 1949. No woman had ever served while it was a cabinet post. Sheila Widnall became the first woman to serve as Secretary of the Air Force in 1993. She was appointed after it became a position beneath the Secretary of Defense.

==Cabinet-level positions==
The president may designate or remove additional officials as members of the cabinet. These positions have not always been in the cabinet, so some female officeholders may not be listed.

The following list includes women who have held cabinet-level positions, which can vary under each president. They are not in the line of succession and are not necessarily officers of the United States. The table below is organized based on the beginning of their terms in office while it was raised to cabinet-level status. Officeholders whose terms begin the same day are listed alphabetically by last name.

<doc id="871746" wikidata="Q302217" url="?curid=871746" title="Aaron Krickstein">
<text>Aaron Krickstein (born August 2, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, is an American former professional tennis player who competed on the ATP Tour from 1983 to 1996. He currently competes on the Outback Champions Series Over-30 tour.

Krickstein reached his career high ATP ranking of World No. 6 on February 26, 1990. He achieved this ranking on the back of wins in Sydney and Los Angeles, as well as his best ever results at Wimbledon and the US Open. He is perhaps best known for his five-set, marathon loss to Jimmy Connors at the 1991 US Open, which ESPN called &quot;an instant classic&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Krickstein was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the son of Evelyn, a housewife, and Herb Krickstein, a pathologist.
His sister, Kathy, won the Big Ten tennis championship in 1978. He is the uncle of LPGA golfer Morgan Pressel, Kathy&#x27;s daughter.

Krickstein is Jewish and in the early 1990s was one of three highly ranked Jewish-American tennis players, along with Jay Berger and Brad Gilbert.

Krickstein has been the director of tennis at St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton, Florida, since 2002.

== Career ==

=== Junior ===
Krickstein started playing tennis when he was six. He became an active competitor on the high school tennis scene during his teens, and still holds the Michigan record for most consecutive match wins at this level (56). He played for University Liggett School.

Krickstein won the American National Under 16 championship in 1982. While still only 16, he was the US National Junior Tennis Association Champion, Clay Champion, and USTA National Champion in the 18s in 1983. He won five consecutive junior championships.

=== Professional ===
Krickstein set an ATP record for being the youngest player to win a singles title on the ATP Tour (at age 16, 2 months after his 16th birthday), in Tel Aviv. Krickstein set a record for being the youngest player to ever break the top 10 (at age 17). As of 2025, both records still stand.

In 1984, he won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championship, becoming its youngest winner, and a clay court tournament in Boston. In 1989 he won the Tokyo Indoor Tennis Tournament and a hard court tournament in Sydney, Australia. In 1991, 1992, and 1993 he won the South African Open.

Krickstein had an injury-plagued career, which included stress fractures in his feet, problems with his knees and wrists in 1985 and 1986, and injuries suffered when he was hurt in a car accident in 1987.

His best finishes in a Grand Slam event were at the 1989 US Open, and at the 1995 Australian Open, where he reached the semi-finals.

Krickstein is perhaps best remembered for his famous five-set match against Jimmy Connors on Labor Day at the 1991 US Open. Krickstein had led the match 2–1 in sets and was ahead 5–2 in the fifth set, before losing the match in a tiebreaker. The match lasted four hours and 41 minutes. According to ESPN, &quot;The match was an instant classic.&quot; Before retractable roofs were constructed for use at the US Open, this match was the default television filler during tournament rain delays; because of this, it is probably the most viewed tennis match of all time. For about 24 years after the match, Krickstein and Connors only spoke a few words to each other. But in 2014, Krickstein called Connors to invite him to play a &quot;reunion match&quot; for members at the Florida country club where Krickstein was (and still is) the tennis director. They played in February 2015 and Krickstein won a pro set 8–5.

He had a record of 10 career wins from 0–2 set deficits. His nickname &quot;Marathon Man&quot; was a reference to his ability to make a comeback when behind in a match. Krickstein won 28 of his 37 career matches that went into a fifth set.

Krickstein defeated a number of top players, including Ivan Lendl (world #1) in 1990, Michael Stich (world #2 and #4) in 1994 and 1991, Stefan Edberg (world #3) in 1988 at the US Open, Boris Becker (world #3) in 1992, Mats Wilander (world #4) in 1984, Jimmy Arias (world #5) in 1984, and Sergi Bruguera (world #5) in 1994. He won against Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.

=== Davis Cup ===
Krickstein was a member of the United States Davis Cup team from 1985 to 1987, and also was a member of the 1990 squad. He compiled a 6–4 record in singles play during Davis Cup ties. The highlight of Krickstein&#x27;s Davis Cup career came in 1990 when he scored two, hard-fought victories in a World Group Quarterfinal tie against Czechoslovakia, leading his team to a 4–1 win.

<doc id="871748" wikidata="Q655118" url="?curid=871748" title="2005 Tour de France">
<text>The 2005 Tour de France was the 92nd edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours. It took place between 2–24 July, with 21 stages covering a distance . It has no overall winner—although American cyclist Lance Armstrong originally won the event, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced on 24 August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1 August 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005. The verdict was subsequently confirmed by the UCI.

The first stages were held in the département of the Vendée, for the third time in 12 years. The 2005 Tour was announced on 28 October 2004. It was a clockwise route, visiting the Alps before the Pyrenees. Armstrong took the top step on the podium, for what was then the seventh consecutive time. He was accompanied on the podium by Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich, but in 2012 Ullrich&#x27;s results were annulled. The points classification was won by Thor Hushovd, and the mountains classification by Michael Rasmussen.

The race was seen by 15 million spectators along the road, and by 2 billion viewers on TV.

==Teams==

In 2005, the UCI had started the ProTour: 20 teams were given a ProTour licence, and were required to start in all ProTour races, which included the Tour de France. The Tour de France organisation was not happy with this rule, as they wanted to be able to decide which teams would join their race. While negotiations were still ongoing, it was decided to use the UCI rule for the 2005 Tour, so all 20 ProTour teams were automatically invited. The Tour organisation could invite one extra team with a wildcard, and used this to invite . All teams were composed of nine cyclists, so 189 riders in 21 teams commenced the 2005 Tour de France. Of them, 155 riders finished.

The teams entering the race were:

==Pre-race favourites==
The main favourite was (then) six-time winner Armstrong (now stripped of all his victories). Armstrong had had doubts if he should start the 2005 Tour, but decided in February 2005 that he would race. His main rival Ullrich was happy with this decision, as he thought it would be a better race with Armstrong present.

In previous years, Ullrich never had the full support of his team to win the general classification, as his team was also aiming for stage victories. In 2005, Erik Zabel, who had won the points classification six times, was left out of the team, and Ullrich was supported by Klöden and Vinokourov, who both had already reached the podium on the Tour.

On the day before the Tour started, Ullrich crashed into his team director&#x27;s car, but was not seriously injured.

==Route and stages==

The Tour commemorated the death of Fabio Casartelli. During the 15th stage the riders passed the Col de Portet d&#x27;Aspet, where Casartelli died exactly 10 years earlier, in the 1995 Tour de France. The Tour also commemorated the first time there was an official mountain climb in the Tour, the Ballon d&#x27;Alsace. During the 9th stage this mountain was passed again, exactly 100 years after the first ascent in the Tour.

The 2005 Tour de France was divided into 21 stages. These stages belong to different categories: 8 were flat stages, 5 were medium mountain stages, 5 were high mountain stages, 2 were individual time trials and 1 was a team time trial. The distinction between flat stage, medium mountain stage and high mountain stage is important for the points classification. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 11. There were two rest days, in Grenoble and in Pau.

The traditional prologue on the first day was replaced by an individual time trial of more than twice the length of a standard prologue. This stage crossed from the mainland of France to the Île de Noirmoutier. The most famous route to this island is the Passage du Gois, a road that is under water at high tide. This road was included in the 1999 Tour. Several of the favourites crashed there that year, and ended that stage 7 minutes behind the peloton. This year they took the bridge to the island. Later in the race, there was one more time trial, on the penultimate day. Also, there were just three uphill finishes (Courchevel, Ax-3 Domaines and Pla d&#x27;Adet), a lower number than in previous years. The finish line of the last stage was, as has been since 1975, on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.

In the stages that were not time trials, there were intermediate sprints. Cyclist who crossed the intermediate sprints first received points for the points classification, and bonification seconds for the general classification. Until stage 8, there were three intermediate sprints, and from stage 9 on there were two.

==Race overview==

In Stage 1, David Zabriskie, a former teammate of Lance Armstrong, beat Armstrong by two seconds. In the team time trial of stage 4, Zabriskie fell in the last kilometres, and Armstrong took over the lead.

Armstrong initially refused to wear the yellow jersey in the fifth stage but was forced by the Tour organisation, who threatened to remove him from the race.

In the tenth stage, the start was moved from Grenoble to Froges.

Before the 20th stage, an individual time trial, Michael Rasmussen occupied the third place in the general classification. During that stage, Rasmussen fell multiple times and changed bicycles multiple times, and lost so much time that he ended up at the seventh place in the general classification. All total throughout the stage he changed bikes twice, changed wheels twice, began to hesitate going through corners and went off the road. His final time during this ITT was still better than half the field.

The race jury invoked the &#x27;rain rule&#x27; for the Champs-Élysées, meaning that Lance Armstrong became the winner of the General classification the first time the race passed the finish line, rather than the eighth time as normal. The time bonification for the winner of the stage was still given, and Alexander Vinokourov profited from this as he won the stage after an escape in the last kilometre (the first time since 1994 that the final stage did not end in a sprint), and passed Levi Leipheimer in the general classification to end fifth.

During the final ceremonies in Paris, Armstrong was allowed to talk to the crowds, the first time in the Tour&#x27;s history that a winner was given this chance. It has since become a regular occurrence.

===Doping===

During the race, 143 urine tests and 21 blood tests were conducted. None of them returned positive. Still, there were fears that banned substances were being used; the boss of the team (not racing in the 2005 Tour) questioned the increase in velocities.

In 2010, Hans Michael Holczer, the team boss of Gerolsteiner in 2005, said that the UCI had informed him that Leipheimer had shown blood values just under the doping limit, and that Holczer suspected that Leipheimer was doping. The UCI advised Gerolsteiner to find a reason to remove Leipheimer from the race, but Holczer refused, because his team was still facing bad publicity from a previous doping case.

The top five of the general classification of 2005 would not compete the 2006 edition. Armstrong had retired after the 2005 Tour, and a few days before the 2006 edition, after it became public that (among others) Basso, Ullrich and Mancebo were under investigation in the Operacion Puerto doping case, the Tour organisation and team leaders decided to exclude all cyclists under investigation from joining the Tour. Vinokourov, fifth-placed in 2005, was not under investigation, but his team was reduced to five cyclists, below the minimal required amount of six, so he could also not compete.

In February 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport found Ullrich guilty of being engaged in Fuentes&#x27; doping program, and decided that Ullrich&#x27;s results since May 2005, including his results from the 2005 Tour de France, would be disqualified.

Subsequent to Armstrong&#x27;s statement to withdraw his fight against United States Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s (USADA) charges, on 24 August 2012, the USADA said it would ban Armstrong for life and stripped him of his record seven Tour de France titles. Later that day it was confirmed in a USADA statement that Armstrong was banned for life and would be disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 1 August 1998, including forfeiture of any medals, titles, winnings, finishes, points and prizes. On 22 October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale endorsed the USADA sanctions, and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events.

Michael Rasmussen, winner of the mountains classification, revealed in 2013 that in a doping test his value of immature red blood cells was below the minimum threshold, but that the UCI allowed him to continue in the race because they did not want an incident.

==Classification leadership and minor prizes==

There were four main individual classifications contested in the 2005 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider&#x27;s finishing times on each stage, with time bonuses given at the end of each mass start stage. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.

The second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage&#x27;s type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.

The third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category, or &quot;hors catégorie&quot; for the most difficult climbs. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.

The final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1980. The leader wore a white jersey.

The final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.

In addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have &quot;made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship&quot;. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Óscar Pereiro () was given the overall super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 11. This prize was won by Alexander Vinokourov.

*In stage 1, Lance Armstrong wore the green jersey.

<text>OpenVG is an API designed for hardware-accelerated 2D vector graphics. Its primary platforms are mobile phones, gaming &amp; media consoles and consumer electronic devices. It was designed to help manufacturers create more attractive user interfaces by offloading computationally intensive graphics processing from the CPU onto a GPU to save energy. The OpenGL ES library provides similar functionality for 3D graphics. OpenVG is managed by the non-profit technology consortium Khronos Group.

== History ==
The OpenVG group was formed on July 6, 2004 by a selection of major firms including 3Dlabs, Bitboys, Ericsson, Hybrid Graphics, Imagination Technologies, Motorola, Nokia, PalmSource, Symbian, and Sun Microsystems. Other firms including chip manufacturers ATI, LG Electronics, Mitsubishi Electric, NVIDIA, and Texas Instruments and software- and/or IP vendors DMP, Esmertec, ETRI, Falanx Microsystems, Futuremark, HI Corporation, Ikivo, HUONE (formerly MTIS), Superscape, and Wow4M have also participated in the working group. The first draft specification from the group was made available at the end of 2004, and the 1.0 version of the specification was released on August 1, 2005.

On January 16, 2007, Zack Rusin from Tungsten Graphics announced the start of an independent open-source implementation of OpenVG built on top of QtOpenGL.

Shortly after, Ivan Leben started another open-source project to implement an ANSI C implementation of the specification on top of OpenGL.

Since February 27, 2007 the OpenVG Sample Reference Implementation is available from the Khronos Website under MIT open source license.

On December 9, 2008, the Khronos Group publicly released the OpenVG 1.1 Specification. This latest revision includes glyph rendering for accelerated text, improved anti-aliasing, and Flash support. An updated reference implementation is also provided, as well as a conformance test suite.

On May 1, 2009 Rusin added OpenVG state tracker to Mesa, which enables SVG vector graphics to be hardware accelerated by any Gallium3D-based driver. It was removed again in Mesa 10.6 on June 15, 2015.

In September 2011 OpenVG working group decided not to make any regular meeting for further standardization. However, working group decided to continue maintenance and promotion of OpenVG 1.1 specification.

<text>The Minister of the Armed Forces (, ) is the leader and most senior official of the French Ministry of the Armed Forces, tasked with running the French Armed Forces. The minister is the third-highest civilian having authority over France&#x27;s military, behind the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister. Based on the governments, they may be assisted by a minister or state secretary for veterans&#x27; affairs.

The office is considered to be one of the core positions of the Government of France. Since 20 May 2022, the Minister of the Armed Forces has been Sébastien Lecornu, the 45th person to hold the office.

== History ==
The minister in charge of the Armed Forces has evolved within the epoque and regimes. The Secretary of State of War was one of the four specialised secretaries of state established in France in 1589. This State Secretary was responsible for the French Army (similarly, the Naval Ministers of France and the Colonies was created in 1669). In 1791, the Secretary of State of War became Minister of War, with this ministerial function being abolished in 1794 and re-established in 1795. Since 1930, the position was often referred to as Minister of War and National Defence. In 1947, two years after World War II, the ministry merged with the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Air (created in 1930), while being headed by a Minister of National Defence responsible for the French Armed Forces, often referred to as Minister of the Armies and since 1947 until 2017, designated as Minister of Defence.

== Powers and functions ==
As the head of the military, the minister is part of the Council of Defence. In addition to their authority over the armed forces, the minister also heads the external and military intelligence community. In this capacity, they are also a member of the National Council of Intelligence.

Although the Minister of the Armed Forces is the official responsible for veterans affairs, they usually delegate their powers to a dedicated subordinate minister or state secretary.

The direct military subordinates of the minister are the:
* Chief of the Defence Staff
* Delegate General for the Armament
* Secretary General for the Administration

== Officeholders ==
=== Provisional Government ===
=== Fourth Republic ===
=== Fifth Republic ===

<doc id="871780" wikidata="Q196731" url="?curid=871780" title="Destroyers-for-bases deal">
<text>The destroyers-for-bases deal was an agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom on 2 September 1940, according to which 50 , , and -class US Navy destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy from the US Navy in exchange for land rights on British possessions. At the time, the United States was neutral in World War II.

Generally referred to as the &quot;twelve hundred-ton type&quot; (also known as &quot;flush-deck&quot;, or &quot;four-pipers&quot; after their four funnels), the destroyers became the British and were named after towns common to both countries. US President Franklin Roosevelt used an executive agreement, which does not require congressional approval. He was sharply criticised from antiwar Americans, who pointed out that the agreement violated the Neutrality Acts.

The agreement provided little military benefit to the United Kingdom. It was valued chiefly for its diplomatic and propaganda value in demonstrating American support in a period in which the British government was seeking to secure American participation in the war.

== Background ==
By late June 1940, France had surrendered to Germany and Italy. The British Empire and the Commonwealth stood alone in warfare against Hitler and Mussolini. The British Chiefs of Staff Committee concluded in May that if France collapsed, &quot;we do not think we could continue the war with any chance of success&quot; without &quot;full economic and financial support&quot; from the United States. The US government was sympathetic to Britain&#x27;s plight, but US public opinion overwhelmingly supported isolationism to avoid involvement in &quot;another European war&quot;. Reflecting that sentiment, the US Congress had passed the Neutrality Acts three years earlier, which banned the shipment or sale of arms from the US to any combatant nation. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt was further constrained because 1940 Presidential election was due, as his critics sought to portray him as being pro-war. Legal advice from the US Justice Department stated that the transaction was legal.

By late May, the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk, France, in Operation Dynamo caused the Royal Navy to need ships immediately, especially as it was fighting the Battle of the Atlantic in which German U-boats threatened the British supplies of food and of other resources essential to the war effort. With German troops advancing rapidly into France and many in the US government convinced that the defeat of France and Britain was imminent, the US sent a proposal to London through the British ambassador, the Marquess of Lothian, for an American lease of airfields on Trinidad, Bermuda and Newfoundland.

The Prime Minister Winston Churchill initially rejected the offer on 27 May unless Britain received something immediate in return. On 1 June, as the defeat of France loomed, Roosevelt bypassed the Neutrality Act by declaring as &quot;surplus&quot; many millions of rounds of US ammunition and obsolescent small arms and authorising their shipment to Britain. Roosevelt rejected Churchill&#x27;s pleas for destroyers for the Royal Navy. By August, while Britain was reaching a low point, US Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy reported from London that a British surrender was &quot;inevitable&quot;. Seeking to persuade Roosevelt to send the destroyers, Churchill warned Roosevelt that if Britain were vanquished, its colonial islands close to American shores could become a direct threat to the US if they fell into German hands.

== Deal ==
Roosevelt approved the deal on the evening of 30 August 1940. On 2 September 1940, as the Battle of Britain intensified, Secretary of State Cordell Hull signaled agreement to the transfer of the warships to the Royal Navy. On 3 September 1940, Admiral Harold Stark certified that the destroyers were not vital to US security. In exchange, the US was granted land in various British possessions for the establishment of naval or air bases with rent-free 99-year leases, on:
* Newfoundland
* Eastern side of the Bahamas
* Southern coast of Jamaica
* Western coast of Saint Lucia
* West coast of Trinidad (Gulf of Paria)
* Antigua
* British Guiana (now Guyana) within fifty miles of Georgetown

The agreement also granted the US air and naval base rights in:
* The Great Sound and Castle Harbour, Bermuda
* South and eastern coasts of Newfoundland

No destroyers were received in exchange for the bases in Bermuda and Newfoundland. Both territories were vital to trans-Atlantic shipping, aviation, and the Battle of the Atlantic. Although an attack on either territory was unlikely, it could not be discounted and Britain had been forced wastefully to maintain defensive forces, including the Bermuda Garrison. The deal allowed Britain to hand much of the defence of Bermuda to the neutral US, which freed British forces for redeployment to more active theatres and enabled the development of strategic facilities at US expense, which British forces would also use.
The Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) maintained air stations in Bermuda at the start of the war, but they served only flying boats. The RAF station on Darrell&#x27;s Island served as a staging point for trans-Atlantic flights by RAF Transport Command and RAF Ferry Command, BOAC, and Pan-Am and hosted the Bermuda Flying School, but it did not operate maritime patrols. The FAA station on Boaz Island serviced aircraft based on vessels operating from or through the Royal Naval Dockyard, but it attempted to maintain maritime patrols by using pilots from naval ships, RAF Darrell&#x27;s Island and the Bermuda Flying School.

The agreement for bases in Bermuda stipulated that the US would, at its own expense, build an airfield capable of handling large landplanes that would be operated jointly by the US Army Air Force and the Royal Air Force. The airfield was named Kindley Field after Field Kindley, an American aviator who fought for Britain during World War I. RAF Transport Command relocated its operations to the airfield when it was completed in 1943, but RAF Ferry Command remained at Darrell&#x27;s Island. The US Navy had established the Naval Operating Base at Bermuda&#x27;s West End, a flying boat station from which maritime patrols were operated for the remainder of the war (the US Navy had actually begun operating such patrols from RAF Darrell&#x27;s Island by using floatplanes and was waiting for their own base to become operational). The RAF and FAA facilities were closed after the war, which left only the US air bases in Bermuda. The Naval Operating Base ceased to be an air station in 1965, when its flying boats were replaced by Lockheed P-2 Neptunes operating from the Kindley Air Force Base (as the former US Army airfield had become). Those US air bases were in fact only two of several US military facilities that operated in Bermuda during the 20th century. In spite of the 99-year lease, the US abandoned many of the bases in 1949, and the remaining few were closed by 1995.

The US accepted the &quot;generous action... to enhance the national security of the United States&quot; and immediately transferred in return 50 &quot;Caldwell&quot;, &quot;Wickes&quot;, and &quot;Clemson&quot;-class U.S. Navy destroyers, &quot;generally referred to as the twelve hundred-ton type&quot; (also known as &quot;flush-deckers&quot;, or &quot;four-pipers&quot; after their four funnels). Forty-three ships initially went to the Royal Navy and seven to the Royal Canadian Navy. In the Commonwealth navies, the ships were renamed after towns and so were known as the &quot;Town&quot; class, but they had originally belonged to three classes (&quot;Caldwell&quot;, &quot;Wickes&quot;, and &quot;Clemson&quot;). Before the end of the war, nine others had also served with the Royal Canadian Navy. Five Towns were manned by Royal Norwegian Navy crews, with the survivors later returned to the Royal Navy. was manned by Royal Netherlands Navy sailors before her assignment to the St. Nazaire Raid. Nine other destroyers were eventually transferred to the Soviet Navy. Six of the 50 destroyers were lost to U-boats, and three others, including &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, were destroyed in other circumstances.

Britain had no choice but to accept the deal, but it was so much more advantageous to the United States than Britain that Churchill&#x27;s aide John Colville compared it to the USSR&#x27;s relationship with Finland. The destroyers were in reserve from the massive US shipbuilding program during World War I, and many of the vessels required extensive overhaul because they had not been preserved properly while inactivated. One British admiral called them the &quot;worst destroyers I had ever seen&quot;, and only 30 were in service by May 1941. Churchill also disliked the deal, but his advisers persuaded him merely to tell Roosevelt, 

Roosevelt responded by transferring ten Lake-class Coast Guard cutters to the Royal Navy in 1941. The United States Coast Guard vessels were ten years younger than the destroyers and had greater range, which made them more useful as anti-submarine convoy escorts.

The agreement was much more important for being the start of the Atlantic Charter the wartime Anglo-American partnership. Churchill said in the British Parliament that &quot;these two great organisations of the English-speaking democracies, the British Empire and the United States, will have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage&quot;.

The current minister of justice has been Gérald Darmanin since 2024. The ministry is headquartered on Place Vendôme in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.

==Function==
The roles of the minister are to:
* oversee the building, maintenance and administration of courts;
* sit as vice president of the Judicial Council (which oversees the judicial performance and advises on prosecutiorial performance);
* supervise public prosecutions;
* direct corrections and the prison system
* propose legislation affecting civil or criminal law or procedure.

The Minister of Justice also holds the ceremonial office of Keeper of the Seals of France and is custodian of the Great Seal of France. This symbolic role is still shown in the order of words of the minister&#x27;s official designation, Minister of Justice, Keeper of the Seals (&quot;Ministre de la Justice, garde des Sceaux&quot;).

France&#x27;s Ministry of Justice might oversee the administration of justice in French Guiana, French Polynesia, Guadeloupe, Jersey, Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Réunion, Saint Barthélemy, Saint-Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon and Wallis and Futuna.

<doc id="871782" wikidata="Q27993" url="?curid=871782" title="Central Siberian Yupik language">
<text>Central Siberian Yupik&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-3/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as Siberian Yupik, Bering Strait Yupik, Yuit, Yoit, &quot;St. Lawrence Island Yupik&quot;, and in Russia &quot;Chaplinski Yupik&quot; or Yuk) is an endangered Yupik language spoken by the Indigenous Siberian Yupik people along the coast of Chukotka in the Russian Far East and in the villages of Savoonga and Gambell on St. Lawrence Island. The language is part of the Eskimo-Aleut language family.

In the United States, the Alaska Native Language Center identified about 400-750 Yupigestun speakers, considering “dormant speakers” who understand but cannot converse. In Russia in 2021, 172 people indicated that they speak the language, while only 92 of them use it in everyday life. Thus, the total number of speakers is no more than 550-900 people.

== Dialects and subgroups ==
Siberian Yupik has two dialects: Chaplino (Chaplinski) Yupik (Uŋazigmit) is spoken on the shores of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Russian Far North, and St. Lawrence Island Yupik (Sivuqaghmiistun) is spoken on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska.

Chaplino, or &quot;Uŋazigmit&quot;, is the largest Yupik language of Siberia (the second one is Naukan Yupik), and is named after the settlement of &quot;Уӈазиӄ&quot; (Ungaziq; or &quot;Old Chaplino&quot; in Russian). The word &quot;Ungazighmii&quot; / Уңазиӷмӣ (plural &quot;Ungazighmiit&quot; / Уңазиӷмӣт ) means &quot;Ungaziq inhabitant(s)&quot;. People speaking this language live in several settlements in the southeastern Chukchi Peninsula (including Novoye Chaplino, Provideniya, and Sireniki), Uelkal, Wrangel Island, and Anadyr. The majority of Chaplino Yupik speakers live in the villages of Novoye Chaplino and Sireniki. In another terminology, these people speak Chaplino, and Ungazighmiit people speak one of its dialects, along with other dialects spoken by Avatmit, Imtugmit, Kigwagmit, which can be divided further into even smaller dialects.

The second dialect, St. Lawrence Island Yupik, is believed to be an offspring of Chaplino with only minor phonetic, phonological, morphological, syntactical and lexical differences, and the two dialects are virtually identical.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Unlike the Central Alaskan Yupik languages, Siberian Yupik has a series of retroflex fricatives, more similar to the Alaskan Inuit dialects.
=== Vowels ===
== Morphosyntax ==
Morphosyntax is the study of grammatical categories or linguistic units that have both morphological and syntactic properties. Central Siberian Yupik’s structure most resembles this category. In addition, CSY can be described as using both internal and external syntax. Internal syntax is used here to describe the way that postbases are added to a base or added to one another, contrasted with external syntax, which refers to the order of independent words.

Central Siberian Yupik is a polysynthetic language, meaning it is made up of long, structured words containing many separate meaningful parts (morphemes). In fact, a single word can be an entire sentence. CSY is also an ergative-absolutive language, in contrast to the nominative-accusative structure of English and many Indo-European languages.

Most Siberian Yupik words consist of a &quot;base&quot; or &quot;stem&quot;, followed by zero or more &quot;postbases&quot;, followed by one &quot;ending&quot;, followed by zero or more &quot;enclitics&quot;:

Generally, the “base” or “stem” contains the root meaning of the word , while the “postbases,” which are suffixing morphemes, provide additional components of the sentence (see example above). As shown, postbases include items with adjectival and verbal qualities, among other elements. The “ending” (Woodbury’s term) is an inflectional suffix to the right of the postbase that contains grammatical information such as number, person, case, or mood. Enclitics are bound suffixes that follow the inflectional ending of a word. An attached enclitic affects the meaning of the entire sentence, not just the element to which it is attached. The exception is the enclitic ‘llu,’ shown above, which has a basic meaning of ‘and.’

=== Bases ===

The base forms the lexical core of the word and belongs to one of three main classes: noun bases, verb bases and particle bases.
* Noun bases (N)
** Ordinary noun bases (intransitive, transitive)
** Independent pronoun bases (intransitive)
** Demonstrative bases (D) (intransitive)
** Adjectival noun bases
*** Inflecting as ordinary noun bases (intransitive, transitive)
*** Independent relative bases
*** Quantificational bases (Q)
**** Numeral (NM) bases: cardinal (intransitive); ordinal (transitive)
**** Specifier (SP) bases: cardinal (intransitive); partitive (transitive)
** Locational bases
*** Demonstrative adverb (DA) bases (intransitive)
*** Positional (PS) bases (transitive)
** Temporal bases
*** Temporal noun bases (intransitive, transitive)
*** Temporal particle bases
* Verb bases (V)
** Exclusively intransitive (Vi)
** Exclusively transitive (Vt)
** Ambivalent
* Particles
** Independent particles
** Sentence particles
** Phrasal participles
** Enclitics

Noun endings indicate number (singular, dual, or plural), case, and whether or not the noun is possessed. If the noun is possessed, the ending indicates the number and person of the possessor. Siberian Yupik has seven noun cases:

# absolutive
# relative (ergative-genitive)
# ablative-modalis
# localis
# terminalis
# vialis
# aequalis

===Absolutive Case Noun Endings===

As in other ergative-absolutive languages, absolutive case is used to mark nouns that are generally the subjects of intransitive verbs or the objects of transitive verbs.

===Relative/Ergative Case Noun Endings===

Ergative case identifies nouns as a subject of a transitive verb and acts as the genitive form in ergative-absolutive languages.

===Ablative-Modalis Case Noun Endings===

The ablative case is used to indicate the agent in passive sentences, or the instrument, manner, or place of the action described by the verb.

The endings of the locative and terminative cases are the same as those of the ablative case except that the locative case has &quot;-mi&quot; and &quot;-ni&quot; and the terminative case has &quot;-mun&quot; and &quot;-nun&quot; in place of the &quot;-meng&quot; and &quot;-neng&quot; at the end of the ablative case endings.

===Prolative Case Noun Endings===

In grammar, the prolative case, also called the vialis case, is a grammatical case of a noun or pronoun that expresses motion by the referent of the noun it marks.

===Equative Noun Case Endings===

Equative is a case that expresses the standard of comparison of equal values.

=== Postbases ===

Derivation is accomplished in CSY by attaching suffixes called postbases. Productivity in the context of CSY is defined as the free addition of a postbase to any base without an unpredictable semantic result; non-productivity implies that said postbases cannot combine freely but are limited to attaching to only a particular set of bases. Postbases are either nominal or verbal and select nominal or verbal bases or expanded bases to attach to (an expanded base is a base followed by one or more postbases). There are four kinds of postbases:

# VN: postbases deriving nouns from verbs
# NV: postbases deriving verbs from nouns
# NN: postbases constructing complex nouns
# VV: postbases constructing complex verbs

These postbases can indicate a wide variety of meaning, including:

For nouns:

* quantification,
* adjectival modification,
* being and becoming,
* a type of verbal noun-incorporation

For verbs: 
* changes in transitivity,
* adverbial modification,
* evidentially,
* negation,
* tense,
* agent noun formation,
* relative clause formation,
* various types of verbal complementation

It is estimated that CSY has approximately 547 postbases: 75 NN, 55 NV, 30 VN, and 387 VV. It appears that in CSY the large majority of NN, NV, and VN postbases are productive; for the VV postbases, there are approximately 190 non-productive ones and 197 productive ones.

====Characteristics of polysynthetic postbases====

There are no clear morphological position classes in CSY. A position class is the organization of morphemes or a morpheme class into a linear ordering with no apparent connection to syntactic, semantic, or phonological representation. In the example below, it is semantic restrictions that dictate the order.

Some postbases can be used recursively, as in the example below.

Recursion can also be used for emphasis.

There is variability in postbase ordering with no change in semantic outcome.


&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
V:verb
FRUSTR:frustrative aspect (‘but ... in vain’)
INFER:inferential evidential (often translatable as ‘it turns out’)
3S3S:third-person subject acting on third-person object
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;

Note: there is a general rule in CSY of semantic scope in which the rightmost postbase will have scope over the left. However, there are many exceptions, as in the example above.

===Enclitics===

Following are a brief list and description of enclitics in CSY. The table is recreated from de Reuse (1988).

# : modal function, interrogative 
# : modal function, optative 
# : modal function, exhortative or exclamative 
# : evidential function 
# : focus marking or conjunction 
# : can be interrogative; sometimes marks a perlocutionary act 
# : mark illocutionary acts 
# : mark the “presupposition that the hearer is unaware that the speaker lacks crucial information” 
# : shifts the attention of the hearer

Note: the ‘position’ references above refer to the position of the postbase following the main base.

== Other Eskimo languages spoken in Chukotka ==

=== Other Yupik languages ===

Naukan, or Nuvuqaghmiistun, the second largest Yupik language spoken in Chukotka, is spoken in settlements including Uelen, Lorino, Lavrentiya, and Provideniya.

=== Debated classifications ===

Additionally, the Sireniki Eskimo language, locally called Uqeghllistun, was an Eskimo language once spoken in Chukotka. It had many peculiarities. Sometimes it is classified as not belonging to the Yupik branch at all, thus forming (by itself) a stand-alone third branch of the Eskimo languages (alongside Inuit and Yupik). Its peculiarities may be the result of a supposed long isolation from other Eskimo groups in the past.

Sireniki became extinct in early January 1997.

<doc id="871784" wikidata="Q1130762" url="?curid=871784" title="Parmenides (dialogue)">
<text>Parmenides () is one of the dialogues of Plato. It is widely considered to be one of the most challenging and enigmatic of Plato&#x27;s dialogues.
The &quot;Parmenides&quot; purports to be an account of a meeting between the two great philosophers of the Eleatic school, Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, and a young Socrates. The occasion of the meeting was the reading by Zeno of his treatise defending Parmenidean monism against those partisans of plurality who asserted that Parmenides&#x27; supposition that there is a &quot;one&quot; gives rise to intolerable absurdities and contradictions. The dialogue is set during a supposed meeting between Parmenides and Zeno of Elea in Socrates&#x27; hometown of Athens. This dialogue is chronologically the earliest of all as Socrates is only nineteen years old here. It is also notable that he takes the position of the student here while Parmenides serves as the lecturer. 

Most scholars agree that the dialogue does not record historic conversations, and is most likely an invention by Plato.
==Discussion with Socrates==
The heart of the dialogue opens with a challenge by Socrates to the elder and revered Parmenides and Zeno. Employing his customary method of attack, the reductio ad absurdum, Zeno has argued that if as the pluralists say things are many, then they will be both like and unlike; but this is an impossible situation, for unlike things cannot be like, nor like things unlike. But this difficulty vanishes, says Socrates, if we are prepared to make the distinction between sensibles on one hand and Forms, in which sensibles participate, on the other. Thus one and the same thing can be both like and unlike, or one and many, by participating in the Forms of Likeness and Unlikeness, of Unity and Plurality; I am one man, and as such partake of the Form of Unity, but I also have many parts and in this respect I partake of the Form of Plurality. There is no problem in demonstrating that sensible things may have opposite attributes; what would cause consternation, and earn the admiration of Socrates, would be if someone were to show that the Forms themselves were capable of admitting contrary predicates.

At this point, Parmenides takes over as Socrates&#x27; interlocutor and dominates the remainder of the dialogue. After establishing that Socrates himself has made the distinction between Forms and sensibles, Parmenides asks him what sorts of Form he is prepared to recognize. Socrates replies that he has no doubt about the existence of mathematical, ethical and aesthetic Forms (e.g., Unity, Plurality, Goodness, Beauty), but is unsure of Forms of Man, Fire and Water; he is almost certain, though admits to some reservations, that undignified objects like hair, mud and dirt do not have Forms. Parmenides suggests that when he is older and more committed to philosophy, he will consider all the consequences of his theory, even regarding seemingly insignificant objects like hair and mud.

For the remainder of the first part of the dialogue, Parmenides draws Socrates out on certain aspects of the Theory of Forms and in the process brings to bear five arguments against the theory.

Argument 1. (130e–131e) If particular things come to partake of the Form of Beauty or Likeness or Largeness they thereby become beautiful or like or large. Parmenides presses Socrates on how precisely many particulars can participate in a single Form. On one hand, if the Form as a whole is present in each of its many instances, then it would as a whole be in numerically different places, and thus separate from itself. Socrates suggests that the Form might be like a day, and thus present in many things at once. Parmenides counters that this would be little different from a single sail covering a number of people, wherein different parts touch different individuals; consequently, the Form is many.

Argument 2. (132a–b) Socrates&#x27; reason for believing in the existence of a single Form in each case is that when he views a number of (say) large things, there appears to be a single character which they all share, &quot;viz.&quot; the character of Largeness. But considering the series of large things; x, y, z, Largeness itself, the latter is also in some sense considered to be large, and if all members of this series partake of a single Form, then there must be another Largeness in which large things and the first Form of Largeness partake. But if this second Form of Largeness is also large, then there should be a third Form of Largeness over the large things and the first two Forms, and so on &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. Hence, instead of there being one Form in every case, we are confronted with an indefinite number. This Largeness regress is commonly known under the name given to it by Aristotle, the famous Third Man Argument (TMA).

Argument 3. (132b–c) To the suggestion that each Form is a thought existing in a soul, thus maintaining the unity of the Form, Parmenides replies that a thought must be a thought of something that is a Form. Thus we still have to explain the participation relation. Further, if things share in Forms which are no more than thoughts, then either things consist of thoughts and think, or else they are thoughts, yet do not think.

Argument 4. (132c–133a) Socrates now suggests that the Forms are patterns in nature (παραδείγματα &quot;paradeigmata&quot; &quot;paradigms&quot;) of which the many instances are copies or likenesses. Parmenides argues that if the many instances are like the Forms, then the Forms are like their instances. Yet if things are like, then they come to be like by participating in Likeness; therefore Likeness is like the likeness in concrete things, and another regress is generated.

Argument 5. (133a–134e) Called the &quot;great difficulty [ἀπορία]&quot; (133a) by Parmenides, the theory of Forms arises as a consequence of the assertion of the separate existence of the Forms. Forms do not exist in our world but have their being with reference to one another in their own world. Similarly, things of our world are related among themselves, but not to Forms. Just as Mastership has its being relative to Slavery, so mastership in our world has its being relative to slavery in our world. No terrestrial master is master of Slave itself, and no terrestrial master-slave relation has any relationship to the ideal Master-Slave relation. And so it is with knowledge. All our knowledge is such with respect to our world, not to the world of the Forms, while ideal Knowledge is knowledge of the things not of our world but of the world of the Forms. Hence, we cannot know the Forms. What is more, the gods who dwell in the divine world, can have no knowledge of us, and nor can their ideal mastership rule us.

In spite of Socrates&#x27; inability to defend the theory against Parmenides&#x27; arguments, in the following transitional section of the dialogue Parmenides himself appears to advocate the theory. He insists that without Forms there can be no possibility of dialectic, and that Socrates was unable to uphold the theory because he has been insufficiently exercised. There follows a description of the kind of exercise, or training, that Parmenides recommends.

The remainder of the dialogue is taken up with an actual performance of such an exercise, where a young Aristoteles (later a member of the Thirty Tyrants, not to be confused with Plato&#x27;s eventual student Aristotle), takes the place of Socrates as Parmenides&#x27; interlocutor.

==Discussion with Aristoteles==
This difficult second part of the dialogue is generally agreed to be one of the most challenging, and sometimes bizarre, pieces in the whole of the Platonic corpus. One of the second part is &quot;whether Plato was committed to any of the arguments developed in the second part of the dialogue.&quot; It consists of an unrelenting series of difficult and subtle arguments, where the exchange is stripped of all but the bare essentials of the arguments involved. Gone are the drama and colour we are accustomed to from earlier dialogues.

The second part of the dialogue can be divided thus:

Hypothesis/Deduction n. 1 (137c-142a): If it is one. The one cannot be made up of parts, because then the one would be made of many. Nor can it be a whole, because wholes are made of parts. Thus the one has no parts and is not a whole. It has not a beginning, a middle nor an end because these are parts, it is therefore unlimited. It has no shape because it is neither linear nor circular: a circle has parts all equidistant from the centre, but the one has no parts nor a centre; It is not a line because a line has a middle and two extremes, which the one cannot have. Thus the one has no shape. The one cannot be in anything nor in itself. If it was in another it would be all surrounded and by what it is inside and would be touched at many parts by what contains it, but the one has no parts and thus cannot be inside something else. If it were in itself it would contain itself, but if it is contained then it is different from what contains it and thus the one would be two. The one cannot move because movement is change or change in position. It cannot change because it has no parts to change. If it moves position it moves either circularly or linearly. If it spins in place its outer part revolves around its middle but the one has neither. If it moves its position it moves through something else, which it cannot be inside. Thus the one does not move. The one must be itself and cannot be different from it. The one does not take part in the flowing of time so it is imperishable.

Hypothesis/Deduction n. 2 (142b–155e): If the one is. The one is, it must be and it is part of being. The one is part of being and vice versa. Being is a part of the one, the one is a whole that is a group of sections. The one does not participate in the being, so it must be a single part. Being is unlimited and is contained in everything, however big or small it is. So, since the one is part of being, it is divided into as many parts as being, thus it is unfinished. The parts are themselves sections of a whole, the whole is delimited, confirming the presence of a beginning, a centre, and an end. Therefore, since the centre is itself at the same distance from the beginning and the end, the one must have a form: linear, spherical, or mixed. If the whole is in some of its parts, it will be the plus into the minus, and different from itself. The one is also elsewhere, it is stationary and in movement at the same time.

The Appendix to the First Two Deductions 155e–157b

Hypothesis/Deduction n. 3 (157b–159b): If the one is not. If the one is not it participates in everything different from it, so everything is partially one. Similarity, dissimilarity, bigness, equality and smallness belong to it since the one is similar to itself but dissimilar to anything that is, but it can be big or small as regards dissimilarity and equal as concerns similarity. So the one participates of non-being and also of being because you can think of it. Therefore, the one becomes and perishes and, since it participates of non-being, stays. The one removes from itself the contraries so that it is unnameable, not disputable, not knowable or sensible or showable. The other things appear one and many, limited and unlimited, similar and dissimilar, the same and completely different, in movement and stationary, and neither the first nor the latter thing since they are different from the one and other things. Eventually they are not. So if the one is not, being is not.

A satisfactory characterisation of this part of the dialogue has eluded scholars since antiquity. Many thinkers have tried, among them Cornford, Russell, Ryle, and Owen; but few would accept without hesitation any of their characterisations as having got to the heart of the matter. Recent interpretations of the second part have been provided by Miller (1986), Meinwald (1991), Sayre (1996), Allen (1997), Turnbull (1998), Scolnicov (2003), and Rickless (2007). It is difficult to offer even a preliminary characterisation, since commentators disagree even on some of the more rudimentary features of any interpretation. Benjamin Jowett did maintain in the introduction to his translation of the book that the dialogue was certainly not a Platonic refutation of the Eleatic doctrine. In fact, it could well be an Eleatic assessment of the theory of Forms. It might even mean that the Eleatic monist doctrine wins over the pluralistic contention of Plato. The discussion, at the very least, concerns itself with topics close to Plato&#x27;s heart in many of the later dialogues, such as Being, Sameness, Difference, and Unity; but any attempt to extract a moral from these passages invites contention.

The structure of the remainder of the dialogue:

The Fourth Deduction 159b–160b

The Fifth Deduction 160b–163b

The Sixth Deduction 163b–164b

The Seventh Deduction 164b–165e

The Eighth Deduction 165e–166c

==Third man argument==
Plato&#x27;s theory of Forms, as it is presented in such dialogues as the &quot;Phaedo&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot; and the first part of the &quot;Parmenides&quot;, seems committed to the following principles: &quot;F&quot; stands for any Form (&quot;appearance, property&quot;)—&quot;forma&quot; is a Boethian translation for εἶδος (&quot;eidos&quot;), which is the word that Plato used. Plato, in the &quot;Parmenides&quot;, uses the example &quot;greatness&quot; (μέγεθος) for &quot;F-ness&quot;; Aristotle uses the example &quot;man&quot;.

*One-over-many: For any plurality of F things, there is a form of F-ness by virtue of partaking of which each member of that plurality is F.
*Self-predication: Every form of F-ness is itself F.
*Non-self-partaking: No form partakes of itself.
*Uniqueness: For any property F, there is exactly one form of F-ness.
*Purity: No form can have contrary properties.
*One/many: The property of being one and the property of being many are contraries.
*Oneness: Every form is one.

However, the TMA shows that these principles are mutually contradictory, as long as there is a plurality of things that are F:

(In what follows, μέγας [&quot;megas&quot;; &quot;great&quot;] is used as an example; however, the argumentation holds for any F.)

Begin, then, with the assumption that there is a plurality of great things, say (A, B, C). By one-over-many, there is a form of greatness (say, G1) by virtue of partaking of which A, B, and C are great. By self-predication, G1 is great. 

But then we can add G1 to (A, B, C) to form a new plurality of great things: (A, B, C, G1). By one-over-many, there is a form of greatness (say, G2) by virtue of partaking of which A, B, C, and G1 are great. But in that case G1 partakes of G2, and by Non-Self-Partaking, G1 is not identical to G2. So there are at least two forms of greatness, G1 and G2. This already contradicts Uniqueness, according to which there is exactly one (and hence no more than one) form of greatness.

But it gets worse for the theory of Forms. For by Self-Predication, G2 is great, and hence G2 can be added to (A, B, C, G1) to form a new plurality of great things: (A, B, C, G1, G2). By One-Over-Many, there is a form of greatness (say, G3) by virtue of partaking of which A, B, C, G1, and G2 are great. But in that case G1 and G2 both partake of G3, and by Non-Self-Partaking, neither of G1 and G2 is identical to G3. So there must be at least three forms of greatness, G1, G2, and G3.

Repetition of this reasoning shows that there is an infinite hierarchy of forms of greatness, with each form partaking of the infinite number of forms above it in the hierarchy. According to Plato, anything that partakes of many things must itself be many. So each form in the infinite hierarchy of forms of greatness is many. But then, given Purity and One/Many, it follows that each form in the infinite hierarchy of forms of greatness is not one. This contradicts Oneness.

==Legacy==
The third man argument was furthered by Aristotle (&quot;Metaphysics&quot; 990b17–1079a13, 1039a2; &quot;Sophistic Refutations&quot; 178b36 ) who, rather than using the example of &quot;greatness&quot; (μέγεθος), used the example of a man (hence the name of the argument) to explain this objection to the theory, which he attributes to Plato; Aristotle posits that if a man is a man because he partakes in the form of man, then a third form would be required to explain how man and the form of man are both man, and so on, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.

===Ancient commentaries===

The &quot;Parmenides&quot; was the frequent subject of commentaries by Neoplatonists. Important examples include those of Proclus and of Damascius, and an anonymous 3rd or 4th commentary possibly due to Porphyry. The 13th century translation of Proclus&#x27; commentary by Dominican friar William of Moerbeke stirred subsequent medieval interest (Klibansky, 1941). In the 15th century, Proclus&#x27; commentary influenced the philosophy of Nicolas of Cusa, and Neoplatonists Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Marsilio Ficino penned major commentaries. According to Ficino:

===Contemporary interpretations===
Some scholars (including Gregory Vlastos) believe that the third man argument is a &quot;record of honest perplexity&quot;. Other scholars think that Plato means us to reject one of the premises that produces the infinite regress (namely, One-Over-Many, Self-Predication, or Non-Self-Partaking). But it is also possible to avoid the contradictions by rejecting Uniqueness and Purity (while accepting One-Over-Many, Self-Predication, and Non-Self-Partaking).

<text>William George Barker, (3 November 1894 – 12 March 1930) was a Canadian First World War fighter ace and Victoria Cross recipient. He is the most decorated serviceman in the history of Canada.

==Early life==
Born on a family farm in Dauphin, Manitoba, &quot;Will&quot; Barker grew up on the frontier of the Great Plains, riding horses, shooting, and working as a youngster on his father&#x27;s farm and sawmill. He was an exceptional shot, using a lever-action Winchester that he had modified with his own iron sight. He was particularly adept at shooting on the move, even while on horseback. One biographer has suggested that he could have been a trick shooter in a circus. He was physically poised, emotionally intense, with wide-ranging interests, and had an innate flair for the dramatic act. He was a very good student in school, but had frequent absences due to farm and sawmill life; he was the hunter providing food for the workers in the sawmill while still a young teenager, and missed classes because of this obligation. Barker was a Boy Scout at Russell, Manitoba, and a member of the 32nd Light Horse, a Non-Permanent Active Militia unit based at Roblin, Manitoba. He was in Grade 11 at Dauphin Collegiate Institute in the fall of 1914, just before his enlistment.

==First World War==
In December 1914, soon after the outbreak of the First World War and the subsequent call to arms in the Dominion of Canada, Barker enlisted as No &quot;106074&quot; Trooper William G. Barker in the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles. The regiment went to England in June 1915 and then to France on 22 September of that year. Barker was a Colt machine gunner with the regiment&#x27;s machine gun section until late February or early March 1916, when he transferred as a probationary observer to 9 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps, flying in Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 aircraft.

===Western Front 1916–1917===
He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in April and was given five days&#x27; leave in London to acquire an officer&#x27;s uniform and equipment. On his return, he was assigned to 4 Squadron and on 7 July transferred to 15 Squadron, still flying in the B.E.2. On 21 July Barker claimed a Roland scout &quot;driven down&quot; with his observer&#x27;s gun, and in August claimed a second Roland, this time in flames. He was mentioned in despatches around this time. He officially qualified as an Observer on 27 August, and on 15 September he worked for the first time with Canadian troops, including his old regiment. On 15 November, Barker and his pilot, flying very low over the Ancre River, spotted a large concentration of German troops massing for a counter-attack on Beaumont Hamel. The crew sent an emergency Zone Call which brought to bear all available artillery fire in the area onto the specified target. The force of some 4,000 German infantry was effectively broken up. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for this action in the concluding stages of the Battle of the Somme.
In January 1917, after spending Christmas on leave in London, he commenced pilot training at Netheravon, Wiltshire, flying solo after 55 minutes of dual instruction. On 24 February 1917, he returned to serve a second tour on Corps Co-operation machines as a pilot flying B.E.2s and R.E.8s with 15 Squadron. On 25 March, Barker claimed another scout &quot;driven down&quot;. On 25 April 1917 during the Arras Offensive, Barker, flying an R.E.8 with observer Lt. Goodfellow, spotted over 1,000 German troops sheltering in support trenches. The duo directed artillery fire into the positions, thereby avoiding a counter-attack.

After being awarded a bar to his MC in July, Barker was wounded in the head by anti-aircraft fire in August 1917. After a short spell in the UK as an instructor, Barker&#x27;s continual requests for front-line service resulted in him being transferred to become a scout pilot, being offered a post with either 56 Squadron or 28 Squadron. He chose command of C Flight in the newly formed 28 Squadron, flying the Sopwith Camel that he preferred over the S.E.5s of 56 Squadron. Although Barker was reportedly not a highly skilled pilot – suffering several flying accidents during his career – he compensated for this deficiency with aggressiveness in action and highly accurate marksmanship.

The unit moved to France on 8 October 1917. Barker downed an Albatros D.V on his first patrol, though he did not claim it as the patrol was unofficial. He claimed an Albatros of &quot;Jasta 2&quot; (Lt. Lange, killed) on 20 October, and two more, of &quot;Jasta 18&quot;, on 27 October (Lt. Schober killed, Offstv. Klein, force landed).

===Italian Front 1917–1918===
On 7 November 1917, 28 Squadron was transferred to Italy with Barker temporarily in command; most of the unit, including aircraft, travelled by train to Milan. On 29 November he downed an Austrian Albatros D.III flown by Lt. Haertl of &quot;Jasta 1&quot; near Pieve di Soligo. A &quot;Jasta 39&quot; pilot was shot down and killed and a balloon of &quot;BK 10&quot; was destroyed on 3 December.

One of his most successful, and also most controversial raids – fictionalized by Ernest Hemingway in the short story &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; – was on 25 December 1917. Catching the Germans off guard, he and Lt. Harold B. Hudson, his wingman, shot up the airfield of &quot;Fliegerabteilung&quot; (A) 204, setting fire to one hangar and damaging four German aircraft before dropping a placard wishing their opponents a &quot;Happy Christmas.&quot;
Lt. Lang of &quot;Jasta 1&quot; was killed by Barker on 1 January 1918, and two balloons, two Albatros fighters (one flown by &quot;Feldwebel&quot; Karl Semmelrock of &quot;Flik 51J&quot;) and a pair of two-seaters fell to Barker during February. Awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in March, he also claimed three more Albatroses and an observation balloon.

Owing to his tendency to ignore orders by flying many unofficial patrols, Barker was passed over when the post of Commanding Officer of 28 Squadron became vacant. Dissatisfied, he applied for a posting and joined 66 Squadron in April 1918, where he claimed a further 16 victories by mid-July.

On 17 April, he shot down Oblt. Gassner-Norden of &quot;Flik 41J&quot;, flying an Albatros D.III (OEF), over Vittorio. He then became Squadron Commander of 139 Squadron, flying the Bristol Fighter. Barker, however, took his Sopwith Camel with him and continued to fly fighter operations. He carried out an unusual sortie on the night of 9 August when he flew a Savoia-Pomilio SP.4 bomber to land a spy behind enemy lines.
By this time, his personal Sopwith Camel (serial no. B6313) had become the most successful fighter aircraft in the history of the RAF, Barker having used it to shoot down 46 aircraft and balloons from September 1917 to September 1918, for a total of 404 operational flying hours. It was dismantled in October 1918, Barker keeping the clock as a memento, although he was asked to return it the following day. During this time, Barker trialled a series of modifications to B6313, to improve its combat performance. The Clerget rotary engine&#x27;s cooling efficiency was poorer in the hotter Italian climate, so several supplementary cooling slots were cut into the cowling. The poor upward visibility of the Camel resulted in Barker cutting away progressively larger portions of the centre-section fabric. He also had a rifle-type, notch and bead gun-sight arrangement to replace the standard gunsight fitting.

Having flown more than 900 combat hours in two and a half years, Barker was transferred back to the UK in September 1918 to command the fighter training school at Hounslow Heath Aerodrome. Barker ended his Italian service with some 33 aircraft claimed destroyed and nine observation balloons downed, individually or with other pilots.
===Victoria Cross===
In London at RAF HQ, he persuaded his superiors he needed to get up to date on the latest combat techniques in France and he was granted a 10-day roving commission in France. He selected the Sopwith Snipe as his personal machine and attached himself to No. 201 Squadron RAF, whose commander, Major Cyril Leman, was a friend from his days as a Corps Co-operation airman. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on Sunday, 27 October 1918, day 10 of his roving commission.

While returning his Snipe to an aircraft depot, he crossed enemy lines at 21,000 feet above the Forêt de Mormal. He attacked an enemy Rumpler two-seater which broke up, its crew escaping by parachute (the aircraft was of &quot;FAA 227&quot;, Observer Lt. Oskar Wattenburg killed). By his own admission, he was careless and was bounced by a formation of Fokker D.VIIs of &quot;Jagdgruppe 12&quot;, consisting of &quot;Jasta 24&quot; and &quot;Jasta 44&quot;, in a descending battle against 15 or more enemy machines. The dogfight took place immediately above the lines of the Canadian Corps. Severely wounded and bleeding profusely, Barker force-landed inside Allied lines, his life being saved by the men of an RAF Kite Balloon Section who transported him to a field dressing station. The fuselage of his Snipe aircraft was recovered from the battlefield and is preserved at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa, Ontario. He is credited with shooting down the Rumpler and three Fokker DVIIs; German reports acknowledge a casualty: &quot;27/10/18 Jasta 44 Ltn. Hinky is WIA and to hospital&quot;. A possible related casualty was Jasta 24 Vfw Schymik, killed in action, while Barker may have been shot down by Js 24&#x27;s Ostv Friedrich Altemeier.

At a hospital in Rouen, France, Barker clung to life until mid-January 1919, and then was transported back to England. He was not fit enough to walk the necessary few paces for the VC investiture at Buckingham Palace until 1 March 1919.

Barker is officially credited with one captured, two (and seven shared) balloons destroyed, 33 (and two shared) aircraft destroyed, and five aircraft &quot;out of control&quot;, the highest &quot;destroyed&quot; tally for any RAF, RFC, or RNAS pilot during the conflict. The Overseas Military Forces of Canada recognized Barker as &quot;holding the record for fighting decorations&quot; awarded in the First World War.

===Most decorated hero===
Barker returned to Canada in May 1919 as the most decorated Canadian of the war, with the Victoria Cross, the Distinguished Service Order and Bar, the Military Cross and two Bars, two Italian Silver Medals for Military Valour, and the French Croix de guerre. He was also mentioned in despatches three times. The &quot;Canadian Daily Record&quot;, a publication of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada, wrote in December 1918 that William Barker of Dauphin, Manitoba was the Canadian holding the record for &quot;most fighting decorations&quot; in the war. No other Canadian soldier, sailor or airman has surpassed this record, and the Canadian War Museum exhibit, located in Ottawa, Ontario, states: &quot;Lieutenant Colonel William G. Barker, one of the legendary aces of the war, remains the most decorated Canadian in military service&quot;. A plaque on his tomb in the mausoleum of Toronto&#x27;s Mount Pleasant Cemetery, officially unveiled on 22 September 2011, describes him as &quot;The most decorated war hero in the history of Canada, the British Empire, and the Commonwealth of Nations&quot;. Only two other servicemen in the history of the Commonwealth or Empire have received as many British medals for gallantry. These were Mick Mannock and James McCudden and, like Barker, both were &quot;scout pilots&quot; in the First World War. Barker, Mannock, and McCudden each received six British medals, including the Victoria Cross. McCudden was also awarded a French Croix de Guerre. But with his three foreign medals and three mentions in despatches, Barker received a total of 12 awards for valor.

==Post-war==
Barker formed a business partnership, Bishop-Barker Aeroplanes Limited, with fellow Victoria Cross recipient and Canadian ace Billy Bishop which lasted for about three years. In 1922 he rejoined the fledgling Canadian Air Force in the rank of Wing Commander, serving as the Station Commander of Camp Borden from 1922 to 1924.

Barker was appointed acting director of the RCAF in early 1924 and he graduated from RAF Staff College, Andover, England, in 1926. While waiting to start RAF Staff College Course No 4, Barker spent two weeks in Iraq with the RAF to learn more about the uses of airpower. He formally reported on his findings to the Minister of National Defence, and informally to Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, of the US Air Service. One of his achievements in the RCAF was the introduction of parachutes. After leaving the RCAF he became the first president of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club and was involved in tobacco-growing farms in southwestern Ontario.

Barker continued to suffer from the physical effects of his 1918 gunshot wounds: his legs were permanently damaged and he suffered severely limited movement in his left arm. He also struggled with alcoholism in the last few years of his life. He died in 1930 when he lost control of his Fairchild KR-21 biplane trainer during a demonstration flight for the RCAF, at Air Station Rockcliffe, near Ottawa, Ontario. Barker, aged 35, was at the time the President and general manager of Fairchild Aircraft in Montreal.

==Legacy==

His funeral, the largest national state event in Toronto&#x27;s history, was attended by an honour guard of 2,000 soldiers. The cortège stretched for more than a mile and a half, and it included the Chief of the General Staff and his senior officers, the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, the Mayor of Toronto, three federal government cabinet ministers, and six other Victoria Cross recipients. An honour guard was also provided by the United States Army. Some 50,000 spectators lined the streets of Toronto en route to Mount Pleasant Cemetery, where Barker was entombed in his wife&#x27;s family crypt at the Mausoleum.

On 6 June 1931, an airfield in Toronto was renamed Barker Field in his memory. At CFB Borden in Ontario, an elementary school was named after Barker before its closure in the mid-1990s.

In his hometown of Dauphin, Manitoba, an elementary school and the Barker Airport (dedicated in 1998) are named in his honour. The Dauphin squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets is named for Barker.

During the week of 8 January 1999, the Canadian federal government designated Barker a person of national historic significance. The Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Flightpath&quot; series, a television documentary, included an episode entitled &quot;First of the Few&quot;, a biography of Barker, which was broadcast on 27 April 1999 in Canada. In 2003, History TV broadcast &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Hero – The Forgotten Life of William Barker.&quot;

Barker&#x27;s only daughter, Jean Antoinette Mackenzie (née Barker), died in July 2007. A memorial at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto was unveiled on 22 September 2011 to mark Barker as the &quot;most decorated war hero in the history of Canada, the British Empire, and the Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; In 2012, Southport Aerospace Centre named its new flight student accommodation building after him.

In October 2021, it was announced that the UK&#x27;s seventh Poseidon MRA1 maritime patrol aircraft would be known as &quot;William Barker VC&quot;.

<text>Kate Seredy (November 10, 1899 – March 7, 1975) was an American writer and illustrator of children&#x27;s books. She won the Newbery Medal once, the Newbery Honor twice, the Caldecott Honor once, and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award. Most of her books were written in English, which was not her first language. Seredy seems to be unknown (and untranslated) in her native Hungary, despite the fact that her story of the Good Master, and the sequel set in World War I are intensely about Hungary.

== Life ==
Kate Seredy was born on November 10, 1899 in Budapest, Hungary. She was the only child of a schoolteacher, Louis Peter Seredy, and his wife, Anna Ireny. Seredy received a diploma to teach art from the Academy of Arts in Budapest. During World War I Seredy traveled to Paris and worked as a combat nurse. After the war she illustrated several books in Hungary.

In 1922 Seredy moved from Budapest to the United States. She studied English language, working as an illustrator and artist to support herself, while preparing to illustrate children&#x27;s books. From 1933 to 1934 Seredy owned a children&#x27;s bookstore. Though the store wasn&#x27;t a success, she later credited it with helping her understand children and what makes a good children&#x27;s book. In 1935 Seredy met May Massee, the children&#x27;s editor at Viking Press. Massee didn&#x27;t have any illustration work for Seredy, but encouraged her to write about her childhood in Hungary, promising to publish the book for Christmas. After several months of work, Seredy submitted what would become &quot;The Good Master&quot;, which she also illustrated. Though not autobiographical, Seredy did spend her summers as a child on the plains of Hungary. She used many of her impressions and experiences in the story about young Kate, who is sent by her widowed father from Budapest to the country to live with her Uncle and his family. &quot;The Good Master&quot; was named a Newbery Honor book in 1935, a runner-up to &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot;, which Seredy illustrated for Simon and Schuster. In addition she designed the jacket and endpapers for &quot;Young Walter Scott&quot;, which was another Newbery runner-up that year.

In 1936 Seredy wrote and illustrated &quot;Listening&quot;, set in rural New Jersey. That same year she purchased, &quot;Listening Hill&quot;, a one-hundred acre farm near Montgomery, New York. It was here that she wrote &quot;The White Stag&quot;, an historical retelling of the legends of Huns settling Hungary. Seredy learned these stories from her father when she was a child. This book, which she also illustrated, won the Newbery Award in 1938. In 1959 it received the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award.

&quot;The Singing Tree&quot; appeared in 1939. A sequel to &quot;The Good Master&quot;, it tells of the effects of World War I on Kate and all of her family. The book shows the terrible effects of war on ordinary people, especially those who are forced to leave their lands and homes to fight. &quot;The Singing Tree&quot; was also named a Newbery Honor book. Seredy continued to write and illustrate her own books as well as those of other writers. In 1945 she illustrated &quot;The Christmas Anna Angel&quot; by Ruth Sawyer. When the Caldecott Honor list was created in 1971, Seredy was retroactively named an Honor winner for those illustrations.

Seredy had twelve children&#x27;s books published, but she considered herself an illustrator before an author. She had a unique style, primarily based on drawing, and considered her books &quot;an excuse for making pictures&quot;. Her last book, &quot;Lazy Tinka&quot;, is dedicated to her long-time editor, May Massee.

Kate Seredy died on March 7, 1975, in Middletown, New York, at the age of 75. Her papers and illustrations are held at the May Massee Collection at Emporia State University, Emporia, Kansas, and the University of Oregon Library.

<doc id="871796" wikidata="Q3301455" url="?curid=871796" title="Electoral precinct">
<text>A precinct or voting district (U.S. terms), polling district (UK term) or polling division (Canadian term), is a subdivision of an electoral district, typically a contiguous area within which all electors go to a single polling place to cast their ballots.

==Canada==
In elections in Canada, the area is called a polling division. Canadian political parties do not have elections for positions representing the voters in a polling division, although parties may assign volunteers to canvass a poll, or to be an outside scrutineer pulling the vote (i.e. reminding supporters to go to vote) on Election Day or an advance polling day, or to be an inside scrutineer in the polling station noting who has come to vote so that can be communicated to an outside scrutineer.

==United Kingdom==
In elections in the United Kingdom, this subdivision is known as a polling district. It is typically a subdivision of a ward and the polling station for the voters within that polling district can be found within it. However, in urban areas where distances are short, the polling station for that district may for practical reasons be located in a neighbouring district, sharing polling place with that district&#x27;s polling station. The UK polling districts are usually the same, regardless of type of election.

==United States==
In the United States, an electoral precinct or voting district is the smallest unit into which electoral districts are divided. A larger geographic unit such as a county, township, or city council district is typically subdivided into precincts and each address is assigned to a specific precinct. Each precinct has a specific polling station where its residents go to vote; however, more than one precinct may use the same polling station. 

A 2004 survey by the United States Election Assistance Commission reported an average precinct size in the United States of approximately 1,100 registered voters. Kansas had the smallest average precinct size with 437 voters per precinct, while the District of Columbia had the largest average size at 2,704 voters per precinct.

The 2020 survey by the United States Election Assistance Commission found a total of 176,933 precincts or precinct equivalents in the United States, of which 175,441 were in the 50 states plus the District of Columbia and 1,492 were in overseas U.S. territories. 

Electoral precincts usually do not have separate governmental authorities, but there are limited exceptions in some states. In Ohio, the voters within a precinct may vote on liquor control laws that will apply only within that precinct (called &quot;local option elections&quot;). When precinct boundaries are redrawn during redistricting, the result of the vote continues to bind the areas that were formerly inside the precinct&#x27;s boundaries, although it does not bind any areas that have been newly added to the precinct since the vote. In addition, in Alabama, in those counties that have not abolished the constable system, constables are elected from individual electoral precincts.

In a political party, individuals, known by various titles such as precinct committeeman, precinct captain, or Precinct Committee Officer, are elected by ballot or county party executive committee, to represent precinct residents in every level of party operations. They report to the party on how the voters in a precinct feel about candidates and issues, and encourage people to vote.

<text>Viscount Savage was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1626 for Sir Thomas Savage, 2nd Baronet, husband of Elizabeth Savage (whom he married in 1602) and heir-apparent by special remainder to his father-in-law&#x27;s titles of Baron Darcy of Chiche (1613), Viscount Colchester (1621) and Earl Rivers (1626).

He died in 1635 before inheriting these titles, so on the death of Thomas Darcy, 1st Earl Rivers in 1640 the titles went instead to Savage&#x27;s son John, 2nd Viscount Savage, who became 2nd Earl Rivers. Thomas&#x27; widow Elizabeth was created Countess Rivers in her own right in 1641.

The Savage daughters, Dorothy and Elizabeth, were great beauties, painted by Van Dyck. Dorothy married Charles Howard, 2nd Earl of Berkshire, and Elizabeth married Sir John Thimbleby of Irnham.

The Savage viscountcy and baronetcy became extinct along with the Rivers titles in 1737.

John Savage was created baronet, of Rocksavage, Cheshire, on 29 June 1611.

<text>Waldo Brian Donlevy (February 9, 1901 – April 6, 1972) was an American actor, who was noted for playing dangerous and tough characters. Usually appearing in supporting roles, among his best-known films are &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939), &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; (1940) and &quot;Wake Island&quot; (1942). For his role as the sadistic Sergeant Markoff in &quot;Beau Geste&quot;, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

He starred as U.S. special agent Steve Mitchell in the radio/TV series &quot;Dangerous Assignment&quot;.

His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in the United Kingdom said, &quot;Any consideration of the American &#x27;film noir&#x27; of the 1940s would be incomplete without him&quot;.

==Early life==
Brian Donlevy was born on February 9, 1901, in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents were Thomas Donlevy and Rebecca (&quot;née&quot; Parks), Irish emigrants originally from Portadown, County Armagh. Sometime between 1910 and 1912, the family moved to Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, where Donlevy&#x27;s father worked as a supervisor at the Brickner Woolen Mills.

==Career==
===Broadway===
Donlevy moved to New York City in his youth, where he modeled for illustrator J. C. Leyendecker, who produced illustrations for the famous Arrow Collar advertisements. His acting career began in the early 1920s, when he began appearing in theater productions, and eventually won parts in silent films. 

He had small roles in the silent films &quot;Jamestown&quot; (1923), &quot;Damaged Hearts&quot; (1924), &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot; (1924), &quot;The Eve of the Revolution&quot; (1924), and &quot;School for Wives&quot; (1925).
He had a small role on Broadway in the play &quot;What Price Glory&quot; (1925), which was a big hit and ran for two years, establishing him as an actor. He was in the film &quot;A Man of Quality&quot; (1926).

On Broadway, he was in the popular musical &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; (1927–28), which ran for a year; then &quot;Ringside&quot; (1928), &quot;Rainbow&quot; (1928), and &quot;Queen Bee&quot; (1929). He had roles in the films &quot;Gentlemen of the Press&quot; (1929) and &quot;Mother&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1929). On stage, he appeared in &quot;Up Pops the Devil&quot; (1930–31), &quot;Peter Flies High&quot; (1931), &quot;Society Girl&quot; (1931–32), &quot;The Inside Story&quot; (1932), and &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1932). He was in a film short with Ethel Merman, &quot;Ireno&quot; (1932); and another short with Ruth Etting, &quot;A Modern Cinderella&quot; (1932).

He returned to the stage for &quot;Three And One&quot; (1933) with Lilian Bond, a big personal success; &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; (1934); &quot;The Perfumed Lady&quot; (1934); and &quot;The Milky Way&quot; (1934). The latter led to him receiving a Hollywood offer to reprise his role in the film version, but he was unable to due to a production delay. He had a final Broadway success with &quot;Life Begins at 8:40&quot; (1934) with Bert Lahr and Ray Bolger. After that show, Donlevy said &quot;they were all signed for the movies. I thought that if they can make it, I&#x27;m going to take a crack too.&quot;

===Hollywood===
Donlevy&#x27;s break came in 1935, when he was cast in the film &quot;Barbary Coast&quot;, directed by Howard Hawks and produced by Samuel Goldwyn. Later that year, he was cast in &quot;Mary Burns, Fugitive&quot;. In 1936, he received second billing in &quot;It Happened in Hollywood&quot;, and had a supporting role in Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;Strike Me Pink&quot; and Paramount&#x27;s &quot;13 Hours by Air&quot;.

===&quot;B&quot; leading man===
Donlevy had his first lead in a B movie at Fox, &quot;Human Cargo&quot; (1936), playing a wisecracking reporter opposite Claire Trevor. He followed it with other &quot;B&quot; lead roles: &quot;Half Angel&quot; (1936), &quot;High Tension&quot; (1936), &quot;36 Hours to Kill&quot; (1936), &quot;Crack-Up&quot; (1936) with Peter Lorre, and &quot;Midnight Taxi&quot; (1937).

He had a supporting role in an &quot;A&quot; movie, &quot;This Is My Affair&quot; (1937), with Robert Taylor, Barbara Stanwyck and Victor McLaglen; then starred in another &quot;B&quot;, &quot;Born Reckless&quot; (1937). He was in &quot;In Old Chicago&quot; (1938) and was teamed with Victor McLaglen in &quot;Battle of Broadway&quot; (1938) and &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Be Rich&quot; (1938). He starred in &quot;Sharpshooters&quot; (1938), and was the lead villain in the studio&#x27;s prestigious &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939).

===Paramount===
Paramount used Donlevy for a key role in Cecil B. De Mille&#x27;s &quot;Union Pacific&quot; (1939), stepping in for Charles Bickford. He stayed at that studio for &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939). His performance in &quot;Beau Geste&quot; as the ruthless Sergeant Markoff earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Donlevy went to Columbia to star in a &quot;B film&quot;, &quot;Behind Prison Gates&quot; (1939), and went to RKO for a support part in &quot;Allegheny Uprising&quot; (1939). He was the villain in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939).

Donlevy was then given the title role in &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; (1940) at Paramount, the directorial debut of Preston Sturges. It was not a big hit, but was profitable and received excellent reviews, launching Sturges&#x27; directing career. Donlevy later reprised the role several times on radio and television.

At Universal, Donlevy was in &quot;When the Daltons Rode&quot; (1940), then went into Fox&#x27;s &quot;Brigham Young: Frontiersman&quot; (1940). He was fourth-billed in &quot;I Wanted Wings&quot; (1941); then MGM borrowed him to support Robert Taylor in &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (1941). At Universal, he was top-billed in &quot;South of Tahiti&quot; (1941), and supported Bing Crosby in &quot;Birth of the Blues&quot; (1942).

Paramount gave him a star part in &quot;The Remarkable Andrew&quot; (1942), playing Andrew Jackson, then Columbia teamed him with Pat O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Two Yanks in Trinidad&quot; (1942). Edward Small hired him to play the lead in &quot;A Gentleman After Dark&quot; (1942) and he supported Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The Great Man&#x27;s Lady&quot; (1942). In 1942, he starred in &quot;Wake Island&quot; with William Bendix and Robert Preston, playing a role based on James Devereux. The film, directed by John Farrow, was a huge success, as was the adaptation of Dashiell Hammet&#x27;s classic &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942). At Universal, Donlevy starred in &quot;Nightmare&quot; (1942), and MGM borrowed him to support Taylor again in &quot;Stand By for Action&quot; (1942). Donlevy had the lead role in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Hangmen Also Die!&quot; (1943), made for United Artists and co-written by Bertolt Brecht. He had a cameo as Governor McGinty in Sturges&#x27; &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1944).

Donlevy was given the lead role in &quot;An American Romance&quot; (1944), directed by King Vidor for MGM, in a role intended for Spencer Tracy. It was a prestigious production, but the film was a box-office and critical disappointment. He had a cameo as himself in &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; (1945), and he was Trampas to Joel McCrea&#x27;s &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1946). After playing the male lead in &quot;Our Hearts Were Growing Up&quot; (1946) he was borrowed by Walter Wanger for &quot;Canyon Passage&quot; (1946).
At Paramount, he was in &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (1946), although top billing went to Alan Ladd. Donlevy was originally going to play the sadistic captain, but wound up giving that role to Howard da Silva and playing Richard Dana instead. At Paramount, Donlevy supported Ray Milland in &quot;The Trouble with Women&quot; (1947), then went to Fox to play a heroic DA in &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1947) with Victor Mature and Richard Widmark. For UA, he supported Robert Cummings in &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot; (1947), then went to MGM for the &quot;Killer McCoy&quot; (1947), a hit with Mickey Rooney; &quot;A Southern Yankee&quot; (1948) with Red Skelton; and &quot;Command Decision&quot; (1948) with Clark Gable. He supported Dorothy Lamour in &quot;The Lucky Stiff&quot; (1949) then starred in Arthur Lubin&#x27;s &quot;Impact&quot; (1949).

===Television===
He appeared on television in &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot;, and made two films for Universal-International, &quot;Shakedown&quot; (1950) and &quot;Kansas Raiders&quot; (1950) (playing William Quantrill opposite Audie Murphy&#x27;s Jesse James). He did &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot; on TV, then went to Republic for &quot;Fighting Coast Guard&quot; (1951), &quot;Ride the Man Down&quot; (1952), &quot;Hoodlum Empire&quot; (1952) and &quot;Woman They Almost Lynched&quot; (1953); then filmed &quot;Slaughter Trail&quot; (1952) for RKO.

In 1952 he produced and starred in a TV series, &quot;Dangerous Assignment&quot;, which he had performed on radio from 1949 to 1954.

Donlevy focused on television: &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;The Motorola Television Hour&quot;, &quot;Medallion Theatre&quot;, &quot;Star Stage&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Damon Runyon Theater&quot;, &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Month&quot; and &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;.

After a supporting role in &quot;The Big Combo&quot; (1955), Donlevy appeared in the British science-fiction horror film &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; (called &quot;The Creeping Unknown&quot; in the US) for Hammer Films, in the lead role of Professor Bernard Quatermass. The film was based on a 1953 BBC Television serial of the same name. The character had been British, but Hammer cast Donlevy in an attempt to help sell the film to North American audiences. Quatermass creator Nigel Kneale disliked Donlevy&#x27;s portrayal, referring to him as &quot;a former Hollywood heavy gone to seed&quot;. Nonetheless, the film was a success, and Donlevy returned for the sequel, &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; (&quot;Enemy From Space&quot; in the US), in 1957, also based on a BBC television serial. It made him the only man to play the famous scientist on screen twice (although Scottish actor Andrew Keir later played him both on film and radio).

In between the films, Donlevy was in &quot;A Cry in the Night&quot; (1956). He had the lead in a &quot;B&quot; western, &quot;Escape from Red Rock&quot; (1957) and a supporting part in &quot;Cowboy&quot; (1958). He announced that he had formed his own production company for whom he would make a western, &quot;The Golden Spur&quot;, but it appears to have not been made. He guest-starred on TV in &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Hotel de Paree&quot;, &quot;The Texan&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;, and &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;, had supporting roles in &quot;Juke Box Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Never So Few&quot; (both 1959), and had the lead in &quot;Girl in Room 13&quot; (1960). He toured on stage in a production of &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot;. He supported Jerry Lewis in &quot;The Errand Boy&quot; (1961) and Charlton Heston in &quot;The Pigeon That Took Rome&quot; (1962), and guested on &quot;&quot;, &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot;, and &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;.

===Later career===
Donlevy had the lead in &quot;Curse of the Fly&quot; (1965) for Robert L. Lippert, and supported in &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; (1965). In 1966, in one of the final episodes of &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Positive Negative&quot;, he played defendant General Roger Brandon.

Donlevy&#x27;s last performances included &quot;The Fat Spy&quot; (1966), an episode of &quot;Family Affair&quot;, new American footage shot in New York for &quot;Gamera the Invincible&quot; (1966), &quot;Five Golden Dragons&quot; (1967) for Harry Alan Towers, and the A.C. Lyles films &quot;Waco&quot; (1966), &quot;Hostile Guns&quot; (1967), &quot;Arizona Bushwhackers&quot; (1968), and &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot; (1968).

His last film was &quot;Pit Stop&quot;, released in 1969.

==Personal life==
Donlevy was married to Yvonne Grey from 1928 to 1936. She divorced him on grounds of cruelty, and he agreed to pay $5,000 a month in alimony. He married actress Marjorie Lane in 1936. They had one child, but divorced in 1947. He was married to Lillian Arch Lugosi (1911-1981) (the former wife of Bela Lugosi) from 1966 until his death in 1972.

Donlevy supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.

==Death==
Donlevy was operated on for throat cancer in 1971 and died from the disease on April 6, 1972, at the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California. He was 71. His ashes were scattered over Santa Monica Bay.

<doc id="871802" wikidata="Q688297" url="?curid=871802" title="Sonderbund War">
<text>The Sonderbund War (, , ) of November 1847 was a civil war in Switzerland, then still a relatively loose confederacy of cantons. It ensued after seven Catholic cantons formed the (&quot;separate alliance&quot;) in 1845 to protect their interests against a centralization of power. The war concluded with the defeat of the Sonderbund. It resulted in the emergence of Switzerland as a federal state, concluding the period of political &quot;restoration and regeneration&quot; in Switzerland.

The Sonderbund consisted of the cantons of Lucerne, Fribourg, Valais, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Zug, all predominantly Catholic and governed by conservative administrations. The cantons of Ticino and Solothurn, also predominantly Catholic but governed by liberal administrations, did not join the alliance.

After the (Federal Diet) declared the Sonderbund unconstitutional (October 1847) and ordered it dissolved by force, General Guillaume Henri Dufour led the federal army of 100,000 and defeated the Sonderbund forces under Johann Ulrich von Salis-Soglio in a campaign that lasted only a few weeks, from November 3 to November 29, and cost about 100 lives. Dufour ordered his troops to care for the injured, anticipating the formation of the Red Cross in which he participated a few years later. Major actions were fought at Fribourg, Geltwil (12 November), Lunnern, Lucerne, and finally at Gisikon (23 November), Meierskappel, and Schüpfheim, after which Lucerne capitulated on 24 November. The rest of the Sonderbund surrendered without armed resistance in the subsequent weeks.

==Background==
The radical (progressive liberal) Free Democratic Party of Switzerland (, ), which was mainly made up of urban bourgeoisie and burghers and was strong in the largely Protestant cantons, obtained the majority in the Federal Diet (the Tagsatzung) in the early 1840s. It proposed a new Constitution for the Swiss Confederation which would draw the several cantons into a closer relationship. In 1843, the conservative city patricians and mountain or &quot;Ur-Swiss&quot; from the largely Catholic cantons were opposed to the new constitution. These cantons combined to form the Sonderbund in 1845. In addition to the centralization of the Swiss government, the proposed new Constitution also included protections for trade and other progressive reform measures.

The Sonderbund alliance was concluded after the Federal Diet, with the approval of a majority of cantons, had taken measures against the Roman Catholic Church such as the closure of monasteries and convents in Aargau in 1841, and the seizure of their properties. When Lucerne, in retaliation, recalled the Jesuits to head its education the same year, groups of armed radicals (Freischärler) invaded the canton. This caused a revolt, mostly because rural cantons were strongholds of ultramontanism.

The liberal majority in the Tagsatzung voted to order the Sonderbund dissolved on October 21, 1847; it deemed the Sonderbund a violation of section 6 of the Federal Treaty of 1815, which expressly forbade such separate alliances. The confederate army was raised against the members of the Sonderbund. The army was composed of soldiers of all the other cantons except Neuchâtel and Appenzell Innerrhoden (which remained neutral).

By the Treaty of Vienna of 1815, the major powers guaranteed the new Swiss Constitution and had a right to intervene if they all agreed it was necessary. At this point, Austria and France were conservative Catholic powers and wanted to help the Swiss conservatives. Austria did provide some money and munitions, but bickered with France on exactly what to do. When they finally did agree, Lord Palmerston, Prime Minister of Britain, vetoed any intervention, because he favored the liberal cause and wanted the Jesuits expelled. There was no significant foreign intervention.

==Conflict==
===Preparations for war===

====Sonderbund forces====
The question of command remained long unsettled with the Sonderbund. The coalition&#x27;s strong man, Constantin Siegwart-Müller of Lucerne, first considered appointing a foreigner (Dezydery Chłapowski of Poland or Friedrich von Schwarzenberg of Austria were mentioned), but the allied council insisted on a Swiss commander. General Ludwig von Sonnenberg and Colonel Philippe de Maillardoz of Fribourg were considered, but ultimately the council elected Guillaume de Kalbermatten of Valais. After Kalbermatten declined the appointment (he would later command the troops of Valais), Colonel Jean-Ulrich de Salis-Soglio of Grisons was elected and sworn in as commander in chief on 15 January 1847. He appointed Franz von Elgger as chief of staff. Although a Protestant himself, Salis-Soglio was a staunch Conservative and an opponent of the liberal Radicals who now controlled the &quot;rump Confederation&quot;.

The Sonderbund cantons, except for Lucerne and Fribourg, sought and obtained the assent of their popular assemblies (Landsgemeinden) for general conscription. These votes occurred on September 26 (Schwyz), October 3 (Uri and Zug) and October 10 (Nidwalden, Obwalden and Valais). Troop mobilisation began on October 16 and was concluded on October 19.

Also in October, several fortifications were built on Sonderbund territory, notably in Valais, where Kalbermatten&#x27;s forces were massed by the end of October between Saint-Maurice and Saint-Gingolph, with a view of invading the Chablais of Vaud.

====Federal army====
On 21 October 1847, the Federal Diet elected General Guillaume Henri Dufour of Geneva as commander in chief of the federal army, despite his reluctance and the efforts of the Bernese government to appoint Ulrich Ochsenbein to this post. In his letter of acceptance to the Diet of October 22, Dufour emphasized that he would &quot;do everything in order to alleviate the inevitable evils of war&quot;.

On October 24, immediately prior to taking the oath of office, Dufour requested explanations concerning his orders (which were written in German) and, after an impolitic remark by the representative of Vaud, Jules Eytel, he declined the office and left the meeting of the Diet. It took two sessions behind closed doors, and a delegation of the representatives of Geneva, to convince Dufour to reconsider and to be sworn in on 25 October.

After publishing a proclamation on October 26, Dufour appointed as division commanders: Peter Ludwig von Donatz (Grisons), Johannes Burckhardt and Eduard Ziegler (Zürich) from among the Conservatives and Louis Rilliet de Constant (Vaud), Dominik Gmür, Giacomo Luvini (Ticino) and Ochsenbein (Bern) from among the Radicals. On October 30, the Diet ordered the general mobilisation of the army and, on November 4, the military execution of its decree dissolving the Sonderbund.

====Neutrals====
The cantons of Neuchâtel and Appenzell Innerrhoden, which both had a strong Catholic minority population, officially declared their neutrality in the conflict and refused to provide troops for the Confederation.

Vaud, in particular, suspected the Principality of Neuchâtel of secretly supporting the Sonderbund. Several incidents ensued, notably the capture of a lake steamship of Neuchâtel by troops from Vaud. On 29 October, Colonel Rillet-Constant asked Dufour&#x27;s permission to march on Neuchâtel. The general refused, instead asking Rillet-Constant to levy additional troops in order to make up for the defection of Neuchâtel. When the Federal Diet on October 30 formally requested Neuchâtel to supply its contingent of troops, the Principality refused. King Frederick William IV of Prussia, as Prince of Neuchâtel, eventually settled the issue by declaring the Principality &quot;neutral and inviolate&quot; during the hostilities.

The canton of Basel-Stadt resisted the requests of the Diet for a time, but ultimately provided its contingent of troops by November 6, two days after the opening of hostilities.

===Sonderbund actions in Ticino and Aargau===
The first actions were taken by the Sonderbund. Troops from Uri seized the undefended St. Gotthard Pass in the early days of November. They thereby succeeded in keeping the connection between central Switzerland and the Valais open via the Furka Pass. But contrary to triumphant proclamations in the Sonderbund newspapers, the action failed to effectively separate the federal troops under Luvini in the Ticino from those in the Grisons under Eduard de Salis-Soglio (the brother of the insurgent commander), because the San Bernardino Pass remained open to the Confederates. The first deaths of the war occurred on November 4, when an officer and a soldier from Uri were killed by the Ticinesi.

On November 7, Sonderbund forces under direct command of Jean-Ulrich de Salis-Soglio and von Elgger prepared to launch a second offensive into the Freiamt region of Aargau. After destroying a bridge over the river Reuss, they entered Aargau on November 12 in order to split the federal forces into two halves and relieve Fribourg, which was surrounded by Confederate territory. But after a few advances, they were stopped by Ziegler and retreated with losses into the canton of Lucerne.

===The Fribourg campaign===
On 9 November, Dufour launched the first offensive against Fribourg, in accordance with his general plan. Dufour chose Fribourg as his first target in part because it was geographically isolated from the other rebel cantons and in part because it was close to Bern. The former factor made it easier to confront than the other members of the &quot;Sonderbund&quot;; the latter meant that it posed a threat to the Federal Diet if it was not neutralized immediately. Moreover, Fribourg&#x27;s capture would allow Dufour to concentrate his forces in the center of the country.

By 10 and 11 November, federal troops seized the city of Estavayer-le-Lac, the enclaves of Fribourg in the canton of Vaud, and most of the district of Murten without resistance. The Fribourgeois troops under Colonel Philippe de Maillardoz retreated to defend the capital.

====The siege and surrender of Fribourg====
The Fribourgeois commander was led to anticipate an attack from the direction of Bern by the advance of a Bernese reserve division, which had been ordered to pretend to attack with a maximum of noise. Meanwhile, Dufour brought a battery of 60 guns into position, with which he intended to bring down the fortifications of the city of Fribourg.

On the morning of 13 November, with the assault ready to begin, Dufour sent a Vaudois lieutenant to Fribourg under a flag of truce. The emissary&#x27;s message revealed Dufour&#x27;s forces and plan of attack to the Fribourgeois government, and called on them to surrender in order to prevent a murderous battle. The besieged Fribourgeois asked for an armistice for the day, which Dufour accepted. But because of mistaken orders, the Vaudois troops facing the redoubt of Bertigny launched an attack against the fortress after a brief artillery exchange. They were repelled with eight dead and some fifty wounded; several defenders were also killed or wounded.

Nonetheless, on the morning of 14 November, two delegates of the governing Council of State of Fribourg brought Dufour the news of the canton&#x27;s surrender, decided by majority vote. While Confederate Switzerland rejoiced at the news, the surrender was a bitter disappointment to the Fribourgeouis troops. Many accusations of treason were raised, notably against the commander, Colonel de Maillardoz, who had to flee into exile to Neuchâtel. While it was eventually shown that the surrender had been a decision of the civil government about which de Maillardoz had not even been consulted, he remained disgraced.

====Aftermath of the Fribourg campaign====

On the evening of 14 November, the government of Valais decided to launch an offensive against Vaud in response to Fribourg&#x27;s call for help. But news of the capitulation came soon enough for the Valaisans to recall the troops and set them into motion for a manoeuvre against Ticino.

The act of surrender signed by Fribourg would become a template for the other Sonderbund cantons. With it, Fribourg undertook to leave the Sonderbund, to disarm its soldiers and to provide for the federal occupation troops. On 15 November, a new Fribourgeois government of a Radical bent was elected, who as its first act expelled the order of the Jesuits from the canton. The day after, the Vaudois commander, Colonel Rillet-Constant, had to declare a state of siege to prevent federal soldiers from pillaging and sacking the city, against the strict orders of their superiors.

On both sides of the war, the fall of Fribourg was commented on by the press and the political leaders. In Lucerne and Valais, proclamations were read to the troops, assuring them that this setback would have no effect on the coalition. Catholic newspapers doubted the news of the capitulation or claimed that the Valaisans had launched a victorious offensive into the Chablais. On the Federal side, public confidence and the morale of the army grew.

As soon as the new government was installed, Dufour left Fribourg for central Switzerland with his army. He left the western theatre of operations to Rillet-Constant, who was allowed to shift his headquarters to the Chablais, but was forbidden to take any unilateral action against Valais without Dufour&#x27;s direct order. By 15 November, the federal forces passed through Bern and reached Aarau on the evening of the 16th.

On the morning of 17 November, the troops of Uri with some reinforcements from Nidwald advanced into Ticino towards Airolo, which fell, then the day after towards Faido and on the 21st towards Biasca, where they stopped to await reinforcements. But the first to be reinforced were the Ticinesi, who received the support of some battalions from the Grisons, which arrived on the 22nd.

===The Lucerne campaign===
====Preparations and the surrender of Zug====
In Aarau, Dufour prepared his forces and his battle plan until November 20. He declined to equip his forces with Congreve rockets offered to him by the local arsenal, writing that he intended to &quot;avoid as far as possible to give this war a violent character which cannot but harm our cause.&quot;. To the surprise of both sides, the parliament of the canton of Zug voted for surrender on 21 November by a large majority. The federal troops which entered the city of Zug unopposed the day after were acclaimed by the population, and a few months later, a new government would be elected.

Dufour launched his principal offensive according to plan on November 23: The 4th (Ziegler) and the 5th divisions (Gmür) followed the Reuss valley to the south, each on one side. They were supported by the 3rd division (von Donats) descending along the Suhr until Sursee, and by the 2nd division (Burckhardt), which left Langenthal to arrive at the Reuss north of Lucerne by way of Willisau and Ruswil. The reserve artillery was concentrated on the bridgehead of Gisikon, which set up the main battle between the left bank of the Reuss and the lake of Zug, with the Lucernese troops caught between five columns of troops arriving from five different directions.

====Battle of Gisikon====

Near Gisikon, the federal army constructed several pontoon bridges to cross the Reuss. At this point, the Sonderbund commander, von Salis-Soglio, had concentrated his troops on an elevation, well-hidden behind trees and underbrush. After two federal assaults on the Sonderbund position were repulsed, Colonel Ziegler personally led his division&#x27;s third and victorious assault, later depicted in a lithograph that would become one of the war&#x27;s most well-known images. After two hours, the battle resulted in a federal victory after von Salis-Soglio, wounded in the head by a mortar detonation, ordered a retreat to Ebikon.

The battle of Gisikon was the longest and, with 37 dead and some 100 wounded, the bloodiest of the war. It is, to date, the last pitched battle in the history of the Swiss army. It was also the first battle in military history in which dedicated wagons were employed to treat the wounded on the battlefield. These horse-drawn ambulances were operated by volunteers and nurses from Zürich.

====Battle of Meierskappel====
Also on November 23, while the 2nd and 3rd federal divisions proceeded without opposition to Lucerne, the 5th division engaged troops from Schwyz near Meierskappel. The Sonderbund forces resisted for a while before retreating. This federal victory cut the connection between Lucerne and Zug, another of Dufour&#x27;s objectives. In his report to the Diet of November 23, Dufour wrote with satisfaction that the troops of Schwyz had withdrawn to the other side of Lake Zug and were now cut off from the rest of the Sonderbund army.

====Surrender of Lucerne====

The federal victories at Gisikon and Meierskappel brought federal troops within striking distance of Lucerne. On the evening of November 23, the leadership of Lucerne and the Jesuits abandoned the city and fled to Uri. On the following morning the victorious federal troops entered the city unopposed.

====Surrender of the rest of Central Switzerland====
On 26 November 1847, the Sonderbund council dissolved in Flüelen without a formal vote. Between 25–29 November federal troops moved peacefully into Central Switzerland and Valais. Unterwalden surrendered on November 25, followed by Schwyz on the following day and then Uri on November 27.

==End of the war==
The last member of the Sonderbund, Valais, surrendered on November 29 bringing the war to an end. The federal army had lost 78 men killed and had 260 wounded. Sonderbund losses were even lower. Later research arrived at 60 deaths and 386 wounded on the federal side and 33 killed and 124 wounded among the Sonderbund.

The Sonderbund governments were forced to resign and in Fribourg, Lucerne and Valais the Liberals gained power. Neuchâtel and Appenzell Innerrhoden were punished for not providing troops to the federal army. Neuchâtel paid 300,000 francs and Appenzell paid 15,000 into a fund to support war widows and orphans. By February 1848 all federal troops withdrew from the occupied cantons.

In Schwyz the conservative government was dissolved and a new provisional government and constitution established. The first attempt at a constitution, which split the district of Schwyz in two and moved the cantonal capital away from Schwyz, was narrowly defeated on 27 January 1848. The second constitution, which removed the mentioned points and merged the former districts of Wollerau and Pfäffikon in the district of March, was then approved by the electorate on 27 February 1848. The new constitution of 1848 reformed the government of the Canton. Perhaps the greatest change was that it abolished the Landsgemeinde, which had formerly been the supreme authority. It split the government into three branches, legislature, executive and judiciary and created a three-tier structure of municipalities, districts and canton. It created proportional representation and allowed the population to vote on laws and constitutional amendments.

==Aftermath: The Swiss Federal Constitution of 1848==
In 1848, a new Swiss Federal Constitution ended the almost complete independence of the cantons and transformed Switzerland into a federal state. The Jesuits were constitutionally banished from Switzerland. This Special Provision was lifted on 20 May 1973, when 54.9% of the population and 16.5 cantons out of 22 voted to approve modifying the Constitution.

<text>Noirmoutier-en-l&#x27;Île (), commonly referred to as Noirmoutier, is a commune located in the northern part of the island of Noirmoutier, just off the coast of the Vendée department in the Pays de la Loire region in western France.

== History ==

The history of the town began with the arrival of the monk Saint Philibert in 674 who founded a monastery. The Château de Noirmoutier dates from the 11th and 12th century. In summer the area is a tourist resort. The name is recorded in Latin as &quot;Nerium Monasterium&quot;, wrongly written by some as &quot;Nigrum Monasterium&quot; (&quot;Black Monastery&quot;).

In the second part of the 17th century, the island was a center of tobacco smuggling, just like Paimboeuf. Indeed, Louis XIV created in November 1674 a tobacco farm which bought tobacco from the Antilles at low prices to resell to high prices, exposing themselves to competition from tobacco from the Virginia. Imported stocks are then sold on the continent using small boats called chattes.

Until 1858, the territory of the commune extended over the whole of the island, then began to be fragmented with the creation of the commune of Barbâtre, followed, some sixty years later, in 1919, by those of La Guérinière  and from L&#x27;Épine.

==Geography==

Noirmoutier-en-l&#x27;Île is situated to the north of the island of Noirmoutier, in the Atlantic Ocean. The commune covers the northern point of the island, and contains three villages: Noirmoutier, L&#x27;Herbaudiere and Le Vieil. L&#x27;Herbaudiere is a noteworthy port and is managed by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Vendée. The inconvenient location in relation to the town and economic success of the village encouraged its inhabitants to seek the establishment of a commune independent from Noirmoutier-en-l&#x27;Île.
Le Vieil is also located on the north coast within the commune. It is a popular destination for vacationers over the summer. An inventor Brutus de Villeroi tested the first French submarine in the village on 12 August 1832. An old street bears his name.

===Climate===

Noirmoutier-en-l&#x27;Île has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) closely bordering on a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Noirmoutier-en-l&#x27;Île is . The average annual rainfall is with November as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Noirmoutier-en-l&#x27;Île was on 18 July 2022; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 16 January 1985.

==Economy==

===Cuisine===
Noirmoutier is home to the most expensive potatoes in the world. Known as &quot;La Bonnotte&quot;, only around 100 tons of this top quality potato are cultivated annually and it is harvested only on the island Noirmoutier. The cost of one kilogram can reach €500 (US $322 per pound), but the potatoes are normally sold for around €70 per kilo (US $45 per pound). The cost is attributed to the fact that this type of potato is almost extinct because it must be harvested by hand. The potato fields also require fertilization by seaweed in a climate shaped by the nearby sea. The presence of algae and seaweed in the soil is responsible for the potato&#x27;s earthy and salty flavor. Because the variety is delicate and its tuber remains attached to its stem, the potato must be picked and not torn.
 The potatoes are generally served in top class restaurants in France and the Netherlands in mid-May.

The commune was also part of the 2005, 2011 and 2018 Tour de France, including playing host to the Grand Depart in 2018.

==Landmarks==


The Château de Noirmoutier is one of the town&#x27;s major landmarks and is run by the commune government, It has been listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture since 1994.

The first traces of the castle appeared in 830 with the construction of a &quot;castrum&quot; by the abbot Hilbold, from the monastery of Saint-Philbert. It served to defend the monks and the island&#x27;s population from the Vikings.

The castle was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century by the feudal power who was trying to stabilise the region, notably by preventing Norman pillaging. The island at that time was under the control of the barons of La Garnache. The keep was built by Pierre IV of La Garnache, then an enclosure equipped with towers was built around the lower courtyard. The castle resisted numerous attacks from the English in 1342 and 1360, and again in 1386 under the command of the Earl of Arundel. It fought off the Spanish in 1524 and 1588, but in 1674, it was taken by the Dutch troops of Admiral Tromp.

In the 16th century, the castle was held by the La Trémoille family, then viscounts of Thouars. The castle was sold in 1720 to Louis IV Henri de Bourbon-Condé who resold it in 1767 to Louis XV.

During the French Revolution, the castle served as a military prison. During the 19th century, the castle was used as a barracks. In 1871, during the Paris Commune, insurgents were imprisoned there. In 1960, a house was built within the castle grounds by the governor of the island and the castle. Today, the keep houses the Noirmoutier Museum.

The keep at the centre of the castle is solid and rectangular. Built of rubble, it has three floors with the lords&#x27; residence at the top. The keep has numerous murder holes and defensive turrets at the corners. The rectangular fortification consists of two towers, a single gate and two watch turrets in the four corners. At the beginning of the 18th century, the towers were reconstructed and the keep adapted for artillery.

The Parish Church of Noirmoutier is dedicated to St. Philbert, who founded a monastery here around 674. where the monks&#x27; s had taken refuge after the invasion of Normandy in 875. A shrine at the altar contains relics of the saint and was classified as a historical monument in 1898. The church was first destroyed by the Saracens in 725 and 732. When the son of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious became King of Aquitaine, he inherited the rights to the church and in 801 ordered the reconstruction of the abbey and chapel. Forty five years later it was again destroyed by the Normans in 846. It was then rebuilt at the end of 11th century but rather more primitively than previously. Centuries later, the aisles were raised and it was consecrated in 1849. The neo-Romanesque bell tower was built in 1875 to replace the old bell tower which was destroyed by fire in 1848.

On the inside is a model frigate, made by an artisan watchmaker of the village in 1802 for Augustus Jacobsen. The church received the body of St. Philbert some time between 690 and 836, when he was transferred to Saint-Philbert-de-Grand-Lieu, where the monks had taken refuge after the invasion of Normandy in 875. A shrine at the altar contains relics of the saint and was classified as a historical monument in 1898.

*Jacobsen Dam was built in 1812 by John Cornelius Jacobsen, descendant of a family of Dutch who came to the area in the eighteenth century . This dam has allowed the development of salt marsh s, creating a towpath and a channel to access the port. Along the channel is the graveyard of ships. On the other side of the pier, in the marshes is a noted bird habitat with waterfowl such as brant and little egret. At the end of the pier there are facilities for cycling and pedestrians.
* La chapelle de la Pitié : Meaning &quot;The Chapel of Mercy&quot;: There is a stele in memory of Jacobsen, creator of the dam, and the events of 3 January 1794 are recalled, when the island was attacked by the Republican troops, who killed 1500 Vendée prisoners, despite promising to pardon them.
* L&#x27;Hôtel Jacobsen : The Jacobsen Hotel is the largest building of Noirmoutier. It was built between 1761 and 1766 by Cornils Guislain-Jacobsen who had been in the town since 1740.

It was the headquarters of the customs administration in the nineteenth century, and tourist hotel called the Hotel d&#x27;Elba, after Napoleon&#x27;s expulsion to Elba.

<text>Nydia Caro (born June 7, 1948) is a Puerto Rican-American singer and actress.

==Early years==
Caro was born in New York City to parents from Rincón, Puerto Rico, and initiated her career in the arts at a very young age while living in New York. She attended James Monroe H.S. where she graduated in 1964. After completing high school, she enrolled in the New York School of Performing Arts in singing, dancing, and acting classes.

==Music and acting career==
Caro made her debut in show business acting at an NBC television show, and in 1964, released a Christmas-themed single on the Roulette Records label, &quot;Ask Me What I Want for Christmas&quot;. In 1967, shortly after her father died, she moved to Puerto Rico and released her first album titled &quot;&quot;. She has released 20 internationally acclaimed albums and CDs ever since. Caro enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico in literature to enhance her Spanish skills. She was hired immediately to co-host a popular teen show by channel 2 (&quot;Show Coca-Cola&quot;).

The decade of the 1970s was very successful for Caro. In 1970, she won the in Ibagué, Colombia, with the songs &quot;, composed by Karmen Mercado, the niece of actor and astrologer Walter Mercado, and &quot; composed by Raoul Gonzalez.

In 1972, she went to Tokyo, Japan, where she sang &quot; before the world heavyweight boxing championship fight between George Foreman and José Roman. &quot; remarked that her singing of the Puerto Rican national anthem probably lasted longer than the fight itself. That same year, she made an appearance on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; with fellow Puerto Rican entertainers Raúl Juliá and Sonia Manzano.

In 1973, she won one of the first awards in the in Valencia, Spain, with the song &quot;&quot;, composed by Julio Iglesias for her.

In 1974, she won the third edition of the OTI Festival representing Puerto Rico in the OTI Festival with a song named &quot;Cantar&quot;. The song, composed by Caro and Riccardo Cerratto, caused some controversy in Puerto Rico for being the &quot;anti-protest&quot; song in that decade. Despite that, the song helped Caro further extend her popularity built on prior hit songs such as &quot;, &quot;, &quot;Charly&quot;, &quot; and &quot;.

She released her self titled album in 1978 to critical acclaim, with Cash Box writing &quot;she stands out in every song. Arrangements by E. Leiva and R. Arusa are superb. The best cuts are &quot;Un Pueblo Es&quot;, &quot;A Quien Vas Enganar&quot;, &quot;Precisamente Tu&quot;, &quot;Oye Guitara Mia&quot;and &quot;Sugar Me&quot;. Should go high on the Latin American charts&quot; which it subsequently did.

She also hosted her own television program, &quot;, on Puerto Rican television. Moreover, her reputation was helped by strong concert performances in prestigious venues; such as, Club Caribe and Club Tropicoro in San Juan, Carnegie Hall, the Lincoln Center in New York and many others around the world in countries throughout South America, Spain, Australia, Mexico, and Japan. Besides Puerto Rico, Caro&#x27;s relevance as a cultural icon is strongest in Chile, a country in which she has performed regularly since her 1974 appearance at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival. She has appeared in Chilean telenovelas and has spent regular seasons living in the country.

In 1998, Caro released her album &quot; to critical acclaim. The album was produced by the Chilean producer Joakin Bello. It features musical themes such as the song &quot;&quot;, from the poems of Saint Teresa of Jesus, Luis de León and John of the Cross. It blends musical instruments native to distant countries; such as, Tibet and India, together with instruments from Puerto Rico and South America. The effort sets her apart from other artists in Puerto Rico, as the first exponent of &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;new age&quot; music, and was named as one of the 20 best recordings in 1999 by the National Foundation for Popular Culture in Puerto Rico.

==Image==
Caro has a reputation for her lasting beauty, her complexion has very few expression lines and gives the public the impression of her not aging with time (Caro became a grandmother in 2004). She claims she has had no plastic surgery and affirms her lasting youthful appearance is a result of minimizing exposure to sun as much as possible. At one time, she was the spokesperson for Oil of Olay products in Puerto Rico.

Caro also has a reputation for being &quot;classy&quot;, or elegantly sophisticated. She parodied this image by appearing in an advertisement campaign run by the Banco Popular, where she reportedly sells her house to Puerto Rican rapper Tego Calderón, the contrast in their public images played upon for comic effect. Another Puerto Rican rapper, Residente from Calle 13, remarks about Caro&#x27;s lasting sex appeal on the band&#x27;s song &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Age of -Copycat- Copying&quot;).

==Film==
In 2000, she made her Hollywood debut, playing Isabelle in &quot;Under Suspicion&quot;, starring Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman.

==Personal life==
Caro married Spanish producer Gabriel Suau and they had two children, Christian (currently a film director) and Gabriela. The couple divorced after a few years of marriage, but remain on good terms. During her marriage, she continued her professional singing career, releasing over 20 albums to date.

In 2019, Caro officiated the wedding of two homosexual close friends of hers and said it was one of the most meaningful things she&#x27;s ever done.

<text>Toketee Falls is a waterfall in Douglas County, Oregon, United States, on the North Umpqua River at its confluence with the Clearwater River. It is located approximately east of Roseburg near Oregon Route 138. 
&quot;Toketee&quot; (pronounced TOKE-uh-tee), is a Chinook Jargon word meaning &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;graceful&quot;. The falls was officially named by a United States Board on Geographic Names decision in 1916, over alternate names Ireland Falls and Toketie Falls.

==Description==
Carved from ancient columnar basalt, Toketee Falls drops approximately in two stages.

With a reliable water flow on the North Umpqua River, the falls avoids the seasonal fluctuations of other creek-fed waterfalls in Oregon. 

==Hydropower plant==
The waterfall is regulated by a dam built just upstream by PacifiCorp, which now regulates and reduces the water flow over the falls. The damming forms a reservoir called Toketee Lake. Previously the full volume of the North Umpqua River was allowed to flow over the falls, but the flow has been reduced by a penstock that utilizes the drop of the falls to generate hydroelectricity.

==Post office==
There was a Toketee Falls, Oregon post office from 1952 to 1956 during the construction of the PacifiCorp hydroelectric plant.

<doc id="871817" wikidata="Q2396434" url="?curid=871817" title="OpenMAX">
<text>OpenMAX (Open Media Acceleration), often shortened as &quot;OMX&quot;, is a non-proprietary and royalty-free cross-platform set of C-language programming interfaces. It provides abstractions for routines that are especially useful for processing of audio, video, and still images. It is intended for low power and embedded system devices (including smartphones, game consoles, digital media players, and set-top boxes) that need to efficiently process large amounts of multimedia data in predictable ways, such as video codecs, graphics libraries, and other functions for video, image, audio, voice and speech.

OpenMAX provides three layers of interfaces: application layer (AL), integration layer (IL) and development layer (DL). OpenMAX is managed by the non-profit technology consortium Khronos Group.

==History==
Initially announced in July 2004. The OpenMAX Working Group was initially founded by members ARM, Motorola, Samsung, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments. Version 1.0 of the specification was published in December 2005. The last draft produced by the OpenMAX Working Group (1.2.0) dates from 2011 and no product has been declared as conformant since 2012. The OpenMAX specification were never updated to support recent codecs like HEVC or VP9, making Android the de facto source of updates to the OpenMAX IL standard.

==Layers==
OpenMAX AL is the interface between multimedia applications, such as a media player, and the platform media framework. It allows companies that develop applications to easily migrate their applications to different platforms (customers) that support the OpenMAX AL application programming interface (API).

OpenMAX IL is the interface between media framework, (such as StageFright or MediaCodec API on Android, DirectShow on Windows, FFmpeg or GStreamer on Linux), and a set of multimedia components (such as an audio or video codecs). It allows companies that build platforms (e.g. allowing an implementation of an MP3 player) to easily change components like MP3 decoders and Equalizer effects and buy components for their platform from different vendors.

OpenMAX DL is the interface between physical hardware, such as digital signal processor (DSP) chips, CPUs, GPUs, and software, like video codecs and 3D engines. It allows companies to easily integrate new hardware that supports OpenMAX DL without reoptimizing their low level software.

==Application layer==

OpenMAX AL accommodates common multimedia application use cases by standardizing a set of representative objects, as well as interfaces on those objects, to control and configure them. The OpenMAX AL API is divided into two profiles: Media Player and Media Player/Recorder. A platform can be compliant to one or both of these profiles by providing all features included in a profile.

It is an application-level, C-language, multimedia API designed for resource-constrained devices. The OpenMAX AL API design puts particular emphasis on ensuring the API is suitable for mobile embedded devices - including basic mobile phones, smart “feature” phones, PDAs and mobile digital music players. Nevertheless, this does not preclude its applicability to other sophisticated media playback and recording devices.

The OpenMAX AL API design devotes particular attention to application-developer friendliness. Its status as an open cross-platform API enables developers to port the same source across multiple devices with minimal effort. Thus OpenMAX AL provides a stable base for application development.

===Features===
OpenMAX AL features include:
*Video playback and recording
*Audio playback and recording
*Image capture (camera) and display
*Camera controls
*Radio and RDS
*Basic MIDI playback
*Metadata extraction and insertion

====Digital TV extension====
A digital television (DTV) extension specification of OpenMAX AL adds standards-agnostic mobile TV tuning, playback, recording and electronic program guide functionality to OpenMAX AL Multimedia API, as a modular royalty-free, cross-platform C-language API for high-performance digital TV-related applications on mobile and embedded devices. DTV Extension is compatible with all major mobile TV standards (e.g. DVB-H, ISDB-T, T-DMB, etc.), and supports broadcast, unicast and multicast delivery methods for Digital TV.

===Specification versions===
* OpenMAX AL 1.0 Provisional Specification - a provisional version, dated 2007-09-02, to facilitate feedback from the community before the final 1.0 release.
* OpenMAX AL 1.0 Specification - dated 2009-06-23
* OpenMAX AL 1.0.1 Specification - dated 2010-03-12
* OpenMAX AL 1.1 Specification - dated 2011-01-18

=== Implementations===
* Android 4.0 and later exposes OpenMAX AL as part of its NDK (Native Development Kit).
* LIM OpenMAX is an open source implementation of OpenMAX AL and OpenMAX IL for Linux.

===Comparison with OpenSL ES===
OpenSL ES (Open Sound Library for Embedded Systems) is another Khronos Group API that also provides an audio library for the same target market as OpenMAX AL, while OpenMAX target the complete multimedia services. OpenSL ES and OpenMAX AL audio subset share the same common architecture and have a few common features:
* Audio playback and recording
* Basic MIDI playback
* Metadata extraction

==Integration layer==

The OpenMAX IL API strives to give media components portability across an array of platforms using the C-language. In the OpenMAX IL, components represent individual blocks of functionality. Components can be sources, sinks, codecs, filters, splitters, mixers, or any other data operator. Depending on the implementation, a component could possibly represent a piece of hardware, a software codec, another processor, or a combination thereof.

The interface abstracts the hardware and software architecture in the system. The OpenMAX IL API allows the user to load, control, connect, and unload the individual components. This flexible core architecture allows the Integration Layer to easily implement almost any media use case and mesh with existing graph-based media frameworks. The key focus of the OpenMAX IL API is portability of media components.

The OpenMAX IL API design devotes particular attention to use case flexibility and optimized data transfers between components.

The OpenMAX IL API was chosen as the base for the API to integrate Audio and Video codecs on Android, which has resulted in most SoC vendors shipping a minimal implementation that only supports the subset required by Android. Applications do not use those OpenMAX IL components directly, but only through the Android MediaCodec API. Android&#x27;s subset of OpenMAX IL with its extensions is now the de facto standard.

In 2011 the provisional version 1.2.0 was released.

=== Implementations===
* Tizonia is an open source OpenMAX IL implementation for Linux that supports version 1.2.0.
* Bellagio is an open source OpenMAX IL implementation for Linux maintained by STMicroelectronics.
* LIM OpenMAX is an open source implementation of OpenMAX AL and OpenMAX IL for Linux.
* Mesa provides hardware accelerated drivers that can be used with Bellagio or Tizonia.
* Android StageFright, a partial implementation of IL that is the de facto standard.

==Development layer==

The OpenMAX DL API defines a set of low-level multimedia kernels or media processing building blocks. The building blocks might be used to accelerate traditional computational hotspots within standardized media codecs and other integrated media processing engines. The functional scope of the OpenMAX DL interface spans several domains including signal processing and image processing, audio coding, image coding, and video coding.

OpenMAX DL is split into five application domains:
* AC - Audio Codecs (MP3 decoder and AAC decoder components)
* IC - Image Codecs (JPEG components)
* IP - Image Processing (Generic image processing functions)
* SP - Signal Processing (Generic audio processing functions)
* VC - Video Codecs (H.264 and MP4 components)

=== Implementations===
* Optimized implementations for NEON (for Cortex A8 cores) and SIMD (for ARM11 cores), as well as an ANSI C reference implementation, were previously available from ARM for registered users.
* The OpenMAX API is supported by the PlayStation 3 console.

==Working group==
The OpenMAX working group was founded alongside sister project OpenVG on July 6, 2004. Promoting members in 2008 were AMD, Apple, ARM, Creative, Dell Inc, Ericsson, Freescale, Imagination Technologies Group plc, Intel, IBM, Motorola, Nokia, Nvidia Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, SK Telecom, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc and Texas Instruments.

<doc id="871818" wikidata="Q1070832" url="?curid=871818" title="George Forrest (author)">
<text>George Forrest (born George Forrest Chichester Jr., July 31, 1915 – October 10, 1999) was an American writer of music and lyrics for musical theatre best known for the show &quot;Kismet&quot;, adapted from the works of Alexander Borodin. He was also known professionally at times as Chet Forrest.

==Biography==
Throughout his career Forrest worked exclusively with the composer-lyricist Robert Wright. The two men had an affinity for adapting classical music themes and adding lyrics to these themes for the Broadway musical stage and films. Wright said that the music was usually a 50-50 &quot;collaboration&quot; between Wright and Forrest and the composer. While both men were credited equally as composer-lyricists, it was Mr. Forrest who worked with the music.

&quot;&quot;Kismet&quot;&quot; was one of several works Forrest created with Wright commissioned by impresario Edwin Lester for the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera (LACLO). &quot;Song of Norway&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Lady&quot;, &quot;Magdalena&quot;, and their adaptation of &quot;The Great Waltz&quot; were also commissioned by Lester for the LACLO. The LACLO then exported most of these productions to Broadway. Forrest and Wright won a Tony Award for their work on &quot;Kismet&quot;. In 1995, they were awarded the ASCAP Foundation Richard Rodgers Award.

Forrest was cremated at Van Orsdel (Northside Chapel) Crematory, Miami.

<text>Robert Craig Wright (September 25, 1914 – July 27, 2005) was an American composer-lyricist for Hollywood and the musical theatre, best known for the Broadway musical and musical film &quot;Kismet&quot;, for which he and his professional partner George Forrest adapted themes by Alexander Borodin and added lyrics. &quot;Kismet&quot; was one of several Wright and Forrest creations that was commissioned by impresario Edwin Lester for the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. &quot;Song of Norway&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Lady&quot;, &quot;Magdalena&quot;, and their adaptation of &quot;The Great Waltz&quot; were also commissioned by Lester for the LACLO. The LACLO passed most of these productions to Broadway.

Wright was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States. Wright and Forrest had an affinity for adapting classical music themes and adding lyrics to these themes for Hollywood and the Broadway musical stage. Wright said that the music was usually a &quot;collaboration&quot; between Wright and Forrest and the composer. While both men were credited equally as composer-lyricists, it was Forrest who worked with the music. Forrest and Wright won a Tony Award for their work on &quot;Kismet&quot; and, in 1995, they were awarded the ASCAP Foundation Richard Rodgers Award.

He was cremated at Cofer-Kolski-Combs mortuary, Miami, and his ashes given to his executor.

<doc id="871820" wikidata="Q263123" url="?curid=871820" title="Annie Chapman">
<text>Annie Chapman (born Eliza Ann Smith; 25 September 1840 – 8 September 1888) was the second canonical victim of the notorious unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper, who killed and mutilated a minimum of five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London from late August to early November 1888.

Although previous murders linked to Jack the Ripper (then known as the &quot;Whitechapel murderer&quot;) had received considerable press and public attention, the murder of Annie Chapman generated a state of panic in the East End of London, with police under increasing pressure to apprehend the culprit.

==Early life==
Annie Chapman was born Eliza Ann Smith in Paddington on 25 September 1840. She was the first of five children born to George Smith, and Ruth Chapman. George Smith was a soldier, having enlisted in the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards in December 1834. Reportedly, the location of Chapman&#x27;s earliest years revolved around her father&#x27;s military service in London and Windsor.

Chapman&#x27;s parents were not married at the time of her birth, although they married on 22 February 1842, in Paddington. Following the birth of their second child in 1844, the family relocated to Knightsbridge, where George Smith became a valet. The family eventually relocated to Berkshire in 1856.

According to her brother, Fountain, Annie had &quot;first took a drink when she was quite young&quot;, quickly developing a weakness for alcohol, and although both he and two of his other sisters had persuaded her to sign a pledge to refrain from consuming alcohol, she &quot;was tempted and fell&quot; despite the &quot;over and over&quot; efforts of her siblings to dissuade her.

===Family relocation===
Census records from 1861 indicate all members of the Smith family—except Annie—had relocated to the parish of Clewer. Chapman is believed to have remained in London, possibly due to her employment commitments as a domestic servant. Her father, George Smith (also known as William Smith), was the valet to Captain Thomas Naylor Leland of the Denbighshire Yeomanry Cavalry. On 13 June 1863, Smith accompanied his employer to a horse racing event. He lodged with his employer that evening at the Elephant and Castle, Wrexham. That night, George Smith committed suicide by cutting his throat.

Contemporary accounts describe Annie Chapman as an intelligent and sociable woman with a weakness for alcohol—particularly rum. An acquaintance described Chapman at the inquest into her murder as being &quot;very civil and industrious when sober&quot;, before noting: &quot;I have often seen her the worse for drink.&quot; She was in height and had blue eyes and wavy, dark brown hair, leading acquaintances to give her the nickname &quot;Dark Annie&quot;.

==Marriage==

On 1 May 1869, Annie married John James Chapman, who was related to her mother. The ceremony was conducted at All Saints Church in the Knightsbridge district of London, and was witnessed by one of her sisters, Emily Laticia, and a colleague of her husband named George White. The Chapmans&#x27; residence on their marriage certificate is listed as 29 Montpelier Place, Brompton, although the couple are believed to have briefly resided with White and his wife in Bayswater.

In the years following their marriage, the Chapmans lived at various West London addresses. In the early 1870s, John Chapman obtained employment in the service of a nobleman in Bond Street.

===Children===
The couple had three children: Emily Ruth (b. 25 June 1870); Annie Georgina (b. 5 June 1873); and John Alfred (b. 21 November 1880). Emily Ruth was born at Chapman&#x27;s mother&#x27;s home in Montpelier Place, Knightsbridge; Annie Georgina was born at South Bruton Mews, Mayfair; and John Alfred was born in the Berkshire village of Bray. John was born crippled. The Chapmans sought medical help for their son John at a London hospital before later placing him in the care of an institution for the physically disabled close to Windsor.

Although Chapman had struggled with alcoholism as an adult, she had reportedly weaned herself off drink by 1880. Her son&#x27;s disability is believed to have contributed to her gradual reversion to alcohol dependency.

In 1881, the Chapman family relocated from West London to Windsor, where John Chapman took a job as a coachman to a farm bailiff named Josiah Weeks, and the Chapman family living in the attic rooms of St. Leonard Hill Farm Cottage. The following year, Emily Ruth Chapman died of meningitis on her brother&#x27;s second birthday at the age of 12.

Following the death of their daughter, both Chapman and her husband took to heavy drinking. Over the following years, she is known to have been arrested on several occasions for public intoxication in both Clewer and Windsor, though no records exist of her ever being brought before a magistrates court for these arrests.

==Separation==
Chapman and her husband separated by mutual consent in 1884. John Chapman retained custody of their surviving daughter, while Annie relocated to London. Her husband was obliged to pay her a weekly allowance of 10 shillings via Post Office Order. The precise reason for the couple&#x27;s separation is unknown, although a later police report lists the reason for their separation as Annie Chapman&#x27;s &quot;drunken and immoral ways&quot;.

Two years later, in 1886, John Chapman resigned from his job due to his declining health and relocated to New Windsor. He died of liver cirrhosis and edema, on 25 December, leading to the cessation of these weekly payments. Chapman learned of her husband&#x27;s death through her brother-in-law. Her surviving daughter, Annie Georgina (then aged 13), is believed to have either subsequently been placed in a French institution or to have joined a performing troupe which travelled with a circus in France. Census records from 1891 reveal both of Chapman&#x27;s surviving children lived with their grandmother in Knightsbridge.

===Life in Whitechapel===
Following her separation from her husband, Annie Chapman relocated to Whitechapel, primarily living upon the weekly allowance of 10s from her husband. Over the following years, she resided in common lodging-houses in both Whitechapel and Spitalfields. By 1886, she is known to have resided with a man who made wire sieves for a living, consequently becoming known to some acquaintances as &quot;Annie Sievey&quot; or &quot;Siffey&quot;. At the end of 1886, her weekly allowance abruptly stopped. Upon enquiring why these weekly payments had suddenly ceased, Chapman discovered her husband had died of alcohol-related causes.

Shortly after John Chapman&#x27;s death, this sieve-maker left Chapman—possibly due to the cessation of her allowance—and relocated to Notting Hill. One of Chapman&#x27;s friends said she became depressed after this separation and seemed to lose her will to live.

==1888==
By May or June 1888, Chapman resided in Crossingham&#x27;s Lodging House at 35 Dorset Street, paying 8d a night for a double bed. According to the lodging-house deputy, Timothy Donovan, a 47-year-old bricklayer&#x27;s labourer named Edward &quot;The Pensioner&quot; Stanley would typically stay with Chapman at the lodging house between Saturday and Monday, occasionally paying for her bed. She earned some income from crochet work, making antimacassars, and working as a flower seller, supplemented by casual prostitution.

Eight days prior to Chapman&#x27;s death, she had fought with a fellow Crossingham&#x27;s Lodging House resident named Eliza Cooper. The two were reportedly rivals for the affections of a local hawker named Harry, although Cooper later claimed the reason the two had fought had been because Chapman had borrowed a bar of soap from her, and after being asked to return it, Chapman had simply thrown a halfpenny upon a kitchen table, saying, &quot;Go get a halfpenny&#x27;s worth of soap.&quot; Later, in a fight between the two at the Britannia Public House, Cooper struck Chapman in the face and chest, resulting in her sustaining a black eye and bruised breast.

On 7 September, Amelia Palmer encountered Annie Chapman in Dorset Street. Palmer later informed police Chapman had appeared visibly pale on this occasion, having been discharged from the casual ward of the Whitechapel Infirmary that day. Chapman complained to Palmer of having felt &quot;too ill to do anything&quot;.

After Chapman&#x27;s death, the coroner who conducted her autopsy noted her lungs and brain membranes were in an advanced state of disease which would have killed her within months.

===8 September===
According to both the lodging-house deputy, Timothy Donovan, and the watchman, John Evans, shortly after midnight on 8 September, Chapman had been lacking the required money for her nightly lodging. She drank a pint of beer in the kitchen with fellow lodger Frederick Stevens at approximately 12:10 a.m. before informing another lodger that she had earlier visited her sister in Vauxhall, and that her family had given her 5d. Stevens then observed Chapman take a box of pills from her pocket. This box then broke, whereupon Chapman wrapped the pills in a section of envelope she had taken from a mantlepiece before leaving the property. At approximately 1:35 a.m., Chapman returned to the lodging-house with a baked potato which she ate before again leaving the premises with a likely intention of earning the money to pay for a bed via prostituting herself, stating: &quot;I won&#x27;t be long, Brummie. See that Tim keeps the bed for me.&quot; Evans last saw Chapman walking in the direction of Spitalfields Market.

A Mrs Elizabeth Long testified at the subsequent inquest into Chapman&#x27;s murder that she had observed Chapman talking with a man at 5:30 a.m. The two had stood just beyond the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Long described this man as being over 40 years old, slightly taller than Chapman, with dark hair, and of a foreign, &quot;shabby-genteel&quot; appearance. He was wearing a brown low-crowned felt hat and possibly a dark coat. According to Long, the man had asked Chapman the question, &quot;Will you?&quot; to which Chapman replied, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Long was certain as to Chapman&#x27;s identity and the time of this sighting, as she had heard the chiming of a nearby clock strike the half-hour just before she had entered Hanbury Street. If she had indeed seen Chapman, she was likely the last person to see her alive, and in the company of her murderer.

==Murder==
Shortly before 5:00 a.m. on 8 September, the son of a resident of 29 Hanbury Street, John Richardson, entered the back yard of the property to check the padlocked cellar in the yard was still intact and to trim a loose piece of leather from his boot. Richardson verified the cellar was still padlocked, then sat on the rear steps of the property to trim the loose leather from his boot, noting nothing untoward. He then exited the property via the front door approximately three minutes later, having not proceeded beyond the steps to the back yard.

At approximately 5:15 a.m., a tenant of 27 Hanbury Street named Albert Cadosch entered the yard of the property to use the lavatory. Cadosch later informed police he had heard a woman say, &quot;No, no!&quot; before hearing the sound of something or someone falling against the fence dividing the back yards of numbers 27 and 29 Hanbury Street. He did not investigate these sounds.


Annie Chapman&#x27;s mutilated body was discovered shortly before 6:00 a.m. by an elderly resident of 29 Hanbury Street named John Davis. Davis noticed that the front door was now open, while the back door was shut. Her body was lying on the ground near the doorway to the back yard, with her head six inches (15 cm) from the steps to the property. Davis alerted three men named James Green, James Kent, and Henry Holland to his discovery, before all three ran down Commercial Street to find a policeman as Davis reported his discovery at the nearest police station.

At the corner of Hanbury Street, Green, Kent, and Holland found Divisional Inspector Joseph Luniss Chandler and told him, &quot;Another woman has been murdered!&quot; Chandler followed the men to Chapman&#x27;s body before requesting the assistance of police surgeon Dr George Bagster Phillips and more officers. Several policemen arrived within minutes. They were instructed to clear the passageway to the yard to ensure Dr Phillips had access. Phillips arrived at Hanbury Street at approximately 6:30 a.m.

Dr Phillips was quickly able to establish a definite link between Chapman&#x27;s murder and the murder of Mary Ann Nichols, which had occurred on 31 August. Nichols had also suffered two deep slash wounds to the throat, inflicted from the left to the right of her neck, before her murderer had mutilated her abdomen, and a blade of similar size and design had been used in both murders. Phillips also observed six areas of blood spattering upon the wall of the house between the steps and wooden palings dividing 27 and 29 Hanbury Street. Some of these spatterings were 18 inches (45 cm) above the ground.

Two pills, which Chapman had been prescribed for a lung condition, a section of a torn envelope, a small piece of frayed coarse muslin, and a comb were recovered close to her body. A leather apron, partially submerged in a dish of water located close to a tap, was also discovered close to her body.

Contemporary press reports also claim that two farthings were also found in the yard of Hanbury Street close to Chapman&#x27;s body, although no reference is made to these coins in any surviving contemporary police records. The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police Service, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, was reported as mentioning these coins at an inquest in 1889, and the acting Commissioner of the City Police, Major Henry Smith, also referenced these coins in his memoirs. Smith&#x27;s memoirs, written more than twenty years after the Whitechapel murders, are generally considered to be both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect.

==Inquest==
The official inquest into Chapman&#x27;s death was opened at the Working Lad&#x27;s Institute, Whitechapel, on 10 September. This inquest was presided over by the Middlesex coroner, Wynne Edwin Baxter. The first day of the inquest heard testimony from four witnesses, including John Davies, who testified to his discovery of Chapman&#x27;s body. Davies testified he had lived at Hanbury Street for two weeks and had never seen the door to the yard of the property locked. He added that any individual who knew where the latch to the front door of the property was could open it to facilitate access to the backyard. Also to testify were Timothy Donovan and John Evans, both of whom testified they had positively identified the body of the deceased as Annie Chapman. Donovan also testified he had last seen Chapman alive at approximately 1:50 a.m. on 8 September, and the last words she had spoken to him were: &quot;I have not sufficient money for my bed. Don&#x27;t let it. I shan&#x27;t be long before I am in.&quot;

===Character testimony===
Fellow Crossingham&#x27;s Lodging House resident Amelia Palmer also testified on the first day of the inquest that she had known Chapman for several years, and had been in the habit of writing letters for her. Palmer testified that although Chapman had a fondness for alcohol, she considered her a respectable woman who never used profane language. She also testified Chapman had &quot;not as a regular means of livelihood&quot; been in the habit of selling sexual favours for money, adding she most often earned her income by performing crochet work or purchasing matches and flowers to sell for a small profit and had only begun resorting to prostitution following the death of her husband in December 1886. Every Friday, Chapman would travel to Stratford to &quot;sell anything she had&quot;. The lodging-house deputy, Timothy Donovan, testified Chapman had always been on good terms with other lodgers, with the quarrel and resulting fisticuffs between herself and Eliza Cooper on 31 August being the only incident of trouble at the premises involving her. Donovan also testified that although Chapman would typically drink to excess on Saturday nights, she was most often sober for the remainder of the week.

===Medical testimony===
The third day of the inquest saw testimony from police called to the crime scene and the subsequent post-mortem. This medical testimony indicated that Chapman may have been murdered as late as 5:30 a.m. in the yard of Hanbury Street. Previous testimony from several tenants of 29 Hanbury Street had revealed none had seen or heard anything suspicious at the time of Chapman&#x27;s murder, with John Richardson testifying on the second day of the inquest that the passageway through the house to the back-yard was not locked, as it was frequented by residents at all hours of the day, and that the front door had been wide open at the time Chapman&#x27;s body was discovered. Richardson also testified he had often seen strangers, both men and women, loitering in the passageway of the house.

On 13 September, Dr George Bagster Phillips described the body as he observed it at 6:30 a.m. in the back yard of the house at 29 Hanbury Street:
Chapman&#x27;s throat had been cut from left to right so deeply the bones of her vertebral column bore striations, and she had been disembowelled, with a section of the flesh from her stomach being placed upon her left shoulder and another section of skin and flesh—plus her small intestines—being removed and placed above her right shoulder. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus and bladder was missing. Chapman&#x27;s protruding tongue and swollen face led Dr Phillips to believe that she may have been asphyxiated with the handkerchief around her neck before her throat was cut, and that her murderer had held her chin as he performed this act. As there was no blood trail leading to the yard, he was certain that she was killed where she was found.

Phillips concluded that Chapman suffered from a long-standing lung disease, that she was sober at the time of her death, and that she had not consumed alcoholic beverages for at least some hours before death. He was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out her reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As her body was not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organ was removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could then sell as surgical specimens. In his summing up, Coroner Baxter raised the possibility that Chapman was murdered deliberately to obtain the uterus, on the basis that an American had made enquiries at a London medical school for the purchase of such organs. &quot;The Lancet&quot; rejected Baxter&#x27;s suggestion, scathingly pointing out &quot;certain improbabilities and absurdities&quot;, and saying it was &quot;a grave error of judgement&quot;. The &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; was similarly dismissive, and reported that the physician who requested the samples was a highly reputable doctor, unnamed, who had left the country 18 months before the murder. Baxter dropped the theory and never referred to it again. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; claimed the American doctor was from Philadelphia, and author Philip Sugden later speculated that the man in question was the notorious Francis Tumblety.

Discussing Chapman&#x27;s time of death, Dr Phillips estimated that she had died either at or before 4:30 a.m., contradicting the inquest eyewitnesses Richardson, Long and Cadosch, all of whom indicated Chapman&#x27;s murder had occurred after this time. However, Victorian methods of estimating the time of death of an individual, such as measuring body temperature, were crude by modern methodology. Phillips himself highlighted at the inquest that Chapman&#x27;s body temperature could have cooled more quickly than normally expected.

==Conclusion==
The inquest into Chapman&#x27;s murder lasted five days, with the final day of hearings being adjourned until 26 September. No further witnesses testified on this date, although coroner Baxter informed the jury: &quot;I have no doubt that if the perpetrator of this foul murder is eventually discovered, our efforts will not have been useless.&quot;

Following a short deliberation, the jury, having been instructed to consider precisely how, when, and by what means Chapman came about her death, returned a verdict of wilful murder against a person or persons unknown.

==Investigation==
On 15 September, Chief Inspector Donald Swanson of Scotland Yard was placed in overall command of the investigation into Chapman&#x27;s murder. Swanson later reported that an &quot;immediate and searching enquiry was made at all common lodging-houses to ascertain if anyone had entered [their premises] on the morning with blood on his hands or clothes, or under any suspicious circumstances&quot;.

===Leather Apron===

A leather apron belonging to John Richardson lay under a tap in the yard of 29 Hanbury Street. This apron had been placed there by his mother, who had washed it on 6 September. Richardson was investigated thoroughly by the police, but was eliminated from the enquiry. Nonetheless, press reports of the discovery of this apron fuelled local rumours which had first been published in &quot;The Star&quot; on 4 September following the murder of Mary Ann Nichols that a Jew from the district known as &quot;Leather Apron&quot; was responsible for the Whitechapel murders.

Journalists, frustrated by the general unwillingness of the Criminal Investigation Department to reveal many details of their investigation to the public, and eager to capitalise on the increasing public unrest regarding the Whitechapel murders, frequently resorted to writing reports of questionable veracity. Imaginative descriptions of &quot;Leather Apron&quot;, using crude Jewish stereotypes, appeared in the press. The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; reported that: &quot;Whatever information may be in the possession of the police they deem it necessary to keep secret ... It is believed their attention is particularly directed to ... a notorious character known as &#x27;Leather Apron&#x27;.&quot; Rival journalists dismissed these accounts as &quot;a mythical outgrowth of the reporter&#x27;s fancy&quot;.

John Pizer, a 38-year-old Polish Jew who made footwear from leather, was known by the name &quot;Leather Apron&quot;. Via knifepoint, Pizer frequently intimidated local prostitutes. He appeared before the Thames Magistrates&#x27; Court on 4 August 1888, charged with indecent assault. Pizer is also believed to have stabbed a man in the hand in 1887.

Despite there being no direct evidence against Pizer, he was arrested by a Sergeant William Thicke on 10 September. Although Pizer claimed to the contrary, Thicke knew of Pizer&#x27;s local reputation, and his &quot;Leather Apron&quot; nick-name.

Pizer was released from custody on 11 September after police were able to verify his alibis on the nights of the murders of both Chapman and Nichols. He was called as a witness on the second day of the inquest into Chapman&#x27;s murder to publicly clear his name, and demolish the public suspicions that he was the killer. Pizer also successfully obtained monetary compensation from at least one newspaper that had published several articles naming him as the prime suspect in the Whitechapel murders.

===Pawnbrokers===
Two brass rings—one flat; one oval—Chapman is known to have worn were not recovered at the crime scene, either because she had pawned them or because they had been stolen, possibly by her murderer. Theorising her murderer had removed these items of jewellery in order to pawn them, police unsuccessfully searched all the pawnbrokers in Spitalfields and Whitechapel.

===Edward Stanley===
The section of a torn envelope recovered close to Chapman&#x27;s body, bearing the crest of the Royal Sussex Regiment and postmarked &#x27;London, 28 August 1888&#x27;, was briefly believed could be traced to Edward Stanley, thus placing him at the scene of Chapman&#x27;s murder. Stanley was soon eliminated as a suspect as his alibis for the nights of the murders of both Nichols and Chapman were quickly confirmed. Between 6 August and 1 September, he was known to have been on active duty with the Hampshire Militia in Gosport, and on the night of Chapman&#x27;s murder, eyewitnesses confirmed Stanley had been at his lodgings.

===Further enquiries and arrests===
In addition to John Pizer and Edward Stanley, police investigated and/or detained several other individuals in their investigation into Chapman&#x27;s murder, all of whom were released from custody. On 9 September, a 53-year-old ship&#x27;s cook named William Henry Piggott was detained after arriving at a Gravesend pub with a recent hand injury and shouting misogynistic remarks. A blood-stained shirt he had left in a local fish shop was quickly traced to Piggott, who claimed that he had been bitten by a woman and that the blood on the shirt was his own. He was investigated, but soon released from custody.

A Swiss butcher, Jacob Isenschmid, matched an eyewitness description of a blood-stained man seen acting suspiciously on the morning of Chapman&#x27;s murder by a public house landlady, a Mrs Fiddymont. Isenschmid&#x27;s distinctive appearance included a large ginger moustache, and he was known to have had a history of mental illness. He was arrested on suspicion of committing Chapman&#x27;s murder on 13 September.

On 18 September, a 40-year-old German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was arrested after he attempted to stab a young man named Alexander Finlay at a coffee stall while intoxicated. Ludwig was arrested very shortly after this incident in the company of a visibly distressed prostitute, who later informed a policeman: &quot;Dear me! He frightened me very much when he pulled a big knife out.&quot; Ludwig was also known to have been wanted by the City of London Police for attempting to slash a woman&#x27;s throat with a razor.

Isenschmid and Ludwig were both ultimately cleared of suspicion after two further murders were committed on the same date while both were in police custody. Isenschmid was later detained in a mental asylum. Other suspects named in contemporary police records and newspapers pertaining to the investigation into Chapman&#x27;s murder include a local trader named Friedrich Schumacher, pedlar Edward McKenna, apothecary and mental patient Oswald Puckridge, and insane medical student John Sanders. No evidence exists against any of these individuals.
==Media moniker==

On 27 September, the Central News Agency received the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter, written by an individual claiming to be the murderer. The author of this letter paid reference to the press naming him as &quot;Leather Apron&quot;, stating: &quot;That joke about Leather Apron gave me fits&quot;. The author concluded this letter with the words &quot;Yours truly, Jack the Ripper&quot;. This name quickly supplanted &quot;Leather Apron&quot; as the media&#x27;s favourite moniker for the murderer.

==Funeral==
Chapman&#x27;s body was moved from Hanbury Street to a mortuary in Montagu Street, Marylebone by Sergeant Edward Badham in a handcart large enough to hold one coffin. This was similar to the cart previously used to move the body of Mary Ann Nichols.

Chapman was buried shortly after 9:00 a.m. on 14 September 1888 in a service paid for by her family. She was laid to rest in a communal grave within Manor Park Cemetery, Forest Gate, east London. At the request of Chapman&#x27;s family, the funeral was not publicised, with no mourning coaches used throughout the service, and only the undertaker, police, and her relatives knowing of these arrangements. Consequently, relatives were the only people to attend the service.

A hearse supplied by Hanbury Street undertaker Henry Smith travelled to the Whitechapel Mortuary in Montague Street to collect Chapman&#x27;s body at 7:00 a.m. Her body was placed in an elm coffin draped in black and was then driven to Spitalfields undertaker Harry Hawes, who arranged the funeral. Chapman&#x27;s relatives met the hearse outside the cemetery. Her coffin plate bore the words &quot;Annie Chapman, died Sept. 8, 1888, aged 48 years.&quot;

The precise location of Annie Chapman&#x27;s grave within Manor Park Cemetery is now unknown. A plaque placed in the cemetery by authorities in 2008 reads: &quot;Her remains are buried within this area.&quot;.

<text>The General Motors A platform (commonly called A-body) was an automobile platform, and was GM&#x27;s original, and oldest, platform used by all early GM products, beginning with the Chevrolet Superior. From this platform, all North American platforms B, C, and D were developed.

Starting in 1926 through 1958, GM used four different designations based on different wheelbase dimensions used which helped Fisher Body standardize coachwork provided for various bodyshells/platforms with the A-body for Chevrolet, most Pontiacs, Buick, and Oldsmobile vehicles. The A-body was temporarily suspended in 1958 until it was reintroduced in 1964.

The A-body designation was resurrected in 1964 for a new series of intermediate-sized cars including the Chevrolet Chevelle, Pontiac Tempest, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Buick Skylark. These later A-bodies underwent a switch in drive layout from rear-wheel drive to front-wheel drive in 1982. The switch in the drive layout spawned the G-body.

* 1923–1958 and 1964–1981 GM A platform (RWD)
* 1982–1996 GM A platform (FWD)

<text>Shibu Soren (born 11 January 1944; ) is an Indian politician who is currently member of Rajya Sabha representing Jharkhand and the leader of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. He formerly served as 3rd Chief Minister of Jharkhand, first in 2005 for 10 days (2 March to 12 March), then from 2008 to 2009 and again from 2009 to 2010. He is also the President of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) political party, a constituent of the INDIA Alliance. He was the member of Lok Sabha from Dumka from 1980 to 1984, 1989 to 1998 and from 2002 to 2019 and Minister for Coal in the Union Cabinet from 2004 to 2004, 2004 to 2005 and from 2006 to 2006, when a Delhi district court found him guilty in the murder of his private secretary Shashi Nath Jha in 1994. He has also been indicted in the past on other criminal charges.

==Life==
Soren was born in Nemra village of Ramgarh district, in what was, at the time, Bihar state, India. He belongs to Santal tribe. He completed his schooling in the same district. During his schooling his father was murdered by thugs employed by money lenders.

At the age of 18, he formed the Santhal Navyuvak Sangh. 
In 1972, Bengali Maxist trade union leader A. K. Roy, Kurmi-Mahato leader Binod Bihari Mahato and Santal leader Shibu Soren formed Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Soren became the general secretary of JMM. JMM organised agitations to reclaim the tribal lands which were alienated. They started forcibly harvesting in the lands. Shibu Soren was known for delivering summary justice against landlords and money lenders, sometimes by holding own courts. On 23 January 1975, he allegedly incited a campaign to drive away &quot;outsiders&quot;, or the &#x27;non-tribal&#x27; people. At least eleven people were killed. Soren and numerous others were charged with various crimes related to this incident. After extended legal proceedings, Soren was acquitted on 6 March 2008. However, possibly related incitement charges—dating from two earlier deaths in 1974—remain pending.

He lost his first Lok Sabha election in 1977. He was first elected to the Lok Sabha in 1980 from Dumka. An arrest warrant was issued against him. He was subsequently elected to the Lok Sabha in 1989, 1991 and 1996 as well. In 2002, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in a by-election the same year and resigned his Rajya Sabha seat. He was re-elected in 2004.

He became the Union Coal Minister in the Manmohan Singh government, but was asked to resign following an arrest warrant in his name in the thirty-year-old Chirudih case. He was one of the main accused amongst 69, with allegations to kill 10 people (including 9 Muslims) on 23 January 1975, in a clash between tribals and Muslims. After the warrant was issued, he initially went underground. He resigned on 24 July 2004. He was able to secure bail after spending over a month in judicial custody; released on bail on 8 September, he was re-inducted into the Union Cabinet and given back the coal ministry on 27 November 2004, as part of a deal for a Congress-JMM alliance before assembly elections in Jharkhand in February/March 2005.

On 2 March 2005, after much political bargaining and quid pro quo he was invited to form the government in Jharkhand by the Governor of Jharkhand. He resigned as Chief Minister nine days later, on 11 March, following his failure to obtain a vote of confidence in the assembly. In 2019 Lok Sabha Elections he lost to Sunil Soren of BJP from Dumka constituency.

==Life imprisonment and acquittal==
On 28 November 2006, Soren was found guilty in a twelve-year-old case involving the kidnapping and murder of his former personal secretary Shashinath Jha. It was claimed that Jha was abducted from the Dhaula Kuan area in Delhi on 22 May 1994 and taken to Piska Nagari near Ranchi where he was killed. The CBI chargesheet stated that Jha&#x27;s knowledge of the reported deal between the Congress and the JMM to save the Narasimha Rao government during the July 1993 no-confidence motion and an act of sodomy was the motive behind the murder. The charge-sheet asserted that: &quot;Jha was aware of the illegal transactions and also expected and demanded a substantial share out of this amount from Soren.&quot;

Soren resigned from his post of Union Minister for Coal after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanded that he should do so in the wake of the verdict. This is the first case of a Union Minister of the Government of India being found guilty of involvement in a murder. On 5 December 2006, Shibu Soren was sentenced to life imprisonment. A Delhi court rejected his bail plea, stating: &#x27;We cannot overlook the fact that the appellant (Soren) has been convicted after a detailed and elaborate trial only in November 2006 and sentenced in December 2006.

The bench also noted that he was also being tried in a number of other cases, including the case of mass murder in Jharkhand.

On 25 June 2007, Shibu Soren was being escorted to his jail in Dumka, Jharkhand when his convoy was attacked by bombs, but no one was hurt.

The Delhi High Court on 23 August 2007 overruled the District Court and acquitted Soren, stating that &quot;The trial court&#x27;s analysis is far from convincing and not sustainable.&quot;

The five men convicted by the Tis Hazari court were held guilty of criminal conspiracy, abduction and murder primarily on the basis of forensic evidence provided by a post-mortem report of a body discovered in Jharkhand, namely a skull superimposition test and skull injury report. This was in addition to eyewitness accounts and some circumstantial evidence.

== Personal life ==

He is married to Roopi Kisku. He has three sons Durga Soren, Hemant Soren, and Basant Soren and a daughter, Anjali Soren. His son, Hemant Soren as the Chief Minister of Jharkhand He is currently CM previously from July 2013 to December 2014. His elder son Durga Soren was MLA from Jama from 1995 to 2005. Durga&#x27;s wife Sita Soren is former MLA from Jama, now in BJP. Basant Soren is president of the Jharkhand Yuva Morcha, a youth wing of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and current MLA from Dumka.

<text>The Douglas Y1B-7 was a 1930s American bomber aircraft. It was the first US monoplane given the &quot;B-&quot; &#x27;bomber&#x27; designation. The monoplane was more practical and less expensive than the biplane, and the United States Army Air Corps chose to experiment with monoplanes for this reason. At the time the XB-7 was ordered, it was being tested by Douglas Aircraft as an observational plane.

==Design and development==
In 1929–1930, the Douglas Aircraft Company designed a new twin-engined monoplane observation aircraft to compete with the Fokker XO-27, two prototypes of which had been ordered by the United States Army Air Corps in July 1929, as Douglas feared that the advanced Fokker would challenge Douglas&#x27;s role as the major supplier of observation aircraft to the Air Corps. The Douglas proposals resulted in the Air Corps placing an order for two prototypes, the XO-35 and XO-36, on 26 March 1930. The two aircraft were to differ only in the engines fitted, with the XO-35 having geared Curtiss V-1570-29 Conqueror engines, while the XO-36 used direct-drive V-1570-23, which both produced each.

The Douglas design had gull wings mounted high on the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, the engines being suspended in streamlined nacelles under the wings by bracing struts. A retractable tailwheel undercarriage was fitted, the mainwheels retracting into the engine nacelles. The fuselage was a semi-monocoque structure with corrugated duralumin covering, which housed the aircraft&#x27;s crew of four: a nose gunner/observer, a pilot whose cockpit was situated ahead of the leading edge of the wing, an upper gunner who sat in a cockpit aft of the wing, and a radio operator housed within the fuselage. Armament was two .30 in machine guns.

The projected performance of the new twin-engined Douglas and Fokker observation aircraft was much greater than the Keystone biplanes (the Keystone B-3, B-4, B-5 and B-6) that equipped the Air Corps light bomber squadrons, and both Fokker and Douglas were instructed to complete one of their prototypes as a bomber, with the XO-36 being redesignated the XB-7, with provision to carry up to of bombs on racks under the fuselage added.

The XO-36 made its first flight at the Santa Monica, California factory of Douglas in spring 1931. On 22 August 1931, the Air Corps placed an order for a small batch of service test aircraft, consisting of seven Y1B-7 bombers and five Y1O-35 observation aircraft. These differed from the prototypes by having smooth fuselage skins rather than the corrugated skins used on the prototype, while the fuselage was longer to adjust the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity. A revised fuel system was fitted, with more fuel carried in order to give the two-hour endurance specified by the Air Corps. More powerful Conqueror engines were fitted, with all aircraft using geared engines as used on the XO-35.

==Operational history==
The XO-35 was delivered to the Air Corps at its test center at Wright Field, Ohio on 24 October 1931, with the XB-7 following in July 1932. The twelve service test aircraft were completed between November 1932 and March 1933. The Y1B-7s equipped the 11th and 31st Bombardment Squadrons at March Field, California, while the Y1O-35s were issued to a number of Squadrons, including the 88th Observation Squadron at Brooks Field, Texas. One notable early use of the Y1B-7 was during a May 1933 exercise at Fort Knox, where it was able to outrun biplane fighters like the Boeing P-12, showing that the Air Corps needed more modern fighters.

Despite the aircraft&#x27;s superior performance to the elderly Keystone biplanes, the Douglas monoplane never entered mass production either in the observation or bomber roles because newer, more capable aircraft, such as the Martin B-10, were under development while a change in Air Corps policy meant that it was no longer interested in buying more twin-engined observation aircraft.

In February 1934, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt cancelled all air mail contracts owing to a scandal relating to the award of contracts, thus initiating the Airmail Emergency, where the Air Corps was tasked with carrying the mail until new contracts could be awarded. The O-35s and B-7s were considered some of the most suitable aircraft in the Air Corps inventory for the air mail role, so the six remaining Y1B-7s and the five Y1O-35s, together with the XO-35, were assigned to air mail routes in the western United States, which included hazardous operations over the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada. By the time the Air Corps involvement in air mail flights ended in June 1934, the twelve O-35s and B-7s had flown 1,412 hours on mail flights, while four of the B-7s had been lost as a result of accidents. The last O-35s and B-7s were withdrawn from use in December 1938.

<doc id="871834" wikidata="Q1123016" url="?curid=871834" title="Mortification (band)">
<text>Mortification was an Australian Christian death metal band which was formed in 1987 as a heavy metal group, Lightforce, by mainstay Steve Rowe on bass guitar and vocals. By 1990, in the Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin, they were renamed as Mortification with the line-up of Rowe, Michael Carlisle on guitar and Jayson Sherlock on drums. Mortification has released fourteen studio albums, three compilation albums, three extended plays, six live discs, one demo album, one box set, and several videos on major record labels such as Nuclear Blast. As one of the earliest internationally successful Christian death metal bands from Australia, they served as an inspiration for later similar groups.

During the early 1990s, Mortification played death and thrash metal. After the departure of Sherlock, Mortification began experimenting with groove metal, hardcore punk and power metal. They achieved commercial success with &quot;Blood World&quot; in 1994 and received critical acclaim for 1996&#x27;s &quot;EnVision EvAngelene&quot;. Despite the lack of subsequent commercial success or mainstream critical recognition, &quot;the band, in spite of their extreme sound, are some kind of superstars in the &#x27;White Metal&#x27; scene&quot;, and have been described as &quot;a legend in the death metal scene.&quot;

In late 1996, Rowe was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and took 18 months to recover. Mortification issued their tenth album, &quot;Triumph of Mercy&quot; in August 1998 and accompanied it with a tour of North America. By August 1999, the band had sold a total of a quarter of a million albums across Europe and the US. They returned to their death/thrash roots for the 2004 album, &quot;Brain Cleaner&quot;.

== History ==

=== Original line-up ===
In 1987, bass guitarist and vocalist Steve Rowe formed the Australian power metal band LightForce with Murray Adams on guitar, Steve Johnson on vocals and Errol Willenberg on drums. The group played on the local metal scene and signed with United States label, Pure Metal Records to release their debut album, &quot;Mystical Thieves&quot; in May 1989. They supported US Christian glam metallers Stryper on their 1989 tour of Australia. In 1990, Rowe, was determined to play heavy music with a Christian message, and was joined by drummer Jayson Sherlock and guitarist Cameron Hall under the LightForce name to record the demo &quot;Break the Curse&quot;. The group had changed musically towards thrash metal with a death metal influence and when Michael Carlisle replaced Hall on guitar, they were renamed Mortification. According to Rowe, the name comes from the &quot;King James Bible&quot;, &quot;Mortify therefore the deeds of the flesh.&quot; &quot;Break the Curse&quot; was released in 1991 as Mortification&#x27;s second album.
In early 1991, they released their self-titled debut album on the US Christian label Intense Records. The direction of the music had changed once again. A lot of the songs were taken from their demo &quot;Break the Curse&quot;, but the band tuned their guitars down, and the feel to the songs was a lot more heavy and doomy than on previous material. Also, Rowe proved to be an excellent death metal vocalist, presenting his &quot;Grind Baritone vocals of extreme reality&quot; throughout the album. According to AllMusic, the band &quot;sought to provide a positive alternative to traditional death metal acts such as Carcass, Death and Obituary. On the strength of their self-titled 1990 debut, Mortification quickly gained a reputation in their native Australia for being one of the loudest and fastest bands around.&quot;

In 1992, the band signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records in Germany, which had many European death metal groups on their roster. Mortification released their third album, &quot;Scrolls of the Megilloth&quot;, which had great success and, in the Christian metal scene, is considered a classic as well as a piece of Australian metal history. The line-up had outdone themselves, playing some fast death metal with a few doom metal influences on a couple of tracks. According to AllMusic, the album contains &quot;some of the most frightening vocals ever recorded.&quot;

Jayson Sherlock had his last concert with the band at the Black Stump Festival &#x27;93, and the concert was released both on CD and also VHS under the name &quot;Live Planetarium&quot;. A big US major magazine cited the &quot;Live Planetarium&quot; video as the best live album and video they have ever seen and heard.

The band released a new album in 1994 called &quot;Blood World&quot;. They leaned more towards modern groove/thrash with classic metal and hardcore punk influence rather than death metal, and Steve mainly used his shouts rather than growling. Phil and Michael left the band, and Steve stood by himself. The strange combination of extreme styles began setting Mortification apart from the crowd of same sounding bands and widened the band&#x27;s audience as they became quickly recognized as innovators and not imitators. &quot;Blood World&quot; received rave reviews in America and Europe. Horror Infernal Magazine gave the album 13 out of 13 points.

=== Rowe diagnosed with leukaemia ===
In late 1996, Steve Rowe was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia, and after 18 months he was in remission despite a seemingly failed bone marrow transplant. Soon after, Mortification recorded their tenth album, &quot;Triumph of Mercy&quot;, and released it in August 1998. It was issued by Rowe Productions in the US and Nuclear Blast Germany in Europe. Lyrically, the album focused on the experiences of Rowe and the band during the previous two-years. The style of the album was a mixture of groove and thrash. They followed with a North American tour.

1999 saw the release of &quot;Hammer of God&quot;, also a mix of thrash and groove. The death metal elements had vanished, but the religious message of the lyrics remained. The band&#x27;s line-up was Rowe, with Keith Bannister on drums and Lincoln Bowen on guitar. They undertook another European tour to promote &quot;Hammer of God&quot;. By August that year, the group had sold a total of a quarter of a million albums across Europe and the US.

In 2000, Mortification released another live album, recorded at Black Stump Festival in 1999, called &quot;10 Years Live Not Dead&quot;, which mainly featured material from their newer albums plus a new song called &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;. Keith Bannister left the band, and a replacement was found in the very young drummer Adam Zaffarese.

The new line-up released the album &quot;The Silver Cord is Severed&quot; in 2000 and the band went on its first world tour. The music continued to be thrash and groove. While many fans thought the album was the weakest effort in the band&#x27;s career, &quot;The Silver Cord is Severed&quot; sold well like its processors. This was due to the fact that – like Nuclear Blast founder Markus Staiger stated in a newsletter – had become &quot;some kind of superstars in the Christian metal scene&quot;.

=== Return to death/thrash roots ===
In early 2008, the band&#x27;s nine early records were re-released by Polish Metal Mind Productions.

On 6 June, it was announced that Mortification will record a new album in 2009. On 5 August, the band stated that they would record a demo for the new album. On 4 February, Rowe announced that the album titled &quot;The Evil Addiction Destroying Machine&quot; was partially completed, and it was released early June. Confusing many fans, Steve Rowe has reportedly called the new musical direction &quot;easy-listening thrash&quot;. Rowe noted in a message for The Metal Resource about the reception of &quot;The Evil Addiction Destroying Machine&quot;: &quot;With all new Mort releases there have been mixed response; pretty black and white. Some Really Like It and some really Don&#x27;t Like It. But I knew with presenting the band in a reinvented way it was an excitingly dangerous move!&quot;

In 2016, Rowe spoke in an interview about a re-pressing of &quot;Post Momentary Affliction&quot; on vinyl. He stated that former drummer Jayson Sherlock redesigned the artwork.

== Reception and legacy ==
Mortification was described by Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop&quot; in 1999: &quot;During the early 1990s, Mortification became internationally known as Australia&#x27;s foremost Christian-inspired death metal band. Christian death metal: surely a contradiction in terms; but only for the uninitiated. Mortification successfully infused the down-tuned, sledgehammer riffs and gruff vocal style usually associated with the death/thrash metal genre with positive and spiritually uplifting lyric themes.&quot;

Records released after Steve Rowe&#x27;s leukemia have received poor reviews from critics, though they kept selling well. A critic wrote that &quot;The weakest link of current Mortification are the lyrics. They are just somewhat naive and cheesy. On the old albums sinners screamed in pain in the fiery pits of hell, Satan was slaughtered; the rhetoric&#x27;s fit the spirit of the brutal music better. Apparently the fatherhood and going through the disease has calmed Rowe down too much, although on the early records the previous members Jayson Sherlock and Mick Carlisle wrote a lot of the lyrics.&quot; The different singing style Rowe did for many years after &quot;Post Momentary Affliction&quot; was another target for criticism, being called &quot;poor screaming&quot;.

According to Australian writers Gary Garson and Peter Schultz, Mortification is the world&#x27;s most successful Christian extreme metal band. Their first three albums are respected efforts of death metal. &quot;Blood World&quot; was a commercial hit and &quot;EnVision EvAngelene&quot; gained some respect for its music. During the tour for &quot;Blood World&quot; they played with Napalm Death, Sick of It All and Entombed for audiences consisting of thousands of people, and sold more merchandise than the other bands in the venues.

In &quot;Raised by Wolves&quot;, author John J. Thompson pointed out that upon forming Mortification, Rowe &quot;suddenly had one of the most credible Christian death metal bands in the world on his hands.&quot; Thompson defined Mortification as &quot;one of the heaviest bands ever to hit the Christian scene&quot; and described its albums as &quot;a blatantly evangelistic work of shredding death metal.&quot;

Discussing the social aspects of the extreme metal scene, author Keith Kahn-Harris wrote that overt Christian bands like Mortification are often &quot;strongly criticized if their commitment to music is perceived to be subordinate to their commitment to politics.&quot; Kahn-Harris observed that &quot;with a very few exceptions, overt Christian bands tend to be confined to their own, largely autonomous scenes.&quot; But he acknowledges that &quot;music and scene can never be detached from flows of power and capital and hence a non-political scene is an impossibility. [...] The scene is enmeshed in relations of power and capital, despite its relative autonomy as a field.&quot;
