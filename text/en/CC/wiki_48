After completing school, he attended Grey University College between 1921 and 1925 where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Dutch &amp; Ethics) and Master of Arts (Philosophy). As an economist, he educated himself overseas at universities in Munich, Cologne, Berlin and Leiden, obtaining a doctorate from the University of Leiden and a D.Litt degree. Resuming a career in South Africa, he became a lecturer and later a professor at the University of the Orange Free State, in Political Science and Philosophy. During the 1930s and 1940s, he became a prominent figure in Afrikaner nationalist circles. He founded the &quot;Reddingsdaadbond&quot; organisation to promote the economic wellbeing of Afrikaners.

After visiting the country in 1938, Diederichs became a staunch admirer of Nazi Germany.

Diederichs was a National Party member of Parliament from 1953 to 1975. He served as Minister of Economic Affairs from 1958 to 1967, as Minister of Mines from 1961 to 1964, and as Minister of Finance from 1967 to 1975. In the latter capacity he became known as &quot;Mr Gold&quot;. He served as the first chancellor of the Rand Afrikaans University and ceremonial State President of South Africa from 1975 until his death, after a short illness, of a heart attack on 21 August 1978 in Cape Town.

==Honours==

Diederichs was honoured with medals from various countries. he was awarded a gold medal from the City of Paris (1971), made a Knight of the Greater Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1973, and an Order of Merit from Paraguay in 1974. He was awarded honorary doctoral degrees from the University of the Orange Free State and the University of Stellenbosch.

<text>The Atalanta was an English car manufactured in Greenwich, southeast London (then part of Kent until 1941) from 1915 to 1917. One of a number of light car companies to start business during the First World War, the Atalanta was one of the latest startups. The 9 hp light car sold for £195 with a non-proprietary four-cylinder 1097 cc engine.

The wartime economy was not good to them, and the business closed their doors by February 1917.

The company had no connection with the better known Atalanta of Staines, Middlesex made between 1937 and 1939.

<text>An academy of sciences is a type of learned society or academy (as special scientific institution) dedicated to sciences that may or may not be state funded. Some state funded academies are national, or royal (i.e. United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge) as a form of honor. 

The other type of academies are &quot;Academy of Arts&quot; or combination of both (e.g., American Academy of Arts and Sciences).
&quot;Academy of Letters&quot; is another related expression, encompassing literature.
In non-English-speaking countries, the range of academic fields of the members of a national Academy of Science often includes scholarly disciplines which would not normally be classed as &quot;science&quot; in English. Many languages use a broad term for systematized learning which includes both natural sciences and social sciences and fields such as literary studies, linguistics, history, or art history. (Often these terms are calques from Latin (the etymological source of English &quot;science&quot;) and, accordingly, derivatives of the verb &#x27;know&#x27;, such as German , Swedish , Hungarian , Estonian or Finnish .) Accordingly, for example the Austrian Academy of Sciences (), the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (), or the Estonian Academy of Sciences () also cover the areas of social sciences and humanities.
As the engineering sciences have become more varied and advanced, there is a recent trend in many advanced countries to organize the National Academy of Engineering (or National Academy of Engineering Sciences), separate from the national academy of sciences. 

Academies of science play an important role in science diplomacy efforts.
Academies are increasingly organized in regional or even international academies. The Interacademy Partnership for example is a global network consisting of over 140 national, regional and global member academies of science, engineering and medicine. Pan-Europe academies include the Academia Europaea and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. Additionally, there are many regional associations such as ALLEA in Europe, NASAC as the Network of African Science Academies, IANAS in Latin America, and AASSA in Asia. 
The International Science Council brings together international scientific unions and associations as well as national and regional scientific organizations such as academies and research councils from the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities. 

Apart from national academies of science, there are now increasingly also national young academies. National young academies usually select members for a limited term, normally 4–5 years, after which members become academy alumni. Young academies typically engage with issues important to young scientists. These include, for example, science education or the dialog between science and society. Most young academies are affiliated with a senior Academy of Sciences or with a network of senior academies. The Global Young Academy, which itself is a science academy (e.g. full member of Interacademy Partnership) often serves as a facilitator of the growing global network of young academies. Since its creation, more than 35 national young academies have been established. In 2019, there were 41 national young academies.

<text>Father Peter Heier (September 16, 1895 – March 24, 1982), S.V.D. was a Roman Catholic priest of Hague, North Dakota.

Peter Heier was the son of George and Magdalena (Wolf) Heier. He was born in (today Malodolynske), Ukraine. His family immigrated to the United States and settled in North Dakota. Heier studied for the priesthood and was stationed in Hague, North Dakota, where he also served as an exorcist. He served as a Divine Word missionary in China, where he was put in charge of a noted demonic possession case in 1926 and again in 1929, concerning a Chinese woman named Lautien in Henan, China. The case was printed up in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Begone Satan&quot; by Father Celestine Kapsner in 1928.

Heier died in Conesus, New York.

<text>Milwaukee Deep, also known as the Milwaukee Depth, is the deepest part of the Puerto Rico Trench, constituting the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean. Together with the surrounding seabed area, known as Brownson Deep, the Milwaukee Deep forms an elongated depression that constitutes the floor of the trench. As there is no geomorphological distinction between the two, it has been proposed that the use of both names to refer to distinct areas should be reviewed.

During the Five Deeps Expedition, explorer Victor Vescovo achieved the first crewed descent to the location on 21 December 2018. Media outlets overwhelmingly referred to the area as the Brownson Deep, while the name Milwaukee Deep was used by others. However, likely due to the factors mentioned above, the expedition has not used any particular name to refer to the site of their Atlantic dive. It is named for the USS &quot;Milwaukee&quot;, which recorded the first echo soundings of the Puerto Rico Trench in 1939, and was itself named for the city of Milwaukee.Located roughly north of the coast of the main island of Puerto Rico at &quot;Punto Palmas Altas&quot; in Manatí, the maximum depth of the Milwaukee Deep is , as directly measured by Vescovo during his 2018 descent to the deepest point of the Atlantic Ocean. The maximum depth of the Milwaukee Deep has also been reported at in 1940 by geologist and oceanographer Thomas Wayland Vaughan, in 1954 by John Lyman, professor of oceanography at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and in 2014 by the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO), and in 2018 by marine geologist Heather Stewart and marine biologist Alan Jamieson. Stewart and Jamieson also reported a maximum depth of in 2019 and in 2021.
== History ==

The ocean floor feature is named for the USS &quot;Milwaukee&quot; (CL-5), a U.S. Navy Omaha class cruiser, which discovered the Milwaukee Deep on February 14, 1939 with a reading of . On August 19, 1952, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife vessel &quot;Theodore N. Gill&quot; obtained a reading of at (), virtually identical with the &quot;Milwaukee&quot;″s reading. By then, the existence of deep water to the Atlantic Ocean side of the Caribbean had been known for more than a century.

One of the area&#x27;s earliest soundings was obtained June 12, 1852 by Lt. S. P. Lee, U.S. Navy brig &quot;Dolphin&quot;, with a reading of at ().

=== Crewed descents ===
In 1964, the French submersible &quot;Archimède&quot; explored the Puerto Rico Trench to a depth of approximately but did not reach its deepest point.

On 21 December 2018 Victor Vescovo made the first crewed descent to the deepest point of the trench in the Deep-Submergence Vehicle &quot;DSV Limiting Factor&quot; (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) and measured a depth of by direct CTD pressure measurements. This made the &quot;Limiting Factor&quot; the deepest diving operational submersible at the time.

<doc id="858219" wikidata="Q753296" url="?curid=858219" title="Atalanta (1937 automobile)">
<text>The Atalanta was an English automobile manufactured from 1937 until 1939 by Atalanta Motors Ltd in Staines, Middlesex. Two models were made.

==History==
The 1937 car used Albert Gough&#x27;s somewhat erratic 4-cylinder overhead-cam 1496 cc 78 bhp and 1996 cc 98 bhp engines with three valves and two spark plugs per cylinder which had been previously fitted to some Frazer Nashes where Gough had worked. An Arnott supercharged version was also available. Three or four-speed gearboxes were offered. The car had a tubular steel chassis and all round independent suspension using coil springs. Two-seat open sports and two-seat drophead coupé bodies built by Abbott were available.

From 1938 the car could be had with a 4·3-litre V-12 Lincoln-Zephyr engine giving 112 bhp which proved to be the more popular. The car had a 3-speed gearbox. A four-seat version on a slightly longer chassis was made as well as the two-seaters.

A 1496cc version raced in the 1938 Le Mans 24 hour race driven by Charles Morrison &amp; Neil Watson (one of the company founders). The car retired with a broken driveshaft.

The cars were very expensive and the outbreak of war stopped production after only about 20 cars were made. The company continued in existence making pumps and becoming Atalanta Engineering Ltd.

==RGS Atalanta==
Richard Gaylard Shattock revived the name after the Second World War with the RGS Atalanta, offering complete cars with fiberglass bodywork or parts kits until 1958. Lea-Francis, Ford and Jaguar engines were used, at least 1 car was equipped with an Aston Martin DB2/4 2.6 L or 3 L triple SU H6 carburettor engine.
In the late 1930s there was also an open sports version of the Atalanta, with a huge 7L American side-valve engine and an 8- position, gated gear change. 

Also a smaller-engined open sports version using an OHV engine with a blower.

==Other cars with the Atalanta name==
There was another unconnected Atalanta company based in Greenwich, London which built a few 9 hp four-cylinder cars from 1916 to 1917.

Atalanta was a name also used on a car made by the rather mysterious Owen of London, England in about 1910. This company existed between 1899 and 1935 but seems to have made very few if any cars.

Atalanta was also a sports-tourer version of the 20/25 hp Armstrong Siddeley line, sold between 1936 and 1938.

A new sports car manufactured by Atalanta Motors Ltd of Staffordshire was shown in 2012 and at the 2014 Hampton Court Palace Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

<text>The Athmac was a short-lived English cyclecar which was manufactured by Athmac Motor Company of Leyton, then in Essex (now part of Greater London) in 1913. The friction-driven car, named 10/12, was propelled by a 1,110 cc four-cylinder engine. It featured final drive by long belts to the rear axle and was supposed to sell at 120 guineas, but production never got off the ground.

<doc id="858224" wikidata="Q4815947" url="?curid=858224" title="Atla (automobile)">
<text>The Atla is a French automobile that was manufactured from 1957 to 1959 in the commune of Garches in the western suburbs of Paris.

==Background and development==
The Atla was a project of Jacques Durand, who served as chief designer and assistant engineer. Prior to starting work on the Atla Durand made small-displacement engines for motorized toys and later began using the engines in his own line of scale-models of sports cars like the Jaguar D-Type and the Mercedes-Benz 300SL. In 1957 he visited the workshops of Chappe et Gessalin to see what was involved in producing automobile bodywork in fibreglass and soon progressed to making a body for a full-sized car of his own design. It was Durand who named the car the `Atla&#x27; (&quot;A.T.L.A.&quot; in some references).

Development of the prototype took place in Durand&#x27;s workshop in the cellar of his family&#x27;s home in Antony. This was where the molds that would be used for laying up the fibreglass body were made and the first chassis was fabricated. It is said that Durand had to demolish the staircase going to the basement of the house to get the first car out of the workshop.

Durand designed a small berlinette whose shape drew on cars that he had already produced as scale-models. The Atla&#x27;s nose was reminiscent of the D-type and it had &quot;portes papillon&quot;, or gull-wing doors like those on the 300SL.

The car rode on a custom chassis that was designed for it by an acquaintance of Durand&#x27;s named Charles Cusson. Cusson engineered a tubular steel space-frame that was very rigid and weighed approximately .

Jean Schwab, who had a Renault dealership in Garches, not only handled sales of the car but also provided the financial support needed to put the car into full production and even supplied some of the necessary Renault parts used in building the car. Robert Jonet, who worked for Schwab, was transferred to the Atla shop full-time to assist in painting and trimming the cars. Schwab, who was a part-time racing driver, used his contacts to have the prototype Atla tested by the French automotive press. The magazine &quot;l&#x27;Automobile&quot; featured the car in an in-depth article and on its cover in its Issue 147 of July 1958. Feedback from these evaluations was used by the Atla team to make changes to the car before it went into production.

Production of the car was moved from Durand&#x27;s workshop in Antony to Garches.

==Atla Renault==
Powering the car was Renault&#x27;s Billancourt engine, mounted behind the rear wheels in a rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. The Atla could be bought in kit form or as a completed car. Two levels of kit were available. A basic kit included a bare body shell with the doors, hood and rear hatch mounted on hinges and the chassis with all attachment points and cost 250,000 Francs. A more complete kit could be had that included a painted body and an upholstered interior. This kit also came with all handles, a wiring loom and a fuel tank already installed. This version cost 650,000 Francs.

Complete cars were offered in four different versions; two standard and two competition. A completely assembled Atla Type 750 used the version from the Renault 4CV that produced , and came with a 3-speed manual transaxle. The Atla Type 850 used the engine from the Renault Dauphine that developed , and also had a 3-speed manual transaxle. The 750 model weighed just and the 850 model was slightly heavier at .

The first competition version, called either the Monza or Rally, also had a 750 cc engine but came with a 4-speed manual transaxle. The highest performance version was called the Sebring, and it came with an 850 cc engine and a 4-speed manual transaxle. A 5-speed transaxle was an option. Engines in the Monza/Rally and Sebring models were tuned by Autobleu and received Solex 32mm carburetors, performance camshafts, larger valves and new valve springs, modified cylinder heads and custom exhaust systems. These changes raised power output for the 750 to and as much as for the 850. The competition cars were slightly heavier than the standard cars.

==Atla Panhard==
At least one car was built with Atla bodywork and the air-cooled boxer-twin engine and transaxle from a Panhard Dyna Z in a front-engine, front-wheel-drive configuration. Apart from that the number built and attribution of the Atla Panhard is debated.

Some references say that the Panhard drive-train was a factory option, and that six cars were built by them at a second assembly location in Malakoff.

Others report that only one such car was built at the request of one specific customer. Uncorroborated claims have been made that it was built by another company and used the Atla body but a chassis from another car. An Atla Panhard was reported to be in the United States for several years before being repatriated to France.

==Release to end of production==
The prototype was complete by 1957 and the car went into production the next year. The Type 750 was priced at 860,000 Francs and the Type 850 cost 950,000 Francs. At a time when a Renault 4CV cost 419,000 Francs, a Dauphine 574,000 Francs and the larger Frégate 929,000 Francs the Atla was competitively positioned in the market.

After sales of about 20 cars the factory reviewed their production costs and increased the price of the car significantly, to 1,000,000 Francs. This major price increase caused orders to essentially stop, crippling the finances of the company. Production of the Atla ended shortly after, having only been built for little over one year. The total number of Atlas built is estimated to have been fewer than thirty cars.

After the Atla project ended Durand went on to design several other cars, the first of which was the Sera. He and Cusson also partnered on another short-lived car project called the ALPA years later.

==Atla in motorsports==
An Atla made several appearances in the short film &quot;Au Rallye de Genève&quot; of 1959.

An Atla-Renault was raced for several seasons in Sweden.

<text>The Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (OSR) is a Swiss symphony orchestra, based in Geneva at the Victoria Hall. In addition to symphony concerts, the OSR performs as the opera orchestra in productions at the Grand Théâtre de Genève.

==History==
Ernest Ansermet founded the OSR in 1918, together with Paul Lachenal, with a contingent of 48 players and a season of six months&#x27; duration. Besides Swiss musicians, the OSR players initially came from other countries, including Austria, France, Germany and Italy. Ansermet gradually increased the percentage of Swiss musicians in the orchestra, attaining 80% Swiss personnel by 1946. He remained the music director of the OSR for 49 years, from 1918 to 1967.

A Swiss radio orchestra based in Lausanne was merged into the OSR in 1938. Subsequently, the OSR began to broadcast radio concerts regularly on Swiss radio. The orchestra had a long-standing contract for recordings with Decca Records, dating from the tenure of Ansermet, and made over 300 recordings for Decca, starting in 1947 with Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La mer&quot;. The OSR premiered many works of the Swiss composers Arthur Honegger and Frank Martin. During the directorship of Armin Jordan (1985–1997), the OSR continued to make recordings on the Erato label.

From 2005 to 2012, Marek Janowski was the artistic director and music director of the OSR. He conducted the OSR in recordings for the Pentatone label. In September 2008, his initial 5-year contract had been extended to 2015, but in January 2010, in a change to the September 2008 contract extension, Janowski and the OSR mutually agreed on the scheduled conclusion of his directorship of the OSR after the 2011–12 season.

Following the announcement of Janowski&#x27;s scheduled 2012 departure, attempts to secure Bertrand de Billy and Kazuki Yamada as the OSR&#x27;s next artistic leader did not come to fruition. In September 2010, the OSR named Neeme Järvi as its ninth artistic and musical director, and in parallel, Yamada as principal guest conductor, with both appointments effective as of 2012, with initial contracts of 3 years for both conductors. Järvi has commercially recorded with the OSR for the Chandos label. He concluded his OSR directorship after the 2014–2015 season.

Jonathan Nott first guest-conducted the OSR in October 2014. Following these concert appearances, in January 2015, the OSR named Nott its next music and artistic director, effective January 2017. The OSR formalised the new contract and relationship with Nott in March 2016. In February 2021, the OSR announced the conversion of Nott&#x27;s OSR contract into an evergreen, open-ended lifetime agreement with no set final date.

There is an anecdotal fact taken from recording notes by Roy Wallace that the orchestra&#x27;s bass drum in their &quot;golden age&quot; of recording had the largest circumference in the world.

In 2023, Pierluigi Christophe Orunesu&#x27;s company Cyber&#x27;Art developed the icologram initiative, a digital startup enabling virtual artist presence, and collaborated with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande to record the first holographic symphonic performance presented at Artgenève 2024.

<text>Coterra Energy Inc. is an American energy company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration based in Houston, Texas. The company has operations in the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale, and the Anadarko Basin.

, the company had of estimated proved reserves, of which 85% was natural gas, 7% was petroleum, and 8% was natural gas liquids.

==History==
The company was formed as Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corporation, a subsidiary of Cabot Corporation. It became a public company via an initial public offering in February 1990. In March 1991, the company became 100% publicly owned.

In 1994, the company acquired Washington Energy Resources in a $180 million stock transaction.

In May 1995, the company ousted John Lollar, its chairman and CEO, in part due to the ill-timing of the acquisition of Washington Energy Resources.

In 1997, the company sold oil reserves and land in northwest Pennsylvania for $92.5 million.

In 2001, the company acquired Cody Energy for $230 million.

In June 2008, the company was added to the S&amp;P 500.

In 2013, the company sold its assets in the Marmaton play of Oklahoma and West Texas for $160 million.

In March 2018, the company sold its assets in the Eagle Ford Group to KKR and Venado Oil &amp; Gas.

In October 2021, the company acquired Cimarex Energy and was renamed Coterra Energy.

==Controversies==
===Environmental damage===
In 2009, the company was cited for violations in regard to spills of toxic hydraulic fracturing fluids in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

In 2012, the company was cited for improper well construction that had resulted in polluted drinking water.

===Restraining order on anti-fracking activist===
In January 2014, the company sought, and a judge granted, a temporary injunction barring anti-fracking activist Vera Scroggins from entering on any of the 312.5 square miles of land in Pennsylvania owned or leased by the company. The company acknowledged that Scroggins had not violated any laws, but the lawsuit was due to her being a &quot;nuisance&quot; at company sites. In March 2014, the judge narrowed the injunction to prevent Scroggins only from going within 100 feet of an active well pad and 25 feet of an inactive well pad, access road or access road entrance.

<doc id="858227" wikidata="Q3216454" url="?curid=858227" title="Lake Compounce">
<text>Lake Compounce is an amusement park located in Bristol and Southington, Connecticut. Opened in 1846, it is the oldest continuously operating amusement park in the United States. It spans , which includes a beach and a water park called Crocodile Cove, both included in the price of admission. The park was acquired from Kennywood Entertainment Company by Palace Entertainment, the U.S. subsidiary of Parques Reunidos. In addition to the 14th oldest wooden roller coaster in the world, Wildcat, its newer wooden roller coaster, Boulder Dash, has won the Golden Ticket Award for the #1 Wooden Coaster in the World for five consecutive years.

== History ==
The lake&#x27;s name is derived from Chief John Compound, a Mattatuck-Tunxis Native American. On December 3, 1684, his tribe signed a deed that left Compound&#x27;s Lake to a group of white settlers, including John Norton, who had migrated to central Connecticut from Massachusetts. The property was left to the settlers in exchange for a small amount of money and miscellaneous items, including a large brass tea kettle.

=== Early days ===
The park&#x27;s history goes back to 1846, when Gad Norton hired a scientist to perform an experiment using explosives, which failed. The experiment brought large crowds, which inspired Norton to open an amusement park. His park had public swimming and rowing on the lake, a gazebo for lakeside band concerts, and several rides. The park saw success as a picnic park through the post-American Civil War era.

In 1851, a California Gold Rush 49er named Isaac Pierce joined Norton to establish a firm. The two men petitioned local legislators and asked that their residences be ceded from the town of Southington to the town of Bristol. In 1895, a casino was built on the property, which was the first permanent building at the site. Later that year, the Bristol and Plainville Tramway Company constructed the Southington and Compounce trolley line. Shortly after, Lake Compounce purchased the Lake Compounce Carousel for $10,000. The Carousel is included in the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1914, Lake Compounce opened Green Dragon, the park&#x27;s first electric-powered roller coaster. The coaster was torn down in 1927 to make room for Wildcat, a wooden coaster designed by Herbert Schmeck and built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company.

The early 1930s brought more growth to the park. The casino was expanded with the addition of a dance floor. An all-time attendance record of 5,000 people was set in the spring of 1941, when Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s reorganized band featured Frank Sinatra, who had yet to reach the height of his career.

The effects of the Great Depression and the growing usage of the automobile brought trolleys in the United States into a decline, which negatively impacted attendance at Lake Compounce. These same factors had similar effects on other parks in the New England region, such as Canobie Lake Park and Riverside Park. In 1944, Lake Compounce opened a steam railroad. It was designed and built by Connecticut actor William Gillette, the original actor of Sherlock Holmes in silent films.

=== New ownership ===
The park&#x27;s success was stable until the late 1960s, when attendance began to decline. Lake Compounce remained under the ownership of the Pierce and Norton Corporation until 1966, when Edward G. Pierce sold his share to the Norton family. The Nortons owned and operated the park through 1985 and were able to restore some profitability and raise attendance. No major attractions were added during this time, and the Nortons listed the park for sale in 1984. In 1985, Lake Compounce was sold to the Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company, owners of Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania, who briefly renamed the park to &quot;Hershey&#x27;s Lake Compounce&quot;. Factors such as poor marketing, low attendance, and repeated ride outages caused Hershey to sell the park after two seasons in 1987, a decision that upset local representatives.

In the spring of 1987, Joseph Entertainment Group (JEG), owned by Joseph Balestieri, bought the park and renamed it &quot;Lake Compounce Festival Park&quot;. The park received renovations, and in 1988 a 20,000-seat outdoor amphitheater was added. One of the first notable musical acts to perform at the new venue was the group Milli Vanilli, and their live performance was broadcast on MTV in what was later recognized as the first public sign that they were lip-syncing. JEG focused more of their attention on concert promotion and neglected the amusement park portion of the property. The Wildcat roller coaster and other rides were nonoperational by 1991. That year, JEG&#x27;s financial troubles were exposed when a check the company wrote to Guns N&#x27; Roses bounced, and the performance was cancelled. It was later discovered that JEG was nearly $900,000 behind in taxes and had not refunded nearly $300,000 to ticket-holders for 15 cancelled concerts.

At the end of the 1991 season, Joseph Entertainment Group filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and did not open the park for the 1992 season. The park was put up for sale at a very low price. After being unable to find a buyer, JEG filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and liquidated the park. The land and what was left of the rides and buildings were sold to Stephen Barberino. The park remained closed for the 1992 and 1993 seasons. In 1993, Funtime Parks, owner of Geauga Lake Park and Darien Lake Park, among other parks, became Barberino&#x27;s management partner. The existing rides were repaired, several new rides were added, and waterslides were constructed on the beach and lake areas. The park reopened for the 1994 season. That year, Funtime merged with Premier Parks, which later became Six Flags. Premier Parks and Barberino then put Lake Compounce up for sale again in 1995. Companies including Cedar Fair, Alpha Smartparks, and the Kennywood Entertainment Company made offers.

=== Kennywood and Parques Reunidos ===

Early in 1996, Kennywood Entertainment Company, owners of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Kennywood amusement park, signed an agreement to purchase Lake Compounce. That year the park added several new rides and a Boomerang roller coaster. The park prospered as a family amusement park, rather than a thrill park. In 2000, the roller coaster Boulder Dash was opened, and later received the 2004 Golden Ticket Award for the #1 Wood Roller Coaster from &quot;Amusement Today&quot;. In late 2007, Kennywood Entertainment Company sold its parks to the Spain-based Parques Reunidos company.

More recent plans have included a significant expansion of the Crocodile Cove water park. This has required the moving of nearby Mount Vernon Road to the north to allow the park more room for expansion. The road move was expected to cost $6 million, while the additions to the water park were expected to cost $15 million. In 2013, the park added the Bayou Bay wave pool. In 2014, the park added an off-site campground called Bear Creek Campground with cabins, tent and RV spaces, and a main lodge. The campground was renamed to Lake Compounce Campground in 2021 during park&#x27;s 175th season.

In 2016, the park added a new roller coaster called Phobia Phear Coaster, a Sky Rocket II model from Premier Rides. Phobia Phear Coaster features three linear synchronous motor (LSM) launches and a heartline roll at high. General Manager Jerry Brick stated that the coaster was the biggest investment in the park&#x27;s history.

In early July 2017, Lake Compounce shut down Sky Ride — a twenty-five minute round trip chairlift from the park up to the top of the Southington Mountain ridge. The non-ski chairlift was one of the rides brought to the park by Kennywood Entertainment in 1997. The decommissioning came after a chairlift accident at Six Flags Great Escape on June 24, 2017. The remote and inaccessible nature of the lift&#x27;s path and terminus on top of Southington Mountain were cited by Brick as reasons for the closing.

Both the bumper cars and the trolley ride were removed for the 2024 season.

== Events ==
During October, the park runs a Halloween event called Phantom Fall Fest. Rides still operate during the event, and when the sun goes down, scare actors roam the park and four haunted houses open. Before sunset, there are no scare actors or haunted houses, allowing for children to enjoy the park scare-free.

During December, the park holds a Christmas experience for adults and children. There is a selection of children&#x27;s and family rides open, as well as a place to meet Santa. The event also features a 100-foot-tall Christmas tree, which is the largest in Connecticut.

== Former events ==
The park&#x27;s former Halloween event was known as The Haunted Graveyard. Many of the park&#x27;s rides were operated after dark, and a haunted house called The Haunted Graveyard operated as well. The attraction consisted of a 45-minute walk-through of catacombs, castles, special effects, and graveyards. The Haunted Graveyard started in 1991 and relocated to Lake Compounce in 2001, returning every year until its final year in 2020. Portions of the proceeds were donated towards the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

<doc id="858237" wikidata="Q1068710" url="?curid=858237" title="Cheaters (American TV series)">
<text>Cheaters is an American weekly syndicated reality television series featuring couples with one partner who is committing adultery, or cheating, on the other partner. Investigations are headed by the &quot;Cheaters Detective Agency&quot;. The series premiered on October 2, 2000, and ended on May 17, 2021. It has been hosted by Tommy Habeeb, Joey Greco, Clark James Gable and Peter Gunz.

== Format ==

Actor Joey Greco was the show&#x27;s longest-running host, hosting from late 2002 to mid-2012 and returning briefly in 2015. At the onset of the show&#x27;s 13th season, he was replaced by Clark James Gable, the grandson of legendary actor Clark Gable. Gable would host the series until his unexpected death in 2019 due to a drug overdose. In February 2020, it was announced via social media that &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop&quot; star Peter Gunz would become the new host beginning in October 2020. Filming of season 21 took place in Dallas during the summer of 2020, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

The show&#x27;s complainants can be either married or long-term significant others, and have included both opposite-sex and same-sex couples.

Each episode begins with a brief interview of the complainant, detailing how the complainant met their partner and what has led them to believe that the partner is cheating, citing suspicious activities or behavior. Next, the narrator (originally Robert Magruder from 2000-2015, then Ken Eaken since 2015) describes the progress of the investigation of the partner (referred to as &quot;the suspect&quot;). Private investigators follow the suspect over the course of several days or weeks at their home, workplace, and/or in public with their alleged (dubbed &quot;the companion&quot;). If the complainant and suspect live together, hidden cameras are occasionally installed in their home. A recorded telephone conversation between the complainant and suspect, in which the suspect lies about his or her whereabouts, is also played.

When the investigation turns up enough evidence of the suspect&#x27;s infidelity, the show enters its second segment, &quot;the confrontation.&quot; The host meets with the complainant to reveal the findings of the investigation and shows them the evidence collected (originally on a video camera, then on an iPad). The host sometimes warns the complainant that the footage is disturbing or upsetting but the complainant nonetheless requests to see it. Graphic footage from the investigators—for example, the suspect and their companion engaged in a sexual act—is shown uncensored to the complainant but digitally blurred to the show&#x27;s viewers; however, uncensored versions of the encounters have been released on DVD.

The briefing takes place when the suspect and their companion are concurrently being observed together nearby; the intent is to allow the complainant to catch the suspect in the act of infidelity. After contacting the detective on his cell phone to find out their whereabouts, the host and the complainant, along with a full crew of production personnel all carrying 35 mm cameras, and security personnel travel in a van and seek out and confront the alleged cheater. The confrontation often takes place in public places, such as bars, restaurants and parks, with the complainant and host both demanding an explanation from the suspect for their behavior. Confrontations are often violent in nature, forcing security guards to restrain the complainant, suspect and/or companion. Confrontations also have the potential to end badly, as in one episode where host Joey Greco was apparently stabbed during a confrontation on a yacht and transported to a hospital. However, it has been disputed whether or not the stabbing was real or staged. Suspects also have been known to push the security guards, which causes the security guards to push back and let them know that they will retaliate. In very rare cases, animals unwittingly featured will have their heads blurred out for humorous effect.

The final segment, &quot;the conclusion,&quot; presents parting thoughts from the complainant, the suspect and their companion as they depart the scene of the confrontation. Next, updates from previous cases, including interviews from suspects and their companions, are presented. Lastly, the narrator describes what became of the complainant, the suspect and the companion (and in rare cases, others that may also be involved) after the show.

== History ==
The show was created by Bobby Goldstein, an attorney in Dallas, Texas. It made its debut in 2000. The original host of the show was actor Tommy Habeeb aka &quot;Tommy Grand&quot; (2000–2002). 2004 brought syndication reruns of previous seasons, edited into a half-hour Monday-through-Friday strip format with new intros by Joey Greco as host. When &quot;Cheaters&quot; began airing in high-definition, the show&#x27;s title card, used for eleven seasons, was altered to 3D, and more high-definition graphics were incorporated into the show.

== Syndication ==
&quot;Cheaters&quot; aired two episodes on The CW Plus on Saturday nights: a one-hour-long episode followed by a 30-minute episode from 2006-2017 and again from 2018-2019. A 10-minute version of the show called &quot;Cheaters: Amazing Confrontations&quot; is available through on-demand services.

In 2006, G4 began showing the strip version with faster-paced editing and music due to complaints that the show seemed boring and contrived, as well as a different narrator, for weekly airings on its &quot;Midnight Spank&quot; block. On December 9, 2009, G4 moved this show to the short-lived &quot;Junk Food TV&quot; block. G4 stopped airing the show in December 2012.

In January 2017, the syndicated half-hour strip format version of &quot;Cheaters&quot; returned to cable television, this time on VH1 during late Friday nights/early Saturday &amp; Sunday morning slots. &quot;Cheaters&quot; also re-aired on MTV2.

In October 2022, Pluto TV launched a &quot;Cheaters&quot; channel, airing episodes of the 30-minute strip format.

Until December 2022, Cheaters aired on Ion Mystery and TrueReal (prior to its merger with Defy TV).

== Controversy and incidents ==
In 2002, the &quot;Houston Press&quot; tracked down several people who said they were paid $400 per show by one of the detectives of the agency to act on the show, and were paid $50 per referral of other actors. One performer said, &quot;What [the show&#x27;s private detective] told me was that some of the episodes are real, but... they would do these ringer episodes to supplement the show.&quot; The show&#x27;s private investigator denies that he staged anyone&#x27;s scenario and further added that the number of inquiries the agency receives made this unnecessary. The producers of &quot;Cheaters&quot; currently reiterate the reality of each episode in a legalistic message at its end, though a Federal Communications Commission representative confirmed to the &quot;Houston Press&quot; that &quot;there&#x27;s no law or regulation against presenting acted-out scenarios as reality on television.&quot;

On December 16, 2005, four employees of the show, the host Joey Greco, director Hunter Carson and two security guards, were indicted on charges of restraining a woman. On November 9, 2006, the four were acquitted. In another episode, Greco was detained at the scene of a bachelor party while helping a man confront his cheating fiancée. After Greco explained the situation about the couple to police, he was given a short talk about disturbing the peace and released with a written warning.

On November 3, 2009, &quot;Inside Edition&quot; reiterated the claim that the show was staged, citing several more actors who said they were paid to appear. One of them appeared in the Greco stabbing episode and claimed it was staged. Despite the depiction of a male being placed under arrest for stabbing Greco, &quot;Inside Edition&quot; found that no actual arrest matching that description was made by the Rowlett, Texas police department, where the episode took place. The ambulance shown, along with the EMS personnel appeared to be from &quot;Greater Dallas EMS&quot;. Greater Dallas EMS was a private transfer ambulance in the Dallas area but would have never been dispatched for a 911 emergency. They are now out of business after being raided by the FBI in an investigation known as Operation Easy Rider. Physician–patient privilege would prevent the hospital that treated Greco from releasing records to &quot;Inside Edition&quot;. Nothing prevents the producers of &quot;Cheaters&quot; from voluntarily displaying the records, yet they have not done so. Despite the lack of records, Goldstein denied in an interview that the episode was staged. In a follow-up, aired on &quot;Inside Edition&quot; the following week (November 9, 2009), Greco was interviewed by investigative reporter Matt Meagher about the previous week&#x27;s accusations. Greco declined to respond, claiming that he could not legally do so.

On August 8, 2010, an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission press release reported that Bobby Goldstein Productions, Inc., and Cheaters II, Ltd. (Civil Action No. 3:08-CV-1912-P) paid $50,000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit. The suit was brought on the behalf of two female office assistants who were the target of frequent sexual jokes and comments, unwanted physical advances, and propositions for sex. The alleged perpetrators included members of upper management. Says attorney Robert A. Canino, a regional attorney from the EEOC Dallas District Office, &quot;just because the creator of &quot;Cheaters&quot; promotes a TV show business which thrives on featuring sexual transgressions, it is no justification for engaging in sexual improprieties which violate the employment rights of his female employees behind the scenes.&quot;

== Merchandise ==
Visual Entertainment of Canada has released several best-of collections of &quot;Cheaters&quot; on DVD in Region 1. In addition the Cheaters Spy Shop was launched in September 2011 to sell items used on the show and has been promoted in episodes beginning in the Season 12. &quot;Cheaters&quot; DVD releases are uncensored, with language and sexual content (including occasional views of acts such as fellatio and penetration) shown unfiltered.

== References in pop culture ==

The show has been parodied and referenced in several films and television shows, such as &quot;Janky Promoters&quot; (2009), &quot;George Lopez&quot;, &quot;Disturbia&quot; (2007), &quot;Sex Drive&quot; (2008), &quot;Just Go With It&quot; (2011), &quot;Mind of Mencia&quot;, &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;Talkshow with Spike Feresten&quot;, &quot;Workaholics&quot;, &quot;Unhitched&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;.

In the 2020 song, &quot;Need It&quot;, by Migos ft. NBA Youngboy from the former&#x27;s &quot;Culture III&quot;, Migos member Offset sings during the chorus: &quot;Then I leave her, I can’t get caught up, I can’t be on &quot;Cheaters&quot;&quot;.

In the song, &quot;Hats Off&quot; by Lil Baby &amp; Lil Durk (off their collaborative project, &quot;The Voice of the Heroes,&quot; released in 2021), featured artist on the track, Travis Scott, raps during his verse: &quot;Sorry, gotta fuck on the low, I can&#x27;t make &quot;Cheaters&quot;.&quot; Scott was accused of cheating during his high-profile relationship with model/socialite Kylie Jenner.

<text>ATS (Automobili Turismo e Sport) is an Italian automotive constructor. It once had a racing team that operated between 1963 and 1965, formed after the famous &quot;Palace Revolution&quot; at Ferrari.

==Production history==
The company was formed by Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini, among others – intending for it to be a direct competitor to Ferrari both on the race track and on the street. Chiti and Bizzarrini built, with sponsorship from the Scuderia Serenissima&#x27;s Count Giovanni Volpi, a road-going sports car and a Formula One racing car. It was presented in April 1963 at the Geneva Motor Show.


The sports car was the ATS 2500 GT, a small coupé developed by Chiti and Bizzarrini with a Franco Scaglione-designed bodywork built by Allemano. The engine was a mid-mounted 2.5 L V8 engineered by Chiti, capable of achieving 245 hp (180 kW) and accelerating to 257 km/h (160 mph). Only 12 cars were reportedly built, and few exist today. Apart from being the second mid-engine sports cars (the René-Bonnet / Matra Djet was presented five months earlier at the Salon de l&#x27;Autombile in Paris, France), the 2500 GT never gained fame or popularity, but its 90 degree DOHC V8 with a flatplane crankshaft was later developed into Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 engine in 2 L, 2.5 L and 3 L formats by Carlo Chiti at Autodelta.

==Racing history==
Construction of a Formula One car, the Tipo 100, began in mid-1962 on a farm near Bologna, with the car being unveiled in that city in December 1962. The Tipo 100 had a pencil thin body, and was powered by a V8 1,494cc engine, which featured fuel injection and double-overhead camshafts. The transmission was a 6-speed Colotti gearbox. Suspension consisted of rocker arms with inboard coils for the front, and double wishbones with coils for the rear, while disc brakes were mounted inboard. Total weight was just over 1,000 pounds. The cars were to be driven by Phil Hill and Giancarlo Baghetti, who had both left Ferrari after a disappointing 1962 season. Motorcycle racer Mike Hailwood test-drove in February 1963.

Testing took place at Monza, but this was slow and tedious, as when something broke, the car had to be taken back to Bologna for repairs, and then taken back to Monza for further testing. One of the major problems was chassis flexing, which was fixed by the unusual method of reinforcing tubes being welded over the top of the engine. The car was entered for several non-Championship races early in the season, but was withdrawn, due to not being ready. A similar situation occurred for the Monaco Grand Prix, before the cars made their first appearance, at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Spectators, officials and fellow competitors were shocked by the Tipo 100&#x27;s appearance. After looking so fantastic at the public unveiling back in Bologna, they now had rumpled body panels, pock marks and were poorly painted. The cars were oily and greasy, the body panels were ill-fitting. Due to the reinforcing tubes being over the top of the engine, they had to be sawed apart for an engine change, and then welded back into place. A new higher engine cover had been hurriedly fabricated to hide the tubes.

Both cars retired, as was the case with in the Dutch Grand Prix. The team did not attend the French, British and German races. The Tipo 100 returned for the Italian Grand Prix, and both cars started and finished, although a long way down the field – Hill 11th and Baghetti 15th. That was the only race where an ATS was classified as a finisher, with both cars retiring in the United States Grand Prix and Mexican Grand Prix, which marked the end of A.T.S as a Formula 1 team.

The ATS would later be used in the Derrington-Francis project spearheaded by the Rob Walker Racing Team&#x27;s former chief mechanic, Alf Francis. The car made one appearance at a Formula 1 race, the 1964 Italian Grand Prix, driven Mário de Araújo Cabral, where it retired after 25 laps. This car was subsequently restored in the late 1990s, and has appeared in historic racing meetings since then.

Count Volpi subsequently backed the Serenissima marque which used much technology similar to ATS. Bruce McLaren used a Serenissima engine for a few Grands Prix in 1966.

==Post-bankruptcy revival==

After the demise of ATS, Bizzarrini moved to Lamborghini before building his own cars as Bizzarrini, while Chiti founded Autodelta together with fellow ex-Ferrari engineer Lodovico Chizzola, which would work closely with Alfa Romeo for the following decades.

In 2017, ATS introduced the GT, which uses McLaren&#x27;s 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine, as seen on McLaren&#x27;s new models. ATS has planned production of 12 cars.

ATS revealed their sister brand, ATS Corsa, but not much is known. Their only produced car is the Corsa RRTurbo. The car is in &quot;Asphalt Legends Unite&quot; as a C-class car.

<text>Salvia&quot; subgenus &quot;Perovskia is a group of species within the flowering plant genus &quot;Salvia&quot;, which prior 2017 were treated as the separate genus &quot;Perovskia&quot;. Members of the group are native to southwestern and central Asia. It includes the garden plant Russian sage (&quot;Salvia × floriferior&quot;).

The subgenus and former genus are named after the Russian general V. A. Perovski (1794-1857).

;Species
# &quot;Salvia abrotanoides&quot; – Tibet, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, western Himalayas of northern India
# &quot;Salvia bungei&quot; , formerly &quot;Perovskia virgata&quot; – Tajikistan
# &quot;Salvia karelinii&quot; , formerly &quot;Perovskia angustifolia&quot; – Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan
# &quot;Salvia klokovii&quot; , formerly &quot;Perovskia linczevskii&quot; – Tajikistan
# &quot;Salvia kudrjaschevii&quot; ( – Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan
# &quot;Salvia pobedimovae&quot; , formerly &quot;Perovskia botschantzevii&quot; – Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan
# &quot;Salvia scrophulariifolia&quot; – Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan
# &quot;Salvia yangii&quot; – Afghanistan, Pakistan, western Himalayas, Tibet, Xinjiang

;Hybrids
# &quot;Salvia × floriferior&quot; – so-called &quot;Russian sage&quot;, also referred to as &quot;Perovskia × hybrida&quot; (unplaced taxon) and its synonym &quot;Perovskia × superba&quot; in Europe and Russia: (&quot;S. abrotanoides × S. yangii&quot;)
# &quot;Perovskia × intermedia&quot; – Kyrgyzstan: (&quot;S. abrotanoides × S. karelinii&quot;)

==Cultivation==
Plants in cultivation are almost all hybrids, including &quot;Salvia&quot; &#x27;Blue Spire&#x27;, which is very likely &quot;Salvia × floriferior&quot;, a naturally occurring hybrid between the entire-leaved &quot;Salvia yangii&quot; and &quot;Salvia abrotanoides&quot;. The leaves of this breed have long narrow teeth (i.e. are laciniate), unlike &quot;S. yangii&quot; which has entire leaves with shallow teeth.

<text>The  was a Swedish automobile manufactured from 1910 to 1911.

 began by importing an American Holsman high wheeler and using it as a pattern. The car used a flat-twin engine; its top speed was about . Some of the later engines had four cylinders. The gearbox was two-speed, and the entire engine was slid backwards under the frame to engage reverse. 35 cars were planned, of which 12 were built, the rest converted for use in railway inspection.

<text>Domab (, also Romanized as Domāb; also known as Dumāb) is a village in Eshen Rural District, Mehrdasht District, Najafabad County, Isfahan Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 773, in 198 families.

Domab is located between the three cities of Khvansar, Najafabad and Golpayegan. Domab is approximately 2140 meters above sea level. Located on the southern slope of Dalan mountain, Domab is irrigated via seasonal rivers. Choghagodar is also nearby.

The village contains a museum with 200 artifacts, a library, computer center and film center. There is also a cultural house in the village.

== History ==

Domab was referred to as &quot;Sabz Darreh Morad Abad&quot; in ancient documents. In those times, the settlement of Moradabad was most likely the nearest settlement to the Domab area. The cleaning of the Domab aqueduct led to the discovery of a stone lamp with &quot;Ostad Sha’Ban 1112&quot; engraved on it.

It is assumed that Domab became a permanent settlement between the years 1100 and 1150 A.D. The founders of the village are thought to be two brothers, named Moheb and Saleh, who began the families of Mohebian and Salehian. The farm at Domab and its surrounding region were at first rented from Dehagh.

After World War II, inflation became a problem in the region, and quarrels broke out between Domab and neighboring settlements of Eshen, Rahmatabad, and Khundab. There was also agricultural rioting, recorded in the village historical register.

Haj Hassan Domabi, said to be the son of Moheb, led the settlers of Domab to purchase the land from Dehagh. They registered the settlement as a village in the division of Isfahan.

Haj Hassan implemented the construction of foundation plans for the settlement, a local bath, and a mosque. Eventually, for the establishment of security in the region, a large castle was constructed, presumed to be the largest castle in the region. Although smaller castles had existed prior to this one, the new castle provided additional security against highwaymen and plunderers.

A few decades after this, there were internal problems in the village, due to arguments between the Mirzabi tribe and the Mohebi tribe. Externally, there were issues too; the main reasons for &quot;these&quot; arguments were economic, but also social issues as well. Lack of water and ownership rights on land contributed to these problems, but on these issues, the Mirzabi and the Mohebi banded together to defend the village.

<text>Karl-Hermann Flach (October 17, 1929 – August 25, 1973) was a German journalist of the &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot; and a politician of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP).

Flach was born in Königsberg. He became a member of the liberal LDP (in the Soviet zone of Germany) and worked in 1948/1949 for the LDP newspaper &quot;Norddeutsche Zeitung&quot; in Schwerin. In October 1949 he fled to West Berlin and became a member of the FDP. In 1949–1953 he studied political science at the German School of Politics, which is now the Otto Suhr Institute.

In 1956 he started to work for the federal headquarters of the party and had important campaign jobs in 1957 and 1961. But in 1962 he left the party organisation for the &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot;, a leading newspaper then considered liberal. From 1971 on he worked again for the FDP, this time as secretary-general of chairman Walter Scheel. Being elected to the Bundestag in 1972 he became vice chairman of the Bundestag party.

Flach died prematurely in Frankfurt, aged 43, in 1973 after having suffered a stroke a month before.

Flach belonged to the left wing of his party and is considered an important contributor to social liberalism. He was one of the authors of the left liberal Freiburger Thesen, a programmatic paper the party accepted at its congress in October 1971. The stand for the turn to the left the party started in 1968 to become more independent from the conservatives and have a coalition with the social democrats (1969–1982).

He has been honoured with several prizes for his work as a journalist. Later came a foundation and a prize named after him.

<text>The TC1000 is a 10.4&quot; laplet designed by Compaq, before it was purchased by HP. It used the Transmeta Crusoe processor. Unlike many other tablet PCs of its time (which can only operate either in a traditional laptop configuration, or with the keyboard folded behind the screen), the display is fully detachable from the keyboard. The product was developed and manufactured using ODM model from LG Electronics, Inc. of South Korea.

The TC1000 was replaced by the HP Compaq TC1100 which features a faster Pentium M processor and an integrated digitizer from Wacom (the TC1000 used a Finepoint digitizer which required a AAAA battery and lacked pressure-input, being binary on/off only), among other small upgrades.

The TC1000 comes with Windows XP Tablet PC Edition but it is capable of running Linux.

A restore CD is available on the Internet Archive to restore the machine to its factory configuration.

==Design Awards==
The TC1000 has won numerous industrial design awards. These include:
*2003 IDEA Bronze Award
*2003 IF Product Design Award
*2003 ID Magazine Honorable Mention (http://www.idonline.com/)
*2003 Good Design Award

The institute also maintains several analytical facilities in applied geophysics as well as a park of a variety of geophysical instruments.

IPGP maintains three campuses in the Paris area. Until 2010, its main headquarters location is inside the Jussieu Campus in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. After 2010, it moved into a state of the art dedicated facility adjacent to the Jussieu Campus, in front of the Jardin des Plantes. IPGP has a second campus located in Paris-Diderot University in the 13th arrondissement of Paris where the geodesy and space sciences research, and undergrad teaching are done. The third campus is located 6 km to the east of Paris where it conducts space and planetary science activities ranging from building geophysical space instruments and sensors to planetary data analysis. IPGP maintain a staff of nearly 500 persons.

The lead investigator (P.I.) for the seismometer instrument on the international space mission to Mars, InSight (launched 2018) is from this institute. Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) is a seismometer intended to operate on the surface of the planet Mars, hopefully increasing understanding of that planet and in turn the solar system and Earth interiors.

<text>A sonatina (French: “sonatine”, German: “Sonatine&quot;) is a small sonata. As a musical term, &quot;sonatina&quot; has no single strict definition; it is rather a title applied by the composer to a piece that is in basic sonata form, but is shorter and lighter in character, or technically more elementary, than a typical sonata. The term has been in use at least since the late baroque; there is a one-page, one-movement harpsichord piece by Handel called &quot;Sonatina&quot;. It is most often applied to solo keyboard works, but a number of composers have written sonatinas for violin and piano (see list under violin sonata), for example the Sonatina in G major for Violin and Piano by Antonín Dvořák, and occasionally for other instruments, for example the Clarinet Sonatina by Malcolm Arnold.

== Term ==

The title &quot;Sonatina&quot; was used occasionally by J. S. Bach for short orchestral introductions to large vocal works, as in his cantata &quot;Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit&quot;, BWV 106, a practice with precedent in the work of the earlier German composer Nicolaus Bruhns. This is the only sense in which Bach used the term sonatina, although he composed many chamber and solo sonatas for various instruments.

As with many musical terms, &quot;sonatina&quot; is used inconsistently. The most common meaning is a short, easy sonata suitable for students, such as the piano sonatinas of Clementi. However, by no means are all sonatinas technically undemanding, for example the virtuoso sonatinas of Busoni and Alkan, and the &quot;Sonatine&quot; of Ravel, whose title reflects its neo-classical quality. On the other hand, some sonatas could equally have been called sonatinas: for example Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 49, titled by the composer &quot;Zwei Leichte Sonaten für das Pianoforte&quot; (&quot;Two Easy Sonatas for Piano&quot;) comprise only two short movements each, a sonata-allegro and a short rondo (No. 1) or minuet (No. 2), all well within the grasp of the intermediate student. However, other works titled &quot;Sonatina&quot;, such as the Sonatinas in G and in F major, have been attributed to Beethoven.

== Form ==
In general, a sonatina will have one or more of the following characteristics: brevity; fewer movements than the four of the late classical sonata; technical simplicity; a lighter, less serious character; and (in post-romantic music) a neo-classical style or a reference to earlier music. Muzio Clementi&#x27;s sonatinas op. 36 are very popular among students.

The first (or only) movement is generally in an abbreviated sonata form, with little or no development of the themes. For this reason, a sonatina is sometimes defined, especially in British usage, as a short piece in sonata form in which the development section is quite perfunctory or entirely absent: the exposition is followed immediately by a brief bridge passage to modulate back to the home key for the recapitulation. Subsequent movements (at most two) may be in any of the common forms, such as a minuet or scherzo, a slow theme-and-variations, or a rondo.

<text>Dirk Verhofstadt (born 25 August 1955 in Dendermonde) is a Belgian social liberal (Rawlsian) theorist and younger brother of former Belgian Prime Minister and former ALDE European Parliament Leader Guy Verhofstadt. He has a keen interest in political philosophy, and his philosophical outlook is influenced by Karl Popper, John Stuart Mill, Cesare Beccaria, Thomas Paine, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum.

==Education==
He graduated in law and press- and communication sciences, and obtained a PhD in moral philosophy at the University of Ghent. He was professor &quot;Media and ethics&quot; at the University of Ghent until 2020.

On 1 July 2010 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Moral Science at the University of Ghent with his doctoral dissertation &quot;Pius XII and the extermination of the Jews. A moral and historical research into the moral responsibility of Pope Pius XII regarding the Final Solution to the Jewish Question.&quot;

==Think tank==
He is a member of Liberales, an independent think tank within the liberal movement. Its members consider liberalism as a progressive movement supporting individual freedom, justice and human rights. Liberales reacts against what it calls &quot;narrow minded conservatism&quot; related to social economic, ecological and ethical issues supported by &quot;compartmentalized&quot; parties and structures.

==Writings==
With his book &quot;Het menselijk liberalisme&quot; (Human Liberalism), he inspires politicians in Belgian liberal parties as well as in the Dutch parties Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie and Democraten 66. He defends liberalism against attacks by anti-globalists, by stating that liberalism implies/should imply and that green politics is not contradictory to liberalism. He wrote the books &quot;Pleidooi voor het individualisme&quot; (A Plea for Individualism) and &quot;De derde feministische golf&quot; (The Third Feminist Wave), much of it focusing on Islamic feminism and its impact in Europe. This book contains exclusive interviews with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Irshad Manji, Naima El Bezaz, , and Yasmine Allas.

On 26 September 2008, he released his new book &quot;Pius XII and the extermination of the Jews&quot; in the Dutch language. In this book, he examines the position of Pacelli, the later Pius XII, towards Adolf Hitler’s seizure of power, the downfall of the Catholic Zentrumspartei, the Reichskonkordat between Nazi-Germany and the Vatican, the encyclical &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (With Burning Concern), paganism, the Nazist education programs, the ‘T4-program’ (the murder of physically and mentally handicapped persons), the invasion of Poland, Operation Barbarossa, the Jews in the Netherlands, priest-president Jozef Tiso of Slovakia, the Ustasha in Independent State of Croatia, the deportation of Jews from Rome, the Hungarian Holocaust, the help offered to war criminals, the resistance against Nazism, the alleged refusal of the Church to &quot;give back Jewish&quot; children who had been in hiding, the failures of the Allies, alleged antisemitism after the Holocaust, and the moral question of alleged guilt of the Church and the pope.

In November 2019 he published the book &quot;Ide Leib Kartuz. Tailor in Auschwitz&quot; with David Van Turnhout as co-author. In July 2022 the English version &quot;A Tailor in Auschwitz&quot; was published by Pen &amp; Sword Books. In 2021 he published the book &quot;Chef in IG-Auschwitz&quot; with Anne Van Paemel as co-author. In 2022 he wrote the book &quot;Diary 1933&quot; about the danger of the extreme right emerging worldwide. In 2024 he published the book &quot;KZ syndrome. A scar that never goes away&quot; with Henri Heimans as co-author, about two people who survived the concentration camps Ravensbrück, Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Ebensee.

<text>Juan Carlos Zabala (October 11, 1911 – January 24, 1983), also known as &quot;El [[Ñandú]] Criollo&quot;, was an Argentine long-distance runner, who won the marathon at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Zabala ran his first marathon at the end of October 1931. Ten days after that he set a new world record in the 30 km (1:42:30.4). Later, before the 1936 Summer Olympics, Zabala would run a new world record in the 20 km (1:04:00.2).

Zabala&#x27;s peak was the 1932 Olympic marathon race. He ran in the lead group almost the entire distance. With just four kilometres left, he broke free to finish 20 seconds ahead of Sam Ferris from Great Britain. Zabala also participated at the 1936 Summer Olympics, placing sixth over 10,000 m, but could not defend his Olympic title in the marathon. Zabala took the lead from the start, but tripped and fell at 28 km, and abandoned the race after 33 km when the main group caught him.

Zabala was the flag bearer for Argentina at the opening ceremony of the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1983 he was named as Argentina&#x27;s track and field athlete of the century.

<doc id="858288" wikidata="Q13405084" url="?curid=858288" title="Chinese head tax">
<text>The Chinese head tax was a fixed fee charged to every Chinese person entering Canada. The head tax was first levied after the Canadian parliament passed the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; of 1885 and it was meant to discourage Chinese people from entering Canada after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The tax was abolished by the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; of 1923, which outright prevented all Chinese immigration except for that of business people, clergy, educators, students, and some others.

==Tax==
Through the mid- to late 19th century, some 17000 labourers were brought from China to do construction work on the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), though they were paid a third or a half less than their co-workers (about CA$1/day). Once the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed, the demand for cheap labour was non-existent, so the provincial legislature of British Columbia passed a strict law to virtually prevent Chinese immigration in 1885. However, this was immediately struck down by the courts as &quot;ultra vires&quot; (&quot;beyond the powers&quot;) of the provincial legislative assembly, as it impinged upon federal jurisdiction over immigration into Canada. A similar attempt had been made a year before, and another one was made in 1878 to tax every Chinese over the age of 12 the sum of taxed $10 () every three months.

Responding to the anti-immigration sentiment in British Columbia, the Canadian government of John A. Macdonald introduced the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot;, which became law in 1885. Under its regulations, the law stipulated that all Chinese people entering Canada must first pay a fee, later referred to as a head tax. This was amended in 1887, 1892, and 1900, with the fee increasing to in 1900 and later to its maximum of in 1903 (), representing a two-year salary of an immigrant worker at that time.

However, not all Chinese arrivals had to pay the head tax; those who were better off financially and presumed to return to China based on the apparent, transitory nature of their occupation or background were exempt from the penalty. These included arrivals identifying themselves as: students, teachers, missionaries, merchants, or members of the diplomatic corps.

The Government of Canada collected about CA$23 million ($ in dollars) in face value from about 81,000 head tax payers. The head tax did discourage Chinese women and children from joining their men, but it failed to meet its goal, articulated by contemporary politicians and labour leaders, of the complete exclusion of Chinese immigration. That was achieved through the same law that ended the head tax: the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act of 1923&quot;, which stopped Chinese immigration, but with certain exemptions for business owners and others. It is sometimes referred to by opponents as the &quot;Chinese Exclusion Act&quot;, a term also used for its American counterpart.

==Redress==
After the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; was repealed in 1948, various community leaders including Wong Foon Sien campaigned for the federal government to open immigration policies for the Chinese community.

However, the concept of a redress movement did not begin until 1984, when Vancouver Member of Parliament (MP) Margaret Mitchell raised the issue of repaying the Chinese Head Tax for two of her constituents in the House of Commons of Canada after the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been proclaimed and entrenched in the Constitution Act, 1982. 

Over 4,000 other head tax payers and their family members were eventually registered by the Chinese Canadian National Council (CCNC) and its member organizations across Canada, after the issue gathered broad public attention on the CJVB radio program, &quot;Chinese Voice&quot;, hosted by Richmond, British Columbia, personality Hanson Lau in February 1984.

The redress campaign included holding community meetings, gathering support from other groups and prominent people, increasing the media profile, conducting research and published materials, making presentations at schools, etc.

In 1989, Chinese Canadian National Council, the longtime advocate for the head Tax redress, suffered a split after the Tiananmen Square Massacre, which saw the formation of a competing group, the National Congress of Chinese Canadians (NCCC).

===1990s: preliminary negotiations===

In 1993, Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney made an offer of individual medallions, a museum wing, and other collective measures that would also include several other redress-seeking communities. These were rejected outright by the Chinese Canadian national groups.

However, in the same year, after Jean Chrétien became prime minister, the newly elected Liberal government openly refused to provide an apology or redress at all with the Multiculturalism Minister Sheila Finestone announcing in a letter, the following year, that the government &quot;cannot rewrite history&quot; and would not grant financial compensation or redress to groups for past injustices. Instead, the letter reaffirmed $24 million in financing for a Canadian Race Relations Foundation, an idea raised by the previous Conservative government.

The CCNC and a number of regional groups across Canada continued to raise the issue whenever they could, including a submission to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and undertaking court action against the Crown-in-Council, arguing that the federal Crown should not be profiting from racism, and that it had a responsibility under the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and international human rights law.

===CA$1.2 billion legal challenge===

In a legal challenge led by the CCNC, it was argued that the apology and compensation for the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War, offered by the government in 1988, established a precedent for redressing other racially motivated policies. However, the Ontario court declared in its 2001 decision that the Government of Canada had no obligation to redress the head tax levied on Chinese immigrants because the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; had no retroactive application and the case of the internment of Japanese Canadians was not a legal precedent. Two subsequent appeals in 2002 and 2003 were also unsuccessful.

Following the legal setbacks, community activism resumed once again across the country. Several regional and national events had been organized to revitalize the redress campaign, including opening discussions with opposition parties, led by groups in Edmonton and Montreal, which later formed the Chinese Canadian Redress Alliance alongside the CCNC.

When Paul Martin won the leadership of the federal Liberal Party and became prime minister in 2003, there was a sense of urgency in the Chinese Canadian community as it became clear that there were perhaps only a few dozen surviving Chinese Head Tax payers left, along with potentially a few hundred spouses or widows.

===2004: recommendations and report of the United Nations rapporteur===

In 2004, Doudou Diène, the United Nations special rapporteur on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, concluded that Canada should redress the head tax to Chinese Canadians in response to a submission by May Chiu, legal counsel to the Chinese Canadian Redress Alliance. The Report&#x27;s recommendations once again drew national and international attention to the Chinese Canadian redress campaign. In 2005, Gim Wong, an 82-year-old son of two head tax payers and a World War II veteran, conducted a cross-country Ride for Redress on his Honda Gold Wing motorcycle, whereupon his arrival in Ottawa Prime Minister Paul Martin refused to meet him.

===2005: failed Bill C-333===

On November 17, 2005, the National Congress of Chinese Canadians (NCCC) announced in a turn of events that an agreement had been reached between 11 of its member Chinese-Canadian groups and the federal Cabinet, wherein the Queen-in-Council would pay CA$12.5 million for the creation of a new non-profit foundation to educate Canadians about anti-Chinese discrimination, but with a specific pre-condition that no apology would be expected from the government.

The NCCC was formed on a platform of &quot;no apology and no individual compensation,&quot; and was seen by many as the reason the Liberal government selected them as the representative group to negotiate the deal without any prior consultation with the Chinese Canadian community at large.

The Department of Canadian Heritage announced on November 24, 2005 that the agreed upon funding would be reduced to $2.5 million. It was later revealed that the Minister for Asia and Pacific Affairs, Raymond Chan, who claimed to have negotiated the deal, purposely misled both the ministers of the Crown and the public. Some of the groups named in the agreement later stated publicly that their names had been used without permission and in other cases, several other groups listed did not even exist.

The surprise Liberal agreement caused a great outcry in the Chinese Canadian community, as the purported deal with the NCCC had been conducted without their input, resulting in an escalation in the redress movement, nationwide.

Bill C-333, the Chinese Canadian Recognition and Redress Act, a private member&#x27;s bill, was tabled in the federal parliament in order to implement the deal in November 2005. While C-333 purported to acknowledge, commemorate and educate about past government wrongdoings, it fell far short of the apology demanded by generations of Chinese Canadians. The Ontario Coalition of Head Tax Payers and Families lobbied the Conservative Party to stop the passage of Bill C-333. The Conservatives exercised a procedural prerogative and switched the order of Bill C-333 with Bill C-331, a bill to recognize past wrongs against Ukrainian Canadians during wartime, causing Bill C-333 to die when Prime Minister Martin&#x27;s Liberals lost a motion of non-confidence and parliament was dissolved on November 28, 2005.

===2006: federal campaign and election===
As they had done while campaigning for the federal election in 2004, the New Democratic Party and Bloc Québécois stated, during the leadup to the January 2006 election, their support for an apology and redress for the head tax. Similarly, on December 8, 2005, Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper released a press statement expressing his support for an apology for the head tax. As a part of his own party platform, Harper promised to work with the Chinese community on redress, should the Conservatives be called to form the next government. Before his party ultimately lost the election, Martin issued a personal apology on a Chinese language radio program. However, he was quickly criticized by the Chinese Canadian community for not issuing the apology in the House of Commons and for then trying to dismiss it completely in the English-speaking media on the very same day. Several Liberal candidates with significant Chinese-Canadian populations in their ridings, including Vancouver-Kingsway MP David Emerson and the Minister of State for Multiculturalism and Richmond MP Raymond Chan, also made futile attempts to change their positions in the midst of the campaign. Notably, Deputy Prime Minister and Edmonton Centre MP Anne McLellan lost her riding to Conservative MP Laurie Hawn.

===Apology===
The 2006 federal election was won by the Conservative Party, forming a minority government. Three days after the ballots had been counted on January 23, but before he had been appointed prime minister, Harper reiterated his position on the head tax issue in a news conference, that &quot;the Chinese Canadian community deserves an apology for the head tax and appropriate acknowledgement and redress.&quot;

Early discussions on the form of apology and redress began on March 24, 2006, with a preliminary meeting between Chinese Canadians representing various groups (including some head tax payers), Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister Jason Kenney, and Heritage Minister Bev Oda, resulting in the &quot;distinct possibility&quot; of an apology being issued before July 1, to commemorate the anniversary of the enacting of the &quot;Chinese Exclusion Act&quot; of 1923. The government&#x27;s acknowledgement followed in the Speech from the Throne delivered by Governor General Michaëlle Jean on April 4.

That year, from April 21 to 30, the Crown-in-Council hosted the first, formal public consultations across Canada in cities most actively involved and responsible for the campaign: Halifax, Vancouver, Toronto, Edmonton, Montreal, and Winnipeg. They included the personal testimony of elders and representatives from a number of groups, among them the Halifax Redress Committee; the British Columbia Coalition of Head Tax Payers, Spouses and Descendants; ACCESS; the Ontario Coalition of Head Tax Payers and Families; the CCNC; the Edmonton HTEA Redress Committee of the Chinese Canadian Redress Alliance; and, the Montreal chapter of the Chinese Canadian Redress Alliance.

A number of the leading groups demanded meaningful redress, not only for the handful of surviving &quot;head tax&quot; payers and their widows or spouses, but first-generation sons and daughters who were direct victims, as recounted in the documentary &quot;Lost Years: A People&#x27;s Struggle for Justice&quot;, proposing that the redress be represented (and limited) by each, actual &quot;head tax&quot; certificate brought forward by its surviving family members, or estate. Early demands from community groups for individual redress, ranged from $10,000 to $30,000 for the estimated 4,000 registrants.

On June 22, 2006, twenty-two years after the Chinese Canadian redress campaign began, Prime Minister Stephen Harper delivered an official apology to Chinese Canadians in the House of Commons for the first session of the 39th Parliament. During his address Harper spoke a few words in Cantonese, &quot;&quot; (, &#x27;Canada Apologizes&#x27;), breaking the parliamentary tradition of speaking either English and French in the House of Commons. 

To the disappointment of many in the Chinese Canadian community, it was announced that only original head tax payers, or their surviving spouses, then in their nineties, or a total 785 claimants, would receive CAD$20,000 in individual redress, representing less than a fraction of one-percent of the 81,000 original head tax payers. Only an estimated 20 Chinese Canadians who paid the tax were still alive in 2006.

As no mention of further redress was made, the Chinese Canadian community continued to fight for redress from the Canadian government. A national day of protest was held to coincide with Canada Day 2006 in major cities across Canada, and several hundred Chinese Canadians joined in local marches.

<doc id="858294" wikidata="Q4115067" url="?curid=858294" title="Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat">
<text>[[Nik family of Kelantan|Nik]] Abdul Aziz bin [[Nik family of Kelantan|Nik]] Mat (Jawi: ; 10 January 1931 – 12 February 2015) was a Malaysian politician and Muslim cleric. He was the Menteri Besar of Kelantan from 1990 to 2013 and the &quot;Mursyidul Am&quot; or Spiritual Leader of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) from 1991 until his death in 2015. Overall, his career as an elected politician lasted for some 48 years following his election to the Parliament of Malaysia in 1967.

Nik Aziz was notable for his racially progressive stances in contrast to other contemporary figures within PAS&#x27;s leadership that made it appeal to periphery non-Malay, non-Muslim electoral bases contributing to historic coalitions with left-leaning and multicultural parties like in Pakatan Rakyat; his death however led said leadership to purge like-minded progressives who splintered as the National Trust Party, as well shifting themselves further right towards Malay supremacism.

==Early life==
Nik Abdul Aziz was born in Kota Bharu in 1931 as the second of five siblings. He was raised by a single father (Tok Kura) who was an aspiring blacksmith. Nik Aziz&#x27;s Islamic studies began in &quot;pondok&quot; schools in Kelantan and Terengganu. He went on to study at Darul Uloom Deoband in Uttar Pradesh, India for five years. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in Arabic Studies and Master of Arts in Islamic jurisprudence from Al-Azhar University, Egypt. During his university studies, he was one of the witnesses and a civilian to have lived in the heat of the Arab-Israeli Conflict.

Having returned from Egypt, Nik Aziz worked as a teacher at various religious schools in Kelantan including his father&#x27;s pondok (religious school). Nik Aziz started to teach at various mosques and Pondok within Kelantan and other states. He became a respected Islamic scholar earning the nickname &quot;Tok Guru.&quot; (means &#x27;Master/sifu of Scholar or teacher&#x27; in Malay)

==Political career==
Nik Aziz joined PAS in 1967. He contested and won the Kelantan Hilir parliamentary seat by-election in that same year, and held the seat (later renamed Pengkalan Chepa) until 1986. In 1982, he was part of a movement by young members to bring change to the party leadership. PAS had lost the Kelantan state elections in 1978 and, as PAS state commissioner, Nik Aziz began to question president Asri Muda&#x27;s leadership. Finally, in the PAS &quot;Muktamar&quot; (General Assembly) that year, Asri was forced to resign.

After stepping aside from federal politics, Nik Aziz won a seat in the Kelantan State Assembly in the 1986 general elections. In 1990, PAS managed to wrest control of Kelantan back from Barisan Nasional. In his capacity as party leader in the state, Nik Aziz became Menteri Besar of Kelantan. He succeeded Yusof Rawa as spiritual leader of PAS in 1991.

Nik Aziz&#x27;s government was re-elected on four occasions (1995, 1999, 2004, 2008), until his retirement in 2013. During the 1990s, his administration in Kelantan frequently clashed on the role of Islam in Malaysia with the then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In contrast with the racially exclusive ruling party UMNO, he openly rejected communal politics.

Nik Aziz commanded support from a large number of non-Muslims in Malaysia and played a leading role during PAS&#x27; increase in popularity among non-Muslims.

In May 2013, Nik Aziz publicly stated that he did not consent on any co-operation between United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) as long as he was alive. However, in September 2019, when PAS and UMNO signed the formal charter of alliance, named Muafakat Nasional, PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang claimed that Nik Aziz had already consented to the cooperation while he was alive.

==Issues==

===Hardline views===
Nik Aziz drew some criticism for his hardline Islamic views. His advocacy of Islamic shariah law for all Malay Muslims drew criticism. According to Fox News, Nik Aziz suggested that women would be at a lower risk of being raped if they abandoned using their lipstick and perfume. He was also recorded once stating that fashionable and sexy-dressing women deserved to be raped during a speech.

===The &quot;Allah&quot; issue===
In 2012, there was an issue of Catholics in Malaysia using the Arabic term for &quot;God&quot;; &quot;Allah&quot; in their Christian Bible. Initially, Nik Aziz stated that the word &quot;Allah&quot; can be used by non-Muslims as the origin of the word itself is evidently pre-Islamic. The issue caused a stir in the Muslim community. The PAS party was almost divided into two blocs; one that supported the use of the word, and one that did not. Aiming to restore unity in PAS, Nik Aziz took back his words and disapproved of the word &quot;Allah&quot; being used by non-Muslims.

===Son detained under ISA===
His son Nik Adli was held under the Malaysian Internal Security Act in 2001 for alleged terrorist activities including planning jihad, possession of weapons, and membership in the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM), an Islamist extremist group. After 5 years in detention without trial, he was released.

==Retirement and death==
During the 2013 election, PAS once again won a majority of seats to form a Kelantan state government. Nik Aziz announced his retirement as Chief Minister of Kelantan, the post he held since 1990. His successor is Nik Aziz&#x27;s former deputy Chief Minister Ahmad Yaakob, who took over his office to replace him as Kelantan&#x27;s Chief Minister. Over the ensuing two years, Nik Aziz became increasingly ill with prostate cancer, and died on at 9.40 p.m. Malaysia Standard Time (UTC+08:00); at his residence in , Kota Bharu. The following day, more than 10,000 people attended his funeral at Masjid Tok Guru, his local mosque. His death triggered the Kelantan State Assembly seat of 2015 Chempaka by-election.

==Election results==

==Honours==
===Honours of Malaysia===
** Officer of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (KMN) (1974)
** Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (PSM) – Tan Sri (2023 – posthumously)

<text>The Jussieu Campus (&quot;Campus de Jussieu&quot;) or the Pierre-et-Marie-Curie Campus is a higher education campus located in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, France. It is the main campus of the Sorbonne Faculty of Science and Engineering. Paris Diderot University (now merged into Paris Cité University), was also originally located on the Jussieu campus, but moved to a new, independent campus, the Great Mills of Paris campus, in the new &quot;Paris Rive Gauche&quot; neighbourhood in 2006-2012.

== History ==

The campus was opened in 1951 and eventually, it would host a great part of the old faculty of sciences of the Sorbonne. The campus is built on the site of the former &quot;Halle aux Vins,&quot; a wine market created by Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1957, the first university buildings were built along the Eastern bank of the River Seine (le quai Saint-Bernard), and Rue Cuvier. In order to allow the wine market to remain on the site, the architects planned to construct the buildings on stilts above the roads of the market.

However, in 1964, with over 20,000 science students graduating high school (the baby boom generation), the old Sorbonne could not accommodate the influx of students. The Minister of Culture André Malraux entrusted architect Édouard Albert with the task of rapidly constructing a new science campus on the site. Albert&#x27;s grand vision of modular metallic buildings, designed to facilitate interdisciplinary work and improve teaching, was never achieved and was eventually abandoned in 1972.

== Facilities ==

Most of the campus consists in a regular grid of 6-floor wings; at the intersections are staircases and elevators. The grid is built above a large elevated slab; the buildings do not reach to the bottom of the slab, making it possible to walk across campus while remaining outdoors. Underneath the slab are ground-level and underground facilities, including a car park. The main front of Jussieu is bounded by a dry moat 10 meters deep; the main pedestrian entrance is a bridge over this moat that can be readily secured. The high-security features of the campus are likely a response to the student riots that occurred in 1968 in this neighbourhood.

The center of the campus is a skyscraper called Tour Zamansky, or Tour Jussieu, housing the university&#x27;s administrative offices. Its height is 24 floors or 90 meters.

Some of the campus&#x27; research libraries (in mathematics, for instance) are among the largest and with the widest selection of books in France. Campus restaurants are located in the northeast corner of the campus, many of which afford a pleasant view of the Seine River.

== Controversies and asbestos ==
The campus was often decried as an architectural failure. The hollow space under the building wings enables wind to build up its force, and thus the environment on the slab is unfriendly. Sound-proofing is very poor, with classes regularly having to briefly stop when someone flushes the toilet next door. The regular grid plan is confusing, and only long-time residents can move through without going back to the wind-blown ground level, since many corridors do not allow through-crossing (laboratories etc. have often chosen to lock their corridor for safety reasons). The campus had increasingly deteriorated since its construction, and its older tower stairwells and exteriors were covered in perpetual graffiti.

The most worrisome aspect of the Jussieu architecture was its extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant. Asbestos fibers are carcinogenic when inhaled. As a consequence, the use of asbestos in buildings is prohibited in France, but was not at the time when the campus was built. The risks are particularly acute for workers who maintain the building (drilling walls, for example). In addition, the fire retardation is not considered sufficient, so that its metal frames would collapse in a large fire. An ambitious clean-up program was begun in 1997 after some high-profile protests. The wings are stripped of all equipment, walls, etc., down to the naked concrete frame, and are then rebuilt using more modern materials. Many advocated the destruction of Jussieu when the asbestos problem was addressed. However, the campus is protected as an architectural type, and must be restored to its original condition.In 1996 Claude Allègre, a well known French politician and former scientist, opposed the removal of asbestos from the campus, describing it as harmless and dismissing concerns about it as a form of &quot;psychosis created by leftists&quot;. The campus&#x27; asbestos is deemed to have killed 22 people and caused serious health problems in 130 others.

The 1997–2016 refurbishment completely removed the asbestos. This was also an opportunity to rebuild the campus to be more friendly to its inhabitants. The graffiti were removed; sound proofing and thermal isolation was added; many of the round stairwells were replaced by straight ones; openings were made to create vistas and let in light; the prefabs were destroyed and replaced by gardens; courtyards were covered by transparent roofing; a dry garden was created around the Zamansky building; and a restaurant was opened in the South-East courtyard.

== Transportation ==
The campus is served by the Paris Métro station Jussieu with lines 7 and 10, as well as numerous bus lines (63, 67, 75, 86, 87, 89).

<text>Compuware Corporation was an American software company based in Detroit. The company offered products aimed at the information technology (IT) departments of large businesses, and its services also included testing, development, automation and performance management software for programs running on mainframe computer systems.

==History==

In 1973, Peter Karmanos Jr., Thomas Thewes, and Allen B. Cutting established Compuware Corporation to provide clients with professional technical services. By 1978, Compuware opened its first remote office to service the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore area. In 1992, the company completed its initial public offering (IPO) and traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol CPWR. At the end of 1998, Compuware surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark.

In 2003, Compuware moved their headquarters from Farmington Hills, Michigan, to a new headquarters building in downtown Detroit. In November 2014, the company&#x27;s headquarters building was sold to a joint venture of Dan Gilbert&#x27;s real estate group Bedrock Real Estate and Meridian Health for $142 million and renamed One Campus Martius. In December of that year, Compuware was acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo for approximately $2.5 billion, becoming a privately held company. In the years after that, the company experienced a period of growth and reinvention of mainframe software.

In March 2020, Compuware was acquired by BMC Software for $2 billion. Compuware ceased to exist as a company, but all of its products remain available under the name BMC Automated Mainframe Intelligence (BMC AMI). In October 2022, it was announced that BMC&#x27;s Detroit office will return to the northwest suburbs of Detroit, moving from One Campus Martius downtown to the Southfield Town Center in nearby Southfield.

<text>Salvia yangii, previously known as Perovskia atriplicifolia (), and commonly called Russian sage, is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant and subshrub. Although not previously a member of &quot;Salvia&quot;, the genus widely known as sage, since 2017 it has been included within them. It has an upright habit, typically reaching tall, with square stems and gray-green leaves that yield a distinctive odor when crushed. It is best known for its flowers. Its flowering season extends from mid-summer to late October, with blue to violet blossoms arranged into showy, branched panicles.

It is native to the steppes and hills of southwestern and central Asia. Successful over a wide range of climate and soil conditions, it has since become popular and widely planted. Several cultivars have been developed, differing primarily in leaf shape and overall height; &#x27;Blue Spire&#x27; is the most common. This variation has been widely used in gardens and landscaping. &quot;S. yangii&quot; was the Perennial Plant Association&#x27;s 1995 Plant of the Year, and the &#x27;Blue Spire&#x27; cultivar received the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society.

The species has a long history of use in traditional medicine in its native range, where it is employed as a treatment for a variety of ailments. This has led to the investigation of its phytochemistry. Its flowers can be eaten in salads or crushed for dyemaking, and the plant has been considered for potential use in the phytoremediation of contaminated soil.

==Description==

&quot;Salvia yangii&quot; is a deciduous perennial subshrub with an erect to spreading habit. Superficially, it resembles a much larger version of lavender. Multiple branches arise from a shared rootstalk, growing to a height of , with occasional specimens reaching . The mature plant may be across. The rigid stems are square in cross-section, and are covered by an indumentum formed by stellate, or star-shaped, trichomes and oil droplets. Especially during autumn, these hairs give the stems a silvery appearance.

The grayish-green leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, and attached to the stems by a short petiole. They are generally long and wide, although narrower in some populations. The overall leaf shape is oblate, a rounded shape longer than it is wide, to lanceolate, shaped like the head of a lance. They are , with a deeply incised leaf margin that may be either wavy or sharp-toothed; even within a single community of &quot;S. yangii&quot;, there can be considerable variation in the details of leaf shape. Leaves near the top of branches may merge into bracts. The foliage is aromatic, especially when crushed, with a fragrance described as sage-like, a blend of sage and lavender, or like turpentine.

The flowering season of &quot;S. yangii&quot; can be as long as June through October, although populations in some parts of its range, such as China, may bloom in a much more restricted period. The inflorescence is a showy panicle, , with many branches. Each of these branches is a raceme, with the individual flowers arranged in pairs called s. Each flower&#x27;s calyx is purple, densely covered in white or purple hairs, and about long. The corolla is tube-shaped, formed from a four-lobed upper lip and a slightly shorter lower lip; the blue or violet blue petals are about 1 cm long. The style has been reported in both an —extending beyond the flower&#x27;s tube—form and one contained within the flower; all known examples of &quot;S. yangii&quot; in cultivation have exserted styles. Gardening author Neil Soderstrom describes the appearance of the flowers from a distance as &quot;like a fine haze or fog&quot;.

The fruits develop about a month after flowering, and consist of dark brown oval nutlets, about .

===Phytochemistry===
The phytochemistry of Russian sage is under basic research. Analysis of its essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and their relative prevalence have not been consistent. Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, eucalyptol, limonene, γ-terpinene, and (+)-β-thujone, although the essential oil of a sample from the Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, &quot;trans&quot;-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols—borneol, cedrol, and menthol—have been extracted, as have caffeic acid and ferulic acid. More complex compounds have been isolated, some of which were first identified in this manner, including perovskatone; the glycosides atriplisides A and B; and atricins A and B, a pair of triterpenes that are similar to oleanane. Four diterpene glucosides have been isolated by extraction.

===Similar species===
Nine species are recognised within &quot;Salvia&quot; subg. &quot;Perovskia&quot;. &quot;S. abrotanoides&quot; shares much of the range of &quot;S. yangii&quot;, but is distinguished by its bipinnate leaves. Hybrids between these two species may occur naturally. Restricted to Turkestan in its native range, &quot;P. scrophularifolia&quot; is less upright; some forms have white flowers. The flowers of &quot;P. scabiosifolia&quot; are yellow.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Salvia yangii&quot; was described, under the name &quot;Perovskia atriplicifolia&quot;, by George Bentham in 1848, based on a specimen collected by William Griffith in Afghanistan, now preserved at the Kew Gardens herbarium as the species&#x27;s holotype. The specific epithet &quot;atriplicifolia&quot; means &quot;with leaves like &quot;Atriplex&quot;&quot;, referring to its similarity to saltbush. While commonly known as Russian sage, &quot;S. yangii&quot; is not native to Russia.

A population collected in Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County, Kashgar Prefecture, Xinjiang, China was described as a separate species in 1987 and given the name &quot;Perovskia pamirica&quot;, but was later considered synonymous with &quot;P. atriplicifolia&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;P. atriplicifolia&quot; was transferred to the genus &quot;Salvia&quot;. The combinations &quot;Salvia atriplicifolia&quot; and &quot;Salvia pamirica&quot;, however, have already been preoccupied by distinct taxa, thus new specific epithet &quot;yangii&quot;, honouring , one of the authors of &quot;P. pamirica&quot;, was given to the species.

===Phylogenetics===

Within the family Lamiaceae, the large genus &quot;Salvia&quot; had long been believed monophyletic, based on the structure of its stamens. Several smaller genera, including &quot;Dorystaechas&quot;, &quot;Perovskia&quot;, and &quot;Meriandra&quot; were also included in tribe Mentheae, but were thought to be more distantly related. In 2004, a molecular phylogenetics study based on two cpDNA genes (&quot;rbcL&quot; and &quot;trnL-F&quot;) demonstrated that &quot;Salvia&quot; is not monophyletic, but comprises three identifiable clades. Clade I is more closely related to &quot;Perovskia&quot; than to other members of &quot;Salvia&quot;.

&quot;S. yangii&quot; has been the subject of subsequent studies seeking to clarify the relationships within Mentheae. Further research combined palynological analysis of pollen grains with &quot;rbcL&quot; sequencing to provide additional support for the relationship between &quot;Perovskia&quot; and &quot;Salvia&quot; clade I. It also distinguished between &quot;S. yangii&quot; and &quot;S. abrotanoides&quot;, while confirming their close relationship. A subsequent multigene study (four cpDNA markers and two nrDNA markers) redrew parts of the Mentheae cladogram, making &quot;Rosmarinus&quot; a sister group to &quot;Perovskia&quot;.

===Cultivars===

Several cultivars of &quot;S. yangii&quot; have been developed. They are primarily distinguished by the height of mature plants and the depth of the leaf-margin incisions. Many of these cultivars, especially those with deeply incised leaves, may actually be hybrids of &quot;S. yangii&quot; and &quot;S. abrotanoides&quot;. In that context, some may be referred to by the hybrid name &quot;Perovskia&quot; ×&quot;hybrida&quot;.

The most common cultivar, &#x27;Blue Spire&#x27;, is among those suspected of being a hybrid. It was selected from German plantings by the British Notcutts Nurseries, and first exhibited in 1961. &#x27;Blue Spire&#x27; grows to approximately , and has large, darker blue flowers. In 1993, it received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

&#x27;Filigran&#x27; reaches a height of ; this tall, sturdy cultivar&#x27;s name is German for filigree, in reference to its lacy, fern-like foliage. &#x27;Little Spire&#x27; is shorter, with a mature height of only . &#x27;Longin&#x27; is similar in height to &#x27;Blue Spire&#x27; but more upright. Allan Armitage established the late-flowering cultivar &#x27;Mystery of Knightshayes&#x27; from a plant at Knightshayes Court. Other cultivars include &#x27;Blue Haze&#x27;, &#x27;Blue Mist&#x27;, &#x27;Hybrida&#x27; (also called &#x27;Superba&#x27;), &#x27;Lace&#x27;, &#x27;Lisslit&#x27;, &#x27;Rocketman&#x27;, and &#x27;WALPPB&#x27;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Widely distributed across Asia in its native range, &quot;S. yangii&quot; grows in western China, northwestern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and parts of eastern Europe. It is found in steppes and on hillsides, and grows at higher elevations in mountainous regions, including the Himalayas. It has been recorded at of altitude in the Karakoram. In Pakistan&#x27;s Quetta district, it is often found in association with the grass &quot;Chrysopogon aucheri&quot;, and may serve as an indicator species for soils with low calcium carbonate and chloride availability. The harsh habitats preferred by &quot;S. yangii&quot; are comparable to the sagebrush steppe of North America.

== Ecology ==
In parts of its range, such as the Harboi, these steppe ecosystems are employed as rangeland for grazing animals such as sheep and goats, although this forage is generally of poor nutritional quality. &quot;S. yangii&quot; can serve as an important source of phosphorus and zinc, despite being high in poorly-digested material such as neutral detergent fiber and lignin.

== Cultivation ==

Following its introduction to the United Kingdom in 1904, the Irish gardener and author William Robinson was immediately taken with the plant, which he described as being &quot;worth a place in the choicest garden for its graceful habit and long season of beauty.&quot; The Royal Horticultural Society records the establishment of cultivars beginning with &quot;P. &quot;&#x27;Hybrida&#x27;, selected at a Hampshire nursery in the 1930s. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;S. yangii&quot; had gained widespread popularity, and in 1995, it was selected as the Perennial Plant Association&#x27;s Plant of the Year.

The cultivar &#x27;Blue Spire &#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Planting and care===
Russian sage is a perennial plant suitable for a wide range of conditions, at least where its tendency to spread will not be a problem. The species prefers full sun. Specimens planted in partially shaded locations tend to spread or flop, although this behavior can be controlled somewhat by pinching young shoots or by providing a strong-standing accompaniment that the plant can drape itself around for support. Flowers bloom only on new growth. Plants trimmed to in early spring provide the best subsequent growth and flowering.

Tolerant of both heat and cold, it is grown in North America in United States Department of Agriculture hardiness zones three through nine, although some cultivars may be better suited than others to extremes of temperature. It is successfully grown from the southwestern United States, north and east across much of the country, and across the Canada–US border into Ontario and Quebec. In the coldest of these areas, it may require considerable protection to survive the winter. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Horticultural Society has assigned it hardiness rating H4, indicating that it tolerates temperatures as low as , hardy in most of the country through typical winters.

It also tolerates a variety of soil conditions. Although young specimens perform best when planted in a mixture of peat and either sand or perlite, &quot;S. yangii&quot; can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. &quot;S. yangii&quot; is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.

===Landscaping===

Russian sage has been praised for its usefulness in gardens and landscaping features. It is most commonly planted as an accent feature, such as an &quot;island&quot; in an expanse of lawn, but it can also be used as filler within a larger landscaping feature, or to enhance areas where the existing natural appearance is retained. Gardening author Troy Marden describes &quot;S. yangii&quot; as having a &quot;see-through&quot; quality that is ideal for borders. Some experts suggest groups of three plants provide the best landscape appearance. It is also suitable for container gardening. It does have an undesirable tendency to spread via rhizomes beyond it original planting.

It attracts bees, hummingbirds, and butterflies, and contributes color to gardens—both the blue of its late-season flowers, and the silvery colors of its winter stalks.

===Propagation===
Russian sage is frequently propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings are taken from shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, its relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.

Some members of the Lamiaceae can spread unchecked and become invasive plants. Planting of Russian sage near wild lands has been discouraged by some gardening guides out of concern for its potential to spread, but it is not yet considered invasive, and has been suggested as a substitute for purple loosestrife for this reason.

==Uses==

Russian sage has a long history of use in traditional medicine, and is smoked as a euphoriant.

In addition to its use in folk medicine, it is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads.

 This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.

The essential oil can function as a biopesticide, especially regarding &quot;Tropidion castaneum&quot; beetles and &quot;Camponotus maculatus&quot; carpenter ants.

<doc id="858307" wikidata="Q6414680" url="?curid=858307" title="Kipper (medieval tournament)">
<text>In medieval tournaments a kipper was a person employed by a knight, usually a vassal of the knight such as a slave, serf, or peasant. Kippers might also be fighters of non-knightly status, who therefore did not fight on horseback. 

The function of the kipper was to follow his knight in combat and retrieve armour or arms from fallen adversaries. If the adversary was not completely subdued and ready to surrender these, the kipper would bang on the armour-clad opponent with various blunt non-lethal instruments, like heavy sticks or clubs, to knock him unconscious for the purpose of gathering the spoils without further protest. 

It was the right of a knight to seize the armour and weapons of a fallen adversary during a tournament. In the early days, tournament fighting was not much different from open warfare, with few rules and none of the pomp and ceremony of the later tournaments. In this chaotic mêlée, kippers were therefore mere foot soldiers of the tournament, and it was not their function or intention to participate in the fighting. 

In the later Middle Ages, when tournaments no longer resembled actual warfare and the chivalric code became more popular, kippers were frowned upon. Less warlike and more honorable tournament conduct was encouraged.

The word &quot;kipper&quot; is cognate with Icelandic kippa (&quot;to pull, snatch&quot;), Danish kippen (&quot;to seize&quot;), and a Middle High German word that means &quot;to beat or kick&quot;.

<doc id="858314" wikidata="Q1778725" url="?curid=858314" title="Vehicle Excise Duty">
<text>Vehicle Excise Duty (VED; also known as &quot;vehicle tax&quot;, &quot;car tax&quot;, and &quot;road tax&quot;, and formerly as a &quot;tax disc&quot;) is an annual tax levied as an excise duty, and which must be paid for most types of powered vehicles which are to be used or parked on public roads in the United Kingdom. Registered vehicles that are not being used or parked on public roads and which have been taxed since 31 January 1998 must be covered by a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) to avoid VED. In 2016, VED generated approximately £6 billion for the Exchequer.

A vehicle tax was first introduced in Britain in 1888. In 1920, an excise duty was introduced that specifically applied to motor vehicles; initially it was hypothecated (ring-fenced or earmarked) for road construction and paid directly into a special Road Fund. After 1937, this reservation of vehicle revenue for roads was ended, and instead the revenue was paid into the Consolidated Fund – the general pot of money held by government. Since then, maintenance of the UK road network has been funded out of general taxation, of which VED is a part.

==Current regulations==

VED across the United Kingdom is collected and enforced by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Until 2014, VED in Northern Ireland was collected by the Driver and Vehicle Agency there; responsibility has since been transferred to the DVLA.

The registered keeper of a vehicle that is liable for VED must pay the appropriate VED amount (which may be zero) to license the vehicle for road use. Owners of registered vehicles which have been licensed since 31 January 1998 and who do not now wish to use or store a vehicle on the public highway are not required to pay VED, but are required to submit an annual Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN). Failure to submit a SORN is punishable in the same manner as failure to pay duty when using the vehicle on public roads.

Until 1 October 2014 a vehicle licence (tax disc) had to be displayed on a vehicle (usually adhered inside the windscreen on the nearside, thus easily visible to officials patrolling roads on foot) as evidence of having paid the duty. Since that date, the circular paper discs have not been issued and there is no longer a requirement to display a disc as the records are now stored in a centralised database and accessible using the vehicle registration plate details.

===Cars===
There are three payment schedules in effect, depending on whether the car was first registered before or after 1 April 2017, or before 1 March 2001. Further changes will come into effect in April 2025, affecting new and existing electric vehicles.

====Registered before 1 March 2001====
For cars registered before 1 March 2001 the excise duty is based on engine size.

====Registered before 1 April 2017====

For vehicles registered between 1 March 2001 and 31 March 2017 charges are based on theoretical CO2 emission rates per kilometre. The price structure was revised from 1 April 2013 to introduce an alternative charge for the first year (the standard cost was not changed, and remained the same as for 2001 onwards). The &quot;first year rate&quot; only applies in the year the vehicle was first registered and is said by the government to be designed to send &quot;a stronger signal to the buyer about the environmental implications of their car purchase&quot;.

Alternative fuel cars (TC59) all warrant a £10 discount from the below, except when zero-rated. Charges as applicable from 1 April 2024:

====Registered after 1 April 2017====
The biggest changes from April 2017 are that hybrid vehicles are no longer rated at £0, and that cars with a retail price of £40,000 and over pay a supplement for years 2 to 6.

For cars with a &quot;list price&quot; over £40,000 an additional amount – the &#x27;expensive car supplement&#x27; – is paid at the first five annual renewals, i.e. in years 2 to 6 of the vehicle&#x27;s life. In this supplement was increased to £355. At first the supplement applied to all types of car, but the 2020 Budget provided an exemption for zero-emission vehicles (both new and existing), effective from 1 April 2020.

====Changes on 1 April 2025====
In November 2022, the UK government announced that reduced tax rates for zero-emission vehicles would cease on 1 April 2025, making rates the same as for those with internal combustion engines. The changes affect new and existing vehicles as follows:

* Zero-emission cars first registered on or after 1 April 2017 will pay the 1–50g/km rate in their first year of registration, and the standard annual rate in subsequent years.
* The £10 reduction for alternative fuel vehicles and hybrid vehicles will be removed, bringing them also onto the standard rate.
* The exemption from the expensive car supplement was already due to end in 2025.

==Other vehicle tax rates==
===Light goods vehicles (TC39)===
Registered on or after 1 March 2001 and not over 3,500 kg revenue weight (also known as maximum or gross vehicle weight).
===Euro 4 light goods vehicles (TC36)===
Registered between 1 March 2003 and 31 December 2006, Euro 4 compliant and not over 3,500 kg revenue weight.
===Euro 5 light goods vehicles (TC36)===
Registered between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010, Euro 5 compliant and not over 3,500 kg revenue weight.
===Motorcycle (with or without sidecar) (TC17)===
===Tricycles (not over 450kg unladen) (TC50)===
===Trade licences===
Trade licences are available for between 6 and 12 months, depending on the month in which the application is made.
===Heavy goods vehicles===
VED payable for heavy goods vehicles (those over 3,500 kg revenue weight) varies according to their weight and axle configuration. The 12-month rates applicable from 1 August 2023 range from £80 to £850.

An additional HGV levy for vehicles with a revenue weight of 12,000 kg or more was introduced with effect from 1 April 2014. The levy is paid at the same time as VED, the amount varying according to weight, axle configuration and emissions rating; there are higher levies for vehicles pulling a trailer of over 4,000 kg. The 12-month levies applicable from 1 August 2023 range from £150 to £749.

Vehicles over 12,000 kg that are not registered in the UK must also pay the HGV levy before entering the UK, although zero-emission vehicles are exempt. Payment can be made on a daily, weekly, monthly or annual basis. The rate ranges from £3 per day (or £150 per year) to £10 per day (or £749 per year).

The HGV levy was suspended from 1 August 2020 to 31 July 2023 to support the haulage sector and aid pandemic recovery efforts.

==Exempt vehicles==
Various classes and uses of vehicle are exempt, including vehicles older than 40 years (see below), trams, vehicles which cannot convey people, police vehicles, fire engines, ambulances and health service vehicles, mine rescue vehicles, lifeboat vehicles, certain road construction and maintenance vehicles, vehicles for disabled people, certain agricultural and land maintenance vehicles, road gritters and snow ploughs, vehicles undergoing statutory tests, vehicles imported by members of foreign armed forces, and crown vehicles. Electrically propelled vehicles were exempt until 1995 (at a time when the most common electric vehicles were milk floats); today, they are not exempt, but are generally zero rated.

Each year on 1 April, vehicles constructed more than forty years before the start of that year become eligible for a free vehicle licence under &quot;historic vehicle&quot; legislation. This is due to the age of the vehicle and a presumption of limited mileage. Initially this was a rolling exemption applied to any vehicles over 25 years old; however, in 1997 the cutoff date was frozen at 1 January 1973. The change to &quot;pre-1973&quot; was unpopular in the classic motoring community, and a number of classic car clubs campaigned for a change back to the previous system. In 2006 there were 307,407 vehicles in this category.

As of 1 April 2014, vehicles manufactured before 1 January 1974 became exempt from the VED (Finance Act 2014, as set out in the 2013 Budget, 20 March 2013).

In the 2014 Budget, the government introduced a forty-year rolling exemption, with vehicles built before 1 January 1975 becoming exempt on 1 April 2015 and so on.

==Enforcement==
In 2008 it was reported that flaws in DVLA enforcement practices have meant that more than a million late-paying drivers per year have evaded detection, which lost £214 million in VED revenue during 2006. It was estimated that 6.7% of motorcycles were not taxed in 2007. Since then better systems reduced the loss to an estimated £33.9 million in 2009/2010.

Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems are being used to identify untaxed, uninsured vehicles and stolen cars.

==History==


Following the 1888 budget, two new vehicle duties were introduced – the &quot;locomotive duty&quot; and the &quot;trade cart duty&quot; (a general &quot;wheel-tax&quot; also announced in the same budget was abandoned). The &quot;locomotive duty&quot; was levied at £5 (equivalent to £ as of ), for each locomotive used on the public roads and the &quot;trade cart duty&quot; was introduced for all trade vehicles (including those which were mechanically powered) not subject to the existing &quot;carriage duty&quot;, with the exception of those used in agriculture and those weighing less than 10 cwt-imperial, at the rate of 5s (£0.25) per wheel.

===The Road Fund===
In the budget of 1909, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George announced that the roads system would be self-financing, and so from 1910 the proceeds of road vehicle excise duties were dedicated to fund the building and maintenance of the road system. Even during this period the majority of the cost of road building and improvement came from general and local taxation owing to the tax being too low for the upkeep of the roads.

The Roads Act 1920 required councils to &quot;register all new vehicles and to allocate a separate number to each vehicle&quot; and &quot;make provision for the collection and application of the excise duties on mechanically propelled vehicles and on carriages&quot;. The Finance Act 1920 introduced a &quot;Duty on licences for mechanically propelled vehicles&quot; which was to be &quot;hypothecated&quot; – that is, the revenue would be exclusively dedicated to a particular expenditure, namely the newly established Road Fund. Excise duties specifically for mechanically propelled vehicles were first imposed in 1921, along with the requirement to display a vehicle licence (tax disc) on the vehicle.

===End of hypothecation===
The accumulated Road Fund was never fully spent on roads (most of it was spent on resurfacing, not the building of new roads), and became notorious for being used for other government purposes, a practice introduced by Winston Churchill when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1926, by which time the direct use of taxes collected from motorists to fund the road network was already opposed by many in government, the Chancellor, Winston Churchill is reported to have said in a memo: &quot;Entertainments may be taxed; public houses may be taxed ... and the yield devoted to the general revenue. But motorists are to be privileged for all time to have the tax on motors devoted to roads? This is an outrage upon ... common sense.&quot; Hypothecation came to an end in 1937 under the 1936 Finance Act, and the proceeds of the vehicle road taxes were paid directly into the Exchequer. The Road Fund itself, then funded by government grants, was not abolished until 1955.

===1990s===
Since 1998, keepers of registered vehicles which had been licensed since 1998, but which were not currently using the public roads, have been required to submit an annual &quot;Statutory Off-Road Notification&quot; (SORN). Failure to submit a SORN is punishable in the same manner as failure to pay duty when using the vehicle on public roads. It was announced in the 2013 Budget that SORN declarations would become perpetual, thus removing the need for annual renewal after the initial declaration has been made. In June 1999, a reduced VED band was introduced for cars with an engine capacity up to 1100cc. The cost of 12 months tax for cars up to 1100cc was £100, and for those above 1100cc was £155.

===Emissions ratings tax===
During the 1990s, political arguments were put forward for the abolition of VED. Among the proposals was a suggestion that VED could be replaced by increased fuel duty as an incentive for consumers to purchase vehicles with lower emission ratings. The proposal was politically unappealing, as it would increase costs for businesses and for people living in rural areas. Rather than abolish VED, the Labour government under Tony Blair introduced a new system for calculating of VED that was linked explicitly with a vehicle&#x27;s carbon emissions ratings, as a means for vehicle emissions control. Since then, VED was levied in a system of tax bands based on CO2 ratings.

In the pre-budget report of 27 November 2001 the Government announced that VED for HGVs could be replaced, by a new tax based on distance travelled, the Lorry Road-User Charge (LRUC). At the same time, the rate of fuel duty would be cut for such vehicles. As at the start of 2007 this scheme is still at a proposal stage and no indicated start date has been given. The primary aim of the proposed change was that HGVs from the UK and the continent would pay exactly the same to use British roads (removing the ability of foreign vehicles to pay no UK tax). However, it was also expected that the tax would be used to influence routes taken (charging lower rates to use motorways), reduce congestion (by varying the charge with time of day), and encourage low emissions ratings vehicles.

In tax year 2002–2003, it is estimated that evasion of the tax equated to a loss to the Exchequer of £206 million. In an attempt to reduce this, from 2004 an automatic £80 penalty (halved if paid within 28 days) is issued by the DVLA computer for failure to pay the tax within one month of expiry. A maximum fine of £1,000 applies for failure to pay the tax, though in practice fines are normally much lower.

In June 2005 the government announced plans to adopt a road user charging scheme for all road vehicles, which would work by tracing the movement of vehicles using a telematics system. The idea raised objections on civil and human rights grounds that it would amount to mass surveillance. An online petition protesting this was started and reached over 1.8 million signatures by the closing date of 20 February 2007.

In April 2009 there was a reclassification to the CO2 rating based bandings with the highest set at £455 per year and the lowest at £0; the bandings have also been backdated to cover vehicles registered on or after 1 March 2001, meaning that vehicles with the highest emissions ratings registered after this date pay the most. Vehicles registered before 1 March 2001 will still continued to be charged according to engine size, above or below 1549cc.

In 2009 a consultation document from the Scottish Government raised the possibility of a VED on all road users including cyclists, but there was a strong consensus against this.

From 2010 a new first year rate is to be introduced – dubbed a &quot;showroom tax&quot;. This new tax was announced in the 2008 budget, and the level of tax payable will be based on the vehicle excise duty band, ranging from £0 for vehicles in the lower bands, up to £950 for vehicles in the highest band.

VED can be automatically be collected from a bank account by Direct Debit, but this cannot be applied to vehicles with a £0 VED; for these, a paper reminder is sent to the registered keeper, who then has to renew at a post office or online. 34,000 drivers were fined in 2017/18 for not renewing.

<text>&quot;Love&#x27;s Philosophy&quot; is a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley published in 1819.

==Background==

The poem was published by Leigh Hunt in the December 22, 1819 issue of &quot;The Indicator&quot; and reprinted in &quot;Posthumous Poems&quot; in 1824 edited by Mary Shelley. It was included in the Harvard manuscript book where it is headed &quot;An Anacreontic&quot;, dated &quot;January, 1820&quot;. Anacreontics are poems written in the style of the ancient Greek poet Anacreon, known for his celebrations of love. Shelley wrote it in a copy of Leigh Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Literary Pocket-Book&quot;, 1819, which was presented to Sophia Stacey, December 29, 1820.

The poem is divided in two 8-line stanzas with an ABABCDCD rhyme scheme.

The main theme is the relationship between the &quot;connection&quot; that exists for things in the natural world and the poet&#x27;s desire to be connected to his object of affection. Shelley asks how there can be unity in nature but a lack of union in human relationships.

The poetic devices Shelley uses in the poem include Personification (Fountains mingle with the river; Winds of heaven mix forever with a sweet emotion; The mountains kiss high heaven; The waves clasp one another; Moonbeams kiss the sea), Metaphor (No sister flower could be forgiven if it disdained its
brother), and the Rhetorical question (If thou kiss not me?).

==In popular culture==
British composer Roger Quilter set the poem to music in 1905 in the composition Love&#x27;s Philosophy, Op. 3, No 1.

In 2003, David Gompper set the poem to music in a score for baritone and piano.

Choral composer David N. Childs set the poem to music scored for a four-part women&#x27;s choir and piano.

It was featured in &quot;Vienna, November 1908&quot;, the fifteenth episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.

The second stanza of the poem appears in the second season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

The poem was featured in the Season 2, Episode 1 of &quot;Lewis&quot; (TV Series) &quot;And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea&quot; directed by Dan Reed and written by Alan Plater.

<text>The Real Cancun is a 2003 American reality film directed by Rick de Oliveira and written by Brian Caldirola. Inspired by the reality television genre, this film followed the lives of sixteen Americans from March 13 to 23, 2003 as they celebrated spring break in Cancún, Mexico and experienced romantic relationships, emotional strife, or just had a good time.

The film received negative critical reviews and was a box office flop, earning a little over $5 million in the United States from a $7.5 million budget. It was the film debut of Laura Ramsey.

== Release ==
&quot;The Real Cancun&quot; was released theatrically only a month after filming was completed, and was released on DVD and home video only a couple of months after that.

=== Box office ===
The film earned $2,108,796 in its opening weekend from 2,261 venues, ranking tenth in the North American box office and fourth among the week&#x27;s new releases. It closed a month later, having grossed $3,825,421 domestically and $1,519,662 overseas for a worldwide total of $5,345,083, coming well short of its $7.5 million production cost.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Real Cancun&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics (with &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Scott Foundas causing to remark in his review that &quot;The Real Cancun&quot; billed itself as &quot;the first reality feature film&quot; is &quot;apparently ignoring last year&#x27;s &quot;&quot;&quot;). On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 35% score based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;The footage is predictable and rather tame, and most of the people are uninteresting.&quot; Metacritic reports a 34 out of 100 rating based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

=== Awards and nominations ===
The film was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie (All Concept/No Content) at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards. It lost both awards to &quot;Gigli&quot; for the former and &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; for the latter.

== Thematic analysis ==
Carol Siegel, a professor of English and American Studies at Washington State University Vancouver, interpreted &quot;The Real Cancun&quot; as about society&#x27;s expectations of juveniles&#x27; sexual behaviors; despite visuals such as near nudity and simulations of the act, the characters try to present themselves as being abstinent and not &quot;slut&quot;-ty, and only two couples make love by the end.

== Aftermath ==
A reality movie based upon the &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; video series that MGM bought the rights to was never put into production, while the Universal Pictures effort &quot;Drunken Jackasses: The Quest&quot; was delayed after the flop of &quot;Cancun&quot; and ultimately went straight to video.

<text>Codex 3227a of the in Nuremberg (also known as &quot;Hs. 3227a&quot;, GNM 3227a, ) is a manuscript of 169 folia, dated to the close of the 14th century. Its text is written in Latin and German. The German portions have been identified as in East Central German dialect.

The composition of the manuscript is sometimes dated to 1389 on the basis of the calendar on fol. 83v which covers the years 1390–1495 (assuming that the scribe compiled the calendar for future reference only), but it has been noted that nothing precludes a date in the first quarter of the 15th century.

By the late 15th century, the manuscript was owned by Nicolaus Pol, who left the inscription . Pol is known as the personal surgeon to the emperors at Innsbruck from 1495. After Pol&#x27;s death in 1532, his library, presumably including this manuscript, passed to Innichen Abbey in South Tyrol. The fate of the manuscript during the 17th and 18th centuries is unknown, but it was part of the library of Hans Freiherr von und zu Aufsess, from which it passed to the in 1852.

The manuscript is a pragmatic commonplace book apparently compiled for the scribe&#x27;s personal use. It is an early example of such a compilation (if indeed it dates to before 1400), and is as such notable as a document of the transition from oral to written tradition during the late medieval period.

The compilation contains notes on an eclectic variety of topics, including alchemy, magical formulas, conjuring tricks, chemical recipes for fireworks, paints, medicine, ironworking, etc.

A substantial portion of the manuscript is a combat manual, making it of particular notability for the study of Historical European Martial Arts. It is the earliest record of the German school of fencing in the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer. Liechtenauer is here for the first time mentioned by name, and his teachings quoted. His tradition of martial arts, especially the fencing with the longsword would remain influential in Germany throughout the 15th and for much of the 16th century.

The manuscript text had never been edited in print prior to its notability to the Historical European Martial Arts revival. The study of relevant combat treatises was guided by the seminal dissertation by Hils (1985), and the first full transcriptions were published online.

Hils (1985, p. 106) identified Hanko Döbringer as the author of the manuscript, a mistake inherited from the earlier survey by Wierschin (1965). It was inspired by the fact that the name is written on the page margin on fol. 43r. When the manuscript text was edited, it became clear that Döbringer&#x27;s name was added in the margin because it had been omitted by accident from a list of four &quot;other masters&quot; discussed on that page. This mistake has resulted in the manuscript being also known as &quot;Codex Döbringer&quot; (so Ehlert and Leng 2003) or similar.

<text>Lowell Gibbs &quot;Cotton&quot; Fitzsimmons (October 7, 1931 – July 24, 2004) was an American college and NBA basketball coach. A native of Bowling Green, Missouri, he attended and played basketball at Hannibal-LaGrange Junior College in Hannibal, Missouri and Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. He coached the Phoenix Suns three times, was named the NBA Coach of the Year twice, and is often credited as the architect of the Suns&#x27; success of the late 1980s and early to middle 1990s. Fitzsimmons won 1,089 games in his coaching career: 223 games at the junior college level, 34 at the Division I college level and 832 in the NBA.

On May 16, 2021, it was announced that Fitzsimmons was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. The Class of 2021 enshrinement ceremony occurred on September 11, 2021.

==Early life==
Lowell Gibbs &quot;Cotton&quot; Fitzsimmons was born on October 7, 1931, in Hannibal, Missouri, to Clancy and Zelda Fitzsimmons. Fitzsimmons was raised in Bowling Green, Missouri, where he attended Bowling Green High School.

The family of six moved to Bowling Green when Lowell was young. There, his fourth grade classmates nicknamed him &quot;Cotton&quot; because of his hair. His father died when he was in fifth grade. His mother raised Cotton and three siblings.

In high school, Bowling Green High School basketball coach James A. Wilson became a key figure for Fitzsimmons. Fitzsimmons said: “Coach Wilson had the biggest influence on me of any male adult. He taught me the difference between rules and principles. Rules are made to be bent, sometimes even broken. Principles are something you live by. My mother raised me, of course, but I think I looked up to Coach Wilson as a father figure and wanted to be like him.”

With the 5&#x27;7&quot; Fitzsimmons, Bowling Green High School twice advanced to the Missouri State High School Basketball Tournament.

After graduating from Bowling Green High School, Fitzsimmons worked at a brick plant in nearby Farber, Missouri. He worked for two years to help support the family until his sisters graduated from high school, just as his older brother Orland had done. During those two years, Cotton played 80 game seasons for the brickyard basketball team, was a basketball referee for local high school games and was a baseball infielder on a Bowling Green town baseball team, serving as the team manager. On his first taste of coaching, he recalled, &quot;It&#x27;s not easy going to the mound as a kid and taking out your pitcher, who&#x27;s probably 30.&quot;

==College career==
In 1952, Fitzsimmons enrolled at Hannibal-LaGrange College (HLG), then a junior college in Hannibal, Missouri.
Fitzsimmons became a junior-college All-American, averaging 25.5 points a game at Hannibal-LaGrange (where his jersey is now retired). He led the team to the NJCAA Tournament.

Fitzsimmons left Missouri to attend Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. There, he averaged 13.3 points over 82 games and scored a career 1,095 points, while helping the Mustangs to the NAIA Tournament quarterfinals in 1956. Fitzsimmons turned down an offer to play AAU basketball for the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots and remained at Midwestern State after graduation to earn a master&#x27;s degree in administrative education. He decided his ambition was to become a professional basketball coach.

==Coaching career==
===Moberly Junior College (1958–1967)===
After earning his degrees at Midwestern State, Fitzsimmons returned to Missouri. He accepted the position as head coach at Moberly Junior College in Moberly, Missouri in 1958, replacing Maury John. Fitzsimmons coached for nine seasons (1958–1967) at Moberly, with a record of 223–59 (.790). When asked in his interview how long he planned to stay at Moberly if hired, &quot;“I gave him the dumbest answer I ever gave anyone,” he said, “I told him I’d be there till we won two titles in a row.”
Fitzsimmons proceeded to finish his tenure at Moberly with back-to-back NJCAA National Championships, in 1966 and 1967.

===Kansas State University (1967–1970)===
Fitzsimmons was hired by Kansas State University, serving as an assistant coach in 1967–1968 under Head Coach Tex Winter. There he learned the Triangle Offense from Winter, who left after the season for Washington and recommended Fitzsimmons to replace him. In 1968, he was named Head Coach at Kansas State. Fitzsimmons&#x27; first team at KSU finished 14–12. In 1969–1970, The Wildcats went a surprising 20–8, capturing the Big 8 Conference Championship. He was named 1970 Big 8 Coach of the Year and led the Wildcats to the Sweet Sixteen of the 1970 NCAA tournament. Fitzsimmons then moved to the NBA with the Phoenix Suns.

===Phoenix Suns (1970–1972)===
In 1970, Fitzsimmons replaced Jerry Colangelo as head coach of the Phoenix Suns. It was Colangelo, serving as General Manager, who sought Fitzsimmons for the position. At first Colangelo had called Fitzsimmons and asked about other possible candidates. Eventually, Colangelo asked Fitzsimmons, “How would you like the job?” Fitzsimmons took the position and led the Suns to their first winning season, going 48–34 that season. The relationship between Colangelo and Fitzsimmons would be lengthy, as Fitzsimmons would serve the Suns in multiple capacities, including three tenures as head coach. Fitzsimmons worked with Colangelo without any discussion of compensation throughout their long tenure together.

===Atlanta Hawks (1972–1976)===
Fitzsimmons was released from the remaining two years of his Suns contract by Colangelo to allow him to accept a similar capacity with the Atlanta Hawks on May 31, 1972. He was 140–180 in four seasons, with one playoff appearance. He returned to Phoenix to reside in 1975, although he still coached the Hawks. According to Fitzsimmons, one of the main reasons he accepted a job as Hawks coach was the opportunity to coach Pete Maravich. The Hawks traded Maravich to the New Orleans Jazz in May 1974 and Fitzsimmons was left with a young team and a rotating front office.“Presidents and GMs were flying out of here like paper clips.” he told Sports Illustrated. With the Hawks at 28–46 and mired in a ten-game losing streak, he was fired and assistant coach Bumper Tormohlen promoted to replace him on an interim basis on March 30, 1976.

===Golden State Warriors (1976–1977)===
On August 4, 1976, Fitzsimmons was hired as player personnel director for the Golden State Warriors, to replace the late Bob Feerick, working alongside Al Attles, who was Coach and General Manager. Attles said, &#x27;I have a long-standing relation with Cotton and have always admired and respected him as a person, coach, and evaluator of talent,&quot; There, the team made a series of trades of veteran players to acquire future draft picks.

===Buffalo Braves (1977–1978)===
Fitzsimmons quickly returned to coaching, becoming head coach by the Buffalo Braves, hired by General Manager Norm Sonju on August 5, 1977. His one season as Braves head coach (27–55) was the team&#x27;s last in Buffalo. The franchise moved to become the San Diego Clippers. The Braves changed owners and the team was moved and rebranded and Fitzsimmons reflected of his tenure jokingly, “I think Buffalo got a raw deal as far as the NBA,” he said years later. “I enjoyed everything Buffalo. What I feel bad about is the franchise … I guess I’ve got to take credit for folding the franchise.”

===Kansas City Kings (1978–1984)===
After he was released from the remaining two years of his contract with the Braves, Fitzsimmons was appointed to a similar capacity with the Kansas City Kings on May 10, 1978. He succeeded assistant general manager Larry Staverman who also finished the Kings&#x27; 31–51 1977–78 campaign as its interim head coach. Fitzsimmons spent six seasons with the Kings, with a 248–244 record and four playoff appearances. He won the 1979 NBA Coach of the Year Award,as the Kings finished 48–34 after finishing 31–51 the previous season. In the 1981 playoffs the 6th seed, with a losing regular season record, the Kings knocked off the top-seeded Phoenix Suns and advanced to the Western Conference finals, where they lost to the Houston Rockets in five games. Prior to the 1983–1984 season, the Kansas City Kings were sold to a group in Sacramento, California and the franchise was in limbo with a pending move to Sacramento. The Kings qualified for the playoffs and Fitzsimmons resigned after the season.

===San Antonio Spurs (1984–1986)===
On May 9, 1984, Fitzsimmons left Kansas City to become head coach of the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs were 76–88 in Fitzsimmons two seasons, qualifying for the playoffs both seasons. Fitzsimmons was fired by the Spurs on April 29, 1986.

===Phoenix Suns (1986–1992, 1996–1997)===
Colangelo and Fitzsimmons reunited in 1986, as Fitzsimmons returned to the Suns organization, joining Colangelo in the Suns&#x27; front office. He would later return to the bench as head coach of the Suns in 1988. He was one of the driving forces behind the trade that sent Larry Nance to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kevin Johnson, Mark West and a future first-round draft pick (who was Dan Majerle). The Suns also drafted Steve Kerr in the second round in 1988.

Fitzsimmons was criticized both by Suns fans and basketball critics after the trade; Nance was very popular in Phoenix. But the Suns had come off a chaotic 1987–1988 season in which they won 28 games and lost 54, and the team had been shaken by a drug scandal.SPORTS PEOPLE; Dismissal Sought (Published 1987) With the first round draft pick of 1988, the Suns chose Dan Majerle, and the franchise had a turn-around season, winning 55 games and losing 27 before advancing all the way to the Western Conference&#x27;s Finals that season, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Lakers.

During the 1988 Draft when Majerle was booed by the fans, Fitzsimmons publicly chastised them by saying, &quot;you&#x27;ll be sorry that you booed this young man.&quot;

In 1989, he won his second NBA Coach of the Year Award. Fitzsimmons inherited a team that had finished 28–54, and improved them to 55–27. The Suns defeated the Denver Nuggets (3–0) and Golden State Warriors (4–1) in the playoffs before being swept by the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals.

After another successful season, the Suns returned to the NBA playoffs in 1990. This time around, they returned the favor on the Lakers, beating them 4 games to 1 at the Western Conference&#x27;s Semi-Finals, but once again, Fitzsimmons&#x27; team fell short at the NBA&#x27;s Western Conference Finals, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers, 4 games to 2.

In 1991, the Suns lost to the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Playoffs&#x27; first round, 3 games to 1. During the rest of the playoffs, Fitzsimmons served briefly as a color commentator for NBC, most notably, alongside Marv Albert for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Chicago Bulls and the Detroit Pistons. In 1992, Cotton Fitzsimmons became only the sixth coach in NBA history to reach 800 wins.

After losing to the Trail Blazers in that year&#x27;s Western Conference Semifinals, 4 games to 1, Fitzsimmons retired as coach, to work as Suns senior executive vice-president. By then a long-time friend of Colangelo, he helped Colangelo decide to trade Jeff Hornacek, Andrew Lang and Tim Perry for Charles Barkley, while also helping with the decision of signing free agent Danny Ainge. He also did television commentary, joining Al McCoy for Suns broadcasts.

In 1996, Fitzsimmons became the Suns head coach for the third time, guiding the Suns to the NBA Playoffs, where they lost to the Spurs, 3 games to 1.

The 1996–97 Suns lost their first eight games, and Fitzsimmons resigned as head coach. With 832 wins and 775 losses, Fitzsimmons was the eighth winningest coach in NBA history. He has since slipped to number ten in the all-time winning list as an NBA coach.

==Personal life==
Fitzsimmons was diagnosed with lung cancer later on in life. His family chose to keep his health status private. Months after being diagnosed with cancer, his condition worsened because of a brain stroke. He suffered two more brain strokes before it was finally revealed to the public that he was in serious condition at a local hospital. On July 25, 2004, the morning after his death, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; sports section&#x27;s headline read: &quot;Brightest Sun Fitzsimmons dies.&quot; He would be honored throughout the rest of the 2004–05 Phoenix Suns season with the team wearing a white patch on their jersey representing him honoring his memory for the entire season. He was 72 years old.

&quot;Cotton Fitzsimmons embodied all things that are great about life and the game of basketball,&quot; Suns chairman and CEO Jerry Colangelo said. &quot;His energy, passion and upbeat approach to everything impacted those that he touched in a positive and meaningful way.&quot;

Fitzsimmons was survived by his wife JoAnn, and his son, Gary. Gary Fitzsimmons has had a lengthy career as a basketball assistant coach, scout and executive. He serves as vice president and assistant general manager of the Atlanta Hawks.

Mabel McCormick, a program supporter (her husband was the volunteer team doctor) who kept the scorebook and statistics for Fitzsimmons at Moberly Community College, lived to be over 100 years old. She said her relationship with Fitzsimmons was special. McCormick said that she played a role in recruiting Fitzsimmons to Moberly after having seen him play at Hannibal-LaGrange, saying she went to the board and recommended him, along with an influential sports writer from the area. &quot;I was convinced he was the right person,&quot; she said. She said of their relationship afterwards, “During his days here, Cotton was like a member of my family. He probably is my favorite. Even after he left Moberly and ended up with professional basketball we kept in close contact with one another and he would come to Moberly to visit me.”

“You&#x27;re not going to make me have a bad day. If there&#x27;s oxygen on earth and I&#x27;m breathing, it&#x27;s going to be a good day.”
― Fitzsimmons

<doc id="858340" wikidata="Q1998660" url="?curid=858340" title="North Sea oil">
<text>North Sea oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons, comprising liquid petroleum and natural gas, produced from petroleum reservoirs beneath the North Sea.

In the petroleum industry, the term &quot;North Sea&quot; often includes areas such as the Norwegian Sea and the area known as &quot;West of Shetland&quot;, &quot;the Atlantic Frontier&quot; or &quot;the Atlantic Margin&quot; that is not geographically part of the North Sea.

Brent crude is still used today as a standard benchmark for pricing oil, although the contract now refers to a blend of oils from fields in the northern North Sea.

From the 1960s to 2014 it was reported that 42 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) had been extracted from the North Sea since when production began. As there is still an estimated 24 billion BOE potentially remaining in the reservoir (equivalent to about 35 years worth of production), the North Sea will remain as an important petroleum reservoir for years to come. However, this is the upper end of a range of estimates provided by Sir Ian Wood (commissioned by the UK government to carry out a review of the oil industry in the United Kingdom ); the lower end was 12 billion barrels. Wood, upset with how his figures were being used, said the most likely amount to be found would be between 15 billion and 16 billion barrels.

==History==

===1851–1963===
Commercial extraction of oil on the shores of the North Sea dates back to 1851, when James Young retorted oil from torbanite (boghead coal, or oil shale) mined in the Midland Valley of Scotland. Across the sea in Germany, oil was found in the Wietze field near Hanover in 1859, leading to the discovery of seventy more fields, mostly in Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic reservoirs, producing a combined total of around 1340 m³ (8,400 barrels) per day.

Gas was found by chance in a water well near Hamburg in 1910, leading to minor gas discoveries in Zechstein dolomites elsewhere in Germany. In England, BP discovered gas in similar reservoirs in the Eskdale anticline in 1938, and in 1939 they found commercial oil in Carboniferous rocks at Eakring in Nottinghamshire. Discoveries elsewhere in the East Midlands lifted production to 400 m³ (2,500 barrels) per day, and a second wave of exploration from 1953 to 1961 found the Gainsborough field and ten smaller fields.

The Netherlands&#x27; first oil shows were seen in a drilling demonstration at De Mient during the 1938 World Petroleum Congress at The Hague. Subsequent exploration led to the 1943 discovery by Exploratie Nederland, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell company Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij, of oil under the Dutch village of Schoonebeek, near the German border. NAM found the Netherlands&#x27; first gas in Zechstein carbonates at Coevorden in 1948. 1952 saw the first exploration well in the province of Groningen, Haren-1, which was the first to penetrate the Lower Permian Rotliegendes sandstone that is the main reservoir for the gas fields of the southern North Sea, although in Haren-1 it contained only water. The Ten Boer well failed to reach target depth for technical reasons, but was completed as a minor gas producer from the Zechstein carbonates. The Slochteren-1 well found gas in the Rotliegendes in 1959, although the full extent of what became known as the Groningen gas field was not appreciated until 1963—it is currently estimated at ≈ recoverable gas reserves. Smaller discoveries to the west of Groningen followed.

===1964–present===
The UK Continental Shelf Act came into force in May 1964. Seismic exploration and the first well followed later that year. It and a second well on the Mid North Sea High were dry, as the Rotliegendes was absent, but BP&#x27;s &quot;Sea Gem&quot; rig struck gas in the West Sole Field in September 1965. The celebrations were short-lived since the &quot;Sea Gem&quot; sank, with the loss of 13 lives, after part of the rig collapsed as it was moved away from the discovery well. The Viking Gas Field was discovered in December 1965 with the Conoco/National Coal Board well 49/17-1, finding the gas-bearing Permian Rotliegend Sandstone at a depth of 2,756 m subsea. Helicopters were first used to transport workers. Larger gas finds followed in 1966 – Leman Bank, Indefatigable and Hewett – but by 1968 companies had lost interest in further exploration of the British sector, a result of a ban on gas exports and low prices offered by the only buyer, British Gas. West Sole came onstream in May 1967. Licensing regulations for Dutch waters were not finalised until 1967.

The situation was transformed in December 1969, when Phillips Petroleum discovered oil in Chalk of Danian age at Ekofisk, in Norwegian waters in the central North Sea. The same month, Amoco discovered the Montrose Field about east of Aberdeen. The original objective of the well had been to drill for gas to test the idea that the southern North Sea gas province extended to the north. Amoco were astonished when the well discovered oil. BP had been awarded several licences in the area in the second licensing round late in 1965, but had been reluctant to work on them. The discovery of Ekofisk prompted them to drill what turned out to be a dry hole in May 1970, followed by the discovery of the giant Forties Oil Field in October 1970. The following year, Shell Expro discovered the giant Brent oilfield in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in Scotland and the Petronord Group discovered the Frigg gas field. The Piper oilfield was discovered in 1973 and the Statfjord Field and the Ninian Field in 1974, with the Ninian reservoir consisting of Middle Jurassic sandstones at a depth of 3000 m subsea in a &quot;westward tilted horst block&quot;.

Offshore production, like that of the North Sea, became more economical after the 1973 oil crisis caused the world oil price to quadruple, followed by the 1979 oil crisis, which caused another tripling in the oil price. Oil production started from the Argyll &amp; Duncan Oilfields (now the Ardmore) in June 1975 followed by Forties Oil Field in November of that year. The inner Moray Firth Beatrice Field, a Jurassic sandstone/shale reservoir 1829 m deep in a &quot;fault-bounded anticlinal trap&quot;, was discovered in 1976 with well 11/30-1, drilled by the Mesa Petroleum Group (named after T. Boone Pickens&#x27; wife Bea, &quot;the only oil field in the North Sea named for a woman&quot;) in 49 m of water.
Volatile weather conditions in Europe&#x27;s North Sea have made drilling particularly hazardous, claiming many lives (see Oil platform). The conditions also make extraction a costly process; by the 1980s, costs for developing new methods and technologies to make the process both efficient and safe far exceeded NASA&#x27;s budget to land a man on the moon. The exploration of the North Sea has continually pushed the edges of the technology of exploitation (in terms of what can be produced) and later the technologies of discovery and evaluation (2-D seismic, followed by 3-D and 4-D seismic; sub-salt seismic; immersive display and analysis suites and supercomputing to handle the flood of computation required). 

The Gullfaks oil field was discovered in 1978. The Snorre Field was discovered in 1979, producing from the Triassic Lunde Formation and the Triassic-Jurassic Statfjord Formation, both fluvial sandstones in a mudstone matrix. The Oseberg oil field and Troll gas field were also discovered in 1979. The Miller oilfield was discovered in 1983. The Alba Field produces from sandstones in the middle Eocene Alba Formation at 1860 m subsea and was discovered in 1984 in UKCS Block 16/26. The Smørbukk Field was discovered in 1984 in 250–300 m of water that produces from Lower to Middle Jurassic sandstone formations within a fault block. The Snøhvit Gas Field and the Draugen oil field were discovered in 1984. The Heidrun oil field was discovered in 1985.

The largest UK field discovered in the past twenty-five years is Buzzard, also located off Scotland, found in June 2001 with producible reserves of almost 64×106 m³ (400m bbl) and an average output of 28,600 m3 to 30,200 m3 (180,000–220,000 bbl) per day.

The largest field found in the past five years on the Norwegian part of the North Sea is the Johan Sverdrup oil field, which was discovered in 2010. It is one of the largest discoveries made in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Total reserves of the field are estimated at 1.7 to 3.3 billion barrels of gross recoverable oil, and Johan Sverdrup is expected to produce 120,000 to 200,000 barrels of oil per day. Production started on 5 October 2019. 

, the North Sea was the world&#x27;s most active offshore drilling region, with 173 active rigs drilling. By May 2016, the North Sea oil and gas industry was financially stressed by the reduced oil prices, and called for government support.

The distances, number of workplaces, and fierce weather in the 750,000 square kilometre (290,000 square mile) North Sea area require the world&#x27;s largest fleet of heavy instrument flight rules (IFR) helicopters, some specifically developed for the North Sea. They carry about two million passengers per year from sixteen onshore bases, of which Aberdeen Airport is the world&#x27;s busiest, with 500,000 passengers per year.

==Licensing==

Following the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf and after some disputes on the rights to natural resource exploitation the national limits of the exclusive economic zones were ratified.
Five countries are involved in oil production in the North Sea. All operate a tax and royalty licensing regime. The respective sectors are divided by median lines agreed in the late 1960s:
* Norway – Oljedirektoratet (the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate grants licences. The NCS is also divided into quads of 1 degree by 1 degree. Norwegian licence blocks are larger than British blocks, being 15 minutes of latitude by 20 minutes of longitude (12 blocks in a quad). Like in Britain, there are numerous part blocks formed by re-licensing relinquished areas.
* United Kingdom – Exploration and production licences are regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority following the 2014 Wood Review on maximising UKCS (United Kingdom Continental Shelf) oil and gas recovery. Licences were formerly granted by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC – formerly the Department of Trade and Industry). The UKCS is divided into quadrants of 1 degree latitude and one degree longitude. Each quadrant is divided into 30 blocks measuring 10 minutes of latitude and 12 minutes of longitude. Some blocks are divided further into part blocks where some areas are relinquished by previous licensees. For example, block 13/24a is located in quad 13 and is the 24th block and is the &#x27;a&#x27; part block. The UK government has traditionally issued licences via periodic (now annual) licensing rounds. Blocks are awarded on the basis of the work programme bid by the participants. The UK government has actively solicited new entrants to the UKCS via &quot;promote&quot; licensing rounds with less demanding terms and the fallow acreage initiative, where non-active licences have to be relinquished.
* Denmark – Energistyrelsen (the Danish Energy Agency) administers the Danish sector. The Danes also divide their sector of the North Sea into 1 degree by 1 degree quadrants. Their blocks, however, are 10 minutes latitude by 15 minutes longitude. Part blocks exist where partial relinquishment has taken place.
* Germany – Germany and the Netherlands share a quadrant and block grid—quadrants are given letters rather than numbers. The blocks are 10 minutes latitude by 20 minutes longitude.
*Netherlands – The Dutch sector is located in the Southern Gas Basin and shares a grid pattern with Germany.

==Reserves and production==
The Norwegian and British sectors hold most of the large oil reserves. It is estimated that the Norwegian sector alone contains 54% of the sea&#x27;s oil reserves and 45% of its gas reserves.
More than half of the North Sea oil reserves have been extracted, according to official sources in both Norway and the UK. For Norway, Oljedirektoratet gives a figure of 4,601 million cubic metres of oil (corresponding to 29 billion barrels) for the Norwegian North Sea alone (excluding smaller reserves in Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea) of which 2,778 million cubic metres (60%) has already been produced prior to January 2007. UK sources give a range of estimates of reserves, but even using the most optimistic &quot;maximum&quot; estimate of ultimate recovery, 76% had been recovered as of the end of 2010. Note the UK figure includes fields which are not in the North Sea (onshore, West of Shetland).

United Kingdom Continental Shelf production was 137 million tonnes of oil and 105 billion m³ of gas in 1999. (1 tonne of crude oil converts to 7.5 barrels). The Danish explorations of Cenozoic stratigraphy, undertaken in the 1990s, showed petroleum-rich reserves in the northern Danish sector, especially the Central Graben area. The Dutch area of the North Sea followed through with onshore and offshore gas exploration, and well creation.
Exact figures are debatable, because methods of estimating reserves vary and it is often difficult to forecast future discoveries.

==Peaking and decline==
Official production data from 1995 to 2020 is published by the UK government. Table 3.10 lists annual production, import and exports over that period. 
When it peaked in 1999, production of North Sea oil was 128 million tonnes per year, approx, 950,000 m³ (6 million barrels) per day, having risen by ~ 5% from the early 1990s.
However, by 2010 this had halved to under 60 million tonnes/year, and continued declining further, and between 2015 and 2020 has hovered between 40 and 50 million tonnes/year, at around 35% of the 1999 peak. From 2005 the UK became a net importer of crude oil, and as production declined, the amount imported has slowly risen to ~ 20 million tonnes per year by 2020.

Similar historical data is available for gas. Natural gas production peaked at nearly 10 trillion cubic feet (280×109 m³) in 2001 representing some 1.2GWhr of energy; by 2018 UK production had declined to 1.4 trillion cubic feet, (41×109 m³). Over a similar period energy from gas imports have risen by a factor of approximately 10, from 60GWh in 2001 to just over 500GWh in 2019.

UK oil production has seen two peaks, in the mid-1980s and the late 1990s, with a decline to around 300×103 m³ (1.9 million barrels) per day in the early 1990s. Monthly oil production peaked at 13.5×106 m³ (84.9 million barrels) in January 1985 although the highest annual production was seen in 1999, with offshore oil production in that year of 407×106 m³ (398 million barrels) and had declined to 231×106 m³ (220 million barrels) in 2007. This was the largest decrease of any oil-exporting nation in the world, and has led to Britain becoming a net importer of crude for the first time in decades, as recognized by the energy policy of the United Kingdom. Norwegian crude oil production as of 2013 is 1.4 mbpd. This is a more than 50% decline since the peak in 2001 of 3.2 mbpd.

=== Geology ===
The geological disposition of the UK&#x27;s oil and gas fields is outlined in the following table.
==Carbon dioxide sequestration==
In the North Sea, Norway&#x27;s Equinor natural-gas platform Sleipner strips carbon dioxide out of the natural gas with amine solvents and disposes of this carbon dioxide by geological sequestration (&quot;carbon sequestration&quot;) while keeping up gas production pressure. Sleipner reduces emissions of carbon dioxide by approximately one million tonnes a year; that is about of global emissions. The cost of geological sequestration is minor relative to the overall running costs.

<text>Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Ross (later Talbot and then Banner) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #1 (1962) as a romantic interest of the Hulk (Dr. Bruce Banner). She is the daughter of General Thaddeus E. &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross. Over the years, the character has undergone multiple transformations, including the Harpy and Red She-Hulk.

The character was portrayed by Jennifer Connelly in &quot;Hulk&quot; (2003). The character has also appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) portrayed by Liv Tyler in the films &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008) and &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot; (2025). An alternate version appeared in the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021) voiced by Stephanie Panisello.

==Publication history==
Betty Ross debuted in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #1 (May 1962) by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. She was an on-and-off again supporting character in the Hulk&#x27;s various series for decades, serving as his longest-running love interest. In 1989, Betty Ross Banner received an entry in &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update &#x27;89&quot; #1.

Stan Lee originally portrayed Betty Ross as a strong willed and independent-minded, yet conventionally polite woman. Mid-1980s &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; writer/artist John Byrne portrayed her as more wilful and confrontational, characterizations which would remain in place during Peter David&#x27;s long run as the series&#x27; writer. Betty has a miscarriage in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2 #360. Though this occurred during David&#x27;s run on the series, the issue was instead written by editor Bob Harras. David recalled, &quot;The reason I refused to do it was because Betty was really losing her child to editorial fiat. It was decided by the powers-that-be that Betty and Bruce were not to become parents because that would make the characters seem ‘too old’ to the younger readers. My run on the book almost ended with that issue; I nearly walked over it. But there were so many stories I still wanted to tell that ultimately I stayed with it, even though I fumed about it for quite a while.&quot;

In &quot;Hulk&quot; vol. 2 #15 (September 2009), she appears for the first time as Red She-Hulk, who was created by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Ed McGuinness. Loeb said, &quot;We&#x27;ve been very careful with the creation of this character. We wanted to make sure she didn&#x27;t come off as silly—my memory of the introduction to [the original] She-Hulk—before anyone had read a page. But the character was a completely different take on the Hulk, a Hulk we&#x27;d never seen before. Jen [Walters] is a wonderful character. Our intention is [that] Red She-Hulk will make an equally important impression on the Marvel Universe .&quot;

Red She-Hulk is also present in the &quot;Chaos War&quot; and &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storylines in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Red She-Hulk becomes a member of the superhero team the Defenders in &quot;The Defenders&quot; vol. 4 #1 (December 2011) by writer Matt Fraction and artist Terry Dodson. Fraction said, &quot;The way I write her is somewhere between Indiana Jones and Johnny Knoxville; after a lifetime of being fought over and treated like a human football, she&#x27;s [now] seven foot tall and 62-52-62 or whatever and bulletproof. She goes around leaving these Betty-shaped holes in the wall.&quot; The series was discontinued in November 2012, after 12 issues.

In October 2012, as part of Marvel NOW!, &quot;Hulk&quot; was retitled &quot;Red She-Hulk&quot; starting with issue #58 by writer Jeff Parker and artist Carlo Pagulayan. About the series Parker said, &quot;She&#x27;s become convinced of a threat to humanity which is essentially, all people like her. She&#x27;s conflicted over losing her own human side, and she&#x27;s acting out on a large scale based on that. But the thing is she may well be right.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Early history===

The only daughter of General Thaddeus E. &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross, Betty spent her formative years firmly under her father&#x27;s strict supervision. After her mother died during Betty&#x27;s teenage years, she was sent away to boarding school. After graduating, the introverted young woman returned to her father&#x27;s side while he was in charge of a top-secret project to create a new type of weapon involving gamma radiation, known as the Gamma Bomb. The head scientist on the project was Bruce Banner. Betty was immediately captivated by Banner&#x27;s intellect and soft-spoken manner. However, less than an hour after their first meeting, Banner is caught in a test detonation of the Gamma Bomb and becomes the Hulk. Banner&#x27;s efforts to keep his condition a secret from Betty only serve to alienate her from him. She is then romantically pursued by Major Glenn Talbot, the new aide attached to her father&#x27;s Hulkbuster task force.

After his dual identity becomes public knowledge, Banner becomes a hunted fugitive. With the help of Reed Richards, Banner becomes able to gain control of his transformation, is eventually pardoned, and later proposes to Betty. During the wedding ceremony, the Hulk&#x27;s archenemy the Leader causes Banner to transform back into the Hulk, and Banner once again becomes a fugitive. General Ross is seriously injured when the Hulk runs amok while battling the Rhino, and Talbot promises Betty that the Hulk would pay for it.

As a result of the failed wedding and Banner&#x27;s relapse into the Hulk, Betty suffers a nervous breakdown and is hospitalized. In an effort by the Sandman to rid himself of his glass like form, the Sandman orders Dr. Marquand to provide him with a patient with the same blood type as him which turns out to be Betty Ross. As the result of the blood transfusion, the Sandman reverts to his previous form, yet Betty receives the glass properties, which Sandman surmises would eventually kill her. Betty&#x27;s father recruits Dr. Leonard Samson to reverse the effect by siphoning the Hulk&#x27;s gamma and psionic energies to simultaneously cure Bruce and Betty. The result would have permanently cured both of them, if not for Bruce purposefully re-exposing himself to the siphoned Gamma energy, as a means to combat Samson who had also done so, and was subsequently flirting with Betty. This ended in Hulk defeating Samson, yet later on Samson would pursue the Hulk.

Finding him in the aftermath of a battle as the Hulk, Betty hears Banner mumble, &quot;Jarella... my love...&quot; After Banner seemingly disappears from Earth, Betty accepts a marriage proposal from Glenn Talbot. While Betty and Talbot are on their honeymoon, her father is captured and sent to a Soviet prison. Talbot takes part in a successful rescue mission, but is captured in the process, held prisoner by the Gremlin at Bitterfrost (a top secret Soviet installation in Siberia), and believed dead.

===Becoming the Harpy===

The villain MODOK kidnaps Betty and subjects her to gamma radiation, at a higher level than Banner had been subjected to, transforming her into a bird hybrid creature called the Harpy. MODOK tells the Harpy where to find the Hulk and she flies off in search of him. She ambushes him and, after a lengthy fight, knocks him out with her hellbolts. Before she can take the Hulk back to MODOK, however, they are abducted by the Bi-Beast to his city in the sky. Banner agrees to repair the machines that cause the city to float in exchange for permission to use the advanced equipment to cure Betty. MODOK comes to the island and instigates a fight just as Banner starts the equipment. Banner, nonetheless, escapes the collapsing city with a now-cured Betty.

===Return===
Talbot is eventually rescued by General Ross, Clay Quartermain, and the Hulk. During his time in captivity by the Gremlin, Talbot was made into a mindless husk. To unblock Talbot&#x27;s mind, Doc Samson has the Hulk (who was, at that time, Banner&#x27;s mind controlling the Hulk&#x27;s body) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state. The process is, ultimately, a success. However, the Talbots&#x27; marriage later becomes strained.

When General Ross suffers a nervous breakdown, Talbot returns to the military as a Colonel and it is revealed that he had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the Sub-Atomic universe after the Hulk stormed into Gamma Base, looking for Jarella. This incident proves to be the last straw in Talbot&#x27;s already deteriorating relationship with Betty, and their marriage later ends in divorce. Blaming the failure of his marriage on Banner, whom he also tried to have court-martialed, Talbot steals the War Wagon prototype and dies in Japan while trying to destroy the Hulk. Betty admits to Rick Jones afterwards that she had never stopped loving Banner all the while she was married to Talbot.

When Betty learns that her father had conspired with MODOK to kill the Hulk, she accuses him of treason. Realizing Betty was right, Ross nearly commits suicide and then disappears.

Banner again achieves a state in which he can control his transformations and maintain his mind while in the form of the Hulk. But Betty is upset because she wants Banner to be rid of the Hulk, not to control him, and leaves him once again. When Doctor Strange banishes Hulk to the Crossroads, an alternative reality/inter-dimensional portal, Betty begins dating a man named Ramon. Upon learning that the Hulk had been sighted on Earth once again, Betty leaves Ramon and returns to Gamma Base, where the Hulk is subjected to a process that splits Banner and the Hulk into separate entities. Believing himself finally cured, Banner proposes to Betty, and she accepts. Betty&#x27;s father appears at the wedding, armed with a gun and demanding that the marriage not take place before shooting Rick Jones, who tries to stop him. Betty confronts her father, accusing him of domineering her throughout her life, as well as calling him out on his hostility towards Banner over the years, and cows him into surrendering the gun. Finally, Banner and Betty are pronounced husband and wife.

However, Banner begins dying as a result of being separated from the Hulk. The two are secretly merged once more. Betty soon discovers this. General Ross later dies before his daughter&#x27;s eyes, sacrificing his life to destroy an unnamed mutant that nearly killed both Betty and Banner seeking a strong host to whom to be parasitically linked.

Betty becomes distraught on learning that Banner had sometimes consciously triggered his transformation in the past and is willing to become the Hulk to deal with menacing threats. Betty leaves her husband and returns to Ramon, but then changes her mind and abandons Ramon as well. She is then captured by the Leader, who sets her free after learning that she is pregnant with Banner&#x27;s child, but after being tormented with terrible nightmares by the demons Nightmare and D&#x27;Spayre, Betty loses her unborn baby.

She is eventually reunited with Banner, but soon afterward the Hulk is seemingly killed in an explosion at Gammatown. Believing Banner and the Hulk dead, Betty leaves for New York City, where she eventually begins training to become a nun. Betty spends some months in a convent to recover from the ordeal, but eventually reunites with Banner. They spend years living together as fugitives until the Hulk&#x27;s enemy the Abomination uses his own blood to poison Betty, which would appear to be the work of the Hulk himself. Betty is placed in cryogenic suspension by her father.

In a later story arc, Betty is seemingly revived by the Leader, undergoes surgery which considerably alters her appearance, is granted superhuman strength, and adopts the alias &quot;Mr. Blue&quot;. However, this is later revealed to be a hallucination created by Nightmare.

===Becoming the Red She-Hulk===
During the &quot;Fall of the Hulks&quot; storyline, Betty Ross is revealed to have been resurrected by the Leader and MODOK at the urgings of Thunderbolt Ross. She also underwent the same process that had turned her father into the Red Hulk, which granted her superhuman physical power. The now-villainous Doc Samson also helps the Leader brainwash Betty into an extremely confused and aggressive state. Ross&#x27; allies, aware of his intentions to betray them, send Betty, as the &quot;Red She-Hulk&quot;, to help assassinate her father, who is hunting Domino, after she witnesses him transform from his human form. Their encounter ends with the Red She-Hulk kicking the Red Hulk off the Empire State Building.

After Ross fakes his own death, Betty also appears as herself at his &quot;funeral&quot;, accompanied by a Life Model Decoy of Glenn Talbot to constantly monitor and control her, and expresses distrust of Bruce due to his recent marriage to Caiera on Sakaar and his subsequent attack on Manhattan.

During the &quot;World War Hulks&quot; storyline, after Skaar stabs her with his sword, the Red She-Hulk reverts to her human form, exposing her true identity. Betty explains how she was brought back to life, and asks that Bruce allow her to die. But when Samson arrives, Betty&#x27;s anger at his betrayal transforms her back into the Red She-Hulk, thus healing her injuries. Now once again in control of her own mind, Betty (as the Red She-Hulk) helps Bruce/the Hulk to reconcile with his son Skaar. When Bruce gains the upper hand in the ensuing final battle against Ross, Betty becomes worried for her father, which, combined with her heightened aggression when transformed, leads to conflict with the original She-Hulk, who prevails. After Ross is defeated and imprisoned, Betty convinces Bruce to grant her father an opportunity for rehabilitation and redemption.

In the aftermath of the Leader&#x27;s attempted takeover, Betty tells Bruce that they are no longer married, since she was declared legally dead and everyone else knows that Bruce had married Caiera. But in the last series, the Hulk family defeats Fin Fang Foom. Afterwards, Betty and Bruce resume their romantic relationship, but it gets shaky as Bruce becomes obsessed with regaining the power of the Hulk.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, the Red She-Hulk travelled to Brazil, along with Spider-Woman, Ms. Marvel, and the Protector, to fight the Hulk, who was transformed into Nul: Breaker of Worlds. She later receives an enchanted Asgardian sword from Iron Man and joins the heroes in the final battle against the Serpent and his forces. After the battle, the Stark-Asgardian weapons were returned to Asgard to be melted down, but the Red She-Hulk kept her sword.

Following the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, the Hulk persona emerges as the result of an attempt to assassinate Bruce and efforts to save his life using the Extremis virus. This new Hulk, calling himself &quot;Doc Green&quot;, decides that gamma-powered superhumans are a threat to humanity that must be eliminated, with Betty being among his victims.

During the &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Betty Ross was among those who learned about Bruce Banner&#x27;s death and attended his funeral.

===Becoming the Harpy again===
In &quot;The Immortal Hulk&quot;, Bruce Banner visits Betty after his resurrection and explains that he had not contacted her for months due to emotional turmoil. As they talked, they were being watched by Bushwacker, an agent of the U.S. Hulk Operations, who had orders to monitor Bruce and possibly kill him. Though the Bushwacker was ordered by General Reginald Fortean not to shoot, he ignored the order and fired his gun. However, he unintentionally hit Betty in the head. Bruce transformed into the Hulk and went after the Bushwacker, but the Hulk was held off by Doc Samson, allowing the Bushwacker to escape. When the Hulk and Samson returned to her house, her body was missing. It was later revealed that she was transformed into a red version of the Harpy.

==Powers and abilities==
===The Harpy===
As the Harpy, Betty had superhuman strength, stamina, speed and durability with which were even enough to fight the Hulk. She also had big bird-like wings from her back that she used to fly at high speeds through the air and perform aerial attacks. In addition, she could project blasts of nuclear energy she called &quot;hellbolts&quot; from her hands and had razor-sharp talons which were strong enough to cut through metal or carry heavy objects.

===The Red She-Hulk===
As the Red She-Hulk, Betty possesses immense superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability, and a healing factor that allows her to easily survive what would normally be fatal injuries to humans, such as stab wounds to the leg and abdomen by Wolverine&#x27;s claws. Similar to her ex-husband, Betty&#x27;s strength level is so vast that it warps the laws of physics even further than standard for other characters in the same fictional continuity; for example, allowing her to punch her way through dimensional barriers between different universes. However, she was defeated easily by the original She-Hulk, mainly due to her lack of experience. She shares the Red Hulk&#x27;s ability to absorb energy, such as the gamma radiation from other gamma mutates, thereby reverting those beings to human form, and at least temporarily boosting herself. According to Banner, there were plans to remove this ability through the same process that removed the Red Hulk&#x27;s based on the fact that this ability would eventually kill her. Also like her father, the Red She-Hulk has yellow blood, produces yellow energy from her eyes when angry, and can discharge energy by touch. The Red She-Hulk can be returned to human form if she is suddenly startled or frightened, though she can revert to her Red She-Hulk form at will. As the Red She-Hulk, she still maintains control of her humanity, though if extremely angered she can become &quot;pure Hulk&quot;, further increasing her strength, but losing control of her mind.

The Red She-Hulk carries a great sword that she affectionately calls her &quot;big ass sword&quot;. The sword, forged by Tony Stark, is made of Stark Industries repulsor technology and enchanted uru metal from Asgard and was first given to the Red She-Hulk during the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, along with similar weapons given to other heroes to defeat Cul &quot;the Serpent&quot;, Odin&#x27;s long-forgotten brother. While the other weapons are eventually returned and melted at the end of the storyline, the Red She-Hulk manages to hold on to hers. The sword is later taken by a massive global machine called &quot;the Terranometer&quot; during the &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot; story arc and is held there until the Red She-Hulk is able to stop the U.S. government from inadvertently creating a dystopian future in which gamma-enhanced super-soldiers take over Earth.

<doc id="858344" wikidata="Q924194" url="?curid=858344" title="Historical European martial arts">
<text>Historical European martial arts (HEMA) are martial arts of European origin, particularly using arts formerly practised, but having since died out or evolved into very different forms.

While there is limited surviving documentation of the martial arts of classical antiquity (such as Greek wrestling or gladiatorial combat), most of the surviving dedicated technical treatises or martial arts manuals date to the late medieval period and the early modern period. For this reason, the focus of HEMA is &quot;de facto&quot; on the period of the half-millennium of ca. 1300 to 1800, with a German, Italian, and Spanish school flowering in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance (14th to 16th centuries), followed by French, English, and Scottish schools of fencing in the modern period (17th and 18th centuries).

Martial arts of the 19th century such as classical fencing, and even early hybrid styles such as Bartitsu, may also be included in the term HEMA in a wider sense, as may traditional or folkloristic styles attested in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including forms of folk wrestling and traditional stick-fighting methods.

The term Western martial arts (WMA) is sometimes used in the United States and in a wider sense including modern and traditional disciplines. During the Late Middle Ages, the longsword had a position of honour among these disciplines, and sometimes historical European swordsmanship (HES) is used to refer to swordsmanship techniques specifically.

== History of European martial arts ==
=== Ancient history ===
The earliest Western book about the fighting arts currently known (c. 2025), , was written into Latin by a Roman writer, Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, who lived in Rome between the fourth and fifth centuries. There are no other known Western martial arts manuals predating the Late Middle Ages (except for fragmentary instructions on Greek wrestling, see Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 466), although medieval literature (e.g., sagas of Icelanders, Eastern Roman Acritic songs, the &quot;Digenes Akritas&quot; and Middle High German epics) record specific martial deeds and military knowledge; in addition, historical artwork depicts combat and weaponry (e.g., the Bayeux Tapestry, the &quot;Synopsis of Histories&quot; by John Skylitzes, the Morgan Bible). Some researchers have attempted to reconstruct older fighting methods such as Pankration, Eastern Roman hoplomachia, Viking swordsmanship and gladiatorial combat by reference to these sources and practical experimentation.

The Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (also known as the &quot;Walpurgis&quot; or &quot;Tower &quot;), dated to , is the oldest surviving , teaching sword and buckler combat.

=== Post-classical history ===
The central figure of late medieval martial arts, at least in Germany, is . Though no manuscript written by him is known to have survived, his teachings were first recorded in the late 14th-century . From the 15th to the 17th century, numerous (German &#x27;fencing-books&#x27;) were produced, of which some several hundred are extant; a great many of these describe methods descended from Liechtenauer&#x27;s. Liechtenauer&#x27;s (recital) remains one of the most famous — if cryptic — pieces of European martial arts scholarship to this day, with several translations and interpretations of the poem being put into practice by fencers and scholars around the world.
Normally, several modes of combat were taught alongside one another, typically unarmed grappling ( or ), dagger ( or , often of the rondel dagger), long knife (), or Dusack, half- or quarterstaff, polearms, longsword (, , ), and combat in plate armour ( or ), both on foot and on horseback. Some have sections on dueling shields (), special weapons used only in trial by combat.

Important 15th century German fencing masters include Sigmund Ringeck, Peter von Danzig (see Cod. 44 A 8), Hans Talhoffer and Paulus Kal, all of whom taught the teachings of Liechtenauer. From the late 15th century, there were &quot;brotherhoods&quot; of fencers (), most notably the Brotherhood of St. Mark (attested 1474) and the Federfechter.

An early Burgundian French treatise is (&quot;The Play of the Axe&quot;) of ca. 1400.

The earliest master to write in the Italian language was , commissioned by the Marquis di Ferrara. Between 1407 and 1410, he documented comprehensive fighting techniques in a treatise entitled covering grappling, dagger, arming sword, longsword, pole-weapons, armoured combat, and mounted combat. The Italian school is continued by Filippo Vadi (1482–1487) and Pietro Monte (1492, Latin with Italian and Spanish terms).

Three early (before George Silver) natively English swordplay texts exist, but are all very obscure and from uncertain dates; they are generally thought to belong to the latter half of the 15th century.

=== Early modern period ===
==== Renaissance ====

In the 16th century, compendia of older techniques were produced, some of them printed, notably by Paulus Hector Mair (in the 1540s) and by Joachim Meyer (in the 1570s). The extent of Mair&#x27;s writing is unmatched by any other German master, and is considered invaluable by contemporary scholars.

In Germany, fencing had developed sportive tendencies during the 16th century. The treatises of Paulus Hector Mair and Joachim Meyer derived from the teachings of the earlier centuries within the Liechtenauer tradition, but with new and distinctive characteristics. The printed of Jacob Sutor (1612) is one of the last in the German tradition.

In Italy, the 16th century was a period of big change. It opened with the two treatises of Bolognese masters Antonio Manciolino and Achille Marozzo, who described a variation of the eclectic knightly arts of the previous century. From sword and buckler to sword and dagger, sword alone to two-handed sword, from polearms to wrestling (though absent in Manciolino), early 16th-century Italian fencing reflected the versatility that a martial artist of the time was supposed to have achieved.

Towards the mid-16th century, however, polearms and companion weapons besides the dagger and the cape gradually began to fade out of treatises. In 1553, Camillo Agrippa was the first to define the prima, seconda, terza, and quarta guards (or hand-positions), which would remain the mainstay of Italian fencing into the next century and beyond. From the late 16th century, Italian rapier fencing attained considerable popularity all over Europe, notably with the treatise by Salvator Fabris (1606).

==== Baroque style ====

During the Baroque period, wrestling fell from favour among the upper classes, being now seen as unrefined and rustic. The fencing styles practice also needed to conform to the new ideals of elegance and harmony.

This ideology was taken to great lengths in Spain in particular, where &#x27;the true art (of swordsmanship)&#x27; was now based on Renaissance humanism and scientific principles, contrasting with the traditional &quot;vulgar&quot; approach to fencing inherited from the medieval period. Significant masters of Destreza included Jerónimo Sánchez de Carranza (&quot;the father of Destreza&quot;, d. 1600) and Luis Pacheco de Narváez (1600, 1632). Girard Thibault (1630) was a Dutch master influenced by these ideals.

The French school of fencing also moves away from its Italian roots, developing its own terminology, rules and systems of teaching. French masters of the Baroque period include Le Perche du Coudray (1635, 1676, teacher of Cyrano de Bergerac), Besnard (1653, teacher of Descartes), François Dancie (1623) and Philibert de la Touche (1670).
In the 17th century, Italian swordsmanship was dominated by Salvator Fabris, whose of 1606 exerted great influence not only in Italy, but also in Germany, where it all but extinguished the native German traditions of fencing. Fabris was followed by Italian masters such as Nicoletto Giganti (1606), Ridolfo Capo Ferro (1610), Francesco Alfieri (1640), Francesco Antonio Marcelli (1686) and Bondi&#x27; di Mazo (1696).

The Elizabethan and Jacobean eras produce English fencing writers, such as the Gentleman George Silver (1599) and the professional fencing master Joseph Swetnam (1617). The English verb &quot;to fence&quot; is first attested in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1597).

The French school of fencing originated in the 16th century, which is based on the Italian school, and developed into its classical form during the Baroque period.

==== Rococo style ====

In the 18th century, during the late Baroque and Rococo period, the French style of fencing with the small sword and later with the foil (), originated as a training weapon for small sword fencing.

By 1715, the rapier had been largely replaced by the lighter and handier small sword throughout most of Europe, although treatments of the former continued to be included by authors such as Donald McBane (1728), P. J. F. Girard (1736) and Domenico Angelo (1763).

In this time, bare-knuckle boxing emerged as a popular sport in England and Ireland. The foremost pioneers of the sport of boxing were Englishmen James Figg and Jack Broughton.

Throughout the course of the 18th century, the French school became the western European standard to the extent that Angelo, an Italian-born master teaching in England, published his in French in 1763. It was extremely successful and became a standard fencing manual over the following 50 years, throughout the Napoleonic period. Angelo&#x27;s text was so influential that it was chosen to be included under the heading of in the of Diderot.

=== Late modern period ===
==== Development into modern sports ====

In the 19th century, Western martial arts became divided into modern sports on one-handed fencing and applications that retain military significance on the other. In the latter category are the methods of close-quarter combat with the bayonet, besides use of the sabre and the lance by cavalrists and of the cutlass by naval forces. The English longbow is another European weapon that is still used in the sport of archery.

Apart from the many styles of fencing, European combat sports of the 19th century include Boxing in England, Savate in France, and regional forms of wrestling such as Cumberland and Westmorland Wrestling, Lancashire Wrestling, and Cornish Wrestling.

Fencing in the 19th century transformed into a pure sport. While duels remained common among members of the aristocratic classes, they became increasingly frowned upon in society during the course of the century, and such duels as were fought to the death were increasingly fought with pistols, instead of bladed weapons.

==== Stick fighting ====
Styles of stick fighting include walking-stick fighting (including Irish or , French and English singlestick) and Bartitsu (an early hybrid of Eastern and Western schools popularized at the turn of the 20th century).

Some existing forms of European stick fighting can be traced to direct teacher-student lineages from the 19th century. Notable examples include the methods of Scottish and British Armed Services singlestick, and , Portuguese , Italian or , and some styles of Canarian .

In the 19th century and early 20th century, the greatstick (//) was employed by some Portuguese, French, and Italian military academies as a method of exercise, recreation, and as preparation for bayonet training.

A third category might be traditional &quot;folk styles&quot;, mostly folk wrestling. Greco-Roman wrestling was a discipline at the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. Inclusion of freestyle wrestling followed in 1904.

==== 19th century revival ====

Attempts at reconstructing the discontinued traditions of European systems of combat began in the late 19th century, with a revival of interest from the Middle Ages. The movement was led in England by the soldier, writer, antiquarian, and swordsman, Alfred Hutton.

Hutton learned fencing at the school founded by Domenico Angelo. In 1862, he organized in his regiment stationed in India the Cameron Fencing Club, for which he prepared his first work, a 12-page booklet entitled &quot;Swordsmanship&quot;.

After returning home from India in 1865, Hutton focused on the study and revival of older fencing systems and schools. He began tutoring groups of students in the art of &#x27;ancient swordplay&#x27; at a club attached to the London Rifle Brigade School of Arms in the 1880s. In 1889, Hutton published his most influential work &quot;Cold Steel: A Practical Treatise on the Sabre&quot;, which presented the historical method of military sabre use on foot, combining the 18th century English backsword with the modern Italian duelling sabre.

Hutton&#x27;s pioneering advocacy and practice of historical fencing included reconstructions of the fencing systems of several historical masters including George Silver and Achille Marozzo. He delivered numerous practical demonstrations with his colleague Egerton Castle of these systems during the 1890s, both in order to benefit various military charities and to encourage patronage of the contemporary methods of competitive fencing. Exhibitions were held at the Bath Club and a fund-raising event was arranged at Guy&#x27;s Hospital.
Among his many acolytes were Egerton Castle, Captain Carl Thimm, Colonel Cyril Matthey, Captain Percy Rolt, Captain Ernest George Stenson Cooke, Captain Frank Herbert Whittow, Esme Beringer, Sir Frederick, and Walter Herries Pollock. Despite this revival and the interest that was received in late Victorian England, the practice died out soon after the death of Hutton in 1910. Interest in the physical application of historical fencing techniques remained largely dormant during the first half of the 20th century, due to a number of factors.

Similar work, although more academic than practical in nature, occurred in other European countries. In Germany, Karl Wassmannsdorf conducted research on the German school and Gustav Hergsell reprinted three of Hans Talhoffer&#x27;s manuals. In France, there was the work of the Academie D&#x27;Armes circa 1880–1914. In Italy, Jacopo Gelli and Francesco Novati published a facsimile of the &quot;Flos Duellatorum&quot; of Fiore dei Liberi, and Giuseppe Cerri&#x27;s book on the Bastone drew inspiration from the two-handed sword of Achille Marozzo. Baron Leguina&#x27;s bibliography of Spanish swordsmanship is still a standard reference today.

==== 20th century ====
Starting in 1966, the Society for Creative Anachronism, an amateur medieval reenactment organization, renewed public interest in the practice of historic fighting arts, and has hosted numerous tournaments in which participants compete in simulated medieval and renaissance fighting styles using padded weapons. Dividing their focus between Heavy Armored Fighting, to simulate early medieval warfare, and adapted sport Rapier fencing, to reenact later renaissance styles, the SCA regularly holds large re-creation scenarios throughout the world. Their styles have been criticized by other groups as lacking historical authenticity, although a number of members of the group regularly engage in scholarship.

A number of researchers, principally academics with access to some of the sources, continued exploring the field of historical European martial arts from a largely academic perspective. In 1972, James Jackson published a book called &quot;Three Elizabethan Manuals of Fence&quot;. This work reprinted the works of George Silver, Giacomo di Grassi, and Vincentio Saviolo. In 1965, Martin Wierschin published a bibliography of German fencing manuals, along with a transcription of Codex Ringeck and a glossary of terms. In turn, this led to the publication of Hans-Peter Hils&#x27; seminal work on Johannes Liechtenauer in 1985.

During the mid-20th century, a small number of professional fight directors for theatre, film and television – notably including Arthur Wise. William Hobbs and John Waller, all of them British – studied historical combat treatises as inspiration for their fight choreography.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Patri J. Pugliese began making photocopies of historical treatises available to interested parties, greatly spurring on research. In 1994, with the rise of the Hammerterz Forum, a publication devoted entirely to the history of swordsmanship. During the late 1990s, translations and interpretations of historical sources began appearing in print as well as online.

== The modern HEMA community ==

Since the 1980s and 1990s, historical European martial arts communities have emerged in Europe, North America, Australia, and the wider English-speaking world. These groups attempt to reconstruct historical European martial arts using various training methods. Although the focus generally is on the martial arts of medieval and Renaissance masters, 19th- and early 20th-century martial arts teachers are also studied and their systems are reconstructed, including Edward William Barton-Wright, the founder of Bartitsu; combat savate and stick fighting master Pierre Vigny; London-based boxer and fencer Rowland George Allanson-Winn; French journalist and self-defence enthusiast Jean Joseph-Renaud; and British quarterstaff expert Thomas McCarthy.

=== Research and publications ===
Research into the rapier style of the innovative Roman, Neapolitan and Sicilian School of Fencing in Italy&#x27;s 16th and 17th century was pioneered by M° Francesco Lodà, PhD, founder of Accademia Romana d&#x27;Armi in Rome, Italy. While research focused on the Marcelli family of fencing masters and their pupils in Rome and abroad (e.g. Mattei, Villardita, Marescalchi, De Greszy, Terracusa), through publication of papers and books on rapier fencing, attention was also paid to the influences of 16th century&#x27;s masters active in Rome, such as Agrippa, Cavalcabò, Paternoster, or of the early 17th like D&#x27;Alessandri. Within Accademia Romana d&#x27;Armi historical research has continuously been carried out also on Fiore de&#x27; Liberi&#x27;s longsword system, publishing the first Italian analysis and transcription of MS. Par. Lat. 11269, Radaelli&#x27;s military saber and MS. I.33 sword and buckler, and more recently on Liechtenauer&#x27;s tradition of fencing.

Research into Italian sword forms and their influence on the French styles of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries has been undertaken by Rob Runacres of England&#x27;s Renaissance Sword Club.

Italian traditions are mainly investigated in Italy by Sala d&#x27;Arme Achille Marozzo, where you can find studies dedicated to the Bolognese tradition, to the Italian medieval tradition by Luca Cesari and Marco Rubboli, and to the Florentine tradition by Alessandro Battistini. Central and Southern Italian traditions are also investigated by Accademia Romana d&#x27;Armi, through the studies of Francesco Lodà on Spetioli (Marche) and Pagano (Neaples). Italian rapier instructors Tom Leoni (US) and Piermarco Terminiello (UK) have published annotated English translations of some of the most important rapier treatises of the 17th century, making this fencing style available to a worldwide audience. Leoni has also authored English translations of all of Fiore de&#x27; Liberi&#x27;s Italian-language manuscripts, as well as Manciolino&#x27;s &quot;Opera Nova&quot; and the third book of Viggiani&#x27;s &quot;Lo Schermo&quot;. Ken Mondschein, one of the few professional academics working in this field, translated Camillo Agrippa&#x27;s treatise of 1553 as well as the Paris manuscript of Fiore dei Liberi and written several academic articles.

The martial traditions of the Netherlands are researched by Reinier van Noort, who additionally focuses on German and French martial sources of the 17th century.

The ongoing study of the Germanic Langes Messer is most notably represented by the work of Jens Peter Kleinau and Martin Enzi. Dierk Hagedorn has also published significant translations.

Leading researchers on Manuscript I.33&#x27;s style of fence include Roland Warzecha, at the head of the Dimicator fencing school in Germany.

Other fencing traditions are represented in the scholarship of Stephen Hand and Paul Wagner of Australia&#x27;s Stoccata School of Defence, focusing on a range of systems, ranging from the works of George Silver and the techniques depicted in the Royal Armouries&#x27; Manuscript I.33 to the surviving evidence for how large shields were used, rapier according to Saviolo and Swetnam and Scottish Highland broadsword.

Christian Henry Tobler is one of the earliest researchers on the German school of swordsmanship.

Early publications also included books by Terry Brown, John Clements, David M. Cvet (self-published in 2001). In 2003, Stephen Hand edited a collection of scholarly papers titled SPADA, followed by a second volume in 2005. Since the mid-2000s, the rate of publication of HEMA related texts has greatly increased. A list of current publications is included below.

=== Events ===
Since 1998, Sala d&#x27;Arme Achille Marozzo has organized an annual championship in Italy. Due to the excessive number of participants, in 2011 this competitive event was split in two separate events: military weapons (in autumn) and civil weapons (in spring), extending the organization in a larger coalition of Italian HEMA clubs. Civilian weapons include single sword, sword and cape, sword and dagger, and sword and Brocchiero (Buckler). The military weapons are the two-handed sword, spear, shield and spear, sword and targe, and sword and rotella. The civil weapons championship is one of the largest HEMA tournaments in the world.

Since 1999, a number of HEMA groups have held the Western Martial arts Workshop (WMAW) in the United States. In 2000, The Association for Renaissance Martial Arts (ARMA), then known as the &quot;Historical Armed Combat Association&quot; (HACA), hosted the Inaugural Swordplay Symposium International conference bringing together many of the then leading researchers from the US, Europe and Australia. Since 2003, ARMA has held the ARMA International Gathering every two to three years. The Fiore-oriented Schola Saint George has hosted a Medieval Swordsmanship Symposium annually in the United States since 2001.

The annual Australian Historical Swordplay Convention, primarily a teaching event was hosted and attended by diverse Australian groups from 1999 to 2006. It was held in Brisbane in 1999 and 2006, Sydney in 2000 and 2004, Canberra in 2001 and 2005, the Gold Coast in 2003 and Melbourne in 2004. Since 2009, Swordplay, a tournament event has been run each year in Brisbane.

Since 2002, Royal Arts Fencing Academy and the Rose &amp; Gold foundation have hosted Ascalon Sword Festival, one of the largest HEMA tournaments in the United States. The event covers Olympic fencing, as well as the HEMA disciplines of longsword, rapier and dagger, military saber, and Harnisfechten. It was originally part of the larger Arnold Sports Festival as the Arnold Fencing Classic.

Since 2004, FightCamp has been running and it is organized by London-based Schola Gladiatoria.

Since 2006, a Swedish annual event called Swordfish has been taking place every year in Gothenburg, hosted by the Gothenburg Historical Fencing School (GHFS). It is currently one of the biggest HEMA tournaments in the world and is generally considered to be the &quot;world cup of HEMA&quot;.

Since 2006, a Canadian event called Nordschlag has been taking place annually in Edmonton, Alberta, hosted by The Academy of European Swordsmanship (The AES). It is Canada&#x27;s first interprovincial tournament, and currently largest Canadian tournament, and has participants from all over Western Canada. The event also includes a full day workshop that features international and local instructors.

Since 2010, The annual Pacific Northwest HEMA Gathering has been hosted by multiple schools and clubs in the Pacific Northwest. The tournament includes longsword, singlestick, glima, and one rotating weapon which is changed every year. The location of the event changes every year, and has been located at Fort Casey and Pacific Lutheran University.

Since 2011, a biannual event called the Vancouver International Swordplay Symposium, has been held in Vancouver, Canada. Hosted by Academie Duello, this event has brought instructors, authors and researchers from around the world for workshops, lectures and seminars.

Since 2012, the annual event SoCal Sword Fight has been hosted in Southern California. The event includes tournaments and classes in a variety of historical weapons, including some non-european weapons. In February 2023, the event had 329 registered fighters and over 500 participants.

Since 2013, an annual event, Fechtschule Edinburgh, an event focusing on 16th century Fencing has been hosted in Edinburgh, UK, by the Stork&#x27;s Beak: School of Historical Swordplay. This Event has attracted many practitioners from around the world.

Since 2014, the Purpleheart Armoury Open has been held in Houston, TX. Formerly Fechtshule America, the Purpleheart Armoury Open is one of the largest and fastest growing HEMA competitions in North America.

In 2015, Australia&#x27;s Stoccata School of Defence hosted a revival of the World Broadsword Championship in Sydney, Australia. This event, held throughout the late 19th century in England, the United States and Australia was last won by Parker in Sydney in 1891. Parker was never challenged. The 2015 event was won by Paul Wagner of Sydney, also the current holder of the Glorianna Cup, the broadsword championship of Britain. Lewis Hand of Hobart, Australia won the junior title. In the tradition of the 19th century title, the championship is held in the home town of the current Champion. As such the next championship will be held in Sydney in early 2017.

Jousting tournaments have become more common, with Jousters travelling Internationally to compete. These include a number organised by an expert in the Joust, Arne Koets, including The Grand Tournament of Sankt Wendel and The Grand Tournament at Schaffhausen

Another type of event that is becoming more common is the sparring camp/fight camp. These events are often more casual than tournaments, with events and competitions not typical of more formal tournaments, and an emphasis on classes and sparring.

=== Umbrella groups ===
In 1998, the British Federation for Historical Swordplay was established as an umbrella organisation for UK groups.

In 2001, the Historical European Martial Arts Coalition (HEMAC) was created to act as an umbrella organization for groups in Europe, with 4 sets of goals:
;Martial: reconstruct historical martial arts from primary sources; refine interpretations into viable, effective martial arts; test martial skills in a variety of competitive environments
;Research: locate, transcribe, translate primary sources; have a better understanding of the socio-historical context of the arts
;Outreach: promote and publicise HEMA; dispel misconceptions &amp; stereotypes; educate the general public
;Community: establish a network of individuals and groups devoted to HEMA; foster close friendships and a sense of community among members; organise at least one annual HEMAC event. Since 2002, HEMAC has organized the annual &quot;International Historical European Martial arts Gathering&quot; in Dijon, France.

In 2003, the Australian Historical Swordplay Federation became the umbrella organization for groups in Australia.

In 2010, several dozen HEMA schools and clubs from around the world united under the umbrella of the HEMA Alliance, a US-based martial arts federation dedicated to developing and sharing the Historical European Martial Arts and assisting HEMA schools and instructors with such things as instructor certification, insurance, and equipment development.

In 2012, Ruth García Navarro and Mariana López Rodríguez started Esfinges, an umbrella affinity group for women in or interested in HEMA. The goal of Esfinges is to encourage more participation of underrepresented genders in HEMA, and to support those already practicing the discipline.

<doc id="858346" wikidata="Q1931310" url="?curid=858346" title="Michio Kushi">
<text>(May 17, 1926 – December 28, 2014) was a Japanese educator and alternative cancer treatment advocate who helped to introduce modern macrobiotics to the United States in the early 1950s. He lectured all over the world at conferences and seminars about the macrobiotic diet.

==Background==
After World War II, Kushi studied in Japan with macrobiotic educator, George Ohsawa. After coming to America in 1949, Michio Kushi and Aveline Kushi, his wife, founded Erewhon Natural Foods, the &quot;East West Journal&quot;, the East West Foundation, the Kushi Foundation, One Peaceful World, and the Kushi Institute. They wrote over 70 books.

Kushi studied law and international relations at the University of Tokyo, and after coming to America, he continued his studies at Columbia University in New York City. Aveline preceded him in death (2001), as did their daughter (1995). Michio Kushi lived in Brookline, Massachusetts. He died of pancreatic cancer on December 28, 2014, at the age of 88.

==Achievements==

* 1994 Kushi received the Award of Excellence from the United Nations Society of Writers.
*1999 Mentioned in the Congressional record in recognition of the dedication and hard work to educate the world about the benefits of a macrobiotic diet.
*1999 The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History opened a permanent collection on macrobiotics and alternative health care in his name. The title of the collection is the &quot;Michio and Aveline Kushi Macrobiotics Collection&quot;. It is located in the Archives Center.

Michio and his first wife Aveline were founders of The Kushi Institute, located in Becket, Massachusetts through 2016, but formerly in a converted factory building in Brookline Village, Massachusetts, adjacent to Mission Hill, Boston.

He and his first wife were awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for their &quot;extraordinary contribution to diet, health, and world peace, and for serving as powerful examples of conscious living&quot;, on October 14, 2000.

==Cancer==

Kushi argued that conventional cancer treatments are &quot;violent and artificial&quot; and promoted his macrobiotic diet to treat cancer. There is no clinical evidence that the macrobiotic diet is effective to treat cancer. The American Cancer Society asked Kushi for documentation of his cancer claims. The reply contained no clinical data. 

Nutritionists have criticized Kushi&#x27;s claim that a macrobiotic diet can cure cancer. Elizabeth Whelan and Frederick J. Stare have noted that:

Kushi&#x27;s claim that cancer is largely due to his own versions of improper diet, thinking, and lifestyle is entirely without foundation. In his books, Kushi has recounted numerous case histories of persons whose cancer allegedly disappeared after following a macrobiotic diet. There are no available statistics on the outcome for all of these patients, but it is documented that at least some of them succumbed to their disease within a relatively short period. Reported testimonials of remission often uncovered the fact that the patients were also receiving conventional medical treatment at the same time.

<text>Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume (; ) is a commune in the southeastern French department of Var, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region. Located east of Aix-en-Provence, the town lies at the foot of the Sainte-Baume mountains. &quot;Baume&quot; or &quot;bama&quot; is the Provençal equivalent of &quot;cave&quot;. The town&#x27;s basilica is dedicated to Mary Magdalene.

==History==
The Roman Villa Lata, remains of which have been identified beneath Place Malherbe in the centre of the town, was one among numerous agricultural working Roman villas in the plain that was traversed by the via Aurelia. The Abbey of Saint Victor at Marseille had dependencies in the neighborhood: Saint-Maximin, Saint-Jean, Saint-Mitre, Sainte-Marie. The Romanesque parish church dedicated to Saint Maximin of Trier was demolished in the final stages of constructing the basilica.

In the 12th century, Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Provence, established Saint-Maximin as a town uniquely under his care. In 1246, following the death of Raymond IV Berenger, Provence passed through his younger daughter to Charles d&#x27;Anjou, brother of Louis IX of France and sometime king of Sicily. The tenuous Anjou presence at Saint-Maximin was fiercely contested by the seigneurs of Baux among other local leaders.

The French baritone Louis Gassier (1820–1871) was born in Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume.

==The &quot;cultus&quot; of Mary Magdalene==
The little town was transformed by the well-published discovery on 12 December 1279, in the crypt of Saint-Maximin, of a sarcophagus that was proclaimed to be the tomb of Mary Magdalene, signaled by miracles and by the ensuing pilgrim-drawing cult of Mary Magdalene and Saint Maximin, that was assiduously cultivated by Charles II of Anjou, King of Naples. He founded the massive Gothic in 1295 with the blessing of Boniface VIII, who placed it under the new teaching order of Dominicans.

The founding tradition held that relics of Mary Magdalene were preserved here, and not at Vézelay, and that she, her brother Lazarus, and a certain Maximinus fled the Holy Land by a miraculous boat with neither rudder nor sail and landed at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, in the Camargue near Arles. Maximinus is venerated as St Maximin, a name shared by the 3rd-century Maximin of Trier and the 1st-century martyr, Maximinus of Aix, whom medieval legend conflated with the later Maximin; the conflated Maximin was added in the discussed medieval period to earlier lists of the Seventy Disciples.

After landing in the Camargue, Mary Magdalene came to Marseille and converted the local people. Later in life, according to the founding legend, she retired to a cave in the Sainte-Baume mountains. She was buried in Saint-Maximin, which was not a place of pilgrimage in early times, though there is a Gallo-Roman crypt under the basilica. Sarcophagi are shown, of St Maximin, Ste. Marcella, Ste. Suzanne and St. Sidoine (Sidonius) as well as the reliquary, which is said to hold the remains of Mary Magdalene. Genetic testing of some of the hairs in the reliquary confirmed that it was the hair of a woman of possible Jewish ancestry, but do not confirm the identity of the source of the hair.

Construction of the basilica began in 1295. The crypt was complete when the church was consecrated in 1316. In it were installed a fourth-century Gallo-Roman funerary monument and four marble sarcophagi, whose bas-reliefs permit a Christian identification.

The Black Death in 1348, which killed half the local population, interrupted the building campaign. It was not taken up again until 1404, and the sixth bay of the nave complete by 1412. Work continued until 1532, when it was decided to leave the basilica without a finished west front or portal or bell towers, features that it lacks to this day. The plan has a main apse flanked by two subsidiary apses. Its great aisled nave is without transept. The nave is flanked by sixteen chapels in the side-aisles.

<doc id="858353" wikidata="Q421214" url="?curid=858353" title="Acroterion">
<text>An acroterion, acroterium, (pl. akroteria) is an architectural ornament placed on a flat pedestal called the &quot;acroter&quot; or plinth, and mounted at the apex or corner of the pediment of a building in the classical style. An acroterion placed at the outer angles of the pediment is an &quot;acroterion angularium&quot; (&quot;&quot; means ‘at the corners’).

The acroterion may take a wide variety of forms, such as a statue, tripod, disc, urn, palmette or some other sculpted feature. Acroteria are also found in Gothic architecture. They are sometimes incorporated into furniture designs.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Greek &#x27; ( &#x27;summit, extremity&#x27;), from the comparative form of the adjective , (&quot;extreme&quot;, &quot;endmost&quot;) + (comparative suffix) + (substantivizing neuter form of adjectival suffix ). It was Latinized by the Romans as &#x27;. &quot;Acroteria&quot; is the plural of both the original Greek and the Latin form.

According to Webb, during the Hellenistic period the winged victory or Nike figure was considered to be &quot;the most appropriate motif for figured akroteria.”

<doc id="858357" wikidata="Q666449" url="?curid=858357" title="Korg Triton">
<text>The Korg Triton is a music workstation synthesizer, featuring digital sampling and sequencing, released in 1999. It uses Korg&#x27;s &quot;HI (Hyper Integrated) Synthesis&quot; system and was eventually available in several model variants with numerous upgrade options. The Triton became renowned as a benchmark of keyboard technology, and has been widely featured in music videos and live concerts. At the NAMM Show in 2007, Korg announced the Korg M3 as its successor.


==History and pedigree==
The Korg Triton line is considered the direct descendant of the earlier Korg Trinity line of workstations. The two ranges are aesthetically and functionally very similar. The Triton &quot;Classic&quot; followed the Trinity&#x27;s naming conventions of the Pro and Pro X being designated to models featuring 76 and 88 keys respectively (that naming system actually started with previous 01/w series, also available with 61 keys (base and -FD models), 76 (01/wPro) and 88 (01/wProX).

The original Triton introduced many improvements over the Trinity, like 62-note polyphony, dual polyphonic arpeggiators, RPPR phrase recorder, onboard sampler with expandable RAM, greatly improved effects &amp; routing possibilities (including the processing of external signals via the internal effects), larger synthesis modulation matrix, faster operating system, significantly faster touchscreen response, sample ROM expandability, enhanced UI including category search (ability to browse through related groups of sounds like pianos, brass, strings, etc.), additional audio output jacks, redesigned sequencer adding individual track looping and Cue List and significantly more event memory, more than doubled Program/Combination memory slots, more realtime controllers including knobs, portamento, and availability of multi-timbral MOSS synthesis expansion (whereas Trinity&#x27;s MOSS expansion was mono-timbral). In addition, the Triton US MSRP was $800 less than the basic Trinity. 

The biggest improvement of Triton was in the sound: new multisamples and better processing, combined with full availability of all five insert effects per Program (each equivalent to a Trinity &quot;Size 2&quot; or two &quot;Size 1&quot; effects). The HI Synthesis engine also provides dual filters per digital oscillator configurable to either a series 24dB/octave resonant low-pass setting or else a parallel 12dB/octave high-pass plus 12dB/octave low-pass combination (which together can also be used similar to band-pass filter). Further, despite the very close similarly between the Triton and Trinity synthesis engines, PCM ROM, and effects processing, Korg programmed many of the Triton preset Programs and Combinations to appeal to the contemporary pop, dance, and hip-hop genres, making full use of the new dual arpeggiators and RPPR feature. All this essentially made Triton one of the best selling synths of the 2000s (its successors M3/M50 and later Krome sound engines are essentially improved Tritons with better UI and more wave ROM). Although it lost the sequencer audio tracks, digital input and output, these options were rarely installed in the Trinity, so the difference thereof was negligible. The onboard sampler was another significant improvement, as well as the &quot;instant sequencing&quot; function found in the latest firmware versions of Triton Classic and all subsequent Tritons (which allows the user to convert a combi into a song where all parts (programs) are instantly set up as tracks within a song). The Triton Extreme added in-track sampling support, allowing stereo samples to be recorded in context with a MIDI sequence and automatic triggering of the samples at their proper locations in the sequence during playback. The Triton Classic has since been re-released by Korg as a software synth (both standalone and VST), for use in digital music production, while hardware Tritons are still widely used by gigging musicians.

==Variants==
===&quot;Classic&quot;===
The original Triton was released in 1999 and became known as the &quot;Classic&quot; or &quot;Classic 61&quot; as subsequent models were released. The options available to buyers included a MOSS board, SCSI interface, two EXB-PCM expansion boards and 64MB RAM. It had a 61-key synth-/semi-weighted keyboard.

===Pro and ProX &quot;Classic&quot;===
The &quot;Pro&quot; was a 76-key synth-/semi-weighted workstation, while the &quot;ProX&quot; was an 88-key hammer-action/full-/piano-weighted workstation. Both were otherwise identical in specification to the Classic 61.

===Triton-Rack===
The Triton-Rack was the rackmount version of the Triton. Since musicians would use it as a sound module rather than a complete workstation, requiring a separate keyboard to control it via MIDI, it was designed with different abilities. The oversized touchscreen was replaced with a smaller, more conventional 240x64-dot graphic LCD, with eight soft-keys under the LCD and cursor keys for user-interface navigation (essentially the same user interface later used in the Triton Le, Karma, and Korg TR keyboards), plus a rotary wheel and ten-key pad for data entry (like the touchscreen Tritons), while also retaining the knobs (here doing double-duty for both synthesizer and arepeggiator control) and floppy disk drive. 

Though not equipped with a keyboard, it had advantages over Triton Classic 61, Pro, and ProX models, including storage of up to eight (instead of only two) EXB-PCM ROM boards containing additional sampled waveforms, many extra sound Program and Combi memory locations, expandability to maximum 96MB sample RAM (instead of only 64MB) and featured a built-in S/PDIF digital audio output (not available on the Classics). 

Like the Classic models, the Triton-Rack featured sampling and could also support Korg&#x27;s MOSS synthesizer expansion board (EXB-MOSS), distinguishing a so-expanded Triton-Rack as the only way to obtain MOSS synthesis (essentially identical to Korg&#x27;s Z1 and extremely similar to Korg&#x27;s Prophecy) in rack-mounted form, with the additional benefit of the Triton&#x27;s seven-total effects processors (more numerous, variable, and capable than those in Z1 or Prophecy), albeit with 6-voice polyphony compared to the Z1&#x27;s 12 (or 18 with optional expansion.)

The Triton-Rack also supported the EXB-DI &quot;Digital Interface&quot; board providing ADAT output and Word Clock, or EXB-mLAN option featuring mLAN output.

===KARMA===

The Korg KARMA, released in 2001, featured the Triton synthesis technology with full effects processing, two PCM ROM expansion slots, and MOSS synthesizer expansion slot, but without both Triton&#x27;s sampling/audio-input functionality and touchscreen interface. It included the more specialised KARMA music system instead of Triton&#x27;s two programmable arpeggiators. It was only available in a 61-key version (with a lesser quality keyboard than the Triton).

===Le===
The Triton Le, released in 2002, was a stripped-down, cost-reduced version of the original Triton. It uses a smaller non-touch screen similar to the TRITON-RACK. The ribbon controller and floppy disk drive were omitted but a Smartmedia slot was instead included. A lighter and cheaper key bed than those used on the Trinity/original Triton range was installed, and the effects bus was downscaled from five insert effects to one. The MOSS, a Z1-based board, cannot be fitted on the Le. The functionality of the original sequencer and arpeggiator was retained, though. It was possible to load samples via the Smartmedia slot into the onboard sample RAM without requiring the sampling board to be fitted. 
Marketed at a much lower price than the original Triton range, the Le was a commercial success. 

A special edition of Le was released featuring a black body, visually similar but functionally different from the later TR.

Three versions of &quot;Le&quot; are available :
Triton Le 61 – 61 keys
Triton Le 76 – 76 keys
Triton Le 88 – 88 keys (RH2 Real Weighted Hammer action)

===Studio===

The &quot;Triton Studio&quot;, released in 2002, included the features of the &quot;Classic&quot; with double polyphony (although oddly split, with half polyphony dedicated to original 32MB ROM samples and sample RAM, and half to all EXB-PCM expansion sample boards including the built-in piano expansion), plus the addition of S/PDIF input and output, as well as the EXB-PCM08 piano expansion board, and some operating system enhancements. Sample RAM could be expanded to a maximum 96MB and a SCSI interface was included as standard. The instrument also had space for seven EXB-PCM sample expansion boards and could be fitted with an optional hard drive, internal CD-RW drive, EXB-DI expansion board with an ADAT interface or EXB-mLAN expansion board with mLAN interface.

===Extreme===

In 2004, Korg released the &quot;Triton Extreme&quot;, with many of the features of the Studio (such as the entire PCM ROM from the Studio model) plus the entire sample sets from Korg&#x27;s best-selling Trance Attack, Orchestral Collection, and Vintage Archives expansion boards, as well as the most popular sounds from the Dance Extreme, Studio Essentials, and Pianos/Classic Keyboards collections. PCM data not available on any other Triton models was also included such as improved pianos and acoustic guitars. The 34MB ROM of the &quot;Classic&quot; was upgraded to 160MB.

Valve Force circuitry, using a vacuum tube and an analog ultra gain transistor to allow for warmer, guitar amp-like sounds for more extreme analog overdrive/distortion sounds was included, and proved especially useful for pad and organ sounds, as well as adding depth and realism to acoustic sounds, such as piano. Unlike previous Tritons, which were a white-silver color, the Extreme was finished in dark blue, though, much like with the Korg Trinity Plus and Triton LE, there also was a Special Edition version of the Extreme with a black finish, made exclusive to only the Domestic (Japanese) Market.

Like the Triton &quot;Classic&quot; and Studio, the Triton Extreme included a touch screen interface, along with the knob and button controls. A USB interface providing both Type A and Type B connectors enabled external storage and connectivity with a PC, facilitating exchange of samples, sound programs, sequences, and other Triton-compatible files. CompactFlash and microdrive cards up to 8 GB were supported, negating the need to sample directly to RAM. The USB port also allowed control of software synths and host applications via MIDI. However, unlike the &quot;Classic&quot;, Studio, and Rack versions, the Extreme could not be fitted with sample expansion boards due to the expansion ROMs having been pre-installed. It was compatible, though, with the MOSS board and up to 96 MB of sample RAM. No SCSI, mLAN or ADAT interfaces were included but optical stereo S/PDIF inputs and outputs were installed.

The USB Type A connector can be used to connect a USB thumb drive, hard drive or CD writer drive for making music CDs and loading AKAI format sample libraries. The sequencer was upgraded to facilitate in-track sampling.

It is also seen as the keyboard of choice for Tsumugi Kotobuki in the anime &quot;K-On!&quot;.
===TR===

Released in 2006, the TR was similar to the Triton Le but included expanded ROM and additional programs and combinations. It also features a USB cable for data connection with a PC. The TR also features an SD card slot. The piano quality was also improved compared to the &quot;Classic&quot; and Le keyboards.

===X50 and MicroX===
The X50 and MicroX, released in 2007, were oriented towards the lower end of the market and were consequently less physically robust and included fewer features. They contained the same HI synthesis engine found on the TR with the basic Triton and extended ROM: the X50 maintains the same extended ROM as the TR, while the MicroX extended ROM focused more on drum and percussion samples. Neither had the sequencing or expansion capability of the TR. USB connection was available for high-speed MIDI control (and use with the included plug-in editor), but incompatibilities with the other Tritons hampered the use of libraries for those keyboards. The main difference between the two keyboards was in scale and control layout: the X50 was a 61-key keyboard with pitch and modulation wheels, while the MicroX had only 25 keys with the Triton joystick. Neither had the aftertouch functionality of the TR keyboard. Both included patch editor and librarian software as well as a plug-in for DAW control, allowing the import and export of Triton-compatible files. Similarly to the LE and TR, only one insert effect and two master effects could be assigned.

===Triton Taktile===

A USB-powered controller with the 512 programs from the original factory bank of the Classic, the Triton Taktile is offered in 25- and 49-key versions, with the same semi-weighted (though without aftertouch) keyboard used on the KROME. It includes a touch pad inherited from the Kaossilator that lets you play melodies using just a single finger, velocity-sensitive trigger pads (16 on the 49-key, 8 on the 25-key) that let you generate chords in the key and scale of your choice, an arpeggiator, ribbon controller, sliders and switches. Audio output is a stereo 1/8&quot; mini headphone jack. The onboard sounds can&#x27;t be edited, layered or split, and playback is mono‑timbral.

===Triton Classic and Extreme VSTi===
On December 26, 2019, Korg released a VSTi software version of the Classic Korg Triton, complete with all of its expansion packs, then followed it up with another VSTi Version of the Korg Triton Extreme on July 28, 2021. Both are available as part of the Korg Collection of VST software meant to replicate their previous hardware synths.

All models, except the Triton Rack, X50, Micro-X, KARMA and Taktile were available in 61, 76 and 88-key configurations. They could also be upgraded with increased sample EDO RAM and expansion boards for additional sounds. Only the Triton Le did not provide this feature. The Triton &quot;Classic&quot;, Extreme, and Studio were controlled by a touchscreen. The KARMA, Le and Rack, however, featured a more conventional display.

== Availability ==
Except for the Triton Taktile, all models of the Korg Triton model range have been discontinued by the manufacturer.
Today, the Best Of Triton Soundbanks can be found on Korg&#x27;s website as downloadable programs for the Korg Krome workstation, KORG Pa4X Professional arranger, KRONOS as well as an in app purchasable soundbank for the full version of the korg sound module for iOS. On December 26, 2019, Korg released a VST plugin replicating the Korg Triton, including all factory patches &amp; waveforms, and the full collection of EXB-PCM expansions.

<doc id="858361" wikidata="Q1645717" url="?curid=858361" title="Sydney Buxton, 1st Earl Buxton">
<text>Sydney Charles Buxton, 1st Earl Buxton, (25 October 1853 – 15 October 1934) was a radical British Liberal politician of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He also served as the second Governor-General of South Africa from 1914 to 1920.

==Background and education==
Buxton was the son of Charles Buxton and grandson of social reformer Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, 1st Baronet. His mother was Emily Mary, daughter of the physician and traveller Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet. He was born in London and educated at Clifton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was a member of the London School Board from 1876 to 1882.

==Political career==
In 1880, Buxton became prominent in political circles by the publication of his &quot;Handbook to the Political Questions of the Day&quot;, a work which eventually went through 11 editions. That same year, he ran for Parliament for Boston, but lost. However, he became an MP in 1883 by winning a by-election in Peterborough. He was defeated in the 1885 general election, but returned to Parliament the very next year, representing Poplar. He would represent this constituency in Parliament until 1914.

From 1892 to 1895, Buxton served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1905, he earned his first Cabinet post, that of Postmaster-General. In this capacity he introduced such services as penny postage to the United States, the Canadian magazine post, and cheap postage for the blind. In 1910, Buxton was named president of the Board of Trade; in this position he oversaw the passage or amendment of many trade and commerce laws. Upon the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, he asked Lord Loreburn, the Lord Chancellor, to appoint a commission of inquiry into the disaster. This commission eventually came to be headed by Lord Mersey.

In February 1914, Buxton was appointed Governor-General of South Africa, and on 11 May of that year he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Buxton, of Newtimber in the County of Sussex. A revolt by some of the South African populace on the outbreak of the First World War temporarily threatened his safety, but the country&#x27;s Prime Minister, General Louis Botha, immediately attached the Union of South Africa to Britain. Thereafter, Lord Buxton and General Botha formed an effective partnership, planning and executing South African actions in the war, including the invasion of the neighbouring German colony of South West Africa. Lord Buxton travelled widely throughout South Africa, and endeared himself to the people. Upon his retirement in 1920, the people demonstrated their affection for him. He continued his interest in South African affairs after returning to England, serving as president of the African Society from 1920 to 1933.

He was created Earl Buxton on 8 November 1920, and continued to be a member of the Liberal Party, often supporting his close friend and colleague Sir Edward Grey. In his later years, he had to undergo amputation of his leg due to a knee injury sustained earlier in his life.

He died at Newtimber on 15 October 1934.

==Marriages==
Lord Buxton was twice married, firstly in 1882 to Constance Mary Lubbock (died 1892), second daughter of John Lubbock, and secondly in 1896 to Mildred Anne Smith, elder daughter of Hugh Colin Smith, governor of the Bank of England, of Mount Clare, Roehampton, a sister of the banker Vivian Smith and of Admiral Sir Aubrey Smith, RN.

By his first wife, he had two sons and one daughter, of whom the sons both died in his lifetime. By his second wife, he had one son and two daughters, of whom the son and the elder daughter died in his lifetime.

===Issue===
By his first wife, Constance Mary Lubbock (died 3 November 1892):
*Charles Sydney Buxton (26 May 1884 – 31 August 1911); died unmarried. He proposed marriage to Octavia Wilberforce (1888–1963), a descendant of the reformer, but she refused him.
*Kenneth Sydney Buxton (4 September 1886 – 27 August 1894); died in childhood, aged seven.
*Lady Phyllis Sydney Buxton (17 April 1888 – 27 January 1942), later Phyllis Ponsonby OBE; married 23 September 1918 Rev. Canon Maurice George Jesser Ponsonby, MC, DL, JP (10 September 1880 – 27 February 1943), a grandson of The 2nd Baron De Mauley, had 5 children, of which two (Elizabeth and Mary) have descendants

By his second wife, Mildred Anne, Countess Buxton (1866–1955):
*Lady Doreen Maria Josepha Sydney Buxton (29 November 1897 – 28 July 1923), a fraternal twin; married 24 January 1918 Charles Alfred Euston Fitzroy, a scion of the Dukes of Grafton. She died aged 25, shortly after the birth of her third child. After her death, her husband remarried. His second wife, Lucy Eleanor Barnes (died 1943), was a first cousin of his first wife through her Buxton mother, in 1924. Twice widowed, he married, thirdly, in 1944. He succeeded to the dukedom in August 1936 when a young cousin, The 9th Duke of Grafton, was killed in a motoring race.
*The Hon Denis Bertram Sydney Buxton (29 November 1897 – 9 October 1917), a fraternal twin; killed in action, aged 19, Passchendaele, as a Second Lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards. At the time of his death, he was his father&#x27;s only surviving son and heir to his viscountcy. The location of his grave is unknown and he is commemorated on Panel Nine of the Tyne Cot Cemetery, a memorial bearing the names of some 35,000 men of the British and New Zealand forces who have no known grave, nearly all of whom died between August 1917 and November 1918.
*Lady Alethea Constance Dorothy Sydney Buxton (2 August 1910 – 25 July 2004); married Venerable Peter Charles Eliot, TD, MBE (30 October 1910 – 1995), son of Edward Granville Eliot (himself grandson of The 3rd Earl of St Germans) and Clare Louise Phelips, on 12 July 1934. They had no issue, and Lady Alethea died aged 93 in 2004.

Since all his sons died unmarried in his lifetime, his titles became extinct at his death. Earl Buxton was survived by his second wife Mildred (died 1955) and his youngest daughter Lady Althea Eliot (died 2004), and by eight grandchildren including the future Duke of Grafton (1919–2011).

<doc id="858363" wikidata="Q740392" url="?curid=858363" title="Sarajevo International Airport">
<text>Sarajevo International Airport () () () is the main international airport in Bosnia and Herzegovina, serving Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located southwest of the Sarajevo railway station and some west of downtown Sarajevo in the Ilidža municipality, suburb of Butmir. In 2024, 1,821,762 passengers travelled through the airport, compared to 323,499 in 2001.

==History==
===Early years===
First regular flights to Sarajevo using an airfield in the suburb of Butmir begin in 1930 when the domestic airline Aeroput opened a regular route linking Belgrade to Podgorica via Sarajevo. A year later, Aeroput opened a new route which linked Belgrade and Zagreb via Sarajevo, Split, and Rijeka. In 1935, Aeroput operated three times weekly the non-stop route Belgrade – Sarajevo, which was extended to Dubrovnik a year later. In 1937, Aeroput included regular flights linking Sarajevo to Zagreb, and 1938 was the year when first international flights were introduced when Aeroput extended the route Dubrovnik – Sarajevo – Zagreb to Vienna, Brno, and Prague.

The airfield in Butmir remained in use all the way until 1969. The need for a new airport in Sarajevo, with an asphalt-concrete runway, was acknowledged in the mid-1960s when JAT, Yugoslav national carrier at that time, began acquiring jet planes. The construction of the airport began in 1966 at its present location, not far from the old one.

Sarajevo Airport opened on 2 June 1969 for domestic traffic. In 1970, Frankfurt became the first international destination served. Most of the time the airport was a &#x27;feeder&#x27; airport where passengers embarked for flights to Zagreb and Belgrade on their way to international destinations. Over time, the traffic volume steadily grew from 70,000 to 600,000 passengers a year. The first renovation came for the 1984 Winter Olympics, when the runway was extended by 200 meters, the navigation system was improved, and a new terminal building was built, designed for 1 million passengers a year.

At the beginning of the Bosnian War, the airport was put under control of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). When the regular flights were stopped, the JNA evacuated some 30,000 people, mostly women and children, who were spouses and children of JNA officers fleeing the siege of Sarajevo; the first humanitarian aid from the US and France arrived in this period too. After JNA left, the airport was for a while under control of Bosnian Serb forces and in June 1992, they handed over the airport to the UN to use it for humanitarian purposes (United Nations Security Council Resolution 757). In the biggest humanitarian operation in history of the UN that followed, during the Bosnian war, some 13,000 flights were carried out and over 160,000 tons of international humanitarian aid was delivered to the besieged city of Sarajevo.

The airport re-opened to civilian air traffic on 16 August 1996 and has since been renovated and slowly restored. Since the Dayton Agreement in 1995, the airport has a commercial flight business which includes Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa, Air Serbia, Croatia Airlines, Turkish Airlines, and others.

===Development in the 2000s===
On 18 October 2005, Paddy Ashdown, the High Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, suspended a decision by Bosnian authorities to name the airport after Alija Izetbegović, the first President of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The High Representative stated that such a renaming might undermine the reconciliation process by alienating non-Bosniak citizens. In 2005, the European branch of the Airports Council International awarded Sarajevo the award of &quot;Best Airport Under 1 Million Passengers&quot;.

In 2013, Sarajevo International Airport handled 665,638 passengers which was more than all of the other airports in Bosnia and Herzegovina combined and a 14.7% increase from 2012. This was till then the highest number of passengers per year since the reopening of the airport. On 26 December 2014, the airport welcomed its 700,000th passenger on Austrian Airlines flight OS758 to Vienna.

In May 2015, work started on expansion of Sarajevo International Airport. Current work is undergoing on expansion of arrival area, adding more passport control check stands and rearranging whole arrival area to make it more passenger friendly. Next to follow is expansion of check in area which will include three more check in counters making it total of 15 check in counters. By the end of the year the airport will begin with platform expansion and the construction of rapid exit taxiway with scheduled completion by mid of the next year. 2017 should be the year in which airport will enter into the reconstruction of the runway and the maneuvering areas. Expansion of the airport at the current level is financed by Sarajevo Airport own funds. On 6 June 2015, Pope Francis visited Sarajevo arriving on an Alitalia Airbus A320-200 from Rome. Welcome ceremony was held at Sarajevo International Airport.

The airport served as the home base for the country&#x27;s flag carrier, B&amp;H Airlines, until July 2015 when the airline ceased operations. During December 2015, Sarajevo Airport experienced very low visibility and fog. About 40% of flights were canceled which impacted passengers growth and financial loss to the airport. Airport handled only 28,167 passengers of 50,000 planned (last year in December 43,079 passengers were handled). For Sarajevo International Airport one of major restrictions is a mountain terrain that requires a high approach precision and a big inclination angle in a procedure of unsuccessful approach and landing. Vlado Jurić, Head of the Office for aviation safety at Bosnia and Herzegovina Air Navigation Services Agency (BHANSA), presented the information about problems caused by reduced minimums at Sarajevo Airport. For the implementation of ILS categories (CAT II or CAT III), the terrain in front of the runway start should be free of obstacles for at least 1,000 metres. It means that the RWY 12 threshold should be moved for additional 200 metres which would reduce the runway length and as such is unacceptable. From the point of view of procedure design, the reduction of minimums is not an option and therefore it is necessary to find other solutions for improvement of landing conditions at Sarajevo Airport. The biggest problem at Sarajevo Airport is fog. The representative of Sarajevo Airport, Mr Nermin Zijadić informed that there is a relevant plan regarding this problem. He also presented the information about future projects of Sarajevo Airport among which the most important one is a reconstruction of the runway including its lighting system.

In 2016, Qatar Airways announced a new route from Doha to Sarajevo. However, the start of this service was first postponed and then moved to 10 October 2017. with four weekly flights. On 5 December 2016, the airport welcomed its 800,000th passenger on Air Serbia flight JU113 to Belgrade.

In 2017, Sarajevo International Airport welcomed six new airlines and seven destinations: AtlasGlobal (Istanbul), Wizz Air (Budapest), Wataniya Airways (Kuwait City), Nesma Airlines (Riyadh), TUI fly Belgium (Charleroi), flydubai (Dubai), Qatar Airways (Doha).

On 28 November 2017, Sarajevo International Airport received its 900,000th passenger of the year, representing a record number of passengers in one calendar year. On 5 December 2018, Sarajevo International Airport welcomed for the first time its millionth passenger of the year.

On 3 May 2017, the airport announced a major terminal expansion. The project is worth 20 million Euros and scheduled to be completed in 2020. A new, 10,000 sqm building on four levels will be built as an addition to the current terminal building. The new terminal will have capacity to handle 2 million passengers per year and will be equipped with three jet bridges. On 9 April 2019, the airport announced expansion of the VIP area into a new VIP building as part of the expansion project for the new main terminal with a separate check-in, customs and arrival section for VIP travellers. During June–July 2019, the airport saw its largest destination expansion. A total of 10 new destinations were added. FlyBosnia started flights from Sarajevo to Riyadh, Kuwait, Jeddah, Gassim, and Bahrain. Flynas started flights from Riyadh and Jeddah. Norwegian started flights from Göteborg, while Eurowings started flights from Berlin Tegel Airport. In October and November 2019, FlyBosnia started flights to London Luton and Rome Fiumicino Airport.

===2020s===
On 17 November 2020, Sarajevo International Airport terminated its contract with FlyBosnia after the company failed to repay its debts within 60 days.

On 3 February 2021, Wizz Air announced the opening of its second base in Bosnia and Herzegovina, after Tuzla; the airline will open a base at Sarajevo with one Airbus A320. The airline announced nine new European destinations from Sarajevo with 21 weekly departures. On 12 August 2021, Wizz Air has subsequently announced that it will base its second aircraft at Sarajevo International Airport. It is planned to launch 7 new routes from December 2021. Also, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi plans to introduce direct routes between Sarajevo and Abu Dhabi in October 2021. However, in September 2022, Wizz Air announced it would close its base at the airport, ending all routes except those to London and Abu Dhabi.

In 2024 Ryanair introduced six routes connecting Sarajevo with: Bergamo, Charleroi, Gothenburg, London–Stansted, Memmingen and Thessaloniki. Ryanair doubles traffic at Sarajevo for Summer 2025 with five new routes – Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport, Weeze Airport, Girona Costa Brava Airport, Paris Beauvais Airport, and Stockholm Arlanda Airport, bringing Sarajevo route network to 11 in eight countries

==Accidents and incidents==
*18 January 1977: Džemal Bijedić, then prime minister of Yugoslavia, and his wife were among the eight people killed when their Learjet 25 crashed on the Inač mountain near Kreševo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plane took off from Batajnica Air Base in Belgrade and was en route to Sarajevo when it crashed, ostensibly due to poor weather conditions. Conspiracy theorists have suggested that the crash was not an accident but rather the result of foul play at the hands of his rivals.
*31 December 1994: A Belair Ilyushin-76TD cargo plane, registration EW-76836, was operating on a flight from Luxembourg to Sarajevo on behalf of the United Nations. At the time of landing at Sarajevo airport, the runway was flooded and the aircraft overran the runway and struck a ditch with the nose gear. There were no fatalities among the 11 people onboard, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.

<doc id="858365" wikidata="Q161068" url="?curid=858365" title="Nasturtium (plant genus)">
<text>Nasturtium () is a genus of a small number of plant species in the family Brassicaceae (cabbage family) commonly known as watercress or yellowcress. The best known species are the edible &quot;Nasturtium officinale&quot; and &quot;Nasturtium microphyllum&quot;. &quot;Nasturtium&quot; was previously synonymised with &quot;Rorippa&quot;, but molecular evidence supports its maintenance as a distinct genus more closely related to &quot;Cardamine&quot; than to &quot;Rorippa&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;.

These plants are related to garden cress and mustard, noteworthy for a peppery, tangy (pungent) flavor. The name &quot;Nasturtium&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;nasus tortus&quot;, meaning &quot;twisted nose&quot;, in reference to the effect on the nasal passages of eating the plants.
&quot;Nasturtium&quot; foliage is used as food by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera, including &quot;Orthonama obstipata&quot; (The Gem).

One species, &quot;Nasturtium gambellii&quot;, is federally listed in California as an endangered species.

== Nomenclature ==
The genus &quot;Nasturtium&quot; should not be confused with the ornamental garden plant, usually grown as an annual, that is commonly known as nasturtium (&quot;Tropaeolum majus&quot;). Though not closely related, the leaves of the garden nasturtium also have a peppery taste.

== Species ==
, Plants of the World Online accepts the following species and hybrids:
*&quot;Nasturtium floridanum&quot; – Florida watercress or Florida yellowcress
*&quot;Nasturtium gambellii&quot; (orth. var. &quot;N. gambelii&quot;) – Gambel&#x27;s watercress or Gambel&#x27;s yellowcress
*&quot;Nasturtium microphyllum&quot; – onerow watercress or onerow yellowcress
*&quot;Nasturtium officinale&quot; – watercress or yellowcress
*&quot;Nasturtium&quot; × &quot;sterile&quot; – &quot;N. officinale&quot; × &quot;N. microphyllum&quot;, hybrid watercress

Plants of the World Online regards &quot;Nasturtium africanum&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Rorippa africana&quot;.

<doc id="858367" wikidata="Q2359751" url="?curid=858367" title="George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon">
<text>George Herbert Hyde Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon (7 June 1877 – 13 December 1955), styled Lord Hyde from 1877 to 1914, was a British Conservative politician from the Villiers family. He served as Governor-General of the Union of South Africa from 1931 to 1937.

==Background==
Clarendon was the only son of Edward Hyde Villiers, 5th Earl of Clarendon and his wife Lady Caroline Elizabeth Agar, daughter of James Agar, 3rd Earl of Normanton. George William Frederick Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, three times Foreign Secretary, was his grandfather.

==Political career==
Lord Hyde was in November 1902 appointed an extra aide-de-camp to the Earl of Dudley, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

Clarendon took his seat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords on his father&#x27;s death in 1914. When Bonar Law became Prime Minister in 1922 he appointed Clarendon Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (government chief whip in the House of Lords), a position he also held under Stanley Baldwin until January 1924, and again from December 1924 to 1925. He then served as the first Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs until 1927. In 1931 Clarendon was appointed Governor-General of South Africa, in which position he remained until 1937. During his tenure as Governor-General of South Africa, he also served as Chief Scout of South Africa. Clarendon High School for Girls and its associated schools, Clarendon Primary School and Clarendon Preparatory School in East London, South Africa are named after him.

Clarendon became Lord Chamberlain in 1938 and served until the death of King George VI in 1952. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1931 and made a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1937.

==Family==
Lord Clarendon married Adeline Verena Ishbel Cocks, daughter of Herbert Haldane Somers Cocks, in 1905.

They had three children:
* George Villiers, Lord Hyde, killed in a shooting accident in South Africa in 1935, leaving a son George Frederick Laurence and a posthumous daughter, Rosemary.
* (Nina) Joan Villiers, Lady Newman
* (William) Nicholas Villiers.

He died in December 1955, aged 78. His eldest son George Villiers, Lord Hyde, had been killed in a shooting accident in 1935; the earldom was inherited by George&#x27;s son Laurence.

==Honours==
* He was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Watford on 28 July 1924.
* He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 2 December 1930, which would normally allow him the Title &quot;Sir&quot; but this was outranked by his peerage so was not used. It gave him the Post Nominal Letters &quot;GCMG&quot; for life. 
* He was sworn in as a member of His Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council in 1931. This allowed him the Honorific Title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and the Post Nominal Letters &quot;PC&quot; for life. 
* He was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1937 by HM King George VI, which would normally allow him the Title &quot;Sir&quot; but this was outranked by his peerage so was not used. It gave him the Post Nominal Letters &quot;KG&quot; for life. 
* He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Royal Victorian Order on 8 June 1939 by HM King George VI, which would normally allow him the Title &quot;Sir&quot; but this was outranked by his peerage so was not used. It gave him the Post Nominal Letters &quot;GCVO&quot; for life. He also served as Chancellor of the Order from 1938-1952. 
* He was made a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St John on 18 June 1940. Within the Order this allowed him the post nominal letters &quot;GCStJ&quot; for life. He also served as Prior of the Order from 1943–1946. 
* He was awarded the Royal Victorian Chain on 21 October 1952. by HM Queen Elizabeth II.

<doc id="858369" wikidata="Q971066" url="?curid=858369" title="Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet">
<text>Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet, PC, QC (11 September 1873 – 16 March 1960) was a South African politician, lawyer, and judge who was Chief Justice of South Africa and acting Governor-General from 1943 to 1945.

==Early life==

De Wet was born and went to school in Aliwal North, and attended Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He then went to Downing College at the University of Cambridge, from which he earned his LLB (First Class, with the Chancellor&#x27;s Medal) in 1895. He was admitted as an advocate (the South African equivalent of a barrister) in 1896. During the Anglo-Boer War he was military secretary to General Louis Botha, commandant-general of the Transvaal forces, and acted as an interpreter at the peace conference that ended the war in 1902.

== Political career ==

After the war, de Wet joined Botha in politics, and was a member of the Transvaal legislative assembly from 1907 to 1910. He was a legal adviser to the Transvaal delegation to the 1908-1909 National Convention that drew up the Constitution for the Union of South Africa. In 1913, he was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel. He was also a founder member of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns (&quot;South African Academy for Science and Art&quot;) in 1909.

De Wet was a member of the Union Parliament between 1913 and 1929, serving as a member of the House of Assembly from 1913 to 1920 and a Senator from 1920 to 1929. He served in the South African Party government as Minister of Justice from 1913 to 1924. As such, he had to deal with the legal aspects of an armed Afrikaner uprising against the government in 1914, and the 1922 Rand Revolt.

== Judicial career ==

De Wet was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court in 1932, a judge of the Appeal Court in 1937, and Chief Justice in 1939. As Chief Justice, he was required &quot;ex officio&quot; to act as Officer Administering the Government under a dormant commission, in the absence of the Governor-General, which he did for two and a half years, from the death of Sir Patrick Duncan in 1943 and the appointment of Gideon Brand van Zyl in 1945.

He was appointed a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1939.

== Family life ==

De Wet was married twice. His first wife was Ella Scheepers, who is reputed to have composed the popular Afrikaans song &quot;Sarie Marais&quot; during the Anglo-Boer War. His second wife was Jakomina du Toit. He died in 1960. His son by his first marriage, Dr. Quartus de Wet, was also a judge, and presided over the 1963 Rivonia Treason Trial of Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists.

<doc id="858370" wikidata="Q5098941" url="?curid=858370" title="Chili dog">
<text>A chili dog is a hot dog served in a bun and topped with a meat sauce, typically chili con carne. Additional toppings may include cheese, onions, and mustard. The style has multiple regional variations in the United States, many calling for specific and unique sauce ingredients, types of hot dogs, or types of buns and referred to regionally under region-specific names.

==Regional variations==

===Texas wiener===
In New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the &quot;Texas hot dog&quot;, &quot;Texas chili dog&quot;, &quot;Texas hot&quot;, or &quot;Texas wiener&quot; is a hot dog with chili or hot sauce; it is served in variations with assorted condiments. The Texas wiener was created in Paterson, New Jersey, before 1920 and in Altoona, Pennsylvania, by Peter &quot;George&quot; Koufougeorgas in 1918 and originally called Texas Hot Wieners. The &quot;Texas&quot; reference is to the chili sauce used on the dogs. It is considered a unique regional hot dog style, partly because in addition to the chili or hot sauce, the hot dog itself is always deep-fried. From its origins, the invention spread to the Pennsylvania cities of Scranton and Philadelphia. By the 1920s, it had reached Western New York, where numerous longstanding hot dog stands still remain, including a stand run by the Rigas Family (dating to 1921) and Ted&#x27;s Hot Dogs (which opened in 1927).

===Coney Island hot dog===

In southeastern Michigan, a Coney Island hot dog is a European-style &quot;Frankfurter Würstel&quot; (Vienna sausage) of German origin with a natural lamb or sheep casing, topped with a beef heart-based sauce, which was developed by Macedonian and Greek immigrants in the area. It has several local variations, including Detroit style, Flint style, and Jackson style.

===Hot wiener===

In Rhode Island the hot wiener or New York System wiener is a staple of the food culture and is served at &quot;New York System&quot; restaurants. The traditional wiener is made with a small, thin hot dog made of veal and pork, giving it a different taste from a traditional beef hot dog, served in a steamed bun, and topped with celery salt, yellow mustard, chopped onions, and a seasoned meat sauce.

===Michigan hot dog===
In the North Country of New York State, a Michigan hot dog, or &quot;Michigan&quot;, is a steamed hot dog on a steamed bun topped with a meaty sauce, generally referred to as &quot;Michigan sauce.&quot;

===Cheese coney===
In Greater Cincinnati, as well as parts of northern Oklahoma, such as in Tulsa and Stillwater, OK, Cheese coneys or Coney Islands (without the cheese) are hot dogs in buns topped with Cincinnati chili (a Greek-inspired meat sauce), onions, mustard, and cheese.

===Carolina style===

In North Carolina, hot dogs topped with chili, onions, and either mustard or slaw are referred to as &quot;Carolina style&quot;, which is also used to refer to hamburgers with similar toppings.

===Half-smoke===

In Washington, D.C., the half-smoke is similar to a hot dog, but usually larger, spicier, and with more coarsely-ground meat, the sausage is often half-pork and half-beef, smoked, and served with herbs, onion, and chili sauce.

<text>Communist Revolutionary League of India (CRLI) is a political party in the Indian state of West Bengal. The party is led by Ashim Chatterjee, former student leader of Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). Chattejee broke with Charu Majumdar in 1971 after the failure of the attempts to build an armed movement in the Debra-Gopiballavbur area in West Bengal and due to the opposition of CPI (ML) towards the liberation struggle of Bangladesh. Chatterjee formed the Bengal-Bihar-Orissa Border Regional Committee, CPI (ML). His group joined the CPI (ML) of Satayanarayan Singh. Later Chatterjee formed the CRLI.

During the period of 1995-2000 CRLI was member of Left Front. After breaking with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)), CRLI was in contact with the Party of Democratic Socialism of Saifuddin Chaudhury.

In the 2005 West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections, CRLI leader Chatterjee contested on the election symbol of Trinamool Congress.

In 2015 party returned to Left Front.

<doc id="858373" wikidata="Q3838348" url="?curid=858373" title="Lucas Cornelius Steyn">
<text>Lucas Cornelius Steyn, PC, QC (21 December 1903 – 28 July 1976) was Chief Justice of South Africa and, as such, acted as Governor-General on two occasions.

==Early life==

Steyn was born in 1903 on a farm in the Orange River Colony, shortly after it had fallen under British rule during the Boer War. His parents were Christiaan Louwrens Steyn and Magdalena Josina Maria Kruger. He attended Kroonstad Secondary School and graduated with a law degree from the University of Stellenbosch in 1926, was admitted as an advocate (the South African equivalent of a barrister) in 1928, and obtained a doctorate in law in 1929.

==Legal career==

There followed an illustrious career as a civil servant under four successive Prime Ministers. He was Attorney-General of South West Africa, which was then under South African administration, from 1931 to 1933, and worked in the Department of Justice from 1933 to 1944. He was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1943. He assisted the South African delegation to the United Nations from 1946 to 1949, and was a legal adviser in the 1950 International Court of Justice hearing into South Africa&#x27;s refusal to give up South West Africa.

Steyn was appointed a judge of the High Court (Transvaal Provincial Division) in 1951. Shortly thereafter, in 1955, he was promoted to the Appellate Division. And soon after that he was appointed Chief Justice, ahead of the noted liberal judge of many years&#x27; appellate experience, Oliver Schreiner. This unprecedentedly rapid ascent reflected Steyn&#x27;s favour with D. F. Malan&#x27;s Afrikaner nationalist administration. As Chief Justice, Steyn acted &quot;ex officio&quot; as Officer Administering the Government, i.e. acting Governor-General under a dormant commission, for the period between the death of Dr Jansen in 1959 and the installation of C.R. Swart in 1960, and again between Swart&#x27;s resignation as the last Governor-General in 1961 and his inauguration as the first State President of South Africa a few weeks later. It was he who administered the oaths of office to Swart on both occasions.

Steyn&#x27;s tenure as Chief Justice lasted twelve years. True to his appointment by an Afrikaner nationalist government, Steyn&#x27;s jurisprudence was executive-minded and critical of English influences on South African law. He retired from the bench in 1971.

==Personal life==

Steyn married Huibrecht van Schoor in 1928. They had two children. He died in 1976.

<doc id="858382" wikidata="Q2883930" url="?curid=858382" title="Barbara Cook">
<text>Barbara Cook (October 25, 1927 – August 8, 2017) was an American actress and singer who first came to prominence in the 1950s as the lead in the original Broadway musicals &quot;Plain and Fancy&quot; (1955), &quot;Candide&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1957) among others, winning a Tony Award for the last. She continued performing mostly in theatre until the mid-1970s, when she began a second career as a cabaret and concert singer. She also made numerous recordings.

During her years as Broadway’s leading ingénue, Cook was lauded for her excellent lyric soprano voice. She was particularly admired for her vocal agility, wide range, warm sound, and emotive interpretations. As she aged her voice took on a darker quality, even in her head voice, that was less prominent in her youth. At the time of her death, Cook was widely recognized as one of the &quot;premier interpreters&quot; of musical theatre songs and standards, in particular the songs of composer Stephen Sondheim. Her subtle and sensitive interpretations of American popular song continued to earn high praise even into her eighties. She was named an honoree at the 2011 Kennedy Center Honors.

==Early life==
Cook was born in Atlanta, the daughter of Nell (née Harwell) and Charles Bunyan Cook. Her father was a traveling hat salesman and her mother was an operator for Southern Bell. Her parents divorced when she was a child and, after her only sister died of whooping cough, Barbara lived alone with her mother. She later described their relationship as &quot;so close, too close. I slept with my mother until I came to New York. Slept in the same bed with her. That&#x27;s just, it&#x27;s wrong. But to me, it was the norm...As far as she was concerned, we were one person.&quot; Though Barbara began singing at an early age, at the Elks Club and to her father over the phone, she spent three years after graduating from high school working as a typist.

==Career==
===Early career===

In 1947 Cook was engaged as a featured performer for Atlanta&#x27;s Southeastern Fair at the Lakewood Fairgrounds. While visiting Manhattan in 1948 with her mother, she decided to stay and try to find work as an actress. In 1949 she performed in a touring vaudeville act entitled &quot;A Toast To Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot; which was organized by pianist Erwin Strauss, the son of the composer Oscar Straus. Beginning in Boston, the act performed mainly at hotels and venues owned by Ernie Byfield in cities like New York and Chicago. She began to sing at other clubs and resorts, eventually procuring an engagement at the Blue Angel club in Manhattan in 1950. 

Cook made her Broadway debut as Sandy in the short-lived 1951 musical &quot;Flahooley&quot;. She landed another role quickly, portraying Ado Annie in the 1951 City Center revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, and stayed with the production when it went on its national tour the following year.

Also in 1952, Cook made her first television appearance on the show &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot; which presented her in an original play entitled &quot;Mr. Bemiss Takes a Trip&quot;. In 1954, Cook appeared in the short-lived soap opera &quot;Golden Windows&quot; and starred as Jane Piper in a television version of Victor Herbert&#x27;s operetta &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;. That summer, she returned to City Center to portray Carrie Pipperidge in a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot;, which Cook described as &quot;the first time the critics really paid attention to me. It was like I was the new young thing. It was very important for me.&quot;

In 1955, she received major critical praise for playing the supporting role of Hilda Miller in &quot;Plain and Fancy&quot;. Walter Kerr wrote of her performance: &quot;Barbara Cook, right off a blue and white Dutch plate, is delicious all the time, but especially when she perches on a trunk, savors her first worthwhile kiss, and melts into the melody of &#x27;This Is All Very New to Me&#x27;.&quot; Cook&#x27;s critical reputation and coloratura soprano range won her the role of Cunegonde in Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 1956 operetta &quot;&quot;Candide&quot;&quot;, in which she sang the vocally demanding, show-stopping comic aria &quot;Glitter and Be Gay&quot;.

Although &quot;Candide&quot; was not a commercial success, Cook&#x27;s portrayal of Cunegonde established her as one of Broadway&#x27;s leading ingenues. In 1957 she appeared in a second City Center revival of &quot;Carousel,&quot; this time in the role of Julie Jordan, and won a Tony Award for creating the role of Marian the Librarian in Meredith Willson&#x27;s 1957 hit &quot;The Music Man&quot;. Cook continued to appear regularly on television in the late 1950s, starring in a 1956 &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; production of &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot;, a 1957 live broadcast of &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, and a 1958 musical adaptation of &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. She also made appearances on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;, and &quot;The Play of the Week&quot;.

Cook starred in an acclaimed 1960 City Center revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot; and in the short-lived 1961 musical &quot;The Gay Life&quot;. In 1963, she created the role of Amalia Balash in the classic Jerry Bock-Sheldon Harnick musical &quot;She Loves Me&quot;. Her performance prompted Norman Nadel of the &quot;World-Telegram &amp; Sun&quot; to write, &quot;Her clear soprano is not only one of the finest vocal instruments in the contemporary musical theatre, but it conveys all the vitality, brightness and strength of her feminine young personality, which is plenty.&quot; A number from &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Ice Cream&quot;, became one of Cook&#x27;s signature songs.

In the mid-1960s, Cook began working less frequently. She appeared in the 1964 flop &quot;Something More!&quot;, which ran for only 15 performances on Broadway, and tried her hand at non-musical roles, replacing Sandy Dennis in the play &quot;Any Wednesday&quot; in 1965 and originating the role of Patsy Newquist in Jules Feiffer&#x27;s 1967 play &quot;Little Murders&quot;. She starred in national tours of &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; in 1964 and &quot;Funny Girl&quot; in 1967. Her last original &quot;book&quot; musical role on Broadway came in 1971 when she played Dolly Talbo in &quot;The Grass Harp&quot;. In 1972, Cook returned to the dramatic stage in the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center&#x27;s production of Maxim Gorky&#x27;s &quot;Enemies&quot;.

===1970s to 2004===
As she began struggling with depression, obesity, and alcoholism in the Seventies (she would quit drinking in 1977), Cook had trouble getting stage work. In the mid-1970s Cook&#x27;s fortunes changed for the better when she met and befriended composer and pianist Wally Harper. Harper convinced her to put together a concert and on January 26, 1975, accompanied by Harper, she made her debut in a solo concert at Carnegie Hall that resulted in a legendary concert and live album. Continuing a collaboration with Harper that lasted until his death in 2004, over the next three decades, Barbara Cook became a successful concert performer and Cook and Harper performed together at not only many of the best cabaret spots and music halls in New York City--like Michael&#x27;s Pub and the St. Regis Hotel--but nationally and internationally. Cook and Harper returned to Carnegie Hall in September 1980, to perform a series of songs arranged by Harper. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ reviewer, John S. Wilson, wrote: &quot;Since her first Carnegie Hall appearance, she has grown from a delightful singer to become a delightful entertainer who also happens to be a remarkable singer.&quot; The latter performance was captured on the CD &quot;It&#x27;s Better With a Band&quot;.

In 1986, Cook was nominated for an Olivier Award &quot;The Observer Award for Outstanding Achievement&quot; for her one-woman show, accompanied by Harper, at London&#x27;s Donmar Warehouse and the Albery Theatre. She won the Drama Desk Award &quot;Outstanding One Person Show&quot; in 1987 for her Broadway show &quot;A Concert for the Theatre&quot;, again with Harper. In October 1991, they appeared as featured artists at the Carnegie Hall Gala &quot;Music and Remembrance: A Celebration of Great Musical Partnerships&quot; which raised money for the advancement of the performing arts and for AIDS research. In 1994, they performed a critically acclaimed concert series at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in London, which was recorded by DRG as &quot;Live From London&quot;. &quot;Cook still comes across with consummate taste and with a voice that shows little sign of wear after 40 years.&quot; Alastair Macaulay wrote in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; about the concert, &quot;Barbara Cook is the greatest singer in the world ... Ms. Cook is the only popular singer active today who should be taken seriously by lovers of classical music. Has any singer since Callas matched Cook&#x27;s sense of musical architecture? I doubt it.&quot; The performing duo traveled all over the world giving concerts together including a number of times at the White House – for Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton.

From the mid-1970s on, Cook returned only sporadically to acting, mostly in occasional studio cast and live concert versions of stage musicals. In September 1985 she appeared with the New York Philharmonic as Sally in the renowned concert version of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;. In 1986, she recorded the role of Martha in the Sharon Burgett musical version of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; along with John Cullum, Judy Kaye, and George Rose. In 1987 she performed the role of Julie Jordan in a concert version of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot; with Samuel Ramey as Billy, Sarah Brightman as Carrie, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and she won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show for &quot;A Concert for the Theatre&quot;. In 1988, she originated the role of Margaret White in the ill-fated musical version of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Carrie&quot;, which premiered in England and was presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company. In May of 1990, she was the featured soloist in a program of theatre music given by the Oratorio Society of New York. In 1994, she provided both her acting and singing skills to the animated film version of &quot;Thumbelina&quot;, as Thumbelina&#x27;s mother which featured music by Barry Manilow. That same year she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

In November 1997, Cook celebrated her 70th birthday by giving a concert at Albert Hall in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, joined by performers including Elaine Stritch and Maria Friedman. &quot;The Times&quot; reviewer noted: &quot;The world is usually divided into actresses who try to sing and singers who try to act. Cook is one of the few performers who manage to combine the best of both traditions, as she reminded us in &#x27;It Might as Well be Spring&#x27; – and, at the close, in her encore of Bock and Harnick&#x27;s &#x27;Ice Cream&#x27;.&quot;

In 2000, she was one of the only American performers chosen to perform at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Arts Festival in the Sydney Opera House. Also in 2000, she was joined by Lillias White, Malcolm Gets, and Debbie Gravitte on the studio cast recording of Jimmy McHugh&#x27;s &quot;Lucky in the Rain&quot;.

In February 2001, Cook returned to Carnegie Hall to perform &quot;Barbara Cook Sings Mostly Sondheim&quot; which was recorded live and released on CD. Critically acclaimed from the start, Cook then took the concert to the West End Lyric Theatre in 2001. She garnered two Olivier Award nominations for Best Entertainment and Best Actress in a Musical for the concert. She went on to perform &quot;Sings Mostly Sondheim&quot; at Lincoln Center for a sold-out fourteen-week run from December 2001 to January 2002, and again in June 2002 to August 2002. She was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Theatrical Event. She took the show on a National tour throughout major cities in the United States. DRG filmed the stage production during a performance at the Pepsico Theatre, SUNY Purchase, New York, on October 11, 2002 and it was released on DVD on the DRG/Koch Entertainment label. In June and August 2002 Cook performed &quot;Sings Mostly Sondheim&quot; at the Terrace Theater, Kennedy Center as part of the Sondheim Celebration.

In 2004 she performed two limited engagement concert series at the Vivian Beaumont and Mitzi Newhouse theaters at Lincoln Center, &quot;Barbara Cook&#x27;s Broadway!&quot;, with Harper as her musical director/arranger. She received the New York Drama Critics Circle Award (&quot;for her contribution to the musical theater&quot;) and a nomination for the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Solo Performance. A recording of the concert was made.

===Later years===
After Wally Harper&#x27;s death in October 2004, Cook made adjustments to new accompanists in solo shows like &quot;Tribute&quot; (a reference to Harper) and &quot;No One Is Alone&quot; that continued to receive acclaim; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2005 that she was &quot;at the top of her game... Cook&#x27;s voice is remarkably unchanged from 1958, when she won the Tony Award for playing Marian the Librarian in &quot;The Music Man.&quot; A few high notes aside, it is, eerily, as rich and clear as ever.&quot; In January 2006, Cook became the first female pop singer to be presented by the Metropolitan Opera in the company&#x27;s more than one hundred-year history. She presented a solo concert of Broadway show tunes and classic jazz standards, and was supported on a few numbers by guest singers Audra McDonald and Josh Groban and Elaine Stritch (although Stritch did not appear on the CD of the concert). The concert was recorded and subsequently released on CD. On June 25, 2006, Cook was the special guest star of the Award Winning Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus of Washington, D.C., celebrating GMCW&#x27;s Silver Anniversary in a performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC.

Cook was the featured artist at the &quot;Arts! by George&quot; gala on September 29, 2007 at the Fairfax campus of George Mason University. On October 22, 2007, Cook sang at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts with the Fort Lauderdale Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus in the chorus&#x27;s concert entitled &quot;An Evening With Barbara Cook&quot;. Upon completion of the concert, an almost full house greeted her with a round of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in honor of her impending 80th birthday, which, on December 2, 2007, she celebrated belatedly in the UK with a concert at the Coliseum Theatre in London&#x27;s West End.

As she entered her ninth decade, Cook performed in two sold-out concerts with the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center in 2007. The &quot;New York Times&quot; Stephen Holden wrote that Cook is &quot;a performer spreading the gospel of simplicity, self-reliance and truth&quot; who is &quot;never glib&quot; and summoning adjectives such as &quot;astonishing&quot; and &quot;transcendent&quot;, concluding that she sings with &quot;a tenderness and honesty that could break your heart and mend it all at once.&quot;

In June 2008, Cook appeared in &quot;Strictly Gershwin&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England, with the full company of English National Ballet. An advertised appearance with the Ulster Orchestra as the Closing Concert of the Ulster Bank Belfast Festival at Queen&#x27;s at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on October 31, 2008 was cancelled due to scheduling difficulties. Her other 2008 appearances included concerts in Chicago and San Francisco.

In 2009, she performed with the Princeton Symphony, Detroit Symphony, and gave concerts in Boca Raton, Florida, and at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton. She performed in a cabaret show at Feinsteins at the Regency (New York City) which opened in April 2009.

Cook returned to Broadway in 2010 in the Roundabout Theatre&#x27;s Stephen Sondheim revue &quot;Sondheim on Sondheim&quot;, created and directed by long-time Sondheim collaborator James Lapine, at Studio 54. She starred opposite Vanessa L. Williams, Norm Lewis and Tom Wopat. Cook was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance in the category of Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical. On April 12, 2011, Cook appeared with James Taylor, Bette Midler and Sting, at Carnegie Hall for a gala called &quot;Celebrating 120 Years of Carnegie Hall&quot;.

Cook was named an honoree at the 2011 Kennedy Center Honors, held on December 4, 2011 (the ceremony was broadcast on CBS on December 27, 2011). Performers paying tribute to Cook on that occasion included Matthew Broderick, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patti LuPone, Glenn Close, Kelli O&#x27;Hara, Rebecca Luker, Sutton Foster, Laura Osnes, Anna Christy, and Audra McDonald.

In 2016, Cook published her autobiography &quot;Then &amp; Now: A Memoir&quot; with collaborator Tom Santopietro. She announced her retirement in May 2017.

==Personal life==
Cook married acting teacher David LeGrant (December 8, 1923 – July 28, 2011) on March 9, 1952, after meeting at a resort on the Borscht Belt. They performed together in a national stage tour of &quot;Oklahoma&quot; in 1953. The couple had one child, Adam, born in 1959. They divorced in 1965. 

===Death===
Cook died from respiratory failure at her home in Manhattan on August 8, 2017, at age 89. The marquee lights of the Broadway theaters were dimmed for one minute in tribute to Cook on August 9. Cook&#x27;s friend and fellow musical theater actress, Elaine Paige paid tribute to Cook during her BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Elaine Paige on Sunday&quot; on August 13.

<text>HMS &quot;A3&quot; was an submarine built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She sank in 1912. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Historic England.

==Design and description==
&quot;A3&quot; was a member of the first British class of submarines, although slightly larger, faster and more heavily armed than the lead ship, . The submarine had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The A-class submarines had a crew of 2 officers and 9 ratings.

For surface running, the boats were powered by a single 16-cylinder Wolseley petrol engine that drove one propeller shaft. When submerged the propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, &quot;A3&quot; had a range of at ; the boat had a range of at submerged.

The boats were armed with two 18-inch (45 cm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as doing so that they had to compensate for their weight by an equivalent weight of fuel.

==Construction and career==

&quot;A3&quot; was laid down by Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim as Yard No.295 at Barrow-in-Furness on 6 November 1902 and was launched on 9 May 1903. She was commissioned on 13 July 1904. She primarily served as a coastal defense and training submarine in her over seven years of service.

On 2 February 1912, &quot;A3&quot;, along with several other submarines dispatched from the port of Gosport, conducted training exercises on target ships in the Solent. Whilst attacking the depot ship , the semi-submerged &quot;A3&quot; accidentally collided with its target southwest of the East Princessa Buoy in the eastern Solent. Its rudder and propeller were both disabled, and the holed submarine sank immediately with all 14 hands lost. The King sent his immediate condolences to the families of the lost seamen.

The submarine was raised from the bottom on 11 March and was brought into the south lock of Portsmouth dockyard the following day, slung below a salvage lighter; the lock was pumped dry so that the 14 bodies could be recovered and the damages surveyed.

After being towed from Portsmouth to Portland Naval Dockyard, the wreck was towed offshore into Weymouth Bay and, after some technical experiments on the hull, it was sunk as a gunnery target by shells from on 17 May 1912. In July 2016 the wreck of &quot;A3&quot; was officially designated as a protected site.

<doc id="858390" wikidata="Q751629" url="?curid=858390" title="East Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>East Londonderry is a constituency in Northern Ireland represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. Its current Member of Parliament (MP) has been Gregory Campbell of the DUP since 2001.

==Constituency profile==
This is a mostly rural constituency stretching from the hill country of the Sperrin Mountains in the south to the Atlantic coast in the north; and from the suburbs of Derry city in the west to the River Bann in the east. The constituency&#x27;s two main towns are Limavady and Coleraine; other urban areas include the upland town of Dungiven; and the coastal resorts of Portstewart and Portrush (the latter in fact lies in Country Antrim).

==Boundaries==
The seat was created in boundary changes in 1983, as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17, and was predominantly made up from the old Londonderry constituency, minus the area around the city of Derry itself which formed the new Foyle constituency.

From further revisions in 1995 (when it lost parts of the district of Magherafelt to the Mid Ulster constituency), and until the 2008 revision, it covered exactly the same area as the districts of Coleraine and Limavady. The inclusion of all of Coleraine Borough means that part of the East Londonderry constituency is actually in County Antrim.

For the 2010 general election the East Londonderry constituency was formed by the following local government areas, as confirmed by the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order.
*The entire local government districts of Limavady and Coleraine.
*Banagher, and Claudy, from the Londonderry district.

Prior to the 2024 general election, the following additions were made to the East Londonderry constituency:

* The entire ward of Eglinton is transferred from Foyle.
* The entire ward of Claudy, which was split between Foyle and East Londonderry, is assigned to East Londonderry.

==History==
The constituency has a Unionist majority although, in many elections, nationalists have polled close to 35% of the vote, and the middle-of-the-road Alliance Party sometimes above 10%. The main interest in elections has been the contest between the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party. The UUP were normally ahead of the DUP until the 2001 general election, when the DUP finally overtook them.

The 2001 election was seen at a province-wide level as a battle over the Belfast Agreement, with the DUP opposed to it and most of the UUP in favour. However, that situation was seemingly reversed in East Londonderry, in which the sitting Ulster Unionist MP, William Ross, was completely opposed to all involvement with the Agreement and its institutions, whilst the DUP candidate, Gregory Campbell, was a minister in the executive set up by the agreement. Many commentators joked that the DUP&#x27;s gain meant that East Londonderry now had a &quot;more&quot; pro-agreement MP than before.

For the history of the equivalent constituency prior to 1983, see Londonderry.

In the 2016 EU referendum 21,098 people in the constituency voted to remain in the European Union, 19,455 voted to leave, and 10 votes were rejected.

The seat had a considerable swing to Sinn Féin in the 2024 General Election of over 12%, but the DUP still just retained the constituency, albeit with a very narrow majority of 179 votes, now making it a highly marginal contest between them and Sinn Féin.

== Members of Parliament ==

The Member of Parliament since the 2001 general election is Gregory Campbell of the Democratic Unionist Party. In that election he defeated William Ross of the Ulster Unionist Party who had represented East Londonderry since 1983 and its predecessor seat of Londonderry between 1974 and 1983.

<doc id="858391" wikidata="Q6206877" url="?curid=858391" title="Jobsworth">
<text>A jobsworth is a person who uses the (typically small) authority of their job in a deliberately uncooperative way, or who seemingly delights in acting in an obstructive or unhelpful manner. It characterises one who upholds petty rules even at the expense of effectiveness or efficiency. Related concepts include malicious compliance, passive-aggressive behavior, and micromanagement, which can impair progress through excessive focus on details and obsessive control over those one has authority over.

==Origin==
&quot;Jobsworth&quot; is a British colloquialism derived from the notion that something being asked of one in a work environment is too great to risk their job over, as in, &quot;I can&#x27;t do that; it&#x27;s more than my job&#x27;s worth.&quot; 

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines it as &quot;A person in authority (esp. a minor official) who insists on adhering to rules and regulations or bureaucratic procedures even at the expense of common sense.&quot; Jonathon Green similarly defines &quot;jobsworth&quot; as &quot;a minor whose only status comes from enforcing otherwise petty regulations&quot;. It is a form of passive aggressive obstructionism, using the letter of the law as a weapon to impair progress or prevent change.

==Examples==
An example of the phrase in its original context can be found in the 1965 Beatles movie &quot;Help!&quot;, when Roy Kinnear&#x27;s character, the assistant scientist Algernon, exclaims, &quot;Well it&#x27;s more than my job&#x27;s worth to stop him when he&#x27;s like this; he&#x27;s out to rule the world...if he can get a government grant.&quot;

An example of the term in its fully formed metaphorical use was by UK folk-singer Jeremy Taylor in a song he wrote in the late 1960s:
==Usage==
The term became widespread in vernacular English through its use in the popular 1970s BBC television programme &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;, which featured Esther Rantzen covering various human interest and consumer topics. A &quot;Jobsworth of the Week&quot; commissionaire&#x27;s hat was awarded each week to &quot;a startling tale of going by the book&quot;.

The term is in use, particularly in the UK, to characterise inflexible employees, petty rule-following and excessive administration, and is generally used in a pejorative context.

The slang expression &quot;Little Hitler&quot; is also used with a similar meaning.

<text>The Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission is a non-departmental public body of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office that awards scholarships and fellowships to American students for postgraduate and postdoctoral study and research at UK universities.

==History==

The commission was established by the Marshall Aid Commemoration Act 1953 (1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2. c. 39) of the UK Parliament, in recognition of the Marshall Plan, which had provided economic support to Western Europe (including the UK) in the aftermath of the Second World War. The principal architect of the scheme was Sir Roger Makins (1904-1996), a Deputy Under Secretary in the Foreign Office. Soon after the bill was passed by parliament Makins was appointed British Ambassador to the United States. He was subsequently ennobled as Baron Sherfield.

The commission has up to ten members, who are appointed by the British Government. The first chairman was Sir Oliver Franks (1905-1992), who had been British Ambassador to the US while the Marshall Plan was in operation. The work of the commission is administered by the Association of Commonwealth Universities.

Twelve Marshall scholarships were awarded in the first year. The number of awards increased over the years with forty new awards made in 2017. Since 1954, approximately 1,800 Marshall Scholarships have been awarded.

Marshall Sherfield Fellowships were established in 1997 for postdoctoral research. The fellowships are named after Lord Sherfield, who as Sir Roger Makins was the architect of the commission.

Total expenditure in the year to March 2016 was £2,157,267, of which 93% was funded by the UK government. Some scholarships were jointly funded from other sources.

==Marshall Scholarships==

Marshall Scholarships are for postgraduate study by US students at UK universities. Candidates are nominated by US universities and are interviewed by eight regional committees in the US, based at the British Consulates-General and at the British Embassy in Washington DC.

The scholarships can cover courses of study from one or two years, extendable to three years. They pay university fees, a living allowance and travel from and to the US. Additional allowances are available for books and for research travel.

==Marshall Sherfield Fellowships==
Marshall Sherfield Fellowships support up to two American postdoctoral researchers to study at a UK university or research institute.

==Marshall Medals==
Marshall Medals are awarded every ten years by the commission, &quot;to people of outstanding achievement whose contribution to British-American understanding, distinguished role in public life, or creative energy, reflect the legacy of George C Marshall.&quot;

==Commissioners==

* John Raine (Chair)
* Anulika Ajufo
* Dr Andrew Bell
* Professor Richard Black

<text>Tīrau is a small town in the Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand, 50 kilometres southeast of Hamilton. The town has a population of 804 (2018 census). In the Māori language, &quot;Tīrau&quot; means &quot;place of many cabbage trees.&quot;

Tīrau is a major junction in the New Zealand state highway network. Just south of the township is the intersection of State Highway 1 and State Highway 5, where traffic from Auckland and Hamilton on State Highway 1 split to go either to Rotorua on SH 5, or continue along SH 1 to Taupō and beyond to Napier, Palmerston North and Wellington. State Highway 27 splits off State Highway 1 in the north of the town, providing a route north to the Coromandel Peninsula and an alternative route to Auckland, bypassing Hamilton.

Tīrau is primarily a farming town but in recent years has begun to exploit the income that comes from being at a major road junction.

The small community of Okoroire (with hot springs) is located just north of Tīrau. Okoroire railway station was over to the west of the springs.

==History and culture==
===European settlement===
In the 19th century, Tīrau, then known as Oxford, was originally planned as a township. However plans were changed after the entrepreneurial Rose family bought up large areas of land in the region, with the intention of making large returns when it came of high demand. Oxford later became a rural service town.

Oxford Royal Hotel opened on 15 April 1881. A store followed in June, but by September 1881 Oxford still only had the hotel and store. 94 lots in the township, which it had been planned to sell in 1891, were offered for sale in 1882. In the 1886 census, Oxford had a population of 48 in the 1896 census, 27 in 1891 and 127 in 1911.

In 1886, James Anthony Froude visited Oxford and described it as having a single inn, with the town surrounded by desert with little vegetation growth.

=== Name ===
Oxford was a name given to the proposed township when it was sold by McLean &amp; Co in 1881. It may have been to identify it as a sister town to Cambridge. Oxford changed its name to Tirau on 23 May 1896. To avoid confusion with Oxford in Canterbury, the Piako County Council asked the name to be changed. The name &quot;Tirau&quot;, suggested by two councillors, was chosen. Tirau is the name of the hill near the township. The name was spelt without a macron until 2019, when the New Zealand Geographic Board made Tīrau the official name.
===Railway station===
Oxford railway station was at the site where the Kinleith Branch crossed Okoroire Rd The Thames Valley &amp; Rotorua Railway Co. opened it on Monday 8 March 1886. The first train left Oxford at 7.50am and arrived in Auckland at 4.35pm, away. Morrinsville is away. Oxford was the terminus for a few months until 21 June 1886, when the line was extended south to Putāruru and Lichfield. On 3 days a week, from the start of the train service, a coach ran to Ohinemutu, at Rotorua.

New Zealand Railways Department took over the line on 1 April 1886. By August there was a coal shed (23ft x 15ft, 50 tons capacity), 2 cottages, by goods shed, turntable and a stationmaster&#x27;s house. In 1895 the stationmaster was moved to Putāruru and Tirau was downgraded to a flag station. However, by 1896 Tīrau also had a 4th class station, platform, cart approach, loading bank, cattle yards, 4-stall engine shed, urinals and a passing loop for 26 wagons (extended for 70 wagons in 1964). In 1898 it was recommended that the engine shed be moved to Grahamstown, though a double shed was then built there. By 1911 there were also sheep yards.

563 passengers bought tickets in 1894, 330 in 1895 and 308 in 1896, when the main import was coal and the main exports timber and sheep. It was renamed Tirau on 8 March 1886.

In 1963 a new station in dark Huntly brick, with a storeroom, office, waiting room and platform for two railcars was built for about £4,800. Closure to passengers was on 12 November 1968 and to goods, except private siding traffic, on 29 March 1981. In 1989 the station was derelict, but still had a low level platform.

The main remnant of the station, alongside Prospect Avenue, is an NZHPT Category II listed (on 5 September 1985, List Number 4230) brick water tower. Opening of the station was delayed a week as the water supply wasn&#x27;t complete. Like other Thames Valley &amp; Rotorua stations, water was fed to a brick tank, supplied from the Oraka Stream, about to the south, by a Blake hydraulic ram. Similar towers remain at Lichfield and Ngātira. Fonterra still moves freight by rail from its Tīrau factory, which runs a very large anaerobic digester.

===Recent history===
In 1991, local business man Henry Clothier took advantage of the town&#x27;s relatively cheap real estate and high traffic volume by opening an Antique shop in the former Rose Bros. grocery store building. Many other businesses followed suit off the back of his success throughout the 1990s until today. Tīrau has built a reputation as a shopping destination for antiques, collectibles and other niche items.

In 2005/06 the South Waikato District Council is working, on behalf of the Tīrau Ward, in conjunction with the community, to develop a concept plan for Tīrau&#x27;s future.

===Marae===

The local Paparāmu Marae and Te Apunga meeting house are affiliated with the Ngāti Raukawa hapū of Ngāti Mōtai and Ngāti Te Apunga.

The town is now a well known tourist stop-off, and is characterised by many art works created out of corrugated iron. The church and many of the shops feature corrugated iron sculptures by local artist Steven Clothier and two large buildings are completely made from this material; the information centre which is shaped like a giant dog, and the neighbouring sheep and ram building - earning Tīrau the title of &quot;Corrugated Capital of the World&quot;.

The Castle, a large toy museum on the town&#x27;s southern limits which opened in 2000, can clearly be seen when heading towards the township from Rotorua or Taupō. The Tīrau dairy factory is New Zealand&#x27;s only producer of lactalbumin, a key ingredient in the production of sports supplements.

==Government==
Tīrau is governed locally by the South Waikato District Council. Nationally, Tīrau is part of the general electorate and the Māori electorate.

<doc id="858406" wikidata="Q358576" url="?curid=858406" title="Technoparade">
<text>A technoparade (taken from the German word &quot;Technoparade&quot;) is a parade of vehicles equipped with strong loudspeakers and amplifiers playing electronic dance music. It resembles a carnival parade in some respects, but the vehicles (called lovemobiles) are usually less elaborately decorated. Unlike some carnival parades, a technoparade does not share the tradition of bombarding the spectators with sweets. However, the revellers do occasionally throw confetti (usually larger and more sparkly than that in a carnival parade) and spray foam from the vehicles onto the crowd.

Nearly all of the vehicles are converted trucks. In order to power the amplifiers, the trucks are frequently equipped with an additional electrical generator. For safety reasons, horse-drawn floats are never used in technoparades: there would be a danger of horses panicking from the noise and chaos. However, there are occasional human-drawn floats equipped with generators, record players, amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some of the vehicles allow people to ride along, for a fee. For those on the sidelines, or travelling alongside on foot or bicycles, attendance is free.

== Official program ==
The official program of a technoparade is generally not as important as what happens informally. In contrast to a carnival parade, the vehicles are little more than flatbed trucks with sound equipment, rather than elaborately decorated floats. There are usually no fireworks or other traditional elements of large celebrations. Technoparades are rarely linked to anniversaries of historical events: they usually simply take place in the summer to take advantage of the good weather.

However, in Germany technoparades are usually officially registered as a political demonstration and thus have an appropriate motto. That way techno fans have a constitutional right to dance in the streets, and any objections from the authorities to noise and traffic obstructions are overruled and the cities also have to pay for security and cleaning up the streets afterwards.

== Character ==

Technoparades generally have a carnival atmosphere, where social rules (and some laws, or at least their enforcement) are at least loosened, and sometimes broken outright. An atmosphere of chaos and tolerance prevails as bystanders dance to the shifting sounds of successive vehicles rolling by them: the music blasting from one vehicle blends into that from another, which can mean a sudden change of dance style in the area where the spheres of influence overlap. The music coming from two sound trucks overlaps with approximately equal intensity, and people can dance to either of two competing rhythms. In the technoparade subculture they call this the &quot;Verwirrungsgebiet&quot; (&quot;overlap zone&quot;) by analogy to a concept in radio frequency engineering.

The street allows for a type of dancing that would be literally impossible in cramped German nightclubs, and the breadth of some people&#x27;s dancing is further exaggerated as they throw their clothes outwards. Some in the crowd generally climb up to any high point that can possibly be scaled, more and more as the event continues. The spirit is usually continued at after-parties in the local nightclubs, sometimes including unofficial after-parties at venues having no official connection to the parade.

==Similar Events==
Similar to technoparades, electronic dance events have also been organized using other moving vehicles such as boats and trams. In contrast to technoparades which are characterized by free participation on the street, in this case only the passengers on the vessels or inside the trams are part of the event. An example for a boatparade is the &quot;Berlin Beats &amp; Boats&quot; event which takes place annually since 2009 and involves up to 14 swimming dancefloors. A regular &quot;Housetram&quot; event has been organized by Monika Kruse in Munich since 1995.

<text>In radio frequency engineering, an overlap zone occurs where signals from two or more radio stations, transmitting at the same frequency, can be received with comparable intensity. Interference occurs frequently in such a zone.

In order to avoid this, a receiver with directional antenna is used, which can then be aligned in such a way that it will only receive the signal of one transmitter. Alternatively, the signals could be separated using a demodulator in single sideband mode.

With digital radio (Digital Radio Mondiale and Digital Audio Broadcasting being two common types), there is no interference in the overlap zone.

<text>The Street Parade is a techno music festival in Zurich, Switzerland. With around one million attendees, it is the world&#x27;s most attended technoparade. The Street Parade takes place annually on the second Saturday in August. Officially a demonstration for freedom, love and tolerance, the parade proceeds along the northern edge of Lake Zurich.

The first Street Parade (the English name is used in German) took place on 5 September 1992, initiated by student Marek Krynski and was officially called the Demonstration for Love, Peace, Liberty, Generosity and Tolerance (). About 1,000 people took part, dancing behind two motorized floats with sound equipment, DJs and dancers known as &quot;Lovemobiles&quot;.

==Organisation==
Since 1996, the event has been organised by the &quot;Verein Street Parade&quot; (Street Parade Association). While the Street Parade now has all the characteristics of a popular festival, legally it is still a political demonstration.

==Chronology==
Notable events of the Street Parade:

* 1992: The first Street Parade took place with around 1,000 participants.
* 1993: The parade grew in popularity with around 10,000 attendees.
* 1994: The parade faced a ban, which was later overturned due to public protests. The event moved to a new route around Lake Zurich.
* 1995: The parade attracted 150,000 people and released its first official CD.
* 1996: &quot;Verein Street Parade&quot; (Street Parade Association) was founded to organize the event.
* 2000: The parade was broadcast live on television for the first time.
* 2001: The parade had a record attendance of over one million people.
* 2003: The parade route was reversed due to noise concerns.
* 2005: The event faced financial difficulties but was saved by sponsors. Beer was sold for the first time, leading to some concerns about an increase in aggressive behavior.
* 2007: The parade focused on the theme of &quot;Respect&quot; and attracted around 800,000 people.
* 2009: Despite rain and concerns about swine flu, 600,000 people attended the parade.
* 2010: The parade saw a slight increase in attendance compared to the previous year. A moment of silence was held for the victims of the Love Parade disaster in Duisburg.
* 2011: The parade celebrated its 20th anniversary with around 900,000 attendees.
* 2020 and 2021: The parade was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* 2022: The parade returned with nearly one million attendees.
* 2023: The 30th Street Parade saw a similar attendance level as the previous year and a Swiss Federal Councillor participated in the parade for the first time.
* 2024: The 31st Street Parade attracted around 920,000 attendees. The hot weather led to numerous medical incidents.

==Notable DJs==
Notable DJs who have participated in Street Parade include: Carl Cox, David Morales, Sven Väth, Chris Liebing, Loco Dice, Michel von Tell, DJ Energy, Felix Kröcher, DJ Hell, Mind Against, DJ Antoine, Dr. Motte, Steve Lawler, and Tom Novy.

==Political aspects==
According to the event&#x27;s official website, &quot;The Street Parade is still a demonstration that calls on everyone to live together in peace and tolerance.&quot;

==Alternatives==
Since 1996, a counter event called &quot;Antiparade&quot; takes place in Zurich on the same day as the Street Parade to provide an alternative to it. Similar to the Fuckparade in Berlin, the goal of this smaller technoparade is to demonstrate against the increasing commercialisation of club culture.

<text>Peter Cross (born 1951 in Guildford) is a British illustrator. His style features lifelike drawings of British wildlife, in cartoon-like situations. Ostensibly produced for children, they include sufficient visual puns to be of interest to adults. He first worked as a technical illustrator for Hawker Siddeley and also illustrated album sleeves, not least for guitarist Anthony Phillips and over 200 designs in the popular &quot;Harbottle Hamster&quot; range of greetings cards for Gordon Fraser.

*&quot;Dudley Goes Flying&quot;, 
*&quot;Dudley and the Monster&quot;, - &quot;The extraordinary illustrations are richly detailed in the style of many British children&#x27;s books. They focus dramatically on the central action in each picture, allowing the young reader to direct his attention to the unfolding tale.&quot;
*&quot;Dudley and the Strawberry Shake&quot;, - Dudley the dormouse goes to a strawberry patch to pick strawberries, picks one and eats it but then mistakes a dogs nose for one. The dog does not like having his nose pulled and shakes his head until Dudley lets go and flies through the air. The story ends with Dudley going home for a nap to recover, and as he is falling asleep he remembers that he has left his strawberry picking gloves behind.

<text>Murathan Mungan (born 21 April 1955) is a Turkish author, short story writer, playwright, and poet.

== Biography ==
Mungan&#x27;s family originates from Mardin. His father is an Arab and mother is a Bosniak. After receiving his BA from the Faculty of Letters and Drama at Ankara University, he worked as a dramaturg before devoting all his time to writing poetry, plays, short stories, novels, film scenarios, and songs. His first collection of poems, &quot;Osmanlıya Dair Hikayat&quot; (&quot;Stories about Ottomans&quot;) was published in 1980, making Mungan an overnight success.

His output remained prolific and various poetry books followed, notably &quot;Yaz Gecer&quot; (&quot;Summer Passes&quot;) and &quot;Metal&quot;. He has written four theatre plays, which earned him wider success. &quot;Mahmud ile Yezida&quot;, &quot;Taziye&quot; are two of the most staged plays of the modern Turkish theatre. He was chosen as the best playwright, together with Mehmet Baydın, by the Ankara Art Association for his staging of the play Condolences, the second book of the Mesopotamia Trilogy, in 1984.

His short stories were compiled in successful volumes such as &quot;Kırk Oda&quot; (&quot;Forty Rooms&quot;) and &quot;Paranın Cinleri&quot; (&quot;Genies of Money&quot;). His screenplay &quot;Dağınık Yatak&quot; (&quot;Messy Bed&quot;) was later filmed by director Atıf Yılmaz in 1986 starring Turkish actress Müjde Ar.

Mungan also wrote lyrics to some of Yeni Türkü&#x27;s songs, and for pop singers such as Nükhet Duru.

In 2006, Murathan Mungan supervised the production of a music album by Turkish arabesk singer Müslüm Gürses, featuring cover versions of popular songs such as &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; by Leonard Cohen, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; by Bob Dylan, and &quot;I&#x27;m Deranged&quot; by David Bowie, all of which were selected by Mungan.

Openly gay, Mungan has been often associated with the Turkish gay movement as a gay icon.

<text>A victory column, or monumental column or triumphal column, is a monument in the form of a column, erected in memory of a heroic commemoration, including victorious battle, war, or revolution. The column typically stands on a base and is crowned with a victory symbol, such as a statue. The statue may represent the goddess Victoria; in Germany, the female embodiment of the nation, Germania; in the United States either the female embodiment of the nation Liberty or Columbia; in the United Kingdom, the female embodiment Britannia, an eagle, or a naval war hero depicted as a helmeted woman, wielding a trident, shield and olive branch.

== Monumental columns ==
==List of Roman victory columns==
Of the columns listed above, the following are the Roman columns. Roman triumphal columns were either monolithic pillars or composed of column drums; in the later case, these were often hollowed out to accommodate an ancient spiral staircase leading up to the platform on top.

The earliest triumphal column was Trajan&#x27;s Column which, dedicated in 113 AD, defined its architectural form and established its symbolic value as a political monument alongside the older Roman triumphal arches, providing a lingering model for its successors to this day. The imperial capitals of Rome and Constantinople house the most ancient triumphal columns.

All dimensions are given here in metres, though it was the Roman foot by which ancient architects determined the harmonious proportions of the columns, and which is thus crucial for understanding their design. The list is sorted by date of erection.

<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Young Offenders Institution (or HM YOI) are youth detention centres for offenders between ages 15 to 21 in the United Kingdom. These offenders will have received a custodial sentence following criminal offence convictions or may be being held on remand awaiting trial on pending charges. 

A young offender&#x27;s institution can accommodate between 60 and 400 young people, with each age group housed in its own wing of between 30 and 60 inmates. Most young offenders&#x27; institutions are run by the national prison service while some are run by private companies on behalf of the prison service.

==Background==

Young Offender Institutions were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, but secure institutions specifically intended for young offenders have existed since the beginning of the 20th century: the first borstal opened at Borstal, Kent in 1902.

The regime of a Young Offender Institution is similar to that of an adult prison. There are slight differences, notably a lower staff-to-offender ratio. Prisoners serving sentences at Young Offender Institutions are expected to participate in at least 25 hours of education per week, aimed at behaviour improvement, practical skill development for post-release and employment preparation. There are also opportunities for prisoners to undertake work in Community Service Volunteer programmes.

==Issues==
Violence is frequently reported in Young Offender Institutions and staff have been criticised for failing to prevent it.
Solitary confinement is often used, with inmates reportedly often confined to cells for up to 21 hours a day and given little tuition or guidance. At all YOIs during a six-month period there were 306 cases of segregation lasting over a week, which is &quot;very high&quot;, with contributory factors including gang involvement, insufficient prison staff and a lack of NHS mental health beds.

Recidivism rates are high, with up to three quarters of released offenders re-offending within a year. Offenders undergo assessments on the likeliness of reoffending. This assessment is known as Youth level of service.

<text>The Victory Column ( , from &quot;Sieg&quot; &#x27;victory&#x27; + &quot;Säule&quot; &#x27;column&#x27;) is a monument in Berlin, Germany. Designed by Heinrich Strack after 1864 to commemorate the Prussian victory in the Second Schleswig War, by the time it was inaugurated on 2 September 1873, Prussia had also defeated Austria and its German allies in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), giving the statue a new purpose. Different from the original plans, these later victories in the unification wars inspired the addition of the bronze sculpture of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory, high, designed by Friedrich Drake, giving the victory column its current height of 67m.

Berliners have given the statue the nickname &quot;Goldelse&quot;, meaning something like &quot;Golden Lizzy&quot;, named after an 1866 novel by E. Marlitt and its heroine.
The Victory Column is a major tourist attraction in the city of Berlin. Its viewing platform, for which a ticket is required, offers a view over Berlin.

==History, design, and influences==
===Design===
The base consists of polished red Swedish granite, measuring 18.8 meters square and 7.2 meters high. The base contains four bronze reliefs depicting scenes from the three victories. Measuring 12 meters wide and 2 meters high, they were designed by Moritz Schulz, Karl Keil, Alexander Calandrelli, and Albert Wolff. Upon the base is a round hall with 16 granite columns measuring 4.7 meters high. Along the hall&#x27;s circumference is a glass mosaic designed by Anton von Werner. Four sandstone columns rise above this hall, the first three containing 20 gilded gun barrels each, 12 pounders from the Danish victory, 8 pounders from the Austrian victory, and 4 pounders from the French victory. On top of the fourth sandstone column resides the 8.52 meter tall gilded bronze victory.

The relief decoration was removed in 1945. It was restored for the 750th anniversary of Berlin in 1987 by the French president at that time, François Mitterrand.

===Locations===
The Victory Column originally stood in Königsplatz (now Platz der Republik). In 1938/1939, as part of the preparation of the monumental plans to redesign Berlin into Welthauptstadt Germania, the Nazis relocated the column to its present site at the &quot;Großer Stern&quot; (Great Star). At the same time, the column was augmented by another 6.5 metres, giving it its present height of 66.89 metres. The monument survived World War II without much damage. Surrounded by a street circle, the column is also accessible to pedestrians through four tunnels, according to plans by Albert Speer. A spiral staircase leads to a viewing platform under the statue.

==Historical significance==
During the Battle of Berlin of 1945, Soviet troops nicknamed the column &quot;the Tall Woman&quot;. Polish Army troops, fighting alongside their Soviet allies, hoisted the Polish flag on the column on 2 May 1945 at the end of the Battle in Berlin. This is celebrated yearly as Polish National Flag Day.

During the Berlin Victory Parade of 1945, the French tricolour was raised atop the column on the statue by French troops.

It served as the location for Barack Obama&#x27;s speech in Berlin as a US presidential candidate during his visit to Germany on 24 July 2008.

==In popular culture==

In Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987), the column is one of many high places in the city where angels sit and look down.

The golden statue atop the column, cast in 1873 by the Aktien-Gesellschaft Gladenbeck foundry in Berlin, was featured in the music video to U2&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot;, an homage to Wings of Desire.

During the years of the techno Love Parade, the column was a meeting point where large numbers of people danced together.

The Berlin queer monthly magazine &quot;Siegessäule&quot;, founded 1984 as a gay publication, was named after the monument. The Berlin Pride (CSD parade) usually includes the column on its route for the symbolism.

The monument is one of the many landmarks visited in the &quot;Berlin Byways&quot; course in &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; (since 2021), and later &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot; (since 2022).

<text>Josselin (; ) is a commune in the Morbihan department in Brittany in northwestern France.

==History==

St Meriadek is said to have founded a chapel there during the 4th century. Much later Josselin became a stronghold of the House of Rohan.

An alternative explanation for the location of the chapel concerns a labourer who in 808 discovered a wooden statue in the brambles which enabled his hitherto blind daughter to see. A chapel was constructed on the site of this miracle which subsequently grew into a church (parts of which date back to the twelfth century). A fresco in the church now recalls the Combat of the Thirty summarized below.

In 1351, during the Breton War of Succession (part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War), two groups of approximately 30 English knights (led by Robert Bramborough, the English captain of Ploërmel) and Franco-Breton knights (commanded by Jean de Beaumanoir, captain of Josselin) staged an arranged combat at a spot halfway between the Chateau de Josselin and Ploërmel. The Franco-Breton side eventually won after killing or capturing the English force, including Bramborough. This episode was later known as the Combat of the Thirty.

The Castle of Josselin can still be seen today, although only four of the original nine towers remain after the Cardinal Richelieu ordered the castle partially demolished in 1629.

==Population==

Inhabitants of Josselin are called &quot;Josselinais&quot; in French.
==Breton language==
In 2008, 16.05% of children attended the bilingual schools in primary education.

==Twin towns==
Josselin is twinned with: 
: Alzey, Germany 
: Tard, Hungary
: Brechin, Scotland, UK

<text>Ploërmel (; ; Gallo language: &quot;Pieurmè&quot;) is a commune in the Morbihan department in Brittany, in north-western France. On 1 January 2019, the former commune Monterrein was merged into Ploërmel.

==Character of the town==
The town is both modern and medieval, and has easy access to most parts of Brittany. Ploërmel is set on the edge of the Brocéliande forest, which legend proclaims is the home of Merlin the Magician, amongst other fantastical characters.

==History==
In 1351, during the Breton War of Succession (part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War), the town was occupied by the Montfortist faction, supported by the English. The rival French-supported Blois faction controlled nearby Josselin. Two groups of approximately 30 English and French knights staged a tournament at a spot between the two towns, to show their prowess and make money by capturing opponents. The Franco-Breton team eventually won after killing or capturing the Anglo-Breton force. This was later known as the Combat of the Thirty.

In 1944, 10 Resistance fighters were killed by German soldiers. 31 inhabitants were killed, 125 wounded, by the American air raid on the railway station on 12 June, during the Normandy landings.

On 10 December 2006, the city unveiled a statue of Pope John Paul II. It was a gift by Russo-Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli, and has sparked controversy over the separation of Church and State.

The town gave its name to a monastic order, the Brothers of Ploërmel. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Tom Baker was a monk of the order for a while in Jersey.

In 2008 from 24 May till 1 June 2008 the City of Ploërmel became the first City in France to host the International Federation of Carnival Cities Congress. The Ploërmel Carnival is the largest in central Brittany and is held on Saturdays at the beginning and end of May.

==Population==
Inhabitants of Ploërmel are called &quot;Ploërmelais&quot;. The population data given in the table below refer to the commune in its geography as of January 2020.
==Breton language==
In 2008, just 2.62% of the town&#x27;s children received either Breton-medium or bilingual education.

==Twin towns==
* Cobh, Republic of Ireland
* Apensen, Germany
* Gornau, Germany
* Gorseinon &amp; Llwchwr, Wales
* Kolbuszowa, Poland
* Dabola, Guinea

== Cultural references ==

An 1859 French opéra comique with music by Giacomo Meyerbeer, &quot;Le pardon de Ploërmel&quot; (The Pardon of Ploërmel), was about an annual procession in Ploermel.

Ploërmel was one of the favourite places of the South African-born British female composer, Priaulx Rainier. She evoked the place in her work for winds and percussion, &quot;Ploërmel&quot; (1973).

<text>is a sexual fetishism, specifically a sexualized attraction to the underwear or school uniforms of girls or young women. It is a word of Japanese origin, coined by combining , meaning bloomers, as in the bottoms of gym suits, and , meaning sailor suit, the traditional Japanese school uniforms for schoolgirls; notably kogal. Burusera shops sell girls&#x27; used school uniforms, panties and other fetish items.

==History==
In the 1990s gravure magazines started to feature photos of girls wearing bloomers and school uniforms, some magazines featuring exclusively those types of clothes. Fetish shops selling these types of clothes also started appearing in Japan. Along with loose socks they became the symbol of high-school girls in the 1990s. They are also sometimes worn as cosplay.

==Burusera shops==
Burusera shops sell used girl&#x27;s gym suits and school uniforms. They also sell other goods procured from schoolgirls, e.g. undergarments, school swimsuits for physical education, socks, stationery, sanitary napkins and tampons.
The clothes are often accompanied by ostensibly genuine photos of the girls wearing them. The clients are men who use the items for sexual arousal or stimulation.
Schoolgirls once openly participated in the sale of their used garments, either through burusera shops or using mobile phone sites to sell directly to clients.

==Legal restrictions==
In August 1994, a burusera shop manager who made a schoolgirl under 18 sell her used underwear was arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department on suspicion of violation of article 34 of the &quot;Child Welfare Act&quot; and article 175 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. The police alleged violations of the &quot;Secondhand Articles Dealer Act&quot; which bans the purchase of secondhand goods without authorization.

Child pornography laws imposed legal control over the child porno industry in 1999. However, burusera goods in themselves are not child pornography, and selling burusera goods is a legal way for under 18 schoolgirls to gain extra income. This has been viewed with suspicion as potential child sexual abuse.

Prefectures in Japan began enforcing regulations in 2004 that restricted purchases and sales of used underwear and saliva of people under 18.

<text>Dawn Upshaw (born July 17, 1960) is an American soprano. She is the recipient of several Grammy Awards and has released a number of Edison Award-winning discs; she performs both opera and art song, and her repertoire spans Baroque to contemporary. Many composers, including Henri Dutilleux, Osvaldo Golijov, John Harbison, Esa-Pekka Salonen, John Adams, and Kaija Saariaho, have written for her. In 2007, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. In 2006, she founded the Graduate Vocal Arts Program at Bard College Conservatory in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, serving as artistic director until 2019. She currently serves as head of the Vocal Arts Program at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts.

==Early life==
Dawn Upshaw was born in Nashville, Tennessee. She began singing while attending Rich East High School in Park Forest, Illinois and was the only female ever promoted to the top choir (the Singing Rockets) as a sophomore, according to choir director Douglas Ulreich. She received a B.A. in 1982 from Illinois Wesleyan University, where she studied voice with Dr. David Nott. She went on to study voice with Ellen Faull at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City, earning her M.M. in 1984. She also attended courses given by Jan DeGaetani at the Aspen Music School. She was a winner of the Young Concert Artists International Auditions (1984) and the Walter M. Naumburg Competition (1985), and was a member of the Metropolitan Opera Young Artists Development Program. Since her start in 1984, Upshaw has made more than 300 appearances at the Metropolitan Opera.

==Career==
Upshaw came to international fame with her performance on the million-selling recording (1992), with David Zinman, of Symphony No 3 by Henryk Górecki, known as the &quot;Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot; (&quot;Symfonia pieśni żałosnych&quot;).

She has premiered more than twenty-five new works, notably Henri Dutilleux&#x27;s song-cycle &quot;Correspondances&quot;, and has embraced several pieces created for her, including the Grawemeyer Award-winning opera &quot;L&#x27;Amour de Loin&quot; by Kaija Saariaho, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by John Harbison, the nativity oratorio &quot;El Niño&quot; by John Adams, and Osvaldo Golijov&#x27;s highly acclaimed chamber opera &quot;Ainadamar&quot; and song cycle &quot;Ayre&quot;. In 2009, she premiered David Bruce&#x27;s song cycle &quot;The North Wind was a Woman&quot; at the gala opening of the Chamber Music Society of the Lincoln Centre&#x27;s season.

In addition to her operatic recordings, she has also sung the title role in the first complete recording of the score of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot;. She has also recorded albums of songs by Vernon Duke and Rodgers and Hart. Upshaw was a guest of President of the United States Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton on the NBC special &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot;. The BBC presented a prime-time telecast of her 1996 London Proms Concert, &quot;Dawn at Dusk&quot;, in which she performed songs from American musical theater. Her engagements with James Levine over many years led to a 1997 recording of Claude Debussy songs.

Upshaw appears on an album of Christmas music in association with the male vocal ensemble Chanticleer titled &quot;Christmas with Chanticleer featuring special guest Dawn Upshaw&quot; for Teldec Classics.

Upshaw tours regularly with pianist Gilbert Kalish. Richard Goode and Margo Garrett are also long-standing partners. She has worked with director Peter Sellars many times, including on his staging of Händel&#x27;s &quot;Theodora&quot; at Glyndebourne, his Paris production of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;—as part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Esa-Pekka Salonen&#x27;s month-long residency at the Théâtre du Châtelet, 1996—a staging of Bach&#x27;s cantata &quot;Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut&quot;, BWV 199, presented in the 1995–96 season at New York&#x27;s 92nd Street Y, and the Salzburg Festival production of Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot; (1998). Upshaw has often performed as a soloist at the annual Ojai Music Festival in California; most recently in 2006, 2008, and 2009. In 2011, she was the music director of the festival, where she performed the world premiere of the Peter Sellers-staged production of George Crumb&#x27;s work &quot;Winds of Destiny&quot;. She joined the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra as artistic partner beginning with the 2007–08 season. In 2006, she founded the Graduate Vocal Arts Program at Bard College Conservatory in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, serving as artistic director until 2019, when she was succeeded by Stephanie Blythe. She currently serves as head of the Vocal Arts Program at Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts.

<text>A key stage is a stage of the state education system in England, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar setting the educational knowledge expected of students at various ages. The term is also used in some other autonomous territories such as Hong Kong, and countries such as Australia (some states), although the ages at which each key stage applies differ between countries.

Key Stages in England are often abbreviated as KS (ex. KS1). Each key stage consists of a certain range of school years so there is no key stage for higher education.

In Wales, the new curriculum replaces key stages with &quot;progression steps&quot; at ages 5, 8, 11, 14 and 16, &quot;relating to broad expectations of a child’s progress&quot;.

==Stages==
In England, the stages are as follows:
The national curriculum sets out targets to be achieved in various subject areas at each of the Key Stages.

The Key Stages were first defined in the Education Reform Act 1988 to accompany the first introduction of the national curriculum. The precise definition of each of the main 4 key stages is age-related, incorporating all pupils of a particular age at the beginning of each academic year. The key stages were designed to fit with the most prevalent structures which had already grown up in the education system over the previous 100 years of development.

Prior to the four main key stages, pupils attend a Foundation Stage, the latter part of which is compulsory.

Key Stage 1 fits broadly with the first stage of primary education, often known as infant schools. This break had existed for some time, being acknowledged in the 1931 Hadow Report as &#x27;axiomatic&#x27; by as early as 1870.

Key Stage 2 fits the later stage of primary education, often known as junior schools. Again, described by Sir William Henry Hadow, this took pupils up to the standardised break at age 11.

Secondary education was split between Key Stage 3 &amp; Key Stage 4 at age 14, to align with long-existing two-year examination courses at GCSE level.

Key Stage 5 is the final Key Stage and refers to education for students beyond secondary school aged 16 to 18 participating in sixth form or college.

<text>Christopher Stewart (born 27 March 1951) is a British author who was the original drummer and a founder member of Genesis. When not writing, he runs a farm, where he lives, near Orgiva in Spain.

==Background and musical career==
Stewart was born in Crawley and grew up in Horsham, Sussex. He attended The Abbey School, Ashurst Wood, then later became a classmate of Tony Banks and Peter Gabriel at Charterhouse in Surrey, and joined them in a school band called the Garden Wall. This was joined by classmates Mike Rutherford and Anthony Phillips to form Anon, which was renamed Genesis in January 1967. Stewart appears on Genesis&#x27;s first two singles, &quot;The Silent Sun&quot; / &quot;That&#x27;s Me&quot; and &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; / &quot;One-Eyed Hound&quot;. Although several demos from Stewart&#x27;s time with the band appear on the &quot;Genesis Archive 1967-75&quot; box set, he is not credited with playing on any of them (though one track features drumming that may have been done by Stewart). At the recommendation of Jonathan King, Stewart was – rather inelegantly – fired from the band in the summer of 1968 due to his poor technique and was replaced by John Silver.

==Farmer and author==
After travelling and working throughout Europe, Stewart settled and bought a farm named El Valero in the Alpujarras region of Andalucia, where he lives and works with his wife Ana Exton and daughter Chloë. He ran for the position of local councillor in the 27 May 2007 local elections in Órgiva representing the Green Party, where he received 201 votes (roughly 8 per cent).

He is now known for his autobiographical books, &quot;Driving Over Lemons: An Optimist in Andalucia&quot; (1999, ) and the sequels, &quot;A Parrot In The Pepper Tree&quot; (2002, ) and &quot;The Almond Blossom Appreciation Society&quot; (2006, ), about his life farming in Spain. All three are also available as audiobooks (&quot;Lemons&quot; , &quot;Parrot&quot; , and &quot;Almond&quot; ), narrated by Stewart.

In 2009, Stewart&#x27;s publisher, &quot;Sort of Books&quot;, announced plans to release his memoir focused on sailing, entitled &quot;Three Ways to Capsize a Boat: An Optimist Afloat&quot;. This was fulfilled as .

In 2014, Sort Of Books published Stewart&#x27;s book of stories, &quot;Last Days of the Bus Club&quot; (4 June 2014, ), which focuses on his daughter&#x27;s going to university, and his and Ana&#x27;s subsequent life alone on the farm. Stewart has also contributed to two books in the Rough Guides series: the &quot;Rough Guide to Andalucia&quot; and the &quot;Rough Guide to China&quot;.

<text>A radio documentary is a spoken word radio format devoted to non-fiction narrative. It is broadcast on radio as well as distributed through media such as tape, CD, and podcast. A radio documentary, or feature, covers a topic in depth from one or more perspectives, often featuring interviews, commentary, and sound pictures. A radio feature may include original music compositions and creative sound design or can resemble traditional journalistic radio reporting, but cover an issue in greater depth.

== History ==
=== Origins of Radio Documentary in America ===
The early stages of fiction audio storytelling did not entirely resemble what would later be called radio documentaries. In the 1930s, with radio stations like WNYC entering the airspace, reporters documented real people and real-life scenarios through short on-the-ground interviews rather than dramatization. Other notable documentary broadcasts include unrefined one-shot audio recordings of events, such as the Hindenburg disaster in 1937. By 1939, CBS responded to growing anxieties about immigration in the U.S. with a six-month series, titled &quot;Americans All…Immigrants All,&quot; which highlighted the stories of immigrant communities.

The lack of documentary-style reporting in this era can be attributed, in part, to technological limitations; recording equipment was not easily portable.

=== 1940s in American Radio Documentary ===
An important moment in the establishment of the radio documentary as a widely used and discussed format is the expansion of portable audio recording devices. In 1945, sound archivist and radio producer, Tony Schwartz began to use portable audio recording equipment to collect the sounds of his neighborhood in New York City to share on his WNYC radio show; his features ran for 30 years and grew to include the sounds of daily life recorded by and mailed to him from people around the world. This style of sharing true-life sound bytes would remain in public radio documentary.

In 1946, one of the most pivotal developments in the spread and stylization of radio documentary was the creation of the CBS Documentary Unit. It was the first sector of a major media network dedicated to this format of radio. The unit was &quot;&#x27;devoted exclusively to the production of programs dealing with major domestic and international issues and involving extraordinary research and preparation&#x27;&quot;. Not only did the content deviate from programming that favors advertisers, the style deviated from the standard, creating a well-known format. The style of reporting for the CBS features was adopted and melded by ABC and NBC networks. The format included extensive interviews to gain multiple perspectives on an issue, adherence to journalistic ethics, and often a call to action; the programming was usually released as multiple segments and at peak times. Examples of these first documentary projects include CBS&#x27; 1946 war feature, &quot;The Empty Noose&quot;, and ABC&#x27;s 1949 program, &quot;V.D., A Conspiracy of Silence&quot;, addressing the lack of public attention to venereal disease.

=== 1970s in American Radio Documentary ===
With the founding of National Public Radio in 1971, radio documentary began shifting again due to non-commercial educational media. For a short time, programs such as &quot;All Things Considered&quot; explored creative styles of presenting non-fiction by deviating from now-traditional styles of radio documentary by hiring reporters outside of the radio sphere.

=== 1990s-present in American Radio Documentary ===
Important shifts in technology have allowed radio documentary to travel beyond analog. With the advent of podcasting and internet radio, the FCC provides no guidelines for these media. Programs are allowed to skirt FCC regulation, marking yet another shift in the content and style of documentary programming. Current features that exemplify the new possibilities opened by podcasting include the often gritty subject matter of Love + Radio and the critical success of the podcast Serial due to the ability of listeners across the globe to access the content for free.

==Radio documentary in developing nations==
There has been tremendous interest in the field of radio documentaries, particularly in developing nations such as India, Iran, South Korea and Malaysia. In India, for example, radio documentary is gaining in popularity due to their flexibility, efficiency and accessibility to the masses. Producers such as Chitra Narain and Danish Iqbal have been accredited with its revival and popularity in the region. Danish Iqbal who is primarily a drama producer combined the elements of dramatic narrative to produce some memorable radio documentaries. His documentary &quot;Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai&quot; is considered a classic for the use of effective narrative and ambient sounds. This documentary presents an account of unseen bridges between a Kashmiri Shikarah Wala and his auto rickshaw driver friend in Delhi. Although they never met each other their unseen bond is the subject of this rare Documentary which transcends the barriers of political, religious and regional prejudices.

Because both Chitra and Danish had a long tenure at Delhi and had a creative collaboration with many media institutes, their influence is seminal in shaping the thinking of many of their students and co-workers. Danish won twice the prestigious Public Service Broadcasting Award for his documentaries.

<text>OpenVPN is a virtual private network (VPN) system that implements techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It implements both client and server applications.

OpenVPN allows peers to authenticate each other using pre-shared secret keys, certificates or username/password. When used in a multiclient-server configuration, it allows the server to release an authentication certificate for every client, using signatures and certificate authority.

It uses the OpenSSL encryption library extensively, as well as the TLS protocol, and contains many security and control features. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators (NATs) and firewalls.

OpenVPN has been ported and embedded to several systems. For example, DD-WRT has the OpenVPN server function. SoftEther VPN, a multi-protocol VPN server, also has an implementation of OpenVPN protocol.

It was written by James Yonan and is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2). Additionally, commercial licenses are available.

==Architecture==

===Encryption===

OpenVPN uses the OpenSSL library to provide encryption of both the data and control channels. It lets OpenSSL do all the encryption and authentication work, allowing OpenVPN to use all the ciphers available in the OpenSSL package. It can also use the HMAC packet authentication feature to add an additional layer of security to the connection (referred to as an &quot;HMAC Firewall&quot; by the creator). It can also use hardware acceleration to get better encryption performance. Support for mbed TLS is available starting from version 2.3.

===Authentication===

OpenVPN has several ways to authenticate peers with each other. OpenVPN offers pre-shared keys, certificate-based, and username/password-based authentication. Preshared secret key is the easiest, and certificate-based is the most robust and feature-rich. In version 2.0 username/password authentications can be enabled, both with or without certificates. However, to make use of username/password authentications, OpenVPN depends on third-party modules.

===Networking===

OpenVPN can run over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) transports, multiplexing created SSL tunnels on a single TCP/UDP port (RFC 3948 for UDP). 

From 2.3.x series on, OpenVPN fully supports IPv6 as protocol of the virtual network inside a tunnel and the OpenVPN applications can also establish connections via IPv6.
It has the ability to work through most proxy servers (including HTTP) and is good at working through network address translation (NAT) and getting out through firewalls. The server configuration has the ability to &quot;push&quot; certain network configuration options to the clients. These include IP addresses, routing commands, and a few connection options. OpenVPN offers two types of interfaces for networking via the Universal TUN/TAP driver. It can create either a layer-3 based IP tunnel (TUN), or a layer-2 based Ethernet TAP that can carry any type of Ethernet traffic. OpenVPN can optionally use the LZO compression library to compress the data stream. Port 1194 is the official IANA assigned port number for OpenVPN. Newer versions of the program now default to that port. A feature in the 2.0 version allows for one process to manage several simultaneous tunnels, as opposed to the original &quot;one tunnel per process&quot; restriction on the 1.x series.

OpenVPN&#x27;s use of common network protocols (TCP and UDP) makes it a desirable alternative to IPsec in situations where an ISP may block specific VPN protocols in order to force users to subscribe to a higher-priced, &quot;business grade&quot; service tier. For example, Comcast previously declared that their @Home product was, and had always been, designated as a residential service and did not allow the use of commercial applications. Their argument was that conducting remote work via a VPN can adversely affect the network performance of their regular residential subscribers. They offered an alternative, @Home Professional, this would cost more than @Home product. So, anyone wishing to use VPN would have to subscribe to higher-priced, business-grade service tier.

When OpenVPN uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) transports to establish a tunnel, performance will be acceptable only as long as there is sufficient excess bandwidth on the un-tunneled network link to guarantee that the tunneled TCP timers do not expire. If this becomes untrue, performance falls off dramatically due to the TCP meltdown problem.

===Security===

OpenVPN offers various internal security features. It has up to 256-bit encryption through the OpenSSL library, although some service providers may offer lower rates, effectively providing some of the fastest VPN available to consumers. OpenVPN also supports Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), which regenerates encryption keys at set intervals, ensuring that even if one key is compromised, previous and future data remains secure. Additionally, OpenVPN can be configured with various encryption ciphers, such as ChaCha20 and AES-256. It runs in userspace instead of requiring IP stack (therefore kernel) operation. OpenVPN has the ability to drop root privileges, use mlockall to prevent swapping sensitive data to disk, enter a chroot jail after initialization, and apply a SELinux context after initialization.

OpenVPN runs a custom security protocol based on SSL and TLS, rather than supporting IKE, IPsec, L2TP or PPTP.

OpenVPN offers support of smart cards via PKCS#11-based cryptographic tokens.

===Extensibility===

OpenVPN can be extended with third-party plug-ins or scripts, which can be called at defined entry points. The purpose of this is often to extend OpenVPN with more advanced logging, enhanced authentication with username and passwords, dynamic firewall updates, RADIUS integration and so on. The plug-ins are dynamically loadable modules, usually written in C, while the scripts interface can execute any scripts or binaries available to OpenVPN. In the OpenVPN source code there are some examples of such plug-ins, including a PAM authentication plug-in. Several third-party plug-ins also exist to authenticate against LDAP or SQL databases such as SQLite and MySQL.

===Header===

==Platforms==

It is available on Solaris, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, QNX, macOS and Windows XP and later. OpenVPN is available for mobile operating systems including Maemo, Windows Mobile 6.5 and below, iOS 3GS+ devices, jailbroken iOS 3.1.2+ devices, Android 4.0+ devices, and Android devices that have had the Cyanogenmod aftermarket firmware flashed or have the correct kernel module installed. It is not compatible with some mobile phone OSes, including Palm OS. It is not a &quot;web-based&quot; VPN shown as a web page such as Citrix or Terminal Services Web access; the program is installed independently and configured by editing text files manually, rather than through a GUI-based wizard. OpenVPN is not compatible with VPN clients that use the IPsec over L2TP or PPTP protocols. The entire package consists of one binary for both client and server connections, an optional configuration file, and one or more key files depending on the authentication method used.

===Firmware implementations===

OpenVPN has been integrated into several router firmware packages allowing users to run OpenVPN in client or server mode from their network routers. A router running OpenVPN in client mode, for example, allows any device on a network to access a VPN without needing the capability to install OpenVPN.

Notable firmware packages with OpenVPN integration include:

OpenVPN has also been implemented in some manufacturer router firmware.

===Software implementations===

OpenVPN has been integrated into SoftEther VPN, an open-source multi-protocol VPN server, to allow users to connect to the VPN server from existing OpenVPN clients.

OpenVPN is also integrated into Vyos, an open-source routing operating system forked from the Vyatta software router.

==Licensing==

OpenVPN is available in two versions:

*OpenVPN Community Edition, which is a free and open-source version
*OpenVPN Access Server (OpenVPN-AS) is based on the Community Edition, but provides additional paid and proprietary features like LDAP integration, SMB server, Web UI management and provides a set of installation and configuration tools that are reported to simplify the rapid deployment of a VPN remote-access solution. The Access Server edition relies heavily on iptables for load balancing and it has never been available on Windows for this reason. This version is also able to dynamically create client (&quot;OpenVPN Connect&quot;) installers, which include a client profile for connecting to a particular Access Server instance. However, the user does not need to have an Access Server client in order to connect to the Access Server instance; the client from the OpenVPN Community Edition can be used.

<text>Edmond Jules Isidore Leburton (18 April 1915 – 15 June 1997) was a Belgian politician who served as the prime minister of Belgium from 1973 to 1974.

He first entered Parliament representing Huy, Belgium.

==Prime Minister of Belgium==

Leburton served as the Prime Minister of Belgium from January 1973 to April 1974. A number of reforms were carried out under Leburton&#x27;s government, including a law on &#x27;prolonged minority&#x27; (June 1973) to safeguard people with mental disabilities, the introduction of annual adjustments to pensions to the level of economic prosperity (March 1973), and the passage of an Act which strengthened the rights of tenants (November 1973). In addition, improvements were made to various social welfare benefits. He was the last native French speaker to hold that office, disregarding the bilingual Paul Vanden Boeynants from Brussels, until Elio Di Rupo took office in December 2011. He was a member of the Socialist Party. Leburton was also the last member of that party to hold the office of Prime Minister until Elio Di Rupo.

==Personal life==
On 20 December 1947, Leburton married Charlotte (Joniaux) (born 20 August 1922 and died 17 september 2020) and had two sons, Jean-Pierre (born 4 March 1949), and Eddy (born 28 July 1951).
He died on 15 June 1997 in Waremme, aged 82.

<text>The Garo National Council is a political party in Meghalaya in northeastern India which campaigns for the creation a new Indian state to be called Garoland, for the people of the Garo Hills. 

Founded in February 1946 as the Garo National Conference, Moody K Marak was the first President. In 1948 the organisation was renamed the Garo National Council. The GNC was a founding member of the All Party Hill Leaders Conference (APHLC).

In 1998, the GNC was successful in electing Clifford Marak to the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly. Marak lost in 2003, but regained a seat in 2013 (he died in March 2015).

The GNC is a member of the Garo Hills State Movement Committee (GHSMC), a coalition of groups supporting the separate state of Garoland.

<doc id="858507" wikidata="Q2213906" url="?curid=858507" title="Self-referential humor">
<text>Self-referential humor, also known as self-reflexive humor, self-aware humor, or meta humor, is a type of comedic expression that—either directed toward some other subject, or openly directed toward itself—is self-referential in some way, intentionally alluding to the very person who is expressing the humor in a comedic fashion, or to some specific aspect of that same comedic expression. Here, &quot;meta&quot; is used to describe that the joke explicitly talks about other jokes, a usage similar to the words metadata (data about data), metatheatrics (a play within a play as in &quot;Hamlet&quot;) and metafiction. Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and surrealistically is a form of bathos. In general, self-referential humor often uses hypocrisy, oxymoron, or paradox to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience.

==History==
Old Comedy of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. Aristophanes, whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience&#x27;s approval.

Douglas Hofstadter wrote several books on the subject of self-reference; the term &quot;meta&quot; has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential.

==Meta-jokes==

Meta-jokes are a popular form of humor. They contain several somewhat different, but related categories: &quot;joke templates&quot;, &quot;class-referential jokes&quot;, &quot;self-referential jokes&quot; and &quot;jokes about jokes&quot;.

===Joke template===
This form of meta-joke is a sarcastic jab at the endless refitting of joke forms (often by professional comedians) to different circumstances or characters without a significant innovation in the humor.


===Class-referential jokes===
This form of meta-joke contains a familiar class of jokes as part of the joke. For example, here are a few subversions of the standard bar joke format: 


===Self-referential jokes===
Self-referential jokes refer to themselves rather than to larger classes of previous jokes.


===Jokes about jokes===
Marc Galanter, in the introduction to his book &quot;Lowering the Bar: Lawyer Jokes and Legal Culture&quot;, cites a meta-joke in a speech of Chief Justice William Rehnquist:
I&#x27;ve often started off with a lawyer joke, a complete caricature of a lawyer who&#x27;s been nasty, greedy, and unethical. But I&#x27;ve stopped that practice. I gradually realized that the lawyers in the audience didn&#x27;t think the jokes were funny and the non-lawyers didn&#x27;t know they were jokes.

Stand-up comedian Mitch Hedberg would often follow up a joke with an admission that it was poorly told, or insist to the audience that &quot;that joke was funnier than you acted.&quot; 

The process of being a humorist is also the subject of meta-jokes; for example, on an episode of &quot;QI&quot;, Jimmy Carr made the comment, &quot;When I told them I wanted to be a comedian, they laughed. Well, they&#x27;re not laughing now!&quot;— a joke previously associated with Bob Monkhouse.

==Other examples==

===Fumblerules===
Fumblerules are stylistic guidelines, presented such that the phrasing of the rule itself constitutes an infraction. For example, &quot;Don&#x27;t use no double negatives&quot;.

===Limericks===
A limerick referring to the anti-humor of limericks:

W. S. Gilbert wrote one of the definitive &quot;anti-limericks&quot;:

Tom Stoppard&#x27;s anti-limerick from &quot;Travesties&quot;:
A limerick about limericks:
===Metaparody===
Metaparody is a form of humor or literary technique consisting &quot;parodying the parody of the original&quot;, sometimes to the degree that the viewer is unclear as to which subtext is genuine and which subtext parodic. An example of a Metaparody would be the film &quot;Scary Movie&quot; which parodies the film &quot;Scream&quot; which is itself a parody.

===RAS Syndrome===
RAS syndrome is the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words. &quot;RAS&quot; stands for Redundant Acronym Syndrome and so &quot;RAS syndrome&quot; is self-referencing.

<text>Roland Mesnier (July 8, 1944 – August 26, 2022) was a French-born American pastry chef and culinary writer. His creations during his twenty-five years as Executive Pastry Chef (1980–2004) at the White House earned him the reputation of a creative genius.

==Career==
Mesnier was born into a family of nine children in the village of Bonnay, France. He first became interested in becoming a chef when he visited his brother&#x27;s pastry shop in a nearby city. When he was fourteen, his mother secured an apprenticeship for him at a pastry shop in Besançon. He worked from 6am to 8pm six days a week, and in exchange received 300 francs a month, plus room and board, in addition to cooking lessons.

Like most young apprentices, Mesnier was at first given only menial tasks, such as grocery shopping, to see whether he was truly interested in learning the profession. Mesnier stayed on and eventually was taught how to make cakes, croissants, and brioche. He also was first exposed to puff pastry and chocolate molding, which laid the groundwork for his future specialties. At 17 he passed his apprenticeship exam and began to look for work that would enhance both his skills and his reputation.

Eventually he found his way to Paris, working in a restaurant and pastry shop near the Opéra Garnier. He soon mastered all there was to learn in Paris, and on the advice of his employer he went to West Germany, where techniques were more advanced. Mesnier lived in Hamburg and Hanover and learned marzipan modeling along with how to make cakes, cookies, and fondants, as well as the German and English languages.

Mesnier was hired as White House pastry chef in 1979 by First Lady Rosalynn Carter, and retired on July 30, 2004.

In 2011, Mesnier endorsed a number of products for Panpan Food () in Fujian Province, China, and recorded several commercials that were broadcast during the advertising time of mainland Chinese TV stations.

==Personal life and death==
In 1967, while he was working in Bermuda, Mesnier met his wife, Martha Whiteford, a teacher from West Virginia. Together they had a son.

After retiring, Mesnier wrote a book about his White House experiences, titled &quot;All the President&#x27;s Pastries&quot; (2007).

A short time before his death, Mesnier entered an assisted-living facility in Burke, Virginia, where he died of cancer on August 26, 2022, at the age of 78.

<doc id="858509" wikidata="Q137998" url="?curid=858509" title="Schindleria brevipinguis">
<text>Schindleria brevipinguis is a species of marine fish in family Gobiidae of Perciformes. Known as the stout infantfish, it is native to Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef and to Osprey Reef in the Coral Sea.

==Anatomy==
&quot;S. brevipinguis&quot; is among the smallest known fish in the world, together with species such as &quot;Paedocypris progenetica&quot;. Males of &quot;S. brevipinguis&quot; have an average standard length of , a gravid female was and the maximum standard length of the species is . It held the record for the smallest known vertebrate, but now, by a measurement of snout-to-vent length, the smallest vertebrate species currently is the recently (Jan 2012) described frog &quot;Paedophryne amauensis&quot;, while the parasitic males of the anglerfish &quot;Photocorynus spiniceps&quot; are but long. &quot;S. brevipinguis&quot; is distinguished from the similar &quot;S. praematura&quot; by having its first anal-fin ray further forward, under dorsal-fin 4, rather than 7–11 in &quot;S. praematura&quot;. Like most closely related fishes, the fish is very thin, and one specimen weighed just 0.7 milligrams.

==Taxonomy==
The specific epithet, &quot;brevipinguis,&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;brevis&quot; (short) and &quot;pinguis&quot; (stout), in reference to the fish&#x27;s shorter, thicker body, as compared with other &quot;Schindleria&quot; species.

The first specimen was collected by Jeff Leis in 1979, but the species was not formally described until a 2004 paper (Watson and Walker).

<doc id="858511" wikidata="Q833899" url="?curid=858511" title="Butler">
<text>A butler is a person who works in a house serving and is a domestic worker in a large household. In great houses, the household is sometimes divided into departments, with the butler in charge of the dining room, wine cellar, and pantry. Some also have charge of the entire parlour floor and housekeepers caring for the entire house and its appearance. A butler is usually male and in charge of male servants, while a housekeeper is usually female and in charge of female servants. Traditionally, male servants (such as footmen) were better-paid and of higher status than female servants. The butler, as the senior male servant, has the highest servant status. He can also sometimes function as a chauffeur. 

In older houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as &quot;majordomo&quot;, &quot;butler administrator&quot;, &quot;house manager&quot;, &quot;manservant&quot;, &quot;staff manager&quot;, &quot;chief of staff&quot;, &quot;staff captain&quot;, &quot;estate manager&quot;, and &quot;head of household staff&quot; are sometimes given. The precise duties of the employee will vary to some extent in line with the title given but, perhaps more importantly, in line with the requirements of the individual employer. In the grandest homes or when the employer owns more than one residence, there is sometimes an estate manager of higher rank than the butler. The butler can also be assisted by a head footman or footboy called the under-butler.

==Background==

The word &quot;butler&quot; comes from Anglo-Norman &quot;buteler&quot;, a variant form of Old Norman &quot;*butelier&quot;, corresponding to Old French &quot;botellier&quot; &#x27;officer in charge of the king&#x27;s wine bottles&#x27;, derived from &quot;boteille&quot; &#x27;bottle&#x27; (Modern French &quot;bouteille)&quot;, itself from Gallo-Romance &#x27;bottle&#x27;. For centuries, the butler has been the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages, which in ancient times might have represented a considerable portion of the household&#x27;s assets and led to the position becoming chief steward of a household.
In Britain, the butler was originally a middle-ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the butler gradually became the senior, usually male, member of a household&#x27;s staff in the very grandest households. However, there was sometimes a steward who ran the outside estate and financial affairs, rather than just the household, and who was senior to the butler in social status into the 19th century. Butlers used always to be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.

A &quot;silverman&quot; or &quot;silver butler&quot; has expertise and professional knowledge of the management, secure storage, use and cleaning of all silverware, associated tableware and other paraphernalia for use at military and other special functions.

==Origin and history== 

The modern role of the butler has evolved from earlier roles that were generally concerned with the care and serving of alcoholic beverages.

===Ancient through medieval eras===

From ancient through medieval times, alcoholic beverages were chiefly stored first in earthenware vessels, then later in wooden barrels, rather than in glass bottles; these containers would have been an important part of a household&#x27;s possessions. The care of these assets was therefore generally reserved for trusted slaves, although the job could also go to free persons because of heredity-based class lines or the inheritance of trades.

The biblical book of Genesis contains a reference to a role precursive to modern butlers. The early Hebrew Joseph interpreted a dream of Pharaoh&#x27;s שקה (shaqah) (literally &quot;to give to drink&quot;), which is most often translated into English as &quot;chief butler&quot; or &quot;chief cup-bearer.&quot;

In ancient Greece and Rome, it was nearly always slaves who were charged with the care and service of wine, while during the Medieval Era the &quot;pincerna&quot; filled the role within the noble court. The English word &quot;butler&quot; itself comes from the Middle English word &quot;bo(u)teler&quot; (and several other forms), from Anglo-Norman &quot;buteler&quot;, itself from Old Norman &quot;butelier&quot;, corresponding to Old French &quot;botellier&quot; (&quot;bottle bearer&quot;), Modern French &quot;bouteiller&quot;, and before that from Medieval Latin &quot;butticula&quot;. The modern English &quot;butler&quot; thus relates both to bottles and casks.

Eventually the European butler emerged as a middle-ranking member of the servants of a great house, in charge of the &quot;buttery&quot; (originally a storeroom for &quot;butts&quot; of liquor, although the term later came to mean a general storeroom or pantry). While this is so for household butlers, those with the same title but in service to the Crown enjoyed a position of administrative power and were only minimally involved with various stores.
===Elizabethan through Victorian eras===
The &quot;steward&quot; of the Elizabethan era was more akin to the butler that later emerged. Gradually, throughout the 19th century and particularly the Victorian era, as the number of butlers and other domestic servants greatly increased in various countries, the butler became a senior male servant of a household&#x27;s staff. By this time he was in charge of the more modern &quot;wine cellar&quot;, the &quot;buttery&quot; or &quot;pantry&quot; (from French &quot;pain&quot; from Latin &quot;panis&quot;, bread) as it came to be called, which supplied bread, butter, cheese, and other basic provisions, and the &quot;ewery&quot;, which contained napkins and basins for washing and shaving. In the very grandest households there was sometimes an Estate Steward or other senior steward who oversaw the butler and his duties. &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot;, a manual published in Britain in 1861, reported:

The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position of the master, from the owner of the ducal mansion, with a retinue of attendants, at the head of which is the chamberlain and house-steward, to the occupier of the humbler house, where a single footman, or even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only male retainer. The majority of gentlemen&#x27;s establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery, or butler, a footman, and coachman, or coachman and groom, where the horses exceed two or three.

Butlers were head of a strict service hierarchy and therein held a position of power and respect. They were more managerial than &quot;hands on&quot;—more so than serving, they officiated in service. For example, although the butler was at the door to greet and announce the arrival of a formal guest, the door was actually &quot;opened&quot; by a footman, who would receive the guest&#x27;s hat and coat. Even though the butler helped his employer into his coat, this had been handed to him by a footman. However, even the highest-ranking butler would &quot;pitch in&quot; when necessary, such as during a staff shortage, to ensure that the household ran smoothly, although some evidence suggests this was so even during normal times.

The household itself was generally divided into areas of responsibility. The butler was in charge of the dining room, the wine cellar, pantry, and sometimes the entire main floor. Directly under the butler was the &quot;first footman&quot; (or &quot;head footman&quot;), although there could also be a &quot;deputy butler&quot; or &quot;under-butler&quot; who would fill in as butler during the butler&#x27;s illness or absence. The &quot;footman&quot;‒there were frequently numerous young men in the role within a household‒ performed a range of duties including serving meals, attending doors, carrying or moving heavy items, and they often doubled as &quot;valets&quot;. Valets themselves performed a variety of personal duties for their employer. Butlers engaged and directed all these junior staff and each reported directly to him. The &quot;housekeeper&quot; was in charge of the house as a whole and its appearance. In a household without an official head housekeeper, female servants and kitchen staff were also directly under the butler&#x27;s management, while in smaller households, the butler usually doubled as valet. Employers and their children and guests addressed the butler (and under-butler, if there was one) by last name alone; fellow servants, retainers, and tradespersons as &quot;Mr. [Surname]&quot;.

Butlers were typically hired by the master of the house but usually reported to its lady. Beeton in her manual suggested a GBP 25–50 (US$2,675‒5,350) per-year salary for butlers; room and board and livery clothing were additional benefits, and tipping known as &quot;vails&quot;, were common.
The few butlers who were married had to make separate housing arrangements for their families, as did all other servants within the hierarchy.

===In the early United States===

From the beginning of slavery in the United States, in the early 17th century, African Americans were put to task as domestic servants. Some eventually became butlers. Gary Puckrein, a social historian, argues that those used in particularly affluent homes authentically internalised the sorts of &quot;refined&quot; norms and personal attributes that would reflect highly upon the social stature of their masters or mistresses. One of the first books written and published through a commercial U.S. publisher by an African American was by a butler named Robert Roberts. The book, &quot;The House Servant&#x27;s Directory,&quot; first published in 1827, is essentially a manual for butlers and waiters, and is called by Puckrein &quot;the most remarkable book by an African American in antebellum United States&quot;. The book generated such interest that a second edition was published in 1828, and a third in 1843.

European indentured servants formed a corps of domestic workers from which butlers were eventually drawn. Although not the victims of institutionalised slavery, many of them had not volunteered for domestic service, but were forced into it by indebtedness or coercion. As with African American slaves, they could rise in domestic service, and their happiness or misery depended greatly on the disposition of their masters.

===The modern butler===
Beginning around the early 1920s (following World War I), employment in domestic service occupations began a sharp overall decline in western European countries, and even more markedly in the United States. Even so, there were still around 30,000 butlers employed in Britain by World War II. As few as one hundred were estimated to remain by the mid-1980s. Social historian Barry Higman argues that a high number of domestic workers within a society correlates with a high level of socio-economic inequality. Conversely, as a society undergoes levelling among its social classes, the number employed in domestic service declines.

Following varied shifts and changes accompanying accelerated globalisation beginning in the late 1980s, overall global demand for butlers since the turn of the millennium has risen dramatically. According to Charles MacPherson, President of Charles MacPherson Associates and owner of The Charles MacPherson Academy for Butlers and Household Managers, the proximate cause is that the number of millionaires and billionaires has increased in recent years, and such people are finding that they desire assistance in managing their households. MacPherson emphasises that the number of wealthy people in China has increased particularly, creating in that country a high demand for professional butlers who have been trained in the European butlering tradition. There is also increasing demand for such butlers in other Asian countries, India, and the petroleum-rich Middle East.

Higman additionally argues that the inequality/equality levels of societies are a major determinant of the nature of the domestic servant/employer relationship. As the 21st century approached, many butlers began carrying out an increasing number of duties formerly reserved for more junior household servants. Butlers today may be called upon to do whatever household and personal duties their employers deem fitting, in the goal of freeing their employers to carry out their own personal and professional affairs. Professional butler and author Steven M. Ferry states that the image of tray-wielding butlers who specialise in serving tables and decanting wine is now anachronistic, and that employers may well be more interested in a butler who is capable of managing a full array of household affairs‒from providing the traditional dinner service, to acting as valet, to managing high-tech systems and multiple homes with complexes of staff. While in truly grand houses the modern butler may still function exclusively as a top-ranked household affairs manager, in lesser homes, such as those of dual-income middle-class professionals, they perform a full array of household and personal assistant duties, including mundane housekeeping. Butlers today may also be situated within corporate settings, embassies, cruise ships, yachts, or within their own small &quot;Rent-a-Butler&quot; business or similar agency.

Along with these changes of scope and context, butlering attire has changed. Whereas butlers have traditionally worn a special uniform that separated them from junior servants, and although this is still often the case, butlers today may wear more casual clothing geared for climate, while exchanging it for formal business attire only upon special service occasions. There are cultural distinctions, as well. In the United States, butlers may frequently don a polo shirt and slacks, while in Bali they typically wear sarongs.

In 2007, the number of butlers in Britain had risen to an estimated 5,000. That number rose to 10,000 by 2014, consistent with increased worldwide demand.

==Training==
Butlers traditionally learned their position while progressing their way up the service ladder. For example, in the documentary &quot;The Authenticity of Gosford Park&quot;, retired butler Arthur Inch (born 1915) describes starting as a hall boy. While this is still often the case, numerous private butlering schools exist today. Additionally, major up-market hotels such as the Ritz-Carlton offer traditional butler training, while some hotels have trained a sort of pseudo-butler for service in defined areas such as &quot;technology butlers&quot;, who fix guests&#x27; computers and other electronic devices, and &quot;bath butlers&quot; who draw custom baths.

==Gender and butlering==
Butlers have traditionally been male, and this remains the norm. Probably the first mention of a female butler is in the 1892 book &quot;Interludes being Two Essays, a Story, and Some Verses&quot; by Horace Smith. In it Smith quotes the noted writer and Anglican clergyman Sydney Smith, who between 1809 and 1829 struggled to make ends meet in a poorly paid assignment to a rural parish in Yorkshire:

&quot;I turned schoolmaster to educate my son, as I could not afford to send him to school. Mrs. Sydney turned schoolmistress to educate my girls as I could not afford a governess. I turned farmer as I could not let my land. A man servant was too expensive, so I caught up a little garden girl, made like a milestone, christened her Bunch, put a napkin in her hand, and made her my butler. The girls taught her to read, Mrs. Sydney to wait, and I undertook her morals. Bunch became the best butler in the country.

Today, female butlers are sometimes preferred, especially for work within West Asian and Southeast Asian families where there may be religious objections for men to work closely with women in a household. Western female celebrities may also prefer a female butler, as may households where the wife is driving the decision to hire a butler. Despite these trends, the Ivor Spencer School asserts that female butlers are not easily placed, on the whole.

In ancient times, the roles precursive to butlering were reserved for chattel or those confined within heredity-based class structures. With the advent of the medieval era, butlering became an opportunity for social advancement‒even more so during Victorian times. Although still based upon various antecedent roles as manifested during different eras, butlering today has frequently taken over many of the roles formerly reserved for lower-ranking domestic servants. At the same time it has become a potentially lucrative career option.

==Notable butlers==
* Eugene Allen, White House butler who served under seven U.S. presidents
* Leslie Bartlett, butler, toastmaster; and founder of The London School of British Butlers
* Paul Burrell, butler to Diana, Princess of Wales
* Alonzo Fields, White House chief butler from 1932 to 1953
* Grant Harrold butler to King Charles III, then-Prince of Wales, from 2004 to 2011
* Naoyuki Arai, The founder and CEO of Butler &amp; Concierge Japan Inc., a butler service company in Japan, and the representative director of General Incorporated Foundation Butler Association Japan

==In visual art== 

Butlers have been occasionally depicted in visual art. A famous painting, &quot;Heads of Six of Hogarth&#x27;s Servants&quot; (c. 1758), is unique among such works. In it, the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth depicted his household servants, all surrounding the butler. In showing the group in a close-knit assemblage rather than in the performance of their routine household duties, Hogarth sought to humanise and dignify them in a manner akin to wealthy-class members, who were the normal subjects of such portraits. While this was a subversive act that certainly raised many eyebrows in his day‒Hogarth conspicuously displayed the work in his estate home in full view of guests‒at the same time he had painted his servants&#x27; facial expressions to convey the sincerity and deference expected of servant-class members.

In contemporary art, &quot;The Butler&#x27;s in Love&quot; series by U.S. artist Mark Stock is especially poignant. In the series, Stock portrays the butler as sick with love, but the possibility of fulfillment is hopeless: the love is a forbidden love, perhaps felt for the lady of the house, and so it must be suffered alone in silent concealment. In addition to the ongoing mannerisms and facial expressions of the butler, a seated lady once appearing in a curtained room and a recurring lipstick-stained absinthe glass over which the butler obsesses provide the interpretive clues. In selecting a butler as his subject, Stock sought to provide a &quot;universal character&quot;, a pathos-laden figure that could be widely related to and that could depict the universality of loneliness felt by someone who can only look in from the outside. Stock began the series in 1985 to express his difficult feelings during a personal experience of unrequited love. One of the paintings was inspiration for a 3-D short film, &quot;The Butler&#x27;s in Love&quot; by actor/director David Arquette, shot in 2008 at San Francisco&#x27;s historic Westerfield Mansion. 

==In fiction==

The real-life modern butler attempts to be discreet and unobtrusive, friendly but not familiar, keenly anticipative of the needs of his or her employer, and graceful and precise in execution of duty. The butler of fiction, by contrast, often tends to be larger than life and has become a plot device in literature and a traditional role in the performing arts. Butlers may provide comic relief with wry comments, clues as to the perpetrators of various crimes, and are represented as at least as intelligent and moral as their “betters,” or even more so. They are often portrayed as being serious and expressionless and in the case that the wealthy hero is an orphan‒such as Batman, Chrono Crusade&#x27;s Satella Harvenheit, or Tomb Raider&#x27;s Lara Croft‒may be a father figure to said hero. Regardless of the genre in which they are cast, butlers in fiction almost invariably follow the &quot;British butler&quot; model and are given an appropriate-sounding surname. The fictional butler tends to be given a typical Anglo-Celtic surname and have an English accent. The Asian, African American, or Caribbean houseboy is a variant, but even these major-domos are based on the British icon.

Today, butlers are usually portrayed as being refined and well-spoken. However, in 19th century fiction such as &quot;Dracula&quot;, butlers generally spoke with a strong Cockney or other regional accent.

&quot;The butler&quot; is integral to the plot of countless potboilers and melodramas, whether or not the character has been given a name. Butlers figure so prominently in period pieces and whodunits that they can be considered stock characters in film and theatre, where a catchphrase is &quot;The butler did it!&quot;

The best-known fictional manservant, and the archetype of the quintessential British butler, is himself not a butler at all but instead a valet: Reginald Jeeves, the iconic creation of author P. G. Wodehouse, is a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s gentleman&quot; and general factotum. Probably the best-known fictional butlers are Alfred from the &quot;Batman&quot; comic and films; Hudson of Upstairs, Downstairs television fame; Mr Carson from the Downton Abbey television series; and Crichton from J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;. Lesser-knowns include Mr. Belvedere from the novel &quot;Belvedere&quot;, which was adapted into a feature film with sequels and later a television series; Lurch, from the television series &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, based on Charles Addams&#x27; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; cartoons; Beach, from the Wodehouse series about Blandings Castle; Niles, the butler at the Sheffield house in American sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot;, Geoffrey from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Bailey (an English canine butler) from the children&#x27;s animated television series &quot;Arthur&quot; and Benson from the two series &quot;Soap&quot; and &quot;Benson&quot;.

Not all fictional butlers portray the &quot;butler stereotype&quot;, however. Alan Bates, who played the butler Jennings in the film &quot;Gosford Park&quot; was coached in brooding detail by Arthur Inch, a longtime real-life butler. Mr. Stevens, the butler played by Anthony Hopkins in the film &quot;Remains of the Day&quot;, was also acted with remarkable realism. A female butler, Sarah Stevens, is the principal character in Linda Howard&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Dying to Please&quot;, a murder/romance novel. Howard gives detailed and generally accurate descriptions of butlering in the work.

===Examples===
* Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s butler from Batman
* Angus Hudson, from the television show &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; 
* Edwin Jarvis, Tony Stark&#x27;s butler from Iron Man 
* Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; 
* Sebastian Beach, from the Blandings Castle stories by P. G. Wodehouse, frequently conspires with the clever Gally Threepwood

<doc id="858518" wikidata="Q5297138" url="?curid=858518" title="Doomwatch">
<text>Doomwatch is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC, which ran on BBC1 between 1970 and 1972. The series was set in the then present day, and dealt with a scientific government agency led by Doctor Spencer Quist (played by John Paul), responsible for investigating and combating various environmental and technological dangers.

The series was followed by a film adaptation produced by Tigon British Film Productions and released in 1972, and a revival TV film was broadcast on Channel 5 in 1999.

==Background==
The programme was created by Gerry Davis and Kit Pedler, who had previously collaborated on scripts for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a programme on which, for a time during the late 1960s, Davis had been the story editor and Pedler the unofficial scientific adviser. Their interest in the problems of science changing and endangering human life had led them to create the popular cyborg villains the Cybermen for that programme. Similar interests led them to create &quot;Doomwatch&quot;, which explored new and unusual threats to the human race, many bred out of the fear of real scientific concepts, with a &quot;this could happen to us&quot; angle.

==Synopsis==
The formal name of the protagonist&#x27;s organization was &quot;Department for the Observation and Measurement of Scientific Work&quot;. Officially Doomwatch was an agency dedicated to preserving the world from dangers of unprincipled scientific research. In the words of one character, &quot;We were set up to investigate any scientific research, public or private, which could possibly be harmful to man.&quot; Its actual intended purpose was to form a body with little power meant in order to stifle public protest and secure green votes. However, the incorruptible Spencer Quist and his allies soon gave the agency some actual power and influence.

Quist had worked on the development of the atomic bomb and seen his wife die of radiation poisoning; Ridge was the secret agent type and Wren a conscientious researcher. Together they took science into people&#x27;s living rooms, explaining about embryo research, subliminal messages, wonder drugs, dumping of toxic waste, noise pollution, nuclear weaponry, animal exploitation, etc.

Storylines included a genetic mutation that created a particularly large and vicious race of rats, and a virus that ate away at all types of plastics, causing aeroplanes to fall out of the sky. There were also less dramatic stories such as an episode that centred around the medical dangers of jet lag. After Davis and Pedler left the series at the conclusion of the second series in 1971, the series turned into a more conventional thriller drama. The two creators openly criticised this change.

The first two series each consisted of thirteen episodes, and the third of twelve, of which one, titled &quot;Sex and Violence&quot;, was not transmitted. It has been suggested that this was because of objections to either its use of stock news footage of a public execution in Lagos, or its presentation of characters designed to be satirical analogues of Mary Whitehouse, Cliff Richard and Lord Longford. The execution footage has appeared on British television a number of times since 1972, notably in a 1988 edition of &quot;Panorama&quot; about violence on television.

&quot;Doomwatch&quot; was popular, and at its peak drew audiences of as high as 13.6 million for the episode &quot;Invasion&quot;, filmed mostly in the village of Grassington in North Yorkshire. The start of every series merited a cover feature on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Radio Times&quot; listings magazine, which even today is a prestigious feat for a programme. The series was also sold abroad, gaining some popularity when transmitted in Canada.

==Archive loss after production==
As was common at the time, the BBC wiped the &quot;Doomwatch&quot; master tapes soon after transmission, regarding them as being of little further use. Although some episodes have been returned from Canada or exist as telerecordings, many are still missing and will probably remain so, although all are being sought by the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt as a whole. However, a copy of the un-broadcast episode survives in the archives, one of only three from the final series to do so. Series two is complete, thanks to the returns from Canada, but series one is missing five episodes. All of the existing episodes, other than &quot;Sex and Violence&quot;, were repeated on the satellite channel UK Gold during the 1990s, although that episode was erroneously published in broadcast schedules.

==Cast and crew==
The main character throughout the series was Nobel Prize winner, Dr Spencer Quist, who had been given the task of setting up and running the department by the British government. Quist is haunted by guilt through having worked on the Manhattan Project, making the first nuclear bomb. He was played throughout the BBC run by John Paul, a familiar face from a range of British television series, who later went on to appear in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.

The other main regular character throughout the run was Dr John Ridge, played by Simon Oates. He often did not see eye to eye with Quist, whom he called a &quot;bastard&quot; in episode 7 for manipulating one of his own staff into lying to Ridge on the telephone that their secretary, Pat Hunnisett, had died. Dr Ridge appeared in only four episodes of the final season. One of the first series&#x27; main characters was Tobias &#x27;Toby&#x27; Wren (Robert Powell), who provided one of &quot;Doomwatch&quot;″s most memorable episodes when he was dramatically killed off in an explosion at the conclusion of the series one finale, &quot;Survival Code&quot;. Powell had only signed for one series; the producers wanted him to sign for a second run, but he was adamant that he wanted to leave the series on a high, and suggested that they get rid of him by blowing him up, which they did. The BBC got more letters on his unexpected death in the series than any other subject since the Second World War.

Wren was trying to disarm a nuclear device, which had been traced to a pavilion at the end of a seaside pier at Byfield Regis. Having thought he was finished, a pair of wire cutters slips from Wren&#x27;s hands and falls into the sea just before he discovers a last wire as the remaining seconds tick away. Though the nuclear part of the bomb is safe, we see the pavilion explode as the conventional explosive goes off, killing Wren and two others. Though this episode is missing, the scene is shown at the start of the first episode of series two in which there are recriminations, guilt and an official enquiry, which is intended to get rid of Quist.

Wren was played by Robert Powell, who later found worldwide fame as the title character in the television series &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, and starred in films such as the 1978 version of &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; and later the BBC medical series &quot;Holby City&quot; in the 2000s and 2010s. The ministerial antagonist to the Doomwatch team, determined to keep the department following the government line, was played by John Barron, better known as &#x27;CJ&#x27; from the comedy series &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;. Other members of the cast were: Philip Bond as Inspector Drew, Joby Blanshard as Colin Bradley, Wendy Hall as Pat Hunnisett, Vivien Sherrard as Barbara Mason, John Nolan as Geoff Hardcastle, John Bown as Commander Neil Stafford, Jean Trend as Dr. Fay Chantry, Elizabeth Weaver as Dr Anne Tarrant, and Moultrie Kelsall as Drummond.

Throughout its run, &quot;Doomwatch&quot; was produced by Terence Dudley, who also contributed several scripts himself. Dudley went on to produce another well-remembered BBC science-fiction drama, &quot;Survivors&quot;, and in the early 1980s wrote and directed episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Aside from Davis, Pedler and Dudley, several other writers wrote episodes for the programme, including well-known veterans of several other British television science-fiction productions such as Robert Holmes, Dennis Spooner and Louis Marks.

==Spin-off film==
The &quot;Doomwatch&quot; feature film was produced by Tigon British Film Productions Ltd under licence from the BBC, and released in 1972. The script was based on a screenplay by Clive Exton from a story by Davis and Pedler. The television series&#x27; main characters appeared, played by their original actors, but main billing was given Ian Bannen and Judy Geeson as new characters. The film also featured George Sanders.

==Revival==
In 1999, Channel 5 bought the rights to revive &quot;Doomwatch&quot; from the BBC, and on 7 December that year screened a 100-minute TV movie produced by the independent production company Working Title Television. Subtitled &quot;Winter Angel&quot;, the television movie was a continuation of the story rather than a remake.

Written by John Howlett and Ian McDonald, only one of the original characters from the series appears, an aged Dr Spencer Quist—now played by actor Philip Stone, as John Paul had died in 1995. Quist is killed off during the course of the TV movie, and the main character was Neil Tannahill, played by Trevor Eve, who at the conclusion of the story sets up a new Doomwatch group to pursue the same aims as that of the original series. In the film, an artificial black hole is created as an energy source. The downside of this was, once created, it must be forever looked after or it could explode with force enough to destroy a country.

Although Channel 5 had intended the production to act as the pilot for a possible series and it had been generally well received by critics and public, further episodes were not forthcoming. This was generally accepted to be for reasons of cost.

==VHS and DVD releases==
BBC Enterprises released two separate VHS tapes in March 1991, the first containing &quot;The Plastic Eaters&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow, the Rat&quot;, and the second &quot;The Red Sky&quot; and &quot;You Killed Toby Wren&quot;. Paradox Films re-issued the tape of &quot;The Plastic Eaters&quot;/&quot;Tomorrow, the Rat&quot; in June 1995, with a different cover, and subsequently released the same episodes on DVD in January 2001.

In April 2016, Simply Media released a seven-disc DVD box set containing all 24 surviving episodes of &quot;Doomwatch&quot;, including &quot;Sex and Violence&quot;, which remains unbroadcast. The DVD box set also contains the BBC documentary &quot;The Cult of Doomwatch&quot;, originally broadcast on BBC Four on 21 November 2006.

==Books==
Pedler and Davis reused the plot of the first episode of the series, &quot;The Plastic Eaters&quot;, for their 1971 novel &quot;Mutant 59: The Plastic Eater&quot;, This was not technically a &quot;Doomwatch&quot; novel, however, and did not contain the characters from the series. The book also re-used the &quot;Radio Times&quot; cover photograph of a melted plastic aeroplane in a briefcase.

In 1975, Longman Education published &quot;Doomwatch - The World in Danger&quot;, a simplified adaptation of the episodes &quot;The Plastic Eaters&quot;, &quot;The Red Sky&quot; and &quot;Survival Code&quot;.

In 2012, Miwk Publishing released &quot;Deadly Dangerous Tomorrow&quot;, a collection of scripts of six of the missing episodes: &quot;Spectre at the Feast&quot;, &quot;Fire and Brimstone&quot;, &quot;High Mountain&quot;, &quot;Say Knife, Fat Man&quot;, &quot;Deadly Dangerous Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Flood&quot;.

==Episodes==
38 episodes of &quot;Doomwatch&quot; were recorded, 37 of which were broadcast on BBC1 on Monday nights from February 1970 to August 1972. 14 episodes are missing from the television archives, mainly from series three. 23 of the transmitted episodes of &quot;Doomwatch&quot; are known to survive; the untransmitted &quot;Sex and Violence&quot; also survives and has still never been broadcast on British television, although it is included on the 2016 DVD box set release.

<doc id="858519" wikidata="Q1247515" url="?curid=858519" title="Martial arts manual">
<text>Martial arts manuals are instructions, with or without illustrations, specifically designed to be learnt from a book. Many books detailing specific techniques of martial arts are often erroneously called manuals but were written as treatises.

Prose descriptions of martial arts techniques appear late within the history of literature, due to the inherent difficulties of describing a technique rather than just demonstrating it.

The earliest extant manuscript on armed combat (as opposed to unarmed wrestling) is Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (&quot;I.33&quot;), written in Franconia around 1300.

Not within the scope of this article are books on military strategy such as Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; (before 100 BCE) or Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus&#x27; &quot;De Re Militari&quot; (4th century), or military technology, such as &quot;De rebus bellicis&quot; (4th to 5th century).

==Predecessors==

Some early testimonies of historical martial arts consist of series of images only. The earliest example is a fresco in tomb 15 at Beni Hasan, showing illustrations of wrestling techniques dating to the 20th century BCE. Similar depictions of wrestling techniques are found on Attic vases dating to Classical Greece.

The only known instance of a book from classical antiquity is Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 466 from the 2nd century CE, detailing Greek wrestling techniques. 

There are some examples in the Chinese classics that may predate the turn of the Common Era: the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by Sima Qian (c. 100 BCE) documents wrestling, referring to earlier how-to manuals of the Western Han (2nd century BCE), which have however not survived. An extant Chinese text on wrestling is &quot;Six Chapters of Hand Fighting&quot; included in the 1st-century CE &quot;Book of Han&quot;.

All other extant manuals date to the Middle Ages or later. 

The &quot;combat stele&quot; at the Shaolin Monastery dates to 728 CE.

The earliest text detailing Indian martial arts is the &quot;Agni Purana&quot; (c. 8th century), which contains several chapters giving descriptions and instructions on fighting techniques. It described how to improve a warrior&#x27;s individual prowess and kill enemies using various methods in warfare whether they went to war in chariots, horses, elephants or on foot. Foot methods were subdivided into armed combat and unarmed combat. The former included the bow and arrow, the sword, spear, noose, armour, iron dart, club, battle axe, chakram and trident. The latter included wrestling, knee strikes, punching and kicking methods.

The oldest extant European martial arts manual is Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (c. 1300).

&quot;Illustrations only&quot; manuals do not become extinct with the appearance of prose instructions, but rather exist alongside these, e.g. in the form of the Late Medieval German illuminated manuscripts.

==Historical European martial arts==
===German Fechtbücher===

&#x27; (plural &#x27;) is Early New High German for &#x27;combat manual&#x27;, one of the manuscripts or printed books of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance containing descriptions of a martial art. The term is usually taken to include 15th- and 16th-century German manuals, but the nature of the subject matter does not allow a clear separation of these from treatises from other parts of Europe on one hand (particularly from the Italian and French schools), and from manuals of later centuries on the other hand.

Notable include: 
*Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (&quot;Walpurgis Manuscript&quot;) (c. 1300, predating Johannes Liechtenauer)
*Nürnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a (c. 1389)
*Fechtbuch of Sigmund Ringeck (1440s)
*Codex Vindobonensis B 11093, kept in Vienna, and &quot;Gladiatoria&quot;, discovered in Poland, both dating to the mid-15th century and largely uninfluenced by Liechtenauer.
* of Hans Talhoffer (several surviving manuscripts dating from 1443–1467).
* of Peter von Danzig, Cod. 44 A 8, 1452
*Jud Lew Cod.I.6.4°.3 (1450s), Augsburg
* of Paulus Kal (1460s)
*Cgm 558, a Swiss treatise of the later 15th century only loosely related to the German school.

===Italian treatises===
The Italian school is attested in an early manual of 1410, at which time it is not yet clearly separable from the German school. Indeed, the author Fiore dei Liberi states that he has learned much of his art from one &quot;Master Johannes of Swabia&quot;. The heyday of the Italian school comes in the 16th century, with the Dardi school.

*Fiore dei Liberi&#x27;s &quot;Flos Duellatorum&quot; (1410)
*Filippo Vadi&#x27;s &quot;De Arte Gladiatoria Dimicandi&quot; (1485)
*Pietro Monte (1509)

*Salvator Fabris (1606)
*Ridolfo Capo Ferro (1610)
*Francesco Alfieri, &quot;La Scherma&quot; (1640)
*Giuseppe Colombani (1711)

===French manuals===
Similar to the situation in Italy, there is one early manual (c. 1400, dealing with the pollaxe exclusively), and later treatises appear only after a gap of more than a century.

*&quot;Le jeu de la hache&quot; (c. 1400)
*Andre Pauernfeindt, (1528)—This is a French translation of Pauernfeindt&#x27;s 1516 work. One notable difference between it and the original is that the &quot;noble science&quot; print has colored images, unlike the German.
*Henry de Sainct-Didier, (1573)
*Gérard Thibault d&#x27;Anvers, (1623)
*Monsieur L&#x27;Abbat, &quot;The Art of Fencing, or, the Use of the Small Sword&quot; (1734)

===British manuals===

==== England ====
Apart from three rather opaque texts of the later 15th century, the native English tradition of fencing manuals begins with George Silver&#x27;s &quot;Paradoxes of Defense&quot; (1599).

*Harley MS 3542 (&quot;The Man Who Wol&quot;), late 14th–early 15th century
*Cotton Titus, 15th-century English greatsword and staff
*Additional Manuscript 39564, 15th century
*George Silver, &quot;Paradoxes of Defense&quot; (1599)
*Joseph Swetnam, &quot;Schoole of the Noble and Worthy Science of Defence&quot; (1612)
*Captain John Godfrey, &quot;A Treatise Upon the Useful Science of Defence, Connecting the Small and Back-Sword&quot; (1747)
*John Musgrave Waite, &quot;Lessons in sabre, singlestick, sabre &amp; bayonet, and sword feats&quot; (1880)
*Alfred Hutton, &quot;Cold Steel, A Practical Treatise on the Sabre&quot; (1889), &quot;Old Sword-Play&quot; (1892)

==== Scotland ====

Scottish manuals detailing the use of the basket-hilted Scottish broadsword, besides other disciplines such as the smallsword and spadroon, were published throughout the 18th century, with early and late examples dating to the late 17th and early 19th centuries, respectively:

* Sir William Hope, &quot;The Scots Fencing Master (the Complete Smallswordsman)&quot; (1687)
* Sir William Hope, &quot;Advice to his Scholar from the Fencing Master&quot; (1692)
* Sir William Hope, &quot;Complete Fencing Master&quot; (1691–1692)
* Sir William Hope, &quot;The Swordsman&#x27;s Vade-Mecum&quot; (1692)
* Sir William Hope, &quot;New Short and Easy Method of Fencing&quot; (1st edition, 1707)
* Sir William Hope, &quot;New Short and Easy Method of Fencing&quot; (2nd edition, 1714)
* Sir William Hope, &quot;A Few Observations upon the Fighting for Prizes in the Bear Gardens&quot; (1715)
* Sir William Hope, &quot;A Vindication of the True Art of Self-Defence&quot; (1724)
* Donald McBane, &quot;Expert Swords-man&#x27;s Companion&quot; (1728)
* Captain James Miller, &quot;A treatise on backsword, sword, buckler, sword and dagger, sword and great gauntlet, falchon, quarterstaff&quot; (1737)
* Thomas Page, &quot;The Use of the Broad Sword&quot; (1746)
* Captain G. Sinclair, &quot;Anti-Pugilism – Anonymous&quot; (1790)
* Captain G. Sinclair, &quot;Cudgel Playing Modernized and Improved; or, The Science of Defence, Exemplified in a Few Short and Easy Lessons, for the Practice of the Broad Sword or Single Stick, on Foot&quot;
* Archibald MacGregor, &quot;Lecture on the Art of Defence&quot; (1791)
* Thomas Rowlandson, &quot;The Guards of the Highland Broadsword&quot; (1799)
* Henry Angelo and son, &quot;Hungarian &amp; Highland Broadsword&quot; (1799)
* John Taylor, &quot;The Art of Defence on Foot with Broadsword and Saber&quot; (1804)
* Thomas Mathewson, &quot;Fencing Familiarized; or, a New Treatise on the Art of the Scotch Broad Sword&quot; (1805)

===Iberian manuals===
There are some manuals containing training advice for the medieval tournament and jousting, such as the early Portuguese work &quot;A ensinança de bem cavalgar em toda a sela&quot; by Edward of Portugal (1391–1438), a riding instruction manual that also included martial information.

In 1599, the swordmaster Domingo Luis Godinho wrote the &quot;Arte de Esgrima&quot;, the only fencing manual that preserved the older &quot;Common&quot; or &quot;Vulgar&quot; system of Spanish fencing, which has its traditions in the Middle Ages.

17th-century Spanish destreza is steeped in the Spanish Baroque noblemen mindset, so it does not contain graphical explanations of the fencing techniques so much as explanations based on mathematics and philosophical sciences in general. The subsequent difficulty in interpreting the theory and practice of correctly has frequently led to this school of fencing being misunderstood.

==Historical Asian martial arts==
Some texts on unarmed combat survive from Han China (c. 1st century). A list of wrestling techniques is contained in the &quot;Malla Purana&quot; of 13th-century Gujarat, India. The Chinese &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot; dates to the 1560s. The Korean &quot;Muyejebo&quot; dates to 1598, the &quot;Muyedobotongji&quot; dates to 1790. The Japanese &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; dates to 1645.

<doc id="858524" wikidata="Q3146519" url="?curid=858524" title="IBM System/4 Pi">
<text>The IBM System/4 Pi is a family of avionics computers used, in various versions, on the F-15 Eagle fighter, E-3 Sentry AWACS, Harpoon Missile, NASA&#x27;s Skylab, MOL, and the Space Shuttle, as well as other aircraft. Development began in 1965, deliveries in 1967. They were developed by the IBM Federal Systems Division and produced by the Electronics Systems Center in Owego, NY.

It descends from the approach used in the System/360 mainframe family of computers, in which the members of the family were intended for use in many varied user applications. (This is expressed in the name: there are 4π steradians in a sphere, just as there are 360 degrees in a circle.) Previously, custom computers had been designed for each aerospace application, which was extremely costly.

== Early models ==
In 1967, the System/4 Pi family consisted of these basic models:

* Model TC (Tactical Computer) - A briefcase-size computer for applications such as missile guidance, helicopters, satellites and submarines.
* Model CP (Customized Processor/Cost Performance) - An intermediate-range processor for applications such as aircraft navigation, weapons delivery, radar correlation and mobile battlefield systems.
** Model CP-2 (Cost Performance - Model 2)
* Model EP (Extended Performance) - A large-scale data processor for applications requiring real-time processing of large volumes of data, such as crewed spacecraft, airborne warning and control systems and command and control systems. Model EP used an instruction subset of IBM System/360 (Model 44) - user programs could be checked on System/360

The Skylab space station employed the model TC-1, which had a 16-bit word length and 16,384 words of memory with a custom input/output assembly. Skylab had two, redundant, TC-1 computers: a prime (energized) and a backup (non energized.) There would be an automatic switchover (taking on the order of one second) to the backup in the event of a critical failure of the prime. A total of twelve were delivered to NASA by 1972. Two were flown on Skylab in 1973-1974; the others were used for testing and mission simulators. The software management effort was led by Harlan Mills and Fred Brooks. The Skylab flight software development process incorporated many lessons learned during the IBM System/360 Operating System project, as described in Brooks&#x27; 1975 book &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;.

==Advanced Processor==
The AP-101, being the top-of-the-line of the System/4 Pi range, shares its general architecture with the System/360 mainframes. It is a repackaged version of the IBM Advanced Processor-1 (AP-1) used in the F-15 fighter. The AP-1 prototypes were delivered in 1971 and the AP-101 in 1973. It has 16 32-bit registers. Originally only 16 bits were available for addressing memory; later this was extended with four bits from the program status word register, allowing a directly addressable memory range of 1M locations. This avionics computer has been used in the U.S. Space Shuttle, the B-52 and B-1B bombers, and other aircraft. It remained in service on the Space Shuttle because it worked, was flight-certified, and developing a new system would have been too expensive.

There were a number of variants of the AP101. The Offensive Avionics System, a retrofit update of the B-52, contains two AP-101C computers. The AP-101C prototypes were delivered in 1978. The B-1B employs a network of eight model AP-101F computers. The Space Shuttle used two variants of the AP-101: the earlier AP-101B and the upgraded AP-101S. The AP-101B was used for a series of Approach and Landing Tests in 1977. The first ascent to orbit was in 1981. The AP-101S first launched in 2000.

 Each AP-101 on the Shuttle was coupled with an input-output processor (IOP), consisting of one Master Sequence Controller (MSC) and 24 Bus Control Elements (BCEs). The MSC and BCEs executed programs from the same memory system as the main CPU, offloading control of the Shuttle&#x27;s serial data bus system from the CPU. The AP-101B originally used in the Space Shuttle had magnetic-core memory. The upgrade to the AP-101S in the early 1990s replaced the core with semiconductor memory and reduced the size from two to one chassis. It was augmented by glass cockpit technology. Both variants use a microprogram to define the instruction set architecture. The early AP-101 variants used IBM&#x27;S Multipurpose Midline Processor (MMP) architecture. The AP-101B microprogram implemented MMP with 154 instructions. The AP101S could operate with a backwards compatible MMP with 158 instructions or the MIL-STD-1750A architecture with 243 instructions. It was based on the AP-101F used in the B-1B. The AP-101S/G was an interim processor. The AP-101B performance was 0.420 MIPS, while the AP-101S was 1.27 MIPS. James E. Tomayko, who was contracted by NASA to write a history of computers in spaceflight, has said: 

The Space Shuttle used five AP-101 computers as &quot;General-Purpose Computers&quot; (GPCs). Four operated in sync, for redundancy, while the fifth was a backup running software written independently. The Shuttle&#x27;s guidance, navigation and control software was written in HAL/S, a special-purpose high-level programming language, while much of the operating system and low-level utility software was written in assembly language. AP-101s used by the US Air Force are mostly programmed in JOVIAL, such as the system found on the B-1B bomber.

The AP-102 variant design began in 1984. It is a MIL-STD-1750A standard instruction set architecture. It was first used in the F-117A Nighthawk. It was upgraded to the AP-102A in the early 1990s.

<doc id="858525" wikidata="Q941446" url="?curid=858525" title="German school of fencing">
<text>The German school of fencing (&#x27;) is a system of combat taught in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval]], [[German Renaissance]], and [[early modern]] periods. It is described in the contemporary [[Fechtbuch|Fechtbücher]] (&quot;fencing books&quot;) written at the time. The geographical center of this tradition was in what is now [[Southern Germany]] including [[Augsburg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]]. During the period in which it was taught, it was known as the&#x27;, or the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;. The German school of fencing focuses primarily on the use of the two-handed longsword; it also describes the use of many other weapons, including polearms, medieval daggers, messers (with or without a buckler), and the staff, as well as describing mounted combat and unarmed grappling (&quot;ringen&quot;).

Most authors of writings on the system are, or claim to be, in the tradition of the 14th-century master Johannes Liechtenauer. The earliest surviving treatise on Liechtenauer&#x27;s system is a manuscript dated to possibly the late 14th, or early 15th century, known as Ms. 3227a. More manuscripts survive from the 15th century, and during the 16th century the system was also presented in print, most notably by Joachim Meyer in 1570.

The German tradition was largely eclipsed by the Italian school of rapier fencing by the early 17th century. Practitioners of the German school persisted at least until the end of the 18th century, though.

Fencing with the German longsword has been a focus of historical European martial arts reconstruction since the late 19th century, when swordsmen such as Alfred Hutton first popularized the pursuit.

==History==

===Late medieval tradition===
The first document of German heritage which shows fencing techniques is the &quot;Royal Armouries Ms. I.33&quot;, which was written around 1300. The next documents date from approximately a century later, when records of the tradition attributed to the 14th-century master Johannes Liechtenauer begin to appear.

The history of the German school of fencing in the tradition of Liechtenauer spans roughly 250 years, or 8–10 generations of masters (depending on the dating of Liechtenauer) from 1350 to 1600. The earliest source, Ms. 3227a of 1389, mentions a number of masters who are considered peers of Liechtenauer: Hanko Döbringer, Andres Jud, Jost von der Nyssen, and Niklaus Preuss. Martin Hundsfeld and Ott Jud were probably active in the early 15th century, but there is a scarcity of historical sources until the mid-15th century.

The mid-15th century saw the peak and decline of the &quot;Society of Liechtenauer&quot; under Peter von Danzig, Sigmund Ringeck, and Paulus Kal. Kal&#x27;s contemporary, Hans Talhoffer, may have been involved with the founding of the Brotherhood of St. Mark, which enjoyed a quasi-monopoly on teaching martial arts from 1487 until 1570.

In 1514, Emperor Maximilian L. gave special privileges to both the Marksbrüder and much later to the Federfechter, and propagated the fencing style of Liechtenauer in the entire Holy Roman Empire (it became de facto the dominant martial arts within the Holy Roman Empire, despite the fact that there were other martial art schools active in the Empire at the time). The Emperor also granted students the right to bear arms and allowed them to have duels.

===German Renaissance===
Late 15th-century masters include Johannes Lecküchner, Hans von Speyer, Peter Falkner, and Hans Folz. In the 16th century, the tradition became more a sporting exercise than a system of combat for duelling or the battlefield. Early 16th-century masters include Hans Wurm, Jörg Wilhalm, and Andre Pauernfeindt (also &quot;Paurnfeindt; Paurnfeyndt; Paurenfeyndt&quot;).

In 1516, Pauernfeindt published a treatise entitled &quot;Ergründung der ritterlichen kunst des fechtens durch freyfechter czu Vienn&quot; (&quot;Foundation of the knightly art of combat by the Freifechter of Vienna&quot;), which is one of the earliest printed fencing manuals. Comparisons with descriptions in other manuscripts from the period (such as the Cologne Fechtbuch) confirm that this period was a transitional stage between the late medieval school of Johannes Liechtenauer and the German Renaissance &quot;sportive&quot; Federfechten as practiced in the late 16th century (as recorded in the later printed manuals by Joachim Meyer and others). A later manuscript, dated 1564 and attributed to Lienhart Sollinger, cites Pauernfeindt and is largely identical in content.

In the mid 16th century, the first attempts, notably by Paulus Hector Mair, at preserving and reconstructing the teachings of the past century appeared. The foundation of the &quot;Federfechter&quot; in 1570 at Vienna falls into this late period. The final phase of the tradition stretches from the late 16th to the early 17th century, with masters such as Joachim Meyer and Jakob Sutor.

===Decline of the German tradition===
In the 17th century, rapier fencing of the Italian school became fashionable due to treatises by such as Salvator Fabris, and the German tradition becoming regarded as old-fashioned and unrefined among the nobility during the Baroque. Longsword fencing was gradually discontinued at noble fencing schools, including most universities, at the time. The rapier had an advantage in that it could be worn well with the clothing of that time period when longswords were typically seen as too large to be worn fashionably. Thirty Years&#x27; War also led to a massive decline of both fencing schools and practitioners in the Holy Roman Empire. Both Peter Hagendorf (a mercenary who fought in the Thirty Years&#x27; War) and Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen make references in their works to the excessive number of deaths among the member of the traditional fencing guilds and the massive destruction of the regions in which they were active (this also explains why most of the surviving schools and lines were active in the eastern part of the Holy Roman Empire or in regions that were far less affected by the war).

Author Jean Daniel L&#x27;Ange writes in his book &quot;Deutliche und gründliche Erklärung der adelichen und ritterlichen freyen Fecht-Kunst&quot;, from 1664 (another edition was published in 1708), that &quot;a big sword is very dangerous in our times because it is more difficult to [carry] around with clothing than a smaller thrusting sword, which can easily be worn.&quot; He also writes that &quot;it is possible to kill a man who is armed with a gun in a short range, when he stands close to you[,] with the help of the rapier, because of the highly effective thrusting techniques [that] will save your life, rather than with the slower cutting of a bigger sword or a sabre. You may even be able to kill him, before he can take his gun out of its halter, before he can make the first shot&quot;.

L&#x27;Ange also writes, &quot;you can hide your rapier well under your mantle and thus avoid any provocation in public. A long sword may cause problems and excite enemies&quot;. But L&#x27;Ange also pays tribute to the Marksbrüder and states, &quot;their art is truly a knightly science, it must be preserved for the coming, yet unborn generations!&quot;. However, some civilian fencers still practiced the German school instead of the rapier-fencing of the noble elite. The last known practitioner by name was Theodori Verolini in 1679, when he published his book &quot;Der Kůnstliche Fechter&quot; (&quot;The Artful Fencer&quot;), which was based upon Joachim Meyers fechtbuch.

===Late survivals in the modern period===
There are paintings from the middle of the 18th century that show practitioners still using long swords in the fencing schools of the Marxbrüder and Federfechter. It cannot be verified if these depictions are anachronistic or they show techniques and practices of the original Liechtenauer tradition still in use, although it is highly likely that most 18th century fencers were not at all familiar with longsword fencing and would likely not have known how to handle these weapons, which indicates that these pictures show lines of the Liechtenauer tradition that are referred in literature (and did continue to exist at least until the end of the 18th century / the early 19th century).

In 1726, Gottfried Rudolf Pommer auf Bugenhagen mentions, in his publication &quot;Sammlung von Merktwurdigkeiten&quot; (&quot;Collection of Oddities&quot;), the use of long swords in those fencing schools. Most fencers of the 18th century viewed longsword fencing as a curious thing, and it was probably only taught in the few remaining fencing schools of the Marxbrüder and Federfechter and in some stage fencing schools. There is an illustration of a fencing school from 1726, where *Fechtfedern* (two-handed training swords) are being used and Huten of Liechtenauer&#x27;s school of fencing are recognizable. This portrayal is compatible with the contemporary sources which refer to longsword fencing in the existing fencing schools of the 18th century in the Holy Roman Empire. Author and historian Joseph Ott notices that the longsword survived the rapier in the fencing schools of the Marksbrüder in the 18th century. The rapier was replaced by the smaller smallsword during the late 17th century and the foil became a fashionable training weapon in the 18th century, however both fencing with the longsword and the Dusack was till being taught in the fencing schools of the Marksbrüder.

German historian Johann Büsching mentioned the existence of both the Brotherhood of St. Mark and the Federfechter as well as the existence of &quot;Klopffechter&quot; (artistic and stage fencers who used blunt weapons) as late as 1735. He further stated that there were alive in 1817 at least a handful of skilled people who knew how to use &quot;battle swords&quot; (&quot;Schlachtschwerter&quot;, another name for either longswords or Zweihänder). Büsching goes on to say that the art was dying out very slowly, mostly due to the fact that there were fewer living fencers who were trained by the few remaining Marxbrüder und Federfechter.

The last of public displays of longsword fencing was on 5 November 1741, the author clearly mentions the use of &quot;Schlachtenschwerter&quot; (&quot;battle swords&quot;). The most prominent guest of one of the last of these displays was the young Francis I., holy Roman Emperor who enjoyed the presentation very much. Strangely enough, the public demonstrations of these fencing styles seem to end very abruptly, despite the big popularity they had among both noblemen and common citizens.

Some historians assume that it was the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire which directly led to the end and eventual extinction of its unique fencing culture, because the downfall of the Empire did also destroy much of its oldest institutions and practices.

The collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, in 1806, and the wars and battles of the period destroyed several of the remaining old fencing schools and led to the death of many active fencers. It is possible that the Napoleonic wars brought an end to most of the remaining lines of the Liechtenauer tradition.

Another source mentions living longsword fencers who were alive in 1819, but who were &quot;without any fencing schools&quot; (a reference to the decline of both the Federfechter and the Marksbrüder).

The German historian Alfred Schaer presented evidence that longsword fencing was referenced in descriptions and even portrayed on images of the Marksbrüder and the Federfechter as long as these institutions existed. He makes the argument that longsword fencing was such an integral part of the tradition of these imperial institutions that they stubbornly clinged to it, even centuries after longsword fencing had lost its relevancy for battles or judicial duels.

The last practitioners of longsword fencing may have ceased activity with the dissolution of the Marxbrüder and Federfechter by the early 19th century.

On 16 April 1862, The Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung mentioned the death of an unnamed, 76-year-old (born in 1786) former member of the Marksbrüder, who having fenced longsword in his teenage years in the early 1800s, was possibly the last living practitioner.

The last known source who mentions living members of the Marksbrüder is the &quot;Jagd-Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Hunting Newspapers&quot;) part 9 from 1866. The author Jos Baader, mentions living veterans of the old fencing schools who were still alive but very old (he mentions a gentleman who is in his late 80s, but was once a practitioner of their specific longsword fencing style).

There were some living German longsword fencers alive during the lifetime of Alfred Hutton, a British fencer of the 19th century who was interested into the reconstruction of old fencing systems. Hutton could have met some living longsword fencers and interviewed them. He could have preserved at least a part of their knowledge, if he had been to Germany and met the last living Marksbrüder members.

Some aspects and basics—such as the Huten, the basic four guards of the Liechtenauer traditions, and some terminology (terms such as &quot;Schrankhut&quot; and &quot;Langort&quot; can still be found in rare German stage fencing literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries), as well as the four basic cuts and the thrusts from all guards of medieval German longsword fencing—survived in some classic German stage fencing schools (&quot;Bühnenfechtkunst&quot;) at least until the middle of the 20th century.

The close relationship between longsword fencers of the Liechtenauer tradition and stage fencers can be traced back at least until the medieval period.

During the time of the Third Reich, there was an interest among certain members of the NSDAP to conserve classical German stage fencing and to teach specifically longsword fencing techniques to young boys who were in the Hitlerjugend, under the name &quot;Ritterspiele&quot; (&quot;Knightly Games&quot;).

Wilhelm Fabricius (1894–1989), a silviculture scientist and passionate admirer of historical martial arts and fencing even wanted to reconstruct German medieval fencing on the basis of traditional stage fencing and the Fechtbuch of Joachim Meyer. Fabricius was later captured by American troops, it is unclear whether or not he continued his reconstruction efforts after the war, although there is evidence that his interest in the subject never faded. The last references and active lines of these techniques in classical German stage fencing vanished almost entirely with the second world war.

After the war, Germans started to vastly prefer modern American stage fencing (which was a mix between 19th century saber fencing and some East Asian martial arts techniques), probably due to the popularity of Hollywood movies in Germany after the second world war. Classical German stage fencing became more and more rare and its practitioners started to die out. As of 2018, almost all of the practitioners of this classical style of stage fencing either have died or would be very old.

Today, the only surviving part of the medieval German school of fencing can be found in modern German Academic fencing, where some of the old terminologies (for example: swords are divided into parts called &quot;Stärke&quot; and &quot;Schwäche&quot;, the term &quot;Anhauen&quot; and the saying &quot;in die Schranken weisen&quot; are directly descended from the medieval German fencing terminology of the Liechtenauer canon) and traditions (such as the unbroken line of German Fencing masters which reaches back to the medieval period) are still active.

===Influence on modern bayonet fencing===

Bayonets (daggers or short swords which were mounted on the barrels of the muskets) were first introduced in either France or Germany in the 16th century and became commonly used in the 17th century (especially during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Johann Georg Pascha, a passionate fencer, was one of the most popular and prominent bayonet fencing masters of the time (though no bayonet fencing book of his seemingly has survived, his books about shooting however still exist). Pascha himself seemingly based large parts of his own combat system on existing fencing schools (his book about Kampfringen makes direct references to Liechtenauer&#x27;s fencing style). The earliest surviving fencing manual about bayonet fencing is most likely Pierre Francois Giffart &#x27;s &quot;L&#x27; Art Militaire Françoise Pour L&#x27;Infanterie&quot; (1697), while written in French, was from a German author. Giffart directly references &quot;thrusting with a longsword&quot; and compares his own bayonet fencing system with &quot;the handling of a large sword&quot; (&quot; épée-grande&quot;).

The 17th century military expert Johann Jacob von Wallhausen describes that longsword fencing was in large parts used as a basis for both fencing with the pike as well as bayonet fencing and the soldier and experienced shootist D.M.B.G.L compares close combat with the bayonet directly with halfsword techniques from Liechtenauer&#x27;s tradition. German schools of bayonet fencing later became more prominent throughout Europe and even influenced both French as well as Anglo-Saxon bayonet fencing systems. Julius Friedrich, Duke of Württemberg argues that German bayonet fencing has its roots both in &quot;wrestling as well as the traditional fencing school&quot; (he most likely references Liechtenauer&#x27;s school of fencing, which was considered to be the indigenous school of fencing of Germany at the time).

Despite the German fencing school&#x27;s decline since the 16th century, its basics, techniques, movements and tactics remained powerful and influential in bayonet fencing as well as pike and polearm combat and was spread slowly across many different European countries. The Hews &quot;Pflug&quot;, &quot;Langort&quot; and &quot;Schlüssel&quot; seem to have been considered the best guards and there were still references to their roots in older, medieval fencing styles as late as the 19th century.

While there were other bayonet fencing systems (some which were based on saber fencing - like in the case of Sir Alfred Hutton&#x27;s bayonet system - or smallsword fencing), there remained an influence of older, pike and longsword-based methods well into the 20th century. William Ewart Fairbairn&#x27;s &quot;All-in Fighting&quot; still makes references to the older bayonet fencing systems and ignores the 19th century systems which used saber-based guards, attacks and parries. Especially noteworthy is the bayonet fencing system of American soldier John Styers, which uses the same basics as Liechtenauer&#x27;s system and - like Fairbairn&#x27;s system - completely ignores the 19th century schools in favor of a more traditional method of bayonet fencing. Like Liechtenauer&#x27;s system, Styers&#x27; method doesn&#x27;t have parries, but uses bladework to focus the enemy weapon away from its original target and provide openings for the fencer to attack. The similarities were so obvious that historian Hortst Ueberhorst referenced them in his publication about physical exercises.

==Spread==
The geographical origin of the tradition of Liechtenauer is difficult to establish. There are several places called &quot;Lichtenau&quot; in Germany, and Ms. 3227a states explicitly that Johannes Liechtenauer traveled widely to learn from as many masters as possible. Of course, it is to be assumed that there were traditions of combat training throughout the medieval world, in spite of the absence of evidence of their details. What is now known as the &quot;German school&quot; comprises those traditions which were put on paper in the late medieval period, and this tradition of compiling written manuals or &quot;epitomes&quot; of fighting systems appears to mostly have been confined to Southern Germany. From about the same time, early records of the Italian school of fencing document the German school, beginning with the writings of Fiore dei Liberi, who mentions a master of Swabia called Johannes &quot;who was a student of Nicholai of Toblem.&quot;

After the medieval period, emerging traditions of fencing, i.e. the early modern rapier systems, as opposed to the generic systems of &quot;combat&quot; or &quot;fighting&quot; of the late medieval period, developed in close contact with each other, which led to the separate but closely related rapier styles of Italy, Spain, and later France, all of which were also well received in Germany. For example: Paulus Hector Mair describes a Spanish style of rapier fencing in his book on fencing.

The 15th century Liechtenauerian tradition seems to have been geographically centered on Swabia and Franconia, and influenced development in the adjacent territories, including Alsace, the Rhineland, the Lowlands, Bohemia, and the Swiss Confederacy. In the 16th century, there was an established tradition of Federfechten competitions. The dominant guild were the Brotherhood of St. Mark which held their annual meeting in Frankfurt. After 1570, there was a second influential guild, the Federfechter, which apparently originated in the southeastern part of the empire (Prague, Vienna). Masters or treatises of the period that can be located geographically include:

*the oldest surviving manual, Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 of c. 1300, originates in Franconia
*the oldest record of the Liechtenauerian tradition, Nürnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a, appears to exhibit East Central German dialectal elements. By 1495, this manuscript had been acquired by Nicolaus Pol of Innsbruck
*Hans Talhoffer, in the 1440s to 1460s, was active throughout Southern Germany, including Königsegg, Emerkingen, and Zürich
*Johannes Lecküchner was active in Nuremberg in the 1460s; Hans Folz also was in Nuremberg in the late 15th to early 16th century. Albrecht Dürer compiled a manual on grappling in c.1505.
*Cgm 558, written in what is now Switzerland, most likely the Toggenburg, shortly before 1500.
*the Cologne Fechtbuch of Cologne or surroundings, c.1510.
*Christian Egenolph of Frankfurt was active in the 1520s 
*Paulus Hector Mair of Augsburg was active in the 1540s. Jörg Wilhalm was also in Augsburg, active during the 1540s to 1560s.
*Joachim Meyer was active in the 1570s in Strasbourg.

Karl Ludwig Blum mentioned that there were traveling masters, who gave lectures to noblemen in the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1505.

In spite of the surging popularity of the Italian and Spanish rapier, elements of the German tradition survived well into the 17th century. Even in 1614, many fencing masters based their fighting styles on the tradition. An example is would-be master Joachim Meyer, who based his early rapier fencing on Lichtenauers principles, which was considered to be the most effective and efficient school of fencing. There is evidence that, in the second half of the 16th century, at least a handful of German long sword fencers (Marksbrüder) traveled to England and gave fencing lessons. Frederic Hervey said that &quot;the Imperial German fencers came to Britain to teach their Anglo-Saxon brethren the old and knightly art of fencing&quot;. However, it can be assumed that few fencers in Britain received such training. One source mentions a &quot;nobleman named Alberth&quot;, from Britain, who was experienced in the German school of longsword fencing, and who was also trained in a Spanish school of swordsmanship, either an early rapier-fencing school of La Verdadera Destreza or a surviving Spanish Medieval school of fencing). Although the German school of fencing was mostly distributed in the Holy Roman Empire, there are hints of practitioners even in Greece, Spain and Scandinavia. The German fencing master Konrad Ditzefeldberg stated in the late 16th century: &quot;the noble art of Liechtenauer may be at home in the (Holy Roman) Empire, but everywhere in Christendom you can find adherents and adepts of the art!&quot;. In 1646, the young prince Louis XIV of France was entertained by longsword fencers at a party (the sources specifically mention the swords as &quot;alte, zweihändige Schlachtenschwerter&quot;, in English: &quot;old, two handed battle swords&quot;). One German source states: &quot;the young prince (Louis XIV) was very excited by the stage fencing provided by fencers from his mother&#x27;s fatherland. When they were finished with the swordplay, he (Louis XIV) clapped loudly and asked for more (stage fights and friendly bouts)&quot; (Note: Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis, was a Spanish princess from the Holy Roman Empire, given that the Liechtenauer tradition was both the most widely practiced and officially recognised form of fencing in the Holy Roman Empire, it is very likely that these fencers were practitioners of the Liechtenauer tradition).

==Disciplines==
Master Johannes Liechtenauer based his system of fencing upon the use of the Longsword. He used this weapon to exemplify several overarching martial principles that also apply to other disciplines within the tradition. &quot;Ringen&quot; (wrestling/grappling) was taught, as well as fighting with the messer, and staff. Also part of the curriculum was fighting with the dagger &quot;Degen&quot; (mainly the roundel dagger) and with polearms. Two other disciplines besides &quot;Blossfechten&quot; involved the sword: fencing with (single-handed) sword and buckler (or a large shield in the case of judicial combat according to Swabian law), and armored fighting (&quot;Harnischfechten&quot;), the latter reserved only for nobility.

==First principles==
Johannes Liechtenauer&#x27;s teachings as recorded in 3227a are introduced by some general principles (foll. 13–17). The anonymous author explicitly states that Liechtenauer had cast his teaching in opaque verses intended to hide their meaning from the uninitiated. He stressed that there is &quot;only a single art of the sword&quot; which had been the same for centuries and which is the kernel and foundation of all arts of combat.

*the principle of taking the shortest and most direct line of attack (&quot;of das aller neheste vnd kors körtzste / slecht vnd gerade czu&quot;) disregarding flourishes or flashy parrying techniques (&quot;mit dem höbschen paryrn vnd weit vmefechten&quot;).
*the difficulty of explaining techniques in words and the importance of direct instruction and intensive training, offering the aphorism that &quot;exercise is better than art, because exercise without art is useful, but art without exercise is useless&quot; (15r).
*the importance of footwork and stance (15v) and of correct distance (&quot;mosse&quot;, 15v) and speed of motion (16r)
*the importance of taking the offensive (&quot;vorslag&quot;, 14v, 16r-16v) with a fixed plan of attack
*the tactical importance of hiding the intended action from the opponent (16r)

The text goes on to present the core principles of successful swordsmanship in eight rhyming couplets (17v):
A characteristic, introductory verse of Liechtenauer&#x27;s – often repeated in later manuscripts – echoes classic 14th century chivalry, addressing the student as &quot;young knight&quot; (&quot;jung ritter&quot;):

:(fol 18r) &quot;Jung Ritter lere / got lip haben frawen io ere / So wechst dein ere / Uebe ritterschaft und lere / kunst dy dich zyret und in krigen sere hofiret&quot;
:&quot;Young knight, learn to love God and revere noble ladies, so that your honour grows. Practice knighthood and learn the art that dignifies you, and brings you honour in wars.&quot;

==Unarmoured longsword==

The principal discipline is unarmoured fencing with the longsword (&quot;Blossfechten&quot;).

The foundation of the system comprises five &quot;master-hews&quot; (&quot;Meisterhäue&quot;) or &quot;hidden hews&quot; from which many masterful techniques arise, 12 &quot;chief pieces&quot; (&quot;hauptstücke&quot;) that categorize the main components of the art, and five words (&quot;fünf Wörter&quot;) dealing with concepts of timing and leverage.

At the center of the art is an emphasis on swiftness, as well as on balance and good judgement:

: (fol. 20r) &quot;vor noch swach stark Indes / an den selben woertern leit alle kunst / meister lichtnawers / Und sint dy gruntfeste und der / kern alles fechtens czu fusse ader czu rosse / blos ader in harnuesche&quot;

:&quot;&#x27;Before&#x27;, &#x27;after&#x27;, &#x27;weak&#x27;, &#x27;strong&#x27;, &quot;Indes&quot; (&#x27;meanwhile&#x27;), on these five words hinges the entire art of master Lichtenauer, and they are the foundation and the core of all combat, on foot or on horseback, unarmoured or armoured.&quot;

The terms &quot;before&quot; (&quot;vor&quot;) and &quot;after&quot; (&quot;nach&quot;) correspond to offensive and defensive actions. While in the &quot;vor&quot;, one dictates his opponent&#x27;s actions and thus is in control of the engagement, while in the &quot;nach&quot;, one responds to the decisions made by his opponent. Under Liechtenauer&#x27;s system, a combatant must always strive to be in control of the engagement—that is, in the &quot;vor&quot;. &quot;Strong&quot; (&quot;stark&quot;) and &quot;weak&quot; (&quot;swach&quot;) relate to the amount of force that is applied in a bind, or contact, of the swords. Here, neither is better than the other, but one needs to counter the opponent&#x27;s action with a complementary reaction; strength is countered with weakness, and weakness with strength. &quot;Indes&quot; means &quot;meanwhile&quot; or &quot;interim&quot;, referring to the time it takes for the opponent to complete an action. At the instant of contact with the opponent&#x27;s blade, an experienced fencer uses &quot;feeling&quot; (&quot;fühlen&quot;) to immediately sense his opponent&#x27;s pressure in order to know whether he should be &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; against him. He then either attacks on the &quot;vor&quot; or remains in the bind until his opponent acts, depending on what he feels is right. When his opponent starts to act, the fencer acts &quot;indes&quot; (meanwhile) and regains the &quot;vor&quot; before the opponent can finish his action.

What follows is a list of technical terms of the system &quot;(with rough translation; they should each be explained in a separate section)&quot;:

===Range===
Some of the later practitioners of the German school of fencing, such as Theodori Verolini, started to use the term &quot;Mensur&quot; (measure) in the 17th century to explain the different ranges of the art of fencing.

*&quot;Weite Mensur&quot; (wide measure) the attacker has to make two footsteps to reach his opponent with his weapon.
*&quot;Mittlere Mensur&quot; (middle measure) the attacker has to make one footstep to reach the other combatant with the blade.
*&quot;Nahe Mensur&quot; (near measure) the attacker can cut or thrust his enemy without having to make any footsteps.
*&quot;Enge Mensur&quot; (close measure) the attacker and his opponent are so close that they are able to reach the other person with their hands. Most of the wrestling-techniques (&quot;Ringen am Schwert&quot;) can only be used in the close measure.

===Basic attacks===
Liechtenauer and other German masters describe three basic methods of attack with the sword. They are sometimes called &quot;drei wunder&quot;, &quot;three wounders&quot;, with a deliberate pun on &quot;three wonders.&quot;

*&quot;Hauen&quot;, &quot;hews&quot;: A hewing stroke with one of the edges of the sword.
**&quot;Oberhau&quot;, &quot;over hew&quot;: A stroke delivered from above the attacker.
**&quot;Mittelhau&quot;, &quot;middle hew&quot;: A stroke delivered from side to side.
**&quot;Unterhau&quot;, &quot;under hew&quot;: A stroke delivered from below the attacker.
*&quot;Stechen&quot;, &quot;stabbing&quot;: A thrusting attack made with the point of the sword.
*&quot;Abschneiden&quot;, &quot;slicing off&quot;: Slicing attacks made with the edge of the sword by placing the edge against the body of the opponent and then pushing or pulling the blade along it.

===Master-Hews (Meisterhäue)===
Called &quot;five hews&quot; in 3227a, later &quot;hidden hews,&quot; and in late manuals &quot;master hews&quot;, these likely originated as secret surprise attacks in Liechtenauer&#x27;s system, but with the success of Liechtenauer&#x27;s school, they may have become common knowledge. All five are attacks from the first phase of the fight (&quot;zufechten&quot;) and are long range, accompanied by triangular stepping.

* &quot;Zornhau&quot;: &quot;wrath-hew&quot;
:A powerful diagonal hewing stroke dealt from the &quot;vom Tag&quot; guard that ends in the Wechsel guard on the opposite side. When a Zornhau is used to displace (&quot;Versetzen&quot;) another oberhau, the impact and binding of the blades will result in the hew ending in a lower hanging at the center of the body. This strike is normally thrown to the opponent&#x27;s upper opening.
* &quot;Krumphau&quot;: &quot;crooked-hew&quot;
:A vertical hew from above that reaches across the direct line to the opponent, traveling left from a right position and vice versa. Krumphau is almost always accompanied with a wide diagonal sideways step. The Krumphau breaks the guard Ochs.
* &quot;Zwerchhau&quot;, or &quot;Twerhau&quot;: &quot;thwart-hew&quot;
:A high horizontal hew, with the short (backhand) edge when thrown from the right side and with the long edge when thrown from the left side. The Zwerchau breaks the guard vom Tag.
* &quot;Schielhau&quot;: &quot;squinting-hew&quot;
:A short edge (backhand) hew dealt from the &quot;vom Tag&quot; guard that ends in an upper hanger on the opposite side and usually targets the head or the right shoulder. It is basically a twist from &quot;vom Tag&quot; to opposite side &quot;Ochs&quot; with one step forward, striking simultaneously &quot;downwards&quot; with the short edge. The Schielhau breaks both the Pflug and Langen Ort guards and can be used to counter-hew against a powerful Oberhau.
* &quot;Scheitelhau&quot;: &quot;part-hew&quot;
:A vertical descending hew that ends in the guard Alber. This hew is dealt to the opponent&#x27;s upper openings, most often to the opponent&#x27;s head, where the hair parts (hence the name of the hew). Through the principle of überlauffen, &quot;overrunning&quot; or &quot;overreaching&quot;, a Scheitelhau is used to break the guard Alber.

===Guards (also known as huten or leger)===
Basic Guards
*&quot;vom Tach&quot;: &quot;from the Roof&quot;
:a basic position with the sword held either on the right shoulder or above the head. The blade can be held vertically or at roughly 45-degrees. The word &quot;tach&quot;, or &quot;dach&quot;, is often translated as &quot;roof&quot;.
*&quot;Ochs&quot;: &quot;ox&quot;
:a position with the sword held to either side of the head, with the point (as a horn) aiming at the opponent&#x27;s face.
*&quot;Pflug&quot;: &quot;plough&quot;
:a position with the sword held to either side of the body with the pommel near the back hip, with the point aiming at the opponent&#x27;s chest or face. Some historical manuals state that when this guard is held on the right side of the body that the short edge should be facing up and when held on the left side of the body the short edge should be facing down with the thumb on the flat of the blade.
*&quot;Alber&quot;: &quot;fool&quot;
:In the Fool&#x27;s Guard, the point of the sword is lowered to the ground, appearing to &quot;foolishly&quot; expose the upper parts of the body and inviting an attack. Although the Fool&#x27;s Guard exposes the upper openings, it does provide excellent protection to the lower openings. From the Fool&#x27;s Guard an attack or displacement can be made with the false edge of the sword, or the hilt of the sword can be quickly raised into a hanging parry.

Additional Guards: Liechtenauer is emphatic that the above four guards are sufficient, and all guards taught by other masters may be derived from them. Later masters introduce richer terminology for variant guards:

*&quot;Zornhut&quot;: &quot;wrath guard&quot;
*&quot;Wechsel&quot;: &quot;change&quot;
*&quot;Nebenhut&quot;: &quot;near guard&quot; or &quot;side guard&quot;
*&quot;Eisenport&quot;: &quot;iron door&quot;, mentioned in 3227a as a non-Liechtenauerian ward, identical to the &quot;porta di ferro&quot; of the Italian school
*&quot;Schlüssel&quot;: &quot;key&quot;
*&quot;Einhorn&quot;: &quot;unicorn&quot;, a variant of Ochs
*&quot;Schrankhut&quot;: &quot;barrier guard&quot;

The following are transitional stances that are not properly called guards:
*&quot;Hengetort&quot;: &quot;hanging point&quot;
*&quot;Kron&quot;: &quot;crown&quot;, the sword hilt is held out about head height with the point up. Kron is used at the bind and is usually a prelude to grappling.
*&quot;Langort&quot;: &quot;long point&quot;, the sword point is extended straight out at the opponent. Many of the cuts pass through this transitional guard, and it is the natural ending of a thrust.

===Techniques===
Other terms in Liechtenauer&#x27;s system (most of them referring to positions or actions applicable in mid-combat, when the blades are in contact) include:

*&quot;Duplieren&quot;: &quot;doubling&quot;, the immediate redoubling of a displaced hew.
*&quot;Mutieren&quot;: &quot;mutating&quot;, change of attack method, changing a displaced hew into a thrust, or a displaced thrust into a hew.
*&quot;Versetzen&quot;: &quot;displacement&quot; or &quot;parrying&quot; (upper/lower, left/right), to parry an attack with one&#x27;s own weapon.
*&quot;Nachreisen&quot;: &quot;after-traveling&quot;, the act of attacking an opponent after he has pulled back to attack, or an attack after the opponent has missed, or an attack following the opponent&#x27;s action.
*&quot;Überlaufen&quot;: &quot;over-running&quot; or &quot;overrunning&quot;, the act of countering a hew or thrust made from below with an attack from above; a slight step backward usually accompanies the attack, the higher blow out-ranging the lower one.
*&quot;Absetzen&quot;: &quot;off-setting&quot;, deflecting a thrust or hew at the same time as stabbing.
*&quot;Durchwechseln&quot;: &quot;changing-through&quot;, name for various techniques of escaping a bind by sliding the sword&#x27;s point out from underneath the blade and then stabbing to another opening.
*&quot;Zucken&quot;: &quot;tugging&quot;, a technique used in a strong bind between blades in which a combatant goes weak in the bind so as to disengage his blade from the bind and stabs or hews to the other side of the other combatant&#x27;s blade. This technique is based upon the concept of using weakness against strength.
*&quot;Durchlauffen&quot;: &quot;running-through&quot;, a technique by which one combatant &quot;runs through&quot; his opponent&#x27;s attack to initiate grappling with him.
*&quot;Händedrücken&quot;: &quot;pressing of hands&quot;, the execution of an &quot;Unterschnitt&quot; (&quot;undercut&quot;) followed by an &quot;Oberschnitt&quot; (&quot;overcut&quot;) such that the wrists of the opponent are sliced all the way around.
*&quot;Hängen&quot;: &quot;hanging&quot; (upper/lower, left/right)
*&quot;Winden&quot;: &quot;Winding&quot;, the combatant moves the strong side of his blade to the weak side of the opponent&#x27;s blade to gain leverage while keeping his point online with the opponent&#x27;s opening. There are eight variations.

===Footwork===
The Fechtbücher themselves rarely if ever mention complex footwork, which caused a debate among historians whether or not there was complex footwork in Liechtenauer&#x27;s system. However, the fencing master Hugo Wittenwiler strongly implies that &quot;fancy footwork&quot; was seen as impractical and even dangerous in the medieval and early modern period. Fencing master Joachim Meyer later added Italian-inspired footwork to his style of longsword fencing in the late 16th century (techniques such as the &quot;Ausfall&quot;, the lunge, which was seemingly unknown or unused in contemporary German swordsmanship of the time. Paulus Hector Mair makes no mention of it in his Fechtbuch which is also from the 16th century. Mair was a contemporary of Mayer).

*&quot;The passing step&quot;: moving the rear foot in front while following with the behind one, all while transferring weight and stability from one foot to the other.

*&quot;The gathering step&quot;: a quick movement with the forward foot while the backfoot stabilizes the fast momentum by being focused sideways.

*&quot;The offline step&quot;: this step begins by moving forward, making a tilt, moving slight backward movement and then attacking with the strong side of the other foot.

==Armoured combat (Harnischfechten)==
Combat in full plate armour made use of the same weapons as &quot;Blossfechten&quot;, the longsword and dagger (possibly of special make optimized for piercing the openings in armour); but the techniques were entirely different. Attacking an opponent in plate armour is carried out in two ways: percussive force or penetration at joints or unprotected areas. Penetration was extremely unlikely even with thrusting attacks. Percussion was realized with the &quot;Mordstreich&quot; (&quot;murder strike&quot;), an attack with the hilt when holding the sword at the blade, and then penetration into openings of the armour with the &quot;Halbschwert&quot; (short sword), which allowed stabbing with greater precision. From the evidence of the Fechtbücher, most armoured fights were concluded by wrestling moves, with one combatant falling to the ground. Lying on the ground, he could then be easily killed with a stab into his visor or another opening of the armour.
