<text>Soyuz T-12 (also known as Salyut 7 EP-4) was the seventh crewed spaceflight to the Soviet space station Salyut 7. The name &quot;Soyuz T-12&quot; is also the name of the spacecraft used to launch and land the mission&#x27;s three-person crew. The mission occurred in July 1984, during the long-duration expedition Salyut 7 EO-3. During the mission, crew member Svetlana Savitskaya became the first woman to ever perform a spacewalk, and the potential Buran space shuttle pilot, Igor Volk, was given spaceflight experience. Unlike many Soyuz visiting missions, the Soyuz lifeboats were not swapped, and the crew returned to Earth in the same spacecraft in which they launched.

==Background==
Igor Volk was a test pilot, and was planned to be the commander of the first Buran spaceflight. The rule introduced following the Soyuz 25 failure insisted that all Soviet spaceflight must have at least one crew member who has been to space before. As a result, it was decided that Volk should have spaceflight experience, and he was originally scheduled to visit Salyut 7 in 1983. But following the failure of Soyuz T-8 to dock to Salyut 7, in April 1983, the Soyuz launch schedule was disrupted, and Volk&#x27;s original crew members, Kizim and Solovyov, were rescheduled elsewhere. They later became long-duration crew members of Salyut 7 EO-3, and Volk was scheduled to fly in the passenger seat of the visiting mission Soyuz T-12 to the EO-3 crew, but the other members of the T-12 mission were not yet decided.

In November 1983, NASA announced that during STS-41-G, Kathryn D. Sullivan would become the first woman to perform a spacewalk. The NPO Energia chief decided that the Soviets would get there first, and assembled the Soyuz T-12 crew within a month of NASA&#x27;s announcement, which included Volk as previously planned.

The back-up crew lists became available to Western space analysts in 1988, and they noted that the back-up crew contained a woman, but did not contain another LII test pilot. Judging from this, it appeared that, as reasons to have the Soyuz T-12 mission, achieving the first female spacewalk was more important than gaining experience for a potential Buran crew member.

At the time of the mission the Buran program was still a state secret. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including the British Interplanetary Society magazine &quot;Spaceflight&quot;, to ask why a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.

==Mission highlights==

Soyuz T-12 was the 7th expedition to Salyut 7.

Volk was a glimpse of things which might have been: he was a Buran programme program pilot being flown in space to prove he would be able to pilot Buran
back to Earth after an extended stay in space.

The crew of Soyuz T-12 (callsign Pamir), the second Visiting Expedition to visit the Mayaks, included veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov, Buran shuttle program cosmonaut Igor Volk, and Svetlana Savitskaya. On July 25 Dzhanibekov and Savitskaya performed a 3 hr, 30 min EVA (Savitskaya became the first woman ever to perform an EVA), during which they tested the URI multipurpose tool. They cut, welded, soldered, and coated metal samples. During the Pamirs&#x27; stay, the six cosmonauts aboard Salyut 7 also conducted Rezonans tests and collected station air samples.

<text>The Shadow Ministry of Tony Abbott was the opposition Coalition shadow ministry of Australia from December 2009 to September 2013, opposing the Australian Labor Party governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard.

The shadow ministry is a group of senior Opposition spokespeople who form an alternative Cabinet to the government&#x27;s, whose members shadow or mark each individual Minister or portfolio of the Government.

Since the 2007 federal election, the Liberal–National Coalition had been the Official Opposition, initially led by Brendan Nelson and later Malcolm Turnbull. In 2009, Tony Abbott defeated Turnbull in a leadership spill 42 votes to 41 in the second round and took on the role of Opposition Leader.

The Abbott shadow ministry was the first in which shadow ministers received additional pay for their roles, taking effect from 2012 after a decision of the Gillard government.

== Structure ==
The &quot;opposition front bench&quot; comprises the full shadow ministry including the shadow cabinet, other shadow ministers and shadow parliamentary secretaries.
As an institution, the shadow cabinet is much less defined—or studied—than the Cabinet with its well established formal procedures. Shadow Cabinet operates more as a committee of an opposition political party than an institution of Government or Parliament. The &quot;Cabinet Handbook&quot; was first published in 1926 and the updated version is available on-line but no such equivalent exists for Shadow Cabinet.

== First arrangement (2009–2010) ==
The Shadow Cabinet of Tony Abbott was created following the accession of Tony Abbott to the leadership in December 2009. It remained largely unchanged until the 2010 election, excluding one minor reshuffle in March 2010. After this reshuffle, Barnaby Joyce gained the Regional Development portfolio from Warren Truss and the Infrastructure and Water Portfolio from Ian Macfarlane. Andrew Robb took on Joyce&#x27;s previous portfolio of Finance and Deregulation and Macfarlane gained the Energy and Resources portfolio from the retiring Nick Minchin.

=== Members of the Outer Shadow Ministry ===

=== Shadow Parliamentary Secretaries ===

== Second arrangement (2010–2013) ==
Tony Abbott reshuffled the Shadow Cabinet following the 2010 election and this arrangement remained largely unchanged until the election of the Abbott government in 2013. Two alterations were made during this period. In March 2011, Michael Ronaldson was appointed Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader of the Opposition on the Centenary of ANZAC. A wider redistribution took place in September 2012 following the resignation of Cory Bernardi. Arthur Sinodinos took on the role of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary Assisting the Leader of the Opposition and Jamie Briggs took on the role of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary of Supporting Families. Michaelia Cash was also appointed Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate.

<text>The United States Senate Democratic Policy Committee is responsible for the creation of new United States Democratic Party policy proposals, supporting Democratic senators with legislative research, developing reports on legislation and policy, conducting oversight hearings, monitoring roll call votes, differentiating between Democratic and Republican positions, and building party unity.

The committee was established in 1947, by an act signed by President Harry S. Truman, alongside its Republican counterpart. From 1947 to 2000, the Democratic leader was also the policy committee chairman. From 1989 to 1999, there was a co-chairman. Starting in 1999, the co-chairman was dropped and the position of policy committee chairman became a separate position elected by the Senate Democratic Caucus. The floor leader served as committee chair until 1989, when one of the co-chairs remained leader (Mitchell through 1995 and then Daschle until 1999). The committee chairman is a member of the Democratic party leadership of the United States Senate.

<doc id="849999" wikidata="Q7522044" url="?curid=849999" title="Sinclair Radionics">
<text>Sinclair Radionics Ltd was a company founded by Sir Clive Sinclair in Cambridge, England which developed hi-fi products, radios, calculators and scientific instruments.

== History ==
After raising funds to start the business by writing articles for &quot;Practical Wireless&quot; magazine, and borrowing £50, Clive Sinclair founded Sinclair Radionics Ltd. on 25 July 1961. Sinclair initially worked alone in the evenings in a room in London (he was still a technical journalist during the day), selling radio kits by mail order.

=== Radios and Hi-Fi ===
Radionics initially developed hi-fi equipment; it released its first product, the Sinclair Micro-amplifier, in December 1962. The assembly and distribution of this product were contracted out to Cambridge Consultants. In 1963 Sinclair Radionics introduced their first radio with the &quot;Sinclair Slimline&quot; in kit form at forty-nine shillings and sixpence (£2.47½).

A year later, in 1964, Sinclair released the &quot;X-10&quot; amplifier, one of the first commercial Class-D amplifiers. In the same year, Sinclair released the &quot;Micro-6&quot;, matchbox-size radio, which the company claimed was the &quot;world&#x27;s smallest radio&quot;—it could also be worn on your wrist with the &quot;Transrista&quot;.

In 1965 the &quot;Micro-FM&quot; debuted as &quot;the world&#x27;s first pocket-size FM tuner-receiver&quot;, but was unsuccessful due to technical difficulties. Despite problems, illegal clones were produced in the far east. Sinclair&#x27;s final 1960s radio kit was the 1967 &quot;Micromatic&quot;, billed as &quot;the world&#x27;s smallest radio&quot; like Sinclair&#x27;s earlier radios. The &quot;Micromatic&quot; was a reasonable success and was sold until 1971. In May 1971 Sinclair Radionics made £85,000 profit on £563,000 turnover; the following year profit increased to £97,000 on turnover of £761,000.

In 1966, Sinclair Radionics re-entered the hi-fi market with the &quot;Stereo 25&quot;, a low-cost pre-amp control system. Production was halted in 1968 due to low supply of transistors which had been purchased in 1964 as rejects from other manufacturers. In 1969 it was replaced by the &quot;Stereo Sixty&quot;. This soon became Sinclair&#x27;s most successful audio product, being the second product of the &quot;Project 60&quot; range. The &quot;Project 60&quot; products sold well and were supplemented by the &quot;Project 605&quot; kit in 1972. It was eventually superseded by the more advanced &quot;Project 80&quot; kit in 1974. In May 1973 Sinclair Radionics generated £1.8 million turnover. The last Sinclair Radionics hi-fi product was the System 4000, in 1974.

Another Sinclair Radionics product that was introduced in 1964 and failed was the first class D amplifier kit rated at 10 watt RMS: a class D switching amplifier that was good in theory but sadly ahead of its time and available technology. The amplifier used low-frequency germanium transistors as pulse width modulators and switches and wrongly relied on the loudspeaker&#x27;s inductance to filter the class D signal into audio. Most often this would short out the output transistors. When it did work the power level was far below 10 watts and Sinclair&#x27;s main advertising channel, &quot;Wireless World&quot; magazine, was so deluged with complaints that it supposedly refused to take further advertisements from Sinclair.

Sinclair Radionics launched the System 2000 amplifier, FM tuner and loudspeaker in 1968. followed by the System 3000 in 1972.

=== Calculators and test equipment ===

In 1972, Radionics launched its first electronic calculator, the &quot;Executive&quot;, which was considerably smaller than its competitors&#x27; by the use of hearing-aid-sized batteries. What had made this possible was it had been discovered that there was considerable latency in the display and memory and that, with the addition of a timer, power could be withheld from these battery-draining components for much of the time, thus greatly extending battery life.

During the majority of the 1970s, Sinclair focused on building the most affordable pocket calculators with the best design. In 1972 Sinclair released the world&#x27;s first slim-line pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive, for £79.95. The calculator only included basic maths functions, and the LED display required much power. It is often credited as being the world&#x27;s first attractively styled calculator that did not require mains power to be used like prior calculators. The Executive was a phenomenal success, earning Sinclair £1.8m in profit. In 1973 the slightly larger Sinclair Cambridge was introduced at a far cheaper price of £29.95 + VAT. A cheaper Executive was also launched shortly after. In addition to expanding the Cambridge range, the Sinclair Scientific was launched in 1975. It was a scientific pocket calculator for the very competitive price of £49.95. In 1977 a revised model, the &quot;Scientific Programmable&quot;, was released at £29.95. The Scientific Programmable Mark 2 was later released, reducing the price to £17.22.

In 1975, Sinclair Radionics launched the Oxford range of briefcase calculators. Sinclair also attempted to capture the top-end calculator market with the Sinclair Sovereign, available in plated gold or silver. The calculator was critically acclaimed for its excellent engineering and design and enjoyed short success. Final attempts at the mass-market for calculators, the Sinclair Enterprise and the President, did not sell well.

In 1974, Radionics launched the DM1 digital multimeter. Such scientific instruments were to form a quiet backbone of Radionics business for the rest of its existence. In marked contrast to the rest of the Sinclair range, the instruments gained a reputation for reliable conventionality rather than often unreliable idiosyncrasy.

=== Black Watch ===
In August 1975, Sinclair introduced the Black Watch digital watch at £17.95 in kit form and £24.95 ready-built, although this wasn&#x27;t available to buy until January 1976. Including a five-digit LED display, it suffered from technical flaws related to the design of the case, the chip, the battery and accuracy. Not only was the watch unreliable, Radionics was not able to fulfil the orders it had taken. As a result, Radionics made its first loss in the financial year April 1974 – April 1975. The Black Watch fiasco had a devastating effect on Sinclair&#x27;s finances, and the company would have gone bankrupt had not the Government, through the National Enterprise Board, stepped in to support it.

=== Portable televisions ===

In 1966, Sinclair Radionics developed the world&#x27;s first portable television, the &quot;Microvision&quot;, but never attempted to sell it because development costs would have been too high based on the complicated design the Microvision used.

In April 1976, the National Enterprise Board bought a 43% stake in Sinclair Radionics for £650,000, and in October the National Research and Development Council agreed to provide £1 million for a revived portable TV project, which was finally launched in January 1977 as the Microvision TV1A and MON1A at £99.95. Supply exceeded demand, and 12,000 units were left unsold until they were sold off cheaply. This resulted in a £480,000 loss for Sinclair. Sir Clive Sinclair was certain that the TV1B model released in 1978 would be more successful, but sales were disappointing.

== Demise ==
In July 1977, the NEB increased its stake in Radionics to 73%. By June 1978 Sinclair Radionics was working on the NewBrain microcomputer project, which was later taken over by Newbury Laboratories.

In May 1979, the NEB announced that it intended to sell Radionics&#x27; calculator and TV interests; they were bought by the ESL Bristol group (as Radionic Products Ltd.) and Binatone respectively. In July Clive Sinclair resigned with a £10,000 golden handshake. In September the NEB renamed what was left of Radionics (i.e. the scientific instrument business) as Sinclair Electronics Ltd.; in January 1980 this was changed to Thandar Electronics Ltd. In 1989, Thandar Electronics Ltd merged with Thurlby Electronics Ltd, forming Thurlby Thandar Instruments Ltd. This company now does business under the name Aim and Thurlby Thandar Instruments (Aim-TTi).

== Sinclair Instrument and Science of Cambridge ==
When it became clear that Radionics was failing, Clive Sinclair took steps to ensure that he would be able to continue to pursue his commercial goals: in February 1975, he changed the name of Ablesdeal Ltd. (an off-the-shelf company he bought in September 1973, for just such an eventuality) to Westminster Mail Order Ltd.; this was changed to Sinclair Instrument Ltd. in August 1975.

Finding it inconvenient to share control after the NEB became involved in Radionics, Sinclair encouraged Chris Curry, who had been working for Radionics since 1966, to leave and get Sinclair Instrument up and running.

Sinclair Instrument developed the &quot;Wrist Calculator&quot; to generate cash, which soon became a commercial success selling in surprising figures. In July 1977 Sinclair Instrument Ltd was renamed to Science of Cambridge Ltd. Around about the same time Ian Williamson showed Chris Curry a prototype microcomputer based around a National Semiconductor SC/MP microprocessor and some parts taken from an earlier Sinclair calculator. This was sold as the MK14 microcomputer kit. Science of Cambridge ultimately became Sinclair Research Ltd.

<text>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport () is an international airport serving the city of Kolkata and the Kolkata metropolitan area. It is the primary aviation hub for eastern and northeastern India. It is located approximately from the city centre. The airport is locally known as Kolkata Airport and Dum Dum Airport before being renamed in 1995 after Subhas Chandra Bose, one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement. The airport&#x27;s IATA code &quot;CCU&quot; is associated with &quot;Calcutta&quot;, the former legal name of the city. Opened in 1924, Kolkata Airport is one of the oldest airports in India.

Spread over an area of , Kolkata Airport is the largest hub for air traffic in the eastern part of the country and one of four operational airports in West Bengal, the others being Bagdogra International Airport in Siliguri, Cooch Behar Airport in Cooch Behar and Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport in Durgapur. The airport handled around 20 million passengers in the financial year 2023–24, making it the sixth-busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic, after Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai airports. The airport is a major centre for flights to Northeast India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Southeast Asia and the Middle Eastern cities of Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi. It is situated across Jessore Road in Dum Dum area of Kolkata metropolitan region.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport was founded in the early 1900s as the Calcutta Aerodrome. The airport traditionally served as a strategic stopover on the air route from North America and Europe to Indochina and Australia. Dakota 3 was the first aircraft to land in the airport. In 1924, KLM began scheduled stops at Calcutta, as part of their Amsterdam to Batavia (Jakarta) route. The same year, a Royal Air Force aircraft landed in Calcutta as part of the first round-the-world expedition by any air force.

The airport began as an open ground next to the Royal Artillery Armoury in Dum Dum. Sir Stanley Jackson, Governor of Bengal, opened the Bengal Flying Club at Dum Dum/Calcutta aerodrome in February 1929. In 1930, the airfield was made fit for use throughout the year, and other airlines began to utilise the airport. Air Orient began scheduled stops as part of a Paris to Saigon route and Imperial Airways began flights from London to Australia via Calcutta in 1933, thus drew many airlines to Calcutta Airport. Many pioneering flights passed through the airport, including Amelia Earhart&#x27;s in 1937.

Calcutta played an important role in the Second World War. In 1942, the United States Army Air Forces 7th Bombardment Group flew B-24 Liberator bombers from the airport on combat missions over Burma. The airfield was used as a cargo aerial port for the Air Transport Command and was also used as a communication centre for the Tenth Air Force.

=== Post-independence ===


Passenger services grew after the Second World War. Calcutta became a destination for the world&#x27;s first jet-powered passenger aircraft, the de Havilland Comet, on a British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) route to London. Furthermore, in 1964 Indian Airlines introduced the first Indian domestic jet service, using Caravelle jets on the Calcutta–Delhi route. Between the 1940s and 1960s, the airport was served by several major airlines including Aeroflot, Air France, Alitalia, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Philippine Airlines, KLM, Lufthansa, Pan Am, Qantas, Swissair, and SAS.

Due to the introduction of longer-haul aircraft and the poor political climate of Calcutta during the 1960s, several airlines discontinued their service to the airport. The 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War saw a large increase of both refugees and disease in Calcutta, causing more airlines to cease services to the city. In 1975, the airport opened the first dedicated cargo terminal in India.

The 1990s saw new growth for Calcutta Airport, as the Indian aviation industry saw the arrival of new airlines such as Jet Airways and Air Sahara. A new domestic terminal named Terminal 2 was opened in 1995 making the international one Terminal 1, and the airport was renamed in honour of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. In 2000, a new international arrival hall was opened.

===Modernisation===


2005 saw the growth of low-cost carriers in the Indian aviation sector, with new airlines including SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Kingfisher Airlines. This led to a dramatic rise in passenger numbers at the airport. Overcrowding in both terminals led to the implementation of a comprehensive modernisation plan for the airport.
Work included an expansion of runway 01L/19R, rapid-exit taxiways and parking bays. The runway was extended by (2790 metres to 3190 metres) on the northern side and on the southern side and was fitted with CAT-I facilities for night use. A 119-year-old mosque that lies 30 metres from the runway&#x27; northern end prohibits further expansion in this direction. The longer runway, 01R/19L, was upgraded from CAT-I to CAT-II ILS status to allow landings in poor visibility. In August 2014, it was announced that the instrument landing system of the primary runway would be upgraded to CAT-IIIb. This allows flights to operate till visibility drops below 50 metres. The secondary runway would be upgraded to CAT-II. The upgrading work started in February 2015 and was completed in January 2018.

The modernisation plan included some improvements of the airport&#x27;s existing terminals, including the addition of extra ticketing counters, check-in kiosks, and cafes to the domestic terminal in 2009. However, the need to replace the airport&#x27;s terminals entirely led to plans for a new integrated terminal, known as T2 to differentiate it from the older domestic block, to serve both international and domestic destinations. A Thai-based company, the Italian-Thai Development (ITD) Corporation (ITD-ITDCem JV, a consortium of ITD and ITD Cementation) and the 125-year-old iconic Project Management Consultant–Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB) was hired with Delhi-based designer Sikka Associates Architects to construct the building. Construction commenced in November 2008, and T2 was inaugurated on 20 January 2013 after overshooting the previous deadlines of July 2011 and August 2012. The former airport hotel &#x27;Ashok&#x27; was demolished to give way for two new five-star luxury hotels and a shopping mall in its place.

Commercial operations were intended to start on 23 January 2013, the 116th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. However, the shift to the new terminal was only completed on 16 March 2013. Airports Council International named it the best improved airport in the Asia-Pacific region in 2014 and 2015.

==Infrastructure==
===Runways===
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport has two parallel runways, the primary runway 01R/19L has a capacity of approximately 35 flights per hour and the secondary runway 01L/19R has a capacity of 15 flights per hour. The secondary runway is usually used as a taxiway when the main runway is used. When the primary runway is shut down for maintenance purposes, the secondary runway is used.

===Hangars and ground services===
Air India operates hangars at the airport, while Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil act as fuellers. Catering facilities are owned by Taj-Sats and Oberoi Flight Services.

===Terminals===
The airport&#x27;s new integrated terminal T2 is spread over and can handle 25 million passengers annually, compared to the previous terminal T1&#x27;s capacity of five million. The terminal is an L-shaped structure, containing six levels. It contains 128 check-in counters that utilise CUTE (Common User Terminal Equipment) technology and has 78 immigration counters and twelve customs counters. Passenger lounges are provided by Air India. The terminal is equipped with 18 aerobridges and a further 57 remote parking bays. There are plans to construct an 18-foot bronze statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the integrated terminal complex.

Kolkata&#x27;s old international and domestic terminals closed permanently when the integrated terminal opened. However, there were plans to renovate the old international terminal to be used for future hajj services, while the domestic terminal could be used by regional airlines. An earlier proposal of continuing low-cost carrier operations from the existing domestic terminal has been shelved due to the need to fully utilise the new integrated terminal&#x27;s capacity, making it the first airport in India to shift even its low-cost domestic airlines to the new integrated building upon completion. However, the old terminal will be replaced by a new terminal T3 to increase the overall capacity.

In the financial year from April 2011 to March 2012, Kolkata Airport served 10.3 million passengers, 85% which were travelling domestically. The withdrawal of Lufthansa&#x27;s service to Frankfurt in March 2012 left Kolkata with no direct connections beyond Asia. However, other international operations increased in 2012. The new terminal has attracted some airlines to expand their route networks to include Kolkata.

In September 2012, the Airports Authority of India upgraded the airport&#x27;s cargo-handling capacity, enabling it to cater for the demand until 2015–16. There has been a 25 per cent growth in international cargo movement to and from Kolkata Airport and a 15 per cent increase in outward transit. Automobile parts accounted for the bulk of the growth in the movement of cargo from the city to other countries. In November 2008 the first Centre for Perishable Cargo (CPC) in West Bengal was opened at the airport. The CPC has an area of and an annual storage capacity of 12,000 million tonnes. The CPC had been undergoing trials that started in June 2008 and were built with a grant-in-aid from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) part of the Commerce Ministry. The volume of export was 21,683 tonnes in 2008–09, during the current fiscal more than 23,042 tonnes of cargo were handled by the airport. Similarly, the volume of import cargo increased from 16,863 tonnes to 18,733 tonnes, increasing over ten per cent during the same period. However, in 2008–09 the total volume of cargo handled by the airport declined by 4.8% from the previous year.

On 3 June 2019, Singapore Airlines operated the Airport&#x27;s first Airbus A350 service from Singapore to Kolkata, enhancing the weekly seat capacity.

==Expansion==

The construction of terminal T2, as well as runway expansion, marked the end of Phase 1 of the project. AAI officials have announced that they are prepared to execute Phase 2 of the Kolkata Airport expansion plan. This involves the construction of a new ATC Tower to provide controllers with a better view of the planes at the new terminal. The building will be accompanied by a 4-storey office complex. Initially, a 112-meter tower was proposed, but the height has been revised multiple times and in 2017 it was decreased to 51.4 meter. The under-construction tower is expected to be complete by late 2023 and will replace the older one constructed in 1972. By July 2024, the construction of the ATC was completed but the installation of all necessary equipment was due.

=== New expansion plan ===
The new terminal T2 inaugurated in 2013 is on the verge of reaching its annual capacity of 26 million passengers four years ahead of the initial projections. To tackle this, AAI has planned to upgrade and expand the airport and increase its passenger capacity by construction of another terminal T1 to handle up to 33 million passengers annually. The new terminal will come up north of the current integrated terminal T2. The new ₹5,000 crore expansion plan will be carried out in two phases over a span of six years. The number of parking bays will be increased to 105 by 2024. Additionally the existing terminal is undergoing an interim expansion of ₹130 crore which will see the terminal handle an additional 2 million passengers annually, bringing the total handling capacity of the existing terminal to 28 million passengers annually.

==== Phase 1 ====
Airport officials said as per the first phase of the expansion plan, the old domestic terminal T1 will be demolished and a 7000 sq. m. new building will be constructed in the area. The building will be linked with the existing terminal of the airport with the help of walkalators and would also have walk-in gates on the ground floor. This building will be used only for boarding and de-boarding of passengers. Passengers arriving in the boarding building would take the connecting bridge to the terminal and then leave the airport. This would reduce peak-hour congestion when several flights do not get enough apron space. This would immediately increase the passenger capacity by a few million and would solve the space crunch for the time being. The new building will be U-shaped where the rectangular section (the location of parking lot of old terminal) will host the check-in counters, security check portals and baggage handling facilities. The two arms (one each at the northern and southern end) will function as concourse and will host operational area, house boarding gates and aerobridges. The rectangular section and southern arm will be built as part of the phase 1. The phase 1 expansion plan has been sanctioned by AAI.

==== Phase 2 ====
The phase 2 of the is yet to receive approval from the aviation ministry. In this phase, the old Air Traffic Navigation Building will be demolished to make way for the northern concourse of the new terminal as mentioned above. The construction of new hangars and bays is also part of the current expansion plan.

===Cargo===
== Statistics ==

As of the financial year 2019–20, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport was again the fifth-busiest airport in India in terms of the total number of passengers served and with respect to the number of flights departing and arriving at the airport, which was about 22 million and 430 flights a day respectively. This was a 0.6% increase from the previous year. Out of which, 19 million passengers were domestic travellers and 3 million were international travellers. The cargo traffic saw a decline of 1.1% from its previous year, with 153,468 metric tonnes of cargo.


==Ground transport==

===Roads===
The airport has a well-established facility of prepaid taxis and air-conditioned buses connecting it to the city centre. Ride-hailing services including Uber and Ola operate here regularly. As part of the larger modernisation programme, a flyover at Nagerbazar and an entry ramp on VIP Road have also been constructed. A flyover from Kestopur to Raghunathpur (near Tegharia) was built to speed up airport-bound traffic. These reduced journey times to the airport. Parking facilities at the new terminal include two underground parking levels accommodating 3000 cars, as well as an outdoor car parking which can handle an additional 2000 cars.

West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) operates air conditioned buses to major parts of Kolkata from 08:00 to 21:00 throughout the week.

===Metro===
Two new Kolkata Metro lines are under construction which will connect to the airport: one from Noapara (Yellow Line), and the other from New Garia (Orange Line). Both lines will converge at the Jai Hind metro station (formerly Biman Bandar metro station).

===Rail===
The airport was connected to the Kolkata Suburban Railway system&#x27;s circular line branch. The long elevated track connected the airport Biman Bandar railway station with Dum Dum Cantonment railway station, passing Jessore Road. Electric multiple unit rolling stocks served the line. However, due to poor patronage and plans to replace it with metro service, the railway line was closed in September 2016 to facilitate construction of the new lines. The remaining infrastructure was dismantled in early 2020 to make space for road upgrades. However station building still exist (as of 2024).

Presently, the nearest two rail stations are Durganagar railway station and Birati railway station.

==Awards==
In 2014 and 2015, the airport won the title of &quot;Best Improved Airport&quot; in the Asia-Pacific region awarded by the Airport Council International. The airport was awarded the &quot;Best Airport by Hygiene Measures in the Asia-Pacific&quot; in 2020 by Airports Council International.

== Accidents and incidents ==
On 2 May 1953, BOAC Flight 783 de Havilland Comet bound for Delhi crashed after takeoff from Calcutta Airport with the loss of 43 lives. Parts of the aircraft were found spread over an area of 8 km², near Jugalgari, a village some 25 miles north-west of Calcutta, suggesting disintegration before impact with the ground.

On 12 June 1968, a Pan-Am Flight (N798PA, named Clipper Caribbean) Boeing 707-321C struck a tree 1128 m short of the runway during a night-time visual approach in rain. The aircraft subsequently crashed and caught fire. The fuselage remained largely intact, although the aircraft&#x27;s landing gear broke off. Out of the 10 crew and 53 passengers aboard, 1 crew member and 5 passengers suffered fatal injuries due to the fire.

On 22 December 2015, a Jet Airways bus slammed into the side of an Air India Regional ATR 42-500 aircraft. There were no fatalities. An investigation revealed that the driver was sleeping.

<text>Micrographia: or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses. With Observations and Inquiries Thereupon is a historically significant book by Robert Hooke about his observations through various lenses. It was the first book to include illustrations of insects and plants as seen through microscopes.

Published in January 1665, the first major publication of the Royal Society, it became the first scientific best-seller, inspiring a wide public interest in the new science of microscopy. The book originated the biological term &quot;cell&quot;.

==Observations==
Hooke most famously describes a fly&#x27;s eye and a plant cell (where he coined that term because plant cells, which are walled, reminded him of the cells of a monastery). Known for its spectacular copperplate of the miniature world, particularly its fold-out plates of insects, the text itself reinforces the tremendous power of the new microscope. The plates of insects fold out to be larger than the large folio itself, the engraving of the louse in particular folding out to four times the size of the book. Although the book is best known for demonstrating the power of the microscope, &quot;Micrographia&quot; also describes distant planetary bodies, the wave theory of light, the organic origin of fossils, and other philosophical and scientific interests of its author.

Hooke also selected several objects of human origin; among these objects were the jagged edge of a honed razor and the point of a needle, seeming blunt under the microscope. His goal may well have been to contrast the flawed products of mankind with the perfection of nature (and hence, in the spirit of the times, of biblical creation). 
==Reception==
Published under the aegis of the Royal Society, the popularity of the book helped further the society&#x27;s image and mission of being England&#x27;s leading scientific organization. &quot;Micrographia&quot; illustrations of the miniature world captured the public&#x27;s imagination in a radically new way; Samuel Pepys called it &quot;the most ingenious book that ever I read in my life&quot;.

==Methods==

In 2007, Janice Neri, a professor of art history and visual culture, studied Hooke&#x27;s artistic influences and processes with the help of some newly rediscovered notes and drawings that appear to show some of his work leading up to &quot;Micrographia.&quot; She observes, &quot;Hooke&#x27;s use of the term &quot;schema&quot; to identify his plates indicates that he approached his images in a diagrammatic manner and implies the study or visual dissection of the objects portrayed.&quot; Identifying Hooke&#x27;s schema as &#x27;organization tools,&#x27; she emphasizes:

Additionally: &quot;Hooke often enclosed the objects he presented within a round frame, thus offering viewers an evocation of the experience of looking through the lens of a microscope.&quot;

<doc id="850010" wikidata="Q2642476" url="?curid=850010" title="Renaming of cities in India">
<text>The renaming of the cities in India started in 1947 following the end of the British imperial period. Several changes were controversial, and not all proposed changes were implemented. Each had to be approved by Government of India in Delhi.

The renaming of states and territories in India has also taken place, but until the 2010s with actual substantial name changes in both local language and in English such as the old British state name of Travancore–Cochin to Kerala (1956). The most notable exceptions are Indian English spelling-changes of &quot;Orissa&quot; to Odisha (2011) and the union territory of &quot;Pondicherry&quot; (which includes the city of Pondicherry) to Puducherry (2006).

==History==
A key aspect of Post-independence India&#x27;s political integration was the harmonization of names and territories of both states and cities. Some changes to nomenclature were introduced in the early years itself. For example, &#x27;Jubbulpore&#x27;, &#x27;Jajesmow&#x27;, &#x27;Cawnpore&#x27; were renamed to Jabalpur, Jajmau and Kanpur in 1947-48. &#x27;United Provinces&#x27; was renamed to Uttar Pradesh in 1950.

A major development occurred when the Government of India brought the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution of India and the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Together, these Acts dispensed with the erstwhile four-fold classification of States and also made major changes to the various state boundaries. The reorganization enhanced administrative convenience and also quelled movements demanding establishment of &#x27;linguistic states&#x27;. 

Later, Madras (the capital of Tamil Nadu) was rebranded as Chennai in 1996. The name of Calcutta, which was amongst the first cities to be settled by the British, was changed to Kolkata (local Bengali pronunciation) in 2001.

==Causes for renaming==
===Need for standardization of spelling===
India has various local languages. Even (Romanised) English spellings in long and wide use often vary depending upon which government department or agency uses them. To the point, a few examples are Quilandy versus Koyilandy (Malayalam: കൊയിലാണ്ടി), Cannanore versus Kannur (Malayalam: കണ്ണൂർ), and Rangiya versus Rangia (Assamese: ৰঙিয়া). Different departments of the government may have used official spellings in use at the time, while locations associated with Indian railways mostly maintained British-era spellings. The confusion inherent in such variations has often resulted in serious consequences like people having two &quot;different&quot; addresses (theoretically designating the same place) in their official records leading to legal disputes, or one house having residents of different house addresses due to differing place names. Many people argue that such confusion can lead to indeterminate and/or unintended consequences.

===Renaming in local languages===
In the post-colonial era, several Indian states&#x27; names were changed. Some of these changes coincided with the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, a major reform of the boundaries of India&#x27;s states and territories that organized them along linguistic lines. At this time, for example, Travancore-Cochin was renamed Kerala (Malayalam: കേരളം). Later state name changes include the reorganization of Madhya Bharat into Madhya Pradesh (Hindi: मध्य प्रदेश) in 1959; and the renaming of the Madras State to Tamil Nadu () in 1969, of the Mysore State to Karnataka (Kannada: ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ) in 1973, and of Uttaranchal to Uttarakhand () in 2007.

Name changes have varied with respect to the levels of language at which they have been applied, and also accepted. Some of these local name changes were changes made in all languages: the immediate local name, and also all India&#x27;s other languages. An example of this is the renaming of predominantly Hindi-speaking Uttaranchal () to a new local Hindi name ( ). Other changes were only changes in some of the indigenous languages. For example, the renaming of the Madras Presidency to Madras State in 1947 and then Tamil Nadu in 1969 required non-Tamil speakers to change from an approximation of the British name ( &quot;Madras Presidency&quot;, then &quot;Madras State&quot; ) to a native Tamil name ( , &#x27;Tamil country&#x27;).

In general, changes to the local names of cities in the indigenous languages are less common. However, a change in English may sometimes also be a reflection of changes in other Indian languages other than the specific local one. For example, the change of Madras () to Chennai () was reflected in many of India&#x27;s languages, and incidentally in English, while the Tamil endonym had always been Chennai and remained unaffected by the change.

===Renaming in English===
====Change in official English spelling====
The renaming of cities is often specifically from English to Indian English in connection with that dialect&#x27;s internal reforms. In other words, the city itself is not actually renamed in the local language, and the local name (or endonym) in the indigenous languages of India does not change, but the official spelling in Indian English is amended. An example is the change from English &quot;Calcutta&quot; to English &quot;Kolkata&quot; – the local Bengali name ( ) did not change. Such changes in English spelling may be in order to better reflect a more accurate phonetic transliteration of the local name, or may be for other reasons. In the early years after Indian independence, many name changes were affected in northern India for English spellings of Hindi place names that had simply been Romanized inconsistently by the British administration – such as the British spelling &quot;Jubbulpore&quot;, renamed Jabalpur () among the first changes in 1947. These changes did not generate significant controversy. More recent and high-profile changes – including renaming such major cities as Calcutta to Kolkata – have generated greater controversy. Since independence, such changes have typically been enacted officially by legislation at local or national Indian government level, and may or may not then be adopted by the Indian media, particularly the influential Indian press. In the case of smaller towns and districts which were less notable outside and inside India, and where a well known English name (or exonym) could not be said to exist, older spellings used under British India may not have had any specific legislation other than changes in practice on the romanization of indigenous Indian language names.

====Realignment of the official Indian English name to an alternative local name====
Aside from changes to the official English spellings of local names there have also been renaming proposals to realign the official name, hence the English name with an alternative local name, typically changing a Muslim name to a Hindu one. Recent examples include the proposals by the Bharatiya Janata Party (1990, 2001) to rename Ahmedabad (Hindi: अहमदाबाद) to Karnavati and Allahabad (Hindi: इलाहाबाद) to Prayagraj (Hindi: प्रयागराज), the latter ultimately being officially adopted in 2018. Similarly, the cities of Aurangabad (Marathi: औरंगाबाद) and Osmanabad (Marathi: उस्मानाबाद) had been renamed Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar (Marathi: छत्रपती संभाजी नगर) and Dharashiv (Marathi: धाराशिव), by then Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackerey, in 2020. These proposals are changes from the Islamic name to a Hindu name.

===Adoption of renamed names===
Official name changes take place quickly if not immediately in official government sources. Adoption may be slower among the media in India and abroad, and among Indian authors.

* Pune to Rajmata Jijau Nagar (Amidst the surge of &quot;Marathification&quot; in Maharashtra after the renaming of Aurangabad and Osmanabad, a NCP MLC, Amol Mitkari has demanded this name change, and although it is highly unlikely to materialize, there has been a &#x27;growing&#x27; movement to rename Pune&#x27;s sister city, Pimpri-Chinchwad as Jijau Nagar)
==Criticism==
2018 developments like renaming of Allahabad (tracing back to Mughal rule) to Prayagraj (ancient name in Sanskrit) and Faizabad district to Ayodhya district (a holy city of Hinduism) in Uttar Pradesh were subject to some controversy. While the BJP-led State Government argued that it was a restoration of its historical name, some critics allege that it was an attempt to enforce a &#x27;Hindutva agenda&#x27; and contradict India&#x27;s constitutional status as a Secular nation.

<text>The Salford Hundred (also known as Salfordshire) was one of the subdivisions (a hundred) of the historic county of Lancashire in Northern England. Its name alludes to its judicial centre being the township of Salford (the suffix &quot;-shire&quot; meaning the territory was appropriated to the prefixed settlement). It was also known as the Royal Manor of Salford and the Salford [[wapentake]].

==Origins==

The Manor or Hundred of Salford had Anglo-Saxon origins. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; recorded that the area was held in 1066 by Edward the Confessor. Salford was recorded as part of the territory of &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot; or &quot;Between Ribble and Mersey&quot;, and it was included with the information about Cheshire, though it cannot be said clearly to have been part of Cheshire.

The area became a subdivision of the County Palatine of Lancaster (or Lancashire) on its creation in 1182.

==Salford Hundred Court==
In spite of its incorporation into Lancashire, Salford Hundred retained a separate jurisdiction for the administration of justice, known as the Court Leet, View of frankpledge, and Court of Record of our Sovereign Lord the King for his Hundred or Wapentake of Salford. Exceptionally for hundred courts, Salford survived until the 19th century. The lordship of Salford passed with the Duchy of Lancaster to the Crown, and a serjeant or bailiff was appointed to administer the hundred on the king&#x27;s behalf. In 1436 the office of Hereditary Steward of the Wapentake of Salfordshire was granted to Sir Richard Molyneux of Sefton. The office was held by Sir Richard&#x27;s successors, the Earls of Sefton until 1972.

The Portmote of the Borough of Salford merged with the Hundred Court in the 17th century, and the latter body took over the administrative business of the manorial borough. In 1792 police commissioners were established in Manchester and Salford, and the Hundred Court was left with few powers. By 1828 the activities of the court consisted of the following:

*A twice-yearly meeting of jury-men chose the borough reeve of Salford, along with two constables, a dog-muzzler, ale-taster and inspectors of flesh and fish for the town. The meeting also appointed constables in those townships that did not possess their own court leet. In these townships it also possessed powers to deal with noxious smells and smoke from factories, clearing obstructions of the highway, fencing of roads, foul ditches and enforcement of weights and measures.
*A three-weekly court for the recovery of debts of less than forty shillings. These were held every third Thursday by one of three deputy stewards (usually prominent local solicitors) appointed by the Earl of Sefton.

===Reform===

In 1846 the court was reformed to become a Court of Record with its jurisdiction extended to debts not exceeding fifty pounds in value. In 1838 Manchester was incorporated as a municipal borough and granted its own court of record. The two courts were merged as the Salford Hundred Court of Record in 1869 by the (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. cxxx). The court had jurisdiction in personal actions only. The municipal boroughs of Oldham, Bolton, Heywood and Rochdale successively had their areas exempted from the jurisdiction of the Hundred Court by Order in Council or private Act of Parliament between 1878 and 1893.
In 1910 a committee was appointed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to report on the practices, area and jurisdiction of the court, and whether it was &quot;of benefit to the parties for whose use it was intended&quot;. One member of the three-man committee recommended the abolition of the court which had &quot;little but its age to justify its continuance&quot;, while the majority called for amending legislation. Accordingly, the (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. clxxii) was passed to restrict the area of the court to the county court areas of Manchester and Salford and to alter its procedures and costs.

Forty years later the court was again referred to a review committee. The committee&#x27;s report recommended that the court be retained as it provided &quot;a popular and speedy remedy for a large number of litigants in the area&quot;. In 1956 the court&#x27;s area was extended to encompass the entire County Borough of Stockport, which was deemed to belong to the County of Lancashire and the Hundred of Salford for the purposes of assizes, quarter sessions and licensing. The Court of Record for the Hundred of Salford was abolished by section 43(1)(d) of the Courts Act 1971. The last hereditary steward, Hugh Molyneux, 7th Earl of Sefton died on 13 April 1972.

===Prisons===
Separate places of detention were maintained for the hundred: the New Bailey Prison in Salford, which was replaced by Strangeways Prison in 1868.

==Constituent areas==

The area it occupied, , corresponds loosely to the modern metropolitan county of Greater Manchester, though excludes those parts from the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, as well as most of that that forms the modern Metropolitan Borough of Wigan. Its area also extended into territory north of what is now Greater Manchester, including parts of Rossendale and Todmorden.

The parish of Manchester formed part of Salfordshire. It has been suggested that a Manchester-shire hundred was not favoured over one centred at Salford because Manchester had been ravaged as part of the Viking occupation.

The parish of Rochdale, in Salfordshire, included the chapelry of Saddleworth from the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire.

===Parishes and townships===
Salfordshire comprised several parishes and townships during its history. These were not static, but fragmented with the establishment of daughter churches and chapels and increases in population. The parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham originally included the parishes of Bury, Middleton and Radcliffe, and the parish of Manchester originally included the parish of Ashton-under-Lyne. The township of Hundersfield was one of Rochdale parish&#x27;s four original townships, but was itself split into four. Similarly, Prestwich-cum-Oldham was later split into two separate parishes of Prestwich and Oldham.

In 1830, Salfordshire was documented to consist of the following parishes and townships:

<text>Bipin Chandra Pal ( ; 7 November 1858 – 20 May 1932) was an Indian nationalist, writer, orator, social reformer and freedom fighter. He was one third of the &quot;Lal Bal Pal&quot; triumvirate. He was one of the main architects of the Swadeshi movement. He is known as the Father of Revolutionary Thoughts in India. He also opposed the partition of Bengal by the British colonial government.

==Early life and background of Pal==
Bipin Chandra Pal was born on 7 November 1858 to a wealthy Bengali Kayastha family in the village of Pail in Habiganj, then part of the Bengal Presidency&#x27;s Sylhet District. His father was Ramchandra Pal, a Persian scholar, and small landowner. His father subsequently joined the Sylhet bar as a lawyer. He studied and taught at the Church Mission Society College (now the St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Mission College), an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta. He also studied comparative theology for a year (1899-1900) at New Manchester College, Oxford in England but did not finish the course. His son was Niranjan Pal, one of the founders of Bombay Talkies. One son-in-law was the ICS officer, S. K. Dey, who later became a union minister. His other son-in-law was a freedom fighter Ullaskar Dutta who married Lila Dutta his childhood love.

Family of Bipin Chandra Pal-
Brother- Kunja Govinda Pal
Nephew- Suresh Chandra Pal - Son - Niranjan Pal (founder of Bombay Takies) Grandson- Colin Pal (writer of Shooting Star) film director Great Grandson - Deep Pal (Steadicam camerawork). As revolutionary as he was in politics, Pal was the same in his private life. After his first wife died he married a widow and joined the Brahmo Samaj.

==Work==

Pal is known as the &quot;Father of Revolutionary Thoughts&quot; in India. Pal became a major leader of the Indian National Congress. At the Madras session of Indian National Congress held in 1887, Bipin Chandra Pal made a strong plea for repeal of the Arms Act which was discriminatory in nature. Along with Lala Lajpat Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak he belonged to the Lal-Bal-Pal trio that was associated with revolutionary activity. Sri Aurobindo Ghosh and Pal were recognised as the chief exponents of a new national movement revolving around the ideals of Purna Swaraj, Swadeshi, boycott and national education. His programme consisted of Swadeshi, boycott and national education. He preached and encouraged the use of Swadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods to eradicate poverty and unemployment. He wanted to remove social evils from the form and arouse the feelings of nationalism through national criticism. He had no faith in mild protests in the form of non-cooperation with the British colonial government. On that one issue, the assertive nationalist leader had nothing in common with Mahatma Gandhi. During the last six years of his life, he parted company with the Congress and led a secluded life. Sri Aurobindo referred to him as one of &quot;mightiest prophets of nationalism&quot;. Bipin Chandra Pal made efforts to remove social and economic ills. He opposed the caste system and advocated widow remarriage. He advocated a 48-hour working week and demanded a hike in the wages of workers. He expressed his disdain for Gandhi&#x27;s ways, which he criticised for being rooted in &quot;magic&quot; instead of &quot;logic&quot;.

As a journalist, Pal worked for &quot;Bengal Public Opinion&quot;, &quot;The Tribune&quot; and &quot;New India&quot;, where he propagated his brand of nationalism. He wrote several articles warning India of the changes happening in China and other geopolitical situations. In one of his writings, describing where the future danger for India would come from, Pal wrote under the title &quot;Our Real Danger&quot;.

<text>Louis, Dauphin of France (1 November 1661 – 14 April 1711), commonly known as le Grand Dauphin, was the eldest son and heir apparent of King Louis XIV and his spouse, Maria Theresa of Spain. He became known as the Grand Dauphin after the birth of his own son, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, the Petit Dauphin. He and his son died before his father and thus never became kings. Instead, his grandson became King Louis XV at the death of Louis XIV, and his second son inherited the Spanish throne as Philip V through his grandmother.

==Biography==

Louis was born on 1 November 1661 at the Château de Fontainebleau, the eldest son of Louis XIV of France and Maria Theresa of Spain (who were double-first cousins to each other). As a &quot;Fils de France&quot; (&quot;Son of France&quot;) he was entitled to the style of &quot;Royal Highness.&quot; He was baptised on 24 March 1662 at the chapel of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and given his father&#x27;s name of Louis. At the ceremony, the Cardinal de Vendôme and the Princess of Conti acted as proxies for the godparents, Pope Clement IX and Henrietta Maria of England. The latter was Louis&#x27;s great-aunt. It was for this occasion that Jean-Baptiste Lully composed the motet &quot;Plaude Laetare Gallia&quot;.

He was initially under the care of royal governesses, among them being Julie d&#x27;Angennes and Louise de Prie de La Mothe-Houdancourt. When Louis reached the age of seven, he was removed from the care of women and placed in a society of men. He received Charles de Sainte-Maure, as his governor and was tutored by the great French preacher and orator Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, the Bishop of Meaux, seemingly without acceptable results.

Philippe Erlanger writes the following in his book about the life of Louis XIV:

He was very indolent. As an adult, his favorite amusement was lying stretched in a sofa tapping the point of his shoes with a cane. Nonetheless, his generosity, affability, and liberality gave him great popularity in Paris and with the French people in general. Louis was one of six legitimate children of his parents. The others all died in early childhood; the second longest-lived, Marie Thérèse of France, died at the age of five when Louis was 11.

According to John B. Wolf, Louis XIV had a low opinion of his son, writing:

Being especially interested in geopolitical ties his son could help him form, the King considered various European royal daughters as possible wives for his heir, such as Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici and Louis&#x27; cousin Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, daughter of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans and Henrietta of England. According to various sources, Marie Louise and Louis were in love and had grown up with each other. However, Louis XIV decided to use Marie Louise to instead forge a link with Spain and made her marry the invalid Charles II of Spain, the Dauphin&#x27;s half-uncle.

Louis was eventually engaged to his second cousin, Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, when he was seven. She was a year older than Louis and, upon arriving at the French court, was described as being very unattractive. Nonetheless, she was a very cultured princess, and made a good first impression as she was able to speak French fluently.

They were married by proxy in Munich on 28 January 1680; the couple met for the first time on 7 March 1680 in Châlons-sur-Marne.

==Political and military role==
Although he was permitted at first to attend and later to participate in the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;en haut&quot;, Louis did not play an important part in French politics. Nonetheless, as the heir to the throne, he was constantly surrounded by cabals battling for future prominence. Apart from the minor political role that he played during his father&#x27;s reign, Louis engaged in more leisurely pursuits and was esteemed for his magnificent collection of art at Versailles and Meudon. Louis XIV purchased Meudon for him from the widow of Louvois. The Dauphin employed Jules Hardouin Mansart and the office of the &quot;Bâtiments du Roi&quot; but most particularly his long-term &quot;house designer&quot;, Jean Bérain, head of the Menus Plaisirs, to provide new decors. He lived quietly at Meudon for the remainder of his life and was surrounded by his two half-sisters Marie Anne de Bourbon and the Princess of Condé, both of whom he loved dearly. The three made up the main part of the &quot;Cabal de Meudon&quot;, which opposed the Dauphin&#x27;s son Louis and his Savoyard wife, the Duchess of Burgundy.

During the War of the Grand Alliance, he was sent in 1688 to the Rhineland front. Before leaving the court, Louis was thus instructed by his father: In sending you to command my army, I am giving you an opportunity to make known your merit; go and show it to all Europe, so that when I come to die it will not be noticed that the King is dead. 
There, Louis succeeded, under the tutelage of Marshal de Duras and Vauban, in taking one of the bridgeheads across the Rhine, Philippsburg, which was surrounded by marshes. Louis&#x27;s courage was shown when he visited the soldiers in the inundated trenches under heavy fire to observe the progress of the siege. Montausier, his former governor, wrote to him: 
I shall not compliment you on the taking of Philippsburg; you had a good army, bombs, cannons and Vauban. I shall not compliment you because you are brave. That virtue is hereditary. But I rejoice with you that you have been liberal, generous, humane, and have recognised the services of those who did well.
Louis&#x27;s capture of Philippsburg prevented the large gathering Imperial Army from crossing the Rhine and invading Alsace.

Louis&#x27;s position in the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;en haut&quot; gave him an opportunity to have his voice heard in the years and in the crises leading up to the War of the Spanish Succession. From his mother, Louis had rights and claims to the Spanish throne. His uncle Charles II of Spain had produced no descendants and, as he lay dying, had no heir to whom he could pass the throne. The choice of a successor was essentially split between the French and Austrian claimants. To improve the chances of a Bourbon succession, Louis gave up his and his eldest son&#x27;s rights in favour of his second son, Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), who, as the second son, was not expected to succeed to the French throne, which would thus keep France and Spain separate. Moreover, in the discussions in the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;en haut&quot; regarding the French response to Charles II&#x27;s last will and testament, which indeed left all Spanish possessions to Anjou, Louis persuasively argued for acceptance. He opposed those who advocated a rejection of the will and the adherence to the Partition Treaty, which was signed with William III of England, even though the treaty had awarded Naples, Sicily and Tuscany to him.

Louis died of smallpox on 14 April 1711, at the age of 49, and so predeceased his father.

==Literary tribute==

*The &quot;Delphin Classics&quot; were a large edition of the Latin classics, edited in the 1670s for Louis (&quot;Delphin&quot; is the adjective derived from &quot;dauphin&quot;) and known for being written (unlike some other treatments) entirely in that language. Thirty-eight scholars contributed to the series, which was edited by Pierre Huet, with assistance from several co-editors including Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet and Anne Dacier.

==Marriages==
Louis married Duchess Maria Anna of Bavaria on 7 March 1680. She was known in France as &quot;Dauphine Marie Anne Victoire&quot;. Although the marriage was not a close one, the couple had three sons. The &quot;Dauphine&quot; died in 1690 and in 1695 Louis secretly married his lover Marie Émilie de Joly de Choin. His new wife did not acquire the status of Dauphine of France, and the marriage remained without surviving issue. Pregnant at the time of her marriage, de Choin gave birth to a son, who was secretly sent to the countryside; the child died aged two, in 1697, without having been publicly named.

===Issue ===
* Louis, Duke of Burgundy (16 August 1682 – 18 February 1712), Duke of Burgundy and later Dauphin of France; married his double-second cousin, Marie Adélaïde of Savoy, elder daughter of the Duke of Savoy and was the father of the future Louis XV of France;
* Philip V, King of Spain (19 December 1683 – 9 July 1746), Duke of Anjou and later King of Spain; married firstly his double-second cousin, Maria Luisa of Savoy, younger daughter of the Duke of Savoy, and had issue; married, secondly, Elisabeth Farnese and had issue including the future Dauphine of France, Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain and Charles III, the future King of Spain and Mariana Victoria, the Queen of Portugal.
* Charles, Duke of Berry (31 July 1686 – 5 May 1714), Duke of Berry, of Alençon and of Angoulême, Count of Ponthieu; married Marie Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans and had issue but none survived over a year.

Thus, through his two older sons Burgundy and Anjou, Louis ensured, respectively, the continuation of the senior Bourbon line on the throne of France and the establishment of the Spanish Bourbon dynasty.

Besides his unnamed child with Mme de Choin, Louis had two illegitimate daughters with Françoise Pitel:
*Anne Louise de Bourbon (1695 – August 1716) – wife of Anne Errard d&#x27;Avaugour;
*Charlotte de Fleury (6 February 1697 – 1750) – wife of Gérard Michel de La Jonchère.
With another mistress, Marie Anne Caumont de La Force, he had one daughter:
*Louise Émilie de Vautedard (1694–1719) – wife of Nicolas Mesnager.

==Ancestry==
Louis&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Louis XIII of France and Anne of Austria; he was descended, on his mother&#x27;s side, from Philip IV of Spain and Élisabeth of France. Louis XIII and Élisabeth de Bourbon were siblings (the children of Henry IV of France and Marie de&#x27; Medici), as were Anne of Austria and Philip IV, who were the children of Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria. That means that he had only four great-grandparents instead of the usual eight, and that his double-cousin parents had the same coefficient of co-ancestry (1/4) as if they were half-siblings.

<text>A by-election in [[Beckenham (constituency)|Beckenham]], England, was called in 1997 when the sitting Member of Parliament, Piers Merchant (Conservative), resigned from Parliament on 21 October 1997. The Conservatives held the seat, with Jacqui Lait winning the by-election on 20 November.

==Background==
Piers Merchant had been under pressure during the May 1997 general election after tabloid newspaper stories about his relationship with a bar hostess whom he had employed as a researcher, but he had denied any impropriety, and retained the confidence of his local association. His resignation on 21 October was caused by further newspaper stories and video footage which confirmed that his denial had been misleading. He accepted the office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead.

At the by-election, the Conservatives selected Jacqui Lait, who had lost her seat at Hastings in the general election. The Labour candidate, Robert (Bob) Hughes, was a long time resident of the constituency and had contested the seat at the general election. The Liberal Democrats also chose their general election candidate, Rosemary Vetterlein. The Conservatives were successful in retaining the seat with a further reduced majority.

Also held on the same day was a by-election at Winchester. This was the last election (general or by-election) that the Referendum Party contested; it wound up soon afterwards.

<doc id="850037" wikidata="Q2803538" url="?curid=850037" title="Treaty of London (1700)">
<text>The Treaty of London (1700) (, ) or Second Partition Treaty was the second attempt by Louis XIV of France and William III of England to impose a diplomatic solution to the issues that led to the 1701-1714 War of the Spanish Succession. Both divided the Spanish Empire without prior consultation and since the Spanish viewed an undivided Empire as non-negotiable, historians generally view them as largely unenforceable.

Charles II of Spain became the last ruler of Habsburg Spain at the age of five in 1665. He suffered from ill health most of his life and despite marrying twice, by 1698 it was clear he would die without children, leaving the question of his successor unresolved. Although no longer the leading European power, the Empire remained a strong global presence and as the closest heirs were from the Austrian Habsburg and French Bourbon families, acquisition by either would significantly impact the European balance of power.

Hoping to avoid another costly conflict like the Nine Years&#x27; War, in 1698 William and Louis agreed the Treaty of The Hague (1698), or First Partition Treaty, making Joseph Ferdinand heir to the Spanish throne. It became redundant when he died of smallpox in February 1699 and the Treaty of London replaced him with Archduke Charles, younger son of Emperor Leopold I. It ultimately failed to prevent the outbreak of war in July 1701.

==Background==
In 1665, Charles II of Spain became the last ruler of Habsburg Spain at the age of five. He suffered from ill health most of his life and despite marrying twice, by 1698 it seemed he was likely to die childless. Although Spain&#x27;s financial and military power had declined during the 17th century, the Spanish Empire remained largely intact, with territories in Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines and the Americas. Since the closest heirs were from the Austrian Habsburg and French Bourbon families, the succession was of great significance to the European balance of power and was a matter of debate for many years. For example, in the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover, Charles II of England agreed to support the claim of Louis XIV of France.

William III of England saw the Partition Treaties as a way of building on the relationship established at the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick with Louis XIV to create a lasting peace. Imposing a solution to such an important issue on Spain and Austria seemed unlikely with the levels of mistrust between both signatories, which had been at war almost continuously since 1670. William negotiated both treaties without notifying either Parliament or his own ministers, a practice still common in France but not in England. Lord Somers, part of the Whig Junto that managed the English government for William, was generally hostile to the provisions of the First Partition Treaty about which he had learned only shortly before its signature.

Few of William&#x27;s ministers in either England or the Dutch Republic trusted Louis, an impression strengthened when the Marquis d&#x27;Harcourt was sent as envoy to Madrid in November 1698 to build Spanish support for a French candidate. The Spanish were unwilling to allow their empire to be partitioned without consultation to suit the needs of foreign powers. On 14 November 1698, Charles published his will, which made the six-year-old Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria heir to an undivided Spanish Empire and thus ignored the territorial adjustments specified in the First Partition Treaty. When Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox in February 1699, another solution was required.

==Negotiations==
The Spanish court was split into pro-Austrian and pro-French factions, the latter being led by Cardinal Portocarrero, Archbishop of Toledo. For much of Charles&#x27;s reign, his government was controlled by the pro-Austrians, headed by his mother, Mariana of Austria, then following her death in 1696 by his second wife, Maria Anna of Neuburg. Under their influence, Spain joined the anti-French coalition during the Nine Years&#x27; War, which proved a disastrous decision. By 1696, France held most of Catalonia, while Spain was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1692; although Maria Anna managed to retain power with the help of spurious rumours of her pregnancy, Charles was forced to banish her German entourage.

For various reasons, the Austrians were unpopular with most of the Spanish nobility, while Charles also resented their arrogance and made it clear to Harcourt that he would not agree to partition the empire. Many Spanish politicians preferred a French candidate since the wars of the last 50 years suggested France was a better ally than opponent, and its location meant it was better equipped to protect Spain than Austria.

After the death of Joseph Ferdinand, Louis&#x27;s senior foreign policy advisor, the Marquess of Torcy, quickly drew up a draft proposal with revised terms approved in principle by William in June 1699. However, when the suggested treaty was presented to Emperor Leopold, he initially refused the territorial concessions required and as a result the Dutch delayed formal consent. This meant it was not until 12 March 1700 that the treaty was formally signed in London, then in The Hague on 24th.

==Provisions==

The main change from the First Treaty was to replace Joseph Ferdinand as heir to the Spanish throne with Leopold&#x27;s younger son Archduke Charles; Spain retained its empire outside Europe and the Spanish Netherlands but France would gain the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, the Spanish province of Gipuzkoa and exchange the Duchy of Lorraine for the Duchy of Milan. France would then transfer Naples and Sicily to Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia in exchange for the Counties of Nice and Savoy, the transalpine territories of the Savoyard state which finally become part of France after the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859.

Although Leopold accepted the principle of dividing the Spanish Empire in return for making his son king, he objected to France being granted Spanish possessions in Italy, particularly Milan which he considered essential to the security of Austria&#x27;s southern borders. In addition, Lorraine was an Imperial state occupied by France in 1670 and returned only in 1697, and its recently-restored hereditary Duke of Lorraine was Leopold&#x27;s nephew. As a result, enforcing its terms was unlikely since neither Leopold nor Victor Amadeus would agree the territorial exchanges required, while Spain would not accept even the principle.

==Aftermath==
When the Spanish learned of the terms of the Treaty of London in mid-June, Charles amended his will in favour of Archduke Charles and again specified an undivided monarchy. In September, he became ill once more, and by the 28th, he was no longer able to eat. His death seemed imminent, and on 2 October, Portocarrero persuaded him to alter his will in favour of Philip of Anjou, younger son of Louis, Grand Dauphin and grandson of Louis XIV. He died on 1 November 1700, five days before his 39th birthday 

When Louis received the formal Spanish offer to Philip on 9 November, one option was to reject it and insist on Archduke Charles accepting the throne as stipulated by the Treaty of London; this meant that if Leopold continued to refuse the territorial concessions, in theory Louis could then call on England and the Dutch Republic to join him in enforcing it. However, it seems unlikely that this was ever seriously considered since as William noted, it made no sense &quot;to go to war...for a treaty I have only made to prevent war&quot;. Philip was proclaimed Philip V of Spain on 16 November and the War of the Spanish Succession began in July 1701.

The treaty not only failed to prevent the outbreak of war in 1701 but also demonstrated that monarchs could no longer simply impose their solutions on nation states. When Parliament finally learned of the terms in March 1700, their reaction was one of fury, partly because they were seen as damaging English commercial interests, but also because they had been approved without their knowledge or consent. The Tory majority subsequently attempted to impeach Somers for his role in the negotiations and while unsuccessful, the process embittered relations between the two parties and had a profound impact on British politics over the next two decades.

<text>The West Derby [[Hundred (county division)|Hundred]] (also known as West Derbyshire) is one of the six subdivisions of the historic county of Lancashire, in northern England. Its name alludes to its judicial centre being the township of West Derby (the suffix &quot;-shire&quot; meaning the territory was appropriated to the prefixed settlement).

It covered the southwest of Lancashire, containing the ancient ecclesiastical parishes of Walton, Sefton, Childwall, Huyton, Halsall, Altcar, North Meols, Ormskirk, Aughton, Warrington, Prescot, Wigan, Leigh, Liverpool, and Winwick. It corresponds roughly to areas of Merseyside north of the River Mersey and also covered parts of modern West Lancashire Borough, Wigan borough, Warrington Borough and Halton Borough.

==History==

===Domesday Book===
When the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; was compiled, this hundred was composed of three separate hundreds of West Derby, Warrington and Newton-in-Makerfield. The hundreds possibly united in the reign of Henry I. The hundred is surrounded on the west by the Irish Sea and in the south west and south by the River Mersey and Glazebrook, to the east is Salford Hundred and to the north east the River Douglas and Leyland Hundred. Apart from the manor which contained West Derby Castle, said to have been built by Roger of Poitou, there were several other manors which were owned by the Lord of the manor for his own use. At the time of the Conquest these manors incorporated six berewicks encompassing the villages of Thingwall, Liverpool, Great Crosby, Aintree, Everton, Garston and Hale. The main landowner at the time is listed as Uhtred (sometimes spelt Uchtred or Uhtræd) 

===Expansion of the boundaries===
By the end of the 12th century the three separate hundreds had united and West Derby Castle was an important administrative centre rivalling Lancaster in the north of the county. Its position was strengthened by its proximity to the Port of Liverpool, which was founded by King John, trade with Cheshire and the passage of ferries from Liverpool to Birkenhead. By 1327 West Derby Castle was reported to be in ruins.

===Court and laws on the hundred===
A Wapentake court was held every three weeks with the steward of the hundred officiating. There had been a courthouse in West Derby for over 1000 years since the time of the Vikings. The present courthouse situated in West Derby is from a building which was constructed during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The court was used for the presentation of minor offences, or breaches of any laws within the hundred. The King, or lord of the manor had his own bailiff, who was the officer to the sheriff, who had the duty to ensure peace within the hundred and collect any taxes or levys from the people. From the reign of Stephen of England to that of Henry IV this office was a hereditary title held by members of the Walton family of Walton-on-the-Hill. By the fifteenth century the master of the forest was held by members of the Molyneux family, who also held the title of steward of the hundred.

===Land changes hands===
On 18 October 1229, Henry III granted all land from the Ribble to the Mersey, including West Derby, Liverpool, the village of Salford, and the wapentake of Leyland to Ranulf Earl of Chester and Lincoln. When he died in 1232 without any heir the land was inherited by William de Ferrers, through his wife Agnes, sister of the late earl. The land was then passed on to his son William, and then to his son Robert. In 1263, Robert held court against several people who had committed offences against the deer of his forest. In 1266 he rebelled against the rule of the King Henry III and was beaten at the Battle of Chesterfield, following this he was stripped of his title and land, which returned to the hands of the Crown, which was then given to Edmund, the King&#x27;s second son, who was later created Earl of Lancaster. The title and land followed the line of descent of honour of Lancaster from Edmund until it was merged into the Crown in 1413, and is vested in the reigning monarch.
===19th Century===
In 1835 and 1895, Liverpool expanded to include West Derby. In 1889, all remaining administrative functions of historic counties were replaced by Administrative counties of England.

<text>The Fleet Marine Force warfare insignia, also known as the Fleet Marine Force badge or FMF pin, are three military badges of the United States Navy which are issued to those U.S. Navy officers and sailors who are trained and qualified to perform duties in support of the United States Marine Corps. There are currently three classes of the Fleet Marine Force pin, being that of enlisted, officer, and chaplain.

==Enlisted==


The Fleet Marine Force enlisted warfare specialist device (FMFEWS) is a qualification insignia of the United States Navy earned by enlisted U.S. Navy sailors assigned to the Fleet Marine Force of the U.S. Marine Corps who have successfully completed the requirements of the Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) program per OPNAV Instruction 1414.4B. This involves serving one year with a Marine Corps unit (two years for reserves), passing the Marine physical fitness test (PFT), a written test, demonstrating skills used in service with the Marines such as weapon breakdown and familiarization, land navigation, combat communications and an oral examination by senior enlisted sailors who are FMF qualified. The Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist designation is most commonly awarded to the hospital corpsman (HM) and religious program specialist (RP) ratings, although it is also awarded to other sailors who support Marine Corps commands (e.g. logistics specialists assigned to medical logistics companies). It was created in 2000.

An enlisted U.S. Navy sailor who has qualified may place the designator (FMF) after their rating; for example, HM3 John Doe, having qualified, is identified as HM3 (FMF) Doe. , all U.S. Navy corpsmen assigned to a Marine unit are required to earn the FMF badge within 18 months of their being assigned to said unit.

===Enlisted requirements===
When qualifying for the enlisted Fleet Marine Force warfare specialist pin, a sailor (typically a hospital corpsman, logistics specialist, religious programs specialist, personnel specialist, along with some construction battalion &quot;SeaBee&quot; units [when directly assigned to a U.S. Marine Corps combatant command]) is required to have detailed knowledge on the following subjects:

&quot;CORE&quot;
*Safety fundamentals (operational risk management)
*Marine Corps History, Rank Structure, and Courtesies (notable dates, personnel, battles, and Naval courtesies as they pertain to the USMC)
*Marine Corps Mission and Organization 
*Administrative Fundamentals (Naval correspondence, courts martial, and service record information)
*General Combat Leadership Fundamentals (Combat elements, POW rights and responsibilities, Military Code of Conduct)
*First Aid and Field Sanitation Fundamentals (Triage, MEDEVAC &amp; CASEVAC classifications, &quot;Self&quot; and &quot;Buddy&quot; aid skill sets for non-medical personnel)
*Security Fundamentals (Security classifications, terrorism, lethal force, and guard skills training)
*Field Communication Fundamentals (hands on detailed knowledge of the PRC-119 SINCGARS radio, loading frequencies and communication of the 9-Line CASEVAC message)
*Weapons Fundamentals (Detailed knowledge of small arms such as the M9, M16A4, M4, M1014, M67 grenade, M203, and M249 SAW) and machine gun platforms (M240G, M2 .50 cal, Mk19)
*Tactical Fundamental Procedures (platoon hand and arm signals, SALUTE and SMEAC reports, fighting positions, MOPP gear, formation movements in day/night conditions)
*Marine Corps Operations Fundamentals (In-depth knowledge of all USMC aircraft, US Navy amphibious transports, hospital ships, as well as Urban warfare examples, and Military Operations Other Than War examples)
*Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense Fundamentals (minefield signage and detailed signs, symptoms, &amp; treatment of chemical agent exposures)
*Drill and Ceremonies Fundamentals (breakdowns of formations, drill &amp; cadence, color guards, and formal ceremonies)
*Land Navigation Fundamentals (Map reading and compass handling)

Additionally a second section of the course is detailed toward the element of the United States Marine Corps with which the candidate is assigned. For example: a line corpsman with an infantry battalion will learn the ground combat element (GCE).

&quot;GCE&quot;
*Infantry fundamentals (mission &amp; structure of the Marine division, regiment, battalion, infantry &amp; weapons companies, platoon, squad, and fire teams)
*Marine artillery regiment (mission, structure, equipment of the artillery battalion; such as the M198 or M777 howitzer)
*Tank battalion fundamentals (mission, structure, and equipment of the tank battalion; such as the M1A1, TOW missile, M88A1E1 Hercules, and M60A1 bridge vehicle)
*Assault Amphibious Battalion Fundamentals (mission, structure, and vehicles of the AAB; such as the AAVP7A1, AAVC7A1 and AAVR7A1)
*Combat Engineer Battalion Fundamentals (mission, structure, mobility/counter mobility/survivability tasks of the CEB, Engineer Support Company, and Combat Engineer Company)
*Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion (mission, structure, and vehicles of the LAV Battalion; such as the LAV-25, LAV-M, LAV-AT, LAV-C2, LAV-R, and LAV-L)
*Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion Fundamentals (mission, tasks, and training of Force Recon and Division Recon)
Furthermore, to finally qualify, a candidate is expected to perform a disassembly and reassembly of many of the taught weapon systems, operate a SINCGARS radio, plot various points on a map, perform various carries and life saving medical techniques, and in many cases perform (and pass) a Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test (PFT) and Combat Fitness Test (CFT).

Although this qualification is for enlisted personnel serving in the United States Navy, it is unique in that only Commanding Generals or Commanding Officers of qualifying U.S. Marine Corps commands (Division, Group, or Wing) can approve awarding of the designation. As such, to some corpsmen it is the most coveted warfare insignia within the hospital corpsman community.

The eagle, globe, and anchor (EGA) makes a clear statement that the wearer is a member of the Navy/Marine Corps team. The crossed rifles symbolize the rifleman ethic of the Marine Corps; every Marine is a rifleman, just as every Sailor is a firefighter and damage controlman aboard ship and submarine. The surf and sand represent the &quot;littoral zone,&quot; the coastal regions where sailors have served alongside Marines as they earned their reputation and world&#x27;s respect -- &quot;the shores of Tripoli&quot; and the &quot;sands of Iwo Jima.&quot; The scroll at the bottom stating &quot;Fleet Marine Force&quot; shows the exclusive community they belong to.

==Officer==
The Fleet Marine Force Warfare Officer (FMFWO) Insignia is earned by Navy officers assigned to the Fleet Marine Force of the U.S. Marine Corps who have completed the requirements including serving for one year in a Marine Corps command, completing a written test, passing the Marine PFT, and an oral board conducted by FMF qualified officers. The FMF Qualified Officer Insignia is most commonly earned by staff officers in the medical fields and chaplains, although it is also awarded to other officer communities, such as Civil Engineer Corps and naval gunfire officers. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis became FMF qualified while serving as a JAG officer. 

The FMFWO insignia is a gold, highly polished, metal device depicting the eagle, globe and anchor (EGA) atop two crossed rifles on a background of ocean swells breaking on a sandy beach atop a scroll with the words &quot;Fleet Marine Force.&quot;

The EGA makes a clear statement that the wearer is a member of the Navy/Marine Corps team. The crossed rifles symbolize the rifleman ethic of the Marine Corps; every marine is a rifleman, just as every sailor is a firefighter and damage controlman aboard ship and submarine. The surf and sand represent the &quot;littoral zone,&quot; the coastal regions where sailors have served alongside Marines as they earned their reputation and world&#x27;s respect -- &quot;the shores of Tripoli&quot; and the &quot;sands of Iwo Jima.&quot; The eagle, continents, and rifles are highlighted with a highly polished silver finish. The qualification was created in July 2005; SECNAVINST 1412.10 outlines the requirements for qualification.

==Chaplain==
Chaplains do not bear arms; therefore, they are designated as Fleet Marine Force Qualified Officers vice Fleet Marine Force Warfare Officers, and are waived from completing certain [weapons related] portions of the Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS). The Chaplain version of this badge does not include the crossed rifles and has a gold anodized finish.

==Navy Fleet Marine Force Ribbon==
As a result of the Fleet Marine Force Qualified Officer and Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist programs, the Navy Fleet Marine Force Ribbon was replaced effective October 1, 2006.

Those individuals who previously qualified for the Navy Fleet Marine Force Ribbon will retain the FMF designator; however, they are not entitled to wear the EFMFWS insignia until completing another FMF assignment and meeting all requirements outlined in OPNAVINST 1414.4B.

<doc id="850047" wikidata="Q423467" url="?curid=850047" title="Atazanavir">
<text>Atazanavir, sold under the brand name Reyataz among others, is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure (postexposure prophylaxis (PEP)). It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include headache, nausea, yellowish skin, abdominal pain, trouble sleeping, and fever. Severe side effects include rashes such as erythema multiforme and high blood sugar. Atazanavir appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. It is of the protease inhibitor (PI) class and works by blocking HIV protease.
Atazanavir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Atazanavir is used in the treatment of HIV. The efficacy of atazanavir has been assessed in a number of well-designed trials in ART-naive and ART-experienced adults.

Atazanavir is distinguished from other protease inhibitors in that it has lesser effects on lipid profile and appears to be less likely to cause lipodystrophy. There may be some cross-resistant with other protease inhibitors. When boosted with ritonavir it is equivalent in potency to lopinavir for use in &quot;salvage&quot; therapy in people with a degree of drug resistance, although boosting with ritonavir reduces the metabolic advantages of atazanavir.

=== Pregnancy ===
No evidence of harm has been found among pregnant women taking atazanavir. It is one of the preferred HIV medications to use in pregnant women who have not taken an HIV medication before. It was not associated with any birth defects among over 2,500 live births observed. Atazanavir resulted in a better cholesterol profile and confirmed that it is a safe option during pregnancy.

==Contraindications==
Atazanavir is contraindicated in those with previous hypersensitivity (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions). Additionally, atazanavir should not be given with alfuzosin, rifampin, irinotecan, lurasidone, pimozide, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, ergot derivatives, cisapride, St. John&#x27;s wort, lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, indinavir, or nevirapine.

Atazanavir inhibits the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, thereby impacting the hepatic glucuronidation and elimination of bilirubin. As such atazanavir may not be prescribed to patients with UGT1A1 deficiencies (e.g. those who suffer from Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome or Crigler–Najjar syndrome) in order to avoid the possibility of jaundice.

== Adverse effects ==
Common side effects include: nausea, jaundice, rash, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, insomnia, peripheral neurologic symptoms, dizziness, muscle pain, diarrhea, depression and fever. Bilirubin levels in the blood are normally asymptomatically raised with atazanavir, but can sometimes lead to jaundice.

== Mechanism of action ==
Atazanavir binds to the active site HIV protease and prevents it from cleaving the pro-form of viral proteins into the working machinery of the virus. If the HIV protease enzyme does not work, the virus is not infectious, and no mature virions are made.
The azapeptide drug was designed as an analog of the peptide chain substrate that HIV protease would cleave normally into active viral proteins. More specifically, atazanavir is a structural analog of the transition state during which the bond between a phenylalanine and proline is broken. Humans do not have any enzymes that break bonds between phenylalanine and proline, so this drug will not target human enzymes.

<text>Gas lighting is the production of artificial light from combustion of a fuel gas such as methane, propane, butane, acetylene, ethylene, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, coal gas (town gas) or natural gas. The light is produced either directly by the flame, generally by using special mixes (typically propane or butane) of illuminating gas to increase brightness, or indirectly with other components such as the gas mantle or the limelight, with the gas primarily functioning to heat the mantle or the lime to incandescence.

Before electricity became sufficiently widespread and economical to allow for general public use, gas lighting was prevalent for outdoor and indoor use in cities and suburbs where the infrastructure for distribution of gas was practical. At that time, the most common fuels for gas lighting were wood gas, coal gas and, in limited cases, water gas. Early gas lights were ignited manually by lamplighters, although many later designs are self-igniting.

Gas lighting now is frequently used for camping, for which the high energy density of the hydrocarbon fuel, and the modular canisters on which camping lights are built, brings bright and long lasting light without complex equipment. In addition, some urban historical districts retain gas street lighting, and gas lighting is used indoors or outdoors to create or preserve a nostalgic effect.

==History of gas lighting==
===Background===
Prior to use of gaseous fuels for lighting, the early lighting fuels consisted of olive oil, beeswax, fish oil, whale oil, sesame oil, nut oil, or other similar substances, which were all liquid fuels. These were the most commonly used fuels until the late 18th century. Whale oil was especially widely used for lighting in European cities such as London through the early 19th century.

Chinese records dating back 1,700 years indicate the use of natural gas in homes for lighting and heating. The natural gas was transported by means of bamboo pipes to homes. The ancient Chinese of the Spring and Autumn period made the first practical use of natural gas for lighting purposes around 500 B.C. in which they used bamboo pipelines to transport both brine and natural gas for many miles, such as the ones in Zigong salt mines.

Public illumination preceded by centuries the development and widespread adoption of gas lighting. In 1417, Sir Henry Barton, Lord Mayor of London, ordained &quot;Lanthornes with lights to bee hanged out on the Winter evening betwixt Hallowtide and Candlemassee.&quot; Paris was first illuminated by an order issued in 1524, and, in the beginning of the 16th century, the inhabitants were ordered to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced streets. In 1668, when some regulations were made for improving the streets of London, the residents were reminded to hang out their lanterns at the usual time, and, in 1690, an order was issued to hang out a light, or lamp, every night at nightfall, from Michaelmas to Christmas. By an Act of the Common Council in 1716, all housekeepers, whose houses faced any street, lane, or passage, were required to hang out, every dark night, one or more lights, to burn from six to eleven o&#x27;clock, under the penalty of one shilling as a fine for failing to do so.

Accumulating and escaping gases were known originally among coal miners for their adverse effects rather than their useful characteristics. Coal miners described two types of gases, one called the &quot;choke damp&quot; and the other &quot;fire damp&quot;. In 1667, a paper detailing the effects of these gases was entitled, &quot;A Description of a Well and Earth in Lancashire taking Fire, by a Candle approaching to it. Imparted by Thomas Shirley, Esq an eye-witness.&quot;

British clergyman and scientist Stephen Hales experimented with the actual distillation of coal, thereby obtaining a flammable liquid. He reported his results in the first volume of his &quot;Vegetable Statics&quot;, published in 1726. From the distillation of &quot;one hundred and fifty-eight grains [10.2 g] of Newcastle coal, he stated that he obtained 180 cubic inches [2.9 L] of gas, which weighed 51 grains [3.3 g], being nearly one third of the whole.&quot; Hales&#x27;s results garnered attention decades later as the unique chemical properties of various gases became understood through the work of Joseph Black, Henry Cavendish, Alessandro Volta, and others.

A 1733 publication by Sir James Lowther in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; detailed some properties of coal gas, including its flammability. Lowther demonstrated the principal properties of coal gas to different members of the Royal Society. He showed that the gas retained its flammability after storage for some time. The demonstration did not result in identification of utility.

Minister and experimentalist John Clayton referred to coal gas as the &quot;spirit&quot; of coal. He discovered its flammability by an accident. The &quot;spirit&quot; he isolated from coal caught fire by coming in contact with a candle as it escaped from a fracture in one of his distillation vessels. He stored the coal gas in bladders, and at times he entertained his friends by demonstrating the flammability of the gas. Clayton published his findings in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;.

===Early technology===

It took nearly 200 years for gas to become accessible for commercial use. A Flemish alchemist, Jan Baptista van Helmont, was the first person to formally recognize gas as a state of matter. He would go on to identify several types of gases, including carbon dioxide. Over one hundred years later in 1733, Sir James Lowther had some of his miners working on a water pit for his mine. While digging the pit they hit a pocket of gas. Lowther took a sample of the gas and took it home to do some experiments. He noted, &quot;The said air being put into a bladder … and tied close, may be carried away, and kept some days, and being afterwards pressed gently through a small pipe into the flame of a candle, will take fire, and burn at the end of the pipe as long as the bladder is gently pressed to feed the flame, and when taken from the candle after it is so lighted, it will continue burning till there is no more air left in the bladder to supply the flame.&quot; Lowther had basically discovered the principle behind gas lighting.

Later in the 18th century William Murdoch (sometimes spelled &quot;Murdock&quot;) stated: &quot;the gas obtained by distillation from coal, peat, wood and other inflammable substances burnt with great brilliancy upon being set fire to … by conducting it through tubes, it might be employed as an economical substitute for lamps and candles.&quot; Murdoch&#x27;s first invention was a lantern with a gas-filled bladder attached to a jet. He would use this to walk home at night. After seeing how well this worked he decided to light his home with gas. In 1797, Murdoch installed gas lighting in his new home as well as the workshop in which he worked. “This work was of a large scale, and he next experimented to find better ways of producing, purifying, and burning the gas.” The foundation had been laid for companies to start producing gas and other inventors to start playing with ways of using the new technology.

Murdoch was the first to exploit the flammability of gas for the practical application of lighting. He worked for Matthew Boulton and James Watt at their Soho Foundry steam engine works in Birmingham, England. In the early 1790s, while overseeing the use of his company&#x27;s steam engines in tin mining in Cornwall, Murdoch began experimenting with various types of gas, finally settling on coal gas as the most effective. He first lit his own house in Redruth, Cornwall in 1792. In 1798, he used gas to light the main building of the Soho Foundry and in 1802 lit the outside in a public display of gas lighting, the lights astonishing the local population. One of the employees at the Soho Foundry, Samuel Clegg, saw the potential of this new form of lighting. Clegg left his job to set up his own gas lighting business, the Gas Light and Coke Company.

A &quot;thermolampe&quot; using gas distilled from wood was patented in 1799, while German inventor Friedrich Winzer (Frederick Albert Winsor) was the first person to patent coal-gas lighting in 1804.

In 1801, Phillipe Lebon of Paris had also used gas lights to illuminate his house and gardens, and was considering how to light all of Paris. In 1820, Paris adopted gas street lighting.

In 1804, Dr Henry delivered a course of lectures on chemistry, at Manchester, in which he showed the mode of producing gas from coal, and the facility and advantage of its use. Dr Henry analysed the composition and investigated the properties of carburetted hydrogen gas (i.e. methane). His experiments were numerous and accurate and made upon a variety of substances; having obtained the gas from wood, peat, different kinds of coal, oil, wax, etc., he quantified the intensity of the light from each source.

In 1806 The Philips and Lee factory and a portion of Chapel Street in Salford, Lancashire were lit by gas, thought to be the first use of gas street lighting in the world.

Josiah Pemberton, an inventor, had for some time been experimenting on the nature of gas. A resident of Birmingham, his attention may have been roused by the exhibition at Soho. About 1806, he exhibited gas lights in a variety of forms and with great brilliance at the front of his factory in Birmingham. In 1808 he constructed an apparatus, applicable for several uses, for Benjamin Cooke, a manufacturer of brass tubes, gilt toys, and other articles.

In 1808, Murdoch presented to the Royal Society a paper entitled &quot;Account of the Application of Gas from Coal to Economical Purposes&quot; in which he described his successful application of coal gas to light the extensive establishment of Messrs. Phillips and Lea. For this paper he was awarded Count Rumford&#x27;s gold medal. Murdoch&#x27;s statements threw great light on the comparative advantage of gas and candles, and contained much useful information on the expenses of production and management.

Although the history is uncertain, David Melville has been credited with the first house and street lighting in the United States, in either 1805 or 1806 in Newport, Rhode Island.

In 1809, accordingly, the first application was made to Parliament to incorporate a company in order to accelerate the process, but the bill failed to pass. In 1810, however, the application was renewed by the same parties, and though some opposition was encountered and considerable expense incurred, the bill passed, but not without great alterations; and the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company was established. Less than two years later, on 31 December 1813, Westminster Bridge was lit by gas.

By 1816, Samuel Clegg obtained the patent for his horizontal rotative retort, his apparatus for purifying coal gas with cream of lime, and for his rotative gas meter and self-acting governor.

===Widespread use===

Among the economic impacts of gas lighting was much longer work hours in factories. This was particularly important in Great Britain during the winter months when nights are significantly longer. Factories could even work continuously over 24 hours, resulting in increased production. Following successful commercialization, gas lighting spread to other countries.

In England, the first place outside London to have gas lighting was Preston, Lancashire, in 1816; this was due to the Preston Gaslight Company run by revolutionary Joseph Dunn, who found the most improved way of brighter gas lighting. The parish church there was the first religious building to be lit by gas lighting. 

In Bristol, a Gas Light Company was founded on 15 December 1815. Under the supervision of the engineer, John Brelliat, extensive works were conducted in 1816-17 to build a gasholder, mains and street lights. Many of the principal streets in the centre of the city, as well as nearby houses, had switched to gas lighting by the end of 1817. 

In America, Seth Bemis lit his factory with gas illumination from 1812 to 1813. The use of gas lights in Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s Museum in Baltimore in 1816 was a great success. Baltimore was the first American city with gas street lights; Peale&#x27;s Gas Light Company of Baltimore on 7 February 1817 lit its first street lamp at Market and Lemon Streets (currently Baltimore and Holliday Streets). The first private residence in the US illuminated by gas has been variously identified as that of David Melville (c. 1806), as described above, or of William Henry, a coppersmith, at 200 Lombard Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1816.

In 1817, at the three stations of the Chartered Gas Company in London, 25 chaldrons (24 m3) of coal were carbonized daily, producing 300,000 cubic feet (8,500 m3) of gas. This supplied gas lamps equal to 75,000 Argand lamps each yielding the light of six candles. At the City Gas Works, in Dorset Street, Blackfriars, three chaldrons of coal were carbonized each day, providing the gas equivalent of 9,000 Argand lamps. So 28 chaldrons of coal were carbonized daily, and 84,000 lights supplied by those two companies only.

At this period the principal difficulty in gas manufacture was purification. Mr. D. Wilson, of Dublin, patented a method for purifying coal gas by means of the chemical action of ammoniacal gas. Another plan was devised by Reuben Phillips, of Exeter, who patented the purification of coal gas by the use of dry lime. G. Holworthy, in 1818, patented a method of purifying it by passing the gas, in a highly condensed state, through iron retorts heated to a dark red.

In 1820, Swedish inventor Johan Patrik Ljungström had developed a gas lighting with copper apparatuses and chandeliers of ink, brass and crystal, reportedly one of the first such public installations of gas lighting in the region, enhanced as a triumphal arch for the city gate for a royal visit of Charles XIV John of Sweden in 1820.

By 1823, numerous towns and cities throughout Britain were lit by gas. Gas light cost up to 75% less than oil lamps or candles, which helped to accelerate its development and deployment. By 1859, gas lighting was to be found all over Britain and about a thousand gas works had sprung up to meet the demand for the new fuel. The brighter lighting which gas provided allowed people to read more easily and for longer. This helped to stimulate literacy and learning, speeding up the second Industrial Revolution.

In 1824 the English Association for Gas Lighting on the Continent, a sizeable business producing gas for several cities in mainland, Europe, including Berlin, was established, with Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet as general manager.

The 1839 invention, the Bude-Light, provided a brighter and more economical lamp.

Oil-gas appeared in the field as a rival of coal gas. In 1815, John Taylor patented an apparatus for the decomposition of &quot;oil&quot; and other animal substances. Public attention was attracted to &quot;oil-gas&quot; by the display of the patent apparatus at Apothecary&#x27;s Hall, by Taylor &amp; Martineau.

In 1891 the gas mantle was invented by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. This eliminated the need for special illuminating gas (a synthetic mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases produced by destructive distillation of bituminous coal or peat) to get bright shining flames. Acetylene was also used from about 1898 for gas lighting on a smaller scale.

Illuminating gas was used for gas lighting, as it produces a much brighter light than natural gas or water gas. Illuminating gas was much less toxic than other forms of coal gas, but less could be produced from a given quantity of coal. The experiments with distilling coal were described by John Clayton in 1684. George Dixon&#x27;s pilot plant exploded in 1760, setting back the production of illuminating gas a few years. The first commercial application was in a Manchester cotton mill in 1806. In 1901, studies of the defoliant effect of leaking gas pipes led to the discovery that ethylene is a plant hormone.

Throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th, the gas was manufactured by the gasification of coal. Later in the 19th century, natural gas began to replace coal gas, first in the US, and then in other parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, coal gas was used until the early 1970s.

====Russia====
The history of the Russian gas industry began with retired Lieutenant Pyotr Sobolevsky (1782–1841), who improved Philippe le Bon&#x27;s design for a &quot;thermolamp&quot; and presented it to Emperor Alexander I in 1811; in January 1812, Sobolevsky was instructed to draw up a plan for gas street-lighting for St. Petersburg. The French invasion of Russia delayed implementation, but St. Petersburg&#x27;s Governor General Mikhail Miloradovich, who had seen the gas lighting of Vienna, Paris and other European cities, initiated experimental work on gas lighting for the capital, using British apparatus for obtaining gas from pit coal, and by the autumn of 1819, Russia&#x27;s first gas street light was lit on one of the streets on Aptekarsky Island.

In February 1835, the Company for Gas Lighting St. Petersburg was founded; towards the end of that year, a factory for the production of lighting gas was constructed near the Obvodny Canal, using pit coal brought in by ship from Cardiff; and 204 gas lamps were ceremonially lit in St. Petersburg on 27 September 1839.

Over the next 10 years, their numbers almost quadrupled, to reach 800. By the middle of the 19th century, the central streets and buildings of the capital were illuminated: the Palace Square, Bolshaya and Malaya Morskaya streets, Nevsky and Tsarskoselsky Avenues, Passage Arcade, Noblemen&#x27;s Assembly, the Technical Institute and Peter and Paul Fortress.

=== Theatrical use ===
It took many years of development and testing before gas lighting for the stage was commercially available. Gas technology was then installed in just about every major theatre in the world. But gas lighting was short-lived because the electric light bulb soon followed.

In the 19th century, gas stage lighting went from a crude experiment to the most popular way of lighting theatrical stages. In 1804, Frederick Albert Winsor first demonstrated the way to use gas to light the stage in London at the Lyceum Theatre. Although the demonstration and all the lead research were being done in London, &quot;in 1816 at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia was the earliest gas lit theatre in world&quot;. In 1817 the Lyceum, Drury Lane, and Covent Garden theatres were all lit by gas. Gas was brought into the building by &quot;miles of rubber tubing from outlets in the floor called &#x27;water joints&#x27;&quot; which &quot;carried the gas to border-lights and wing lights&quot;. But before it was distributed, the gas came through a central distribution point called a &quot;gas table&quot;, which varied the brightness by regulating the gas supply, and the gas table, which allowed control of separate parts of the stage. Thus it became the first stage &#x27;switchboard&#x27;.

By the 1850s, gas lighting in theatres had spread practically all over the United States and Europe. Some of the largest installations of gas lighting were in large auditoriums, like the Théâtre du Chatelet, built in 1862. In 1875, the new Paris Opera was constructed. &quot;Its lighting system contained more than twenty-eight miles [] of gas piping, and its gas table had no fewer than eighty-eight stopcocks, which controlled nine hundred and sixty gas jets.&quot; The theatre that used the most gas lighting was Astley&#x27;s Equestrian Amphitheatre in London. According to the Illustrated London News, &quot;Everywhere white and gold meets the eye, and about 200,000 gas jets add to the glittering effect of the auditorium … such a blaze of light and splendour has scarcely ever been witnessed, even in dreams.&quot;

Theatres switched to gas lighting because it was more economical than using candles and also required less labour to operate. With gas lighting, theatres would no longer need to have people tending to candles during a performance, or having to light each candle individually. &quot;It was easier to light a row of gas jets than a greater quantity of candles high in the air.&quot; Theatres also no longer needed to worry about wax dripping on the actors during a show.

Gas lighting also had an effect on the actors. As the stage was brighter, they could now use less make-up and their motions did not have to be as exaggerated. Half-lit stages had become fully lit stages. Production companies were so impressed with the new technology that one said, &quot;This light is perfect for the stage. One can obtain gradation of brightness that is really magical.&quot;

The best result was the improved respect from the audience. There was no more shouting or riots. The light pushed the actors more up stage behind the proscenium, helping the audience concentrate more on the action that was taking place on stage rather than what was going on in the house. Management had more authority on what went on during the show because they could see. Gaslight was the leading cause of behaviour change in theatres. They were no longer places for mingling and orange selling, but places of respected entertainment.

====Types of lighting instruments====
There were six types of burners, but four burners were really experimented with:
* The first burner used was the single-jet burner, which produced a small flame. The tip of the burner was made out of lead, which absorbed heat, causing the flame to be smaller in size. It was discovered that the flame would burn brighter if the metal was mixed with other components, such as porcelain.
* Flat burners were invented mainly to distribute gas and light evenly to the systems.
* The fishtail burner was similar to the flat burner, but it produced a brighter flame and conducted less heat.
* The last burner that was experimented with was the Welsbach burner. Around this time the Bunsen burner was in use along with some forms of electricity. The Welsbach was based on the idea of the Bunsen burner, still using gas. A cotton mesh with cerium and thorium was imbedded into the Welsbach. This source of light was named the gas mantle; it produced three times more light than the naked flame.

Several different instruments were used for stage lighting in the 19th century fell; these included footlights, border lights, groundrows, lengths, bunch lights, conical reflector floods, and limelight spots. These mechanisms sat directly on the stage, blinding the eyes of the audience.

* Footlights caused the actors&#x27; costumes to catch fire if they got too close. These lights also caused bothersome heat that affected both audience members and actors. Again, the actors had to adapt to these changes. They started fireproofing their costumes and placing wire mesh in front of the footlights.
* Border lights, also known as striplights, were a row of lights that hung horizontally in the flies. Color was added later by dying cotton, wool, and silk cloth.
* Lengths were constructed the same way as border lights, but mounted vertically in the rear where the wings were.
* Bunch lights were a cluster of burners that sat on a vertical base that was fuelled directly from the gas line.
* The conical reflector can be related to the Fresnel lens used today. This adjustable box of light reflected a beam whose size could be altered by a barndoor.
* Limelight spots are similar to today&#x27;s current spotlighting system. This instrument was used in scene shops, as well as the stage.

Gas lighting did have some disadvantages. &quot;Several hundred theatres are said to have burned down in America and Europe between 1800 and the introduction of electricity in the late 1800s. The increased heat was objectionable, and the border lights and wing lights had to be lighted by a long stick with a flaming wad of cotton at the end. For many years, an attendant or gas boy moved along the long row of jets, lighting them individually while gas was escaping from the whole row. Both actors and audiences complained of the escaping gas, and explosions sometimes resulted from its accumulation.&quot;

These problems with gas lighting led to the rapid adoption of electric lighting. By 1881, the Savoy Theatre in London was using incandescent lighting. While electric lighting was introduced to theatre stages, the gas mantle was developed in 1885 for gas-lit theatres. &quot;This was a beehive-shaped mesh of knitted thread impregnated with lime that, in miniature, converted the naked gas flame into in effect, a lime-light.&quot; Electric lighting slowly took over in theatres. In the 20th century, it enabled better and safer theatre productions, with no smell, relatively very little heat, and more freedom for designers.

=== Decline ===
In the early 20th century, most cities in North America and Europe had gaslit streets, and most railway station platforms had gas lights too. However, around 1880 gas lighting for streets and train stations began giving way to high voltage (3,000–6,000 volt) direct current and alternating current arc lighting systems. This time period also saw the development of the first electric power utility designed for indoor use. The new system by inventor Thomas Edison was designed to function similar to gas lighting. For reasons of safety and simplicity it used direct current (DC) at a relatively low 110 volts to light incandescent light bulbs. Voltage in wires steadily declines as distance increases, and at this low voltage power plants needed to be within about of the lamps. This voltage drop problem made DC distribution relatively expensive and gas lighting retained widespread usage with new buildings sometimes constructed with dual systems of gas piping and electrical wiring connected to each room, to diversify the power sources for lighting.

The development of new alternating current power transmission systems in the 1880s and 90s by companies such as Ganz and AEG in Europe and Westinghouse Electric and Thomson-Houston in the US solved the voltage and distance problem by using high transmission line voltages, and transformers to drop the voltage for distribution for indoor lighting. Alternating current technology overcame many of the limitations of direct current, enabling the rapid growth of reliable, low-cost electrical power networks which finally spelled the end of widespread usage of gas lighting.

==Modern usage==

===Outdoors===

In some cities, gas lighting is preserved or restored as a vintage nostalgic feature to support the historic atmosphere of their historic centres.

In the 20th century, most cities with gas streetlights replaced them with new electric streetlights. For example, Baltimore, the first US city to install gas streetlights, removed nearly all of them. A sole, token gas lamp is located at N. Holliday Street and E. Baltimore Street as a monument to the first gas lamp in America, erected at that location.

However, gas lighting of streets has not disappeared completely from some cities, and the few municipalities that retained gas lighting now find that it provides a pleasing nostalgic effect. Gas lighting is also seeing a resurgence in the luxury home market for those in search of historical authenticity.

The largest gas lighting network in the world is that of Berlin. With about 23,000 lamps (2022), it holds more than half of all working gas street lamps in the world, followed by Düsseldorf with 14,000 lamps (2020), of which at least 10,000 are to be retained. 

In London there were about 1,500 working gas street lamps although there were plans to replace 299 of those in Westminster (the first city in the world lit by gas) with LED lighting by 2023, which sparked public opposition.

In the United States, more than 2800 gas lights in Boston operate in the historic districts of Beacon Hill, Back Bay, Bay Village, Charlestown, and parts of other neighbourhoods. In Cincinnati, Ohio, more than 1100 gas lights operate in areas that have been named historic districts. Gas lights also operate in parts of the famed French Quarter and outside historic homes throughout the city in New Orleans.

Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, has used gas candelabras since 1863. Initially, Zagreb was illuminated by 60,000 lamps, but only 248 gas street lamps illuminate old parts of the city. Zagreb gas lamps are manually managed by lamplighters.

Prague, where gas lighting was introduced on 15 September 1847, had about 10,000 gas streetlamps in the 1940s. The last historic gas candelabras become electrified in 1985. However, in 2002–2014, streetlamps along the Royal Route and some other streets in the centre were rebuilt to use gas (using replicas of the historic poles and lanterns), several historic candelabras (Hradčanské náměstí, Loretánská street, Dražického náměstí etc.) were also converted back to gas lamps, and five new gas lamps were installed in the Michle Gasworks as a promotion. In 2018, there were 417 points (about 650 lanterns) of street gas lighting in Prague. During Advent and Christmas, lanterns on the Charles Bridge are managed manually by a lamplighter in historic uniform. The plan to reintroduce gas lights in Old Prague was proposed in 2002, and adopted by the Municipality of Prague in January 2004.

=== Indoors ===


The use of natural gas (methane) for &quot;indoor&quot; lighting is nearly extinct. Besides producing a lot of heat, the combustion of methane tends to release significant amounts of carbon monoxide, a colourless and odourless gas that is more readily absorbed by the blood than oxygen, and can be deadly. Historically, the use of lamps of all types was of shorter duration than we are accustomed to with electric lights, and in the far more draughty buildings, it was of less concern and danger. There are suppliers of new mantle gas lamps set up for use with natural gas; and, some old homes still have fixtures installed, and some period restorations have salvaged fixtures installed, more for decoration than use.

New fixtures are still made and available for propane (sometimes called &quot;bottle(d) gas&quot;), a product of oil refining, which under most circumstances burns more completely to carbon dioxide and water vapour. In some locations where public utility electricity or kerosene are not readily accessible or desirable, propane gas mantle lamps are still used, although the increased availability of alternative energy sources, such as solar panels and small scale wind turbines, combined with increasing efficiency of lighting products, such as compact fluorescent lamps and LEDs are also in use.

=== Other uses ===
Perforated tubes bent into the shape of letters were used to form gas lit advertising signs, prior to the introduction of neon lights, as early as 1857 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Gas lighting is still in common use for camping lights. Small portable gas lamps, connected to a portable gas cylinder, are a common item on camping trips. Mantle lamps powered by vaporized petrol, such as the Coleman lantern, are also available.

<doc id="850049" wikidata="Q5606852" url="?curid=850049" title="Gregory Charles Rivers">
<text>Gregory Charles Rivers (April 19652 February 2024), also known by his Chinese name Ho Kwok-wing (), was an Australian–Hong Kong actor. He was known for his roles in various TVB series, and was dubbed &quot;TVB&#x27;s token &quot;gweilo&quot;&quot; (white person) for his frequent appearances as stereotypical Caucasian characters.

== Early life and education ==
Rivers was born in Gympie, Queensland, in April 1965. He attended medical school at the University of New South Wales, where he became friends with students from Hong Kong who introduced him to Cantopop. He began teaching himself Cantonese by listening to Cantopop cassette tapes while reading the printed lyrics and looking up Chinese words in a dictionary.

Rivers chauffeured Cantopop singers Leslie Cheung and Alan Tam when they held concerts in Sydney during the 1980s. After dropping out from school in 1987, he moved to Hong Kong. Two weeks after he landed, he ran into some of Tam&#x27;s band members and was invited to sing with him.

== Career ==
As a debutant with a modicum of Cantonese, Rivers auditioned and was chosen for a Caucasian role at Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB). Rivers adopted the Chinese name Ho Kwok-wing, the surname Ho meaning &quot;river&quot; and the given name Kwok-wing after his idol Leslie Cheung. He went on to become &quot;TVB&#x27;s token &quot;gweilo&quot;&quot; (white person) for two decades.

In 2005, Rivers appeared on stage in an opera production playing the role of Teresa Teng&#x27;s boyfriend.

In October 2007, Rivers was one of four non-Chinese TV actors featured in an in-depth interview and feature story titled &quot;Hello Neighbour&quot; in &quot;Muse&quot;, discussing his sense of cultural identity and how he viewed his work.

Rivers quipped that he was &quot;TVB&#x27;s token Caucasian for 20 years straight&quot;, having played many stereotyped roles in more than 300 dramas for TVB. Rivers&#x27; contract with TVB ended in 2007.

Rivers also worked as an English dialogue coach for Hong Kong and Chinese actors, notably Chow Yun-fat in &quot;Dragonball Evolution&quot; (2009).

In January 2016, Rivers was awarded &quot;Best Hong Kong male singer&quot; at the satirical &quot;TVMost 1st Guy Ten Big Ging Cook Gum Cook Awards Distribution&quot; (), a parody of TVB&#x27;s Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation. The award was given for his song &quot;Forever ATV&quot; (), which made fun of the apparent government support for Asia Television despite its expiring broadcasting licence. In addition to &quot;Forever ATV&quot;, Rivers also performed a parody of &quot;Hong Kong Place&quot; () at the ceremony, a Cantonese rap song about his love for the city.

== Personal life and death ==
Rivers married actress Bonnie Cheung in March 1989.

In 2017, Gregory was diagnosed with skin cancer after finding a swelling on the right side of his ear. He underwent surgery and remained cancer-free thereafter. In 2018, he was diagnosed with arrhythmia. His heart condition was so serious that he had to undergo two rounds of surgery, accumulating a debt of .

Rivers was found dead in his home in Tai Au Mun village on 2 February 2024 at the age of 58, in an apparent charcoal-burning suicide. His wife had died of illness a few months prior.

<text>The Home Rule League (1873–1882), sometimes called the Home Rule Party, was an Irish political party which campaigned for home rule for Ireland within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, until it was replaced by the Irish Parliamentary Party. The Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain was a sister organisation in Great Britain.

==Origins==

Following the failure of the Fenian Rising of 1867 less revolutionary tactics were considered. The Home Rule League grew out of the Home Government Association, a pressure group formed in 1870 and led by Isaac Butt, a Dublin-based barrister who had once been a leading Irish Tory before becoming a convert to Irish nationalism. On 18–21 November 1873, the loose association re-constituted itself as a full political party, the Home Rule League, and in the 1874 general election, many of whom were from an Irish aristocratic or gentry Church of Ireland background, some newly dedicated former Irish Liberal Party members, such as Sir John Gray MP, and other more radical members who gathered around Cavan MP Joseph Biggar and Meath MP Charles Stewart Parnell. This radical wing of the party launched parliamentary filibusters to obstruct the passage of Parliamentary business, to the embarrassment of Butt and frustration of successive British governments.

==Changes under Parnell==
On 28 August 1877 Parnell was elected leader of the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain in place of Butt. In January 1878, Butt retained control of the Home Rule League in Ireland, which had a more middle-class and less Fenian membership and structure. The division affected the disciple of the parliamentary party at Westminster.

Following Butt&#x27;s death in 1879, William Shaw served as chairman (leader) for one parliamentary session. In 1880, Parnell was elected chairman of the party, and in the 1880 general election, the party increased its number of seats. In 1882, as part of a wholesale move from being an informal alliance to a cohesive unified, political movement Parnell renamed it the Irish Parliamentary Party to pursue Irish Home Rule. The party under Parnell, himself a Protestant, became more radical, middle class, and Catholic. It largely, though not completely, squeezed out other political rivals, notably the Irish Liberal Party and the Irish Conservative Party.

<text>Boo.com was a short-lived British eCommerce business, founded in 1998 by Swedes Ernst Malmsten, Kajsa Leander and Patrik Hedelin, who were regarded as sophisticated Internet entrepreneurs in Europe by the investors because they had created an online bookstore named Bokus.com, the third largest book e-retailer (in 1997), before founding boo.com.

After several highly publicized delays, Boo.com launched in the autumn of 1999 selling branded fashion apparel over the Internet. The company spent $135 million of venture capital in just 18 months, and it was placed into receivership on 18 May 2000 and liquidated.

In June 2008, CNET hailed Boo.com as one of the greatest dot-com busts in history.

Ernst Malmsten wrote about the experience in a book called &quot;Boo Hoo: A dot.com Story from Concept to Catastrophe&quot;, published in 2001.

== Marketing plan ==

=== Company vision ===

Boo.com was intended to become the largest online sports e-retailer in the world, planning to set up stores in both Europe and America simultaneously.

=== Brand name ===

The brand name was initially suggested as Bo.com, which was inspired by the actress Bo Derek. The final domain name, Boo.com, was bought for $2500 from a dealer as the domain Bo.com was already in use.

=== Strategy ===

The target customers of Boo.com were young, wealthy and fashionable people between 18 and 24 years old, who were expected to be attracted by sports and fashion brands offered by Boo.com. Boo.com created a virtual shopping assistant, Miss Boo, to assist customers with tips given at each step. Boo.com also developed technology that allowed online customers to put their chosen products onto 3D models and then inspect the result.

== Headquarters and relaunch ==
The company had its headquarters along Carnaby Street in London. The company initially had 40 employees. In October 1999, it had a total of eight offices and 400 employees in Amsterdam, Munich, New York City, Paris, and Stockholm. It relaunched in the autumn of 2000 with Kate Buggeln, an ex-Bloomingdale&#x27;s salesperson and Internet consultant, appointed as president. She told &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; that they were working to &quot;expand beyond the portal business model into Boo products and Boo licensing.&quot;

== Reasons for failure ==

=== Timing ===
Although there were several months of delays prior to launch and problems with the user experience when boo.com first launched, these had been largely fixed by the time the company entered receivership. Sales had grown rapidly and were around $500,000 for the fortnight prior to the site being shut down.

The fundamental problem was that the company was following an extremely aggressive growth plan, launching simultaneously in multiple European countries. This plan was founded on the assumption of the ready availability of venture capital money to see the company through the first few years of trading until sales caught up with operating expenses. Such capital ceased to be available for all practical purposes in the second quarter of 2000 following dramatic falls in the NASDAQ presaging the &quot;dot crash&quot; following the dot-com bubble. Boo was one of numerous similar dot-com company failures over the subsequent two years.

One Boo.com manager acknowledges that the company&#x27;s failure was that global marketing and advertising costs too much, and that managers and technology invest too little. It spent $135 million of its investment in 2 years.

=== Problems with users experience ===

The boo.com website was widely criticized as poorly designed for its target audience, going against many usability conventions. The site relied heavily on JavaScript and Flash technology to display pseudo-3D views of wares as well as Miss Boo, a sales-assistant-style avatar. The first publicly released version of the site included many large pages; the home page, for example, was several hundred kilobytes which meant that many users had to wait minutes for the site to load, as broadband technologies were not widely available at the time. The site&#x27;s front page contained the warning, &quot;this site is designed for 56K modems and above&quot;.

The complicated design required the site to be displayed in a fixed-size window, which limited the space available to display product information to the customer. Navigation techniques changed as the customer moved around the site.

The site&#x27;s interface was complex and included a hierarchical system that required the user to answer four or five different questions before sometimes revealing that there were no products in stock in a particular sub-section. The same basic questions then had to be answered again until results were found.

=== Excessive expenditure on marketing ===

Within 18 months, $135 million was spent on marketing by Boo.com. Boo.com spent $25 million on advertising and public relations marketing before it had even opened to sell products.

To attract consumers, the site developed a new Internet virtual technology with which consumers could drag their intended clothes onto a virtual 3D body model, and then view it from whatever angles and distance they wanted. The investment in this technology cost Boo.com over $6 million to develop and $0.5 million every month to maintain.

== Burn rate ==
Boo.com spent £125 million in just six months. Boo.com&#x27;s sales did not match expectations, due partly to a higher-than-expected rate of product returns (a service that was offered for free, but charged for by their logistics supplier Deutsche Post). Poor management and a lack of communication between departments resulted in rapid growth in costs. The effectiveness of an expensive ad campaign was limited since the website was not ready in time, resulting in curious visitors being greeted with a holding page.

Staff and contractors were recruited in large numbers, with a lack of direction and executive decision about how many people were required, resulting in high payroll costs.

== Aftermath ==

The biggest loser among boo.com&#x27;s investors was Omnia, a fund backed by members of Lebanon&#x27;s wealthy Hariri family, which put nearly £20 million into the company.

Creditors, most of whom were advertising agencies, were owed around £12 million. Over 400 staff and contractors were made redundant in London and around the world, and many had not been paid for several months.

In a widely circulated article, former Interim CTO Tristan Louis broke down the problems that plagued the company, in one of the first post-mortems of a technology company posted online.

Fashionmall.com, which had been operating since 1994, bought the remains of Boo.com, which included brand, web address and advertising materials but did not include any physical assets, software or distribution channels. The deal also included the Miss Boo character. Boo&#x27;s main assets, its software and technology, were sold to Bright Station, a British company run by Internet entrepreneur Dan Wagner, for $250,000 and served as the basis for Venda Inc. Wagner credited the technology he acquired as key to the success of Venda (and its eventual acquisition by NetSuite for US$50M in 2014).

Less than $2 million was earned by selling all Boo&#x27;s remaining assets.

Of the original global boo.com staff only one worked for both boo.com incarnations. Bill Burley of the original boo.com staff in New York City is a retail executive in buying and merchandise planning. Burley was hired by fashionmall as the Global Fashion Director of the new boo. He reported directly to Ms. Buggeln.

In 2005 CNET called Boo.com the sixth greatest dot-com flop.

== Current state of the domain ==
In May 2007 Web Reservations International (WRI) turned boo.com into a travel site with reviews and listings. When the new site launched, it already had more than one million user reviews which had been collected from existing WRI travel sites.

In October 2010, the new boo.com site announced that it was closing down with effect from 1 November 2010.

 boo.com redirects to hostelworld.com.

<text>Unknown (also known as Unknown Worlds) was an American pulp fantasy fiction magazine, published from 1939 to 1943 by Street &amp; Smith, and edited by John W. Campbell. &quot;Unknown&quot; was a companion to Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s science fiction pulp, &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, which was also edited by Campbell at the time; many authors and illustrators contributed to both magazines. The leading fantasy magazine in the 1930s was &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, which focused on shock and horror. Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy magazine with more finesse and humor than &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, and put his plans into action when Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;, about aliens who own the human race. &quot;Unknown&quot;″s first issue appeared in March 1939; in addition to &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;, it included H. L. Gold&#x27;s &quot;Trouble With Water&quot;, a humorous fantasy about a New Yorker who meets a water gnome. Gold&#x27;s story was the first of many in &quot;Unknown&quot; to combine commonplace reality with the fantastic.

Campbell required his authors to avoid simplistic horror fiction and insisted that the fantasy elements in a story be developed logically: for example, Jack Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Darker Than You Think&quot; describes a world in which there is a scientific explanation for the existence of werewolves. Similarly, L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt&#x27;s Harold Shea series, about a modern American who finds himself in the worlds of various mythologies, depicts a system of magic based on mathematical logic. Other notable works included several novels by L. Ron Hubbard and short stories such as Manly Wade Wellman&#x27;s &quot;When It Was Moonlight&quot; and Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Two Sought Adventure&quot;, the first in his Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series.

&quot;Unknown&quot; was forced to a bimonthly schedule in 1941 by poor sales and canceled in 1943 when wartime paper shortages became so acute that Campbell had to choose between turning &quot;Astounding&quot; into a bimonthly or ending &quot;Unknown&quot;. The magazine is generally regarded as the finest fantasy fiction magazine ever published, despite the fact that it was not commercially successful, and in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley it was responsible for the creation of the modern fantasy publishing genre.

==Background and publication history==
In May 1923, the first issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; appeared, from Rural Publications in Chicago. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was a pulp magazine that specialized in fantasy stories and material that no other magazine would accept. It was not initially successful, but by the 1930s had established itself and was regularly publishing science fiction (SF) as well as fantasy. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was the first magazine to focus solely on fantasy, and it remained the pre-eminent magazine in this field for over a decade. In the meantime, science fiction was starting to form a separately marketed genre, with the appearance in 1926 of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, a pulp magazine edited by Hugo Gernsback. In 1930 pulp publisher Clayton Publications launched &quot;Astounding Stories of Super Science&quot;, but the company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1933 led to the acquisition of the magazine by Street &amp; Smith. The title was shortened to &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, and it became the leading magazine in the science fiction field over the next few years under the editorship of F. Orlin Tremaine. At the end of 1937, John W. Campbell took over as editor.

By 1938, Campbell was planning a fantasy companion to &quot;Astounding&quot;: &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was still the leader in the fantasy genre, though competitors such as &quot;Strange Stories&quot; were also being launched. Campbell began acquiring stories suitable for the new magazine, without a definite launch date in mind. When Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;, Campbell decided it was time to put his plans into action. The first issue of &quot;Unknown&quot; appeared in March 1939. It was a monthly at first, but poor sales forced a switch to a bimonthly schedule beginning in February 1941. In December 1940, the subtitle &quot;Fantasy Fiction&quot; was added, and in October 1941, the main title was changed to &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot;; both changes were intended to make the genre of the magazine clearer to potential readers. When wartime paper shortages became severe in late 1943, Campbell chose to keep &quot;Astounding&quot; monthly and cancel &quot;Unknown&quot;, rather than switch the former to a bimonthly schedule as well. The last issue was dated October 1943.

==Contents and reception==

Campbell&#x27;s plans for &quot;Unknown&quot; were laid out in the February 1939 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot;, in the announcement of the new magazine. He argued that &quot;it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... [&quot;Unknown&quot;] will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term&quot;. The first issue, the following month, led with Russell&#x27;s &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;, the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by SF historian Mike Ashley as &quot;a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy&quot;. Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in &quot;Unknown&quot;; in Ashley&#x27;s words, Campbell &quot;brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy&quot;. The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold&#x27;s &quot;Trouble with Water&quot;, a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, &quot;Trouble with Water&quot; was a better indication than &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot; of the direction &quot;Unknown&quot; would take. Campbell commented in a letter at the time that &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;, &quot;Trouble with Water&quot;, and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.

Under Campbell&#x27;s editorial supervision, the fantasy element in &quot;Unknown&quot; stories had to be treated rigorously. This naturally led to the appearance in &quot;Unknown&quot; of writers already comfortable with similar rigor in science fiction stories, and Campbell soon established a small group of writers as regular contributors, many of whom were also appearing in the pages of &quot;Astounding&quot;. L. Ron Hubbard, Theodore Sturgeon, and L. Sprague de Camp were among the most prolific. Hubbard contributed eight lead novels including &quot;Typewriter in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Slaves of Sleep&quot;, and &quot;Fear&quot;, described by Ashley as a &quot;classic psychological thriller&quot;; SF historian and critic Thomas Clareson describes all eight as &quot;outstanding&quot;. De Camp, in collaboration with Fletcher Pratt, contributed three stories featuring Harold Shea, who finds himself in a world where magic operates by rigorous rules. The title of one of these, &quot;The Mathematics of Magic&quot;, is, according to SF critic John Clute, &quot;perfectly expressive of the terms under which magic found easy mention in &quot;Unknown&quot;&quot;.
Other &quot;Astounding&quot; writers who wrote for &quot;Unknown&quot; included Robert A. Heinlein, whose &quot;The Devil Makes the Law&quot; (reprinted as &quot;Magic, Inc.&quot;) depicts a world where magic is a part of everyday life. Heinlein also contributed &quot;The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag&quot; and &quot;They&quot;, described by Ashley as &quot;perhaps the ultimate solipsist fantasy&quot;. A.E. van Vogt, a frequent &quot;Astounding&quot; contributor, appeared in the final issue with &quot;The Book of Ptath&quot; (later expanded into a novel). Isaac Asimov, despite multiple attempts to write for &quot;Unknown&quot;, never appeared in the magazine. On his sixth attempt, he sold &quot;Author! Author!&quot; to Campbell, but the magazine was canceled before it could appear. It eventually appeared in the anthology &quot;The Unknown Five&quot;.

In addition to the overlap between the writers of &quot;Unknown&quot; and &quot;Astounding&quot;, there was a good deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. SF historian Paul Carter has argued that the spectrum of fantastic fiction from &quot;Weird Tales&quot; through &quot;Unknown&quot; to &quot;Astounding&quot; was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as &quot;Wonder Stories&quot; were more like the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.

Fritz Leiber&#x27;s first published story was &quot;Two Sought Adventure&quot;, which appeared in the August 1939 issue of &quot;Unknown&quot;; this was the first story in his long-running Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series about a pair of adventurers in a sword and sorcery setting. Four more Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories appeared in &quot;Unknown&quot; in as many years, and Leiber&#x27;s novel &quot;Conjure Wife&quot;, about a man who discovers that all women are secretly witches, was the lead story in the April 1943 issue. The protagonist, a university professor, &quot;is forced to abandon scepticism and discover the underlying equations of magic, via symbolic logic&quot;, in critic David Langford&#x27;s description. Leiber also contributed &quot;Smoke Ghost&quot; in October 1941, described by Ashley as &quot;arguably the first seriously modern ghost story&quot;. Another writer whose first story appeared in &quot;Unknown&quot; was James H. Schmitz, whose &quot;Greenface&quot; appeared in the August 1943 issue.

Other notable stories that appeared in &quot;Unknown&quot; include Jack Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Darker Than You Think&quot; (December 1940), which provides a scientific basis for a race of werewolves living undetected alongside human beings. Expanded into a novel in 1948, it remains Williamson&#x27;s best-known fantasy, and SF historian Malcolm Edwards comments that the two protagonists&#x27; relationship is &quot;depicted with a tortured (and still haunting) erotic frankness unusual in genre literature of the 1940s&quot;. In addition to the Harold Shea pieces, de Camp published several other well-received stories, including &quot;The Wheels of If&quot; (October 1940) and &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot; (December 1939), an alternate history story about a time-traveler who attempts to save the Roman Empire from the coming Dark Ages; Edwards and Clute comment that the story is &quot;the most accomplished early excursion into history in magazine SF, and is regarded as a classic&quot;. Also highly regarded is Wellman&#x27;s &quot;When It Was Moonlight&quot; (December 1940), a story about Poe.

The first sixteen issues of &quot;Unknown&quot; had cover paintings, but from July 1940 the cover style was changed to a table of contents, with a small ink drawing usually accompanying the summary of each story, in an attempt to make the magazine appear more dignified. The cover art came almost entirely from artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: six of the sixteen paintings were by H. W. Scott; Manuel Islip, Modest Stein, Graves Gladney, and Edd Cartier provided the others. Cartier was the only one of these who regularly contributed to SF and fantasy periodicals; he painted four of &quot;Unknown&quot;″s last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.

==Influence==

&quot;Unknown&quot; was, along with &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, an important early influence on the fantasy genre. In the foreword to &quot;From Unknown Worlds&quot;, in 1948, Campbell commented that fantasy before &quot;Unknown&quot; had been too much infused with &quot;gloom and terror&quot;; his approach in &quot;Unknown&quot; had been to assume that the &quot;creatures of mythology and folklore&quot; could be characters in an amusing tale as easily as they could be made part of a horror story. Horror stories, he said, had a place, but &quot;horror injected with a sharp and poisoned needle is just as effective as when applied with the blunt-instrument technique of the so-called Gothic horror tale&quot;. Campbell insisted on the same rational approach to fantasy that he required of his science fiction writers, and in the words of Clareson, this led to the destruction of &quot;not only the prevalent narrative tone but also most of the trappings that had dominated fantasy from &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; and &quot;The Monk&quot; through the nineteenth century to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&quot;. &quot;Unknown&quot; quickly separated itself from &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, whose fantasies still primarily aimed to produce fear or shock. The closest predecessor to &quot;Unknown&quot; was Thorne Smith, whose prohibition-era &quot;Topper&quot; stories also mixed fantasy with humor. Before &quot;Unknown&quot;, fantasy had received little serious attention, though on occasion writers such as James Branch Cabell had achieved respectability. In Ashley&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Unknown&quot; created the modern genre of fantasy, though commercial success for the genre had to wait until the 1970s.

Clareson also suggests that &quot;Unknown&quot; influenced the science fiction that appeared in &quot;Astounding&quot; after &quot;Unknown&quot; folded. According to this view, stories such as Clifford Simak&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; series would not have appeared without the destruction of genre boundaries that Campbell oversaw. Clareson further proposes that &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, two of the most important and successful science fiction and fantasy magazines, were direct descendants of &quot;Unknown&quot;.

&quot;Unknown&quot; is widely regarded as the finest fantasy magazine ever published: Ashley says, for example, that &quot;&quot;Unknown&quot; published without doubt the greatest collection of fantasy stories produced in one magazine.&quot; Despite its lack of commercial success, &quot;Unknown&quot; is the most lamented of all science fiction and fantasy magazines; Lester del Rey describes it as having gained &quot;a devotion from its readers that no other magazine can match&quot;. Edwards comments that &quot;Unknown&quot; &quot;appeared during Campbell&#x27;s peak years as an editor; its reputation may stand as high as it does partly because it died while still at its best&quot;.

==Bibliographic details==

&quot;Unknown&quot; was edited by John W. Campbell and published by Street &amp; Smith Publications throughout its run. It was pulp-sized from its launch through August 1941, and then bedsheet-sized from October 1941 to April 1943. The last three issues were pulp-sized again. Street &amp; Smith had planned to switch it to digest size with the December 1943 issue, but it was canceled before that issue appeared. The price began at 20 cents and rose to 25 cents with the change to bedsheet size; it remained at 25 cents when the size changed back to pulp. It had 164 pages when pulp-sized and 130 pages while it was bedsheet-sized. It began as a monthly and switched to bimonthly from December 1940 on. The volume numbering was regular, with six volumes of six numbers and a final volume of three numbers. The title began as simply &quot;Unknown&quot;. In December 1940 &quot;Fantasy Fiction&quot; was added as a subtitle, and from the October 1941 issue the title became &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot;.

The first six U.S. issues were available directly in the UK, but thereafter an abridged British reprint edition was issued by Atlas Publications, beginning in September 1939. It was pulp-sized, and priced at 9d (nine pence) throughout. It appeared on a regular monthly schedule until December 1940, after which the schedule became quite irregular, with two or three issues appearing each year until 1949. The volume numbering initially followed the corresponding U.S. editions, with some omitted numbers in 1942 and 1943, and then disappeared for four issues; from the twenty-eighth issue (Spring 1945) the magazine was numbered as if it had been given volumes of twelve numbers since the start of the run. The title was changed from &quot;Unknown&quot; to &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot; with the March 1942 issue.

===Related publications===
In 1948, Street &amp; Smith reprinted several stories from &quot;Unknown&quot; in a bedsheet-sized magazine format, priced at 25 cents, with the title &quot;From Unknown Worlds&quot;. This was an attempt to determine if there was a market for a revived &quot;Unknown&quot;. Street &amp; Smith printed 300,000 copies, against the advice of John Campbell, but although it sold better than the original, too many copies were returned for the publisher to be willing to revive the magazine. The issue was reprinted in Britain in 1952, reduced in size to and cut from 130 pages to 124; it was priced at 2/6 (two shillings and six pence). Part of the run was issued in a hardcover binding at a higher price. One story from the U.S. version was omitted: &quot;One Man&#x27;s Harp&quot; by Babette Rosmond.

Three anthologies of stories from &quot;Unknown&quot; were published in the early 1960s. &quot;The Unknown Five&quot; includes four stories reprinted from &quot;Unknown&quot; and the first print appearance of &quot;Author! Author!&quot;, by Isaac Asimov, which was sold to &quot;Unknown&quot; shortly before Street &amp; Smith shut it down. Two additional &quot;Unknown&quot; anthologies were published in the late 1980s.

<text>Jane Avril (9 June 186817 January 1943) was a French can-can dancer made famous by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec through his paintings. Extremely thin, &quot;given to jerky movements and sudden contortions&quot;, she was nicknamed &quot;La Mélinite&quot;, after an explosive.

==Biography==
She was born Jeanne Louise Beaudon on 9June 1868 in Belleville, in the 20th arrondissement of Paris (though her biographer, Jose Shercliff—whose account of the dancer&#x27;s life is highly romanticised—employed the surname “Richepin” in her publication). Her mother Léontine Clarisse Beaudon was a prostitute who was known as &quot;La Belle Élise&quot;, and her father was an Italian aristocrat named Luigi de Font who separated from her mother when Avril was two years old. Avril was raised by her grandparents in the countryside until her mother took her back with the intent of turning her into a prostitute.

Living in poverty and abused by her alcoholic mother, she ran away from home as a teenager, and was eventually admitted to the Salpêtrière Hospital in December 1882, with the movement disorder known as &quot;St Vitus&#x27; Dance&quot;, with symptoms that included nervous tics, thrashing of limbs, and rhythmic swaying. Under the care of Dr.Jean-Martin Charcot, the expert on &quot;female hysteria&quot;, she received various kinds of treatment, and claimed in her biography that, when she discovered dance at a social ball for employees and patients at the hospital celebrating Mardi Gras, she was cured, although a modern biography of her argues that this story is unlikely, as she was discharged in June 1884, months before any Mardi Gras celebration would take place.

Regardless, she incorporated some of the mannerisms into her dance style, but it is unclear if she was actually afflicted by the condition or if it was simply a marketing strategy, as nervous conditions such as hysteria were associated with elegance by writers of the time (or both), She was certainly known for her unusual style, which was described as &quot;an orchid in a frenzy&quot;. The Belgian author Frantz Jourdain described her as &quot;this exquisite creature, nervous and neurotic, the captivating flower of artistic corruption and of sickly grace&quot;.


On leaving the hospital, after a failed romance with a doctor, Avril pondered committing suicide, but was taken in by Parisian prostitutes. Working at whatever day jobs were available, including as a secretary to Arsène Houssaye, as a rider or acrobat at the and as a cashier at the Exposition Universelle in 1889, at night, she pursued a career in dancing by performing at local dance halls and &quot;cafés-concerts&quot;. In 1888, she met the writer René Boylesve (18671926) who became her lover. Using the stage name Jane Avril, suggested by an English lover, she built a reputation that eventually allowed her to make a living as a full-time dancer. During this time, she became known by various nicknames: &quot;La Mélinite&quot; after an explosive, &quot;L&#x27;Etrange&quot; (&quot;The Strange One&quot;), and &quot;Jane la Folle&quot; (&quot;Jane the Crazy&quot;).

Hired by the Moulin Rouge nightclub in 1889, within a few years, she headlined at the Jardin de Paris, one of the major &quot;cafés-concerts&quot; on the Champs-Élysées. To advertise the extravaganza, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec painted her portrait on a poster that elevated her stature in the entertainment world even further. The popularity of the can-can became such that Avril travelled with a dance troupe to perform in London in 1896.

In 1895, Louise Weber, known by her stage name &quot;La Goulue&quot; (&quot;The Glutton&quot;) and the most famous dancer in Paris, left the Moulin Rouge, and Avril was chosen to replace her. Graceful, soft-spoken, and melancholic, Avril gave a dance presentation that was the opposite of the very boisterous La Goulue. Nevertheless, the club&#x27;s patrons adored her, and she became one of the most recognizable names of the Parisian nightlife. A younger dancer, May Milton, arrived in Paris in 1895 and she and Avril had a short but passionate affair. From another liaison, she bore a son, and beginning in 1901, appeared in theatre, taking roles in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, as well as a stage adaptation of &quot;Claudine at School&quot; by Colette.

In 1905, she retired from performing altogether and married the French artist, Maurice Biais (18721926) in 1911, who adopted her son. They moved to a home in Jouy-en-Josas at the outskirts of Paris. However, Biais suffered from lung disease and the couple separated in the 1920s, with Biais moving to the south of France, where he died. She was bankrupted by the Great Depression and died on in poverty and obscurity. She was interred in the Biais family plot in Paris&#x27; Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Zsa Zsa Gabor portrayed Avril in the original &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952); half a century later, the semi-fictionalized character was reinterpreted by Nicole Kidman in &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001). Avril is one of the characters in Per Olov Enquist&#x27;s book &quot;The Book of Blanche and Marie&quot;, which portrays the lives of Marie &quot;Blanche&quot; Wittman and Marie Curie.

<text>The 1997 Winchester by-election was a by-election to the UK House of Commons in the constituency of Winchester, Hampshire. Winchester was initially declared to have been won by Mark Oaten (Liberal Democrat) with a majority of two votes at the general election on 1 May 1997, but following a legal challenge, a new election was allowed by the High Court. The by-election, held on 20 November, was won by Oaten with a majority of 21,556.

==History==
At the general election on 1 May 1997, Mark Oaten was originally declared the winner, with a majority of two votes over Conservative Gerry Malone, 20 hours after starting to count votes, with many recounts and haggling over spoilt ballots.

Oaten was unseated on an electoral petition on 6 October 1997. The High Court held that 54 votes declared void for want of the official mark would have changed the result if counted. The court could not be sure they were not the product of a mistake, therefore deemed that the result was uncertain. They allowed the petition and declared the election void. The writ for the new election was moved on 28 October 1997.

The by-election on 20 November resulted in a clear win by Oaten – his majority was 21,556 over second placed Malone. Campaigning had focused on Oaten&#x27;s speaking record in the House of Commons after the general election, while the nature of the controversial 1 May election result was also an issue for some Liberal Democrat voters.

&quot;The Independent&quot; wrote, &quot;Although careful not to articulate it themselves, their unofficial campaign slogan is: &#x27;When the umpire gives you out, you should walk, alluding to the unseated Malone. The Labour Party obtained their worst ever results in a parliamentary election at the time, in part because they hardly campaigned at all and instead focused their priorities on the by-election in Beckenham held on the same day, which they also failed to win. The Winchester by-election remained Labour&#x27;s worst-ever result until 2021, when they polled 1.6 per cent of the vote in the Chesham and Amersham by-election, again won by the Lib Dems.

Both the original and rerun election involved an incidence of a candidate using an attempted confusing description. Richard Huggett described himself in the general election as &quot;Liberal Democrat Top Choice For Parliament&quot; (leading to Oaten, the official Lib Dem candidate, to use the ballot paper description &quot;Liberal Democrat Leader Paddy Ashdown&quot;) and in the by election as &quot;Literal Democrat Mark Here to Win&quot;. The Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 put an end to this practice.

This was also the last election in which Screaming Lord Sutch, founder of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, ran for a parliamentary seat. He died by suicide in June 1999.

<text>George Hurley (born September 4, 1958) is a drummer noted for his work with Minutemen and fIREHOSE.

== Music career ==

=== Early years ===
Originally from the East Coast, Hurley and his family moved to San Pedro, California, when he was six years old. Hurley was a surfer before devoting himself to music.

A self-taught musician, Hurley created his own drumsticks out of Plexiglas and wood at the Boys Club in his youth. He got his first drumkit when he was nineteen after trading a motorcycle for it.

Although he is known as a punk drummer, Hurley&#x27;s musical influences are primarily jazz-based.

Even though he went to the same high school as D. Boon and Mike Watt he did not meet them until around 1978. That same year, Hurley formed the Reactionaries with Boon, Watt, and Martin Tamburovich. Watt asked Hurley to join repeatedly but Hurley was reticent because they traveled in different circles and Watt was deemed &quot;a geek&quot;. Eventually, Hurley threw caution to the wind and joined up with Watt. After the Reactionaries split, George joined a Hollywood new wave band called Hey Taxi!. In 1980, Hey Taxi! disbanded at the same time the Minutemen&#x27;s then drummer Frank Tonche left the band. Hurley reunited with his two former Reactionaries bandmates in Minutemen.

=== Minutemen ===
The Minutemen played their first gig with Los Angeles band Black Flag and after their set were asked by Black Flag guitarist and SST Records founder Greg Ginn to record an album for his label. The &quot;Paranoid Time&quot; EP was followed by full-length albums &quot;The Punch Line&quot; and &quot;What Makes a Man Start Fires?&quot; and two more EPs, &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;Bean-Spill&quot;, before recording their magnum opus, &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot;, an album which appears on many music critics&#x27; lists of the all-time best rock albums, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Slant Magazine listed the album at on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;.

In 1985, D. Boon died in a van accident following the release of their final full-length album, &quot;3-Way Tie (For Last)&quot;, at which point Minutemen disbanded.

===fIREHOSE===
Watt and Hurley formed fIREHOSE in 1986, alongside newcomer Ed Crawford on guitar and lead vocals. They recorded three albums with SST Records, then joined Columbia Records for two albums and an EP. The band dissolved in 1994 citing creative stagnation, and reformed in 2012 for an appearance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and a short tour.

=== Later work ===
Hurley has played with the Red Krayola and Tom Watson from Slovenly. He also plays with his surviving Minutemen cohort Mike Watt on occasion, usually performing a set of Minutemen songs without a third person substituting for the late Minutemen leader D. Boon under the name George Hurley and Mike Watt. In addition, he occasionally performs with improvisational group Unknown Instructors with Watt and members of Saccharine Trust and Pere Ubu. Their first album, &quot;The Way Things Work&quot;, was released in late September 2005 by Smog Veil Records. In October 2005, they returned to the studio to record their second album, this time with Pere Ubu&#x27;s David Thomas as an added participant.

Hurley has formed a drum/bass duo with Constant Llama member Joe Dean called the Wrinkling Brothers.

==Personal life==
Hurley has been married since 1997 and has a son, Garrett, who was born in July 2002.

=== Hairstyle ===
Hurley is known for his distinctive hairstyle that he sported in his later Minutemen and Firehose days, a protruding clump of hair that he nicknamed &quot;The Unit&quot;. Hurley explained in the 2005 Minutemen documentary &quot;We Jam Econo&quot; that since his limbs were all busy when he played drums, he grew &quot;The Unit&quot; so that his head movements were more noticeable on stage.

<text>Allertonshire or Allerton was a wapentake and liberty in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England.

Northallerton, current name of Allerton, was historically associated with the Bishopric of Durham, being an ecclesiastical peculiar and exclave until the 19th century.

The shire&#x27;s central location in the North Riding (1889-1974) and its successor North Yorkshire (1974–present) allowed the town to become the administrative centre for both counties.

The contiguous part of the wapentake included the ancient parishes of:
*Birkby
*Kirby Sigston
*Leake
*Northallerton
*Osmotherley
*North Otterington
*Thornton-le-Street

The wapentake also included exclaves of:
*the extra parochial area of Hutton Conyers
*the parish of West Rounton
*the parish of Sessay
*the Yorkshire part of the parish of Sockburn (townships of Girsby and Over Dinsdale)

The wapentake also included part of the parish of Kirklington, including the vill of Howgrave.

<doc id="850086" wikidata="Q701723" url="?curid=850086" title="Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh">
<text>Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (15 January 1776 – 30 November 1834) was a great-grandson of King George II of Great Britain and the nephew and son-in-law of King George III. He was the grandson of both Frederick, Prince of Wales (George II&#x27;s eldest son), and Edward Walpole. Prince William married Princess Mary, the fourth daughter of George III.

==Early life==
Prince William Frederick was born on 15 January 1776 at Palazzo Teodoli in via del Corso, Rome. His father was Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the third son of the Prince of Wales. His mother, Maria, was the illegitimate daughter of Edward Walpole and granddaughter of Robert Walpole. As a great-grandson of George II he held the title of Prince of Great Britain with the style &quot;His Highness&quot;, not &quot;His Royal Highness&quot;, at birth. The young prince was baptized at Teodoli Palace, on 12 February 1776 by a Rev Salter. His godparents were his father&#x27;s cousin and cousin-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg; and the Duke of Gloucester&#x27;s second cousin, the Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach.

During his stay in Stockholm in 1802–1803, William&#x27;s interest and rumoured affair with Aurora Wilhelmina Koskull attracted a lot of attention, and he reportedly had plans to marry her. Queen Charlotte recalled that William said of Koskull: &quot;If she was your daughter, I would marry her!&quot;

William was admitted to the University of Cambridge (Trinity College) in 1787, and granted his MA in 1790. He set up his London home at 31 Upper Grosvenor Street, Mayfair. On 25 August 1805, Prince William&#x27;s father died, and he inherited the titles Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh and Earl of Connaught. 

From 1811 until his death, William was Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. He was offered the throne of Sweden in 1812 by some members of the Swedish nobility, but the British government would not allow it; the French marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte was eventually selected to become King Charles XIV John.

==Military career==
On the outbreak of war with France in 1793, Prince William was commissioned as a captain in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Army, backdated to March 1789. He was promoted to colonel on 24 February 1794, and served in the Flanders campaign from March to May that year. On 26 February 1795 he was promoted to major-general. From September to October 1799 he commanded a brigade of Foot Guards in the Helder Expedition, for which he was mentioned in despatches. On 13 November 1799 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and held various home commands before being promoted to general on 25 April 1808. On 26 May 1816 he was promoted field marshal.

He was colonel of the 115th Regiment of Foot (Prince William&#x27;s) from 1794, then colonel of the 6th Regiment of Foot from 1795 and finally colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards from 1806 until his death.

==Marriage==
According to letters held in the archive of the artist and barrister&#x27;s clerk Anthony Crosby, the Duke married Ann Maguire (1786-1850), in a clandestine ceremony on 6 July 1811 conducted at the house of his friend, Ann Hamilton, at 2 Grafton Street, Mayfair, London. The ceremony was reportedly conducted by the Rev. Thomas Pettingal, Rector of Easthampstead, Berkshire, with those present including Hamilton, Lady Jane Lanesborough (the widow of Brinsley Butler, 2nd Earl of Lanesborough) and her husband John King. Maguire claims the Duke maintained a relationship with her until his death in 1834. No marriage certificate is known, and any such marriage would be invalid under the Royal Marriages Act. After the Duke&#x27;s death an annuity of £200 per year was purchased for Maguire from the Duke&#x27;s estate.

On 22 July 1816, Prince William married his first cousin Princess Mary, the fourth daughter of King George III. The marriage took place at St. James&#x27;s Palace, London. On that day, the Prince Regent granted the Duke the style of &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; by Order in Council.

The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester lived at Bagshot Park in Surrey. They had no children together; they had married when both were 40. The Duke had been encouraged to stay single, so that there might be a suitable groom for Princess Charlotte of Wales, who was expected to succeed to the throne, if no foreign match proved suitable; she had married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg ten weeks earlier.

==Later life==
William was active in many walks of life, and on 27 April 1822 he chaired the first Annual General Meeting of London&#x27;s new United University Club. In politics, &quot;the Duke generally voted with the Whigs&quot; but only entered the House of Lords rarely and voted on few of the great issues of his time. He did advocate the abolition of slavery, and he supported Caroline of Brunswick and Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, against King George IV. In a speech at the House of Lords on 5 February 1807, he stated that 

 My lords, I cannot find language sufficiently strong to express my abhorrence and detestation of this abominable traffic in human blood; and I think the present question is the most momentous that ever came before your lordships: for what question can be more momentous, or come more closely home to our bosoms and our feelings of humanity, than that which concerns the welfare, the happiness, nay even the lives of myriads of our fellow creatures? Adverting to the resolution of last parliament, now on your lordships&#x27; table, declaring that the Slave Trade is contrary to justice, humanity, and policy, can you still allow British subjects to carry on what has been thus solemnly declared to be unjust, inhuman, and impolitic? 

In the 1790s, William and his friends John Opie - who had painted the Duke&#x27;s portrait - and his wife Amelia Opie were regular guests at Earlham Hall, the seat of the Gurney family who, like the Duke and the Opies, were Whigs and abolitionists. Upon John Opie&#x27;s death, the Duke wrote a letter of sympathy to Amelia saying he was glad Royal etiquette allowed him to follow the Opie funeral procession in his carriage to St. Paul’s Cathedral where Opie would be buried.

The Duke of Gloucester kept more state than the King; he never permitted a gentleman to be seated in his presence (which King George did as an exceptional favour) and expected to be served coffee by the ladies of any party he attended, and that they would stand while he drank it. The general estimate of his capacity is given by his nickname, &quot;Silly Billy&quot;; he was also called &quot;Slice of Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Cheese&quot;, a reference to Gloucester cheese.

Because of the unequal character of his parents&#x27; marriage, the Duke was excluded from the House of Hanover, being considered only a British prince. For instance, he and his sister Sophia were not listed in the genealogical listing of the electoral house of Hanover in the &quot;Königlicher Groß-Britannischer und Kurfürstlicher Braunschweig-Lüneburgscher Staats-Kalender&quot;. He was also not invited to sign the family compact of the house of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1831, which means that he was not considered an agnate of the royal (electoral) house in Germany.

The Duke died on 30 November 1834 at Bagshot Park, and was buried in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

Connaught Place, Connaught Street and Connaught Square in the Tyburnia district north of London&#x27;s Hyde Park all take their name from his subsidiary title the Earl of Connaught. The area was developed in the 1820s and still features much of its original Regency architecture.

==Honours==
*KG: Knight of the Garter, &quot;16 July 1794&quot;

==Arms==

William was granted use of his father&#x27;s arms (being the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label argent of five points, the centre bearing a fleur-de-lys azure, the other points each bearing a cross gules&quot;), the whole differenced by a &quot;label argent&quot; (or &quot;azure&quot;).

<text>The dropping point of a lubricating grease is an indication of the heat resistance of the grease and is the temperature at which it passes from a semi-solid to a liquid state under specific test conditions. It is dependent on the type of thickener used and the cohesiveness of the oil and thickener of a grease. The dropping point indicates the upper temperature limit at which a grease retains its structure though is not necessarily the maximum temperature at which a grease can be used.

Dropping point is used in combination with other testable properties to determine the suitability of greases for specific applications and for use in quality control.

== ASTM test procedure ==
The dropping point test procedures are given in ASTM standards D-566 and D-2265. The test apparatus consists of a grease cup with a small hole in the bottom, test tube, two thermometers, a container, stirring device if required and an electric heater. The inside surfaces of the grease cup are coated with the grease to be tested. A thermometer is inserted into the cup and held in place so that the thermometer does not touch the grease. This assembly is placed inside a test tube. The test tube is lowered into the container which is filled with oil in D-566 and has an aluminum block in D-2265. Another thermometer is inserted into the oil/block.

To execute a test, the oil/block is heated, while being stirred, at a rate of to per minute until the temperature is approximately below the expected dropping point. The heat is reduced until the test tube temperature is at most less than the oil/block temperature. Once the temperature has stabilized the sample is inserted. The dropping point is the temperature recorded on the test tube thermometer, plus a correction factor for the oil/block temperature, when a drop of grease falls through the hole in the grease cup. If the drop trails a thread, the dropping temperature is the temperature at which the thread breaks.
D-2265 explains that the dropping point is useful to assist in identifying the type of grease, and for establishing and maintaining benchmarks for quality control. It adds that the results are not sufficient to assess service performance because dropping point is a static test.

<doc id="850092" wikidata="Q903412" url="?curid=850092" title="Soyuz T-13">
<text>Soyuz T-13 was a Soyuz mission, transporting personnel to the Soviet space station Salyut 7. The eighth expedition to the orbital station, the mission launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, atop a Soyuz-U2 carrier rocket, at 06:39:52 UTC on June 6, 1985. It is of note because it marked the first time a spacecraft had docked with a &#x27;dead&#x27; space station, and the first time such a station had been returned to operational status following repairs.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission highlights==
Soyuz T-13 was the 8th expedition to Salyut 7.

Vladimir Dzhanibekov, having previously flown to Salyut 7 on the Soyuz T-12 mission, returned on the next flight which was to become the first to dock manually with an inert space station, as the station had been crippled by a solar array problem. For this purpose modifications were made to the Soyuz spacecraft to include control levers for proximity operations. Viktor Savinykh&#x27;s and Vladimir Dzhanibekov&#x27;s mission was successful and they were able to salvage the Salyut 7 station. Savinykh remained aloft for 169 days, returning to Earth in Soyuz T-14; Dzhanibekov returned to Earth in Soyuz T-13 with Grechko after spending 110 days on Salyut 7. Before deorbiting, Soyuz T-13 spent about 30 hours conducting rendezvous and docking tests.

===Salvaging Salyut 7===
The effort to salvage Salyut 7 was, in the words of author David S. F. Portree, &quot;one of the most impressive feats of in-space repairs in history&quot;. As the crew approached the inert station, they saw that its solar arrays were pointing randomly as it rolled slowly about its long axis. They used a handheld laser rangefinder to judge their distance, and conducted a fly-around inspection to be certain the exterior was intact. Dzhanibekov noted that the thermal blankets on the transfer compartment had turned a dull gray from prolonged exposure to sunlight.

Dzhanibekov piloted his ship to intercept the forward port of Salyut 7, matched the station&#x27;s rotation and achieved soft dock with the station. Upon achieving hard dock—the first time a Soyuz had docked with an inert space station—the crew confirmed through the electrical connectors in the docking collars that the Salyut 7 electrical system was dead. They carefully sampled the air in the station before opening the hatch. The station air was very cold, but breathable. Frost covered the walls and apparatus. The cosmonauts wore winter garb, including fur-lined hats, as they entered the station.

The first order of business was to restore electric power. Two of the eight batteries were destroyed, the rest fully discharged. Dzhanibekov determined that a sensor in the solar array pointing system had failed, preventing the batteries from recharging. A telemetry radio problem prevented the TsUP (mission control center) from detecting the problem. Salyut 7 had quickly run down its batteries, shutting down all its systems and accounting for the break in radio contact. The cosmonauts set about recharging the batteries and used Soyuz T-13 to turn the station in order to point its solar arrays to the sun.

On June 10 they turned on the air heaters. The cosmonauts relied on the Soyuz T-13 air regeneration system until they could get the Salyut 7 system back in order. On June 13 the attitude control system was successfully reactivated. This was cause for jubilation, as it meant Kosmos 1669 (a Progress supply spacecraft) bearing replacement parts could dock with Salyut 7. The station&#x27;s water tanks thawed by the end of June – freezing had destroyed the water heater, so the cosmonauts used a powerful television light to heat fluids. Wall heaters were turned on only after all the frost had evaporated, in order to prevent water from entering equipment. Normal atmospheric humidity was achieved only at the end of July, nearly two months after docking.

<doc id="850094" wikidata="Q3602308" url="?curid=850094" title="Active valve control system">
<text>The active valve control system (AVCS) is an automobile variable valve timing technology used by Subaru. It varies the timing of the valves by using hydraulic oil pressure to rotate the camshaft, known as &quot;phasing&quot;, in order to provide optimal valve timing for engine load conditions. The system is closed loop using the camshaft sensors, crankshaft sensors, air flow meter, throttle position as well as oxygen sensors and/or Air-Fuel ratio sensors in order to calculate engine load. The ECU is programmed to operate control valves that adjust the delivery of the hydraulic pressure in order to move the camshaft into the position that will provide the engine with the best performance while meeting emissions standards.

AVCS is used on the Version 7 and up EJ207 engines, the EJ204, EJ254, EJ255, EJ257, the second generation EZ30D (2005+ in the USA market) found in the Legacy Outback, Legacy 2.0R, 3.0R and the B9 Tribeca.

A dual AVCS system phases both the intake and exhaust camshafts on the EZ36 found in the 2008+ Tribeca, 2009+ Outback 3.6R, 2009+ Legacy 3.6R, and on the 2008+ STi EJ257 (W25 heads). Dual AVCS is present on the new FA20 engines in the 2015+ WRX, Forester and BRZ and the FB20 engines in the 2012+ Impreza / Crosstrek, though they actuate with a different method than those of the older engines. Dual AVCS is also found on Japanese-spec engines, notably the late model EJ207s in the WRX STI.

==AVCS==

The implementation of AVCS is quite different from AVLS. The latter only changes the cam profile that&#x27;s operating the two valves.

In AVCS, the engine computer (ECU) can command a solenoid which advances or retards the camshaft rotation by up to 35 degrees.

By retarding the cams at idle or very low engine loads, a smoother, easier idle can be achieved. From idle through medium engine loads, AVCS advances the intake valves to begin opening during the last part of the exhaust stroke, when the exhaust valves are still slightly open. Some of the pressure created during the exhaust stroke flows into the intake manifold, having the effect of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The intake valves also close earlier during the intake stroke. This helps with engine efficiency and fuel economy.

At very high engine loads, AVCS advances the intake valves further to open even sooner during the exhaust stroke. This produces a scavenging effect – that is, intake airflow helps clear the cylinder of exhaust gas. It also closes the intake valves sooner on the compression stroke. This results in improved volumetric efficiency, increased dynamic compression, and helps to generate higher power output.

<text>In basketball, a technical foul (colloquially known as a &quot;T&quot; or a &quot;tech&quot;) is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the National Basketball Association (NBA), and potentially so in the NBA).

Technical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States. First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the United States, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running or when the ball is dead. Second, in FIBA play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; committing another risks immediate ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the (W)NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs.

In most American competitions, ejection of the offender, that of the player, coach, or otherwise, is the penalty for being assessed two technical fouls in a game, if charged directly to him/her (some technicals committed by a player are charged to the team only). In addition, any single flagrant technical foul, or a disqualifying foul in FIBA and NCAA women&#x27;s play, incurs ejection. FIBA rules call for ejection for two non-flagrant technicals (known as unsportsmanlike fouls under that body&#x27;s rules; the term is also used in NCAA women&#x27;s rules) against a player. FIBA rules call for ejection when a coach draws two technicals, or a third is called on the bench. In the NBA, there are certain technical fouls that cannot involve an ejection.

==Infractions==
Many infractions can result in the calling of a technical foul. One of the most common is the use of profane language toward an official or another player. This can be called on either players who are currently active in the play of the game, or seated on a team&#x27;s bench. It can also be assessed to a coach or another person associated with the team in an official capacity such as a trainer or an equipment manager. Additionally, coaches or players can be assessed a technical foul for disputing an official&#x27;s call too vehemently, with or without the use of profanity. This verbal unsporting technical foul may be assessed regardless of whether the ball is dead or alive.

Other offenses can result in technical fouls, such as:
* Allowing players to lock arms in order to restrict the movement of an opponent (usually a team technical)
* Baiting or taunting an opponent
* Disrespectfully addressing or contacting an official or gesturing in such a manner as to indicate resentment
* Faking being fouled (flopping). In NCAA women&#x27;s basketball, effective in 2023–24, the first offense is a warning, with subsequent offenses being technical fouls assessed as team personal fouls, but not as individual personal fouls.
*Fighting or threatening to fight
*Goaltending a free throw
*Grasping either basket during pre-game or halftime warm-ups during the time of the officials&#x27; jurisdiction, including attempting to dunk or stuff a dead ball (whether successful or not) prior to or during the game or during any intermission of the game. Beginning in 2015–16, dunking is permitted during warmup periods in NCAA play, although hanging on the rim remains illegal.
*Illegal substitution or entering the game at an impermissible time
*Intentionally hanging on the basket at any time (except to prevent an injury)
*Kicking or striking the basketball at any time using the foot (in an unsportsmanlike manner; unintentional kicking is a violation only)
*Knowingly attempting a free throw or accepting a foul to which the player was not entitled
*Lifting or jumping onto a teammate to gain a height advantage
*Remaining out of bounds to gain an advantage
*Removing the jersey or pants within the visual confines of the playing area
*Shattering the backboard or rim of a goal.
*Use of television monitoring or replay equipment, computers, or electronics such as megaphones for coaching purposes during the game
*Using tobacco or smokeless tobacco

Violations of the rules for delaying the game (in the NBA, NCAA, and NFHS) usually incur a team warning for a first offense, followed by a team technical, or sometimes a player technical, if the same team delays a second time. From 2023–24, NCAA women&#x27;s rules explicitly call for delay of game to be a team warning on the first offense and a team technical thereafter. This includes:
*Going out of bounds during an opponent&#x27;s throw-in without contact (warning, then a technical foul), or touching an opposing thrower-in (intentional foul on the violator in NFHS, and is the warning for being out-of-bounds) or the ball (a technical on the offender in NFHS, and is the warning for being out-of-bounds) as it is held entirely in out-of-bounds
** In the (W)NBA, or since 2022, FIBA, during the last two minutes of any playing period (quarter or overtime), contact by a defensive player against a player throwing the basketball in before the ball is released is not considered delay of game. It is instead a special class of personal foul known as a &quot;throw-in foul&quot; (FIBA) or &quot;away from the play foul&quot; (W(NBA)), and is penalized by one free throw and possession.
*Huddling at the foul line for an excessive time (warning, then a technical in NFHS)
*Not being ready to start play after a time-out, or to begin a quarter or half, or to shoot a free throw(s) at such times (a special protocol, known as the &quot;resumption-of-play procedure&quot;, is used in NFHS, where violations instead of technicals are initially called in some such situations)
*Refusing to immediately pass the ball to the nearest official when a whistle blows
*Failing as the free thrower to be in the free-throw semicircle when the official is ready to administer the free throw (unless the resumption-of-play procedure is in effect in NFHS, &quot;supra&quot;)
*Throwing the ball into the stands or otherwise preventing a ball from being made live promptly after a made goal to allow one&#x27;s team to set up on defense (if a blatantly unsportsmanlike act, a technical foul against the player; otherwise, a warning to that team and team technicals thereafter). This includes throwing the ball to an official when such act is not required—such would likely incur a warning. In addition, throwing the ball at an opponent&#x27;s head may also be considered a technical foul.

and more technical issues, such as:
*Beginning the game with a starting player not so designated
*Failure to supply the scorer with names and numbers of team players prior to the start of the scheduled contest, or at least 10 minutes prior to the contest in some jurisdictions
*Having too many players on the court, or too few (NBA; NCAA and NFHS if intentional)
*If the coach leaves his box, especially to argue. There are times when a coach may go to the scorer&#x27;s table to correct a game error.
*Failing, as the coach, to replace a disqualified player within the allotted time (charged to the coach)
*(NBA only) playing a &quot;scratched&quot; player (a rule adopted in 2005 where up to two &quot;scratches&quot; are permissible on a 14-man roster)
*Refusing to occupy the proper bench
*Remaining in or returning to the game after being disqualified
** In the NBA, there must be five players on the court at all times. A Player Foul Penalty situation exists if a player is assessed a sixth or subsequent personal foul and must remain in the game because there are no eligible players on the bench, or if after an injury or ejection, the last player to be disqualified for his sixth personal foul must return to the game. The penalty is a technical foul (with one free throw) for each extra personal foul or returning to the game after disqualification.
*Requesting an excess time-out
*Uniform violations, including illegal insignia or numbers; having 2 or more players with the same number; or having the wrong number for a player in the official scorebook

The NBA has an Illegal Defense rule. Until 2001, it was designed to stop defenders from dropping back into a zone and thus preventing drives to the basket. The penalty, after a warning, was a technical foul charged to the offending team and one shot for the offense, except that if the first violation occurred within 24 seconds of the end of a period, the technical was assessed without warning.

Beginning with the , the rule, now known as &quot;Defensive Three Seconds,&quot; prohibits a defender from being in the shooting lane for three seconds, unless guarding an opponent within arm&#x27;s reach (or the player with the ball, regardless of distance). The penalty is the same as it was for an illegal defense, except that no warning is issued. The WNBA implemented this rule in 2013. Any technical fouls for Illegal Defense do not count towards ejection.

Additionally, home teams can be assessed technical fouls resulting from their partisans&#x27; misconduct for excessive use of artificial noise, the playing of music by their band, or for dangerous offenses such as throwing items (particularly ice or coins) onto the court.

Usually a fight or lesser altercation between players results in a &quot;double technical&quot;, in which a technical foul is issued to both players involved. If any player leaves the team bench during a fight, he can be charged with a technical foul and ejected, as can any coach that does so without the beckoning of an official. Rules against fighting vary from high school to college to the (W)NBA, but all levels penalize severely for such conduct, to include suspensions and (in the [W]NBA) heavy fines. NFHS and NCAA require the automatic ejection of bench personnel leaving the team area during a fight, whether or not these players actually participate in the fight.

Beginning with the , the NBA began to crack down on general complaining. Technical fouls can now be issued for the following:
*Making aggressive gestures anywhere on the court
*Disagreement in which a player demonstrates how he was fouled
*Running toward an official to complain about a call
*Excessive inquiries about a call

==Penalty==

In college basketball, NFHS, and lower divisions, the penalty for technical fouls has increased over the years. Initially, the opposing team was awarded one free throw. This later increased to one free throw and possession of the ball. For a while, &quot;bench technicals&quot; assessed on a non-active player, assistant coach, or anyone else on the team bench were considered more serious and resulted in the award of two shots. (Coaches have their own technical fouls, although they may be ejected and/or suspended if they have a mix of technicals totaling two or three fouls, depending on seriousness.)

Today, high school basketball (NFHS in the United States) provides for two free throws and possession of the ball at the division line opposite the scorer&#x27;s table, regardless of circumstances, for a technical foul. International basketball provides a similar penalty. Before the 2015–16 season, college basketball awarded two shots for all technical fouls, with the ball then put in play at the point of interruption (POI), the spot and circumstances where play was stopped for the technical. Since 2015–16, the NCAA awards only one free throw for so-called &quot;Class B&quot; technicals, such as hanging on the rim or delay of game; &quot;Class A&quot; technical fouls still result in two free throws. In the (W)NBA, the penalty remains one free throw for the opposing team, with play resuming from the point of interruption. The shot clock is reset to 14 seconds if it read less than such at the time of the foul. The team awarded the foul shots for a technical may select the player(s) to shoot them (this rule differs slightly from level to level and internationally), as opposed to personal fouls, where the player fouled, unless injured, must shoot his own foul shots.

In the (W)NBA, technical fouls are split into two classes, unsportsmanlike and non-unsportsmanlike. A player assessed an unsportsmanlike technical foul is fined, and accumulating sixteen unsportsmanlike technical fouls during the regular season will result in a one-game suspension. For every two technical fouls received thereafter during that regular season, the player or coach&#x27;s suspension increases by one game. Penalties for unsportsmanlike technical fouls are even higher for playoff games. Players and coaches will be fined for every unsportsmanlike technical foul they receive. Those who accumulate seven unsportsmanlike technical fouls will be suspended for one game. For every two unsportsmanlike technical fouls received thereafter, the player or coach&#x27;s next suspension increases by one game.

Non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical fouls are defined per NBA Rule 12, Section V, Paragraph c, and none count towards a fine, ejection or suspension. These fouls are assessed for excessive time-outs, defensive three seconds, scratched player dressing and playing, a player foul penalty situation, shattering backboards, or delay of game. An offensive player who intentionally hangs on the backboard, unless it is legal for safety reasons, is fined $500 but is only assessed a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. Technical fouls assessed for a player foul penalty situation caused by an offensive foul still result in one free throw.

The league can reclassify an unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul as a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul after a game following review. For example, the NBA changed the technical foul by DeMarcus Cousins for clearing Jeremy Lamb&#x27;s loose shoe off the playing court in a Golden State Warriors v. Charlotte Hornets game on February 25, 2019, from unsportsmanlike to non-unsportsmanlike, rescinding the fine and the foul count, primarily over safety issues.

==Notable instances==
One of the most famous technical fouls ever assessed was called on Chris Webber of the University of Michigan late in the 1993 NCAA championship game. Down by two points to North Carolina with only seconds remaining, Webber called a time-out when Michigan had none left. The resulting excessive time-out technical foul, for which North Carolina guard Donald Williams made both foul shots, ended any hopes Michigan had of claiming the championship. 

A string of famous technical fouls occurred on February 23, 1985, at a regular season game between the rival Purdue Boilermakers and Indiana Hoosiers. Just five minutes into the game, a scramble for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana. IU&#x27;s legendary head coach Bob Knight was furious and insisted the call should have been a jump ball. Seconds after Purdue inbounded, another foul was called on Indiana. Knight received a technical for his irate reaction, and then famously threw a red plastic chair from Indiana&#x27;s bench across the court, resulting in a second technical. As his tirade continued, he received a third technical and was ejected from the game to a standing ovation from the home crowd at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. The picture of Knight throwing the chair has since become a potent symbol of the Indiana–Purdue rivalry.

In what has been called the greatest game ever played, Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals between the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics, the Suns found themselves one point down with one second left in double overtime, no time-outs remaining and possession of the ball under their defensive basket after a John Havlicek bucket. Faced with the near-impossibility of sinking an 80-foot desperation shot, Suns guard Paul Westphal hit upon an unusual solution. He &quot;intentionally&quot; called a time-out the Suns did not have. While this gave the Celtics a free throw, which Jo Jo White successfully converted to increase the lead to two, it gave the Suns possession at halfcourt, and enabled Gar Heard to sink an 18-footer as time expired to force a third overtime. NBA rules were changed the following year to prevent a repeat occurrence.

An instance where many technical fouls could have been called, but were not (instead, the game was abandoned, a remedy available to the officials when too many players would have or have been disqualified or ejected for the game to continue, or when a team continually commits technical fouls in order to make a travesty of proceedings), was the Pacers–Pistons brawl involving players and spectators on November 19, 2004, in an NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons. Ron Artest of the Pacers and Ben Wallace of the Pistons began scuffling after Artest fouled Wallace hard. This escalated into a brawl where players from both teams became involved, and grew worse after Artest retreated to the scorer&#x27;s table and was hit by a cup thrown by a spectator. Artest and several teammates and opponents then ran into the stands and fought with fans. Had technical fouls been formally assessed, the result would likely have been the ejection of both teams&#x27; entire squads (except for Pistons player Tayshaun Prince, who was the only player from either team to remain on the bench for the entire incident). In the end, nine players were suspended for a total of 146 games, including Artest for the remainder of the season.

In a 2007 game against the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs&#x27; power forward Tim Duncan was charged a technical foul by referee Joe Crawford for laughing at him while sitting on the bench (&quot;gesturing in such a manner as to indicate resentment,&quot; as indicated above). As he had already picked up a technical foul on the previous play, also while sitting on the bench, this led to his ejection. Upon further review it was determined that this technical foul was inconsistent with the league&#x27;s game management, and NBA commissioner David Stern suspended Crawford for the rest of the season. Duncan was fined $25,000 for the incident.

On October 25, 2022, the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns set the record for most combined technical fouls in a quarter with 7 technicals in the 3rd quarter.

Rasheed Wallace holds the record for the most technical fouls received during one season in the NBA. In the 2000–01 season, he received 41 technical fouls in 80 regular season and postseason games played. Karl Malone holds the all-time mark for most technical fouls by a player in a career with 332, a record previously held by Dennis Rodman.

There have been a few instances in the NBA when a team&#x27;s entire bench has either been injured or fouled out, and one of the five remaining eligible players fouls out, resulting in the technical foul that effectively acts as a bonus free throw situation. The Atlanta Hawks&#x27; Cliff Levingston (fouled out, but one of the five remaining players was ejected) and the Los Angeles Lakers&#x27; Robert Sacre (fouled out) have both taken advantage of the disqualified player rule. Under NBA Rule 3-I-a (player fouls out) and 3-I-b (player injured or ejected), the player was assessed with a technical foul for remaining in the game or returning to the game after fouling out.

<text>Natalina &quot;Lina&quot; Cavalieri (25 December 1874 – 7 February 1944) was an Italian operatic dramatic soprano, actress, and monologist.

==Biography==
Lina Cavalieri was born on Christmas Day at Viterbo, some north of Rome. She lost her parents at the age of fifteen and became a ward of the state, sent to live in a Roman Catholic orphanage. The vivacious young girl was unhappy under the strict discipline of the nuns, and at the first opportunity she ran away with a touring theatrical group.

At a young age, she made her way to Paris, France, where her appearance opened doors and she obtained work as a singer at one of the city&#x27;s café-concerts. From there she performed at a variety of music halls and other such venues around Europe, while still working to develop her voice. She took voice lessons and made her opera debut in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1900 (as Nedda in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;). The Russian Prince Alexander Bariatinsky was deeply in love with Lina, and they had an open affair, but never became husband and wife as his parents and Tsar Nicholas II himself strongly opposed this marriage. In 1904, she sang at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo then in 1905, at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in Paris, Cavalieri starred opposite Enrico Caruso in the Umberto Giordano opera &quot;Fedora&quot;. From there, she and Caruso took the opera to New York City, debuting with it at the Metropolitan Opera on 5 December 1906.
Cavalieri remained with the Metropolitan Opera for the next two seasons, performing again with Caruso in 1907, in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;. She became one of the most photographed stars of her time. Frequently referred to as the &quot;world&#x27;s most beautiful woman&quot;, she was part of the tightlacing tradition that saw women use corsetry to create an &quot;hour-glass&quot; figure.

During the 1909–10 season she sang with Oscar Hammerstein&#x27;s Manhattan Opera Company. Her first marriage long over, she had a whirlwind romance with Robert Winthrop Chanler (1872–1930), a member of the Astor family and Dudley–Winthrop family. They married on 18 June 1910 but separated by the end of their honeymoon, and their divorce became final in June 1912.

After the divorce, Cavalieri returned to Europe where she became a much-loved star in pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg, Russia. Other operas in her repertoire included &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Manon&quot;, &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, &quot;Thaïs&quot;, &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; (as the courtesan Giulietta), &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Mefistofele&quot; (as both Margarita and Elena), &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Hérodiade&quot; (as Salomé), &quot;Carmen&quot; (the title role), &quot;Siberia&quot;, and &quot;Zazà&quot;.
During her career, Cavalieri sang with other prominent singers, including Giuseppe Anselmi, Mary Garden (the world premiere of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Chérubin&quot;, 1905), Mattia Battistini, Titta Ruffo, Feodor Chaliapin, Nikolay Figner, Antonio Scotti, Vanni Marcoux, Giovanni Zenatello, Tito Schipa, and the French tenor Lucien Muratore, whom she married in 1913 after his divorce from soprano Marguerite Bériza. After retiring from the stage, Cavalieri ran a cosmetic salon in Paris. In 1914, on the eve of her fortieth birthday – her beauty still spectacular – she wrote an advice column on make-up for women in &quot;Femina&quot; magazine and published a book, &quot;My Secrets of Beauty&quot;. In her Parisian Institut de Beauté, she licensed Parfums Isabey Paris and not only sold Isabey perfumes, but developed in 1926 a range of beauty products. The same year, she launched her own perfume, called &quot;Mona Lina&quot;, apparently inspired by Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. In 1915, she returned to her native Italy to make motion pictures. 

When that country became involved in World War I, she went to the United States, where she made four more silent films. The last three of her films were the product of her friend, the film director Edward José. Almost all of her films are considered lost.

After marrying her fourth husband, Paolo d&#x27;Arvanni, she returned to live with her husband in Italy. Well into her sixties when World War II began, she nevertheless worked as a volunteer nurse. 

Cavalieri was killed on 7 February 1944 during an Allied bombing raid that destroyed her home in Florence near Poggio Imperiale, where she had been placed under police surveillance because of her foreign husband. Hearing an American bomber nearby, Cavalieri, her husband, and the servants ran to the air-raid shelter in the grounds, but Cavalieri and her husband were delayed because they were collecting her valuable jewellery from the house. Both Cavalieri and her husband were killed running to the air-raid shelter, while the servants inside the shelter all survived.

== Legacy ==
Lina Cavalieri&#x27;s discography is rather slim. In 1910, for Columbia, she recorded arias from &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, and &quot;Faust&quot;, as well as &quot;Maria, Marì! (Ah! Marì! Ah! Marì!).&quot; In 1913, also for Columbia, she recorded Italian songs. In 1918, for Pathé, the soprano recorded two songs, the aria from &quot;Hérodiade&quot;, and three duets with Muratore.

Her portrait was painted by the Italian artist Giovanni Boldini (acquired by Maurice de Rothschild) and by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury. The latter painting is now the property of the Metropolitan Opera, the gift of Nicholas Meredith Turner in memory of his wife, the soprano Jessica Dragonette. Hers is the inspiring beauty that appears in several works by Piero Fornasetti.

In 1955, Gina Lollobrigida portrayed Cavalieri in a movie of Cavalieri&#x27;s life, &quot;Beautiful But Dangerous&quot; (also known as &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Woman&quot;). In 2004, a book was published, written by Paul Fryer and Olga Usova, titled &quot;Lina Cavalieri: The Life of Opera’s Greatest Beauty, 1874–1944&quot;.

==Family==
From her relationship to Alexandre Bariatinsky, Lina had one son, Alexandre Bariatinsky, Jr. He was serving in the Italian Army early in WW1 when she went to the authorities trying to find him.

<doc id="850097" wikidata="Q7331496" url="?curid=850097" title="Rick Jones (television presenter)">
<text>Frederick Joseph Jones (7 February 1937 – 7 October 2021) was a Canadian-born television presenter and folk musician, best known for his work in BBC children&#x27;s television programmes &quot;Play School&quot; (1964–1973) and &quot;Fingerbobs&quot; in 1972.

==Life and career==
Jones was born on 7 February 1937, in London, Ontario, Canada. His father was Frederick Jones, who served in the Canadian Army, and his mother was Agnes (née Hanson), who had both emigrated from Britain. He had an older sister who died in 2020 from COVID-19. A cousin whose parents had died also lived with them.

He moved to the UK at the age of 18 to study at the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art. He began his television career as one of the original co-presenters of &quot;Play School&quot;, a daily programme for pre-school-age children, in which he played guitar and sang. While Jones was appearing in &quot;Spoon River&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in 1964, the programme&#x27;s producer Joy Whitby invited him to join the cast. In 1972, he became the host of &quot;Fingerbobs&quot;, another show for younger children, in which he created characters from finger puppets made of paper. He also wrote and performed the English theme for the French TV series &quot;The Aeronauts&quot;.

He was one of several entertainers who took turns to present &quot;We Want To Sing&quot;, a musical variety series made by BBC Manchester, in which a young live audience was invited to sing along with songs performed by the host and various guests such as The New Seekers, The Settlers, and cabaret trio The New Faces. Other BBC TV programmes in which he appeared included &quot;Watch&quot; and &quot;Play Away&quot;.

His 1972 song &quot;Saskatchewan Sunrise&quot; reached #26 on the Canadian charts, May 20, 1972.

In 2012 Jones revealed the widespread use of marijuana on the show &quot;Play School&quot; after Johnny Ball, another presenter, alleged that Jones and Lionel Morton, were &quot;stoned out of their minds&quot; before filming in the 1970s. In an interview for &quot;The Sun&quot; Jones said that the BBC was &quot;really liberal&quot; at the time, explaining &quot;Once you were in all laws were forgotten. I had a wonderful time... Marijuana was like cornflakes.&quot; Having been fired by the BBC, after a fan sent him two cannabis spliffs at the corporation&#x27;s address, Jones subsequently had success as a musician (keyboards/vocals) fronting the British country rock band Meal Ticket. Songs featuring him included &quot;Snow&quot;, &quot;Last Port of Call&quot;, and &quot;Laughing Daughter&quot;. The song &quot;Better Believe it Babe&quot; featured as the theme for the BBC television &quot;Play for Today&quot; episode &quot;The Flipside of Dominick Hide&quot; (1980) and its sequel &quot;Another Flip for Dominick&quot; (1982). After Meal Ticket broke up, Jones wrote and appeared in the musical &quot;Flash Fearless vs. The Zorg Women&quot; in Los Angeles. In 2001, he reunited with Meal Ticket for a one-off gig at a London pub.

Jones latterly lived in San Francisco, United States, with his wife, Valerie. In collaboration with Roger Penycate, he wrote a stage musical based on the songs and lyrics of Meal Ticket (originally written by Rick Jones and Dave Pierce) entitled &quot;Laughing Daughter&quot;. It had a three-week run at the Indian Head Center for the Arts, Southern Maryland, United States, from 3 September 2009.

==Illness and death ==
He died from oesophageal cancer on 7 October 2021 at the age of 84, in San Francisco, California. He is survived by his wife and daughters.

<doc id="850102" wikidata="Q7144757" url="?curid=850102" title="Pathfinder Badge (United States)">
<text>The Pathfinder Badge is a military badge of the United States Army awarded to soldiers who complete the U.S. Army Sabalauski Air Assault School&#x27;s Pathfinder Course or the Army National Guard, Warrior Training Center, Mobile Training Team&#x27;s Pathfinder Course at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

To be awarded the Pathfinder Badge, the soldier must complete Pathfinder instruction in advanced land navigation, advanced scouting, tactical air traffic control in the field, and the control of parachute operations; the badge is awarded on completing several examinations under field training exercise (FTX) conditions. Examinations include proficiency in sling load rigging and execution, planning and execution of helicopter landing zones (HLZ), air traffic control operations, aerial delivery of troops and supplies, and several others.

The first Pathfinder Badge was designed by Lt. Prescott, a navigator in the 9th Troop Carrier Pathfinder Group (Provisional), in May 1944. Besides the paratroopers who earned it, the Pathfinder Badge was worn by IX Troop Carrier Command air crews who guided paratrooper transports and towed gliders. It was worn four inches above the left sleeve cuff on the service coat.

The current Pathfinder Badge, originally made of felt, was approved on 22 May 1964. The badge began being made of enameled metal on 11 October 1968. The badge&#x27;s wings symbolize flight and airborne capabilities, while the torch represents leadership and guidance. The torch traces back to the Olympians who carried the torch each year of the event to its location. US Army Pathfinders traditionally were the first to arrive ahead of larger elements to scout and designate areas in which aviation assets could perform their operations during combat.

<doc id="850105" wikidata="Q195216" url="?curid=850105" title="Black Tom explosion">
<text>The Black Tom explosion was an act of arson by field agents of the Office of Naval Intelligence of the German Empire, to destroy U.S.-made munitions that were about to be shipped to the Allies during World War I. The explosions occurred on July 30, 1916, in New York Harbor, killing at least 7 people and wounding hundreds more. It also caused damage of military goods worth some $20,000,000 ($ million in 2025 dollars). This incident, which happened prior to U.S. entry into World War I, also damaged the Statue of Liberty. It is one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions in history.

== Black Tom Island ==

The term &quot;Black Tom&quot; originally referred to an island in New York Harbor next to Liberty Island, named for a &quot;dark-skinned&quot; fisherman who inhabited the island for many years. The island was artificial, created by land fill around a rock of the same name, which had been a local hazard to navigation. Being largely built up from city refuse, it developed a reputation as an unseemly environmental hazard. The island was the site of two different explosions. The first occurred on January 26, 1875, when an accidental explosion in a powder factory killed four people. The more famous and deadly explosion occurred on July 30, 1916. By 1880, the island was transformed into a promontory, and a causeway and railroad had been built to connect it with the mainland to use as a shipping depot. Between 1905 and 1916, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, which owned the island and causeway, expanded the island with land fill, and the entire area was annexed by Jersey City. A -long pier on the island housed a depot and warehouses for the National Dock and Storage Company. Black Tom Island is now part of Liberty State Park.

Black Tom was a major munitions depot for the northeastern United States. Until April 6, 1917, the United States was neutral in respect to World War I and its munitions companies earlier in the war could sell to any buyer. Due to the blockade of Germany by the Royal Navy, however, only the Allied Governments were able to purchase American munitions. As a result, Imperial Germany sent spies to the United States to disrupt by any means necessary the production and delivery of war munitions that were intended to kill German soldiers on the battlefields of the Great War.

== Explosion ==
On the night of the Black Tom explosion, July 30, 1916, about of small arms and artillery ammunition were stored at the depot in freight cars and on barges, including of TNT on Johnson Barge No. 17. All were waiting to be shipped to Russia. Jersey City&#x27;s Commissioner of Public Safety, Frank Hague, later said he had been told the barge was &quot;tied up at Black Tom to avoid a twenty-five dollar charge&quot;.

After midnight, a series of small fires were discovered on the pier. Some guards fled, fearing an explosion. Others attempted to fight the fires and eventually called the Jersey City Fire Department. At 2:08 am, the first and largest of the explosions took place, the second and smaller explosion occurring around 2:40 am. A notable location for one of the first major explosions was around the Johnson Barge No. 17, which contained 50 tons of TNT and 417 cases of detonating fuses. The explosion created a detonation wave that traveled at with enough force to lift firefighters out of their boots and into the air.

Fragments from the explosion traveled long distances: some lodged in the Statue of Liberty, and other fragments lodged in the clock tower of &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot; building in Journal Square more than away, stopping the clock at 2:12 am. The explosion was the equivalent of an earthquake measuring between 5.0 and 5.5 on the Richter scale and was felt as far away as Philadelphia. Windows were broken as far as away, including thousands in Lower Manhattan. Some window panes in Times Square were shattered. The stained glass windows in St. Patrick&#x27;s Church were destroyed. The outer wall of Jersey City&#x27;s City Hall was cracked and the Brooklyn Bridge was shaken. People as far away as Maryland were awakened by what they thought was an earthquake.

Property damage from the attack was estimated at . On the island, the explosion destroyed more than one hundred railroad cars, thirteen warehouses, and left a crater at the source of the explosion. The damage to the Statue of Liberty was estimated to be , and included damage to the skirt and torch.

There were several reported fatalities in the explosion: the barge captain, Jersey City Police Department officer James F. Doherty, Lehigh Valley Railroad chief of police Joseph Leyden, and ten-week-old infant Arthur Tosson. One contemporary newspaper report estimated as many as seven deaths in the attack. Immigrants being processed at Ellis Island had to be evacuated to Manhattan Island.

== Investigation ==

Soon after the explosion, two watchmen who had lit smudge pots to keep away mosquitoes were questioned by police but the police soon determined that the smudge pots had not caused the fire and that the blast had likely been an accident. President Wilson remarked of the incident that it was &quot;a regrettable incident at a private railroad terminal&quot;, and Edgar E. Clark of the Interstate Commerce Commission was dispatched to investigate.

Soon afterward, a Slovak immigrant named Michael Kristoff was suspected, Kristoff would later serve in the United States Army in World War I, but admitted to working for German agents (transporting suitcases) in 1915 and 1916 while the U.S. was still neutral. According to Kristoff, two of the guards at Black Tom were German agents. 

It is likely that the bombing involved some of the techniques developed by German agents working for Ambassador Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, who acted covertly as a spymaster while using German Foreign Office cover, and Captain Franz von Rintelen of the intelligence wing of the German Imperial Navy, using the cigar bombs developed by Dr. . Von Rintelen used many resources at his disposal, including a large amount of money. Von Rintelen used these resources to make generous cash bribes, one of which was notably given to Michael Kristoff in exchange for access to the pier. German intelligence operatives Kurt Jahnke and Lothar Witzke were then suspected, and are still judged as responsible legally. It is also believed that Michael Kristoff, a 23-year-old Austrian immigrant who had served in the U.S. Army, was responsible for planting and initiating the incendiary devices that caused the explosions.

Additional investigation by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence also found links to some members of the Irish republican Clan na Gael organization and far-left organizations. Irish socialist and labour union leader James Larkin asserted that he had not participated with sabotage, but admitted to having encouraged work stoppages and strike actions in munitions factories, in an affidavit to McCloy in 1934.

The United States did not have an established national intelligence service, other than diplomats and a few military and naval attaches, making the investigation difficult. Without a formal intelligence service, the United States only had rudimentary communications security and no federal laws forbidding espionage or sabotage except during wartime, making the associations with the saboteurs and accomplices almost impossible to track.

== Aftermath ==
This attack was one of many during the German sabotage campaign against the neutral United States, and it is notable for its contribution to the shift of public opinion against Germany, which eventually resulted in American approval for participating with World War I.

The Russian government sued the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company operating the Black Tom Terminal on grounds that lax security (there was no entrance gate; the territory was unlit) permitted the loss of their ammunition and argued that due to the failure to deliver them the manufacturer was obliged by the contract to replace them.

After the war, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, advised by John J. McCloy, sought damages against Germany by the Treaty of Berlin from the German-American Mixed Claims Commission. The Mixed Claims Commission declared in 1939 that Imperial Germany had been responsible and awarded $50 million (the largest claim) in damages, which Nazi Germany refused to pay. The issue was finally settled in 1953 for $95 million (interest included) with the Federal Republic of Germany. The final payment was made in 1979.

The Statue of Liberty&#x27;s torch was closed to the public after the explosion, due to structural damage. Access was not opened even after the 1984–1986 restoration which included repairs to the arm and installation of a new gold-plated copper torch.

Kurt Jahnke escaped capture. He later served as an Abwehr agent during World War II. Jahnke worked as intelligence advisor to Walter Schellenberg. He and his wife were captured by Soviet SMERSH agents in April 1945 and interrogated. In 1950, Jahnke was put on trial as a spy, found guilty, and executed the same day.

Witzke was arrested at the Mexican border on February 1, 1918, near Nogales, Arizona. Officials were not prosecuted for the bombing, but prosecuted him as a spy. A military court at Fort Sam Houston found him guilty of espionage and sentenced him to death by hanging. While in custody, he tried to escape twice, once succeeding, but he was recaptured the same day. On November 2, 1918, Witzke&#x27;s death sentence was approved by the Department Commander. However, he was not executed because of the November Armistice. In May 1920, President Woodrow Wilson commuted Witzke&#x27;s sentence to life in prison. In September 1923, Witzke, as a result of heroic conduct in prison and pressure for his release by the Weimar Republic, was pardoned by President Calvin Coolidge, and deported to Germany. Upon his arrival, Witzke was awarded the Iron Cross, First and Second Class, by the Reichswehr. Witzke later joined the Abwehr, and after World War II, lived in Hamburg. He was a monarchist who represented the German Party in the Hamburg Parliament from 1949 to 1952. Witzke died in 1961.

Kristoff was arrested by the Jersey City police on suspicion of involvement in the blast, but later released due to a lack of evidence. Over the next several years, he drifted in and out of prison for various crimes. Kristoff died of tuberculosis in 1928.

The Black Tom explosion resulted in the establishment of domestic intelligence agencies for the United States. The then Police Commissioner of New York, Arthur Woods, argued, &quot;The lessons to America are clear as day. We must not again be caught napping with no adequate national intelligence organization. The several federal bureaus should be welded into one and that one should be eternally and comprehensively vigilant.&quot; The explosion also played a role in how future presidents responded to military conflict. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the Black Tom explosion as part of his rationale for the internment of Japanese Americans after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. In an interview with Jules Witcover, McCloy noted that as assistant secretary of the navy for President Wilson, Roosevelt &quot;knew all about Black Tom&quot;. At the time President Roosevelt said to him: &quot;We don&#x27;t want any more Black Toms&quot;.

The incident also influenced public safety legislation. The sabotage techniques used by Germany, and the United States&#x27; declaration of war on Germany, resulted in the creation of the Espionage Act, which passed by Congress in late 1917. Landfill projects later made Black Tom Island part of the mainland, and it was incorporated into Liberty State Park. The former Black Tom Island is at the end of Morris Pesin Drive in the southeastern corner of the park, where a plaque marks the spot of the explosion. A circle of U.S. flags complements the plaque, which stands east of the visitors&#x27; facility.

The inscription on the plaque reads:

Explosion at Liberty!

On July 30, 1916 the Black Tom munitions depot exploded rocking New York Harbor and sending residents tumbling from their beds.

The noise of the explosion was heard as far away as Maryland and Connecticut. On Ellis Island, terrified immigrants were evacuated by ferry to the Battery. Shrapnel pierced the Statue of Liberty (the arm of the Statue was closed to visitors after this). Property damage was estimated at $20 million. It is not known how many died.

Why the explosion? Was it an accident or planned? According to historians, the Germans sabotaged the Lehigh Valley munitions depot in order to stop deliveries being made to the British who had blockaded the Germans in Europe.

You are walking on a site which saw one of the worse [sic] acts of terrorism in American history.
A stained-glass window at Our Lady of Czestochowa Catholic church memorialized the victims of the attack.

<doc id="850107" wikidata="Q1434146" url="?curid=850107" title="Fluid and crystallized intelligence">
<text>The concepts of fluid intelligence (g&quot;f) andcrystallized intelligence(g&quot;c) were introduced in 1943 by the psychologist Raymond Cattell. According to Cattell&#x27;s psychometrically-based theory, general intelligence (&quot;g&quot;) is subdivided into &quot;g&quot;f and &quot;g&quot;c. Fluid intelligence is the ability to solve novel reasoning problems and is correlated with a number of important skills such as comprehension, problem-solving, and learning. Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, involves the ability to deduce secondary relational abstractions by applying previously learned primary relational abstractions.

== History ==
Fluid and crystallized intelligence are constructs originally conceptualized by Raymond Cattell. The concepts of fluid and crystallized intelligence were further developed by Cattell and his former student John L. Horn. Most of the intelligence testing had mainly been focused on children, and young adults. Cattell and Horn wanted to see how intelligence changed and developed when aging took place on an individual. They realized that while some memories and concepts remained, others diminished. Thus, there was a need to delineate two types of intelligence.

== Fluid versus crystallized intelligence ==
Fluid intelligence (&quot;g&quot;f) involved basic processes of reasoning and other mental activities that depend only minimally on prior learning (such as formal and informal education) and acculturation. Horn notes that it is formless and can &quot;flow into&quot; a wide variety of cognitive activities. Tasks measuring fluid reasoning require the ability to solve abstract reasoning problems. Examples of tasks that measure fluid intelligence include figure classifications, figural analyses, number and letter series, matrices, and paired associates.

Crystallized intelligence (&quot;g&quot;c) includes learned procedures and knowledge. It reflects the effects of experience and acculturation. Horn notes that crystallized ability is a &quot;precipitate out of experience,&quot; resulting from the prior application of fluid ability that has been combined with the intelligence of culture. Examples of tasks that measure crystallized intelligence are vocabulary, general information, abstract word analogies, and the mechanics of language.

=== Example application of fluid and crystallized abilities to problem-solving ===
Horn provided the following example of crystallized and fluid approaches to solving a problem. Here is the problem he described:

&quot;There are 100 patients in a hospital. Some (an even number) are one-legged but wearing shoes. One-half of the remainder are barefooted. How many shoes are being worn?&quot;

The crystallized approach to solving the problem would involve the application of high school-level algebra. Algebra is an acculturational product.

formula_1 is the number of shoes worn, where equals the number of one-legged patients. formula_2 equals the number of two-legged patients. The solution boils down to 100 shoes.

In contrast to the crystallized approach to solving the problem, Horn provided a made-up example of a fluid approach to solving the problem, an approach that does not depend on the learning of high school-level algebra. In his made-up example, Horn described a boy who is too young to attend secondary school but could solve the problem through the application of fluid ability: &quot;He may reason that if half the two-legged people are without shoes, and all the rest (an even number) are one-legged, then the shoes must average one per person, and the answer is 100.&quot;

== Relationship to Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development ==
Researchers have linked the theory of fluid and crystallized abilities to Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development. Fluid ability and Piaget&#x27;s operative intelligence both concern logical thinking and the &quot;eduction of relations&quot; (an expression Cattell used to refer to the inferring of relationships). Crystallized ability and Piaget&#x27;s treatment of everyday learning reflects the impress of experience. Like fluid ability&#x27;s relation to crystallized intelligence, Piaget&#x27;s operativity is considered to be prior to, and ultimately provides the foundation for, everyday learning.

== Measurement of fluid intelligence ==
Various measures have been thought to assess fluid intelligence.

=== Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices ===
The Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices (RPM) is one of the most commonly used measures of fluid ability. It is a non-verbal multiple-choice test. Participants have to complete a series of drawings by identifying relevant features based on the spatial organization of an array of objects and choosing one object that matches one or more of the identified features. This task assesses the ability to consider one or more relationships between mental representations or &quot;relational reasoning.&quot; &quot;Propositional analogies&quot; and semantic decision tasks are also used to assess relational reasoning.

=== Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, Third Edition ===
In the Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, Third Edition (WJ-III), &quot;g&quot;f is assessed by two tests: Concept Formation and Analysis Synthesis. Concept Formation tasks require the individual to use categorical thinking; Analysis Synthesis tasks require general sequential reasoning.

==== Concept Formation ====
Individuals have to apply concepts by inferring the underlying &quot;rules&quot; for solving visual puzzles that are presented with increasing levels of difficulty. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals have to identify a key difference (or the &quot;rule&quot;) for solving puzzles involving one-to-one comparisons. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of &quot;and&quot; (e.g., a solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of &quot;or&quot; (e.g., to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee had worked with previously.

==== Analysis–Synthesis ====
In the Analysis–Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual has presented a set of logic rules, a &quot;key&quot; that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items presented puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to deriving a final solution. Increasingly difficult items involve a mix of puzzles that requires fluid shifts in deduction, logic, and inference.

=== Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, Fourth Edition ===
The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) is used to have an overall measure in cognitive ability with five primary indexing scores. In the WISC-IV, the Perceptual Reasoning Index contains two subtests that assess &quot;g&quot;f: Matrix Reasoning, which involves induction and deduction, and Picture Concepts, which involves induction. 

==== Picture Concepts ====
In the Picture Concepts task, children are presented with a series of pictures on two or three rows and asked which pictures (one from each row) belong together based on some common characteristic. This task assesses the child&#x27;s ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g., rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials.

==== Matrix Reasoning ====
Matrix Reasoning also assesses this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children have presented with a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task requires the child to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they have been considered to be non-verbal tests of &quot;g&quot;f.

=== In the workplace ===
Within the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person&#x27;s capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. The Cognitive Process Profile (CPP) measures a person&#x27;s fluid intelligence and cognitive processes. It maps these against suitable work environments according to Elliott Jaques&#x27;s Stratified Systems Theory. Fe et al. (2022) show that fluid intelligence measured in childhood predicts labor market earnings.

=== Factors related to measuring intelligence ===
Some authors have suggested that unless an individual is truly interested in a problem presented on an IQ test, the cognitive work required to solve the problem may not be performed owing to a lack of interest. These authors have contended that a low score on tests that are intended to measure fluid intelligence may reflect more of a lack of interest in the tasks than an inability to complete the tasks successfully.

== Development across life span ==
Fluid intelligence peaks at around age 27 and then gradually declines. This decline may be related to local atrophy of the brain in the right cerebellum, a lack of practice, or the result of age-related changes in the brain.

Crystallized intelligence typically increases gradually, stays relatively stable across most of adulthood, and then begins to decline after age 65. The exact peak age of cognitive skills remains elusive.

== Fluid intelligence and working memory ==
Working memory capacity is closely related to fluid intelligence, and has been proposed to account for individual differences in &quot;g&quot;f. The linking of working memory and &quot;g&quot;f has been suggested that it could help resolve mysteries that have puzzled researchers concerning the two concepts.

=== Neuroanatomy ===
According to David Geary, &quot;g&quot;f and &quot;g&quot;c can be traced to two separate brain systems. Fluid intelligence involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and other systems related to attention and short-term memory. Crystallized intelligence appears to be a function of brain regions that involve the storage and usage of long-term memories, such as the hippocampus.

=== Research on training working memory and the training&#x27;s indirect effect on fluid ability ===
Because working memory is thought to influence &quot;g&quot;f, then training to increase the capacity of working memory could have a positive impact on &quot;g&quot;f. Some researchers, however, question whether the results of training interventions to enhance &quot;g&quot;f are long-lasting and transferable, especially when these techniques are used by healthy children and adults without cognitive deficiencies. A meta-analytical review published in 2012 concluded that &quot;memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize.&quot;

In a series of four individual experiments involving 70 participants (mean age of 25.6) from the University of Bern community, Jaeggi et al. found that, in comparison to a demographically matched control group, healthy young adults who practiced a demanding working memory task (dual n-back) approximately 25 minutes per day for between 8 and 19 days had significantly greater pre-to-posttest increases in their scores on a matrix test of fluid intelligence. There was no long-term follow-up to assess how enduring the effects of training were.

Two later n-back studies did not support the findings of Jaeggi et al. Although participants&#x27; performance on the training task improved, these studies showed no significant improvement in the mental abilities tested, especially fluid intelligence and working memory capacity.

Thus the balance of findings suggests that training for the purpose of increasing working memory can have specific short-term effects but no effects on &quot;g&quot;f.

<text>Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta (; 11 November 1771 – 20 July 1851) was a French general, diplomat, and politician, who served as Naval Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of State under the July Monarchy.

Having joined the French Revolutionary Army in his youth, Sébastiani rose through its ranks before becoming a supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte. Sébastiani was the French Consulate&#x27;s emissary to The Levant, notably drafting plans to reconquer Ottoman Egypt, and later served as the Empire&#x27;s Ambassador to The Porte. In the latter capacity, he attempted to increase French influence and signaled pro-Russian activities in the Danubian Principalities, thus provoking the War of 1806–1812. In 1807, Sébastiani organized the defense of Constantinople during the Dardanelles Operation. Recalled due to British pressure after the deposition of Selim III, he served in the Peninsular War and resided in the Alhambra, took part in the unsuccessful invasion of Russia, and defended the Champagne region in front of the Sixth Coalition.

Sébastiani recognized the Bourbon Restoration, but rallied with Napoleon during the Hundred Days, being elected to the Chamber for the first time in 1815. Briefly exiled after the return of King Louis XVIII, he was again admitted as a Deputy in 1819, sitting with the Left faction, supporting liberal politics, and coming into conflict with the Jean-Baptiste de Villèle Cabinet. After the July Revolution, he endorsed Louis-Philippe. Sébastiani&#x27;s time as Foreign Minister saw France&#x27;s involvement in the Belgian Revolution, its refusal to sanction the November Uprising, the controversial solution to a commercial dispute with the United States, and the French occupation of Ancona. In later years, he progressed in French Government service as an ambassador.

The 1847 murder of his daughter, Françoise, Duchess de Praslin indirectly helped spark the 1848 Revolution.

==Early life==
Born in La Porta, Corsica, Sébastiani was the son of a tailor and well-to-do craftsman, the nephew of Louis Sébastiani de La Porta, a Roman Catholic priest who was later Bishop of Ajaccio, and probably a distant relative of the Bonapartes. Horace Sébastiani had a brother, Tiburce, who rose to the rank of &quot;Maréchal de Camp&quot;. Initially destined for a religious career, he left his native island during the French Revolution, and entered the army in 1792. Briefly dispatched as a secretary to Conte Raffaele Cadorna in Casablanca, Sébastiani participated in the Revolutionary Wars, including campaigns in Corsica, 1793, the Alps, 1794–1797, and at the Battle of Marengo, 1800. Having served as an officer in the 9th Dragoon Regiment, he was promoted to colonel in 1799.
Sébastiani joined Lucien Bonaparte&#x27;s entourage, and endorsed Napoleon&#x27;s political actions, taking an active part in the 18 Brumaire coup (9 November 1799). In 1802, the Consulate sent him on his first diplomatic assignments in the Ottoman Empire, Ottoman Egypt, and other parts of The Levant. Among his first actions were the settlement of a conflict between Sweden and the Barbary State of Tripoli, as well as obtaining the latter&#x27;s agreement to recognize the Italian Republic.

==Mission to Egypt and 1805 Campaign==
Sébastiani negotiated with the British military commanders in the aftermath of the French invasion of Egypt (1798), asking them to abide by the newly signed Treaty of Amiens and withdraw from Alexandria; following this he met with Ottoman officials in Cairo, unsuccessfully offering to mediate between them and rebellious beys (&quot;see Muhammad Ali&#x27;s seizure of power&quot;). In late 1802, he traveled to Akka, and negotiated a trade agreement with the local pasha.

During this period, Sébastiani theorized that, despite Egyptian Campaign&#x27;s failure, the French could yet again establish their control over the region. He publicized this view in a report, published by &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot; on 30 January 1803, posing a threat for both British and Russian interests; this probably contributed to deescalating relations between the latter two over the prolonged British presence in Malta, with Henry Addington&#x27;s Cabinet indicating that British troops would remain as long as France held designs to invade Egypt.

Returning to France, he was put in charge of the littoral from the mouth of the Vilaine (in Morbihan) to Brest, before, in 1804, being despatched on a short mission to the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. Promoted Brigadier-General in 1803, he commanded &quot;Grande Armée&quot; troops during the Battle of Ulm. After leading a successful attack on Günzburg, Sébastiani followed the Austrians into Moravia (1805), having been promoted &quot;Général de division&quot; after the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, where he was wounded.

==Embassy to Selim III==

Appointed French Ambassador to The Porte on 12 April 1806, and gaining his post on 10 August, he attempted to convince Sultan Selim III to exclude the Royal Navy from access through the Dardanelles. According to a biographical essay published by the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; in 1833, Sébastiani faced almost universal hostility from the anti-French diplomatic corps—whose opinions were influenced by the Russian Count Andrei Yakovlevich Budberg and the British Ambassador Charles Arbuthnot. The same article claimed: &quot;France had for its allies only the envoys of Spain and Holland&quot;. Among Horace Sébastiani&#x27;s moves to enlist Ottoman support for Napoleon was the establishment of a printing press in Constantinople, which published works of French literature translated into Turkish and Arabic.

Sébastiani persuaded the Ottomans to take a stand against Russia after bringing attention to the anti-Ottoman conspiracy in Wallachia, formed around Prince Constantine Ypsilantis, as well as to the suspicious policies of Moldavia&#x27;s Prince Alexander Mourousis. According to the aristocratic Wallachian memoirist and politician Ion Ghica, Selim &quot;followed the advice of General Sébastiani, who tried to bring him to Napoleon&#x27;s side&quot;, and saw a connection between Ypsilantis and the Serbian Uprising:
The conflict itself started when Russia considered Ypsilantis&#x27; deposition to go against the letter of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and the Treaty of Jassy. While the Russian Count and Ambassador Arbuthnot prepared to leave Constantinople, The Porte convened to have the two Princes reinstated. Despite this, Russian troops under General Ivan Michelson and Count Mikhail Miloradovich entered the two Danubian Principalities (&quot;see Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)&quot;). Prince Ypsilantis had previously escaped to the Russian camp, and was briefly considered by his allies as ruler over both principalities (just before Russian occupation took over); the French Consul to Moldavia, Charles-Frédéric Reinhard, reportedly not informed of Sébastiani&#x27;s contacts with Selim, was arrested by the Russian troops. As a major consequence of this chain of events, France pulled the strings of Ottoman foreign policy.
During the parallel Anglo-Turkish War in 1807, Sébastiani helped the Ottomans in the successful defense of Constantinople against the British squadron of Admiral Duckworth. The British bombardment, coming at a time when the Muslim population was celebrating &quot;Eid al-Adha&quot;, was met with panic, and Sébastiani&#x27;s group of French military officers was soon the only organized force present on the European side. In his messages to Selim, Sir John Duckworth asked for the French ambassador to be removed, for the Ottoman fleet and the Dardanelles military facilities to be handed over, and for Russia to be granted rule over Wallachia and Moldavia. The Sultan sent envoys requesting Sébastiani to leave Ottoman territory, but the French Ambassador explained that he would not do so until being ordered by Selim himself.

As the matter was being debated, Janissary forces on the Anatolian shore organized themselves, and, once increased in strength, began responding to the attack. Selim subsequently asked Sébastiani and his men (including Louis Gustave le Doulcet and , as well as the embassy&#x27;s secretary ), to oversee Constantinople&#x27;s defense and the line of fire nearby Topkapı Palace, organizing maneuvers which caused Duckworth to withdraw.

In 1806, Sébastiani married Jeanne-Françoise-Antoinette (Fanny) , only daughter of François-Henri de Franquetot, marquis de Coigny). She died in childbirth while in Constantinople, just a few days before the Sultan was deposed (14 April 1807), and left Sébastiani a large fortune. Upon hearing news of her death, Sultan Selim transmitted condolences through his Grand Dragoman.

==Embassy to Mustafa IV==

The successful rebellion led by Kabakçı Mustafa and the Janissary troops put an end to French diplomatic success. Sébastiani negotiated with Kabakçı, while the British sought support from various factions inside Constantinople — the Grand Dragoman, , eventually informed the French Ambassador on the parallel British projects. This resulted in Soutzos&#x27; beheading — that which, in Ion Ghica&#x27;s version of events, caused the Soutzos family to abandon their commitment to France and begin supporting Russia. According to the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; biography, Sébastiani had betrayed Aleko Soutzos&#x27; confidence by revealing as many details of Anglo-Ottoman negotiations as to render it clear that the Dragoman had been acting as his spy, and by failing to respect the promise of French protection.

Under the new monarch, Mustafa IV, he attempted to impose a pro-French pasha as governor of Baghdad, and later provoked a scandal by asking for the Imperial Executioner, the &quot;Bostanji-bashi&quot;, to be demoted—this came after three Ragusan subjects, having been found guilty of theft, were subjected to the &quot;falaka&quot; torture, despite the facts that the recent annexation of Ragusa by France offered them a degree of immunity. As a result of his pressures, Sébastiani obtained rule over the province of Baghdad for his favorite, and, in return, allowed the &quot;Bostanji-bashi&quot; to remain in office.

He asked to be recalled in April 1807, being replaced by &quot;Chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; Faÿ de La Tour Maubourg. This departure was also prompted by renewed British requests. Shortly before his leaving, Sultan Mustafa awarded Sébastiani the Order of the Crescent 1st Class, which has been interpreted as a measure to alleviate the impact of British successes. According to other accounts, Mustafa himself had become deeply dissatisfied with Sébastiani&#x27;s interventions and policies. Upon his return to France, Sébastiani received the &quot;Grand Aigle de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;. The &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; speculated that, based on the Corsican heritage he shared with Sébastiani:
==Peninsular War and 1813 Campaign==

Sébastiani became a Count of the Empire, and commanded IV Corps in the Peninsular War, notably at the Battle of Ciudad-Real, the Battle of Talavera, and the Battle of Almonacid. In 1810, he took Linares, Jaén, Granada and Málaga. Troops under his command included a group of Polish &quot;émigré&quot; soldiers, among them Albert Grzymała, who served on his staff and was later noted for his friendship with Frédéric Chopin.

Starting from that date, Sébastiani gained a reputation for lacking leadership skills: popularly nicknamed &quot;General Surprise&quot; as a result of having been caught out by enemy troops a significant number of times, he was argued by Jean-Baptiste de Marbot to have been noted for nothing other than mediocrity. According to the 1833 &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;, he had also become known for his lassitude, to the point where Napoleon himself grew irate. The same source recounted that, after Talavera de la Reina and especially after Almonacid, the general raised suspicion that he wasted men and resources, systematically failed to report all his casualties, and seriously exaggerated the scale of his victories. It was contended that the Emperor eventually withdrew Sébastiani&#x27;s command of IV Corps after concluding that this assessment was correct.

Some sources claim that Sébastiani was created &quot;1st Duke of Murcia&quot; by Napoleon; according to the &quot;Revue&quot;, although nominated for the title by the new King of Spain, Joseph Bonaparte, Sébastiani was denied appointment by Napoleon (a gesture alleged to have itself been based on the General&#x27;s conduct at Almonacid). Nonetheless, it was reported that Sébastiani made use of the title for the rest of his participation in the Spanish expedition. The &quot;Revue&quot; claimed that the ducal title &quot;of Murcia&quot; was adopted by the General himself, after he reaped a minor victory in Lorca and reportedly advanced a project to gain the region back from guerrilla forces (the plan was to be discarded by Sébastiani&#x27;s commander, Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult).

Sébastiani is reported to have plundered a number of Roman Catholic convents during the Peninsular expedition. Having stationed his troops in the Alhambra, where he himself resided in noted luxury, Sébastiani partly destroyed the palace&#x27;s fortifications after retreating. It is argued that he was also responsible for the partial devastation of the palace&#x27;s interior. The American author Washington Irving, who visited Spain in the following period, recounted that: 
Serving during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia, under Marshal Joachim Murat, and in the Campaign of 1812–1813, he commanded a cavalry division, becoming noted in the battles of Borodino (being the first French commander to enter Moscow, but was later forced to retreat with heavy losses), Bautzen, Lützen, Leipzig (where he was wounded), and Hanau. After attempting to hold Cologne, he took part in the defense of French territory, holding a command position in Champagne and organizing troops in Châlons-en-Champagne. In March, he assisted in the retaking of Reims, where he faced the Imperial Russian Army troops under the command of Emmanuel de Saint-Priest.

==Hundred Days and Second Restoration==

Changing sides to support Talleyrand on 10 April 1814, Sébastiani was appointed to the Bourbon Restoration Government and was, on 2 June, awarded the Order of Saint Louis by King Louis XVIII. Nevertheless, upon news that Napoleon was returning from Elba, he abandoned his command and left for Paris, where, together with the Count de Lavalette, he organized National Guard detachments to assist the Emperor. Napoleon also sent him over to attract support from the liberal politician Benjamin Constant; soon after, Constant became involved in drafting the more permissive &quot;Acte Additionel&quot;, which amended the &quot;Constitution of the Year XII&quot;.

During the Hundred Days, he was assigned the reviewing of legislation passed by Louis XVIII, and organized the National Guard in Picardy. Sébastiani was elected to the Chamber for the department of Aisne. After the Battle of Waterloo, he voted in favor of Napoleon&#x27;s abdication, and, eventually, was among those assigned with negotiating a peace with the Seventh Coalition (as part of a delegation also comprising Benjamin Constant de Rebecque, the marquis de La Fayette, marquis d&#x27;Argenson and comte de Pontécoulant). During talks, he showed himself opposed to a second Bourbon return.

Sébastiani spent a year in England before being allowed to return (having retired from active service and receiving half pay). Starting in 1819, after being promoted by the Duke Decazes, he was a prominent member of the Chamber of Deputies, initially representing Corsica, rallying with the Left. According to the &quot;Revue&quot; comments, his political choice was unusual, reportedly astonishing both members of the Left and the moderate Decazes, a Royalist. Inside the Chamber, he joined forces with Maximilien Sebastien Foy, notably pushing projects to recognize the merits of &quot;Grande Armée&quot; veterans; a speech he held on the latter occasion, which gave praise to the French tricolor, caused an uproar among conservative deputies.

During the 1824 French legislative election, his attempt to campaign in Corsica was frustrated by the local authorities representing the Royalist Government of Jean-Baptiste de Villèle, and he subsequently won 1 out of 48 votes. Instead, after General Foy&#x27;s death in late 1825, he was elected as replacement in his constituency, the Aisne town of Vervins, receiving 120 votes out of 200.

==July Revolution and Belgian question==

After the July Revolution, he held the posts of Naval Minister under the nominal leadership of François Guizot (autumn 1830), and Foreign Affairs under Jacques Laffitte and Casimir Pierre Perier. During the Revolution, he parted with the Left, and made declarations in support of Charles X—including one which proclaimed that the only national flag was the white one for the Bourbons. Allegedly establishing links with the radical &quot;Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera&quot; society in the early days of the July Monarchy, he subsequently rallied with the centrist politics of the Orléanist camp. With Laffitte, Benjamin Constant, Jean-Guillaume Hyde de Neuville, Adolphe Thiers, and others, he played a prominent part in calling Louis-Philippe to the French throne.

After that, the Sébastianis became the most influential faction in Corsica, replacing the Legitimist Pozzo di Borgo family — one of the latter, Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo, was a high-ranking Russian diplomat who negotiated with Horace Sébastiani on several occasions.

In the wake of the Belgian Revolution, when candidatures were considered for the Belgian throne, Sébastiani had the task of undermining support for Auguste of Leuchtenberg and drawing allegiances for the Duke of Nemours. After Nemours refused the Belgian crown, he transferred French support to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the British-backed candidate, in exchange for Leopold&#x27;s agreeing to marry Louise-Marie of France. This policy was viewed as a capitulation by the Legitimists, and most notably by Jean Maximilien Lamarque, who, while deploring the separation of the French and the French-speaking Walloons, accused Sébastiani of having obtained the destruction of fortifications in Belgium not as a concession from other states, but rather because &quot;the allied powers want to set aside the means of entering France without running into obstacles&quot;.

When the London Conference compelled Dutch forces to evacuate Belgian territory, Sébastiani indicated that the French troops under General Gérard were to remain in the area until &quot;all reasons why the French Army has maneuvered would be dealt with resolutely, and no danger would threaten us&quot;. Nevertheless, Gérard retreated before the Conference came to an end. When Chamber called on the minister to answer about the discrepancy, he declared himself &quot;astonished&quot; by news of the retreat, attributing it to British pressures, and indicated that &quot;we have entered Belgium in good will; good will is what led us to withdraw&quot;.

==November Uprising: early negotiations==

In late 1830, after the November Uprising broke out in Congress Poland, Sébastiani, despite the revolutionaries&#x27; expectations, chose to avoid his country&#x27;s involvement. As Russian troops carried out a violent intervention against the rebellion, a deputy in the Sejm lamented that Poland was perishing without having even seen a French courier; the minister responded to similar accusations at home by stating that France was determined not to raise the anger of Emperor Nicholas. Nevertheless, some time after the Uprising erupted, Sébastiani received Polish envoys with sympathy, and had felt secure that &quot;a friendly arrangement with Russia&quot; could be achieved. To this end, he sent a mission to Saint Petersburg, which attempted to mediate an understanding between the Polish revolutionaries and Russia; in order to undermine communications between France and Poland, the government of Viktor Kochubey took the decision of recognizing the July Monarchy, which it had refused to do until then. In January 1831, after pressures from the Marquis de La Fayette, the Duke of Mortemart was dispatched to Russia in order to seek a new agreement—his mission was made ineffectual by the revolutionaries&#x27; decision to dethrone Nicholas from his position as King of Poland, which in turn led to a standoff between all sides involved.

In parallel, Sébastiani allegedly approved the designs of Armand Charles Guilleminot, the Ambassador to The Porte, who attempted to undermine the Holy Alliance by stressing that Russian actions in Poland and the Balkans could rally opposition from Austria, the Ottoman Empire and the United Kingdom. Guilleminot ultimately presented the Ottomans with an offer to back an independent Poland—as a consequence, Foreign Minister Sébastiani was formally asked by Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo to recall the ambassador, and he ultimately agreed to do so.

Historian Barthélemy Hauréau indicated that the moderate path pursued by Sébastiani had been largely responsible for convincing Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki to postpone military operations, to the point where it was later contended that the minister was plotting with Russian authorities. He referred to Sébastiani&#x27;s position as &quot;a miserable role&quot;, and to his correspondence with the Poles as &quot;perfidious epistles&quot;.

==November Uprising: aftermath==

When Poland was ultimately pacified, Sébastiani uttered the famous words: 
The statement itself was not rendered verbatim by the &quot;Moniteur&quot;, allegedly due to their potential for causing scandal. As Sébastiani&#x27;s words began circulating freely, public opinion considered them evidence of callousness, and, in December, they were used by J. J. Grandville as title for a cartoon showing the effects of repression in Congress Poland. Another of Grandville&#x27;s drawings, depicting the authorities&#x27; violent response to public manifestations of support for Polish revolutionaries, was titled &quot;Public Order Reigns Also in Paris&quot; (sold together, the two works caused the artist to be censored and his house to be raided by policemen). It was also contended that the statement had been made by Sébastiani with the specific goal of persuading Russia that France did not condemn the intervention — reportedly, Emperor Nicholas normalized relations with France and received its ambassador, the Duke of Trévise, only after hearing news of Sébastiani&#x27;s speech.

Later, he justified himself in front of the Chamber by arguing that intervention in Poland was doomed to failure, noting that a French landing on Poland&#x27;s Baltic shore was made impossible by both distance and the minor scale of facilities in Polangen. When interpellated in the Chamber, he also contended that France had managed to obtain consensus that Russia was to maintain a degree of Polish autonomy, as these had been stipulated by the 1814–1814 Congress of Vienna. Reflecting upon public sentiment at a time when Radicalism had become a European phenomenon, he was also quoted saying:


During a Chamber session in September 1831, the liberal Marquis de La Fayette publicly accused the Laffitte cabinet in general and Sébastiani in particular of having secretly encouraged the Poles while persuading them to delay their attack on Russian troops (allegedly promising that France would give them official backing following that moment, and later forfeiting the pledge). La Fayette also stressed that it was possible for France to sanction Polish independence, especially since the Holy Alliance appeared to have been divided on the issue. According to Karl Marx, when Sébastiani defended his ministry and stressed that he had not made Poland any promises, the Marquis confronted him with a letter signed by Karol Kniaziewicz, dated September 1830, which contained references to Sébastiani&#x27;s guarantees and his call to postpone the offensive. The &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; recounted that the diplomat Talleyrand and Sébastiani both maintained an independent line in politics—their secretive notes reportedly contributed to the fall of the Laffitte government.

==Périer Cabinet==
Over the following year, he and Prime Minister Périer were called upon by the Marquis de La Fayette to express disapproval for reactionary politics in the Austrian Empire, and to allow Italian Carbonari refugees such as Cristina Trivulzio di Belgiojoso to remain on French territory. La Fayette noted that Sébastiani had undertaken:
In February 1832, Sébastiani took initiative in ordering a French occupation of Ancona. The &quot;Revue&quot; argued that this was the most significant gesture of his career, and credited him with having planned it as an indirect but effective strike at Austrian economic interests, when implying that France would march into Rome and Trieste in the event of a war with Austria.

Among his last actions in office as Foreign Minister were negotiations with the United States over losses suffered by American citizens during the Napoleon&#x27;s Continental Blockade, when several ships bearing the American flag were arrested in European ports, on suspicion that they were in fact serving British commercial interests (&quot;see Embargo Act of 1807&quot;). Raising much controversy, he set the sum France agreed to pay at 25 million francs, 10 million more than what committees of the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; and Chamber had decided, although still significantly less than what had been asked by American plaintiffs.

It was during the same period that Sébastiani remarried, to Aglaé-Angélique-Gabrielle de Gramont, one of Héraclius, duc de Gramont&#x27;s daughters and the widow of the Russian General Count Alexander Davidoff. He retired from office after having a stroke which left him partly paralyzed, and traveled in the Italian Peninsula. He was later Minister of State for a short period of time.

==Later years==
In 1833, Sébastiani was ambassador to the Two Sicilies, and in 1835–1840, to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He was recalled and replaced by François Guizot after refusing, against his government wishes, to support the cause of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s design to extend his rule out of the Egyptian realm by conquering Ottoman lands in Syria (&quot;see London Straits Convention&quot;). Adolphe Thiers later pointed out that he agreed with Sébastiani&#x27;s view, which he defined as:
During the ministerial crisis provoked by the fall of the Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult cabinet, before Thiers&#x27; nomination, Sébastiani was considered for the office of Premier; his failure to gain the position was attributed to rejection from all political camps, based on the view that he was overtly subservient to King Louis-Philippe.

He was made Marshal of France in 1840, replacing the deceased Nicolas Joseph Maison, and represented Ajaccio in the Chamber for several terms. He became a Peer of France in 1842. The &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;&#x27; François Buloz announced, in April 1835, that Vicomte Tiburce Sébastiani was involved in heated disputes with other public figures, over repeated allegations that his brother had harmed French interests in the American creditors&#x27; affair. In this and other cases of the period, the same controversy almost erupted into duels.

Having largely retired from public life, he had his last years clouded by the 1847 death of his sole daughter from his first marriage, Fanny, duchess of Choiseul-Praslin. Fanny had married Charles, duc de Praslin, in 1825. In what was one of the most famous murders of the 19th century, the duchess had been stabbed repeatedly and with noted violence. For long before her death, Fanny had accused Charles de Choiseul-Praslin of having cheated on her and of having separated her from her children. Her killing was thought to be a consequence of the Duke&#x27;s plan to run away with their children&#x27;s governess. Arrested and waiting to be tried by the Court of Peers, Choiseul-Praslin was released on parole, only to commit suicide on 24 August 1847; shortly before his death, he denied all charges. This event played a part in bringing about the 1848 Revolution, after public opinion began speculating that aristocrats had allowed one of their own to take his own life rather than face trial, or even that Choiseul-Praslin had been allowed to escape. As a parallel result, the 1848 events brought an end to the Sébastianis&#x27; influence in Corsica, especially after Tiburce Sébastiani chose to retire to his domain in Olmeta-di-Tuda.

Four years later, Sébastiani died suddenly while having breakfast. His funeral service was held at Les Invalides and attended by President Charles-Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte among other officials of the Second Republic.

==Legacy==
Horace Sébastiani&#x27;s name is inscribed on the western side of the Arc de Triomphe. An avenue in Bastia was named in his honor (&quot;Avenue Maréchal Sébastiani&quot;).

In 1938, Rachel Field published her &quot;All This and Heaven Too&quot;, a novel which centers on the killing of Sébastiani&#x27;s daughter. The 1940 drama film of the same starred Barbara O&#x27;Neil as Fanny, Charles Boyer as De Choiseul-Praslin, and Bette Davis as Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, the governess. Sébastiani is portrayed by Montagu Love.

Sébastiani is also one of the protagonists in Prince Michael of Greece&#x27;s novel &quot;Sultana - La Nuit du Sérail&quot;, which depicts fictionalized events of Selim III&#x27;s rule. In 1989, the story was later turned into an American-Swiss film co-production: titled &quot;The Favorite&quot; (or &quot;La Nuit du Sérail&quot;), it starred Laurent Le Doyen as Sébastiani.

<text>The hundred of Trigg (also known as Triggshire) was one of ten ancient administrative shires of Cornwall—see &quot;Hundreds of Cornwall&quot;.

Trigg is mentioned by name during the 7th century, as &quot;Pagus Tricurius&quot;, &quot;land of three war hosts&quot;. It was to the north of Cornwall, and included Bodmin Moor, Bodmin and the district to the west and north of the Moor. The high incidence of imported pottery from the period found at Tintagel Castle suggests that this was an area of high significance, where war bands from the region may have congregated.

The name may be cognate with that of Trégor (Bro-Dreger) in Brittany, now northwest France. The same name is used for the ecclesiastical deaneries of Trigg Major and Trigg Minor which between them cover a wider area (but not identical to the historical boundaries). Since 1874 they have been within the Archdeaconry of Bodmin, and since 1876 within the Diocese of Truro.

The parishes of Triggshire consisted of Bodmin, Blisland, St Breward, Egloshayle, St Endellion, Helland, St Kew, St Mabyn, St Minver, St Teath, Temple, St Tudy.

==Modern usage==
The name Triggshire has been adopted by different clubs and organizations in the area. Triggshire Wind Orchestra, an amateur orchestra for wind players primarily from Sir James Smith&#x27;s School, Wadebridge School, Budehaven School, however some students from Bodmin College and Launceston College also attend. The orchestra was set up in 1984 by conductor Janet Elston, who still conducts them today. After the success of the wind orchestra, Triggshire String Orchestra was set up, to cater for the string players from these schools.

Trigg Morris are a long established Morris Dancing club.

==Literature==

The historian Sir John Maclean (1811-1895) came from Trehudreth in Blisland and his &quot;Parochial History of the Deanery of Trigg Minor&quot; (1872-1879) in 3 volumes is the most detailed work of parochial history which deals with Cornwall (the deanery consisted of 20 parishes at the time he wrote). It was published in parts intended for binding as three volumes: there was also a separate edition of the part on Blisland. (His name was originally John Lean but he adopted that of Maclean, in the belief that he had Maclean ancestors, because a contemporary Lean was incriminated in the Bodmin Moor Murder. Two versions of the origins of at least some of the Lean families of Devon and Cornwall have been passed through the oral tradition. One of these went with a Lean family to Australia in about 1820, and was passed down to Mike Lean, patent officer at the University of Queensland. Both versions include the disinheritance and banishment of two Maclean brothers (thus sans Mac) from the west of Scotland to a farm near Bodmin, where they married two sisters and lived near Blisland.)

<text>John Hughlings Jackson, FRS (4 April 1835 – 7 October 1911) was an English neurologist. He is best known for his research on epilepsy.

== Biography ==

He was born at Providence Green, Green Hammerton, near Harrogate, Yorkshire, the youngest son of Samuel Jackson, a brewer and yeoman who owned and farmed his land, and Sarah Jackson (née Hughlings), the daughter of a Welsh revenue collector. His mother died just over a year after giving birth to him. He had three brothers and a sister; his brothers emigrated to New Zealand and his sister married a physician. He was educated at Tadcaster, Yorkshire and Nailsworth, Gloucestershire before attending the York Medical and Surgical School. After qualifying at St Barts in 1856 he became house physician to the York Dispensary.

In 1859 he returned to London to work at the Metropolitan Free Hospital and the London Hospital. In 1862 he was appointed Assistant Physician, later (1869) full Physician at the National Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy located in Queen Square, London (now the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery) as well as Physician (1874) at the London Hospital. During this period he established his reputation as a neurologist. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1878.

Jackson died in London on 7 October 1911 and was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery. He was an atheist.
The Hull York Medical School building at the University of York is named in his honour.
== Science and research ==

Jackson was an innovative thinker and a prolific and lucid, if sometimes repetitive, writer. Though his range of interests was wide, he is best remembered for his seminal contributions to the diagnosis and understanding of epilepsy in all its forms and complexities. His name is attached eponymously to the characteristic &quot;march&quot; (The Jacksonian March) of symptoms in focal motor seizures and to the so-called &quot;dreamy state&quot; of psychomotor seizures of temporal lobe origin. His papers on the latter variety of epilepsy have seldom been bettered in their descriptive clinical detail or in their analysis of the relationship of psychomotor epilepsy to various patterns of pathological automatism and other mental and behavioural disorders.

Jackson also did research on aphasia, noting that some aphasic children were able to sing, even though they had lost the power of voluntary speech. He also studied what types of language loss was found in patients with left-brain injury, including set phrases, such as &quot;Good bye&quot; and &quot;Oh, dear.&quot;

In his youth Jackson had been interested in conceptual issues and it is believed that in 1859 he contemplated the idea of abandoning medicine for philosophy. Thus, an important part of his work concerned the evolutionary organization of the nervous system for which he proposed three levels: a lower, a middle, and a higher. At the lowest level, movements were to be represented in their least complex form; such centres lie in the medulla and spinal cord. The middle level consists of the so-called motor area of the cortex, and the highest motor levels are found in the prefrontal area.

The higher centres inhibited the lower ones and hence lesions thereat caused &#x27;negative&#x27; symptoms (due to an absence of function). &#x27;Positive&#x27; symptoms were caused by the functional release of the lower centres. This process Jackson called &#x27;dissolution&#x27;, a term he borrowed from Herbert Spencer. The &#x27;positive-negative&#x27; distinction he took from Sir John Reynolds.

Continental psychiatrists and psychologists (e.g. Théodule Ribot, Pierre Janet, Sigmund Freud, Henri Ey) have been more influenced by Jackson&#x27;s theoretical ideas than their British counterparts. During the 1980s, the &#x27;positive-negative&#x27; distinction was introduced in relation to the symptoms of schizophrenia.

He was one of only a few physicians to have delivered the Goulstonian (1869), Croonian (1884) and Lumleian (1890) lectures to the Royal College of Physicians. He also delivered the 1872 Hunterian Oration to the Hunterian Society.

=== Methodology ===

Jackson could not use modern sophisticated neuro-investigative technology (it had not been invented), but had to rely upon his own powers of clinical observation, deductive logic and autopsy data. Some of his eminent successors in the field of British neurology have been critical of many of his theories and concepts; but as Sir Francis Walshe remarked of his work in 1943, &quot; ... when all that is obsolete or irrelevant is discarded there remains a rich treasure of physiological insight we cannot afford to ignore.&quot;

In Otfrid Foerster&#x27;s research on the motor cortex, he cites exclusively Hughlings Jackson for the initial discovery (although without evidence) of the brain as the spring of neurological motor signalling.

== Contributions ==

Together with his friends Sir David Ferrier and Sir James Crichton-Browne, two eminent neuropsychiatrists of his time, Jackson was one of the founders of the important journal &quot;Brain&quot;, which was dedicated to the interaction between experimental and clinical neurology (still being published today). Its inaugural issue was published in 1878.

In 1892, Jackson was one of the founding members of the &quot;National Society for the Employment of Epileptics&quot; (now the National Society for Epilepsy), along with Sir William Gowers and Sir David Ferrier.

Oliver Sacks repeatedly cited Jackson as an inspiration in his neurologic work.

<text>Soyuz T-14 (, &quot;Union T-14&quot;) was the ninth expedition to Salyut 7. The mission relieved Soyuz T-13, whose crew had performed unprecedented repairs aboard the previously-dead station.

==Mission parameters==
* Mass:

* Inclination: 51.6°
* Period: 88.7 minutes

==Mission highlights==
Soyuz T-14 demonstrated the wisdom of maintaining a Soyuz at Salyut 7 as an emergency medical evacuation vehicle: the mission commander Vasyutin fell ill which forced an early termination of the planned 6-month mission.

The main goals of the mission was to receive Cosmos 1686, a modified TKS, and conduct spacewalks with application to future space stations. The first goal was achieved on October 2. Cosmos 1686 contained of freight, including large items like a girder to be assembled outside Salyut 7, and the Kristallizator materials processing apparatus. However, the crew of Soyuz T-14 were unable to achieve their second goal. By late October Vasyutin was no longer helping with experiments because he was ill.

On November 13 the cosmonauts began scrambling their communications with the TsUP. Return to Earth occurred soon after. Sources at NASA have reported that psychologists with the Russian Aviation and Space Agency cited Soyuz T-14 as ending prematurely due to &quot;mood and performance issues&quot; with the crew. Vasyutin&#x27;s illness is said to have been caused by a prostate infection or urinary tract infection, which had manifested itself as inflammation and a fever.

<text>George Kenneth Butterfield Jr. (born April 27, 1947) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the U.S. representative for North Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 2004 to 2022. A member of the Democratic Party, he was first elected in a special election after the resignation of Frank Ballance.

His district was in the state&#x27;s northeastern corner, which included all or parts of 19 counties. A longtime advocate of civil rights, Butterfield was appointed an associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court by Governor Mike Easley in 2001, retaining the position until 2003. He was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and served as its chair from 2015 to 2017.

In November 2021, Butterfield announced that he would not run for re-election in 2022.

On December 30, 2022, Butterfield resigned from his position to take up a lobbying position.

==Early life and education==
G. K. Butterfield was born and raised in the then segregated city of Wilson, North Carolina. Butterfield came from a prominent black family with a long history in North Carolina. Both of Butterfield&#x27;s parents were mixed-race Americans. His maternal grandfather, Rev Fred Davis, was a child of a former slave (Judah Davis) and a white man (Joe Davis). His mother, Addie, taught elementary school for 48 years in some of North Carolina&#x27;s poorest communities. She was keenly focused on ensuring that her students learned to read. Butterfield&#x27;s father, G. K. Butterfield Sr., was an immigrant from Bermuda. As a graduate of Meharry Medical College, he practiced dentistry for 50 years in the poor, segregated community of East Wilson. In the late 1940s, he helped found the Wilson Branch of the NAACP in order to register black voters in the county. In 1953, he became the first African American elected to the city council in Wilson and the first black elected official in eastern North Carolina since Reconstruction.

Butterfield graduated from Charles H. Darden High School in Wilson. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in political science and sociology from North Carolina Central University (NCCU), a historically black university. During his time at NCCU, Butterfield was active in voter registration activism, including coordinating voter registration drives in Durham and organizing a student march from the State Capitol in Raleigh to the Wilson County Courthouse to draw attention to the importance of voter registration. After completing his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Butterfield attended the NCCU School of Law, receiving a Juris Doctor degree in 1974.

During his junior year at NCCU, Butterfield was drafted into the United States Army and stationed at Fort Bragg Army installation in Fayetteville. He served from 1968 to 1970 and was honorably discharged, and he returned to NCCU to complete his undergraduate degree.

In describing his racial identity as a black man, he has pointed to his African heritage, as a direct descendant of enslaved people. He grew up in racially segregated North Carolina, living in &quot;East Wilson&quot;, where he attended black schools. He spent his childhood as a firsthand witness to the disenfranchisement of his black community originating as part of a targeted campaign to remove his father from the Board of Aldermen. He is the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.

==Judicial career==
After completing law school, Butterfield began a 14-year legal career as a civil rights attorney, practicing across eastern North Carolina. During this time, he developed his reputation, winning several voting-rights cases.

In 1988, Butterfield was elected Resident Superior Court judge in judicial district 7BC. Beginning on January 1, 1989, and for the next 12 years, he presided over civil and criminal court in 46 North Carolina counties. In February 2001, Governor Mike Easley appointed him to the North Carolina Supreme Court. In 2002, Butterfield lost his seat on the Supreme Court, but he returned to the Superior Court bench by special appointment of Governor Easley. He served in that position until his retirement in May 2004 to run for the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Political career==
Butterfield was first elected to the House of Representatives in a special election on July 20, 2004, to fill the seat of Frank Ballance, who had resigned after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and money laundering. He assumed office on July 21, 2004.

Butterfield served on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and formerly served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee. He was the Region VIII representative on the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.

Beginning in 2007, in the 110th Congress, Butterfield was chosen to serve as one of eight Chief Deputy Whips for the House Democratic Caucus. Chief Deputy Whips assist in the formulation of Democratic policy and ensure the passage of legislation by maintaining good communication with members. He was appointed to this position by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.

==Political positions==
As a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Butterfield advocated for the American Clean Energy and Security Act. He supports &quot;a market-based approach to capping carbon emissions&quot; and wants to broaden the United States&#x27; sources of energy. On his website, Butterfield stresses the need to find more clean and domestic sources of energy.

A strong supporter of civil rights, Butterfield advocated renewal of the Voting Rights Act and &quot;introduced a bill calling for the Capitol Visitor&#x27;s Center to acknowledge the slave labor used to build the Capitol.&quot;

Originally endorsing John Edwards for the 2008 Democratic Party presidential nomination, Butterfield endorsed Barack Obama in January 2008.

In 2009, Butterfield introduced the Don&#x27;t Let the Bed Bugs Bite Act &quot;to assist states in carrying out inspections of lodging facilities, train inspection personnel, contract with a commercial exterminator; educate owners and staff at lodging facilities.&quot; He also passed H.R. 4252 &quot;[t]o amend the Small Business Act to change the net worth amount under the small business program for socially and economically disadvantaged individuals from $750,000 to $978,722, and for other purposes.&quot;
Butterfield supported the Affordable Care Act, and worked with the Energy and Commerce Committee to help write the legislation. During the discussion of the bill in Congress, he complained about the lack of cooperation from Republicans.

Butterfield supports increasing taxes for higher-income families while decreasing taxes for middle- and low-income families. Although he is an advocate for using government stimulus in order to improve the economy, he wants to reduce government regulations on the private sector.

In 2008, Planned Parenthood gave Butterfield an 80% rating. In 2009, Butterfield supported the interests of NARAL Pro-Choice America 100% of the time. He identifies as pro-choice on abortion, and especially supports legalized abortion when the life of the woman is in danger or if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. He called the day that the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; a &quot;sad day&quot;.

Butterfield has repeatedly voted against defining marriage as being between one man and one woman, voting against the Marriage Protection Act of 2004 and constitutional marriage amendments in 2004 and 2006. He has voted to ban job discrimination based on sexual orientation, and in 2010 voted for the repeal of Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell.
Butterfield voted in 2008 against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) $700 billion bailout of the financial industry and the $14 billion rescue package for the auto industry.

In 2011, he voted to extend expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act and in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2012.

In 2012, Butterfield introduced legislation that would require more input from the public before tolls are introduced on roads. The legislation was in response to the &quot;No toll on I-95&quot; group, a Roanoke Rapids-based group that opposes instating a toll on I-95. Opponents of the toll argue that it leads to double taxation, and say it is the first time that &quot;the federal government has put tolls on an existing interstate.&quot;

In April 2012, Butterfield accompanied Obama to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to speak about extending the interest rates on federal loan programs for many undergraduate students. Butterfield expressed concern with the pending expiration, saying: &quot;Allowing the current interest rates to expire would burden students with additional debt, prolong their ability to kick start their careers, and send the message that it is more important to cut taxes for the wealthy than educational expenses for our young people.&quot;

On July 23, 2014, Butterfield introduced House Joint Resolution 120, approving the location of a memorial to commemorate the more than 5,000 slaves and free black persons who fought for independence in the American Revolution.

As of 2022, Butterfield has voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight.

==Personal life==

Butterfield is married to Dr. Sylvia Chester Butterfield. He and his former wife, Jean Farmer-Butterfield (1971–1991), are the parents of Valeisha Butterfield Jones and Jenetta Lenai Butterfield. He is also the father of Tunya Butterfield Smith. His four grandsons are Dahntay Jones Jr., Dillon Jones, Chase Smith, and Gavin Smith. Butterfield is a lifelong member of Jackson Chapel First Missionary Baptist Church in Wilson, North Carolina, where he has served as Trustee and Chairman of the Finance Ministry. He also serves on the Board of Visitors for the North Carolina Central University School of Law and as a Trustee of Gallaudet University. He is a member of Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, Gamma Sigma chapter and a member of Groove Phi Groove. In 2017, the City of Greenville named its new transit center, the G.K. Butterfield Transportation Center, in his honor. In 2024, a segment of Interstate 95 and the Wilson train station were also named in his honor.

<doc id="850144" wikidata="Q579837" url="?curid=850144" title="The 158-Pound Marriage">
<text>The 158-Pound Marriage is the third novel by American author John Irving. The book explores the sexual revolution-era trend of &quot;swinging&quot; (partner-swapping) via a glimpse into the lives of two couples in a small New England college town who enter casually into such an affair, with disastrous consequences.

==Plot summary==

The narrator (who never identifies himself by name) is a college professor and a relatively unsuccessful author of historical novels. While doing research in Vienna, Austria, he met Utch, an orphaned survivor of the German occupation and the Russian siege at the end of World War II. At the opening of the novel, the narrator and Utch are married with two children and live a relatively placid existence until, at a faculty party, they become acquainted with Severin Winter, a Viennese-born professor of German and coach of the school&#x27;s wrestling team, and his wife Edith, a WASP from a privileged background (she met her husband in Vienna while on a buying trip for MOMA) who is an aspiring fiction writer. The narrator begins a mentor-protégé relationship with Edith, and soon the couples are sharing dinners and arranging play dates for their children. As the narrator becomes more attracted to Edith, and Utch begins to fall for Severin, the couples begin trading spouses for sexual encounters at the end of their dinner dates. At first the affairs proceed smoothly, with emotional conflict submerged beneath sexual curiosity, but soon enough, obsessive love rears its ugly head, and the narrator begins to discover that the Winters have not been entirely honest with him and his wife about their motives for entering the affair.

It is ultimately revealed that sometime prior to the events of the novel Severin had an affair with a teacher at the school, and when Edith discovered this she became furious and depressed. In an attempt to provide her with some emotional leverage against him, Severin arranged for Edith to become sexually involved with the narrator, while he himself would sleep with Utch. This foursome soon thereafter fragments; Severin and Edith are able to repair their relationship and forgive each other for the pains they have inflicted on one another. The narrator and Utch, however, are a different story. The narrator had developed genuine feelings for Edith, and while she did seem to reciprocate them, at least to a small degree, he is left despondent after she ends their liaison to salvage her marriage to Severin. For her own part Utch had fallen completely in love with Severin, and she is left devastated upon learning he did not feel the same for her. Utch leaves and takes their children with her, returning to her native Austria to sort out her feelings; she also takes her husband&#x27;s passport so he cannot follow her. Edith and Severin likewise move to Austria, though it is revealed through letters that Utch writes her husband that she and the Winters do not interact with each other. The novel ends with a small bit of hope for the narrator and Utch when she mails him his passport, indicating she is now ready to mend their relationship.

The sport of wrestling featured prominently—the novel&#x27;s title refers to the 158-pound weight class, which Severin considers the most elite competitive weight—and a subplot eventually emerges involving Winter&#x27;s protégé, a peculiar wrestling prodigy from Iowa who transfers to Winter&#x27;s college because of its superior biology department and becomes a pawn in the fallout of the two couples&#x27; swinging relationship.

<text>Soyuz T-15 (, &quot;Union T-15&quot;) was a crewed mission to the Mir and Salyut 7 space stations and was part of the Soyuz programme. It marked the final flight of the Soyuz-T spacecraft, the third generation Soyuz spacecraft, which had been in service for seven years from 1979 to 1986. This mission marked the first time that a spacecraft visited, and docked with, two space stations in the same mission.

* Period: 91.5 minutes

== Mission highlights ==
Soyuz T-15 was both the first expedition to Mir and the last to Salyut 7.

===Flight to Mir===
Due to the pressure of launching Mir in time for the 27th Communist Party Congress, mission planners were left without the newer Soyuz-TM spacecraft or any of the planned modules to launch to the station at first. It was decided to launch an older Soyuz-T as Soyuz T-15 on a dual mission to both Mir and Salyut 7.

Leonid Kizim and Vladimir Solovyov first docked with the Mir space station on 15 March 1986 after their launch on 13 March. Plans for Mir intended that only the newer Soyuz-TM would dock with Mir&#x27;s forward port, leaving the aft port free for arriving Progress spacecraft. However, the older Soyuz-T was not equipped with the Kurs approach system used on Mir&#x27;s front port, but only with the older Igla approach system used for Mir&#x27;s aft port. Therefore, Soyuz T-15 had to approach Mir&#x27;s aft port, and then manually maneuver around the station to dock manually at the forward port. At 20 km Soyuz T-15&#x27;s Igla system acquired its counterpart on Mir&#x27;s aft port. At 200 meters, the Igla system was shut off, and the crew manually maneuvered around the station to dock at the front port. For this manual approach, the same laser range finder was used as for the Soyuz T-13 docking with the uncooperative Salyut 7 station in 1985.

During their nearly 55-day stay on Mir, the crew unloaded two Progress spacecraft, launched after their arrival. The mission was mostly designed to test out the new space station&#x27;s systems since it had been launched with little scientific equipment, most of which would have to wait for the launch of add-on modules. Despite Mir&#x27;s name literally meaning &quot;Peace&quot;, US officials during this time accused the Soviet Union of performing military experiments on their supposedly civilian space stations. After the cosmonauts&#x27; return to Earth, Leonid Kizim in an official press conference stated that Mir was not being used for any military purposes and that &quot;The US is accusing us of this sort of action in order to justify their own plans to extend the arms race into space.&quot; The Reagan Administration did not however reiterate these claims so as not to negatively impact the planned 1987 summit meeting between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

===The crew transfers to Salyut 7===
In preparation for the trip to Salyut 7, the crew loaded Soyuz T-15 with their personal belongings, plants grown on Mir, and other items. At that time Salyut 7 was still 4000 km ahead of Mir in a lower orbit in the same inclination. Therefore, on 4 May, Mir was lowered by 13 km in order to expedite the approach to Salyut 7 and conserve Soyuz T-15&#x27;s limited fuel supply for the transfer. On 5 May 1986 12:12:09 UTC they undocked from Mir for their journey to Salyut 7 – at this time, the distance between the two space stations had been reduced to 2500 km due to Mir&#x27;s maneuver. After a crossing of 29 hours, Soyuz T-15 docked with Salyut 7 on 6 May 16:57:52 UTC.

===Experiments on Salyut 7===
The previous crew on Salyut 7, Salyut 7 EO-4, had been assigned to conduct experiments with TKS-4 (Kosmos 1686). However, commander Vladimir Vasyutin had fallen ill and the crew had to return prematurely to Earth. Therefore, they were unable to perform EVAs, which would have had implications for the Mir program. 
After arriving at Salyut 7, the crew of Soyuz T-15 conducted two EVAs and collected experiment results, experimental apparatuses, and samples of materials to finish the work of the previous crew. 
The first EVA was on 28 May, when the crewmembers climbed outside to retrieve space exposure experiments and test the Ferma-Postroital (&quot;girder-constructor&quot;) device. A deployment canister converted a folded girder cartridge into a 15-meter girder in only a few minutes. The girder was retracted by reversing the process at the end of the EVA. This first EVA lasted 3 hours and 50 minutes. The second EVA consisted of girder and welding experiments. On 31 May, Kizim and Solovyov attached measurement devices to the top of the retracted girder, then re-extended it with an aim toward studying its rigidity. They then used an electron gun to weld several of the girder&#x27;s joints. This second EVA lasted five hours.

===Ferry flight back to Mir===
The crew removed 20 instruments with a total mass of 350 to 400 kg from Salyut 7 before returning to Mir. Mir maneuvered twice again between 24–25 June, raising its orbit slightly and moving closer to Salyut 7. On 25 June, Soyuz T-15 undocked from Salyut 7 to begin their 29-hour journey back to Mir, to which they returned on 25–26 June.

On 3 July, Kizim surpassed Valeri Ryumin&#x27;s record for time spent in space. On 6 July, he became the first human to have spent a full year in space. The crew spent their last 20 days on Mir conducting Earth observations.

Meanwhile, between 19 and 22 August, engines on Kosmos 1686 boosted Salyut 7 to a record-high mean orbital altitude of 475 km to forestall reentry. Atmospheric drag took its toll, however, and the station reentered over South America 55 months later. Pieces of Salyut 7 and Kosmos 1686 were found in Argentina.

Soyuz T-15 was the last mission to use the Soyuz-T spacecraft, due to its replacement by the Soyuz-TM.

<text>The Member of Parliament for [[Leeds Central]], Rt. Hon. Derek Fatchett, (Labour) died suddenly on 9 May 1999. The Labour government rushed to organise for the by-election and moved the writ so that the election could be held on 10 June, the same day as elections to the European Parliament.

The shortlist for the Labour candidacy included the Chair of Leeds Central Constituency Labour Party, Maggie Giles-Hill, and Shahid Malik, but the selection went to Hilary Benn who had been Special Adviser to David Blunkett, then Secretary of State for Education and Employment. The Conservatives chose their general election candidate Edward Wild. The Liberal Democrats provided the strongest challenge and increased their vote by nearly 20%, but this was not enough to take the seat.

The campaign was subsumed with the European Parliament elections, and the result was an all-time low turnout for a by-election: at 19.9% it held the record for the lowest turnout in a UK parliamentary election since World War II, until surpassed in 2012 by the Manchester Central by-election.

<doc id="850160" wikidata="Q512537" url="?curid=850160" title="Walter B. Jones Jr.">
<text>Walter Beaman Jones Jr. (February 10, 1943 – February 10, 2019) was an American politician who served twelve terms in the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party for from 1995 until his death in 2019. The district encompassed the coastal regions of North Carolina, from the Outer Banks and areas near the Pamlico Sound in the north, southwards to the northern suburbs of Wilmington. Jones&#x27;s father was Walter B. Jones Sr., a Democratic Party congressman from the neighboring 1st district. Prior to his election to the U.S. House of Representatives, he served ten years in the North Carolina House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic Party and worked as a business executive.

He had been a Democrat like his father before changing parties in 1994, just before his first election to the U.S. House. Even after becoming a Republican, he frequently broke with the party over key issues. He supported the U.S. involvement in the Iraq War initially, but became one of its staunchest critics, arguing that the George W. Bush administration misinformed Congress with selective intelligence to win authorization for the war. He also was a critic of the Bush administration in their firing of federal prosecutors, and joined Democrats in supporting raises to the federal minimum wage. During the Obama administration, he voted against the Republican Path to Prosperity budget proposal of 2011, after which he was removed from key committee roles for defying party leadership. During the first Trump presidency, he was a frequent voice on the floor of Congress calling for scrutiny of the Trump presidency, including demanding the release of his tax returns and calling for investigations into alleged Trump presidential campaign involvement in the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

Having libertarian-leaning tendencies, he was a member of the Liberty Caucus.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Jones was the son of U.S. representative Walter B. Jones Sr. (1913–1992) and Doris (Long) Jones (1914–1984).

Jones was a lifelong resident of Farmville, a small town near Greenville, North Carolina. He attended Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia and graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts from Atlantic Christian College (now Barton College) in Wilson, North Carolina, before serving four years (1967–1971) in the North Carolina National Guard. He worked as an executive with his family&#x27;s business supply company.

==North Carolina legislature==
Jones was first elected as a Democrat to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1982 and served for five terms, until 1992. He represented Pitt County. He was known in the North Carolina House for his advocacy of campaign finance reform and lobbying reform.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1992
After his father announced his retirement from Congress in 1992, Jones ran for his father&#x27;s seat in North Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district. He ranked first in the Democratic primary with 38% of the vote, but failed to reach the 40% threshold to win the nomination. In the run-off election, he was defeated by Eva Clayton, Chairwoman of the Warren County Board of Commissioners, by a margin of 55–45%. Clayton received support from three of the defeated primary candidates and from the African American community. Jones Sr. died before his term expired, and Clayton was elected to serve out the last two months of his term.

;1994
In 1994, he switched parties and ran in North Carolina&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, which had absorbed a large chunk of his father&#x27;s former territory. His race against incumbent Democrat Martin Lancaster was initially very close until Jones released a picture of Lancaster jogging with President Bill Clinton, whose socially liberal stances (especially on gays in the military) angered many voters in the district. Although Democrats had a large advantage in registered voters, the 3rd district had a very strong social conservative tint. Jesse Helms in particular had a large base of support there. As part of the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, Jones defeated Lancaster 53–47%. With his victory, Jones became the first Republican to represent a significant portion of Eastern North Carolina in the House since Reconstruction.

;1996–2004
From 1994 on Jones won re-election with at least 61% in every general election. His most serious general election challenge came in 2000, when his opponent spent well in excess of $1.4 million in attempting to unseat him. Jones garnered 61% of the vote in that contest, largely helped by George W. Bush, winning the 3rd with his highest victory margin in the state.

;2006

He was easily re-elected to a 7th term in 2006, receiving 69% of the vote despite a very bad national result for Republicans overall.

;2008

Jones&#x27; change of heart on the Iraq War (see below) resulted in him facing serious primary opposition for the first time since his initial run for Congress. He was challenged by Onslow County Commissioner Joe McLaughlin. Jones defeated the poorly funded McLaughlin 59–41%. In the general election, Jones defeated Craig Weber 66–34%.

;2010

In the general election, he defeated Johnny Rouse with 73% of the vote.

;2012

He faced Frank Palombo, a former New Bern police chief in the Republican primary on May 8 and won. He won against Marine Corps Veteran Erik Anderson in the general election.

;2014

He faced Taylor Griffin, a former aide to President George W. Bush, who was heavily supported by outside money, and won the Republican Party primary on May 6.

;2016

He defeated Democrat Ernest Reeves by 67–32%.

;2018

Jones was re-elected to his final term in November 2018 unopposed.

===Tenure===

Jones had a lifetime rating of 84.69 from the American Conservative Union. However, his voting record had become somewhat more moderate in the years prior to his death, according to the group&#x27;s ranking. In recent years, he had received some of the lowest ACU ratings of any Republican from the South. In 2006, he received a 79, in 2007 he received a 71, in 2008 he received a 58, in 2009 he received an 83, in 2010 he received a 65, and in 2011 he received a 60. The former five ratings were the lowest recorded in those years for a Republican from North Carolina.

Jones was ranked as the 37th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from North Carolina) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

Jones said that his father was able to vote his conscience until he became a member of the House Democratic leadership, at which time he had to vote with the party line. For instance, his father voted for the 1975 federal bailout of a bankrupt New York City even though he personally opposed it. Jones said of that vote, &quot;He had to vote it that way. I would rather do what I think is right than to sell my political soul.&quot; Jones drifted towards the libertarian spectrum when he changed his positions on foreign policy including the Iraq War.

Jones opposed pork barrel spending projects and was a staunch advocate of federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and voted for H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

Jones sided with the Democrats on economic issues such as raising the minimum wage. He was an animal lover and said he would like a memorial created on the National Mall for war dogs. Jones endorsed Ron Paul in the 2008 race for president of the United States. In an annual survey conducted by &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine, congressional staffers voted Jones the kindest member of the House.

In 2007, Jones cosponsored legislation with fellow North Carolina congressman Heath Shuler to require airlines to have sections of the aircraft where large movie screens were not visible. This was to avoid the situation where children could potentially watch films found objectionable by their parents. He also was the only Republican co-sponsor of legislation to challenge Tom DeLay&#x27;s proposed changes to House ethics rules.

On February 14, 2008, Jones was one of only three Republicans (along with Ron Paul and Wayne Gilchrest) to vote to hold George W. Bush confidantes Joshua Bolten and Harriet Miers in contempt of Congress for failing to testify and provide documents relevant to the firing of federal prosecutors. On September 15, 2009, Jones was one of only seven Republicans to vote for a resolution of disapproval of fellow Representative Joe Wilson for his actions during President Obama&#x27;s address to a Joint Session of Congress on September 9, 2009.

Jones presented the Walter B. Jones Campus Defender of Freedom Award to a North Carolina activist selected by a committee at Duke University, including the Duke College Republicans; in 2009, Jones presented the award to B.J. Lawson. At the 2009 ceremony, Jones said that &quot;The Republican Party needs to have a face that can be seen and identified with by people of all races. The future of the Republican Party lies in being able to relate to the average working family.&quot; He also spoke in favor of making Duke&#x27;s endowment more transparent, saying that he is in favor of more openness on the part of institutions: &quot;To me, sunshine is the answer.&quot;

In 2010, congressional aides on Capitol Hill ranked Jones as the second nicest in the U.S. House of Representatives and the second least partisan member of the House.

On April 15, 2011, Jones was one of four Republican members of Congress to vote against &quot;The Path to Prosperity&quot;. In December 2012, Jones was one of four House Republicans removed from their committees by Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor for defying party leadership. Jones was removed from the Financial Services Committee, a plum seat for fundraising, ostensibly as reprisal for not raising money for the Republican Party. However, it was speculated that Jones, who was popular in the caucus, was only removed to give &quot;cover&quot; for the removals of Justin Amash of Michigan, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas and David Schweikert of Arizona who lost their own plum committee assignments, characterized as a result of them being &quot;assholes&quot;. Representative Lynn Westmoreland concluded, &quot;some people ... just don&#x27;t want to work within the system.&quot; Jones maintained his seat on the Armed Services Committee.

He is the author of Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act (H.R. 126;113th Congress).

In February 2017, Jones signed a letter to urge Congress to request President Donald Trump&#x27;s tax returns so that they can be reviewed in a closed session of Congress and determined whether the returns can be released to the public. During the 115th United States Congress, Jones voted in line with Trump&#x27;s stated positions 49.3 percent of the time, the lowest rate of any Republican conference member.

On March 28, 2017, Jones became the first Republican Congressman to call for Representative Devin Nunes to recuse himself as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He cited the alleged impropriety of Congressman Nunes&#x27; meeting at the White House the previous week as the reason for breaking with his party on the issue.

====Foreign wars====

Jones was initially a strong supporter of the conflict in Iraq, but then became one of the leading Republicans opposed to continued involvement in Iraq. Jones became well known for leading the effort, along with GOP Rep. Bob Ney, to have French fries renamed &quot;freedom fries&quot; on House cafeteria menus as a protest against French opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Jones later modified his stance on the war to a considerable extent. In 2005, he stated that he had come to believe that there had been little reason to go to war, despite his earlier support, which had been based upon selective intelligence supplied to Congress. He said of his previous position on the fries, &quot;I wish it had never happened.&quot; In July 2006, the names were quietly changed back.

On March 17, 2005, he sponsored a bill endorsing the conduct of his Camp Lejeune constituent, controversial Marine Corps Lieutenant Ilario Pantano, who faced charges (subsequently dropped) for having shot two Iraqis (allegedly unarmed civilians) on April 15, 2004.

Jones called on President George W. Bush to apologize for misinforming Congress to win authorization for the war. Jones said, &quot;If I had known then what I know today, I wouldn&#x27;t have voted for that resolution.&quot;

Jones contended that the United States went to war &quot;with no justification.&quot; On the subject, he said, &quot;I just feel that the reason of going in for weapons of mass destruction, the ability of the Iraqis to make a nuclear weapon, that&#x27;s all been proven that it was never there.&quot; He added that his change of opinion came about from attending the funeral of a sergeant killed in Iraq, when his last letter to his family was being read out. On June 16, 2005, he joined with three other members of Congress (Neil Abercrombie, Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul) in introducing a resolution calling for the start of a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq to begin by October 2006. Jones covered the hallway outside his office with photographs of soldiers who had died in Iraq. He said, &quot;If we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration, to commit the authority to send boys, and in some instances girls, to go into Iraq, that is wrong. Congress must be told the truth.&quot;

In 2007, he and Rep. William Delahunt (D–MA) introduced the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, which sought to &quot;prohibit the president from ordering military action without congressional approval, except when the United States or U.S. troops were attacked or when U.S. citizens needed to be evacuated.&quot;

On January 12, 2007, he introduced H. J. Res. 14: Concerning the use of military force by the United States against Iran in the 110th congress. According to Jones on his web site, the resolution requires that – absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces – the President must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran. This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–CA) on March 13, 2007.

On March 23, 2007, Jones was one of two Republicans to vote for a bill that would have required President George W. Bush to bring combat troops home from Iraq by September 1, 2008. The other Republican was Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

Jones&#x27; views on the war in Iraq did not ingratiate him to Bush or to the Republican leadership, which prevented him from succeeding the late Jo Ann Davis as ranking Republican on the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Forces Committee. He was passed over for Randy Forbes when the 110th Congress convened because the full committee&#x27;s ranking member, Duncan Hunter of California, did not agree with Jones&#x27; change of heart on the war. He had been approached by some Democrats about bolting the GOP and either becoming an independent caucusing with the Democrats or switching back to the Democratic Party outright. Additionally, Jones&#x27; changed views on the war and other issues angered many Republicans in his district, which has the largest military presence of any in North Carolina.

On March 7, 2012, Jones introduced House Concurrent Resolution 107, proposing that Congress should consider waging wars without an Act of Congress as grounds for impeachment of the President for High Crimes and Misdemeanors according to the Constitution of the United States of America.

In April 2017, Jones criticized U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, highlighting that Al-Qaeda in Yemen &quot;has emerged as a de facto ally of the Saudi-led militaries with whom [Trump] administration aims to partner more closely.&quot;

In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Jones put out a press release calling it &quot;horrific and senseless.&quot; He expressed that he was mourning the loss of Shane Evan Tomlinson, a graduate from East Carolina University.

Jones co-sponsored the No More Presidential Wars Act with Democrat Tulsi Gabbard in 2017.

=== Committee assignments (115th Congress) ===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces
** Subcommittee on Military Personnel

===Caucus memberships===
Jones served on the Liberty Caucus (sometimes called the Liberty Committee), a group of libertarian-minded Republican congressional representatives. Congressman Ron Paul originally hosted a luncheon for the Liberty Caucus every Thursday. The caucus was subsequently hosted and chaired by Congressman Justin Amash. Other members included Jim Duncan of Tennessee, Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

Jones was a member of the Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus and the Veterinary Medicine Caucus.

==Political positions==

Jones co-sponsored four cannabis bills, including supporting veterans&#x27; access to medical cannabis and hemp farming. He voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 due to the anticipated $2 trillion that would be added to the national debt. &quot;I&#x27;m all for tax reform, but it must grow the economy, not the debt,&quot; he stated. He also voted against it due to concerns that his constituents would pay more taxes. &quot;That is the last thing struggling families need,&quot; he stated in wake of the vote. Jones agreed with Michael Mullen and James Mattis that the national debt is the &quot;biggest threat&quot; to national security.

==Personal life==
Jones was raised a Southern Baptist, but was a Roman Catholic convert at the age of 31. He married Joe Anne Whitehurst in 1966, and the two had one child, a daughter, Ashley.

===Illness and death===
In July 2018, Jones began to miss votes due to illness; in December of that year, the House granted him a leave of absence for the remainder of the session by unanimous consent. As he was temporarily unable to travel, he was sworn in as a member of the 116th Congress from his home in Farmville. In January 2019, he broke his hip. On January 26, 2019, his wife said that he had been admitted to hospice care.

Jones died on February 10, 2019, in Greenville, North Carolina, on his 76th birthday. After Jones&#x27;s funeral, it was revealed that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis two months prior to his death. Members of Congress paid tribute to him in a special session on March 5, 2019.

== History ==

===1835 - 1948===
The chemist and paint business Gehe &amp; Co. was founded on 1 May 1835 by Franz Ludwig Gehe in Dresden on Königstraße and opened to the capital market by converting it into a stock corporation on 1 January 1903. In January 1904, the shares were admitted to the official public listing in Dresden.

In 1909, the company moved to the new location on Leipziger Straße and the trading house in Königstraße was vacated. With capital increases in 1910 and 1912, the financial basis for the establishment and expansion of a German-wide distribution of &quot;drugs and paints, pharmaceutical and chemical products&quot; was created. In 1922, the company founded its first German branch in Stuttgart. 
After the Second World War, the parent company in Dresden and most of the branches were expropriated. Gehe &amp; Co. AG made a fresh start in West Germany with branches in Stuttgart, Kassel and Sulzbach-Rosenberg.

===1948 - 1981===
The Gehe parent company continued to operate in 1947 in Dresden under the name Heilchemie as a publicly owned enterprise and on 1 April 1951 with the nationalised parent company of the pharmaceutical company Dr. Madaus &amp; Co from Radebeul merged to form VEB Arzneimittelwerk Dresden. Haniel took over the majority of the Gehe &amp; Co. AG shares with effect from 1 January 1973. The condition of Haniel was that the GEHE’s management remained in the company, in order to further expand the solid foundation that was established after the war. The name Gehe, known in the pre-war period, was brought to the attention of pharmacists with the revitalised or newly created branches. These branches were formed during the transition to Haniel: Bremen, Hamburg, Kassel, Kelkheim, Landshut, Mühldorf, Munich, Nuremberg, Regensburg and Stuttgart. In 1973, the company achieved a turnover of DM 285 million. Other pharmaceutical wholesalers (Friedrich Schäfer GmbH, Weiterstadt and Kaiserslautern, Wilmaco GmbH, Hamm and Lieser Pharma-GmbH, Duisburg) were brought in to Gehe &amp; Co. AG via the majority shareholder Franz Haniel &amp; Cie.

===1981 - 2008===
In 1982, the Haniel Group acquired RUWA Rudloff &amp; Watermann GmbH &amp; Co. KG in Minden, a pharmaceutical wholesale company with a branch in Delmenhorst and integrated it into Gehe. In 1985, the Kaiser + Kraft Group, Stuttgart, a mail-order business for transport, storage, operational facilities and office equipment, was acquired. Until 1992, customers in Germany were supplied from the branches based in Hamburg, Berlin, Haan, Dresden, Stuttgart and Munich. In the following years, the group&#x27;s trading structure spread across 14 countries in Europe and the USA. With the public offering of TAKKT on 15 September 1999, the spin-off of the Mail Order Division was ended.

===From 2003===

In April 2003, the company celebrated its 100th year. On the birthday of the conversion into a joint-stock company, the Annual General Meeting decided to change the name from Gehe AG to Celesio AG, with a majority of 99.98%. Today, the German subsidiary GEHE Pharma Handel still operates under its original name. In April 2007, Celesio announced the acquisition of 90% of the shares in the mail-order pharmacy DocMorris, in order to build up a pharmacy chain across Germany. The acquisition took place in hopes that the third-party ownership ban of the Pharmacies Act would fail, but it was legitimised in May 2009 by the EuGH. For the pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe, which was also part of the Celesio Group, the acquisition resulted in a loss of customers as pharmacists saw a threat in the chain. DocMorris was now operated as a franchise-like concept, in which pharmacists were allowed to use the DocMorris brand with the payment of a monthly licence fee. As a result, Celesio sold DocMorris in October 2012 to the company Zur Rose AG.

In June 2009, it became known that Celesio had acquired the majority of the largest Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler, Panpharma. In April 2012, Panpharma was fully taken over. In February 2016, Celesio agreed to sell its Brazilian business, consisting of Panpharma and Oncoprod, to the holding of the Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler, SantaCruz. In September 2013, Celesio sold its subsidiary, Rudolf Spiegel GmbH, to the company WEPA Apothekenbedarf.

On 24 October 2013, the US-based McKesson Corporation announced an agreement to acquire Celesio for EUR 6.1 billion (approx. EUR 23 per share). However, on 13 January 2014, the company reported that McKesson&#x27;s acquisition of Celesio was unsuccessful, due to the 75% threshold not being reached. At the start of November 2013, the Elliot hedge fund acquired 12.68% of Celesio from Paul Singer, a well-known course of action by him to benefit from takeovers. Following McKesson&#x27;s failed takeover, Singer increased his direct and indirect stake to around 32%. On 23 January 2014, Haniel took over the share from the Elliott hedge fund and served the 75.99% one day later to McKesson, which meant that the takeover was still a success. 
Sainsbury’s and Celesio announced the formation of a strategic pharmacy partnership in July 2013, in the course of which McKesson Europe&#x27;s subsidiary LloydsPharmacy would acquire Sainsbury’s pharmacy business for GBP 125 million. 
Until 21 September 2015, the company&#x27;s shares were listed in MDAX. The quotation in the index was removed, due to the change in the stock exchange segment from Prime Standard to the Regulated Unofficial Market. On 12 September 2017, Celesio was renamed McKesson Europe.

On 12 December 2019, McKesson Corporation announced that it planned to bring its German wholesale business (GEHE Pharma Handel GmbH, a subsidiary of McKesson Europe) into a joint venture with Alliance Healthcare Deutschland AG (a subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance). McKesson should hold 30% of the planned joint venture, Walgreens Boots Alliance 70%.

<doc id="850170" wikidata="Q331278" url="?curid=850170" title="Richard Burr">
<text>Richard Mauze Burr (born November 30, 1955) is an American businessman and politician who served as a United States senator from North Carolina from 2005 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, Burr was previously a member of the United States House of Representatives.

Born in Charlottesville, Virginia, Burr is a graduate of Wake Forest University. Before seeking elected office, he was a sales manager for a lawn equipment company. In 1994, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for North Carolina&#x27;s 5th congressional district as part of the Republican Revolution.

Burr was first elected to the United States Senate in 2004. From 2015 to 2020, he chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. In 2016, he announced that he would not seek reelection in 2022. Burr temporarily stepped down as chair of the Intelligence Committee on May 15, 2020, amid an FBI investigation into allegations of insider trading during the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 19, 2021, the Department of Justice announced that the investigation had been closed, with no charges against Burr.

Burr was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Donald Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Burr was born on November 30, 1955, in Charlottesville, Virginia, the son of Martha (Gillum) and Rev. David Horace White Burr. He graduated from Richard J. Reynolds High School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1974 and earned a B.A. in communications from Wake Forest University in 1978. In college, Burr played defensive back for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team. He is a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

Before running for Congress, Burr worked for 17 years as a sales manager for Carswell Distributing Company, a distributor of lawn equipment.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1992, Burr ran against incumbent Representative Stephen L. Neal for the seat in the Winston-Salem-based 5th District and lost. He ran again in 1994 after Neal chose not to seek reelection, and was elected in a landslide year for Republicans.

In the House, Burr authored the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. He also helped create the National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, he successfully sponsored amendments to improve defenses against bioterrorism.

As a representative, Burr co-sponsored, with Senator Kit Bond, an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2003 relaxing restrictions on the export of specific types of enriched uranium that were first enacted in the Schumer Amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The original Schumer amendment placed increased controls on U.S. civilian exports of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) to encourage foreign users to switch to reactor-grade low-enriched uranium (LEU) for isotope production. HEU is attractive to terrorists because it can be used to create a simple nuclear weapon, while LEU cannot be used directly to make nuclear weapons. Burr&#x27;s amendment allowed exports of HEU to five countries for creating medical isotopes.

Burr was reelected four times with no substantial opposition. He never received less than 62% of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2002.

==United States Senate==
===Elections===

====2004====

In July 2004, Burr won the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by John Edwards, who chose to not seek reelection while running for vice president as Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry&#x27;s running mate in the 2004 presidential election.

Burr faced Democratic nominee Erskine Bowles and Libertarian Tom Bailey; he won the election with 52% of the vote. Burr was sworn in to the Senate on January 4, 2005.

====2010====

Burr defeated the Democratic nominee, North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall, 55% to 43%. He was the first Republican since Jesse Helms to be reelected to the U.S. Senate from North Carolina and the first incumbent senator from North Carolina receive a double-digit margin of victory since Sam Ervin&#x27;s 1968 reelection. Burr&#x27;s win also represented the first time that North Carolina reelected a senator to this seat since Ervin’s 1968 victory, leading Burr to declare &quot;the curse has been broken&quot; on election night; Democrats and Republicans swapped control of the seat five times between 1968 and 2010.

====2016====

Burr defeated Democratic nominee Deborah K. Ross, 51% to 45%. Burr was an advisor for Donald Trump&#x27;s successful 2016 presidential campaign.

====2022====

On July 20, 2016, while campaigning for a third Senate term, Burr announced that he would not seek a fourth term in 2022. He did not seek reelection in 2022.

Burr delivered a farewell address on the Senate floor on December 14, 2022, and his final term expired on January 3, 2023. He was succeeded by Ted Budd.

===Tenure and political positions===

In 2007, Burr ran for chair of the Senate Republican Conference, but lost to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee by a vote of 31 to 16. In 2009, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the Senate Republican Whip, appointed Burr Chief Deputy Whip in the 111th Congress. In 2007, Burr was named a deputy whip. In 2011, he announced his intention to seek the post of minority whip, the number two Republican position in the Senate, but he dropped out of the race in 2012.

As of January 2021, Burr&#x27;s votes aligned with President Trump&#x27;s positions about 89% of the time. He voted against the majority of his party in about 1.5% of votes. The American Conservative Union&#x27;s Center for Legislative Accountability gave Burr a lifetime rating of 84.22.

Burr served as a member of the board of Brenner Children&#x27;s Hospital and the West Point Board of Visitors.

==== Campaign finance ====
Burr opposed the DISCLOSE Act, which would have required political ads include information about who funded the ad. He supported the U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Citizens United&quot;, which allowed political action committees to spend an unlimited amount of money during elections so long as they were not in direct coordination with candidates.

====Economy====
During his time in office, Burr was critical of financial regulations; he strongly opposed, and voted against, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In 2018, he voted for legislation that partly repealed the Dodd–Frank reforms.

In fall 2008, during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Burr said he was going to an ATM every day and taking out cash because he thought the financial system would soon collapse. In 2009, in response to press about his experience, Burr said that he would do the same thing again next time.

Burr was a signatory of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, vowing to oppose to tax increases for any reason. He opposed raising taxes on businesses or high-income people to fund public services.

In 2013, Burr criticized Senator Ted Cruz and other Republican colleagues for filibustering the passage of the fiscal year 2014 federal budget (thereby precipitating a federal government shutdown) in an effort to defund the Affordable Care Act. Burr called the approach of Cruz and allies &quot;the height of hypocrisy&quot; and the &quot;dumbest idea I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot;

Burr opposed ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and supported the adoption of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement.

In March 2015, Burr voted for an amendment to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow employees to earn paid sick time. He opposed raising the federal minimum wage.

In 2016, Burr supported the privatization of Social Security.

====Environment and climate change====

Burr was one of 20 senators to vote against the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, a public land management and conservation bill. He supported renewal of the 1965 Land and Water Conservation Fund.

During his time in office, Burr did not accept the scientific consensus on climate change; he acknowledged that climate change is occurring, but expressed doubt that it is caused by human activity. He opposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and opposed federal grants or subsidies to encourage the productions of renewable energy. In 2015, he voted against a measure declaring that climate change is real and that human activity significantly contributes to it. In 2013, Burr voted for a measure expressing opposition to a federal tax or fee on carbon emissions. He voted in favor of the Keystone XL pipeline.

In 2017, Burr voted to repeal the Stream Protection Rule as well as rules requiring energy companies to reduce waste, reduce emissions, and disclose payments from foreign governments. In 2019, he voted to repeal an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule regarding emissions. He supported lowering federal taxes on alternative fuels and the initiation of a hydropower project on the Yadkin River in Wilkes County, North Carolina. In 2011, Burr voted to abolish the EPA and merge it with the U.S. Department of Energy.

In 2019, Burr and nine Republican colleagues founded the Roosevelt Conservation Caucus, which advocates &quot;market-based approaches&quot; to environmental problems; the caucus is supported by the American Conservation Coalition.

==== Education ====
In 2017, Burr voted to confirm Betsy DeVos as U.S. education secretary; she was confirmed by a 51–50 vote, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote after the Senate deadlocked. DeVos&#x27;s family donated $43,200 to Burr&#x27;s 2016 reelection campaign.

Burr typically voted against any increased funding for federal education projects, and in 2016 said he opposed increasing Pell Grants and other forms of student financial aid, including new subsidies aimed at helping students refinance their loans. He supported the goals of charter schools and supported legislation requiring public schools to allow school prayer. He voted for the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.

====Foreign policy====
Burr has been described as a foreign policy hawk. In 2002, he voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution, which authorized the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Burr supported President Bush&#x27;s troop surge in Iraq in January 2007, saying that the effort to counter the insurgency would increase &quot;security and stability&quot; in Iraq. In February 2019, he voted for a measure disapproving of the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan and Syria. In February 2020, Burr voted against a measure restricting Trump from initiating military action against Iran without congressional approval.

In 2017, Burr co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would have made it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank to protest actions of the Israeli government.

In 2018 and 2019, Burr opposed legislation to prohibit U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and to end U.S. military assistance to the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

====Gun policy====
In 2016, the NRA Political Victory Fund gave Burr an &quot;A+&quot; rating and endorsed him for reelection for backing pro-gun legislation. The NRA extensively supported Burr&#x27;s election campaigns. In the 2016 election, the NRA spent nearly $7 million to support Burr against his Democratic rival Deborah Ross; over his career, Burr received more monetary support from the NRA than almost any other member of Congress Burr used the same media consultant as the NRA for his political ads.

In 2013, Burr voted against gun control measures, including extended background checks to internet and gun show weapons purchases and an assault weapons ban. He sponsored legislation to stop the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from adding the names of veterans to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) if the department had assigned a financial fiduciary to take care of the veteran&#x27;s finances due to mental incompetence, unless a judge or magistrate deemed them a danger. People added to the NICS system are normally barred from purchasing or owning a firearm. Burr voted against Senator Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s &quot;no fly no buy&quot; bill, but supported a Republican alternative measure written by Senator John Cornyn which proposed a 72-hour delay on gun sales to people whose names have been on a federal terror watch list within the past five years.&quot;

Speaking privately on the topic of guns to a group of Republican volunteers in Mooresville, North Carolina, Burr joked that a magazine cover of Hillary Clinton ought to have had a bullseye on it. He quickly apologized for the comment.

In 2022, Burr was one of ten Republican senators to support a bipartisan agreement on gun control, which involved a red flag provision, a support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under the age of 21, and penalties for straw purchases.

====Health policy====
Burr voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in December 2009, and against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. In 2014, Burr and Senator Orrin Hatch sponsored the Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility and Empowerment Act, which would have repealed and replaced the ACA. In 2017, Burr voted for the Republican legislation to replace major parts of the ACA; the legislation failed in the Senate on a 50–49 vote.

In 2012, Burr co-sponsored a plan to overhaul Medicare; his bill would have raised the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 over time and shifted more seniors to private insurance. The proposal would have begun &quot;a transition to a system dominated by private insurance plans.&quot;

Burr opposed legislation to allow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate the tobacco industry, which is economically important in North Carolina, and unsuccessfully tried to filibuster the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009. In 2010, he introduced the National Uniformity for Food Act, unsuccessful legislation that would have banned states from forcing manufacturers to include labels other than those required by the FDA on consumables and health and beauty products.

====Social issues====
In 2018, Burr voted in favor of legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. He supported parental notification laws and efforts to restrict federal funding of Planned Parenthood. He voted to define a pregnancy as carrying an &quot;unborn child&quot; from the moment of conception. He voted to prevent minors who have crossed state lines from getting an abortion, as well as to ensure parents are notified if their child does get an abortion. He voted to extend the federal prohibition on tax dollars being used for abortions by preventing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from giving grants to any organization that performs abortions at any of its locations.

Burr opposed the legalization of cannabis for both medical and recreational use. He stated that there should be greater enforcement of current anti-cannabis federal laws in all states, even when cannabis is legal as a matter of state law.

Burr voted for the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, the only Southern Republican senator to do so. The bill repealed the Defense Department&#x27;s don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy of employment discrimination against openly gay individuals. Burr and John Ensign were the only senators who voted against cloture but for passage; Burr said he opposed taking up the issue of DADT repeal amid wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but voted in favor of the bill anyway, becoming one of eight Republicans who backed the final repeal bill.

Burr supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, but in 2013 said that he believed the law on same-sex marriage should be left to the states. In 2013, he voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill to extend federal employment discrimination protections to LGBT persons. In 2015, Burr was one of 11 Senate Republicans to vote in favor of allowing same-sex spouses to have access to federal Social Security and veterans&#x27; benefits.

Burr supported policies to regulate bathroom access according to sex listed on birth certificates, but sought to distance himself from H.B. 2, North Carolina&#x27;s controversial &quot;bathroom legislation&quot;.

Burr voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in 2013.

Burr voted against earmarking money for programs aimed at reducing teen pregnancy He has stated he supports giving employers the right to restrict access to birth control coverage of employees if it is for moral reasons.

In December 2018, Burr was one of 12 Republican senators to vote against the cloture motion on the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform measure altering federal sentencing laws, but ultimately voted for the law.

In 2022, Burr was one of 12 Republican senators to vote in support of the Respect for Marriage Act.

====Judiciary====
In 2016, Burr and other Republican senators opposed holding a nomination hearing for Judge Merrick Garland, whom President Obama nominated to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States; he also refused to have a customary meeting with Garland. In 2016, Burr blocked consideration of Obama&#x27;s nomination of Patricia Timmons-Goodson to fill an 11-year vacancy on U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. He expressed pride that his actions preventing Timmons-Goodson&#x27;s confirmation created the longest federal court bench vacancy in U.S. history.

In 2016, Burr said he would attempt to block any future Supreme Court nominations made by then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton if she won the presidency in 2016, adding, &quot;I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court.&quot;

Burr voted to confirm Trump&#x27;s Supreme Court nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Two days before Christine Blasey Ford was scheduled to testify before the Senate, Burr issued a statement supporting Kavanaugh&#x27;s nomination despite her testimony. Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were high-school students.

====Privacy and surveillance====
In 2015, as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr proposed a five-year extension of the Patriot Act, which was set to expire in May 2015. Though he originally supported legislation which would reauthorize Patriot Act programs without any reforms, he later softened his position in light of House opposition. Burr was a prominent advocate of retaining language in any reauthorizing legislation to allow the National Security Agency to continue bulk collection of metadata of private telephone records. Ultimately, the Senate rejected controversial amendments in line with Burr&#x27;s proposals introduced by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, signed into law in June 2015, which instead allowed the NSA to subpoena the data from telephone companies.

In 2016, after the FBI–Apple encryption dispute, Burr and Senator Dianne Feinstein circulated a draft bill (which was subsequently leaked) that would create a &quot;backdoor&quot; mandate, requiring technology companies to design encryption so as to provide law enforcement with user data in an &quot;intelligible format&quot; when required to do so by court order.

==== President Trump ====
Burr was a national security adviser to the Trump campaign. He stated that Trump &quot;aligns perfectly&quot; with the Republican Party. When asked on the campaign trail about Trump&#x27;s offensive remarks about women, Burr said Trump should be forgiven a few mistakes and given time to change.

In 2017, Burr said of Trump&#x27;s firing of FBI Director James Comey, &quot;I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order.&quot;

As chair of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Burr led that chamber&#x27;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In March 2017, Comey briefed congressional leaders and Intelligence Committee heads on the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the election. That briefing included &quot;an identification of the principal U.S. subjects of the investigation.&quot; The Mueller report found that Burr had then corresponded with the Trump White House a week later about the Russia probes, with the White House Counsel&#x27;s office, led by Don McGahn, apparently receiving &quot;information about the status of the FBI investigation.&quot;

In December 2019, amid an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the Trump-Ukraine scandal (Trump&#x27;s request that Ukraine announce an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden), Burr pushed the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. Burr said, &quot;There&#x27;s no difference in the way Russia put their feet, early on, on the scale—being for one candidate and everybody called it meddling—and how the Ukrainian officials did it.&quot; During Trump&#x27;s first impeachment trial, Burr said he would oppose removing Trump from office even if a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; was confirmed. He opposed calling Trump&#x27;s former National Security Adviser John Bolton as a witness at the Senate trial; Bolton had written that Trump had tied U.S. security aid to Ukraine to the country&#x27;s taking action against Biden. Burr voted to acquit Trump on the two charges of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power.

On February 9, 2021, Burr voted against the constitutionality of Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial. Nevertheless, on February 13, Burr was one of seven Republicans to vote to convict. On February 16, the North Carolina Republican Party censured him for the vote.

On August 13, 2024, despite having voted to impeach him, Burr said he plans to vote for Trump for president in November.

====Insider trading allegations====

In early February 2020, just before the COVID-19 market crash, Burr sold more than $1.6 million of stock in 33 transactions during a period when, as head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he was being briefed daily regarding potential health threats from COVID-19. He sold 95% of the holdings in his Individual Retirement Account (IRA). According to the FBI, Burr&#x27;s sales six days before &quot;a dramatic and substantial&quot; downturn in the stock market allowed him to profit more than $164,000 and avoid $87,000 in losses. The stocks sold included several considered vulnerable to economic downturns, such as hotel chains. Burr&#x27;s brother-in-law Gerald Fauth also subsequently sold stocks; according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Burr had a 50-second phone conversation with Fauth in February 2020, immediately after which Fauth sold shares.

On March 19, before Burr&#x27;s stock trades were publicly known, NPR reported Burr had warned a private organization in North Carolina on February 27 about the dangers of the virus, likely containment steps, and their extreme economic impacts on stocks and businesses, just two weeks after the stock sale. The advice contradicted his comments in a Fox News op-ed with Lamar Alexander on February 7. The organization he spoke to was Tar Heel Circle, a nonpartisan club of businesses and organizations that costs between $500 and $10,000 to join and assures members &quot;enjoy interaction with top leaders and staff from Congress, the administration, and the private sector.&quot;

Later on March 19, the nonprofit investigative organization ProPublica broke news of Burr&#x27;s stock transactions. When asked for comment, a spokesperson first &quot;express[ed] displeasure with NPR&#x27;s earlier characterizations” of the February 27 Tar Heel Circle event, and later added, &quot;As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.&quot; The &quot;Raleigh News &amp; Observer&quot; editorial board criticized Burr&#x27;s conduct: &quot;Burr had a clear grasp of the danger ahead. Why did he only share it with a group whose member companies… contributed more than $100,000… to Burr’s last re-election campaign? Why didn’t Burr provide his assessment to all the constituents he is supposed to serve, as well as the national media?&quot; Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson called for Burr&#x27;s resignation in the face of the allegations.

The Department of Justice, in coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission, launched a formal probe into the stock sales made during the early days of the coronavirus epidemic by several legislators, including Burr. Burr was also sued by a shareholder for alleged STOCK Act violations.

On May 13, the FBI served a search warrant on Burr at his Washington residence and seized his cellphone. He temporarily stepped down as chair of the Intelligence Committee the next day, taking effect on May 15.

On January 19, 2021, the last full day of the Trump administration, the Justice Department informed Burr that it would not pursue charges against him.

The FBI&#x27;s search warrant affidavit was partially unsealed in September 2022, after litigation by the Los Angeles Times and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

Burr was one of only three senators to oppose the STOCK Act of 2012, which prohibits members of Congress and congressional staff from using nonpublic information in securities trading.

====2021 storming of the United States Capitol====
On May 28, 2021, Burr abstained from voting on the creation of an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

Burr&#x27;s car, a 1973 Volkswagen Thing, is &quot;something of a local celebrity&quot; on Capitol Hill. Burr has a known aversion to reporters, once even climbing out of his office window while carrying his dry cleaning to avoid them. Burr is a member of the United Methodist Church.

Burr has been married to Brooke Fauth Burr, a real estate agent, since 1984, and they have two sons, Tyler and William. Both work for tobacco companies. He is a distant relative of 19th century vice-president Aaron Burr, as a descendant of one of Aaron Burr&#x27;s brothers.

Post-Congressional career

Upon leaving Congress, Burr took a job at law firm DLA Piper as a principal policy advisor and chair of the Health Policy Strategic Consulting Practice.

<text>Soyuz TM-2 was a crewed spaceflight to the Soviet space station Mir, which was uncrewed at the time. TM-2 was launched on February 5, 1987, and it was first crewed spaceflight of the Soyuz-TM spacecraft, and the second crewed spaceflight to Mir (the first being Soyuz T-15). The crew of the long duration expedition, Mir EO-2, who were launched by TM-2 consisted of Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin.

The spacecraft remained docked to Mir, functioning as a lifeboat for the EO-2 crew, until July 1987 when it returned to Earth carrying Laveykin and the two man crew of Mir EP-1. Romanenko later returned to Earth in Soyuz TM-3 at the end of EO-2.

==Crew==
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 7100 kg
*Perigee: 341 km
*Apogee: 365 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 91.6 minutes

==Mission highlights==
Early in the expedition EO-2, the module Kvant-1 was launched to automatically dock with Mir. The docking system, known as the &quot;Igla system&quot;, was not behaving as expected. On April 5 the EO-2 crew retreated to the Soyuz TM-2 spacecraft so that they could escape in the event the module got out of control. About 200 m out, the docking system lost its lock on Mir&#x27;s aft port antenna. The cosmonauts watched from within Soyuz TM-2 as the Kvant/ FSM combination passed within 10 m of the station. Following an emergency spacewalk, Kvant fully docked to the station on April 11.

<text>Alfred Leopold Isidor Kubin (10 April 1877 – 20 August 1959) was an Austrian artist, printmaker, illustrator, and occasional writer. Kubin is considered an important representative of Symbolism and Expressionism.

== Biography ==
Kubin was born in Bohemia in the town of Leitmeritz in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Litoměřice). From 1892 to 1896, he was apprenticed to the landscape photographer Alois Beer, although he learned little. In 1896, he attempted suicide on his mother&#x27;s grave, and his short stint in the Austrian army the following year ended with a nervous breakdown. In 1898, Kubin began a period of artistic study at a private academy run by the painter Ludwig Schmitt-Reutte, before enrolling at the Munich Academy in 1899, without finishing his studies there. In Munich, Kubin discovered the works of Odilon Redon, Edvard Munch, James Ensor, Henry de Groux, and Félicien Rops. He was profoundly affected by the prints of Max Klinger, and later recounted: &quot;Here a new art was thrown open to me, which offered free play for the imaginative expression of every conceivable world of feeling. Before putting the engravings away I swore that I would dedicate my life to the creation of similar works&quot;. The aquatint technique used by Klinger and Goya influenced the style of his works of this period, which are mainly ink and wash drawings of fantastical, often macabre subjects. 

In 1902, Kubin exhibited at the prestigious Cassirer Gallery in Berlin. Soon after, having met the publisher Hans von Weber in Munich in 1901, in 1903 the Hans von Weber Portfolio reproduced 15 of Kubin’s works on paper as prints, which allowed a wider distribution of his work, and established his fame. According to one contemporary critic, Kubin’s work occupied &quot;the darkroom of the modern soul”.

Kubin produced a small number of oil paintings in the years between 1902 and 1910, but thereafter his output consisted of pen and ink drawings, watercolors, and lithographs. In 1911, he became associated with the &quot;Blaue Reiter&quot; group, and exhibited with them in the &quot;Galerie Der Sturm&quot; in Berlin in 1913. After that time, he lost contact with the artistic avant-garde.

Kubin is considered an important representative of Symbolism and Expressionism and is noted for dark, spectral, symbolic fantasies, often assembled into thematic series of drawings. Like Oskar Kokoschka and Albert Paris Gütersloh, Kubin had both artistic and literary talent. He illustrated works of Edgar Allan Poe, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Fyodor Dostoevsky, among others. Kubin also illustrated the German fantasy magazine &quot;Der Orchideengarten&quot;.

From 1906 until his death, he lived a withdrawn life in a Manor-House on a 12th-century estate in Zwickledt, Upper Austria. In 1938, at the Anschluss of Austria and Nazi Germany, his work was declared entartete Kunst or &quot;degenerate art,&quot; but he managed to continue working during World War II.

== &quot;The Other Side&quot; ==
Kubin&#x27;s only literary work was &quot;Die andere Seite&quot; () (1908), a fantastic novel set in an oppressive imaginary land. The novel has an atmosphere of claustrophobic absurdity similar to the writings of Franz Kafka, who admired the book. The illustrations for the book were originally intended for &quot;The Golem&quot; by Gustav Meyrink, but as that book was delayed, Kubin instead worked his illustrations into his own novel.

&quot;The Other Side&quot; has achieved cult status, receiving praise from Jeff VanderMeer and other writers.

== Nazi-looted art ==
In 2016, the Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus Munich restituted, to the heirs of Max and Hertha Morgenstern, 16 drawings by Kubin which had been sold under duress in Vienna in July 1938 as a result of Nazi persecution of Jews following Austria&#x27;s Anschluss with Nazi Germany. Lenbachhaus had acquired them from Kurt Otte, a Kubin collector in Hamburg in 1971.

The German Lost Art Foundation lists 24 artworks by Kubin in its database, many of which are from the Found-Object Reports from the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden Kupferstichkabinett in Dresden which launched Nazi-era provenance research in 2008.

==Honours and awards==
* City of Vienna Prize for Visual Arts (1950)
* Grand Austrian State Prize for Visual Art (1951)
* Austrian Medal for Science and Art (1957)
* Gustav Klimt badge as an honorary member of the Vienna Secession

<text>Douglas Carmichael &quot;Mike&quot; McIntyre II (; born August 6, 1956) is an American attorney and politician who was first elected to represent North Carolina&#x27;s 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996. He served for 18 years from 1997 to 2015. McIntyre is a Democrat and, during his tenure in the House of Representatives, was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition.

== Personal life ==
Born August 6, 1956, McIntyre attended public schools in his hometown of Lumberton, North Carolina. He demonstrated an interest in leadership through public service at a young age by serving as Student Body Treasurer and later Student Body President of Lumberton High School. During this time, his interest in politics also formed through his services as a page for the North Carolina Senate in 1971 and his selection to attend Boys State in 1973, where he was elected Mayor of his city. He also participated in the Washington Workshops Congressional Seminar in the summer of 1973 and the advanced seminar in 1974. McIntyre graduated from high school in 1974.

A Morehead Scholar at the University of North Carolina, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa as a political science major in 1978 and received his Juris Doctor in 1981. During his senior year of college, the chancellor presented him the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award for best exemplifying &quot;unselfish interest in the welfare of his fellow man&quot; during his collegiate career. While a law student, McIntyre served as one of North Carolina&#x27;s youngest delegates at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in support of Jimmy Carter.

In 1987, McIntyre was chosen as one of the state&#x27;s Five Outstanding Young North Carolinians of the Year by the North Carolina Jaycees. As a strong advocate of issues that impact the family, he was a charter member of both the North Carolina Commission on Children &amp; Youth and the North Carolina Commission on the Family. In 1989, McIntyre earned the Governor&#x27;s Award for Outstanding Volunteer Service for his longtime commitment and work with children and educators as a volunteer in the public school system. Until his election to Congress, McIntyre practiced law in his native Robeson County.

Active in community, church, civic, and professional activities, McIntyre served as a leader in the Lumberton Area Chamber of Commerce, coached three All-American Drug-Free Sports Teams, and has been active in Rotary Club, Boy Scouts, the Parent-Teacher Association, and Young Life. Additionally, he has been a lay leader in the First Presbyterian Church of Lumberton with service as an Elder, Deacon, Sunday school teacher and Chairman of the Weekday School and Day Care Committee. McIntyre married Dee Strickland in June 1982. The couple has two sons, Joshua and Stephen, who both won scholarships to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and are now attorneys.

=== Agriculture and economic development ===
Largely composed of rural communities and farm families, support and representation for farmers and rural economic development is imperative for many constituents in the 7th district. When elected to Congress in 1996, McIntyre obtained a seat on the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture and by retirement was the second highest-ranking member. In 2009, McIntyre was elected Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development, Biotechnology, Specialty Crops, and Foreign Agriculture. Through the years, he also served on the following subcommittees: General Commodities, Livestock and Horticulture; Conservation, Energy and Forestry; Livestock, Rural Development and Credit; Conservation, Credit, Energy and Research. McIntyre additionally served as Chairman of the Rural Caucus Task Force on Jobs, Economic Development and Transportation and later became Co-Chairman of the entire Rural Caucus.

Notably, McIntyre co-authored and co-sponsored legislation with Rep. Bill Jenkins (TN) titled, The Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act, otherwise known as the &quot;tobacco buyout.&quot; This legislation was the result of many years of work in an effort to relieve suffering tobacco farmers and after a long debate, this landmark legislation was signed into law as part of the American Jobs Creation Act in 2004. The tobacco buyout eliminated the quota and price support system that was in place and provided $10.1 billion in payments made over ten years to tobacco quota owners and growers for the elimination of their government created quotas. These payments, known as the Tobacco Transition Payment Program, allowed farmers to reduce debt and diversify or expand operations in tobacco and other farm enterprises such as vineyards. The last payment was made in January, 2014.

Business and economic development was always at the forefront of McIntyre&#x27;s agenda and his work has focused on promoting jobs, workforce development and business opportunities. As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Rural Development, McIntyre supported the Microenterprise Business and Rural Entrepreneur Program to help businesses which employ less than 10 people. He worked closely with USDA Rural Development throughout his years in Congress to bring funding for town halls, public works facilities, day care centers, fire and rescue stations, police departments, courthouses, small businesses, housing assistance, health care facilities, hospitals and other public needs to southeastern North Carolina.

McIntyre also worked on legislation to establish the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission which was signed into law as part of the 2008 Farm Bill. The purpose of the commission is to alleviate poverty and promote economic growth in the most distressed areas of the southeastern United States. The commission awards grants to areas in need to fund projects that meet the criteria for community betterment, including infrastructure, education and training, entrepreneurship, and leadership development.

McIntyre was well known for his coordination of the annual North Carolina Business and Economic Summit in Washington, initially called &quot;The Washington Perspective&quot; and later called &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;, which attracted approximately 250 business, Chamber of Commerce and civic leaders annually in September. These events were co-hosted by two other congressmen originally and currently has almost the entire congressional delegation continuing this popular tradition.

McIntyre has received significant recognition for his work in the agriculture and economic development arenas. He was named as the first recipient ever of an international award in public policy by the International Association of Personnel in Employment Security for his efforts to produce job opportunities and increase worker training. The National Association of Development Organizations honored him for his leadership in regional economic development, and the Southern Economic Development Council has chosen him five times for its Legislative Honor Roll. In 2002, he won the North Carolina Employment Security Advancing Workforce Development Award. McIntyre&#x27;s service to agriculture has been recognized by numerous agricultural organizations including the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, and the AgFirst Farm Credit Bank. In 2007, he was named National Legislator of the Year by the National Farm Service Agency Employees Association. He had received the Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award from the Robeson County Crop Promotion Association in 1998 and subsequently received the North Carolina Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award from the N.C. Farm Bureau in 2014.

=== Coastal communities ===
As the U.S. representative of many coastal communities, McIntyre was instrumental in securing over half a billion dollars in funding to ensure the beaches, waterways, inlets and ports of North Carolina&#x27;s 7th district were adequately maintained. He was founder and co-chairman of the Congressional Waterways Caucus, was co-chairman of the Congressional Boating Caucus, and was a member of the House Coastal Caucus and House Oceans Caucus. For his work on beach and waterway issues, McIntyre was named Coastal Advocate of the Year by the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association; received the Admiral&#x27;s Circle Award from the National Marine Manufacturers Association; received the Conservationist Award from the NC Coastal Land Trust; received the J.W. Pate Award from the Cape Fear River Assembly; and was named Beach Preservationist of the Year by the Oak Island Beach Preservation Society.

=== Constituent services ===
Constituent service was a top priority for McIntyre. Through both the Washington and district offices, McIntyre and his staff worked to help veterans obtain medals earned during their service, assist senior citizens with their social security or Medicare benefits, aid citizens in obtaining a passport for travel, or personally welcome constituents to the nation&#x27;s capital.

McIntyre placed a sign in the entry area of his office that stated: &quot;This Office Belongs to the People of the Seventh Congressional District.&quot;

=== Healthcare ===
During his time in office, McIntyre was a member and former co-chairman of the House Rural Health Care Coalition which advocates for advancing rural priorities in health care. Additionally, he was a member of several Congressional caucuses that worked to prevent disease and secure research funding including the Congressional Community Pharmacy Caucus, Congressional Diabetes Caucus, the House Cancer Caucus, the House Vision Caucus, and the Youth Sports Caucus.

For his work on rural health care initiatives, McIntyre has been named a &quot;Super Hero&quot; six times by the National Association of Community Health Centers. He was also presented with the National Rural Health Association’s Legislative award in 2000 (as one of five Representatives) and in 2003 (as the only Representative) for demonstrating great dedication to the health of rural Americans.

=== Military and veterans&#x27; affairs ===
Working on legislation to support the nation&#x27;s armed forces was of particular importance to McIntyre, who represented a district that initially was home to four major military bases, Camp Lejeune, New River Air Station, Fort Bragg, and Pope Air Force Base, as well as Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, three Coast Guard stations and several National Guard armories. McIntyre served on the House Armed Services Committee for the duration of his time in office and was the third highest-ranking member by retirement. He was Vice-Chairman of the Special Oversight Panel on Terrorism, the top Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, and a member of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces.

McIntyre was Co-Founder and Co-Chairman of the Special Operations Forces Caucus, which was started in an effort to recognize the critical role that Special Operations Forces and the U.S. Special Operations Command have in national security missions. For his work, McIntyre has been recognized by the Air Force Association, American Legion, Association of the U.S. Army, Disabled American Veterans, Navy League, Special Forces Charitable Trust, and the VFW. He received the Charles Dick Medal of Merit Award from the North Carolina National Guard in the year 2000 for his strong support of the National Guard and national defense. He has also been inducted as an Honorary Member of the Fleet Reserve Command, made an Honorary Life Member of the N.C. Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America, and presented the Distinguished Public Service Award from the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, its highest civilian honor.

During his tenure in Congress, McIntyre helped secure funds for several new Veterans Affairs clinics, including a dialysis center in Fayetteville, N.C. He successfully advocated for the establishment of two additional veterans&#x27; health clinics in Robeson and Brunswick counties, as well as the building of a new veterans regional health center in Wilmington. McIntyre was awarded National Legislator of the Year in 2008 and the All-American Hero Award in 2009 and 2013 for work advocating on behalf of veterans, including support of an annual Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill that adequately meets the needs of veterans. He supported the authorization for the construction nationally of five new polytrauma centers and three Centers of Excellence in Mental Health, and was also an original co-sponsor of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, which was passed by the U.S. House and provides outreach, education, and training to VA staff to ensure that veterans are receiving adequate mental health care.

=== NASA ===
McIntyre has always been a supporter of NASA and the space program, stating the following: &quot;Not only does space exploration inspire and excite, but it also has numerous practical benefits to people everywhere: from GPS to pacemakers; from microwave ovens to highly advanced computing systems; from water purification to search and rescue missions; from cancer therapy to robotics; from lightweight, durable metals to power generation of energy and telecommunications; from solar cells and batteries to recycling and waste management. Technological improvements affecting weather predictions, storm monitoring, agricultural production and global transportation have greatly affected our lives and helped our environment on earth. Fascination with the vastness of God&#x27;s creation and the make-up of the universe is a never-ending discovery that always inspires us and advances our ingenuity and imagination and increases greatly our education in so many fields of learning and human endeavor. Indeed, there are no limits to space exploration and the discoveries made by the human spirit.&quot;

=== Senior citizens ===
McIntyre was recognized with a pair of boxing gloves from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare because of his advocacy work on behalf of senior citizens. He also received the M.V.P. Award for the entire Congress from the TREA Senior Citizens League in 2004 and later received the Seniors Advocate Award for his legislative leadership on behalf of seniors in 2012.

=== Youth sports ===
Advocacy for youth sports was a priority during McIntyre&#x27;s congressional career. He coached youth sports in Robeson County for several years in T-ball, baseball, football, and basketball, including three All-American Drug-Free teams. McIntyre was the first volunteer coach in the county to be certified by the National Youth Sports Coaches Association and the first to qualify his teams for the All-American Drug-Free Team based on character development and drug education and awareness. He was a charter member of, and helped to incorporate, the Lumberton Youth Baseball Association, which has subsequently spawned several championship teams on the regional, state, and national levels.

Congressman McIntyre is the Founder and Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Youth Sports. Through cooperative efforts with the Citizenship through Sports Alliance, McIntyre and former NBA star Clark Kellogg, now a CBS Sports analyst and commentator, presented a National Report Card on the State of Youth Sports in 2005 at the National Press Club in Washington. Their goal was to draw attention to the need for greater respect, cooperation, discipline, and commitment to youth sports. Having introduced a Youth Sports Legislative Agenda, McIntyre has also hosted three regional youth sports conferences and has worked with the NFL, NBA, NHL, PGA, NCAA, U.S. Soccer, U.S. Tennis and the U.S. Olympic Committee in promoting youth sports, fitness, and recreation nationally.

Congressman McIntyre has received several honors and recognitions in the area of youth sports. He was honored with the National Congressional Award in 2006 by the National Recreation and Park Association for his leadership in promoting youth sports and recreational programs. He was also recognized by the Positive Coaching Alliance for his promotion of teamwork, commitment, persistence, empathy, and leadership among young athletes. In 2008, he was named an International Sports Ethics Fellow by the Institute for International Sport in recognition of his leadership through positive example. His selection placed him among a unique group of sports celebrities such as Grant Hill, David Robinson, Mia Hamm, and Jeff Gordon.

Congressman McIntyre also played sports throughout his years in Congress. He played second base on the Congressional Baseball Team for a number of years, participated in Congressional Basketball and Football Games, as well as tennis, soccer and golf matches. These charitable events benefitted organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs, the Literary Council, and efforts to fight breast cancer, prostate cancer, and homelessness. In 2012, he earned his black belt in Taekwondo from Grand Master Jhoon Rhee, an instructor of boxing champion Muhammad Ali and martial arts star Bruce Lee. Additionally, he earned the Presidential Champion Gold Award given under a tiered system designed to encourage physical activity and sponsored by the President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.

=== Notable achievements ===

==== Black history celebrations and recognitions ====
Congressman McIntyre had a strong relationship with the African-American community, and he was one of only two congressmen known to both host and sponsor his own event in recognition of Black History Month. Each year he would honor African-American elected officials from all levels of government throughout his district, and he would invite a colleague from the Congressional Black Caucus as his special guest of honor to come to southeastern North Carolina for the celebration, which regularly drew hundreds of attendees over the years. McIntyre also obtained appropriations for expansion of the African-American cultural center in Robeson County, where many of the celebrations were held. He was honored for his work by several African-American churches and communities through the years.

==== Lumbee recognition bills ====
McIntyre was a well-known champion of the fight for federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe, which has its tribal headquarters in his home county of Robeson and is the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River. Twice McIntyre successfully shepherded federal recognition bills through Congress, putting together a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, liberals, moderates and conservatives, after he personally lobbied his colleagues one-by-one. McIntyre argued that recognition for them was a matter of dignity and respect and would help the tribe with funding for education, health care and economic development. The House passed the bill he introduced in 2007 by a veto-proof margin (despite the Bush administration&#x27;s opposition) of two-thirds of the House. The bill passed again in 2009 and was supported by the Obama administration. Both times, however, the Senate failed to bring the measure in that chamber to the floor for a vote.

==== Prayer caucus leadership ====
McIntyre was Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast, which had over 100 members. The caucus met regularly on the first night of each week that Congress was in session—just across the hall from the House chamber to pray for wisdom for decisions to be made that week and to pray for constituents&#x27; needs in their communities back home.

McIntyre also had the opportunity to serve as Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast, which is for current and former Members of Congress. This weekly breakfast is a time when these individuals get together to pray for each other and to hear testimony from a colleague in Congress.

In this capacity, McIntyre has also spoken briefly at the National Prayer Breakfast, which has occurred every year with every President since Eisenhower. Nearly 3000 lay leaders, clergy, business leaders and other citizens join various world leaders, the Joint Chiefs of Staff from the Pentagon, Senators, Members of Congress and other persons from the three branches of government, gathered in Washington for this event on the first Thursday in February.

At the National Day of Prayer Ceremony on Capitol Hill, which occurs on the first Thursday in May in conjunction with the national celebration, McIntyre was invited twice to speak on behalf of the Legislative Branch of Government.

In 2006 the Center for Christian Statesmanship selected him as the Distinguished Christian Statesman of the Year for &quot;his character, leadership, integrity and faithfulness in public service.&quot;

==== Scottish-American relations ====
North Carolina&#x27;s 7th district includes the largest number of Scottish-American descendants in the United States. McIntyre co-founded and co-chaired the Friends of Scotland caucus and was the original sponsor of the unanimously passed H.Res. 41 &quot;Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a day should be established as &#x27;National Tartan Day&#x27; to recognize the outstanding achievements and contributions made by Scottish-Americans to the United States.&quot;

In 2008, McIntyre came to the rescue for Scottish literature and poetry when it was discovered that the Library of Congress had made changes to its world renowned classification system, removing 40 headings and subheadings for Scottish writing and moving the body of work under the &quot;English&quot; classification heading. This move garnered concerns and protests from academics, writers, government ministers and many others. First Minister Alex Salmond discussed the matter with McIntyre while he was en route to Scotland on Armed Services business. The Washington Post noted that Linda Fabiani, the Minister of Culture in Edinburgh also lobbied McIntyre while he was visiting the country to see what he could do. Within the scope of a few phone calls, the changes were reversed by the Library of Congress and the Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, issued a letter to the National Library of Scotland.

As a token of gratitude for McIntyre&#x27;s leadership during his Congressional career, the Scottish Parliament passed a motion (S4M-10778) on December 8, 2014 at the First Minister&#x27;s request, recognizing McIntyre&#x27;s contributions to Scotland&#x27;s relationship with the United States and congratulating him on his retirement from Congress.

==== Youth initiatives and volunteering in schools ====
The Seventh Congressional District Annual Youth Leadership Summit, which McIntyre organized and hosted, has been recognized by educators, young people and their parents alike. McIntyre invited all public and private schools in his district to send an outstanding junior to a one-day seminar to discuss issues that affected their communities and also to propose ways in which to resolve them, encouraging the students to have a direct impact on their local communities.

In addition, McIntyre was well known for his school volunteer work, which started when he first began his law career in 1981 when he organized the Robeson County Bar Association&#x27;s Citizenship Education Committee. He continued throughout his congressional career to volunteer in the schools and has done so for over 35 years. From the Washington Workshops Foundation to the John C. Stennis Program for Congressional Interns on Capitol Hill, from elementary schools to graduate &amp; professional schools, from hosting students in his office, to being invited as a freshman his first year in office to the Presidents&#x27; Summit for America&#x27;s Future because of his long history of involvement in helping young people, McIntyre&#x27;s work with youth and his inspirational speeches to school assemblies, in the classrooms and at events on Capitol Hill have reached thousands of students for more than three decades. He was recognized for his work with educators and youth prior to serving in Congress in 1989 with the Governor&#x27;s Award for Outstanding Volunteer Service and during his congressional career with the North Carolina Parent – Teachers&#x27; Association (PTA) bestowing upon him an honorary life membership.

==Electoral history==

















== Post-congressional activity ==
Upon his retirement from Congress, McIntyre joined Poyner Spruill law firm in Raleigh, North Carolina, as Senior Advisor and Director of Government Relations, concentrating on business and economic development, as well as working with a variety of clients on various government relations matters on the federal, state, regional, and local levels.

In 2017, McIntyre worked with the North Carolina Bar Association to develop the Youth Leadership Challenge program which provides opportunities for civic engagement and community leadership to high school students. An earmarked contribution from McIntyre&#x27;s congressional campaign fund for the North Carolina Bar Foundation Endowment made this initiative possible.

Additionally, McIntyre assisted in establishing a new mentoring program through the UNC Christian Legal Society called, The McIntyre-Whichard Legal Fellows Program. Named in honor of McIntyre and former North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Willis Whichard, the program pairs UNC law students with legal professionals in the community for a year-long mentorship which focuses on professional and spiritual growth. The inaugural class of McIntyre-Whichard Legal Fellows commenced during the 2016–17 academic year.

In June 2018, McIntyre was the recipient of The Chief Justice I. Beverly Lake Jr. Public Service Award given by the North Carolina Bar Association, honoring his commitment to public service throughout his life. The award recognizes an outstanding lawyer in North Carolina who has performed exemplary public service and is &quot;reserved for those persons, families or organizations whose contributions are significant, whose conduct is consonant with the NCBA&#x27;s and NCBF&#x27;s stated mission and who are highly regarded by the legal community and the public.&quot;

For McIntyre&#x27;s accomplishments and contributions to enhance UNC&#x27;s School of Law and the profession more broadly, the UNC Law Alumni Association presented him with the Distinguished Alumni Award in 2019. The award &quot;recognizes members of the UNC School of Law community who embody the law school’s mission to serve the legal profession, the people and institutions of North Carolina, the nation and the world with ethics and dedication to the cause of justice.&quot;

During the spring semester of 2019, McIntyre served as a Fellow with the UNC Institute of Politics (IOP). The program allows fellows to independently lead a series of non-credit seminars on relevant issues of national importance. The seminars are open to all UNC students. McIntyre&#x27;s syllabus included topics such as leadership, civic engagement in the community, and public service through political involvement with an emphasis on recognizing the importance of the community in which one serves.

McIntyre was also named an honoree for North Carolina Lawyers Weekly&#x27;s 2019 &quot;Leaders In Law&quot; award and named &quot;Lawyer of the Year&quot; during the award ceremony held on October 25. The Leaders in Law program recognizes practicing legal professionals in the state of North Carolina who go above and beyond in their profession and community. Honorees are selected by a panel of independent legal professionals based on professional and personal accomplishment as well as community involvement. The Lawyer of the Year is presented to the honoree with the highest overall score from the judges.

In 2020, McIntyre was selected to receive the Liberty Bell Award by the Young Lawyers Division of the North Carolina Bar Association for his &quot;commitment to strengthening democracy and promoting civic engagement.&quot; The award is given annually as part of Law Day to an &quot;individual who has strengthened the American system of freedom under the law.&quot; The North Carolina Bar Association celebrates Law Day on the first Friday in May, however events in 2020 were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 crisis. Previous recipients of the Liberty Bell Award include twelve judges, five chief justices, a U.S. senator and two governors.

On September 21, 2020, it was announced that McIntyre would join the Ward and Smith law firm as Senior Advisor for Government Relations and Economic Development. He is based in the firm&#x27;s Raleigh office and works on behalf of clients across North Carolina and in Washington, D.C.

The North Carolina State Bar Council awarded McIntyre the John B. McMillan Distinguished Service Award in January, 2021 in recognition for his efforts to enhance and strengthen legal education, to further the public&#x27;s understanding of and confidence in the rule of law and the justice system, and to encourage professionalism among Bar members. McIntyre was additionally commended for his significant contributions to assuring equal access to the judicial system and improving the quality of services rendered by the law profession.

In 2021, the UNC Chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha (the national political science honor society) invited McIntyre to become an Honorary Member in recognition of his support of and engagement with the UNC Department of Political Science. In addition to being an alumnus of the department and a graduate of the UNC School of Law, McIntyre has become increasingly involved in the education of undergraduate and graduate students at the university through semester long seminars and the establishment of a mentorship program as noted above. For this service to the University, his work while serving in Congress, and his dedication to improving the state of North Carolina, McIntyre was also one of that year&#x27;s inductees into UNC&#x27;s Order of the Golden Fleece, its oldest and highest honorary society.
In 2023, McIntyre was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by his alma mater, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The announcement of this recognition included praise for his community and public service, as well as the positive impact his work had, both internationally and in North Carolina.

McIntyre was recently selected as the 2024 awardee of the H. Brent McKnight Renaissance Lawyer Award by the North Carolina Bar Association at its Annual Meeting in Charlotte. The award recognizes practicing North Carolina attorneys who demonstrate the &quot;Renaissance Lawyer&quot; qualities embodied by Judge McKnight including &quot;trustworthiness, respectful and courteous treatment of all people, enthusiasm for intellectual achievement and commitment to excellence in work, and service to the profession and community during a multi-faceted, accomplished life.&quot; The breadth of McIntyre&#x27;s contributions through community, church, civic, and professional service were emphasized in remarks made by Gill Beck, Chair of the NCBA Professionalism Committee, who presented the award.

During the 2024 Annual Fall Conference of the North Carolina Beach, Inlet, and Waterway Association, McIntyre was presented with the organization&#x27;s Hero of the Coast Award. This award &quot;recognizes individuals or organizations who exemplify determination, leadership, and passion in advancing the mission of protecting North Carolina&#x27;s coastline.&quot; As one of only three recipients ever of this award, McIntyre was recognized for his dedication to ensuring long-term coastal preservation in North Carolina communities throughout his congressional and post-congressional career.

She was the first Republican woman to represent North Carolina in Congress. On February 7, 2012, she announced that she was retiring. She left Congress in January 2013 and was succeeded by Robert Pittenger.

Myrick&#x27;s son Dan Forest was the 34th Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Myrick was born in 1941 in Tiffin, Ohio. She graduated from Port Clinton High School in Port Clinton, Ottawa County, Ohio. She attended Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Seneca County, Ohio between 1959 and 1960. Prior to going into public relations and advertising, she was a Sunday School Teacher. She is the former President and CEO of Myrick Advertising and Public Relations and Myrick Enterprises.

==Charlotte city politics==
Myrick ran for a seat on the Charlotte City Council unsuccessfully in 1981. In 1983, she was elected to an At-Large District of the City Council and served until 1985. In 1987, she was elected as the first female Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1989, when Sue Myrick was running for re-election as mayor of Charlotte, NC, she confessed to having had a relationship with her husband in 1973 while he was still married to his former wife. (She went on to win the election.) 

==1992 U.S. Senate election==

In 1992, she ran for the nomination for a U.S. Senate seat, held by incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Terry Sanford. The Republican primary was won by Lauch Faircloth, who defeated Myrick and former U.S. Representative Walter Johnston 48%–30%–17%.

<text>Soyuz TM-3 was the third crewed spaceflight to visit the Soviet space station Mir, following Soyuz T-15 and Soyuz TM-2. It was launched in July 1987, during the long duration expedition Mir EO-2, and acted as a lifeboat for the second segment of that expedition. There were three people aboard the spacecraft at launch, including the two man crew of the week-long mission Mir EP-1, consisting of Soviet cosmonaut Aleksandr Viktorenko and Syrian Muhammed Faris. Faris was the first Syrian to travel to space, and as of June 2021, the only one. The third cosmonaut launched was Aleksandr Aleksandrov, who would replace one of the long duration crew members Aleksandr Laveykin of Mir EO-2. Laveykin had been diagnosed by ground-based doctors to have minor heart problems, so he returned to Earth with the EP-1 crew in Soyuz TM-2.

Soyuz TM-3 landed near the end of December 1987, landing both members of the EO-2 crew, as well as potential Buran pilot Anatoli Levchenko, who had been launched to Mir a week earlier aboard Soyuz TM-4.

<text>Thomas Cass Ballenger (December 6, 1926 – February 18, 2015) was an American politician. A Republican, he represented North Carolina&#x27;s 10th congressional district, centered in the foothills of North Carolina, in the United States House of Representatives from 1986 to 2005.

==Biography==
Ballenger represented the 10th congressional district of North Carolina from 1986 to 2005. He was also the founder and former chairman of the board of Plastic Packaging, Inc., a manufacturing company with plants in Hickory and Forest City. He also served in the North Carolina Senate (1977–1986), the North Carolina House of Representatives (1975–1977) and on the Catawba County Board of Commissioners (1966–1974). In 38 consecutive years in elective office, serving at the local, state and federal levels, Ballenger never lost an election.

He was a member of the Republican leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, serving as a deputy whip and as a member of the House Steering Committee. He was also a member of the board of directors of the National Council on the Arts.

During Ballenger&#x27;s time in the U.S. Congress, he was a renowned expert on business issues and foreign affairs, especially on issues dealing with Central and South America. Ballenger served on the Committee on Education and the Workforce and as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. During his chairmanship, he authored legislation, which was later enacted, to reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to make it less adversarial and more collaborative while still ensuring worker safety. It was the first major legislative revision to OSHA workplace rules since the agency was created.

Other notable legislation Ballenger authored included a bill making the use of hypodermic needles safer for healthcare workers and a bill to designate Wilson Creek in Caldwell County a Wild and Scenic River. He secured major funding for the completion of US321 between Hickory and Gastonia, and also established the Future Forward Economic Alliance, a regional economic development initiative serving 11 counties in western North Carolina. Through Future Forward, Ballenger led the effort to secure funding to create the North Carolina Center for Engineering Technologies in Hickory. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Hickory Metro Higher Education Center (now the Appalachian State University Center at Hickory.)

He also served on the International Relations Committee and as Chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, where he worked to promote democracy and human rights, fight poverty and improve relations with developing countries in Central and South America.

In 1990, he and his wife Donna founded the Ballenger Foundation to continue their longtime charitable work in Central America. They established several medical clinics in high-poverty locations, sponsored an orphanage, sent school furniture and textbooks and delivered loads of other relief supplies. Their efforts began after the devastating earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua, in 1972 and continued for decades thereafter.

Ballenger prioritized constituent service in the U.S. House of Representatives. A Comprehensive Guide to Constituent Service, his benchmark publication, is still updated for each new Congress and used to train new congressional staff members.

As a member of the North Carolina Senate and former Minority Leader, he introduced the government in the Sunshine Act of 1976, which was enacted into law. It was the first substantive Open Meetings law enacted in North Carolina. He also authored legislation, known as the Ridge Law, to protect scenic vistas in the North Carolina mountains. He was recognized as the Most Effective Republican Legislator by the North Carolina Institute of Government in 1981.

Ballenger previously served as Chairman of the Catawba County Board of Commissioners and was recognized as North Carolina&#x27;s County Commissioner of the Year in 1974. Both Catawba Memorial Hospital (now Catawba Valley Medical Center) and Catawba Valley Community College (formerly Catawba Valley Technical Institute) were established during his two terms as a County Commissioner.

He was at one time Chairman of the Catawba County Republican Party and also served on the Jim Martin for Governor Steering Committee; the North Carolina Reagan-Bush Campaign (Western Co-Chairman, 1984); and was a co-founder and former chairman of the North Carolina Legislative Forum.

He was active in many community organizations, including the Community Ridge Day Care Center in Hickory (co-founder); Greater Hickory United Fund (Chairman); Western Piedmont Council of Governments (Board Chairman); Greater Hickory Chamber of Commerce (Director); the North Carolina School of the Arts (Sustaining Member); the North Carolina Symphony (Patron) and the North Carolina Arts Society (Patron).

He also served on the board of development and board of directors at Lenoir-Rhyne College; the board of directors for the Salvation Army and the board of trustees for the Florence Crittenton Home.

After graduating from Episcopal High School, he attended the University of North Carolina and later received a liberal arts degree from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he was initiated into the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity. He served in the U.S. Naval Air Corps during World War II. He also volunteered as a lay reader for the Episcopal Diocese of Western North Carolina, traveling to lead services in parishes without rectors. He was a longtime active member of the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in Hickory.

Ballenger retired in 2004 and was succeeded by one-term Republican state representative Patrick McHenry.

Ballenger died on February 18, 2015, aged 88.

Ballenger was the great-great-grandson of Lewis Cass, a former U.S. senator, Secretary of State, and Democratic presidential nominee in 1848.

<text>Geeshie Wiley was an American country blues singer and guitar player who recorded six songs for Paramount Records, issued on three records in April 1930. According to the blues historian Don Kent, Wiley &quot;may well have been the rural South&#x27;s greatest female blues singer and musician&quot;. Little is known of her life, and there are no known photographs of her. She may have been born Lillie Mae Boone (November 14, 1908–July 29, 1950), later Lillie Mae Scott.

==Recordings==
In April 1930, Wiley traveled with the singer and guitarist Elvie Thomas from Houston, Texas to Grafton, Wisconsin, to make recordings for Paramount Records. Wiley recorded &quot;Last Kind Words Blues&quot; and &quot;Skinny Leg Blues&quot;, singing and accompanying herself on guitar, with Thomas providing additional guitar accompaniment. Thomas also recorded two songs, &quot;Motherless Child Blues&quot; and &quot;Over to My House,&quot; with Wiley playing guitar and singing harmony. Some sources suggest that in March 1931 Wiley and Thomas returned to Grafton and recorded &quot;Pick Poor Robin Clean&quot; and &quot;Eagles on a Half.&quot;

Steve Leggett at Allmusic states, &quot;Wiley&#x27;s vocal on &quot;Last Kind Word Blues&quot; is by turns weary, wise, angry, defiant, despairing, even wistful, and is simply one of the best performances in early country blues.&quot;

It is believed that fewer than ten original copies of Wiley&#x27;s records have survived.

==Biographical uncertainties==

Little is known about Wiley, and the few details of her life provided by various sources are inconsistent. &quot;Geeshie&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Geechie&quot; or &quot;Geetchie&quot;) was probably a nickname.

There have been several conjectures about her life. The musician Ishmon Bracey, a contemporary of Wiley&#x27;s, stated that she came from Natchez, Mississippi, and was romantically linked with the Delta blues musician Papa Charlie McCoy. It has also been suggested that in the 1920s she worked in a medicine show in Jackson, Mississippi, and that she may have married Casey Bill Weldon after his divorce from Memphis Minnie. The singer and bass player Herbert Wiley, of Oxford, Mississippi, stated that she was a cousin on his father&#x27;s side and that her family had farmed in South Carolina; his father had told him that she died in 1938 or 1939, and he believed that she may have been buried in the family burial plot in Oxford. The musicologist and genealogist Eric S. LeBlanc suggested that her name was Wadie May Wiley and that she was born near Oxford in 1906.

Research by Robert &quot;Mack&quot; McCormick was developed and publicized by John Jeremiah Sullivan in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2014. McCormick told Sullivan that he had visited Wiley&#x27;s former home and spoken to members of her immediate family when he was conducting fieldwork in Oklahoma in the 1950s. McCormick also interviewed Wiley&#x27;s recording partner, L. V. &quot;Elvie&quot; Thomas, in Texas in 1961. Thomas began performing with Wiley in the early 1920s and remembered her as Lillie Mae Wiley; she claimed to have given Wiley her nickname. The nickname &quot;Geechie&quot; (spelled in various ways) was common among people from around coastal South Carolina and Georgia (it is also an alternate name for the Gullah ethnic group of that region), but more generally was an affectionate nickname for a young woman of rural origins in the American South. Thomas said that a few years before the interview (that is, in the 1950s) she had heard that Wiley was living in West Texas. Later research reported by Sullivan suggests that Wiley was born in Louisiana on November 14, 1908, and that she was the same Lillie Mae Scott who stabbed her husband, Thornton Wiley, to death in Houston in 1931. Wiley was nonetheless performing again with Thomas about 1933, on their last tour together. According to McCormick, Thomas said, &quot;I haven’t seen [Wiley] since 1933. I left her in Chico, Oklahoma [presumably Checotah]. ... We’d gone out playing around together, traveling, and I left her up there and came on back.&quot; Sullivan also spoke to a Houston musician, John D. &quot;Don&quot; Wilkerson, who claimed to remember Wiley and &quot;implied that there was something funny about her background. He said that she&#x27;d been &#x27;maybe Mexican or something.&#x27;”

According to researcher Caitlin Love, who worked with Sullivan, Lillie Mae Wiley ( Boone) died from a head injury in 1950, and was buried with her mother Cathrine Nixson in Brushy Cemetery in Burleson County, Texas.

==Legacy==
&quot;Last Kind Words&quot;, &quot;Motherless Child Blues&quot;, &quot;Skinny Legs Blues&quot;, and &quot;Pick Poor Robin Clean&quot; are included on the compilation album &quot;Mississippi Masters: Early American Blues Classics 1927–35&quot; (Yazoo Records, 2007).

In the documentary film &quot;Crumb&quot; (1994), by Terry Zwigoff, the artist Robert Crumb plays Wiley&#x27;s recording of &quot;Last Kind Words Blues&quot; and sits down to listen as a sequence of his cartoons is shown.

&quot;Last Kind Words Blues&quot; has been covered by several other artists:

*David Johansen and the Harry Smiths covered it on their 2002 album &quot;Shaker&quot;. Johansen also sang a portion of &quot;Last Kind Words&quot; in the movie &quot;Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus&quot; (2003).
*C. W. Stoneking included a faithful cover of the song on his 2006 album &quot;Mississippi &amp; Piedmont Blues 1927–1941.&quot;
*Dex Romweber Duo released a version featuring Jack White, on White&#x27;s vinyl-only label, Third Man Records.
*Ransom Riggs used the song in his video &quot;Talking Pictures&quot;, in which he talks about vintage photographs.
*Rhiannon Giddens, of the traditional black music group Carolina Chocolate Drops, sang the song on her solo debut album, &quot;Tomorrow Is My Turn&quot;.
*The Kronos Quartet performed an arrangement of the song at their fortieth anniversary concert, broadcast in 2013.
*Hogan &amp; Moss recorded their version of &quot;Last Kind Words&quot; in 2016 on the album &quot;You&#x27;ve Been That Friend To Me.&quot;
* &quot;Last Kind Words Blues&quot; appeared on the Robert Plant / Alison Krauss album &quot;Raise the Roof&quot;, released in November 2021.

<doc id="850199" wikidata="Q688148" url="?curid=850199" title="Pilatus PC-7">
<text>The Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer is a low-wing tandem-seat training aircraft, designed and manufactured in Switzerland by Pilatus Aircraft. The aircraft is capable of all basic training functions, including aerobatics, instrument, tactical, and night flying.

The PC-7 was developed from the preceding piston-powered Pilatus P-3, largely differing by the adoption of a turboprop engine, a bubble canopy, and a new one-piece wing. Introduced during the 1970s, it has since developed a sizable presence of the global trainer market. The type has been adopted by in excess of twenty air forces as their ab initio trainer, as well as multiple civilian operators. Over one million hours have reportedly been flown by PC-7s worldwide. In addition to training operations, some aircraft are armed and have been used for combat missions by several customers, including Chad, Iran, and Mexico, often in violation of the relevant export agreement between the customer and the Swiss government.

An improved model of the aircraft, the PC-7 Mk.II M, was developed during the 1990s, by combining the newer airframe and avionics from the PC-9 with the PC-7&#x27;s smaller turbine engine. Reportedly, in excess of 600 PC-7s have been sold to various operators, the majority of which are in service. In Pilatus&#x27; range of aircraft, the PC-7 has been succeeded by the newer PC-9 and PC-21 trainers.

==Development==

===Origins===
Work on what would become the PC-7 commenced during the 1960s. It was based on the earlier piston-powered Pilatus P-3, the initial prototype being produced from the existing prototype P-3, principally differing by the substitution of its Lycoming O-435 engine with a Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-20 turboprop power-plant. On , the modified prototype performed its maiden flight. However, the PC-7 programme was abruptly shelved following an accident involving the aircraft. The termination of work was reportedly driven by a lack of market interest.
During 1973, it was decided to restart work on the programme; factors for its revival had included the 1973 oil crisis, the launch of the rival Beechcraft T-34C Turbo-Mentor, and the increasing age of existing trainer aircraft. To support the relaunch, another P-3 was obtained from the Swiss Air Force. After modifications, this aircraft first flew on . Further extensive modifications followed later in the programme, including the adoption of a new one-piece wing complete with integral fuel tanks, along with an altered tail fin and a bubble canopy. The flight test programme came to a close during Autumn 1977.

On , the first production aircraft made its first flight. On 5 December of that year, Switzerland&#x27;s Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) issued civil certification for the PC-7; immediately thereafter, initial deliveries of production aircraft commenced to customers Burma and Bolivia. Over time, sales of the PC-7 generated considerable profits, allowing the company to finance the development of further types of aircraft.

===Further development===
The PC-7 Mk.II M is a development of the PC-9&#x27;s airframe and avionics, which was powered by the PC-7&#x27;s smaller turbine engine, which reportedly achieved lower operating and maintenance costs. This variant was developed at the behest of the South African Air Force (SAAF), who later adopted the type. A batch of 60 PC-7 Mk.II Ms were locally assembled in South Africa using kits supplied by Pilatus for the SAAF; due to political considerations, these aircraft were not fitted with the armament hardpoints. Deliveries to the SAAF took place between late 1994 and 1996.

In addition to Pilatus&#x27; own improvement programmes, several third-party companies have independently developed their own upgrades for customer&#x27;s PC-7. During the late 1990s, Israeli engineering firm Radom began offering a kit of new avionics for the type, which included a new mission computer, a wide-angle head-up display, along with various replacement communications and weapons-delivery systems.

During July 1998, Pilatus announced that it has come to an agreement with American company Western Aircraft, for the latter to act as a distributor for the PC-7 across the North American civil aviation market. At this time, there were already five civil-registered PC-7s in operation in North America; Pilatus believed that the region could be a viable market for both remanufactured and newly built examples of the type, which would be priced between $1 million and $2 million respectively. It was recognised that this market was limited, Western Aircraft expected to sell only a few aircraft per year.

==Operational history==
===General use===
All export sales of the PC-7 are subject to approval by the Swiss Government, whose authorisation is required prior to any delivery taking place. The sale of combat-capable aircraft has been a controversial matter at times, and political pressure has been applied for PC-7s to be shipped without the fittings for armaments being installed. The Swiss government has occasionally held up or outright refused to issue export licences for some nations, a move which has reportedly led to the loss of several potential sales, such as to South Korea and Mexico.
In addition to its adoption by numerous military customers, the PC-7 has also been used by private customers. It has been certified for civil use by both the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as compliant with regulations pertaining to general aviation (GA) operations in both Europe and the United States. Amongst its uses in the civilian sector has been aerobatic displays.

During the 1990s, the PC-7 Mk.II M was adopted as the basic trainer of the Royal Brunei Air Force (RBAirF) alongside the BAE Systems Hawk jet trainer; the acquisition was seen a key to its expanded operations with fixed-wing aircraft.

During June 2011, the Indian Air Force (IAF) selected the PC-7 Mk.II M as its new basic trainer, signing a contract for an initial batch of 75 aircraft, with an option for buying an additional 38 PC-7 Mk.II Ms; the Indian military had a total requirement of 181 trainers. The fast-tracked decision to procure a foreign aircraft over a domestically developed alternative proposed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was a controversial one; retired Air Marshal Anil Chopra argued that HAL had no viable design for the role, and that the IAF could not have reasonably afforded the delay involved in the development of such an aircraft. The procurement of an additional 106 trainers under the &#x27;Make &amp; Buy&#x27; (Indian) category was repeatedly deferred. In 2017, the maintenance agreement with Pilatus lapsed, resulting in the IAF becoming solely responsible for performing these activities. In 2018, India announced that it had chosen to exercise the option of buying a batch of 38 trainers. However, as of 2020, the additional orders for PC-7 airrcaftf from IAF were cancelled in favour of the indigenous HAL HTT-40 from Hindustan Aeronautics, the orders for which was placed in 2022.

===Combat use===
A number of PC-7s were employed by the Guatemalan Air Force in air strikes and for close air support (CAS) during the Guatemalan civil war, starting in 1982, until the end of the conflict in 1996. The PC-7s were typically deployed from the airfield in La Aurora, being armed with a mixture of gun pods and rocket pods.

During the lengthy Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s, amid tensions between Iran and the United States, it is alleged that Iranian officials threatened to arm its PC-7 fleet with explosives and use them to launch suicide attacks against United States Navy (USN) vessels present in the Persian Gulf. Iran reportedly trained a number of suicide pilots and flew some operational missions, training was performed at Bushehr Air Base in Iran and overseas in North Korea. In early 1984, an Iranian attack helicopter AH-1J Sea Cobra was shot down by an Iraqi PC-7 during Operation Khyber (Iranian pilots Reza Moghadam and Mohammad Yazdi were rescued).

In 1994, the Mexican Air Force used several armed PC-7s to attack units of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation during the Chiapas conflict in Mexico. This action was considered illegal by the Swiss government because the aeroplanes were sold for training purposes only, and as result, Switzerland issued a ban on the sale of additional units to Mexico. At the time, the Mexican Air Force was the largest single export operator of the type, and had been seeking to acquire further PC-7s, thus the sales ban was viewed as an economic blow to Pilatus.

During the mid to late 1990s, Executive Outcomes, a private military contractor led by Eeben Barlow, utilised three armed PC-7s (ex-Bophuthatswana Air Force aircraft) to provide close air support (CAS) during its operations in Sierra Leone.

During the late 2000s, the Chadian Air Force reportedly used its small fleet of PC-7s to bomb rebel positions both in their own territory and in neighbouring Sudan. The Swiss government summoned the Chad&#x27;s ambassador to request an explanation for these reports, as these actions breached the export agreements previously struck for the sale of the type to Chad.

==Variants==
*PC-7 : two-seat basic trainer aircraft, powered by PT6A-25A engine rated at .
*PC-7 Mk.II M : a development of the PC-9&#x27;s airframe and avionics, retaining the PC-7&#x27;s wing to mount external stores. Powered by PT6A-25C of rather than more powerful PT6A-62 of PC-9. Developed for the South African Air Force (SAAF), and known as the &#x27;Astra&#x27;; the aircraft is a hybrid PC-7 and PC-9, either a PC-7 &#x27;Heavy&#x27; or a PC-9 &#x27;Lite&#x27;, depending on point of configuration.
* NCPC-7 : upgraded version of the standard PC-7 with fully IFR glass cockpit avionics, developed for the Swiss Air Force. The designation NCPC-7 has been provisionally used in the Swiss Air Force to differentiate modernized PC-7s (NC for New Cockpit) from those which were not yet done. It was removed after the improvement of the last of the 28 aircraft in 2009. Consequently, all the Turbo-Trainer took again the designation PC-7.
* PC-7 WE: upgraded variant of the NCPC-7 for the Swiss Air Force that includes: modification of the communication system, a TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system), ADF system extended (radiocompas), complete disassembly of the avionic and antennas to check for problems, complete disassembly and reassembly of the cables and repairs.
*PC-7 MKX : an updated version of the PC-7 Mk.II, with new avionics, cockpit displays, and integration with the ground-based training system (GBTS). The GBTS includes computer and simulator technology, along with new tools such as virtual reality and mixed reality. PC-7 MKX was announced at the Dubai Airshow in November 2021.

<doc id="850202" wikidata="Q461510" url="?curid=850202" title="Heckler &amp; Koch UMP">
<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch UMP (&quot;Universale Maschinenpistole&quot;, German for &quot;Universal Machine Pistol&quot;) is a submachine gun developed and manufactured by Heckler &amp; Koch. Heckler &amp; Koch developed the UMP as a lighter and cheaper successor to the MP5, though both remain in production. The UMP has been adopted for use by various countries, including Brazil, Canada, and the United States. Some of the weapons saw limited service in the early years of the Iraqi insurgency, making them one of the more popular submachine guns being deployed by the U.S. military personnel in recent conflicts around the world.

The UMP can be converted from 9×19mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W, or .45 ACP by changing the barrel, bolt, and magazine. The UMP was previously available in multiple calibres, however with a decline in global use of .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP, only the 9mm Parabellum variant is in production. Parts are still available for the .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP calibre variants.

== History ==
The UMP was designed in the 1990s by Heckler &amp; Koch (HK), as a cheaper, lighter alternative to the MP5, which made heavy use of polymers. The UMP first entered production in 2000. It was designed primarily for use by American military and law enforcement units, as the MP5 was not available in .45 ACP, a round which was popular in the United States, but not in Europe. Despite the UMP&#x27;s improvements and reduced cost, it did not replace the MP5, which ended up outselling the UMP.

===Recall===
In 2000, H&amp;K recalled certain UMP and USC serial numbers due to faulty operating handles. The faulty handles, made of polymer, could break off, making the weapons inoperable.

==Design details==
The UMP is a blowback-operated, magazine-fed submachine gun that fires from a closed bolt. The closed bolt design increases the accuracy, which is particularly desirable in a law enforcement context. However, the simple blowback design of the UMP makes it less controllable than the MP5.

The UMP was originally designed for larger cartridges such as the .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP, to provide more stopping power against unarmoured targets, with slightly lower effectiveness at longer ranges. A larger cartridge produces more recoil and makes it harder to control in fully automatic fire. To mitigate the excessive recoil, Heckler &amp; Koch designed the UMP to have a cyclic rate of around 600 rounds per minute, though the rate of fire increases up to 700 rounds per minute if (+ P) ammunition is used.

The UMP9 (the 9×19mm variant of the UMP) is almost lighter than the MP5. It has a cyclic rate of around 600–750 rounds per minute. Its predominantly polymer construction reduces both its weight and the number of parts susceptible to corrosion.

The UMP is available in four trigger group configurations, featuring different combinations of semi-automatic, 2-round burst, fully automatic, and safe settings. It features a side-folding buttstock to reduce its length during transport. When the last round of the UMP is fired, the bolt locks open, and can be released via a catch on the left side. The iron sights consist of an aperture rear sight and a front ring with a vertical post. It can mount four Picatinny rails (one on top of the receiver, and one on the right, left, and bottom of the handguard) for mounting accessories such as optical sights, tactical lights, or laser sights. Vertical foregrips can be attached to the bottom rail for better control during burst and automatic fire.

== Variants ==
The UMP is interchangeable between three different calibres:

The UMP9, chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum

The UMP40, chambered in .40 S&amp;W

The UMP45, chambered in .45 ACP

Apart from the different chambering, all versions feature the same design model, the exterior differences being the curved magazine used on the UMP9, while both the UMP40 and UMP45 each use a straight magazine. All three versions of the weapon can be cross-converted to any of the round chamberings by replacing the bolt, barrel, and magazine.

The USC or Universal Self-loading Carbine is a semi-automatic-only variant of the UMP designed for civilian use. It was created following the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 in the United States and was introduced in 2000. Changes from the original UMP include a &quot;thumbhole&quot; type stock/grip instead of the pistol grip of the UMP, a longer barrel without the flash suppressor, a magazine limited to 10 rounds, and a semi-automatic-only trigger group and action. Originally available in grey, as of 2008 the USC came only in an all-black finish.

Production of the USC was halted in 2013. In 2018, H&amp;K announced a limited production run of new USC rifles.

===Clones===
* Omega Gideon Shadow – American clone of the UMP released in 2017.
* Tommy Built Tactical TMP/KSM – American clone of the UMP.
* DefGunz DEF9– American clone of the UMP receiver.

<doc id="850203" wikidata="Q1064695" url="?curid=850203" title="Charles Taylor (North Carolina politician)">
<text>Charles Hart Taylor (born January 23, 1941) is an American politician and businessman who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing North Carolina&#x27;s 11th congressional district from 1991 to 2007.

== Early life and education ==
Taylor was born in Brevard, North Carolina. He attended Wake Forest University, where he received his BA in 1963 and his Juris Doctor from Wake Forest University School of Law in 1966.

==Career==
Taylor served in the North Carolina General Assembly as a Republican from Transylvania County from 1967 to 1975 — serving in the State House from 1967 to 1973 and the State Senate from 1973 to 1975. He then returned to his business interests until entering Congress.

In 1988, Taylor ran against Democratic incumbent Jamie Clarke and lost by just over 1,500 votes. He sought a rematch against Clarke in 1990 and won by 2,700 votes. He was reelected with 54 percent of the vote in 1992, even as Bill Clinton carried the district. He was reelected six more times from the 11th, which includes most of North Carolina&#x27;s share of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

In his first term, as a member of the Gang of Seven, a group of first-term Republican Representatives, Taylor worked to expose the 1992 House banking scandal.

In 2006, Taylor&#x27;s Democratic opponent was Heath Shuler, a native of Swain County and a former quarterback for the University of Tennessee and the Washington Redskins.

Shuler defeated Taylor, earning 54 percent of the vote to Taylor&#x27;s 46 percent. In December 2007, Taylor announced that he would not seek a rematch with Shuler in 2008.

==Positions==
Taylor was one of the most conservative members of the House. He had a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union. He was a member of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative Republican congressmen.

===Environment===
Taylor was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, on the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations.

Taylor served on the advisory board of the National Wilderness Institute, a &quot;deceptively named&quot; pro-timber group which worked to promote timber companies&#x27; private property rights and reduce environmental safeguards.

===Spending===
In 2005 and 2006, Taylor made national headlines for delaying full funding by the federal government for a $60 million memorial to United Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. Taylor&#x27;s preference was for federal funding to be lowered and supplemented by private donations. After pressure from a variety of people, including President George W. Bush, Taylor ended his opposition and allowed funding for the memorial; he had used his Appropriations subcommittee chairmanship to block the funding. At the time of his protest, private donors had only donated $7 million towards the cost, and Taylor feared that the government would be forced to come up with the other $53 million.

Taylor supported spending over $600 million for a road through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to settle a 1943 agreement with the federal government. Proponents of the road argue that if it were built, it would provide better access to ancestral cemeteries inside the park, as well as providing a tourist draw to the region. Critics call the project the &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;, and argue that if the road were built, it would cut through the largest roadless tract east of the Mississippi River; and prefer, instead, a cash settlement with the federal government.

===Free trade===
Taylor had been outspoken in his opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and other trade agreements that he argues would hurt his district, which has suffered from the closing of textile, furniture, and other plants when production has been moved abroad where labor costs are cheaper. However, he failed to register a vote during final approval of the agreement by the House, which passed 217–215. According to GOP aides, Taylor cast a no vote with a deactivated voting card. The glitch registered with the House Clerk&#x27;s office, but Taylor had left the House floor and aides said attempts to locate him during the 62-minute vote were unsuccessful.

===Russian student exchange program===
Taylor started exchange programs for Russian students and internships for aspiring bankers and entrepreneurs in 1994, at colleges in his district.

In 2005, Taylor secured $100,000 in federal money for the International Trade and Small Business Institute, which brings foreign students to the U.S. to study at seven colleges and universities in western North Carolina. The 2007 federal budget contains a $1-million earmark for the program. In August 2006, 20 students arrived in the U.S. to attend six colleges and universities in western North Carolina.

The Russia-based coordinator of the study program is Marina Bolshakova. She and her husband are partners in the Russian bank owned by Taylor, and Taylor&#x27;s Russian investment company. Taylor said Bolshakova earns no salary for her work, calling her a natural choice for the job because of her prior job as an English teacher.

Taylor made 11 trips to Russia between 1997 and 2005 as part of his Congressional travel, paid for by the U.S. government.

=== Iraq ===
In July 2005, at a town hall meeting in his district, when asked about the Iraq War, Taylor mentioned the terrorist bombings in London that occurred the prior week and said &quot;Just like any murderer, they have to be dealt with and justice has to be brought.&quot; American troops, Taylor said, were doing a &quot;job that should be done&quot; in Iraq.

When asked for a time line of when he thought American troops might pull out, Taylor estimated that a reduction in American forces should occur in 2006. But he said American troops could spend another two years in Iraq training the country&#x27;s new army.

Taylor was one of a handful of Congressmen who have had children serve in Iraq. His son Bryan is a US Army Captain who served in Iraq from mid-2004 until late 2005.

==Businesses==
According to &quot;Roll Call&quot;, a Capitol Hill newspaper, Taylor was worth more than $55 million as of the end of 2005, making him one of the wealthiest members of Congress. Taylor founded and remains majority owner/chairman of the board of Blue Ridge Savings Bank in Asheville, NC. In 2006, he reported owning stock in Financial Guaranty Corporation, the holding company for the bank, that was worth more than $50 million. The holding company also owns a Russian bank (see below).

In September 2006, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Taylor one of the &quot;20 most corrupt members of Congress&quot;, saying his ethics issues arose &quot;from his lucrative outside business interests&quot;. Shuler also accused Taylor of using his House seat to enrich himself, claiming that every earmark he placed in a transportation bill was for a project owned either by Taylor or one of his companies. Despite various accusations from political opponents, there were never any charges brought by the House Ethics committee against Taylor.

=== Blue Ridge Savings Bank ===
In January 2005, Hayes Martin, who had been bank president as well as Taylor&#x27;s campaign treasurer, and Charles &quot;Chig&quot; Cagle, a former district Republican chairman who had taken out fraudulent loans from the bank, were sentenced for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Martin pleaded guilty in 2001. During the 2003 trial of attorney Thomas Jones, who handled the closing of the loans, Martin said that Taylor had first-hand knowledge of the loans. Cagle and Jones also said Taylor knew of the fraud.

Taylor has refused to comment on the case. Congressional staff routinely said the fraud was bank business and referred questions to Blue Ridge President Dwayne Wiseman. Following the sentencing, Taylor press secretary Deborah Potter said Taylor still had no comment, and reviewed a statement by Wiseman: &quot;For a number of years there has been an effort on the part of certain political opponents of Congressman Charles Taylor to slander him and Blue Ridge Savings Bank by indicating that neither he nor the bank or any present officers of the bank had any prior knowledge,&quot; Wiseman said in the statement. &quot;This went on for some nine years with the encouragement of the press. We would hope that the settlement of this case would put an end to such speculation.&quot; Taylor was never targeted by authorities as having any involvement in helping Martin defraud Blue Ridge Savings Bank, which Taylor owned.

===Russian investments===
Starting in the mid-1990s, Charles Taylor began financing small businesses in and around Ivanovo, an industrial city of almost 500,000, about northeast of Moscow. In 2003, Taylor purchased the Commercial Bank of Ivanovo with a Russian partner, Boris Bolshakov, a former KGB colonel and Supreme Soviet deputy, and Bolshakov&#x27;s wife Marina. Taylor owns 80 percent of the bank as well as Columbus, a Russian investment company.

In December 2005, the Bank of Ivanovo opened a new four-story headquarters, its second office, in the city&#x27;s downtown. Taylor said at the time that he didn&#x27;t consider the bank to yet be particularly profitable. In mid-2006, Bolshakov said the bank&#x27;s hard currency balance was more than $22 million and its loan portfolio was more than $18.6 million.

One of the 2005 participants in the Russian student exchange program told Associated Press that she had a summer work-study internship at the Bank of Ivanovo after she returned to Russia. Taylor&#x27;s office said that was a mistake because Institute policy forbids participants to work in &quot;any business venture with which Congressman Taylor is associated.&quot; The bank has since ended its participation in the work-study program, Taylor&#x27;s office said.

Bank of Ivanovo had its license revoked on April 5, 2019, by the Central Bank of Russia for regularly breaking anti-money laundering regulations, misrepresenting the size of its provisions and using &quot;schemes&quot; to artificially inflate its capital, according to a central bank statement.

===Cattle and tree farms===
In 2000, Jackson County&#x27;s tax collector asked the U.S. House of Representatives to garnish his wages to collect more than $3,583 in back taxes resulting from a dispute over parcels owned by Transylvania Tree Farms, a Taylor business. The county said that Taylor had failed to file a management plan for his property, despite repeated requests from the county, and so it could not be assessed at a lower rate through a forest land tax deferment. Taylor&#x27;s attorney disputed the authority of the county to require such a plan.

In May 2006, Champion Cattle and Tree Farm, located in Transylvania County, was issued a notice of violation because rental property of the company had become a &quot;public health nuisance.&quot;

Taylor owned on the North Carolina side of Sassafras Mountain, the highest point in South Carolina. In June 2010 it was announced he planned to sell the property to the Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy for $33 million. It had a market value of $63 million and the difference was considered a charitable gift for tax purposes. Most of the property was used to create Headwaters State Forest.

<text>The Mekon ( ) of Mekonta is the arch-enemy of the British comic book hero Dan Dare. He first appeared on 3 November 1950 in the 30th episode of the &quot;Eagle&quot; comic strip &quot;Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future&quot;, having been created by Frank Hampson. Apart from Dan Dare himself, he is the only character to appear in every one of the numerous versions of the comic strip that appeared in the &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;2000 AD&quot; and Virgin Comics. In the 1950s, roughly every other story featured the Mekon.

==Description==
The Mekon was the ruler of the Treens of northern Venus, although he was ousted from this position at the end of the first story and had no fixed base of operations. He was created by scientific experimentation, engineered for very high intelligence. As such he had a swollen head containing his massive brain and atrophied body, and moved around on a levitating chair. He typically invented new superweapons in the pursuit of his goal: the domination of the universe for the purpose of scientific research. In some stories he also sought personal revenge on Dan Dare.

In the animated &quot;Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future&quot; television series (first aired in 2001), the animators took his nickname &quot;Melonhead&quot; literally and showed his cranium as not shiny smooth green but wrinkled like a cantaloupe. The voice of the Mekon for the series was portrayed by Rob Paulsen and by Richard Pearce for several audio drama adaptations.

== In popular culture ==
British politician Angus Maude and Irish journalist Patrick Cosgrave were each nicknamed &quot;The Mekon&quot;. British political strategist Dominic Cummings has also been nicknamed &quot;The Mekon&quot;.

In the &quot;Genesis of A Classic&quot; feature on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; DVD release of &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, producer Philip Hinchcliffe cites the Mekon as one of his inspirations for the character Davros.

Elton John, in his &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; album recorded in 1975, had a song called &quot;Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)&quot;. One of the key repeated lines in the song is &quot;Dan Dare doesn&#x27;t know it, he doesn&#x27;t know it, but I like the Mekon&quot;.

British rock band The Mekons named themselves after the character in 1977, as did big beat artist Mekon.

British satirical magazine Private Eye ran a cartoon strip from 1987 titled &quot;Dan Dire - Pilot of the Future?&quot;, featuring then-Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock as the eponymous hapless space pilot, accompanied by the gluttonous Pigby, modelled on deputy leader Roy Hattersley. Dire&#x27;s arch-enemy was The Maggon, a Mekon-like parody of Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher, whose followers were the Toreens. 
In May 2013, the BBC radio soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot; featured a storyline in which regular character Brian Aldridge was aggrieved by a local newspaper article that compared him to the Mekon.

== Reception ==
The character has been described as very popular with the readers, rivalling in popularity the series protagonist himself. Mekon&#x27;s popularity has inspired the designs of later British fictional villains, such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s Davros and Cybermen.

== Analysis ==
Given the Christian undertones of &quot;Eagle&quot;, the character of Mekon has been compared to Satan, an emobidiment of all evil in the Dan Dare&#x27;s universe. The Mekon has been described as &quot;a rich composite of racial stereotypes&quot;, in particular, the Oriental Yellow Peril. Given that his powers come from his extreme intelligence, hatching plots and inventions (doomsday devices and like), Mekon can also been as an &quot;an expression of the British public&#x27;s growing distrust of the power wielded by science&quot;.

<doc id="850212" wikidata="Q1903813" url="?curid=850212" title="Martin Frost">
<text>Jonas Martin Frost III (born January 1, 1942) is an American politician, who was the Democratic representative to the U.S. House of Representatives for Texas&#x27;s 24th congressional district from 1979 to 2005.

==Personal life==
Frost was born to a Jewish family in Glendale, California, the son of Doris (nee Marwil) and Jack Frost. He has one sister, Carol Frost Wagner. His grandfather, Joe Frost, was co-founder of Frost Brothers Department Store. In 1949, his family moved to Fort Worth, Texas where his father took a job with Convair Aircraft. In 1964, he graduated from the University of Missouri with a bachelor of journalism and a Bachelor of Arts in history. As a student, Frost was editor of &quot;The Maneater&quot;, is a brother of Zeta Beta Tau, and was tapped by Omicron Delta Kappa and QEBH.

After graduating, Frost worked as a newspaper reporter, including positions at &quot;The News Journal&quot; of Wilmington, Delaware. He received his Juris Doctor degree from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1970. Following his graduation he worked as a law clerk for Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes of the Northern District of Texas, after which he practiced law in the Dallas–Fort Worth area. In addition, Frost was a legal commentator on KERA-TV.

Frost served in the United States Army Reserve from 1966 to 1972.

==Political career==
Frost ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House in 1974. He tried again successfully in 1978, becoming the first Jewish U.S. congressman from Texas. Frost was reelected 12 times without serious opposition. In 1980, he defeated an African American Republican opponent, Clay Smothers.

On October 10, 2002, Martin Frost was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

He served two terms as the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus from 1999 to 2003, the number three post in the Democrats&#x27; House leadership after the minority leader and minority whip. As Democratic Caucus Chair, Frost was often at odds with another prominent Dallas-area Congressman, Dick Armey, who was the Republican House Majority Leader.

Due to term limits as Democratic Caucus Chair, Frost made a bid for Minority Leader after Dick Gephardt resigned in the wake of losing four seats in the 2002 Congressional midterm elections, but Frost dropped out of the race and supported eventual winner Nancy Pelosi.

Frost was the ranking member of the House Rules Committee during his last term in the House.

Due to his strong fundraising ability for fellow Democrats, and the fact that he led the 1991 redistricting in Texas, he was one of the targets of a controversial mid-decade redistricting engineered by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. His district, which included portions of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington, was redrawn to be much more Republican. Its portions of Fort Worth and Arlington were replaced with wealthier and more Republican territory around Dallas. While Al Gore won the old 24th fairly handily in 2000, the new 24th would have given George W. Bush a staggering 68 percent of the vote in that election. Moreover, Frost&#x27;s home in Arlington was shifted into the heavily Republican 6th District, represented by 10-term incumbent Joe Barton. Frost decided to seek re-election in the newly redrawn 32nd District, which included a considerable amount of territory that he had represented from 1979 until 1993. He lost by 10 points to Republican Pete Sessions. Since Ralph Hall&#x27;s party switch earlier in 2004, Frost had been the only white Democrat to represent a significant portion of the Metroplex.

==Retirement==
In 2005, Frost was a candidate for chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He dropped out of the race on February 1. On February 15, Frost was hired by Fox News as a political commentator.

Frost is now an attorney at the Polsinelli law firm and president of America Votes. He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

In a July 2011 op-ed regarding the debt ceiling crisis, Frost wrote, &quot;We now have a group of U.S. politicians seeking political purity, who seem to have much in common with the Taliban. They are tea party members.&quot;

Frost co-authored with Tom Davis, Richard E. Cohen, and David Eisenhower the 2014 book &quot;The Partisan Divide&quot; in which they attempt to explain the reasons behind an increasingly polarized U.S. Congress and offer possible solutions.

After leaving office, he became involved in political reform efforts, including joining nine other former members of Congress to co-author a 2021 opinion editorial advocating reforms of Congress.

==Personal==

In 1976, Frost married Valerie H. Hall in Dallas. They divorced in 1998. Later that year he married Kathryn Frost, a major general in the United States Army. She died in 2006, and in 2008, Frost married Jo Ellen Ronson.

<text>Alexander Duff (25 April 1806 – 12 February 1878), was a Scottish missionary in India; where he played a large part in the development of higher education. He was a Moderator of the General Assembly and convener of the foreign missions committee of the Free Church of Scotland and a scientific liberal reformer of anglicized evangelism across the Empire. He was the first overseas missionary of the Church of Scotland to India. On 13 July 1830 he founded the General Assembly&#x27;s Institution in Calcutta, now known as the Scottish Church College. He also played a part in establishing the University of Calcutta. He was twice Moderator of the Free Church of Scotland in 1851 and 1873, the only person to serve the role twice.

==Early life==
Alexander Duff was born in Auchnahyle, Scotland, and raised parish of Moulin, Perthshire and was brought up at Balnakeilly. His parents were James Duff, gardener and farmer at Auchnahagh, and Jean Rattray. Alexander had 5 siblings. Margaret, William, Findlay, John and Jean. After receiving his initial schooling at the Moulin and Kirkmichael Schools, and Perth Academy (where he was dux), he studied arts and theology at the University of St. Andrews. He was greatly influenced by the teaching, missionary fervour, and personality of Thomas Chalmers, then Professor of Moral Philosophy. He graduated with an M.A. (Hons) in 1824. Subsequently he was licensed to preach by Presbytery of St Andrews in April 1829. Duff was ordained by the Presbytery of Edinburgh on 12 August following as first (official) missionary of the Church of Scotland to India. Travelling to there, he left Edinburgh on 19 September and sailed 14 October 1829.

==Mission in India==

After an adventurous voyage during which he was twice shipwrecked, Duff arrived in Calcutta on 27 May 1830. After inspecting the Bengali schools, he concluded that students were not receiving an adequate education in a broad range of subjects and secondly, that he would instruct his students using English instead of the local dialects. He at once identified himself with a policy which had far-reaching effects. Christian missions in India had been successful only in converting a few low-caste groups from a poor socio-economic background. The upper caste Hindu and Muslim communities had been practically untouched. Duff shrewdly assessed that these affluent communities could not be accessed by traditional evangelical methods. He recognised that holding out the prospect of upward mobility, by offering a western education, would bring the children of the affluent classes into his range of influence, which could then be extended to encompass religion. Duff devised the policy by using a western system of education to slowly convert Hindus and Muslims to Christianity. The success of his work had the effect:
#of altering the policy of the government of India in matters of education;
#of securing the recognition of education as a missionary agency by Christian churches at home; and,
#of securing entrance for Christian ideas into the minds of high-caste Hindus.

By teaching biblical courses as well as courses in the physical sciences, Duff hoped that students would logically come to realise the contradictions and impracticality of Hinduism and embrace wholeheartedly the truth of Christianity. Even as his educational and academic work is prospered, the remarkable conversions were no longer so obvious. While a few students converted, Duff seems to have widely miscalculated the resilience of Hinduism as well as its ability to adapt itself to western knowledge. Whereas Duff and many of his fellow evangelists saw Christianity and Hinduism as diametrically opposed, Hindus did not generally consider the knowledge either tradition provided as mutually exclusive with the other.

==Education in English==
Duff opened a school in which all kinds of secular subjects were taught, from the rudiments upwards to a university standard, alongside the Bible. The English language was used as the medium of instruction on the grounds that it was the key to Western knowledge. Alexander Duff proposed a theory which he called the &quot;downward filter theory&quot; in which he believed that by catering to the middle and upper social classes, the knowledge of Christianity would eventually filter down the social ladder. Although he promoted the teaching of English in schools, he still viewed the vernacular as an important language for spreading Christianity among &quot;the masses&quot; but deemed it inferior to the English language because it was not progressive. Duff wrote a pamphlet on the question, entitled &quot;A New Era of the English Language and Literature in India&quot;. A government minute was adopted on 7 March 1835, to the effect that in higher education, the object of the British government in India should be the promotion of European science and literature among the natives of India, and that all funds appropriated for purposes of education would be best employed on English education alone. His views influenced Peter Percival, a pioneering educator, linguist and missionary who worked in Sri Lankan Tamil dominant Jaffna peninsula in Sri Lanka.

Within the British Indian community of that era, there were not lacking those &quot;Orientalists&quot; who saw value in the traditional learning of India and wished to support and encourage it. They opposed Duff&#x27;s policy of stringently disregarding the same while assiduously promoting the spread of western education, culture and religion. In 1839, Lord Auckland, the governor-general of India, yielded to them and adopted a policy which was a compromise between the two perspectives.

Regardless, English became the tool through which Indians were able to understand and advance themselves through the British institutions of government. This opportunity to share in governance established one of the foundations on which eventual self-rule was built.

==The Institutes==
Shortly after landing in India in 1830, Duff opened his institution in a house located at upper Chitpur Road in the Jorasanko neighbourhood of Calcutta. The house was made available to him by &quot;Feringhi Kamal Bose&quot;, an affluent Hindu. The school soon began to expand into a missionary college, known as the General Assembly&#x27;s Institution. The location was a source of controversy for the Missions Committee who wanted to remain at the heart of Bengali society in the city of Calcutta. In 1834, Duff returned to Britain broken in health. During this sojourn, he succeeded in securing the approval of his church for his educational plans, and in arousing much interest in the work of foreign missions. His struggles were described in a speech at Exeter Hall on 8 May 1837 that called for hundreds of thousands of new teachers for India.

In 1836, the Calcutta institution was moved to Gorachand Bysack&#x27;s house in the Garanhata neighbourhood. On 23 February 1837, Mr. MacFarlon, the Chief Magistrate of Calcutta, laid the foundation stone for a new building belonging to the mission itself. The building was designed by John Gray construction was superintended by Capt. John Thomson, both of the East India Company. The construction of the building was completed in 1839.

Duff returned to India in 1840, by which time The Institution had expanded to 600 Indian pupils from five to nine years old. At the Disruption of 1843, Duff sided with the Free Church. He gave up the college buildings, with all their effects, and with unabated courage set to work to provide a new institution, which came to be known as the Free Church Institution. In 1857, when the University of Calcutta was established, the Free Church Institution was one of its earliest affiliates, and Duff would also serve in the university&#x27;s first senate.

These two institutions founded by Duff, i.e., the General Assembly&#x27;s Institution and the Free Church Institution would be merged in 1908 to form the Scottish Churches&#x27; College. After the unification of the Church of Scotland in 1929, the institution would be known as Scottish Church College. He had the support of Sir James Outram and Sir Henry Lawrence, and the encouragement of seeing a new band of converts, including several young men born of high caste. In 1844, governor-general Viscount Hardinge opened government appointments to all who had studied in institutions similar to Duff&#x27;s institution. In the same year, Duff co-founded the &quot;Calcutta Review&quot;, of which he served as editor from 1845 to 1849.

Several important Indian figures were products of Duff&#x27;s Institutions. Most notably, Rev. Lal Behari Dey, who wrote two books (&quot;Folk Tales of Bengal&quot; and &quot;Bengal Peasant Life&quot;) that were widely distributed among Indian schools, and Krishna Mohan Banerjee, who became registrar of Calcutta University .

==Later years==

In 1849, Duff returned to Scotland.

He was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1851, in succession to Nathaniel Paterson.

He gave evidence before various Indian committees of parliament on matters of education. This led to an important despatch by Viscount Halifax, president of the Board of Control, to governor-general the Marquess of Dalhousie, authorising an educational advance in primary and secondary schools; the provision of technical and scientific teaching; and the establishment of schools for girls. In 1854, Duff visited the United States, where what is now New York University gave him the degree of L.L.D.; he was already D.D. of the University of Aberdeen.

In 1856, Duff returned to India, where the mutiny broke out the following year; his descriptive letters written during this period were collected in a volume entitled &quot;The Indian Mutiny - its Causes and Results (1858).&quot; During this stint in India, Duff gave much thought and time to the University of Calcutta, which owes its examination system and the prominence given to physical sciences to his influence. In 1863, Sir Charles Trevelyan offered him the post of vice-chancellor of the university, but his health compelled him to leave India. As a memorial of his work, the Duff Hall was erected in the centre of the educational buildings of Calcutta.

In 1864, Duff visited South Africa, and on his return, became convener of the foreign missions committee of the Free Church. In 1870 he was the principal force in founding the Anglo-Indian Christian Union (an alliance of Protestant churches to minister to scattered British communities in India), of which he became the first President, and sent Rev. John Fordyce to India as the Union&#x27;s Commissioner there. He raised money to endow a missionary chair in Evangelistic Theology at New College, Edinburgh, and himself became first professor. Among other missionary labours of his later years, he helped the Free Church mission on Lake Nyassa, travelled to Syria to inspect a mission at Lebanon, and assisted Lady Aberdeen and Lord Polwarth to establish the Gordon Memorial Mission in Natal. In 1873, the Free Church was threatened with a schism owing to negotiations for union with the United Presbyterian Church. Duff was called to the chair, and guided the church through this crisis. He also took part in forming the alliance of Reformed Churches holding the Presbyterian system.

Alexander Duff died in Sidmouth, Devon on 12 February 1878. He is buried with his wife, Ann Scott Drysdale, in the north-east section of the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh.

By his will, he devoted his personal property to found a lectureship on foreign missions at New College (now part of the University of Edinburgh) on the model of the Bampton Lectures.

==Friendships and other achievements==

By the age of thirty he was already a remarkable preacher. Joining the Church Missionary Society in 1836 he and his friend Rev Dr James Lewis were shapers of the new Church of Scotland Mission. Of his many Scottish friends, Dr Robert Hall was a leading academic, a powerful orator, with a large retentive memory whose impulsive liberalism formed his early beliefs. They helped him publish a pamphlet &quot;English Education in India&quot; which formed part of his address to the General Assembly of the Kirk in Edinburgh in 1837, which he dedicated to the students of the four ancient universities. A passionate advocate of reform he banished corporal punishments for girls, striving to Christianise education through humane methods of teaching. In seeking out William Hopkins Pearce for a new Baptist mission, he emphasised the inter-denominational character of united prayer events. He was unassuming, modest, pious, and quite uninterested in the politics of popery and anti-papism. Yet only the Episcopalians remained beyond his reach with their broad brush &quot;Quarterly&quot; publications. Despite the perceived handicap he could influence serious political figures in the Indian civil Service through the media of &quot;Calcutta Review.&quot; In one article he made an advancement in liberal theology exposing the cruelty of &quot;Female Infanticide in Central and Western India&quot; (1844). And in the same year his power in the Free Church was rehearsed in a lecture to The Free Churchmen of Calcutta in the Masonic Hall. Its title &quot;The Sole and Supreme Headship of the Lord Jesus Christ over His Own Church, or a voice from the Ganges relative to the courses which led to the recent disruption...&quot; symbolised his conviction in the supremacy of Christianity to bring enlightened education to Indians. Two Bengali intellectuals travelled to Edinburgh to be baptised at Duff&#x27;s request. Mahendra Lal Bazak and Khailai Chandra Mukherjya were closely watched by Dr Thomas Chalmers, a renowned writer and church leader. Dr. Chalmers&#x27; death in 1847 was a real blow to the Free Church; and to Duff, his pupil and then successor as professor. It forced Duff to deny his Scottishness to maintain a life dedicated to working in India. He refused the principalship in 1874. Duff knew him well in the cultural capital of Scotland pursuing moral, material and spiritual development while steering his charges away from the temptations of Heathenism. During 1845–46 he conducted numerous Indian conversions with typical missionary zeal. Exhibiting a strong sense of Scottish character he personified individual freedoms, baptising Jewish refugees, overcoming prejudice, and persisting in the face of prohibitive rules among the Hindu caste system. A tireless campaigner, and restless traveller from Calcutta to Ceylon, he visited thousands of missionaries and their stations. A profound sense of duty was monitored by legal correctness of his own opinions, that never ceased to improve. Deeply rooted in the doctrine of justification by faith alone, he mixed doctrinal worship with regular business committees to raise money for the church. Eloquent, he recalled the poems of Ossian as closely as he expounded the values of liberal Zionism, richly endowed by a Jacobite tradition that informed a fierce feeling of injustice. On being appointed Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1851 he was asked by Lord Granville to testify to the House of Lords, in which he hoped to influence the Wood&#x27;s Educational Despatch of 1854. Disappointed by the slow progress of change, he embarked on a trip to America. At Washington DC Dr Duff addressed the Congress. In Toronto he gave a sermon to Kroom&#x27;s Church. On his last day he preached at the Broadway Tabernacle, where he received benediction. Hugely popular, he was bade farewell by weeping crowds from the Hudson River wharves on 13 May 1854. Back in England he was met by Lord Haddo, son of Prime Minister, Lord Aberdeen. After sipping the Malvern Spa waters for a cure, he decided on a Grand Tour of Europe and the Holy Land with his friend Dr James Lumsden. At his death he was acclaimed by Scot William Ewart Gladstone as an heroic, apostolic saint. A memorial Celtic cross was erected at Pitlochry parish church to celebrate a life of deep Christian service.

==Legacy and influence==

Alexander Duff was incredibly influential in Indian education and government and set several precedents. Almost as soon as he arrived his evangelising changed Indian education: in 1832 another Scot, John Wilson (Scottish missionary) established a school in Bombay. Duff&#x27;s methods were widely imitated and his cumulative twenty-five years in the subcontinent were largely characterised by the establishment of western-style educational institutions warmly received by Ram Mohan Roy. Duff can be credited with creating a framework that influenced educational policy and practice during the nineteenth century and beyond. Since his schools catered mostly to the Hindu middle class, he was able to receive attention from the government which helped to spread his methods and ideas. Several other English schools were established because the General Assemblies Institution was so successful. The success and influence of Duff&#x27;s college led to the founding of the Calcutta Medical College. Hindu scriptures forbid people of higher castes from touching dead bodies, which prevented medical students from performing cadaver dissections. Students from Duff&#x27;s college expressed that their liberal, English education had &quot;freed their minds from prejudice and the dissection of the human body was not objectionable to them.&quot; This new idea allowed higher caste Indians to pursue medical professions, therefore advancing healthcare in India.

The top-down theory of education described above typifies Duff&#x27;s evangelical elitism, one of the main elements of his legacy in the subcontinent. Duff seems to have believed that there was a direct relationship between education and missionary work. Not only was the education of the Indian people critical to his goal of dispelling &quot;Hindu ignorance&quot; but it was in fact the duty of evangelicals to modernise and instruct Indian society using Western ideals and texts. While Duff was a highly skilled scholar who was devoted to India, his evangelistic ideals and western prejudice may have influenced his students in ways that he did not anticipate. Instead of initiating a mass conversion to Christianity he may have instead provided another catalyst for Hindu reform movements.

Duff hoped that through a western education in a time of enlightenment, Indians would be able to see the flaws in their religion and be compelled to convert to Christianity, but he did not consider the resilience of the Hindu religion and his efforts proved to be fairly unsuccessful on the broader scale. Educations of the Christian bible was accepted by Hindus because they were confident in their own religion and were not worried that their children would lose their faith. Hinduism was not only a religion but a culture, and the occupation of the British and their ideas was not drastic enough to change this. Because Alexander Duff was regarded well, his character served as a model to his students and friends and his teaching did eventually lead to some reformist movements within Hinduism. In fact, Duff&#x27;s work led to the acceptance of more Indians into public official positions in government. This experience was critical to the transitional Indian government after Independence in 1947. A Church was established in 1848 and named as Duff Church in 1910 in memory of Alexander Duff. Another church, in Kirkmichael, Perth and Kinross, Scotland, is named Duff Memorial Church in his honour. Duff attended primary school in the village.

<text>Roger D. Moore (November 16, 1939 – March 21, 2019) was the 1973 recipient (with Larry Breed and Richard Lathwell) of the Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was given &quot;for their work in the design and implementation of APL\360, setting new standards in simplicity, efficiency, reliability and response time for interactive systems.&quot;

Moore was a cofounder of I. P. Sharp Associates and held a senior position in the company for many years. Before this, he contributed to the SUBALGOL compiler at Stanford University and wrote the ALGOL 60 compiler for the Ferranti-Packard 6000 and the ICT 1900. Along with his work on the programming language APL, he was also instrumental in the development of IPSANET, a private packet switching data network.

==At Stanford University==
Roger D. Moore was born in Redlands, California. Before graduation, he worked as an operator of the Burroughs 220 computer at Stanford. During this time he provided some support for Larry Breed’s card stunt system. He also spent time studying the Burroughs 220 BALGOL compiler. This resulted in BUTTERFLY which was described by George Forsythe:
Each grader program was written as a BALGOL-language procedure. It was then compiled together with a procedure called BUTTERFLY, written by Moore. The result was a relocatable machine-language procedure, with a mechanism for equating its variables to variables of any BALGOL program, in just the form of the BALGOL compiler’s own machine-language library procedures (SIN, WRITE, READ, etc.).

Forsythe anticipated a problem as described by Bob Braden:BALGOL at Stanford outlived the B220 hardware. In 1962 Stanford contracted with IBM to obtain an IBM 7090 for campus computing. This created great consternation in Forsythe’s office. A significant body of faculty and students was now familiar with BALGOL, and the high compiling speed of the BAC was vital in an academic environment. To subject this community to the production-oriented system software offered by IBM, including a slow Fortran compiler and cumbersome operating system, would have moved academic computing at Stanford backward by several years. To address this problem, in December 1961, Moore was hired by Forsythe to work on the SUBALGOL compiler for the IBM 7090. Braden and Breed were hired soon afterward.

After completion of SUBALGOL, he was hired by Ferranti-Packard to write an ALGOL 60 compiler for the FP6000. This compiler was part of the software package which are included in the sale of the FP6000 to International Computers and Tabulators.

==At I. P. Sharp Associates==
In December 1964 most employees of Ferranti-Packard&#x27;s computer group were laid off. Along with six other former FP employees he formed I. P. Sharp Associates. He was vice-president from incorporation to his retirement in 1989.

In 1966 he, Larry Breed and Richard Lathwell began work on the APL\360 interpreter.

Lastly, APL\360 owes much of its superior time-sharing performance to Roger D. Moore, of I.P. Sharp Associates, Toronto, who was principally responsible for the supervisor. Its design has not been described to the extent it deserves. This team received the Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was given: &quot;For their work in the design and implementation of APL\360, setting new standards in simplicity, efficiency, reliability and response time for interactive systems.&quot;

In 1970, Moore became project leader of IPSA&#x27;s speculative DOS/360 COBOL compiler project. Although the compiler had satisfactory performance, the market did not accept it.

IPSA offered APL time-sharing service starting in 1969. By 1975, the inflexibility and communication error intolerance of time-division multiplexing were no longer tolerable. He became the chief architect of the IPSANET packet switching computer network. In 1976 this system was deployed in North America and London.

In 1984, IPSA released Sharp APL for the IBM PC. This package included a 370 emulator written by Moore.

==Retirement==
After retiring from IPSA in early 1989, he became interested in opera and chamber music. Along with attending many performances, he has supported concerts, commissions and advanced music education. He died in Toronto on March 21, 2019.

== Compositions funded ==
Moore has funded the composing of many works.

<text>Some countries can be considered to have multiple [[capital city|capitals]]. In some cases, one city is the capital for some purposes, and one or more others are capital for other purposes, without any being considered an official capital in preference to the others. There are also cases where there is a single legally defined capital, but one or more other cities operate as the seat of government of some or all parts of the national government; in these situations, sources may disagree on whether these other cities are considered additional capital cities.

==More than one capital at present==

==More than one capital in the past==
These countries have had two cities that served as administrative capitals at the same time, for various reasons such as war, weather or partition. In some cases, the second capital is considered a temporary capital.

<doc id="850230" wikidata="Q7326586" url="?curid=850230" title="Richard Huggett">
<text>Richard John Huggett (born January 1944) is a British former teacher who has been a candidate in a number of elections, using descriptions which were similar to those of established political parties, leading to this practice being outlawed under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998.

==Background==
Huggett studied psychology and zoology at the University of London and obtained a diploma in social and administrative studies. He lived for about 10 years in the South of France where he built yachts. Huggett was reported to have been an intelligence officer, who from 1989 ran a school in Hampshire, which closed down when the lease on its premises expired.

==1994 European Parliament election==
At the European Parliament Election, 1994, Huggett was nominated under the label &quot;Literal Democrat&quot; for the Devon and East Plymouth seat. He ran his campaign from Canonteign Manor, the home he shared with his mother near Christow in the Teign valley in Devon. In an interview recorded during the campaign but due to be broadcast after it Huggett hinted that future government should be conducted through electronic referendums and said &quot;the traditional party system generates all sorts of undemocratic processes.&quot;

When the nominations closed and it was revealed that Huggett was a candidate with the description &quot;Literal Democrat&quot;, the Liberal Democrats launched legal action in the High Court of Justice alleging that the Returning Officer had wrongly accepted a nomination which was designed to confuse voters. The Judge ruled that the nomination had to stand. In the result, Huggett won over 10,000 votes, far more than the 700 vote majority of the Conservative candidate over the Liberal Democrat.

==Winchester constituency==
Huggett also attempted to run as &quot;Gerald Maclone&quot; in the Winchester constituency in the 1997 general election and the following by-election (the sitting MP was junior minister Gerry Malone). He stood under his own name as &quot;Liberal Democrat Top Choice for Parliament&quot; in the general election, winning 640 votes in a contest that was decided by just 2 votes. The result was annulled in court, and Huggett stood as &quot;Literal Democrat Mark Here to Win&quot; in the ensuing by-election.

<text>The Volvo P1/Mazda BK/Ford Global C-car Platform is Ford&#x27;s global compact car automobile platform. It replaces the Ford C170 platform and Mazda B platform (BJ). The C1 platform debuted with the European Ford Focus C-Max compact MPV in early 2004. The platform is designed for either front- or all-wheel drive.

First called the C1 platform, it was designed in Ford&#x27;s European development center in Cologne, Germany, as the &quot;C Technologies Program&quot;. It was said to be one of the largest platform programs in history at that time. The Ford Focus, Volvo S40 and V50, and Mazda3 (BK and BL) share about 60% of their parts and components. Thirty engineers each from Ford, Mazda, and Volvo worked in Cologne for two years to combine the compact-car engineering for all three automakers under the direction of Ford Director of C Technologies Derrick Kuzak, Ford of Europe vice president of product development.

The platform has been stretched creating the EUCD for use in future Volvo vehicles.

Among all of the cars, the floorpan is different, but the front and rear subframes, suspension, steering, braking, safety, and some electrical components are shared.

Vehicles using this first iteration of the platform include:
* 2003–2008 Mazda3/Axela (BK) (Note: production continued in China through 2013)
* 2003–2010 Ford Focus C-Max (first generation) (C214), first European vehicle on this platform
* 2004–2010 Ford Focus (second generation, Europe) (C307), (Note: the Ford Focus (North America) continued on the C170 platform through 2011)
* 2004–2012 Volvo S40 II (P11)
* 2004–2012 Volvo V50 (P12)
* 2005–2010 Mazda Premacy/Mazda 5 (CR) (and related Ford i-Max)
* 2006–2013 Volvo C70 II (P15)
* 2007–2013 Volvo C30 (P14)
* 2008–2012 Ford Kuga (C394)
* 2008–2013 Mazda Biante
* 2006-2012 Mazda CX-7

==Second generation==
The C1 platform has been replaced by the global C platform (or C-car) and combines three previous platforms as part of Ford&#x27;s &quot;One Ford&quot; efficiency drive.

Ford global C platform vehicles:
* 2011–2019 Ford C-Max (second generation) (C344) and Grand C-Max
* 2012–2018 Ford Focus (C346)
* 2013–2019 Ford Escape / Ford Kuga (C520)
* 2015–2019 Lincoln MKC
* 2013–2023 Ford Transit Connect
* 2015–2023 Ford Escort (China)

Vehicles partially based on global C platform:
* 2009–2013 Mazda Axela/Mazda3 (J68/BL)
* 2010–2018 Mazda Premacy/Mazda5 (CW)
* 2013–2019 Volvo V40 II/V40 Cross Country (Y555/Y556)

<doc id="850237" wikidata="Q5336614" url="?curid=850237" title="1999 Eddisbury by-election">
<text>The 1999 Eddisbury by-election was a parliamentary by-election held on 22 July 1999 for the British House of Commons constituency of [[Eddisbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Eddisbury]] in Cheshire.

On 25 May 1999 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced the appointment of Eddisbury&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP), the Rt. Hon. Sir Alastair Goodlad, as High Commissioner to the Commonwealth of Australia. This created a vacancy in the seat which Sir Alastair had retained as the Conservative candidate in the 1997 general election. Goodlad resigned from the House of Commons by accepting the office of Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern on 28 June 1999 to formally vacate his seat.

The 1999 British cabinet reshuffle was delayed by a week following Labour&#x27;s unexpected success in the by-election.

== Candidates ==
The Conservatives selected Stephen O&#x27;Brien, a former SDP member who lived in Chichester, to defend the seat. Labour nominated Margaret Hanson, wife of David Hanson (Labour MP for Delyn), who had also fought the seat at the 1997 election. Labour had been only just over 1,000 votes behind the Conservatives in 1997 and ran an energetic campaign, raising the issue of fox hunting which she pledged to ban. Prime Minister Tony Blair went to the constituency to campaign for her, an unusual move as it is convention for incumbent Prime Ministers not to visit byelection campaigns.

Polling day was 22 July and the result was a virtual carbon copy of that in 1997; each party had fought to a standstill.
