<text>Murray Hayden Haszard (born 11 May 1954) is a New Zealand entrepreneur and businessman who founded the companies B32 Software and Binary Research and is the chairman of Ilion Technology.

==B32 Software==
In 1983 he was contracted to convert Kiwi Packaging&#x27;s corrugator scheduling package Kiwiplan from Data General Business Basic to Fortran 77 on a Data General MV computer. He found that Fortran had fast number-crunching but slow disk access, difficult debugging and inability to share files without using system calls, and Business Basic had slow arithmetic and limited memory space, but easy debugging and convenient handling of file sharing. After leaving Kiwi Packaging he attempted to create a language which shared the virtues of both.

B32 Business Basic took three years to write, but it was technically superior to Data General&#x27;s Business Basic. Haszard expected that the world would beat a path to his door, but potential customers were conservative about using a new product, and doubtful that it could be supported from New Zealand. With the help particularly of George Henne and Maxon, a Toronto-based software reseller, B32 established a customer base and developed a reputation for performance in the Data General world.

Selling and supporting B32 required frequent exhausting trips to North America and Europe. Haszard expanded his company with an extra support programmer, but B32 continued to grow and was ported to the Unix operating system. A sales and support branch of B32 Software opened in Blue Ash, Ohio in 1990, but the demands of running a business only increased. Haszard wasn&#x27;t having fun any more, and when his chief competition, Transoft offered to buy him out, he accepted. B32 sold for US$800,000 in February 1992.

==Binary Research==
Haszard&#x27;s next venture was Binary Research, a company composed initially of former B32 employees. Binary Research&#x27;s first product, a parallel file transfer utility, failed to reach break-even in the market, but led to the concept of a disk cloning program, Ghost.

Ghost was a huge success, coming just as Windows 95 created a demand for disk cloning. The huge growth of the Internet made software marketing and support around the world much simpler than before. A sales and support office in North America was set up, and a network of agents established around the world. Haszard brought in a business partner, Gray Treadwell, to help manage the business, and increased his programming staff manyfold. The stress of managing an international business became intolerable for Haszard, and he looked for a buyer for Ghost. Symantec purchased Ghost for US$27.5 million in July 1998. Most of the employees of Binary Research became employees of Symantec.

==After Ghost==
Haszard set up Skunkworks Software with his remaining employees, producing a program called &quot;Focus&quot; which he describes as &quot;PowerPoint on steroids&quot;. He also diversified from software into innovative aircraft propeller design. He was quoted in &quot;Unlimited&quot; magazine&#x27;s November 2000 issue as saying &quot;I miss the adrenaline rush I had with Ghost and B32. There was a real fight for survival. I miss that.&quot;

Haszard invested in the New Zealand technology company Ilion Technology, which sold highly purified lithium metal to battery manufacturers and was also developing its own advanced battery designs. Ilion Technology planned to list itself on the NASDAQ stockmarket in 2000, but was unable to do so due to the fall of the markets. Ilion was left with much higher expenditure than income, and no cash reserves. Haszard and other investors kept the company afloat while it was reorganised, and he stepped in when the previous chairman lost the confidence of shareholders. Despite further efforts to fund the company, Ilion Technology ceased operations in 2007.

Haszard is the founder and chairman of Sprite Software, which makes software for backing up mobile devices and smart phones. Some of the other developers from Binary Research also work there.

<doc id="847845" wikidata="Q1467309" url="?curid=847845" title="Mid-Western Highway">
<text>Mid-Western Highway, sometimes Mid Western Highway, is a state highway located in the central western and northern Riverina regions of New South Wales, Australia. The highway services rural communities and links the Great Western, Mitchell, Olympic, Newell, Cobb and Sturt highways. Mid-Western Highway forms part of the most direct route road link between Sydney and Adelaide, with its eastern terminus in and western terminus in . It is designated part of route A41 between Bathurst and , and route B64 between Cowra and Hay.

During 2014 the Roads &amp; Maritime Services in conjunction with the NSW Geographical Names Board commenced a consultation process to change the name of the highway to the Wiradjuri Highway, as the only state highway to lie fully within the Wiradjuri cultural area.

==Route==
Mid-Western Highway runs generally west–east, roughly aligned along the Lachlan River in New South Wales, then stretching across the Hay Plain, generally towards the south-western corner of New South Wales. The highway is a single carriageway along its entire length, and shares a concurrency with Newell Highway between Marsden and .

Mid-Western Highway commences at the intersection with the Great Western and Mitchell Highways in the city of Bathurst. Heading west by southwest, the highway carries the A41 shield and passes through , where the village is bypassed in 1975, and to Cowra where the highway crosses the Lachlan River, forms the northern terminus of Olympic Highway and provides access to Lachlan Valley Way. At Cowra the highway heads west, now designated route B64 to , with a link to Henry Lawson Way as the highway heads further west to its junction with Newell Highway at Marsden. From Mardsen to West Wyalong, Newell Highway is concurrently signed as routes A39 and B64. Mid-Western Highway recommences west of West Wyalong and continues further west through Weethalle, and then southwest to Rankins Springs and Goolgowi, before reaching its western terminus in Hay at the intersection with Cobb Highway.

Following the upgrade of Hume Highway to a dual carriageway along the vast majority of its length in New South Wales, and the declaration of Sturt Highway as a national highway – despite Mid-Western Highway being the most direct route between Sydney and Adelaide – the route via the Hume and Sturt Highways through Wagga Wagga offers motorists a quicker route, despite being approximately longer.

The only major river crossing is the Lachlan River at Cowra.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB, later Transport for NSW). Mid-Western Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 6) on 8 August 1928, from the interchange with Great Western Highway and North-Western Highway (today Mitchell Highway) in Bathurst, via Blayney, Cowra, Wyalong, Rankins Springs, Gunbar, Booligal, Oxley, Balranald, Euston, and Wentworth, to the border with South Australia beyond Lake Victoria; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 6 on 8 April 1929. The highway was rerouted between Gunbar and Balranald to pass through Hay on 24 September 1929.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in the previous year, proclaimed the portion of the highway between Hay via Euston and Wentworth to the South Australian border to be part of Sturt Highway on 8 August 1933; the highway&#x27;s western end was truncated at its own junction with Sturt Highway at Hay instead. This was further altered when State Highway 21 (later Cobb Highway) was altered to run through Hay on 12 January 1944; Mid-Western Highway was further truncated to the intersection with State Highway 21 in Hay as a result. Newell Highway was declared a National Highway in 1992, and was re-declared to form one continuous highway on 15 January 1993: as a consequence, Mid-Western Highway was re-declared to run from Hay to West Wyalong, and then from Marsden to Bathurst.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Mid-Western Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 6, from Hay via Goolgowi and Rankin Springs to the intersection with Newell Highway at West Wyalong, then from the intersection of Newell Highway at Marsden via Grenfell and Cowra to Bathurst.

Mid-Western Highway was signed National Route 24 across its entire length in 1955. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route A41 between Bathurst and Cowra, and route B64 between Cowra and Hay.

<text>Mark Millar (; born 24 December 1969) is a Scottish comic book writer who first came to prominence with a run on the superhero series &quot;The Authority&quot;, published by DC Comics&#x27; Wildstorm imprint. Millar has written extensively for Marvel Comics, including runs on &quot;The Ultimates&quot;, which has been called &quot;the comic book of the decade&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine and described as a major inspiration for the 2012 film &quot;The Avengers&quot; by its co-story creator Zak Penn, &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;Avengers&quot; for Marvel&#x27;s Ultimate imprint, as well as &quot;Marvel Knights Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Wolverine&quot;. In 2006, Millar wrote the &quot;Civil War&quot; mini-series that served as the centrepiece for the eponymous company-wide crossover storyline and later inspired the Marvel Studios film &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;. The &quot;&quot; storyline, published as part of Millar&#x27;s run on &quot;Wolverine&quot;, served as the inspiration for the 2017 film &quot;Logan&quot;.

Millar has written numerous creator-owned series which have been published under the unified Millarworld label, including &quot;Wanted&quot; with J. G. Jones, &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; with John Romita, Jr., &quot;Nemesis&quot; with Steve McNiven, &quot;Superior&quot; and &quot;Supercrooks&quot; with Leinil Francis Yu, &quot;The Secret Service&quot; with Dave Gibbons and &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot; with Frank Quitely. Some of these series have been adapted into live-action and animated series and feature films, such as &quot;Wanted&quot;, &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot; and &quot;Super Crooks&quot;. In 2017, Millarworld was purchased by Netflix with the aim for Millar to continue developing original properties that would later be adapted by the studio into various formats.

In addition to his work as a writer, Millar serves as an executive producer on all film and television adaptations of his comics. Between 2012 and 2016, he was employed by 20th Century Fox as a creative consultant for adaptations of Marvel properties.

In 2013, Millar was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to film and literature.

==Early life==
Millar was born on 24 December 1969 in Coatbridge, Scotland. He spent the first half of his life in the town&#x27;s Townhead area and attended St. Ambrose High School.

Millar has four older brothers, and one older sister, who are 22, 20, 18, 16 and 14 years older than him, respectively. He was first introduced to comic books at age 4 by his brother Bobby, who at the time was attending university and, as of 2010, worked at a special needs school. The first comics that Millar read were the seminal &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #121, which featured the death of Gwen Stacy, and a Superman book purchased by Bobby that day. Millar&#x27;s interest in the medium was further cemented with the black-and-white reprints of other comics that his brothers purchased for him, which he enjoyed so much that he drew a spider web across his face with an indelible marker that his parents were unable to scrub off in time for his First Communion photo a week later.

In the mid-late 1970s, Millar frequently appeared as a guest on the long-running Scottish kids TV programme &quot;Glen Michael&#x27;s Cartoon Cavalcade&quot;, which he was a regular fan of at the time. On one occasion, he was invited onto the show to talk about the history of comics and, in a 2010 interview with the Scottish newspaper &quot;Daily Record&quot;, Millar has stated that Glen Michael&#x27;s TV programme was where he first discovered superheroes.

Millar&#x27;s mother died of a heart attack at age 64, when Millar was 14, and his father died four years later, aged 65. Although Millar enjoyed drawing comics, he was not permitted to go to art school because his family frowned upon such endeavours as a waste of time for the academic Millar, who studied subjects like chemistry, physics and advanced maths. He initially planned to be a doctor, and subsequently decided that becoming an economist would be a viable alternate plan, but later decided that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t quite hack it&quot; in that occupation. He attended Glasgow University to study politics and economics, but dropped out after his father&#x27;s death left him without the money to pay his living expenses.

==Career==
===1980s–1990s work===
Millar was first inspired to become a comic book creator after meeting Alan Moore at a con in the mid-1980s. Years later, when an 18-year-old Millar interviewed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrison for a fanzine, he told Morrison that he wanted to create comics as both a writer and an artist. Morrison, who then-recently returned to comics after spending most of the decade touring with his band The Mixers and had limited experience with both writing and drawing stories earlier in his career, suggested that Millar focus on one of those career paths, as it was very hard to be successful at both, which Millar cites as the best advice he has ever received. Soon after, Millar sold his first script, &quot;Saviour&quot;, to an independent Leicester-based publisher Trident. Illustrated by Daniel Vallely, Morrison&#x27;s former bandmate in The Mixers and, earlier, The Fauves, &quot;Saviour&quot; provided a mix of religious themes, satire and superhero action that quickly brought Millar to the attention of the wider British comics industry and resulted in several script commissions for the long-running anthology &quot;2000 AD&quot; and its sister title &quot;Crisis&quot;.

In 1992, Trident&#x27;s owner Neptune Distribution went bankrupt, leaving both &quot;Saviour&quot; and &quot;The Shadowmen&quot;, Millar&#x27;s second series at the publisher, unfinished. By that time, Millar already became a semi-regular contributor to &quot;2000AD&quot; and its adjacent titles, and his output included several &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot; serials, a six-part prison story &quot;Insiders&quot; for &quot;Crisis&quot;, a &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; spin-off series &quot;Red Razors&quot;, as well as numerous newspaper strips starring Dredd himself for &quot;Daily Star&quot;. The following year, Millar, Morrison and writer John Smith were given editorial reins over &quot;2000AD&quot; for an eight-week run titled &quot;The Summer Offensive&quot;. The controversial initiative resulted, among other things, in the first major story co-written by Millar and Morrison, &quot;Big Dave&quot;.

In 1994, Millar crossed over to the American comic book industry, taking over the long-running series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, published under DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint. The first four issues of his run were again co-written with Morrison, who, according to Millar, &quot;came on board &lt;...&gt; to make sure that DC selected me above anyone else pitching for the gig&quot;. Although Millar&#x27;s further work on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; brought some critical acclaim to the ailing title, the book&#x27;s sales were still low enough to warrant cancellation by the publisher. For the next few years, Millar continued to write sporadically for &quot;2000AD&quot; and various American publishers, often co-scripting the stories with Morrison, with whom he shares the writing credit on the mini-series &quot;Skrull Kill Krew&quot; for Marvel, a short run on &quot;Vampirella&quot; for Harris, a year-long run on &quot;The Flash&quot; as well as &quot;Aztek: The Ultimate Man&quot; for DC.

Several of Millar&#x27;s unrealized projects of this period include a revamp of Marvel&#x27;s 2099 imprint and an &quot;end-of-the-world&quot; storyline for &quot;Marvel Tales&quot;, both co-created with Grant Morrison. In late 1998, Millar and Morrison, along with Mark Waid and Tom Peyer, developed an extensive proposal for the Superman titles that was scheduled to launch in January 2000. The proposal was greenlit, and the team&#x27;s tenure as collaborative writers was scheduled to begin with upcoming editor Eddie Berganza&#x27;s first issue. Upon returining from his vacation, then-current DC editor Mike Carlin was shocked to discover that big changes were being implemented to Superman without his knowledge and vetoed the project. In 1999, Millar also developed pitches for Phantom Stranger and Secret Society of Super-Villains as well as a revamp of his debut series &quot;Saviour&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Millar made the first attempt to branch out from comics into screenwriting with a vampire-themed black comedy-drama &quot;Sikeside&quot;. The script was eventually picked up by Channel 4 with Millar as both writer and director, and, although it was initially written as a TV movie, the production company asked Millar to develop it into a six-episode series instead. Described as &quot;&quot;Buffy&quot; meets &quot;Trainspotting&quot;&quot; and planned to be filmed in Millar&#x27;s hometown of Coatbridge, &quot;Sikeside&quot; was ultimately cancelled during pre-production. In a 2010 interview, Millar mentioned that he has sold the rights to the script to producer Angus Lamont who wanted to turn it into a film for a theatrical release.

In 1999 and 2000, Millar wrote a newspaper column for &quot;The Evening Times&quot;.

===Marvel and DC career===

Millar started gaining notice at DC Comics for his work on the all-ages comic book series &quot;Superman Adventures&quot;, which featured stories set in the continuity of &quot;&quot;. Millar, a self-proclaimed Superman fan, stayed on the title for two years and received two Eisner Award nominations while penning one-off stories featuring the version of the character from the mainline DC Universe. Millar&#x27;s best known Superman story, the three-issue Elseworlds mini-series &quot;&quot;, was first announced in 1998, even though Millar finished most of the script two-year prior. As the series&#x27; original artist Dave Johnson fell behind the schedule, Millar opposed the idea of using other artists for the remaining pages. DC eventually brought in artist Kilian Plunkett to complete the book in 2002. &quot;Red Son&quot;, which Millar first came up with as a child after reading &quot;Superman&quot; #300, was published the following year and later adapted into an .

In August 1999, it was announced that Millar and Scottish artist Frank Quitely will be taking over &quot;The Authority&quot;, an ongoing series published by DC Comics&#x27; Wildstorm imprint, on the recommendation of the outgoing writer and series&#x27; co-creator Warren Ellis. Millar&#x27;s trademark style of over-the-top violence mixed with satire, pop culture references and mature themes was met with critical and commercial success while the book itself suffered from censorship enacted by DC starting with the new creative team&#x27;s very first issue and continuing into Millar-written spin-off mini-series focusing on the team&#x27;s former leader Jenny Sparks. As a result, the creators repeatedly requested a &quot;Suggested for Mature Readers&quot; label for the series but the idea was vetoed by then-Publisher of DC Comics Paul Levitz. Meanwhile, DC published a &quot;lost&quot; &quot;Superman Adventures&quot; script by Millar to capitalize on his newfound success, while Millar himself considered a move from his native Scotland to the United States, deliberating between staff position offers made by Wildstorm and DC Comics&#x27; main competitor Marvel.

In June 2000, Marvel announced that Millar will join its then-upcoming &quot;Ultimate&quot; line of comics as the writer on &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, since Brian Michael Bendis, who was previously attached to the series, decided to focus his attention on the inaugural &quot;Ultimate&quot; launch of the Spider-Man title. The line, designed to simplify and streamline the company&#x27;s long-running fictional continuity for mainstream audiences, was met with instant critical and commercial success and, soon after the launch of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, Millar announced that he had signed a two-year contract for a staff writing position at Marvel. As part of the deal, Millar and his family relocated to New York City.

In November 2000, Millar and Quitely announced their plans to leave &quot;The Authority&quot; after the third story arc, which was supposed to run in issues #22–25 (cover-dated March–June 2001) if the series was to maintain a monthly schedule. However, soon after the first issue of the arc was published, it was announced that Quitely had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel and would therefore leave the title earlier than planned. Wildstorm assigned Art Adams to finish the last issues and hired writer Tom Peyer and artist Dustin Nguyen to create another four-issue story arc that would fill the publishing gap while Adams worked on his portion of the series. Then, following the 11 September 2001 attacks, Wildstorm decided to postpone the release of the remaining three issues and further edit the completed but not yet released work for sensitive content, which eventually drove Adams away from the title. &quot;The Authority&quot; #29, Millar&#x27;s last issue on the series, was published with art by Gary Erskine and the cover date of July 2002. Another Millar-written &quot;The Authority&quot; spin-off, a one-shot story tentatively titled &quot;Apollo/Midnighter&quot;, was announced for a 2000 release but never produced.

In 2002, Millar and artist Bryan Hitch further expanded Marvel&#x27;s Ultimate line with &quot;The Ultimates&quot;, a reimagining of the company&#x27;s Avengers team. The title also proved highly successful, although it suffered from delays in shipping due to Hitch&#x27;s personal issues. &quot;The Ultimates&quot; was eventually cancelled after 13 issues and two years of publication with the aim of relaunching the title so that more issues could be produced in advance. &quot;The Ultimates 2&quot; launched shortly thereafter and also suffered from delays, this time due to Millar&#x27;s newly-diagnosed chronic condition and increased workload at Marvel. The second volume as well as the creative team&#x27;s run on the title ended in 2007 with another 13th issue. Millar and Hitch&#x27;s work on &quot;The Ultimates&quot; inspired two Marvel Animated Features titled &quot;Ultimate Avengers&quot; and the subsequent 2012 Marvel Studios feature film &quot;The Avengers&quot;, directed by Joss Whedon. Actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who portrayed the character Quicksilver in the 2015 sequel film &quot;&quot;, stated that it also drew inspiration from the Ultimate comics.

In 2002 and 2003, Millar wrote a column for Comic Book Resources. Around the same time, Millar&#x27;s website included a teaser for a 6-issue Punisher series with artist Steve Dillon, although no official announcement was made by Marvel. In 2003, Millar and artist Terry Dodson launched &quot;Trouble&quot; at Marvel&#x27;s newly-revived Epic imprint, a series meant to re-popularize romance comics that ended up both a sales and critical failure. That same year, Millar renewed his exclusive contract with Marvel for two more years. The following year, he penned two 12-issue runs for titles published under the Marvel Knights imprint, launching &quot;Marvel Knights Spider-Man&quot; again with Dodson and taking over the &quot;Wolverine&quot; ongoing series with artist John Romita, Jr. Millar and &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; writer Brian Michael Bendis launched a new ongoing series for the Ultimate Marvel imprint, &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; but left it after just six issues due to scheduling problems. Millar and artist Greg Land were announced as the creative team for a new &quot;Thor&quot; ongoing series but the pair took over &quot;Ultimate Fantatic Four&quot; instead. Millar&#x27;s return to the title introduced, among other things, the concept of Marvel Zombies. During this period, Millar was assigned to write a trilogy of mini-series that would introduce Galactus to the Ultimate Universe but he left the project due to other commitments at Marvel and health issues.

In 2006, after renewing his exclusive contract with Marvel for two more years, Millar launched the most well-known and best-selling work of his career, the 7-issue mini-series &quot;Civil War&quot; with artist Steve McNiven that acted as the centrepiece of the company-wide crossover storyline of the same name. The story revolved around the passing of the Superhuman Registration Act in response to the death and destruction unintentionally caused by superheroes on a regular basis and the resultant schism in the superheroic community, with Captain America and Iron Man taking opposing sides of the debacle. The storyline had lasting impact on the fictional Marvel Universe and served as the inspiration for the 2016 Marvel Studios film &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;.

In 2007 and 2008, Millar attempted to pitch a new series of Superman films to Warner Brothers but the studio went with David S. Goyer&#x27;s pitch for &quot;Man of Steel&quot; instead. During that time, he also had two pitches rejected at Marvel, a Blade story with Richard Corben and a Ghost Rider story with John Romita, Jr., as both characters already had ongoing series at the time and Marvel did not believe either property could support more books. In 2008, Millar returned to the &quot;Wolverine&quot; ongoing series for an extended dystopian storyline &quot;Old Man Logan&quot;, illustrated by his &quot;Civil War&quot; collaborator Steve McNiven. Elements of this story inspired the 2017 20th Century Fox film &quot;Logan&quot;. Also in 2008, Millar reteamed with &quot;The Ultimates&quot; co-creator Bryan Hitch for a run on the mainline &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series and launched the mini-series &quot;Marvel 1985&quot; with artist Tommy Lee Edwards. The three titles, running concurrently, are notable in that Millar purposefully wrote them as interlinked through the introduction of the character Clyde Wyncham, who also appeared in Millar&#x27;s creator-owned series &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; that was published under Marvel&#x27;s Icon imprint. In 2009, Millar returned to the Ultimate Universe with a number of limited series released under the &quot;Ultimate Comics: Avengers&quot; banner, his last Marvel work to date.

In 2011, Millar abandoned work-for-hire in favor of working full-time on his creator-owned properties.

===Millarworld===
In 2003, Millar introduced Millarworld, a unified label for his future creator-owned comics, set in a shared fictional universe. The initial line-up consisted of &quot;Wanted&quot; (published by Top Cow and subsequently adapted into a feature film starring Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman), &quot;Chosen&quot; (published by Dark Horse), &quot;The Unfunnies&quot; (published by Avatar) and the unreleased one-shot &quot;Run&quot;. Another unreleased project was &quot;King and Country&quot;, a political drama involving the British royal family repurposed from a TV series pitch Millar created in 2005. According to Millar, the book was supposed to be published in the form of a fully-painted graphic novel by a &quot;big book publisher&quot;. In 2008, the Millarworld line expanded with two new releases, &quot;War Heroes&quot; at Image, and &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, published under Marvel&#x27;s Icon imprint and adapted into a feature film two years later. The ownership of the Millarworld series is split 50/50 between Millar and the collaborating artist.

In 2010, Millar and British publisher Titan launched a pop culture-themed magazine &quot;CLiNT&quot; that featured serializations of Millar&#x27;s creator-owned comics as well as a number of short stories by up-and-coming creators submitted via the Millarworld forum. Other magazine contributors include Frankie Boyle, Stewart Lee, Jonathan Ross and Jimmy Carr. In 2011 and 2012, Millar organized the Kapow! Comic Convention in London. The 2011 Kapow! event was notable for setting two Guinness World Records, the &quot;Fastest Production of a Comic Book&quot; and &quot;Most Contributors to a Comic Book&quot;. Millar began work at 9 am, plotting a 20-page &quot;Superior&quot; story, followed by more than 60 comic book creators—including Sean Phillips, Dave Gibbons, Frank Quitely, John Romita Jr., Jock, Doug Braithwaite, Ian Churchill, Olivier Coipel, Duncan Fegredo, Simon Furman, David Lafuente, John McCrea, Liam Sharp—who appeared on stage throughout the day to create a panel each. The black-and-white book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes and 38 seconds, then published through Marvel&#x27;s Icon imprint on 23 November 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children&#x27;s Foundation. In 2015 and 2016, Millarworld held Talent Contest events where entrants had to write and/or draw short stories based on some of the company&#x27;s properties. The winning entries were published as two anthology specials in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Most of the Millarworld series have enjoyed interest from Hollywood over the years. In 2008, Michael De Luca optioned &quot;War Heroes&quot; for Columbia Pictures. In 2010, &quot;Nemesis&quot; was optioned by 20th Century Fox with Tony Scott attached to direct. Three years later, Fox optioned &quot;Starlight&quot;. 2014 saw the release of &quot;&quot;, directed by Matthew Vaughn. That same year, &quot;Superior&quot; was optioned by Fox with Vaughn attached as producer. The following year, &quot;Huck&quot; was picked up by Studio 8, while an adaptation of &quot;Chrononauts&quot; was announced to be in development by Universal. In 2016, Waypoint Entertainment optioned both &quot;Supercrooks&quot; and &quot;American Jesus&quot; (which had previously been optioned by Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s Marv Films in 2009), while Lorenzo di Bonaventura began development on &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot;. That same year, Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum signed on to produce &quot;Empress&quot; with &quot;&quot; writer F. Scott Frazier set to pen the screenplay.

In August 2017, it was announced that Millarworld has been purchased for an undisclosed sum by Netflix. Millar noted it was the third time in history a comic book company had been purchased by a production studio, comparing the buyout to the 1967 purchase of DC Comics by Kinney National Company (subsequently renamed to Warner Communications) and the 2009 acquisition of Marvel Comics by The Walt Disney Company. As part of the deal, Millar and his wife Lucy continued to run Millarworld as President and CEO, respectively, developing new properties to be produced by Netflix. Comics adapted to film before the deal, such as &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; and &quot;Kingsman&quot;, were not included in the package. The first of Millarworld properties to be adapted at Netflix was &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, which premiered in May 2021 with an eight-episode first season. It was followed by &quot;Super Crooks&quot;, an animated spin-off series released in November 2021.

===Public image===
Over the years, Millar has earned a reputation as a controversial and outspoken writer. In interviews, he openly criticized the business practices of the American comics industry in the 90s, the comic book writing trend of decompression popularized in the early 00s, the tendency of Big Two publishers to oversaturate the market with tie-ins and spin-offs in the mid-00s as well as the DC Comics&#x27; management of &quot;The Authority&quot; during his tenure as the title&#x27;s writer. In his writing, Millar has incorporated the themes of domestic abuse (&quot;The Ultimates&quot;), teenage pregnancy (&quot;Trouble&quot;), child molestation (&quot;The Unfunnies&quot;) and rape, the latter sometimes for comedic effect. In August 2013, when asked by Abraham Josephine Riesman of &quot;The New Republic&quot; about the use of rape as a plot device in more than one of his comics, Millar responded, &quot;The ultimate [act] that would be the taboo, to show how bad some villain is, was to have somebody being raped, you know. I don&#x27;t really think it matters. It&#x27;s the same as, like, a decapitation. It&#x27;s just a horrible act to show that somebody&#x27;s a bad guy.&quot; The comment drew criticism from industry peers and comic book journalists. Similar incidents include Millar publicly expressing amazement at the fact that non-caucasians can get Down&#x27;s syndrome and referring to all gamers as &quot;pedos&quot; in an interview.

Millar frequently employs unusual tactics to promote himself and his work, such as the public bet with Harry Knowles regarding the casting of the lead actor in then-upcoming Superman film in 2004, which Millar used as a way to advertise his run on &quot;Wolverine&quot;. That same year, Millar claimed that rapper Eminem was in talks to take the lead role of Wesley Gibson in the film adaptation of his creator-owned series &quot;Wanted&quot;, which resulted in public denial by Eminem&#x27;s management via &quot;Variety&quot;. In 2006, Millar auctioned the right to name the protagonist of his then-upcoming creator-owned series &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;. In 2016, he organized a &quot;treasure hunt&quot; for advance copies of &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot; hidden in ten cities around the world. In 2017, Millar established a charitable foundation and launched a multi-year campaign to promote it.

Throughout the 90s and early 00s, Millar was close friends with fellow Scottish writer Grant Morrison. The pair frequently collaborated on works published by British and American publishers and appeared together at various events. Morrison was seen as the mentor figure in their relationship, as evidenced by a humorous strip created by Garth Ennis and Dave Gibbons for an anniversary issue of &quot;2000 AD&quot; in which Millar appeared in the form of a small droid repeating a single phrase, &quot;me and Gwant&quot;. The pair was also parodied in an issue of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot; written by Gail Simone, shown fighting over whose then-ongoing X-Men series—Millar&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate&quot; or Morrison&#x27;s &quot;New&quot;—is more important. Sometime around 2004, Millar and Morrison seemingly cut all communication and never interacted in public again, which, according to Morrison, happened because Millar wanted to break away from the image of Morrison&#x27;s protégé after the success he had with &quot;The Authority&quot; and &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;. When asked about the state of their relationship in a 2011 interview, Morrison responded thus, &quot;I wish him well but, no, there is no good feeling between myself and Mark Millar for many reasons most of which are he destroyed my faith in human fucking nature.&quot;

===Awards and accolades===
In August 2011, Millar appeared in his native Coatbridge to unveil a superhero-themed steel archway beside the Monkland Canal, created by sculptor Andy Scott with the help from the students at St. Ambrose High School, Millar&#x27;s alma mater. The six-metre-high archway, created as part of the efforts to reinvigorate the canal, was inspired by Millar&#x27;s work, depicting a superhero named Captain Coatbridge and two superheroines.

In June 2013, Millar was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to film and literature on the Queen&#x27;s Honours Birthday list.

==Influences==
Millar has cited Alan Moore and Frank Miller as the two biggest influences on his career, characterising them as &quot;my Mum and Dad.&quot; Other comic book creators he names as influences include Dave Sim, Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Warren Ellis, and Garth Ennis.

In 2013, Millar listed &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;The Incredibles&quot; as his five favorite films.

==Personal life==
Millar is a practicing Catholic who abstains from using profanity in his personal life. He met his first girlfriend Gill, who lived nearby in Coatbridge and attended the same school as him, at the age of 17. The couple married in 1993 and divorced in early 2009. They have one daughter, Emily, who was born in 1998. Millar&#x27;s second wife, Lucy Unwin, gave birth to their first child in November 2011, and the second in March 2014. Millar and Unwin married in May 2016. As of 2010, they reside in Glasgow&#x27;s West End.

In 2005, Millar was diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease.

===Political views===
Speaking about his political views, Millar has described himself thus, &quot;I regard myself as traditionally left of centre and progressive, a Eurosceptic in the Bennite mould, and the policies espoused by the coalition formed under the Yes umbrella are the closest to my own particular ideology.&quot;

Before the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Millar was cited as a supporter of Scottish independence by groups such as the National Collective, and made comments interpreted in support of independence. However, in the run-up to the referendum, Millar stated that he was &quot;genuinely undecided&quot;. In a January 2015 interview with &quot;The Herald&quot;, he stated, &quot;Originally I was &quot;Yes&quot; and then about six months before I started having doubts, and then I just went silent on it because I saw the country going mad. People who I love were falling out with each other.&quot; In 2020, Millar explained on Twitter that he is not a &quot;tribalist&quot; when it comes to Scottish independence, stating, &quot;After the Blair era I was tempted for a year or two&quot; regarding the matter, but questioned whether an independent Scotland could function economically.

Millar supported British withdrawal from the European Union and endorsed a &quot;Leave&quot; vote during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, stating that it would be a path towards Scottish independence.

<text>A minehunter is a naval vessel that seeks, detects, and destroys individual naval mines. Minesweepers, on the other hand, clear mined areas as a whole, without prior detection of mines. A vessel that combines both of these roles is known as a mine countermeasures vessel (MCMV).

== Description ==
A minehunter uses an imaging sonar to detect and classify targets and then sends out divers or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to inspect and neutralise the threat, often using small charges that are detonated remotely.

As minehunters will often be operating in close proximity to mines, they are designed so as to reduce their own acoustic and magnetic signatures, two common forms of trigger for mines. For example, they are often soundproofed by mounting machinery on shock absorbers or by using quiet electrical drive, low magnetic electric motors and usually have a wood, fiberglass or non-ferrous metal hull, or are degaussed to reduce magnetic signature.

Minehunters are generally small, shallow-draught vessels, as they are often called upon to work in enclosed bodies of water such as shipping channels or harbours. As manoeuvrability in such areas is critical the Voith-Schneider cycloidal propulsor is commonly used, allowing the engine thrust to be transmitted in any direction. A number of modern vessels use catamaran hulls to provide a large, stable working platform with minimal underwater contact; this reduces draught whilst lowering acoustic transmission and reducing the fluid pressure generated by the moving hull that may otherwise detonate mines with a hydraulic pressure trigger.

==Coastal minehunter==
Coastal minehunters are ships that are designed to find, classify, and destroy moored and bottom mines from vital waterways. Coastal minehunters are generally smaller and with lower sea-keeping and endurance than oceangoing minehunters. They are usually tasked with keeping fixed high-value choke points clear of mines, such as the approaches to military ports and harbours. In a Cold War context it was especially important to protect those ports used by a nation&#x27;s ballistic missile submarines.

===Operation===
Minehunters differ from minesweepers in that minesweepers are used against older magnetic mines that are moored just below the surface. Minehunters are designed to seek out mines and destroy them individually, particularly against more advanced modern mines, which sit on the seabed and can be programmed to target specific vessel types (see CAPTOR mine). To do this they have mine-hunting sonar and can act as motherships and support craft for ROVs and combat divers. However, in some circumstances many minehunters can also destroy less advanced magnetic moored mines in the traditional manner.

<text>The Walther PP (, or police pistol) series pistols are blowback-operated semi-automatic pistols, developed by the German arms manufacturer Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen.

It features an exposed hammer, a double-action trigger mechanism, a single-column magazine, and a fixed barrel that also acts as the guide rod for the recoil spring. The series includes the Walther PP, PPK, PPK/S, and PPK/E models. The Walther TPH pocket pistol is a smaller calibre pistol introduced in 1971 which is identical in handling and operation to the PPK.

Various PP series are manufactured in Germany, France and the United States. In the past, the PPK version was manufactured by Walther in its own factory in Germany, as well as under licenses by Manurhin in France; Interarms in the US, and by Smith &amp; Wesson in the US. Since 2018, PPK and PPK/S models have been built at the factory of US-based subsidiary Walther Arms, Inc.

The PP and the PPK were among the world&#x27;s first successful double action semi-automatic pistols. The PPK and PP are still manufactured by Walther, but the PP went out of production between 1999 and 2024 and have been widely copied. The design inspired other pistols, among them the Soviet Makarov, the Hungarian FEG PA-63, the Czechoslovakian Vz. 50, the American Accu-Tek AT-380 II, and the Argentine Bersa Thunder 380. The PP and PPK were popular with both European police and civilians for being reliable and concealable. During World War II, they were issued to the German military (officers), including the Luftwaffe, as well as the uniformed Ordnungspolizei and plainclothes detectives of the Kriminalpolizei.

==PP series==

The original PP was released in 1929. It was designed for police use and was used by police forces in Europe in the 1930s and later. The semi-automatic pistol operated using a simple blowback action. The PP was designed with several safety features, some of them innovative, including an automatic hammer block, a combination safety/decocker and a loaded chamber indicator.

==Variants==

=== PPK ===
The most common variant is the Walther PPK, a smaller version of the PP with a shorter grip, barrel and frame, and reduced magazine capacity. A new, two-piece wrap-around grip panel construction was used to conceal the exposed back strap. The smaller size made it more concealable than the original PP and hence better suited to plain-clothes or undercover work. It was released in 1931.

&quot;PPK&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Polizeipistole Kriminal&quot; (literally &quot;police pistol criminal&quot;), referring to the crime investigation office. While the K is often mistakenly assumed to stand for &quot;kurz&quot; (German for &quot;short&quot;), as the variant has a shorter barrel and frame, Walther used the name &quot;Kriminal&quot; in early advertising brochures and the 1937 GECO German catalog.

The PPK saw widespread use. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler committed suicide with his PPK in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; in Berlin. A Walther PPK .32 (gun number 159270) was used by Kim Jae-gyu to kill South Korean leader Park Chung Hee. A PPK carried by Princess Anne&#x27;s personal police officer James Beaton infamously jammed during a kidnapping attempt on the princess and her husband.

The fictional secret agent James Bond uses a Walther PPK in many of the novels and films: Ian Fleming&#x27;s choice of Bond&#x27;s weapon directly influenced the popularity and notoriety of the PPK. Fleming had given Bond a .25 Beretta 418 pistol in early novels but switched to the PPK in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1958) on the advice of firearms expert Geoffrey Boothroyd. Although referred to as a PPK in the film adaption of 1962, the actual gun carried by actor Sean Connery was a Walther PP.

Actor Jack Lord, who played Felix Leiter in &quot;Dr. No&quot;, was presented with a gold-plated PPK with ivory handgrips, given to him by his friend Elvis Presley. Presley owned a silver-finish PPK, inscribed &quot;TCB&quot; (&quot;taking care of business&quot;).

=== PPK/S ===
The PPK/S was developed following the enactment of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA68) in the United States, the pistol&#x27;s largest market. One of the provisions of GCA68 banned the importation of pistols and revolvers not meeting certain requirements of length, weight, and other &quot;sporting&quot; features into the United States. The PPK failed the &quot;Import Points&quot; test of the GCA68 by a single point. Walther addressed this situation by combining the PP&#x27;s frame with the PPK&#x27;s barrel and slide to create a pistol that weighed slightly more than the PPK. The additional ounce or two of weight of the PPK/S compared to the PPK was sufficient to provide the extra needed import points.

Because U.S. law allowed domestic production (as opposed to importation) of the PPK, manufacture began under license in the U.S. in 1983; this version was distributed by Interarms. The version currently manufactured by Walther Arms in Fort Smith, Arkansas has been modified (by Smith &amp; Wesson) by incorporating a longer grip tang (S&amp;W calls it &quot;extended beaver tail&quot;), better protecting the shooter from slide bite, i.e., the rearward-traveling slide&#x27;s pinching the web between the index finger and thumb of the firing hand, which could be a problem with the original design for people with larger hands or an improper grip, especially when using more powerful cartridge loads. The PPK/S is made of stainless steel. There are also blued examples.

The PPK/S differs from the PPK as follows:
* Overall height: vs. 100 mm (3.9 in)
* Weight: the PPK/S weighs more than the PPK
* The PPK/S magazine holds one additional round, in both calibers.

The PPK/S and the PPK are offered in the following calibers: .32 ACP (with capacities of 8 for PPK/S and 7 for PPK); or .380 ACP (PPK/S: 7; PPK: 6). The PPK/S is also offered in .22 LR with capacity of 10 rounds.

=== PPK-L ===

In the 1960s, Walther produced the PPK-L, which was a lightweight variant of the PPK. The PPK-L differed from the standard, all steel PPK in that it had an aluminium alloy frame. These were only chambered in 7.65mm Browning (.32 ACP) and .22 LR because of the increase in felt recoil from the lighter weight of the gun. All other features of the postwar production PPK (brown plastic grips with Walther banner, high polished blue finish, lanyard loop, loaded chamber indicator, 7+1 magazine capacity and overall length) were the same on the PPK-L.
=== PP Super ===
First marketed in 1972, this was an all-steel variant of the PP chambered for the 9×18mm Ultra cartridge. Designed as a police service pistol, it was a blowback operated, double-action pistol with an external slide-stop lever and a firing-pin safety. A manual decocker lever was on the left side of the slide; when pushed down, it locked the firing pin and released the hammer. When the 9×19mm Parabellum was chosen as the standard service round by most of the German police forces, the experimental 9mm Ultra round fell into disuse. Only about 2,000 PP Super pistols were sold to German police forces in the 1970s, and lack of sales caused Walther to withdraw the PP Super from their catalogue in 1979.

=== L66A1 ===

In 1974, the British Royal Army Ordnance Corps purchased some thousand .22LR caliber Walther PP pistols for members of the Ulster Defence Regiment. They were issued as sidearms to be carried by off duty soldiers for personal protection during The Troubles. They had military markings unlike standard Walther PPs. They had black plastic grips and were parkerized. In the 1980s, the guns were coated with a lacquer called Suncorite, which was later found to be toxic and is no longer in use.

=== PPK/E ===
At the 2000 &quot;Internationale Waffen-Ausstellung&quot; (IWAInternational Weapons Exhibition) in Nuremberg, Walther announced a new PPK variant designated as the PPK/E. The PPK/E resembles the PPK/S and has a blue steel finish; it is manufactured under license by FEG in Hungary. Despite the resemblance between the two, certain PP-PPK-PPK/S parts, such as magazines, are not interchangeable with the PPK/E. Official factory photographs do not refer to the pistol&#x27;s Hungarian origins. Instead, the traditional Walther legend (&quot;Carl Walther Waffenfabrik Ulm/Do.&quot;) is stamped on the left side of the slide. The PPK/E is offered in .22 LR, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP calibers.

==Manufacturing==
Walther&#x27;s original factory was located in Zella-Mehlis in the state of Thuringia. As that part of Germany was occupied by the Soviet Union following World War II, Walther fled to West Germany, where they established a new factory in Ulm. For several years following the war, the Allied powers forbade any manufacture of weapons in Germany. As a result, in 1952, Walther licensed production of the PP series pistols to a French company, Manufacture de Machines du Haut-Rhin, also known as Manurhin. Manurhin made the parts but the pistol was assembled either at Saint-Étienne arsenal (marked &quot;Made in France&quot;) or by Walther in Ulm (marked &quot;Made in West Germany&quot; and having German proof-marks). The French company continued to manufacture the PP series until 1986.

In 1978, Ranger Manufacturing of Gadsden, Alabama was licensed to manufacture the PPK and PPK/S; this version was distributed by Interarms of Alexandria, Virginia. Ranger made versions of the PPK/S in both blued and stainless steel and chambered in .380 ACP and only made copies chambered in .32 ACP from 1997 to 1999. This license was eventually canceled in 1999. Walther USA of Springfield, Massachusetts briefly made PPKs and PPK/Ss directly through Black Creek Manufacturing from 1999 to 2001. From 2002, Smith &amp; Wesson (S&amp;W) began manufacturing the PPK and PPK/S under license at their plant in Houlton, Maine until 2013. In February 2009, S&amp;W issued a recall for PPKs it manufactured for a defect in the hammer block safety. In 2018 Walther Arms began producing them again at their new US manufacturing plant in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and new ones are being shipped as of March 2019.

<text>In physical cosmology, the age of the universe is the time elapsed since the Big Bang: 13.8 billion years. Astronomers have two different approaches to determine the age of the universe. One is based on a particle physics model of the early universe called Lambda-CDM, matched to measurements of the distant, and thus old features, like the cosmic microwave background. The other is based on the distance and relative velocity of a series or &quot;ladder&quot; of different kinds of stars, making it depend on local measurements late in the history of the universe. 
These two methods give slightly different values for the Hubble constant, which is then used in a formula to calculate the age. The range of the estimate is also within the range of the estimate for the oldest observed star in the universe.

==History==
In the 18th century, the concept that the age of Earth was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. Nonetheless, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was steady state and eternal, possibly with stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of thermodynamics, formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of entropy dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915, Albert Einstein published the theory of general relativity and in 1917 constructed the first cosmological model based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady-state universe, Einstein added what was later called a cosmological constant to his equations. Einstein&#x27;s model of a static universe was proved unstable by Arthur Eddington.

The first direct observational hint that the universe was not static but expanding came from the observations of &#x27;recession velocities&#x27;, mostly by Vesto M. Slipher, combined with distances to the &#x27;nebulae&#x27; (galaxies) by Edwin Hubble in a work published in 1929. Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, the Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. Spectra taken of these distant galaxies showed a red shift in their spectral lines presumably caused by the Doppler effect, thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble&#x27;s initial value for the universe&#x27;s age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the Hubble constant, was made in 1958 by astronomer Allan Sandage. His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.

Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. Sandage proposed new theories of cosmogony to explain this discrepancy. This issue was more or less resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2024, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the oldest known star is billion years.

The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation announced in 1965 finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart. In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson were trying to detect radio wave echoes with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious noise in the microwave region that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the Earth, the Sun, or the Milky Way galaxy, but from outside the Milky Way, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, Robert H. Dicke, Jim Peebles, and David Wilkinson, were attempting to detect low level noise that might be left over from the Big Bang and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and Planck, launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.

== Definition ==
Experimental observations confirm expansion of universe according to Hubble&#x27;s law. Since the universe is expanding, the equation for that expansion can be &quot;run backwards&quot; to its starting point. 
The Lambda-CDM concordance model describes the expansion of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.77 billion years of cosmological time. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP. The International Astronomical Union uses the term &quot;age of the universe&quot; to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently, the time elapsed within the currently observable universe since the Big Bang. The expansion rate at any time formula_1 is called the Hubble parameter 
formula_2
which is modeled as 
formula_3
where formula_4 are density parameters, with formula_5 for mass (baryons and cold dark matter), formula_6 for radiation (photons plus relativistic neutrinos), and formula_7 for dark energy. The value formula_8, called the Hubble constant, is the Hubble parameter today (formula_9) and it has units of inverse time. The age of the universe is then defined as
formula_10
The integral is close to 1 so formula_8 is close to the age of the universe.

==Observational limits==
Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations that put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include
* the temperature of the coolest white dwarfs, which gradually cool as they age, and
* the dimmest turnoff point of main sequence stars in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved away from the main sequence set a minimum age).
Before the incorporation of dark energy in the model of cosmic expansion, the age was awkwardly less than the oldest observed astronomical objects. This connection can be used in reverse: the oldest objects found constrain the values of the density parameter for dark energy.

==Cosmological parameters==
The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the ΛCDM model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold dark matter, radiation (including both photons and neutrinos), and a cosmological constant.

The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the density parametersformula_12 formula_13 and formula_14 The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the Hubble parameterformula_15, are the most important.

With accurate measurements of these parameters, the age of the universe can be determined by using the Friedmann equation. This equation relates the rate of change in the scale factorformula_16to the matter content of the universe. Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by integrating this formula. The ageformula_17is then given by an expression of the form
:formula_18
whereformula_15is the Hubble parameter and the functionformula_20depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe&#x27;s energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the Hubble time, the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value forformula_15around , the Hubble time evaluates to formula_22 billion years.

To get a more accurate number, the correction functionformula_20must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the Planck valuesformula_24(0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is aboutformula_25 For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner,formula_26is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure,formula_27is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the cosmic microwave background temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number. CMB measurements are very good at constraining the matter contentformula_12 and curvature parameter formula_29 It is not as sensitive toformula_30directly, partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift. The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameterformula_15are currently believed to come from measured brightnesses and redshifts of distant Type Ia supernovae. Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe &quot;older&quot; for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why globular clusters in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe. Introducing the cosmological constant allows the universe to be older than these clusters, as well as explaining other features that the matter-only cosmological model could not.

== Lookback time ==
Light observed from astronomical objects was emitted when the universe was younger. Astronomers use lookback time, formula_32, to describe the difference in the age of the universe here and now, formula_33, from the age at the time of emission, formula_34:
formula_35
where is an age.
The lookback time depends on the objects redshift and, like the age of the universe, the cosmological parameters selected.

==WMAP==
NASA&#x27;s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) project&#x27;s nine-year data release in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).

This age is based on the assumption that the project&#x27;s underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the microwave background power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination). The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe. Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one per cent.

==Planck==
In 2015, the Planck Collaboration estimated the age of the universe to be  billion years, slightly higher but within the uncertainties of the earlier number derived from the WMAP data.

In the table below, figures are within 68% confidence limits for the base ΛCDM model.

Legend:
*TT, TE, EE: Planck Cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra
*lowP: Planck polarization data in the low-ℓ likelihood
*lensing: CMB lensing reconstruction
*ext: External data (BAO+JLA+H0). BAO: Baryon acoustic oscillations, JLA: Joint Light curve Analysis, H0: Hubble constant

In 2018, the Planck Collaboration updated its estimate for the age of the universe to  billion years.

==Assumption of strong priors==
Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as strong priors and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result. The age given is thus accurate to the specified error, since this represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model.

The age of the universe based on the best fit to Planck 2018 data alone is billion years. 
An component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from Planck) is to use a Bayesian statistical analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model). This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.

<text>Tommy Tiernan (; born 16 June 1969) is an Irish comedian, actor, and writer. He is best known for his stand-up career, hosting &quot;The Tommy Tiernan Show&quot; (2017–present) and playing Gerry in the sitcom &quot;Derry Girls&quot; (2018–2022).

==Early life==
Tiernan was born in Carndonagh, County Donegal in 1969, the son of a mother from County Limerick and a father from County Kerry. He moved with his family as a child; after spells living in London and Zambia, he attended the Catholic ex-junior seminary St Patrick&#x27;s Classical School in Navan, where his schoolmates included Hector Ó hEochagáin and Dylan Moran.

==Career==
Tiernan has appeared several times on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. In the United States, he has appeared several times on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. He has also appeared on &quot;Michael McIntyre&#x27;s Comedy Roadshow&quot;, &quot;The Lee Mack Show&quot;, Dave&#x27;s &quot;One Night Stand&quot;, &quot;QI&quot;, and joined Eddie Izzard and Ross Noble at Laughs in the Park.

In &quot;Going to America&quot;, the final episode of the clerical sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;, Tiernan plays a young priest. In the 1999 Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Small Potatoes&quot;, Tiernan took the lead role of Ed Blewitt, an underachiever who works in an east London video rental shop. It ran for 13 episodes over 2 seasons, ending in 2001.

In 2008, Tiernan and Hector Ó hEochagáin formed as a radio duo on &quot;The Tommy and Hector Show&quot; on i102-104FM after hinting at a desire to be on the radio, months before on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Speaking about his role, Tiernan said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to have loads of craic on the radio. What better way to have a mountain of devilment than to do a show with my best friend.&quot; Following the success of their show on iRadio Northwest, the show moved to the nationwide slot of Saturday 10am-12pm on 2FM.

In 2007, some families of people with Down syndrome complained about a routine in Tiernan&#x27;s act about people with the condition. It had caused some surprise to some of the families as he previously ran a marathon in support of Down Syndrome Ireland.

An appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in 2008 led to complaints about Tiernan&#x27;s jokes involving a methadone user, Eastern European immigrant accents, buying a motorbike from an injured biker, and a film idea about &quot;gay Traveller spacemen&quot; seeking a cure for gayness, eight of which were upheld by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Some of his previous routines which went largely without remark included a comic reference to disproportionate American reaction to 9/11 and the indifferent Israeli attitude to foreign criticism of their occupations of surrounding land.

In September 2009, while being interviewed by Olaf Tyaransen for &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine at a pre-performance Q&amp;A session at Electric Picnic in County Laois, Tiernan was asked by an audience member if he had ever been accused of antisemitism. He responded by making remarks about the Holocaust and Jews and the death of Christ. He stated that a comedian should not be looked to for political correctness and said, &quot;These Jews, these fucking Jew cunts come up to me. Fucking Christ-killing bastards. Fucking six million? I would have got 10 or 12 million out of that. No fucking problem! Fuck them.&quot; He later suggested in several interviews that his points were intended as a commentary on how somebody&#x27;s words can easily be taken out of context when a small segment of a dialogue is quoted. The response of the audience was criticised as &quot;disappointing&quot; by Fine Gael&#x27;s Alan Shatter, who also said, &quot;I would regard it as particularly sad that people found that sort of outburst in any way amusing.&quot; Tiernan later released a statement that said he had not meant to cause offence and that his words had been taken out of context. He said that the comments were part of an attempt to explain his belief that comedians have a duty to be &quot;irresponsible and reckless&quot;, to allow &quot;whatever lunacy is within you to come out&quot;, and that they should never be taken out of context. He added that the statements that had caused controversy had been preceded by a statement not to take the rant seriously.

Catholic Archbishop Diarmuid Martin criticised the remarks, describing them as &quot;offensive to the Jewish community&quot; and &quot;offensive to all who feel revulsion concerning the Holocaust, one of the most horrific events in human history&quot;. He said, &quot;I can only decry the comments as insensitive and hurtful to the suffering of the victims and to a memory which is sacred.&quot; Holocaust Education Trust Ireland condemned Tiernan&#x27;s statements as &quot;appalling&quot;. Labour&#x27;s Ruairi Quinn, chairman of the Trust, said that &quot;as someone in the public eye, he has to take responsibility for his racist comments. We are equally concerned about the report of the audience&#x27;s reaction, which appears to have endorsed, sustained and enjoyed his comments. We would hope that the Irish public will choose to stay away from such racist &#x27;entertainment&#x27; in future&quot;. The Trust also condemned Tiernan&#x27;s outburst. Louis Lentin said Tiernan should be denied a visa for his shows in the U.S. in October. Lentin said Tiernan&#x27;s Electric Picnic comments were &quot;disgraceful&quot;, and &quot;extraordinarily racist.&quot; &quot;He doesn&#x27;t realise what he has said. He doesn&#x27;t realise the seriousness of it. You can&#x27;t make a joke about the Holocaust and just because you say it is a joke does not make it funny or acceptable&quot;.

Rabbi and comedian Bob Alper said that Tiernan&#x27;s statement on the subject was an attempt to &quot;weasel out&quot; of the situation.&quot;Hot Press&quot; editor Niall Stokes defended Tiernan: &quot;To interpret it as anti-Semitism is wrongheaded in the extreme. The way I see it, he is satirising anti-Semitism, while making a more general point that we should all be able to laugh at ourselves.&quot; Tyaransen, writing later in The Herald, wrote that neither he nor Tiernan had anticipated the response to Tiernan&#x27;s comments. He said the last question asked from the floor about a &quot;dogged charge of anti-Semitism&quot; led to the comments, and part of Tiernan&#x27;s response recounted criticism of his routine by a Jewish couple after a show in New York City. Tyaransen said that Tiernan&#x27;s comments had been taken out of context and that he personally saw the monologue as &quot;very funny&quot;.

In 2013, Tiernan performed in Vicar Street, Dublin, for his 200th show, in front of an audience of 1,000 people.

To date Tiernan has eight stand-up comedy DVDs: &quot;Tommy Tiernan Live&quot;, &quot;Cracked&quot;, &quot;Loose&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ok Baby&quot;, &quot;Bovinity&quot;, &quot;Crooked Man&quot; and &quot;Stray Sod&quot;.

On 5 January 2017, Tiernan presented the first episode of &quot;The Tommy Tiernan Show&quot; on RTÉ One.

Tiernan has starred as Da Gerry in the hit sitcom &quot;Derry Girls&quot; since 2018.

He was presenter of the &quot;Tommy and Hector Podcast with Laurita Blewitt&quot; from September 2020 until its closure in April 2024.

==Comic style==
When Tiernan started out, he wanted to be like Lenny Bruce. However, unlike Bruce, he does not regard himself as being a comedian &quot;with a message&quot;. He had admitted that his sense of humour is controversial, but claims that it is based on instinct and denies there is any malice in it.

Tiernan has three children with former partner Jayme Street He married Yvonne McMahon, his partner and manager, on 9 August 2009 at St. Patrick Catholic Church in County Monaghan; they had been together since December 2002. They also have three children.

==Awards==
In 1996, Tiernan won the Channel 4 &quot;So You Think You&#x27;re Funny&quot; award. Two years later he was awarded the Perrier Comedy Award at the 1998 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and won the Best Stand-Up Award at the British Comedy Awards. In 2003, he won the Nokia Best of the Fest Award and the Orange People Choice Award at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival. In 2006, he won Ireland&#x27;s Funniest Living Person Award at the People of the Year Awards.

<text>The Macquarie Marshes comprise the wetlands associated with the floodplains of the Macquarie River and its tributaries, in northern New South Wales, Australia. The Macquarie River and the marshes eventually drain into the Darling River. The marshes are important as a breeding site for waterbirds, especially in the aftermath of major floods.

==Description==
The marshes consist of a system of freshwater channels and streams, some of which are permanent following construction of water regulation devices, with semi-permanent and ephemeral swamps and floodplains. The extent of the marshes varies according to the extent of flooding. The historical maximum flooding of was recorded in the mid-1950s; since then flooding has become both less frequent and less extensive. Most of the area covered by the marshes is used as rangeland or pasture; some 10% is protected in the Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve. Among the variety of vegetation types supported by the marshes are river red gum forest and woodland, extensive beds of common reed, and meadows of water couch. Daily temperatures in the area vary from about in July to in January, with an average annual rainfall of to .

==Fauna==
The marshes support at least eight native and six introduced mammals, with 56 species of reptile, 15 species of frog and 16 species of freshwater fish.

==Birds==
The Macquarie Marshes have been identified by BirdLife International as a 2378 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA), defined by the maximum extent of the 1990 floods. Among over 200 species of birds recorded, the marshes have supported over 1% of the world population of the endangered Australasian bittern, as well as white-necked herons, intermediate egrets, nankeen night-herons, Australian white and straw-necked ibises, and sharp-tailed sandpipers. The IBA also supports a population of diamond firetails. Other birds recorded in substantial numbers include glossy ibises, great and little egrets, royal spoonbills, Pacific black ducks and Caspian terns. Australian painted snipes, superb parrots, painted and pied honeyeaters have been recorded in the IBA.

That is, every positive integer can be written as the sum of three or fewer triangular numbers, and as the sum of four or fewer square numbers, and as the sum of five or fewer pentagonal numbers, and so on. That is, the -gonal numbers form an additive basis of order .

==Examples==
Three such representations of the number 17, for example, are shown below:
*17 = 10 + 6 + 1 (&quot;triangular numbers&quot;)
*17 = 16 + 1 (&quot;square numbers&quot;)
*17 = 12 + 5 (&quot;pentagonal numbers&quot;).

==History==

The theorem is named after Pierre de Fermat, who stated it, in 1638, without proof, promising to write it in a separate work that never appeared.
Joseph Louis Lagrange proved the square case in 1770, which states that every positive number can be represented as a sum of four squares, for example, . Gauss proved the triangular case in 1796, commemorating the occasion by writing in his diary the line &quot;ΕΥΡΗΚΑ! &quot;, and published a proof in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. For this reason, Gauss&#x27;s result is sometimes known as the Eureka theorem. The full polygonal number theorem was not resolved until it was finally proven by Cauchy in 1813. The proof of is based on the following lemma due to Cauchy:

For odd positive integers and such that and we can find nonnegative integers , , , and such that

<text>Liquid Skin is the second album by English rock group Gomez, released on 13 September 1999 by Hut Records. Following the release of their debut studio album &quot;Bring It On&quot; (1998), the band began recording their follow-up between August 1998 and June 1999 at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Abbey Road Studios in London. Gomez were allowed to self-produce the sessions after their label heard the strength of their demos. Described as a blues rock album, &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; was compared to the work of Beck, the Grateful Dead, and Pearl Jam.

&quot;Liquid Skin&quot; received generally favourable reviews from critics, many of whom found it to be a retread of &quot;Bring It On&quot; with improved production. Preceded by a two-month tour of the United States, &quot;Bring It On&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; on 28 June 1999. Gomez appeared at a number of festivals, prior to the release of the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues Alibi&quot; on 30 August 1999. Coinciding with the release of &quot;Liquid Skin&quot;, the band embarked on tours of the US and the UK, which were then followed by its third single &quot;We Haven&#x27;t Turned Around&quot; on 8 November 1999. All three singles reached the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues Alibi&quot; peaking the highest at number 18.

==Background==
Gomez released their debut studio album &quot;Bring It On&quot; in April 1998. It peaked at number 11 in the UK, where it won the Mercury Music Prize. All three of its singles charted on the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;Whippin&#x27; Piccadilly&quot; reaching the highest at number 35. It was promoted with a tour of the United States supporting Eagle-Eye Cherry.

Based on the strength of the demos the band had made, their label let them self-produce their next album. Sessions for it began at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool in August 1998. By November 1998, the band were working at Abbey Road Studios, where they recorded strings, before moving to a mansion near Hastings. Guitarist Ian Ball said they moved so that they would be able to &quot;recreate the home-recorded sound of the first album, but in grander surroundings&quot;. They took a break to play a US tour with Mojave 3 in April and May 1999. Gomez had collectively recorded 32 songs during the recording sessions; they had finished in June 1999.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound of &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; has been described as blues rock, rooted in American blues and folk, with elements of art rock and psychedelic music. It has been compared to the work of Pearl Jam (specifically their 1996 album &quot;No Code&quot;), Beck, and the Grateful Dead. Acoustic guitars lead the majority of the songs, which are accompanied by horns, strings, and keyboards. There is a bigger emphasis on vocals and harmonies; in contrast to &quot;Bring It On&quot;, which typically featured one singer per track, most of the songs on &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; had all three (Ball, guitarist Tom Gray, and guitarist Ben Ottewell). Ottewell theorised that the band&#x27;s experience travelling in Australia, Europe and the United States influenced their writing. The album&#x27;s title went through multiple names – &quot;God&#x27;s Big Spaceship&quot; and &quot;Touching Up&quot; – before settling on &quot;Liquid Skin&quot;, which was inspired by a product they had found while in the United States. They almost called it &quot;Liquid State&quot;, though Gray said that as a title it was &quot;not as good as &#x27;Liquid Skin&#x27;.&quot; Ball described it as a &quot;party record&quot;, with the &quot;general theme&quot; being &quot;how many different ways we can play the same song in four minutes&quot;.

The sitar-driven opening track, &quot;Hangover&quot;, deals with love and being drunk, according to Gray. It is a delta blues song that opens with Ken Nelson misquoting the opening line from Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979), followed by a loud bassline. &quot;Revolutionary Kind&quot; sees the band mix country and techno, recalling the work of Alabama 3. Gray wrote the song in a house on Ash Grove in Leeds; when they were recording it, the hall they were tracking in would burn down frequently. &quot;Bring It On&quot;, the name of which alludes to the band&#x27;s debut, includes a reference to that album&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Get Miles&quot;. It ends with a raga rock coda; the song was written around the same time as &quot;Tijuana Lady&quot; (from &quot;Bring It On&quot;), though was abandoned and left off their debut. Gray wrote &quot;Blue Moon Rising&quot; as a reaction to the death of Princess Diana. &quot;Las Vegas Dealer&quot; begins as a psychedelic piece and vocal harmonies in the vein of the Moody Blues, before incorporating Eastern rhythms. Ball said it was written about a drunken night while in Las Vegas, Nevada, with Nuno Bettencourt&#x27;s father.

&quot;We Haven&#x27;t Turned Around&quot; features cellos; it originally began under the title &quot;Canderel&quot; with a different chorus section. &quot;Fill My Cup&quot; transitions over the course of its length from blues to skate metal, with two middle eight sections. &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues Alibi&quot; was written by Ball while attending university; Ottewell saw it as &quot;taking the piss out of R&amp;B music&quot; and &quot;the band and probably me, particularly!&quot;. Ball was playing guitar with a Zoom Sampletrak sampler, when Gray suggested using some of the parts from it as the song&#x27;s bridge section. Gray described the song as being a dig at a lot of &quot;landfill RnB in the late-90s, but we were also saying that we were dicks appropriating black culture&quot;. &quot;California&quot; is a slow-building song that incorporates droning, and switches to a boogie; throughout this, the song details escaping California. The composition of the song was completed while backstage during a show with Mojave 3 at the Troubadour in West Hollywood. The closing track, &quot;Devil Will Ride&quot;, uses a vocoder and marching band horns, concluding with a Beatlesque fadeout. Ball said the song was known under the working title of &quot;God&#x27;s Big Spaceship&quot;.

==Release==
Gomez embarked on a tour of the US in April and May 1999, where they were supported by Mojave 3; they cancelled shows in Europe to focus on the US. On 20 June 1999, &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; was announced for release in three months&#x27; time. &quot;Bring It On&quot; was released as the lead single from the album on 28 June 1999. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Dire Tribe&quot; and &quot;M57&quot;, while the second included &quot;Chicken Bones&quot; and &quot;Step Inside&quot;. They then appeared at the Glastonbury, T in the Park and V Festivals over the next two months. &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues Alibi&quot; was released as a single on 30 August 1999. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;The Best in Town&quot; and &quot;So&quot;, while the second included a &quot;pre-mellotron&quot; version of &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues Alibi&quot;, &quot;ZYX&quot;, and a live version of &quot;Tijuana Lady&quot; (under the name &quot;Tijuanalaska&quot;).

&quot;Liquid Skin&quot; was released through Hut Records on 13 September 1999; its US release occurred a week later. Coinciding with this, the band went on a tour of the US and then the UK in October and November 1999. &quot;We Haven&#x27;t Turned Around&quot; was released as a single on 8 November 1999. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Flight&quot; and &quot;Rosemary&quot;, while the second featured an &quot;X-Ray&quot; version of &quot;We Haven&#x27;t Turned Around&quot;, &quot;Gomez in a Bucket (A Seaside Town Made of Ice Cream, Slowly Melting)&quot;, and &quot;Emergency Surgery&quot;.

&quot;Bring It On&quot; and &quot;We Haven&#x27;t Turned Around&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s second compilation album, &quot;Five Men in a Hut: A&#x27;s, B&#x27;s and Rarities 1998–2004&quot; (2004). &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; was packaged with &quot;Bring It On&quot; as a two-CD combo in 2003. The band&#x27;s first four studio albums and &quot;Five Men in a Hut: A&#x27;s, B&#x27;s and Rarities 1998–2004&quot;, were collected together as &quot;5 Album Set&quot; in 2012. &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; was reissued in 2019 as a two-CD set that included a live show, demos, and alternative versions. Ball had become the band&#x27;s archivist and helped bring the reissue to fruition. Following this, the band toured across the UK and Australia, where they played the album in its entirety.

==Reception==

&quot;Liquid Skin&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that the band had been referred to as roots rock, &quot;but one listen to their sophomore CD shows they’re twisting those roots into strange and marvelous shapes&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine saw the album as a &quot;cleaner, more streamlined version&quot; of &quot;Bring It On&quot;, adding that they perform music &quot;that they believe to be experimental or rootsy, but not quite going far enough in either direction&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; Piers Martin also found it to be &quot;very much like&quot; their debut, &quot;only bigger, even more confident and with far better production&quot;.

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Richard Cromelin said Gomez had &quot;a free-ranging imagination, twisting and distorting and juxtaposing [their songs] with an exhilarating sense of freedom&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; editor Sarah Zupko wrote that band had &quot;picked up a few new studio tricks or two and rounded out their sound with fuller textures and better-produced mixes&quot;. She added that the &quot;back-to-the-country-sounding songs&quot; had a &quot;trippy vibe,&quot; and were &quot;just as good as ever&quot;. In a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, journalist Greg Kot wrote that &quot;the arrangements on &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; are more substantial, beefed up with strings and horns, and the songs sturdier&quot; than those on &quot;Bring It On&quot;.

&quot;Bring It On&quot; reached number 21 in singles chart. &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues Alibi&quot; reached number 18. &quot;We Haven&#x27;t Turned Around&quot; reached number 38. &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; ranked the album at number 13 on their list of the Top 30 Editorial Picks of 1999. &quot;PopMatters&quot; included it on their Most Memorable Albums of the year list.

<doc id="847900" wikidata="Q862072" url="?curid=847900" title="Conchology">
<text>Conchology () is the study of mollusc shells. Conchology is one aspect of malacology, the study of molluscs; however, malacology is the study of molluscs as whole organisms, whereas conchology is confined to the study of their shells. It includes the study of land and freshwater mollusc shells as well as seashells and extends to the study of a gastropod&#x27;s operculum.

Conchology is now sometimes seen as an archaic study, because relying on only one aspect of an organism&#x27;s morphology can be misleading. However, a shell often gives at least some insight into molluscan taxonomy, and historically the shell was often the only part of exotic species that was available for study. Even in current museum collections it is common for the dry material (shells) to greatly exceed the amount of material that is preserved whole in alcohol.

Conchologists mainly deal with four molluscan orders: the gastropods (snails), bivalves (clams), Polyplacophora (chitons) and Scaphopoda (tusk shells). Cephalopods only have small internal shells, with the exception of the Nautiloidea. Some groups, such as the sea slug nudibranchs, have lost their shells altogether, while in others it has been replaced by a protein support structure.

== Versus shell collecting ==
The terms &quot;shell collector&quot; and &quot;conchologist&quot; can be regarded as two distinct categories. Not all shell collectors are conchologists; some are primarily concerned with the aesthetic value of shells instead of their scientific study. It is also true that not all conchologists are shell collectors; this type of research only requires access to private or institutional shell collections. There is some debate in the conchological community, with some people regarding all shell collectors (regardless of motivation) as conchologists.

== History ==
Shell collecting, the precursor of conchology, dates back thousands of years. Archaeologists have sometimes uncovered Stone Age oceanic seashell necklaces in areas far from the ocean, indicating that they were traded, and shell jewellery has been found at archaeological sites around the world.

During the Renaissance people began collecting natural objects of beauty for private cabinets of curiosities. Because of their attractiveness, variety, durability and ubiquity, shells frequently became a large part of such collections. Scientific interest began to develop towards the end of the 17th century, and in 1681 The Jesuit priest Filippo Bonanni published the two-volume atlas &quot;Ricreazione dell&#x27;occhio et della mente nell&#x27;osservazione delle chiocciole&quot; (&quot;Recreation of the eye and of the mind in the observation of molluscs&quot;), the first treatise devoted entirely to mollusc shells. In 1692 Martin Lister published &quot;Historia Conchyliorum&quot;, a comprehensive conchological text with more than 1,000 engraved plates.

George Rumpf, or &quot;Rumphius&quot;, (1627–1702) published the first genuine mollusc taxonomy. He suggested the categories &quot;single shelled ones&quot; (modern Polyplacophora, limpets, and abalone), &quot;snails or whelks&quot; (Gastropoda), and &quot;two-shelled ones&quot; (Bivalvia). He did not include the tusk shells or the internal shells of the cephalopods.

Many of Rumpf&#x27;s terms were later adopted by Carl Linnaeus. The study of zoology, including conchology, was revolutionized by Linnaeus and his system of binomial nomenclature. Six hundred eighty three of the approximately 4,000 animal species Linnaeus described are now considered to be molluscs, although Linnaeus placed them in several different phyla at the time. The English word &quot;conchology&quot; was coined in the 1770s by the British Sephardi naturalist Emanuel Mendes da Costa, who published &quot;The Elements of Conchology: or, an Introduction to the Knowledge of Shells&quot; in London in 1776.

Since 1700 a number of prominent conchologists have published their studies of shells. John Mawe (1764–1829) produced arguably the first conchology guidebook, &quot;The Voyager&#x27;s Companion or Shell-Collector&#x27;s Pilot&quot;, as well as &quot;The Linnæan System of Conchology&quot;. Hugh Cuming (1791–1865) is famous for his huge collection and numerous discoveries of new species. Thomas Say wrote the fundamental work &quot;American Conchology, or Descriptions of the Shells of North America, Illustrated From Coloured Figures From Original Drawings, Executed from Nature&quot; in six volumes (1830–1834).

R. Tucker Abbott was arguably the most prominent conchologist of the 20th century, authoring dozens of books and working as museum director of the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum. His most best-known works are &quot;American Seashells&quot;, &quot;Seashells of the World&quot;, and &quot;The Kingdom of the Seashell&quot;. John DuPont is also known for his extensive collection which he donated to the Delaware Museum of Natural History in 1984. The Japanese emperor Hirohito also amassed a huge collection, and was a competent and respected amateur conchologist.

In 1950, Joyce Allan, an Australian conchologist working as curator of shells at the Australian Museum, authored &quot;Australian Shells.&quot; This was the first book to catalogue the majority of Australian molluscs in detail and was highly regarded within the scientific community and mollusc collectors.

== Museums ==
Many museums worldwide contain very large and scientifically important shell collections. However, in most cases these are research collections not as readily accessible to the general public as exhibits.

 the world&#x27;s largest assemblage of mollusc shells was held by the Smithsonian Institution, which has c. 1 million lots representing perhaps 50,000 species. The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture also has a large collection which was donated by Dr. Phil Nudelman in 2013. It includes about 100,000 specimens and 24,000 species, mostly from the Indo-Pacific region, the Caribbean, and the Mediterranean.

== Organizations ==
Like other scientific fields, conchologists have a number of local, national, and international organizations. There are also many organizations specializing in specific subareas.

* Association Française de Conchyliologie 
*Belgian Society for Conchology
*Club Conchylia, the German/Austrian Society for Shell Collecting
*Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland
*Conchologists of America
*Conquiliologistas do Brasil
*Nederlandse Malacologische Vereniging
*Unitas Malacologica

== Depictions of shells on stamps and coins ==
Shells have been featured on over 5,000 postage stamps worldwide, and have been featured on many coins including the Bahamian dollar (1974), the Cuban peso (1981), the Haitian gourde (1973), the Nepalese rupee (1989) and Philippine peso (1993).

<doc id="847902" wikidata="Q7711258" url="?curid=847902" title="That Peter Kay Thing">
<text>That Peter Kay Thing is a British mockumentary series which was first shown on Channel 4 in 2000. It was written by Peter Kay, Dave Spikey, Neil Fitzmaurice and Gareth Hughes, and was directed by Andrew Gillman. The series was narrated by Andrew Sachs, with the exception of the pilot, which was narrated by Kay. Set in and around Bolton, each episode functions as a self-contained documentary following a different set of characters, many of them played by Kay. The pilot episode, &quot;The Services&quot;, was shown in 1998 as an episode of &quot;Comedy Lab&quot;, a series which showcased pilots of experimental comedy shows. Many of the characters went on to appear in the successful spin-off series &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;.

==Episode list==
==Characters==
*Brian Potter (Kay) – Notoriously selfish social secretary of the working men&#x27;s club The Neptune. He lost the use of his legs when his former club flooded. It is suggested that he can actually walk, as at the end of the episode he is seen to stand whilst remonstrating with a group of firefighters.
*Max and Paddy (Kay and Paddy McGuinness) – Two inept bouncers at the Neptune.
*Jerry St. Clair (Dave Spikey) – Part-time builder and compère at the Neptune Club, and a previous winner of Talent Trek.
*Les Alanos – The Neptune&#x27;s house band, Les (Toby Foster) and Alan (Steve Edge). Les originally worked with Alan&#x27;s father before he left to form the tribute band &quot;Right Said Frank&quot;.
*Paul le Roy (Kay) – A local disc jockey for the radio station Chorley FM. He is obsessed with the music of the 1980s. He sports a mullet and has a long-suffering wife.
*Keith Lard (Kay) – An overly zealous local fire safety inspector who, it is alleged, interferes with dogs.
*Patrick O&#x27;Neil (Kay) – A cheeky employee at the Apollo Bingo Hall, who along with his friend &quot;Sparky&quot; (Alex Lowe), causes havoc in the Apollo.
*Tom Dale (Kay) – A Liverpudlian bingo caller known for his bizarre pre-show preparations and his catchphrase &quot;Let&#x27;s tickle those balls&quot;.
*Rose and Theresa (Kay and Beatrice Kelley) – Two middle-aged bingo fans who assume anyone who wins is sleeping with Tom Dale.
*Mr. Softy Top, aka Robert Edge (Kay) – A third generation ice cream man who hates children.

*Signór Whippee (Kay) – An ice cream man and Mr. Softy Top&#x27;s rival.
*Darren Bramwell (Kristian Tiffany) – A college student who works for Mr. Softy Top on weekends.
*Matthew Kelly (Kay) – An aspiring Irish actor who is unhappily stuck in several part-time jobs.
*Johnny Utah, aka Craig (Kay) – A surly Wild West obsessive, who works as a coach driver.
*Duncan Beach (Daniel Kitson) – A St. John Ambulance volunteer who is devoted to his job, but treated with contempt by those he treats.
*Chris Choi (Neil Fitzmaurice) – One half of the security group Live Sec.
*Shaun Ballen (Kay) – The other half of the security group Live Sec.
*Carol and Edina (Jo Enright and Lynda Thornhill) Two Concertgoers dressed up in fitting attire for the 70&#x27;s music show.
*Leonard de Tomkinson (Kay) – An elderly, kindly local eccentric. Due to angina he is unable to work, but has a paper round and is, therefore, Britain&#x27;s oldest paperboy.
*Marc Park (Kay) – An aspiring pop star, and former greengrocer, who looks like Mick Hucknall. He has a dog called Lady.
*Cheryl Avenue (Claire Rhodes) – An aspiring pop star, and former member of Park Avenue, she is the former long suffering partner of Marc Park and mother to his child. She later gained a pop career in her own right while also making her ex look bad much to Marc&#x27;s chagrin. 
*Pearl Hardman (Kay) – A would-be career woman who manages a Bolton service station.
*Alan McClarty (Kay) – An emotionally unstable Scottish mechanic who has worked for the RAC before his wife left him and he had a nervous breakdown. He now runs his own breakdown company, &quot;ARC&quot;.
==Reception==
&quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot; won the Best New TV Comedy award at the British Comedy Awards.

==Legacy==
A number of the characters in &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot;, including Brian Potter, Max and Paddy, and Jerry St Clair went on to become central characters in the highly successful spinoff series &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; and &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;.

In Episode 1, it was claimed Brian joined the Neptune club as a new member of staff, however this is inaccurate as his former club before, the Aquarius, as seen in &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;, still features all the Neptune&#x27;s staff and committee.

<text>A pantyliner (also pantiliner, panty liner or panty shield, vaginal cover) is an absorbent piece of material used for feminine hygiene. It is worn in the gusset of a woman&#x27;s panties. Some uses include: absorbency for daily vaginal discharge, light menstrual flow, tampon and menstrual cup backup, spotting, post-intercourse discharge, and urinary incontinence.
Panty liners can also help with girls who are having discharges and about to start their cycle.
Pantyliners are related to sanitary napkins in their basic construction—but are usually much thinner and often narrower than pads. As a result, they absorb much less liquid than pads—making them suitable for light discharge and everyday cleanliness. They are generally unsuitable for menstruation with medium to heavy flow, which requires them to be changed more often.

Pantyliners are found in an assortment of sizes, shapes, and portability options, ranging from tiny, compact liners to long, protective liners designed for heavy vaginal discharge and light days (light menstrual flow). There are also styles designed to fit with thong underwear.

Disposable pantyliners are made with a sticky adhesive on the back of the pad to hold them in place in the panties, and some styles have &quot;wings&quot; which wrap around the panties, providing additional stability.

<doc id="847908" wikidata="Q207631" url="?curid=847908" title="Mátyás Rákosi">
<text>Mátyás Rákosi (; born Mátyás Rosenfeld; 9 March 1892 – 5 February 1971) was a Hungarian communist politician who was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Hungary from 1947 to 1956. He served first as General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party from 1945 to 1948 and then as General Secretary (later renamed First Secretary) of the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party from 1948 to 1956.

Rákosi had been involved in left-wing politics since his youth, and in 1919 was a leading commissar in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic. After the fall of the Communist government, he escaped the country and worked abroad as an agent of the Comintern. He was arrested in 1924 after attempting to return to Hungary and organize the Communist Party underground, and ultimately spent over fifteen years in prison. He became a cause célèbre in the international Communist movement, and the predominantly Hungarian Rákosi Battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War bore his name. Rákosi was finally allowed to leave for the Soviet Union in 1940 in exchange for prized battle flags captured by Tsarist Russian forces after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.

As the Red Army drove the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; out of Hungary at the end of World War II, Rákosi returned to his home country in early 1945 and became the leader of the re-founded Hungarian Communist Party. The party suffered a crushing defeat in Hungary&#x27;s postwar free election, at the hands of the agrarian Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party; however, at Moscow&#x27;s insistence the Communists received key positions in the government including the Interior Ministry, while Rákosi himself became a heavily influential deputy prime minister. From this position, the Communists were able to use political intrigue, subterfuge, and conspiracy to destroy their opponents piece by piece, in what Rákosi would later term &quot;salami tactics&quot;. By 1948, they had gained total power over the country, and in 1949 the country was proclaimed a people&#x27;s republic with Rákosi as its absolute ruler.

Rákosi was an ardent Stalinist, and his government was very loyal to the Soviet Union; he even set up a personality cult of his own, modeled on that of Stalin. He presided over the mass imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian people, and the deaths of thousands. He orchestrated show trials modeled on those of the USSR, among the most prominent victims of which was his former lieutenant László Rajk. His policies of collectivization and mass repression devastated the country&#x27;s economy and political life, causing massive discontent. After the death of Stalin in 1953, Rákosi was partially demoted at Moscow&#x27;s behest and the reformist Communist Imre Nagy became the new prime minister; however, Rákosi was able to use his continuing influence as First Secretary to thwart all of Nagy&#x27;s attempts at reform and ultimately force the latter out of office in 1955.

After Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s famous &quot;Secret Speech&quot; in early 1956 denouncing the crimes of Stalin, Rákosi found his position fatally compromised. Large numbers of people within the party and society at large began to speak out against him and call for his resignation, as information about the Party&#x27;s past abuses came to light. Rákosi was finally forced to resign in July 1956 and leave for the Soviet Union, replaced by his second-in-command Ernő Gerő. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 occurred barely three months later as a result of the abuses of Rákosi&#x27;s system, and his former rival Imre Nagy became a dominant figure in the Revolution. Soviet troops ultimately crushed the uprising and installed a new Communist government under János Kádár.

Rákosi lived out the rest of his life in exile in the Soviet Union, denied permission to return home by the Hungarian government, out of fear of mass unrest. He died in Gorky in 1971, and his ashes were returned to Hungary in secret. Rákosi is generally seen as a symbol of tyranny and oppression in Hungary.

==Early years==

Rákosi was born in Ada, a village in Bács-Bodrog County in the Kingdom of Hungary (now a town in Vojvodina, Serbia). Born to Jewish parents, the fourth son of József Rosenfeld, a grocer, his mother Cecília Léderer would give birth to seven more children. Of his younger siblings the most notable was Ferenc Rákosi (later Biró, 1904–2006), an administrator, who also became active in Communist politics and was, for a time, General Manager of the Mátyás Rákosi Steel and Metal Works during his brother&#x27;s rule. His other siblings were Béla (1886–1944), Jolán (1888–?), Matild Gizella (1890–?), Izabella (1895–?), Margit (1896–1932), Zoltán (1898–?), Mária (1902–1938), Dezső (1906–?) and Hajnal (1908–1944). József, Béla and Hajnal were killed during the Holocaust. 

Rákosi&#x27;s paternal grandfather participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848; as a result, he had to flee the village following the defeat. Rákosi&#x27;s father, József Rosenfeld, was called &quot;Kossuth&#x27;s Jew&quot; by the villagers, because he had been a member and avid supporter of the oppositionist Party of Independence and &#x27;48. He changed his surname Rosenfeld to Rákosi in 1903. He later repudiated religion and in common with most other Marxists described himself as an atheist and opponent of organised religion.

Rákosi was a diligent and good student during his childhood. He finished his elementary studies in Sopron, then took his final exam at the High Technical Gymnasium of Szeged in 1910. He then studied external trade at the Eastern Commerce Academy. He won scholarships for a year each in Hamburg (1912) and London (1913).

While still a student in Hungary, he joined the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) in 1910 and was also a secretary and active member of the anarcho-syndicalist student movement, the Galilei Circle. 

He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War and was captured on the Eastern Front in 1915 and held as a prisoner-of-war in Far Eastern POW camps by the Russians until the end of the war. Taking advantage of the chaotic situation in Russia, he successfully escaped from his detention and moved to Petrograd, centre of the Bolshevik Revolution.

==Early career==

After returning to Hungary, he participated in the communist movement of Béla Kun and also joined the Party of Communists in Hungary. During the short-lived 133-day Communist rule after the resignation of President Mihály Károlyi, when the Hungarian Soviet Republic was established, Rákosi served as Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Trade from 21 March to 3 April in the Revolutionary Governing Council led by Sándor Garbai. Between 3 April and 24 June 1919, Rákosi was one of the six people&#x27;s commissars for social production, alongside Jenő Varga, Antal Dovcsák, Gyula Hevesi, József Kelen and Ferenc Bajáki. He was also involved in the Hungarian Red Army&#x27;s Northern and Eastern military campaigns against the newly formed Czechoslovakia and Romania. At the end of July 1919, he was promoted to Commander of the internal law-enforcement Red Guard for a short time.
Following the Soviet Republic&#x27;s fall, Rákosi fled Hungary on 2 August 1919 via the Austrian border, eventually to the Soviet Union where he worked as part of the Communist International, including representing it at the Livorno Congress of the Italian Socialist Party in 1921. After returning to Hungary in 1924, he was imprisoned, but he was released to the Soviet Union in 1940, in exchange for the Hungarian revolutionary banners captured by Russian troops at Világos in 1849. In the Soviet Union, he became leader of the Comintern. In 1942, he married divorced lawyer Feodora (Fenia) Kornilova, a woman of Yakut origin. He returned to Debrecen, Hungary, on 30 January 1945, having been selected by the Soviet authorities to organise the Hungarian Communist Party.

==Leader of Hungary==
When the Red Army set up a Soviet-approved government in Hungary (1944–1945), Rákosi was appointed General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party (MKP) (1945). He was a member of the High National Council from 27 September to 7 December 1945. Rákosi was deputy prime minister from 1945 to 1949, and was acting prime minister from 1 to 4 February 1946 and on 31 May 1947.

Initially, Rákosi and the Communists appeared willing to work within the system. From 1947 onwards, however, he and the Communists began pressuring the other parties to exclude those not willing to work with the Communists on the grounds that they were &quot;fascists&quot; or fascist sympathisers. Later on, after the Communists won complete control, it was commonly believed that Rákosi referred to this practice as &quot;salami tactics,&quot; saying he had destroyed the non-Communist forces in the country by &quot;cutting them off like slices of salami.&quot; However, no verified source for the &quot;salami&quot; quote has ever been discovered. According to historian Norman Stone, the term might have been invented by the leader of the Hungarian Independence Party, Zoltán Pfeiffer.

The process began when Smallholder Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy was forced to resign in favour of a more pliant Smallholder, Lajos Dinnyés. By the 1947 elections, the Communists had won a plurality, and had largely emasculated the next-largest non-Communist Party, the Social Democrats.

By October 1947, Rákosi had dropped all pretense of liberal democracy. He gave the non-Communist parties an ultimatum: cooperate with a new, Communist-dominated coalition government or go into exile. By the end of 1947, the opposition parties had largely shunted aside their more courageous members, leaving them in the hands of fellow travellers willing to do the Communists&#x27; bidding. In the summer of 1948, the Communists forced the Social Democrats to merge with them to form the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (MDP). However, the few remaining independent-minded Social Democrats were quickly pushed out in short order, leaving the MDP as an enlarged and renamed MKP. 

He also pushed out the Smallholder president, Zoltán Tildy, in favour of Social Democrat-turned-Communist Árpád Szakasits, and forced Dinnyés to resign in favour of the openly pro-Communist István Dobi. A year later, elections took place with a single list of candidates. Although non-Communists nominally still figured, in reality they were fellow travellers.

Rákosi described himself as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s best Hungarian disciple&quot; and &quot;Stalin&#x27;s best pupil&quot;. At the height of his rule, he developed a strong cult of personality around himself.

Approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were purged under his rule, from 1948 to 1956. Rákosi imposed totalitarian rule on Hungary — arresting, jailing and killing both real and imagined foes in various waves of Stalin-inspired political purges. In August 1952, he also became Prime Minister (Chairman of the Council of Ministers).

However, in June 1953, Rákosi and other party leaders were summoned to Moscow, where the Soviet leadership dressed down their Hungarian counterparts for Hungary&#x27;s lackluster economic performance. On 13 June 1953, to appease the Soviet Politburo, Rákosi accepted the Soviet model of collective leadership. While he gave up the premiership to Imre Nagy, he retained the office of General Secretary. Nagy favoured a more humane way of governing, which Rákosi vigorously opposed. On 9 March 1955, the Central Committee of the MDP condemned Nagy for &quot;rightist deviation.&quot; Hungarian newspapers joined the attacks and Nagy was blamed for the country&#x27;s economic problems. On 18 April, the National Assembly unanimously sacked Nagy from his post. Although the Kremlin frowned on a return of Rákosi to the premiership, he and Nagy&#x27;s successor, András Hegedüs, quickly put the country back on its previous Stalinist course. 

===Economic policy===

The post-war Hungarian economy suffered from multiple challenges. The most important was the destruction of infrastructure in the war (40% of national wealth, including all bridges, railways, raw materials, machinery, etc.). Hungary agreed to pay war reparations totalling approximately US$300 million, to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and to support Soviet garrisons. 

The Hungarian National Bank in 1946 estimated the cost of reparations as &quot;between 19 and 22 percent of the annual national income.&quot; In spite of this, after the highest historical rate of inflation in world history, a new, stable currency was successfully introduced in August 1946 on the basis of the plans of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. The low production of consumer goods and the backwardness of light industry resulted in frequent shortages, especially in the countryside, leading to discontent. In addition, the huge investments in military sectors after the outbreak of the Korean War further reduced the supply of consumer goods. Due to shortages, forced savings (state bond sales to the population) and below-inflation wage increases were introduced.

==Forced retirement==
Rákosi was then removed as General Secretary of the Party under pressure from the Soviet Politburo in June 1956 (shortly after Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech), and was replaced by his former second-in-command, Ernő Gerő.
To remove him from the Hungarian political scene, the Soviet Politburo exiled Rákosi to the Soviet Union later in 1956, with the official story being that he was &quot;seeking medical attention&quot;. From 1964 to 1968 he lived in the town of Tokmok in Soviet Kirghizia. Later he was sent to Arzamas and, later still, to Gorky.

In 1970, Rákosi was finally granted permission to return to Hungary if he promised not to engage in political activities. He refused the deal and remained in the USSR where he died in Gorky in 1971. After his death, his ashes were privately returned to Hungary for burial in the Farkasréti Cemetery in Budapest. Only his initials are visible on his gravestone to avoid vandalism.

<text>The Oldsmobile Silhouette is a minivan manufactured by General Motors for model years 1990–2004 over two generations.

Production ended when General Motors discontinued its Oldsmobile brand in 2004. GM continued to market badge-engineered variants of the U-body minivans, the Saturn Relay and the Buick Terraza from model years 2005 to 2007.


==Background==
General Motors&#x27; first attempt at producing a minivan to compete with the Chrysler minivans—the rear-wheel-drive, truck-based Chevrolet Astro and its twin, the GMC Safari—failed to compete strongly against Chrysler&#x27;s dominance in the minivan market in the 1980s. The 1990 Oldsmobile Silhouette and its sibling models sold more successfully than the Astro/Safari predecessors.

First shown to the public in 1986, the Pontiac Trans Sport concept car featured futuristic styling, individually removable bucket seats with built-in stereo speakers, a gull-wing rear passenger door and extensive use of glass including a glass-paneled roof.

The Trans Sport was approved for production without the gullwing door and the glass roof. Chevrolet and Oldsmobile received production vehicles based on the Trans Sport with the Lumina APV and Silhouette respectively. While the Pontiac Trans Sport was targeted at sport- and style-oriented buyers, the Lumina was the value offering and the Silhouette targeted premium markets, competing with the Chrysler Town &amp; Country.

==First generation (1990–1996)==

The first 1990 Oldsmobile Silhouette was manufactured on August 1, 1989. Assembled in General Motors&#x27; North Tarrytown Assembly assembly facility, these U platform vans consisted of a galvanized steel space frame wrapped in composite plastic body panels that were impervious to rust and minor dents and dings, a manufacturing technique developed on the Pontiac Fiero and also used extensively on General Motors&#x27; Saturn line of vehicles.

The Silhouette was available with seating for seven, with the five lightweight () rear seats being individually reconfigurable and removable. In 1994, built-in child seats were added to the option list, which provided the ability to switch two of the rear seats between adult and child seating with the pull of a seat-mounted tab.

Included with the level ride package, which utilized a compressor and air-pressurized rear shock absorbers to maintain vehicle height regardless of load, was a control panel and air hose kit that allowed the vehicle to be used to inflate tires, air mattresses, and sporting equipment.

In 1994, a remote-controlled power sliding door feature was added, a General Motors innovation.

For the 1994 and 1995 model years, traction control was available with the 3800 engine option.

The first-generation Silhouette was not available in Canada.

===European Market===

Europeans grew accustomed to sleek minivans thanks to the Renault Espace and did not object to the futuristic styling. For the European market, however, the Oldsmobile Silhouette was sold as the Pontiac Trans Sport by replacing the Oldsmobile badging with Pontiac badging, along with Pontiac wheels. Sales in Europe were good for an American import, but did not represent enough volume to make a fourth, distinct model economically feasible. Like the Oldsmobile Silhouette, the European Trans Sport did not receive any facelift, as the vans&#x27; initial styling had not been negatively received there.

The Pontiac Trans Sport of Europe was discontinued in 1997. Its successors were both the Chevrolet Trans Sport (a rebadged second-generation Pontiac Trans Sport) (LWB), and the Opel Sintra (SWB). In the United Kingdom, it was sold as the Vauxhall Sintra.

===Engines===
* 1990–1995 LG6 3.1 () V6
* 1992–1995 3800 () V6 (optional)
* 1996 LA1 3400 () V6

===Modest sales success===
The Oldsmobile Silhouette and its siblings were controversial because they were the first minivans to be marketed as stylish or sporty. While they were lower and sleeker than the competition, the large, long, and sloped windshield made for a disconcerting driving experience until the driver adjusted to the &quot;different&quot; proportions. Automotive magazines dubbed these minivans &quot;dustbusters&quot; after a similar-looking household appliance.

The first engine in these vans was a meager 3.1 L V6, that produced only , which was not up to the task of hauling these fairly heavy vehicles.

In 1992, the Silhouette and its siblings received the 3.8 L 3800 V6 as an option, which provided better torque and acceleration, making them the most powerful as well as best handling minivans then in production.

Production of the first-generation Silhouette and its stablemates ended on June 26, 1996, at which time the Tarrytown, New York, plant which produced them and which had been in operation since 1900, was shuttered and scheduled for demolition.

===Year to year changes===
===1990===
* All-new model. The Silhouette, in keeping with its positioning as GM&#x27;s luxury minivan offering, is available with optional leather seating, a feature not available on its platform mates and available only on the Chrysler Town and Country among competing manufacturers&#x27; models.

===1991===
* Black carpeting was added to the dashboard in the place of the more reflective plastic to address customer complaints about glare from the windshield.

===1992===
* Newly available for 1992 was GM&#x27;s 3800 V6 engine coupled with a Hydra-Matic 4T60-E 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission.
* The cowl-mounted fixed radio antenna was eliminated, and an integrated roof antenna was installed, sandwiched between the roof and the headliner.
* Side-view mirrors were changed to the folding type, and were enlarged to provide better rear visibility.
* Brakes were enlarged and anti-lock brakes (ABS) were added as standard equipment.
* A pop-up sunroof was added to the options list.
* Steering-wheel mounted controls for the stereo system were added as an option.

===1993===
* The Silhouette&#x27;s exterior is facelifted, sporting wrap-around turn signal/parking lamps in front, along with standard foglamps.
* Tail lights&#x27; design is changed from a grid to a solid red color with black &quot;dissolves&quot; around the edges, a style that had been previously used exclusively on the Pontiac Trans Sport.
* A remote-controlled power sliding side door was announced for 1993, but was never made into production.
* The center console was redesigned with larger climate controls, a large storage cubby, and a large storage bin at its base.

===1994===
* In an effort to lessen the perceived distance to the base of the windshield, a ridge was added to the interior dash finishing panel.
* A remote-controlled power sliding door became available as an option a year after the announcement.
* Built-in child seats for the second row became available as an option.
* A traction control system became available as an option.
* Rear deep-tinted windows now featured a darker tint than previously used.
* A driver-side airbag became standard equipment.
* A roof rack became standard on all Silhouettes and their subsequent model years, but remained optional on the Chevrolet and Pontiac.
* A third brake light was added, as mandated on light trucks for the 1994 model year.

===1995===
* Automatic power door locks that engaged/disengaged with the transmission shifting into or out of &quot;park&quot; added as a standard feature of the power door lock option package.

===1996===
* Final year of production. Replaced in 1997 by an all-new design carrying the same name.
* Both 3.1 and 3.8 L V6 engines were dropped, the 3.4 L 3400 V6 engine became the only engine available.
* Traction control dropped as an option.
* Air conditioning and movable rear seats are now standard.

==Second generation (1997–2004)==

The redesigned 1997 Silhouette was built at Doraville Assembly like other U-body based minivans. Canadian sales began as a 1998 model. The first Silhouettes were assembled in August 1996.

Having achieved second place in sales to Chrysler, General Motors brought out an entirely new U platform series of minivans, theoretically based on the lessons learned from its previous missteps. Reeling from the criticisms of the previous &quot;dustbuster&quot; minivans, the new Silhouette would be completely redesigned as conventional in all respects. The vehicle consisted of steel unibody construction, and the styling would be as conservative as possible. The previous generation was also a little too large for comfortably navigating European streets, so this new range of models would be narrower and slightly smaller than was the norm for the United States in order to produce a single range of minivans that GM hoped would fill the needs of both the North American and European markets. At this time, GM continued to offer the Silhouette as their premium luxurious minivan, while the Trans Sport/Montana and the Venture were offered as the mid-ranged sporty and basic value-oriented versions respectively.

During the development of this generation of the U-body minivan, General Motors extensively benchmarked the then current Chrysler minivans. The resultant vehicles more closely resembled the immensely successful trio of Chrysler minivans; However, Chrysler would launch a completely redesigned minivan line a year before GM.

Two different wheelbase lengths were offered as well as dual sliding doors. The base model (only offered for 1997) was the only model to offer short-wheelbase and a driver side sliding door being only optional, when all the other trim levels of the Silhouette were in long-wheelbase extended version and offered a standard driver side sliding door.

Unlike with the Venture and Trans Sport/Montana, the roof rack was standard on all Silhouettes. New for this generation were cabin air filters, and the filters can be accessed from behind an access panel easily accessed from inside the glove compartment.

Silhouettes, in keeping with their luxury positioning, offered many features as standard that were optional on competing makes and on its platform mates. In 1998, it became one of the first vehicles on the market to offer a DVD player with overhead retractable LCD screen for back seat viewing, which has since become a &quot;must-have&quot; option for families with children. For 2001, the Silhouette received a minor facelift that included a new grille and front bumper.

===Trim levels===
* Base (1997)
* &quot;GL&quot; (1997–2004) – Included: Cloth upholstery, 15&quot; steel rims with hubcaps, air conditioning, map pockets in driver and passenger seats, power driver&#x27;s seat, storage drawer under passenger front seat, an AM/FM stereo with single-CD player and seek-scan tuning, coaxial speakers, and clock, overhead console, fog lamps, and power front windows with automatic driver&#x27;s side window. Later standard features were an AM/FM stereo with single-CD and cassette players and speed-compensated volume control, TheftLock, and clock, a garage door opener, rear seat audio controls, keyless entry, heated power mirrors, and automatic headlamps.
* &quot;GLS&quot; (1997–2004) – Added: leather upholstery, rear parking aid, tri-zone climate control system, rear seat audio/climate controls, compass, garage door opener, an AM/FM stereo with single-CD and cassette players, seek-scan tuning, coaxial speakers and clock, leather wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, power front seats with driver&#x27;s side memory, 16-inch alloy rims, and power sliding passenger door.
* &quot;GS&quot; (1998–1999)
* &quot;Premiere&quot; (1998–2004) – Added: Entertainment system with DVD player with fold-down overhead color monitor for rear passengers, input jacks for video games or camcorders, 4 pairs of wireless headphones and rear seat visual/audio controls, heated front seats, and power sliding driver&#x27;s side door.

===Engine===
The engine was a 3.4 L LA1 3400 () V6 engine that was shared with the Chevrolet Venture and the Pontiac Trans Sport/Montana.

===Safety criticism===
In 1996, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tested a 1997 Pontiac Trans Sport among other minivans of the time. The minivan suffered extreme damage to the vehicle in the moderate overlap crash test, which has resulted in some criticism by contemporary reviewers. The minivan received a &quot;Poor&quot; rating and was ranked as the &quot;Worst Performing Vehicle&quot; by the institute as a result. This status was also applied to the Chevrolet Venture and the Oldsmobile Silhouette as they both use the same chassis and body design, including the later first-generation Pontiac Montana.

Some comments made by the IIHS after the first test in 1996 were:
* Major collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver.
* Extreme steering wheel movement snapped the dummy&#x27;s head backward.
* The unnatural position of the dummy&#x27;s left foot indicates that an occupant&#x27;s left leg would have been seriously injured in a real-world crash of this severity.
* The forces on the left lower leg were so high that the dummy&#x27;s metal foot broke off at the ankle.

In a semi-related event, the European equivalent of the Silhouette, the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra, also fared badly in Euro NCAP&#x27;s frontal impact crash test on a 1998 model year minivan, made worse by the steering wheel (and airbag) breaking off from the dashboard (a phenomenon that was not present in the IIHS test). Despite performing well in the side impact test, it rated 2.5 stars as a result.

The safety issues of the Silhouette and its U-body siblings were later addressed with the third-generation redesign (consisting of the Montana SV6 and the related Uplander, Terraza and Relay models), which earned the highest rating of &quot;Good&quot; given by the institute in the moderate overlap crash test.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the van 4 stars for driver protection and 3 stars for passenger protection in the frontal impact test. In the side impact test, it received 5 stars for front passenger protection, and 5 stars rear passenger protection. This applies to all other second-generation U-body minivans.

===Mixed sales success===
The Silhouette and its platform mates achieved slightly better sales than their avant-garde predecessors, but also failed to capture a significant share of the market. While the Silhouette was a close competitor in many of the key categories, it was also a winner in luxury, as it was one of the first minivans to offer a factory video entertainment system.

The minivan market had become significantly more crowded with competing products that proved to be more desirable, and throughout the Silhouette&#x27;s production, it was widely considered a second-tier competitor, certainly competent but not a stand-out in any category.

The Silhouette remained in production until the 2004 model year with minimal changes. As Oldsmobile itself was gradually phased out with slowing sales, a limited run of 500 units, dubbed Final 500, of each of the brand&#x27;s five remaining models were built and sold. The Silhouette received the Final 500 edition as well, applied exclusively to the Premiere trim. It featured a Dark Cherry Metallic paint, like the Alero, Bravada, Aurora, and Intrigue, custom vintage Oldsmobile badging on the front fenders and rear liftgate, Final 500 embroidered seat backs for the front and middle row (unique to the Final 500 Silhouettes) and front floor mats, and Aurora-styled chrome wheels. However, as production capacity was constrained by fleet order obligations of its siblings, only 360 out of the 500 Silhouettes were built. Production of the Silhouette ended on March 31, 2004.

===Successors and decline===
The spiritual successor to the Oldsmobile Silhouette within the General Motors lineup is the Buick Terraza (2005–2007), which was built on an updated version of the U platform and occupied the luxury minivan slot previously occupied by the Silhouette.

However, due to poor sales of all the third-generation GM minivans in the United States, GM decided to exit the minivan market altogether in that region. Production of the Pontiac Montana SV6 ended after the 2006 model year in the United States, the Buick Terraza and Saturn Relay ended after the 2007 model year, and for the Chevrolet Uplander, production ceased in the United States after the 2008 model year and focused on the new crossover vehicle market. However, production of the Uplander and Montana SV6 continued in Mexico and Canada until 2009 since they were still fairly popular in those countries.

===One-Off Variants===

* Silhouette OSV (1999) – A modified version of the Silhouette that was created as part of &quot;Oldsmobile Specialty Vehicles&quot;, an experiment in an aftermarket tuning brand for Oldsmobile. It debuted at the 1999 SEMA show alongside the OSV Alero and OSV Intrigue. It features: 3.4L SFI V6 engine with tuned intake and headers that produces 210 hp @ 4400rpm, 270 lb-ft torque @ 2800rpm, 4-speed Hydramatic 4T60-E automatic transmission, RH Evolution C6 wheels, 13-inch Brembo cross-drilled 4-wheel disc brakes, Koni struts and springs, front and rear spoilers, ground effects package, K&amp;N filtration, and Borla exhaust. On the exterior, the OSV Silhouette features a ground effects package similar to its OSV siblings, Candy Apple Red paint with ghosted Oldsmobile Tilted Rocket logos on the rear quarter panels, an OSV badge between the wheel wells and front doors, and silver inserts that block out the minivan&#x27;s twin grille. Inside, the OSV is largely the same as its OSV siblings, sporting climate-controlled, 8-position Recaro Style seats, trimmed in neutral and red leather, and Titanium pedals. Unique to the OSV Silhouette is the fact that all of its seats are Recaro Style seats. All the headrests of the seats have the OSV logo embroidered into the headrests, like the OSV Alero and OSV Intrigue. It was sold in 2009 at the Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction, and again in 2012. In December 2020, an article by Hagerty reported that the OSV Silhouette was found listed for sale at Empire Motors in Canada. According the article, three OSV Silhouettes were built. The OSV Silhouette featured in the article has since been sold.
* Silhouette OSV II (2000) – Another Silhouette modified for OSV, this time painted dark green. Little information exists on the Silhouette OSV II, but it appears largely the same as the Silhouette OSV I. It is part of a second batch of OSVs alongside the Alero OSV II and Intrigue OSV II. Like the other OSV II models, the whereabouts of the Silhouette OSV II are unknown.

<text>No. 101 Squadron of the Royal Air Force operates the Airbus Voyager in the air-to-air refuelling and transport roles from RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
101 Squadron RFC was formed at Farnborough on 12 July 1917 operating the Royal Aircraft Factory FE2b. Two weeks later it moved to France to operate as a night bomber squadron. In March 1919 the squadron returned to the UK and it was disbanded on 31 December 1919.

===Reformation and World War II===
The squadron was reformed in March 1928 at RAF Bircham Newton as a day bomber squadron flying the Boulton Paul Sidestrand. In 1938 the squadron was equipped with the Bristol Blenheim. In 1941 the squadron changed to a medium-bomber squadron with the Vickers Wellington. These were replaced the following year with the Avro Lancaster. 101 Squadron Lancasters were in 1943 equipped with a top secret radio jamming system codenamed &quot;Airborne Cigar&quot; (ABC) operated by an eighth crew member who could understand German, some with German or Jewish backgrounds known as &quot;special operators&quot; commonly abbreviated to &quot;spec ops&quot; or &quot;SO&quot;. They sat in a curtained off area towards the rear of the aircraft and located and jammed German fighter controller&#x27;s broadcasts, occasionally posing as controllers to spread disinformation. The aircraft fitted with the system were distinctive due to the two large vertical antennae rising from the middle of the fuselage. Deliberately breaking the standing operating procedure of radio silence to conduct the jamming made the aircraft highly vulnerable to being tracked and attacked, which resulted in 101 Squadron having the highest casualty rate of any RAF squadron.

===Post-war===
In October 1945, the squadron moved to RAF Binbrook, Lincolnshire and in June 1946 re-equipped with Avro Lincolns. These aircraft were deployed in conducting small-scale raids against the Quteibi tribe at Thumier in Aden in October 1947.

On 25 May 1950, the squadron took delivery of its first English Electric Canberra B2 thereby becoming the RAF’s first jet bomber unit. Without a training unit in existence, conversion to type was achieved by the squadron itself with assistance from English Electric test pilots. Most of the type’s service trials were flown by the squadron and, by the end of 1950, nine Canberra B2s were held on strength. Out of the pool of type-qualified crews, a wing of five squadrons had been formed by August 1952 at Binbrook, comprising Nos. 9, 12, 50, 101 and 617.

In June 1954, the squadron became the first to receive the B.6 variant of the Canberra. After full conversion to the type, the Binbrook Wing of five squadrons undertook an intensive training programme in readiness for staged detachments to Malaya as support for Operation Firedog. This was a large-scale counter-insurgency campaign, on-going in Malaya since 1948 against communist guerrillas.
101 Squadron became the first RAF jet bomber squadron to serve in the Far East when four Canberras arrived at Changi on 11 February 1955. The first bomb drop by an RAF jet bomber occurred when the squadron, which had been deployed to RAF Butterworth, Penang, was operating against a target in Johore. Over a period of two months operating from Butterworth, ninety-eight raids were made before the squadron returned to Binbrook on 21 June 1955. A final deployment to the same base from June to August 1956 signified the last Canberra participation in the Malayan operation. Also in 1956, the squadron flew night bombing raids against Egyptian airfields from their base at Hal Far, Malta during the Suez crisis. With the entry into service of the V bombers, Canberras in the bomber role were becoming outmoded. Consequently, 101 Squadron was temporarily disbanded on 1 February 1957.

===Vulcans===

The squadron reformed on 15 October 1957 as part of RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s V bomber force maintaining the UK&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent, equipped with Avro Vulcan B1s from RAF Finningley, and in 1961 the squadron moved from Finningley to RAF Waddington where it remained until disbandment in 1982. Its aircraft were now the upgraded Vulcan B1A fitted with the ECM tailpod. The squadron&#x27;s assigned role was high-level strategic bombing with a variety of free fall nuclear bombs. These included American bombs supplied to the RAF under Project E.

On 20 June 1961 a 101 Squadron Vulcan B1A (XH481) flew non-stop from RAF Waddington to the Royal Australian Air Force Base Richmond, NSW, the longest recorded non-stop flight by a Vulcan, and the 10,000 nmi flight still stands as a record for the Vulcan, exceeding the mileage done by the Black Buck Vulcan by some 3,000 nmi.

After the advent of effective Soviet SAMs forced Bomber Command to reassign V bombers from high-altitude operations to low-level penetration operations in March 1963, the squadron&#x27;s Vulcans adopted a mission profile that included a &#x27;pop-up&#x27; manoeuvre from 500–1,000 ft to above 12,000 ft for safe release of Yellow Sun Mk2.

By Dec 1967 the squadron was re-equipped with eight Vulcan B2 aircraft and eight WE.177B laydown bombs which 
improved aircraft survivability by enabling aircraft to remain at low-level during weapon release. 

Following the transfer of responsibility for the nuclear deterrent to the Royal Navy the squadron was reassigned to SACEUR for tactical strike missions still armed with the WE.177B bomb and a variety of conventional munitions. In a high-intensity European war the squadron&#x27;s new role was to support land forces on the Continent resisting an assault on Western Europe by the Red Army, by striking deep into enemy-held areas beyond the forward edge of the battlefield, striking at enemy concentrations and infrastructure, first with conventional weapons and secondly with WE.177 tactical nuclear weapons as required, should a conflict escalate to that stage. The squadron continued in this role until the Falklands War of 1982 when the squadron performed operations during the campaign in the South Atlantic, and was then disbanded on 4 August 1982.

===Tankers===
In 1978, the RAF announced a plan to convert second-hand civil Vickers VC10 aircraft for conversion to aerial refuelling aircraft and the first K2 flew in 1982. No 101 Squadron was chosen to operate the aircraft and was reformed at RAF Brize Norton on 1 May 1984. Notable recent deployments of 101 Squadron include the Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The VC10 aircraft was retired on 20 September 2013, and was replaced by the Airbus Voyager.

<doc id="847917" wikidata="Q235236" url="?curid=847917" title="Princess Ragnhild, Mrs. Lorentzen">
<text>Princess Ragnhild, Mrs Lorentzen (Ragnhild Alexandra; 9 June 1930 – 16 September 2012), was the eldest child of King Olav V of Norway and Princess Märtha of Sweden. She was the older sister of King Harald V and Princess Astrid. She was the first Norwegian royal to have been born in Norway since the Middle Ages. In 1953 she married the industrialist Erling Lorentzen, a member of the Lorentzen family of shipping magnates. In the same year they moved to Brazil, where her husband was an industrialist and a main owner of Aracruz Celulose. She lived in Brazil until her death 59 years later.

Although she was the King&#x27;s eldest child, she was never in the line of succession to the Norwegian throne, owing to Norway&#x27;s law of agnatic succession. She was in the line of succession to the British throne, and occupied the 16th and 17th place in that succession line during her childhood and youth.

==Early life==
Princess Ragnhild was the first Norwegian princess to have been born on Norwegian soil for 629 years. She grew up at the royal residence of Skaugum near Asker, west of Oslo. She was christened in the Palace Chapel on 27 June 1930 and her godparents were: her paternal grandparents, The King and Queen of Norway; her maternal grandparents, The Duke and Duchess of Västergötland; her great uncle, The King of Sweden; her great aunt, Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom; her maternal aunt, Princess Axel of Denmark; and The Duke of York.

In 1940, during World War II, she and her family fled the German invasion of Norway, and she spent the wartime years in exile with her mother and siblings in Bethesda, Maryland, located northwest of Washington, D.C. Before the birth of her younger brother, it was assumed she would accede to the throne in the absence of a male heir, although this would have required a constitutional amendment, as women could not inherit the throne at the time.

Her Confirmation took place on 11 May 1947 in the Palace Chapel.

Following the royal family&#x27;s return to Norway she attended Nissen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, obtaining her school leaving certificate in 1948. She later spent four semesters, between 1948 and 1949, studying at a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland.

==Marriage and family==

Princess Ragnhild married Erling Lorentzen, a member of the Norwegian merchant upper-class (see Lorentzen family), in Asker Church on 15 May 1953. Lorentzen was a businessman and army officer who had served as her bodyguard during the War.

Following her marriage, the couple moved to Rio de Janeiro, where her husband had substantial business holdings. Their residence in Brazil was originally temporary, but they eventually settled there, and remained in Rio until Ragnhild&#x27;s death in 2012. In Brazil, her husband founded Aracruz Celulose.

The couple had three children:

* Haakon Lorentzen (born 23 August 1954), married Martha Carvalho de Freitas (born 1958) on 14 April 1982, and had three children:
** Olav Alexander Lorentzen (born 11 July 1985), married Ingrid Kraus de Andrade Nogueira (born 1988) on 4 December 2021, and has one son:
*** Salvador Lorentzen (born 1 April 2023).
** Christian Frederik Lorentzen (born 23 May 1988) married Mariah de Oliveira Pedrosa (born 1991) on 19 March 2022, and has one son:
*** Thomas Lorentzen (born December 2022).
** Sophia Anne Lorentzen (born 28 June 1994).
* Ingeborg Lorentzen (born 27 February 1957), married Paulo César Ribeiro Filho (born 1956) on 4 June 1982, and has one daughter:
** Victoria Ragna Lorentzen Ribeiro (born 19 December 1988), married Felipe Sampaio Octaviano Falcão on 9 August 2014, and has two children:
*** Frederik Sven Lorentzen Falcão (born 28 September 2016).
*** Alice Eva Lorentzen Falcão (born 21 October 2022)
* Ragnhild Alexandra Lorentzen (born 8 May 1968), married Aaron Matthew Long on 21 November 2003, and has two daughters.
** Alexandra Joyce Lorentzen Long (born 14 December 2007).
** Elizabeth Patricia Lorentzen Long (born March 2011).

==Public life==
Princess Ragnhild opened the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway, as her father and grandfather were attending the funeral of King George VI.

A conservative, Princess Ragnhild publicly criticized her niece and nephew, Princess Märtha Louise and Crown Prince Haakon Magnus, for their choice of spouses, in 2004.

Princess Ragnhild was patron of the Norwegian Organisation for the Hearing Impaired.

Several ships, including MS &quot;Prinsesse Ragnhild&quot;, were named for her.

Although a private person, in 1995 Ragnhild decided to write her autobiography (this was penned with the help of author Lars O. Gulbrandsen) published under the title, “Mitt liv som kongsdatter” [My Life as a King’s Daughter].

==Death==
Princess Ragnhild died of lung cancer at her home in Rio de Janeiro on 16 September 2012, aged 82. Her body arrived in Oslo on 24 September 2012, where her brother King Harald V and her sister Princess Astrid were present to greet her alongside her spouse Erling and their children. The funeral of Princess Ragnhild was held on 28 September 2012 in the chapel of the Royal Palace of Oslo. She was later cremated and privately interred in the church of Asker.

==Ancestry==
She was a great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and great-granddaughter of Edward VII of the United Kingdom, thus a second cousin to Queen Elizabeth II. At the time of her birth she was 17th in the line of succession to the British throne, and 77th at the time of her death. Princess Ragnhild&#x27;s maternal aunt was Queen Astrid of Belgium, which also made Princess Ragnhild a first cousin of kings Baudouin and Albert II of Belgium and of Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. Through her maternal grandmother, Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, she was also a second cousin of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Queen Anne Marie of Greece as well as a second cousin once removed of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden through her maternal grandfather Prince Carl of Sweden.

<doc id="847918" wikidata="Q1344536" url="?curid=847918" title="Porte Maillot station">
<text>Porte Maillot () is a station on Paris Métro Line 1. It is connected to the station &quot;&quot; on the RER C and RER E, as well as a stop of tramway line T3b. The station in its current form opened in 1937, replacing the original Porte Maillot station that opened in 1900 as the original terminus of Line 1. It serves the Palais des Congrès and has exits towards Neuilly-sur-Seine. It is located close to the Bois de Boulogne.

==History==
The first station called &quot;Porte Maillot&quot; opened in 1900 and was the terminus of Line 1, and was therefore a loop, allowing trains to turn around without reversing. Like Porte Dauphine and Porte de Vincennes, it was arranged with a central waiting area and tracks on either side, with two tunnels. 

When Line 1 was extended to the west to Pont de Neuilly in 1937, the station needed to be replaced as it was at the same depth as the tunnels of the railway line today served by the RER C. Thus, the tunnel of the Line 1 extension descends and passes under the old loop, and then reaches the new station at a distance of approximately 100 meters from the old station. The platforms of the new station were built 105 metres long to accommodate 7-car trains in the future, a plan which has never been realised.

In 1992, the old station was turned into a reception area by the RATP called the &quot;Espace Maillot&quot;. It was again transformed in 1997 into a maintenance facility for the new MP 05 rolling stock.

In 1988, the RER C started serving the Neuilly – Porte Maillot station of the RER C. In 2024, an extension of RER E from to opened with a new underground station at Neuilly – Porte Maillot. The metro station is connected to the RER E station via an underground corridor, from where the RER C station can be reached via another corridor.

==Passenger services==

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
The current station is made up of two parallel stations, each of standard configuration with two platforms separated by the metro tracks under an elliptical arch. The trains run on the outer tracks, the others being used as termini or garages. The decoration is in the style used for the majority of metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s (with the exception of one on the south platform of the north station), and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are made of brown ceramic and the name of the station is inscribed in the metro&#x27;s font, Parisine, on enamelled plaques. The platforms are equipped with yellow &quot;Akiko&quot; seats, and are fully equipped with screen doors, as is the north platform of the south station (the fourth platform, bordered by a dead-end track on the east side, has façade modules only at the ends, on the spaces not covered by the trains that are parked there).
===Other connections===
The station is served by bus lines 73, 82, PC, 244 and 274 (remotely, from the Porte des Ternes stop) of the RATP Bus Network and by lines N11, N24, N151 and N153 of the Noctilien night bus service. In addition, it is at the origin of a bus link to Beauvais-Tillé Airport.

<text>Pilliga is a village 105 km west of Narrabri in the North West Plains section of the New England region of New South Wales, Australia. The village is within Narrabri Shire local government area.

It is located near the Pilliga Forest, which supports a rich assortment of bird life and a significant timber harvesting industry. At the 2016 census, Pilliga had a population of 217 people. The place name is derived from an Aboriginal word for &quot;swamp oaks&quot;. The Pilliga post office opened on 1 January 1867.

In 1902 the Pilliga artesian bore baths were constructed as a permanent town water supply. These baths have become a popular swimming and therapeutic spot for residents and visitors. The water temperature of the Pilliga bore is .

The village has a store, police station, post office and school which has about 16 enrolled pupils.

The book &quot;A Million Wild Acres&quot; by Eric Rolls, is an acclaimed environmental history of the Pilliga Scrub.

Another point of dubious interest relevant to the area, is the frequent, apparent sightings of the mythical Yowie.

<doc id="847925" wikidata="Q383481" url="?curid=847925" title="Phenocryst">
<text>A phenocryst is an early forming, relatively large and usually conspicuous crystal distinctly larger than the grains of the rock groundmass of an igneous rock. Such rocks that have a distinct difference in the size of the crystals are called porphyries, and the adjective porphyritic is used to describe them. Phenocrysts often have euhedral forms, either due to early growth within a magma, or by post-emplacement recrystallization. Normally the term &quot;phenocryst&quot; is not used unless the crystals are directly observable, which is sometimes stated as greater than in diameter. Phenocrysts below this level, but still larger than the groundmass crystals, are termed &quot;microphenocrysts&quot;. Very large phenocrysts are termed &quot; megaphenocrysts&quot;. Some rocks contain both microphenocrysts and megaphenocrysts. In metamorphic rocks, crystals similar to phenocrysts are called porphyroblasts.

Phenocrysts are more often found in the lighter (higher silica) igneous rocks such as felsites and andesites, although they occur throughout the igneous spectrum including in the ultramafics. The largest crystals found in some pegmatites are often phenocrysts being significantly larger than the other minerals.

==Classification by phenocryst==

Rocks can be classified according to the nature, size and abundance of phenocrysts, and the presence or absence of phenocrysts is often noted when a rock name is determined. &quot;Aphyric&quot; rocks are those that have no phenocrysts, or more commonly where the rock consists of less than 1% phenocrysts (by volume); while the adjective &quot;phyric&quot; is sometimes used instead of the term &quot;porphyritic&quot; to indicate the presence of phenocrysts. Porphyritic rocks are often named using mineral name modifiers, normally in decreasing order of abundance. Thus when olivine forms the primary phenocrysts in a basalt, the name may be refined from &quot;basalt&quot; to &quot;porphyritic olivine basalt&quot; or &quot;olivine phyric basalt&quot;. Similarly, a basalt with olivine as the dominant phenocrysts, but with lesser amounts of plagioclase phenocrysts, might be termed an &quot;olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt&quot;.

In more complex nomenclature, a basalt with approximately 1% plagioclase phenocrysts, but 4% olivine microphenocrysts, might be termed an &quot;aphyric to sparsely plagioclase-olivine phyric basalt&quot;, where plagioclase is listed before the olivine because of its larger crystals. Categorizing a rock as aphyric or as sparsely phyric is often a question of whether a significant number of crystals exceed the minimum size.

==Analysis using phenocrysts==
Geologists use phenocrysts to help determine rock origins and transformations because crystal formation partly depends on pressure and temperature. 

===Other characteristics===
Plagioclase phenocrysts often exhibit zoning with a more calcic core surrounded by progressively more sodic rinds. This zoning reflects the change in magma composition as crystallization progresses. This is described as normal zoning if the rim of the crystal shows a lower-temperature composition than the core of the crystal. Reverse zoning describes the more unusual case where the rim shows a higher-temperature composition than the core. Oscillatory zoning shows period fluctuations between low- and high-temperature compositions.

In rapakivi granites, phenocrysts of orthoclase are enveloped within &quot;rinds&quot; of sodic plagioclase such as oligoclase. 

In shallow intrusives or volcanic flows phenocrysts which formed before eruption or shallow emplacement are surrounded by a fine-grained to glassy matrix. These volcanic phenocrysts often show flow banding, a parallel arrangement of lath-shaped crystals. These characteristics provide clues to the rocks&#x27; origins. Similarly, intragranular microfractures and any intergrowth among crystals provide additional clues.

<text>Christopher John Bradshaw (May 20, 1944 – November 3, 2018) was a Canadian politician and businessman. He served as interim leader of the Green Party of Canada from 2001 to 2003, and sought public office as a candidate of the Green Party of Canada and the Green Party of Ontario.

==Business==
Bradshaw has a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science, and worked for General Motors of Canada following his graduation. He subsequently moved to Ottawa, Ontario, where he worked in a low-income community with the Company of Young Canadians, then as executive director of the CMHC-funded Canadian Organization of Public Housing Tenants, and then for 22 years as community relations specialist for the Planning Department of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton, retiring in 1995. He then co-founded Vrtucar, a car-sharing service in Ottawa, in May 2000, but sold his share to his partner in late 2006. The company continues to grow.

==Advocacy==
In 1988, he started Ottawalk, the first pedestrian advocacy group in the continent. He was recognized by America Walks in 2001 as the &quot;father of pedestrian advocacy in North America.&quot;

==Politics==
In February 2001, Bradshaw was appointed interim leader of the federal Green Party, via election by the board. Bradshaw helped organize the 2003 Green Party Leadership Convention in Ottawa, and was responsible for moving the party&#x27;s central office to Ottawa from Toronto. In February 2003, he was succeeded as party leader by Jim Harris. At the 2002 national convention in Montreal, he was elected leader, with the understanding that the post would be filled on a more permanent basis in early 2003 via mail-in ballots.

Bradshaw ran for public office in the Ontario provincial election of 1999, receiving 1,231 votes in Ottawa Centre. In the 2003 election, he finished fourth with 3,821 votes (7.75%) in the same riding, the highest vote percentage of any Green Party candidate in the province.

Federally, Bradshaw first ran for office in the general election of 2000. Again campaigning in Ottawa Centre, he received 1529 votes for a fifth-place finish. In 2002, while serving as party leader, he contested a by-election in Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, Newfoundland but received only 139 votes. Bradshaw ran in Newfoundland in an effort to foster a genuinely national party: there has been a history of division between the Terra Nova Green Party, which is the Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Green Party Association, and the federal Green Party.

In the 2004 federal election, Bradshaw campaigned in the rural St. Lawrence Valley riding of Leeds—Grenville, replacing Jerry Heath who unexpectedly declined to run. Despite the last-minute substitution, Bradshaw received 5.5% of the votes cast (2,722), a significant improvement over the Green Party&#x27;s previous 1.73%.

<doc id="847931" wikidata="Q89550" url="?curid=847931" title="Fritz Hochwälder">
<text>Fritz Hochwälder (28 May 1911 – 21 October 1986) also known as Fritz Hochwaelder, was an Austrian playwright. Known for his spare prose and strong moralist themes, Hochwälder won several literary awards, including the Grand Austrian State Prize for Literature in 1966. Most of his plays were first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna.

==Biography==
Born in Vienna, Austria, Hochwälder wrote social and political dramas, using historical themes in his plays. One of his earlier works &quot;Das Heilige Experiment&quot; (1942; adapted for the screen in 1959: The Strong Are Lonely) drew on the violent dismantling of a utopian Jesuit settlement by the Spaniards in Paraguay in the 1760s and &quot;Der öffentliche Ankläger&quot; (The Public Prosecutor, 1948) delved into the violence of the French Revolution. The theme of violence was a major factor in his own life—in fact, without the Nazi rise to power, Hochwälder may not have become a successful playwright.

Before the beginning of World War II, Hochwälder worked as a craftsman (an upholsterer&#x27;s apprentice) in Vienna. In 1938, Hochwälder escaped Austria and the Nazis by entering Switzerland illegally. He escaped after waiting futilely for an entry visa from any country and in this way his experiences reinforced the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann&#x27;s ironic quip that in those days the world was divided into two kinds of countries: countries that wanted to be rid of Jews and those that refused to accept them. (Hochwälder&#x27;s parents were both murdered in Theresienstadt concentration camp in the Czech Republic.)

After entering Switzerland, Hochwälder spent some time in internment camps. As he was barred by the Swiss from working in his profession, he began in earnest to write plays (he had also written plays in pre-war Vienna without much critical success).

After he left the camps, he lived in Zurich where he met and was influenced by Georg Kaiser, another exiled playwright. Kaiser was his senior by several decades and also wrote tightly constructed plays with psychological underpinnings and a strong moralist stance. Hochwälder&#x27;s 1945 play &quot;Der Flüchtling&quot; (The Refugee) was attributed by the author to a suggestion from the German dramatist.

Martin Esslin, the renowned drama professor and theater critic, wrote in the introduction to &quot;The Public Prosecutor and Other Plays&quot;: &quot;No one who has come into contact with Hochwälder&#x27;s dramatic work, no one who has been privileged to meet him in person, can fail to be impressed by the integrity, the sheer straightforward commitment to the highest value of decency and civilization that are the hallmarks of the writer and craftsman as well as the man.&quot;

Esslin, who translated some of Hochwälder&#x27;s plays into English, also commented on the juxtaposition of violent themes with a humanistic message. &quot;Again and again the message that his plays leave with the attentive reader and spectator is one of the humanity, forgiveness, reconciliation, and a refusal to fall into the trap set by the violent to the nonviolent, of converting them to their own methods.&quot;

Esslin, who coined the term &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;, may well have found compelling Hochwälder&#x27;s often paradoxical plot twists. For example, &quot;Der Himbeerpflücker&quot; (The Raspberry Picker, 1965) shows how the leaders of an Austrian town mistake a small town crook for a Nazi war criminal and treat him as a returning hero. This play was undoubtedly a homage to Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, but Hochwälder was able to put his own historical spin and moral message on the saga of mistaken identity.

Although Hochwälder spent most of his life after the war in Switzerland, he was buried in Vienna.

<text>Steven Lawrence Whitmire (born September 24, 1959) is an American puppeteer and voice actor, known primarily for his work on &quot;The Muppets&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Beginning his involvement with the Muppets in 1978, Whitmire inherited the roles of Ernie and Kermit the Frog after Jim Henson&#x27;s death in 1990; he performed the characters until 2014 and 2016, respectively. As part of the Muppet cast, he has appeared in multiple feature films and television series, performing a variety of characters on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; and during such occupations has been employed by The Jim Henson Company, Sesame Workshop, and The Muppets Studio.

==Career==
Whitmire first appeared (unpaid) at a pre-show event at Six Flags Over Georgia. He performed with his then alter-ego puppet Otis for the children waiting to see a multimedia show.

Before graduating high school, Whitmire had his first &quot;professional&quot; puppeteering job using Otis at &quot;The World of Sid &amp; Marty Krofft&quot; in Atlanta, the first indoor theme park. From there Whitmire appeared on local Atlanta TV live for 2 1/2 hours every day on &quot;The Kids Show with Otis&quot; taking telephone calls from children and adults. The show received more than 2000 calls per hour. WATL was owned at that time by former Atlanta children&#x27;s television host &quot;Officer Don&quot; Kennedy. Otis made appearances on various WATL 36 shows with Atlanta&#x27;s Ludlow Porch, performing with the Georgia Bulldogs&#x27; Larry Munson, Don Kennedy, and Entertainment Page host Artie Goodman. As Otis, Whitmire interviewed Olivia Newton-John during a tour promoting an album.

He worked with puppets after graduating high school, and eventually got a job working on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1978. Since then, Whitmire performed in almost every major Henson company project, including non-Muppet projects such as &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, and &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;.

===Characters performed===

Whitmire was the second performer of two signature Muppets—Kermit the Frog and Ernie—after the death of their creator and original performer Jim Henson (with whom he shared a birthday) in 1990. Whitmire was personally asked by Brian Henson and Jane Henson to be Kermit&#x27;s performer a few weeks after Jim Henson&#x27;s death. Heather Henson arranged for a Kermit puppet to be sent to Whitmire&#x27;s residence; however, Whitmire hid the puppet away for weeks before deciding on taking on the role. Following Richard Hunt&#x27;s death and Jerry Nelson&#x27;s retirement, Whitmire took over the roles of Beaker and Statler, respectively. In 2014, Billy Barkhurst took over the role of Ernie, with Peter Linz taking over that role in 2017.

Muppet characters original to Whitmire include Rizzo the Rat, Lips (the trumpet player from Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem), Miss Piggy&#x27;s dog Foo-Foo, Wembley Fraggle and Sprocket the Dog on &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, and Bean Bunny, a character that originated in &quot;The Tale of the Bunny Picnic&quot; (1986).

Whitmire voiced Link Hogthrob in the &quot;Muppet RaceMania&quot; and &quot;Muppets Party Cruise&quot; video games. He also performed Link for the 2011 film &quot;The Muppets&quot;. This was the first speaking appearance of the character since the death of Jim Henson, the original performer of Link. He also performed him in &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;. In 2008, Whitmire took over another of Jim Henson&#x27;s roles, The Muppet Newsman.
===Dismissal from the Muppets===

In July 2017, The Muppets Studio announced that Whitmire was no longer involved with the Muppets and that fellow Muppet performer Matt Vogel was cast as Kermit&#x27;s new performer. Whitmire stated that he was dismissed from his roles in October 2016 because of undisclosed issues that he said had not been discussed before his dismissal. In their decision-making, The Muppets Studio&#x27;s parent company Disney consulted the Henson family, who supported the recasting of Kermit and Whitmire&#x27;s dismissal.

Brian Henson stated that issues with Whitmire began in the mid-1990s, and said that Whitmire would make &quot;outrageous demands and often played brinkmanship&quot;, mentioning that &quot;Steve would use &#x27;I am now Kermit and if you want the Muppets, you better make me happy because the Muppets are Kermit.&#x27; And that is really not OK.&quot; He additionally stated that Whitmire would &quot;send emails and letters attacking everyone, attacking the writing and attacking the director&quot;. He also expressed guilt for not dismissing Whitmire and recasting Kermit before selling the Muppets to Disney in 2004, &quot;because I knew that it was going to be a real problem&quot;. Lisa Henson stated that Whitmire was opposed to having an understudy for Kermit and refused to train one, which became problematic when it came to &quot;B-level performances, such as a ribbon-cutting,&quot; at some of which she said he was unwilling to appear. She also stated that he &quot;blackballed young performers&quot; by refusing to appear in shows with them.

In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that same month, Whitmire stated he was dismissed for disagreements over Kermit&#x27;s characterization and prolonged labor union negotiations between Disney and SAG-AFTRA (of which Whitmire is a member) that delayed his involvement in Muppet productions. Whitmire alleged that Disney offered him what he called &quot;consolation prizes&quot; if he voluntarily left, including honoring him as a Disney Legend, under the public pretense that he would be retiring from performing. In a statement released to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Debbie McClellan, then-head of The Muppets Studio, said that they &quot;raised concerns about Steve’s repeated unacceptable business conduct over a period of many years, and he consistently failed to address the feedback&quot;. Whitmire has expressed an interest in making amends and resuming his role with the Muppets in the future if possible.

==Personal life==
In June 1978, Whitmire married his wife Melissa. They met during his senior year at Berkmar High School in Lilburn, Georgia. They live in Atlanta, Georgia.

<doc id="847939" wikidata="Q1439394" url="?curid=847939" title="Fossa (planetary nomenclature)">
<text>In planetary nomenclature, a fossa (pl. fossae ) is a long, narrow depression (trough) on the surface of an extraterrestrial body, such as a planet or moon. The term, which means &quot;ditch&quot; or &quot;trench&quot; in Latin, is not a geological term as such but a descriptor term used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for topographic features whose geology or geomorphology is uncertain due to lack of data or knowledge of the exact processes that formed them. Fossae are believed to be the result of a number of geological processes, such as faulting or subsidence. Many fossae on Mars are probably graben.

==On Mars==

The Tharsis quadrangle is home to large troughs (long narrow depressions) called fossae in the geographical language used for Mars. This term is derived from Latin; therefore fossa is singular and fossae is plural. Troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Studies have shown that the volcanoes of Tharsis caused most of the major fossae on Mars. The stress that caused the fossae and other tectonic features is centered in Noctis Labyrinthus, at 4 S and 253 E. But the center has moved somewhat over time. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes. A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben. Lake George, in northern New York State, is a lake that sits in a graben. Sometimes, a line of pits form as material collapse into a void that results from the stretching. Pit craters do not have rims or ejecta around them, like impact craters do. Studies have found that on Mars a fault may be as deep as 5 km, that is the break in the rock goes down to 5 km. Moreover, the crack or fault sometimes widens or dilates. This widening causes a void to form with a relatively high volume. When material slides into the void, a pit crater or a pit crater chain forms. On Mars, individual pit craters can join to form chains or even to form troughs that are sometimes scalloped. Other ideas have been suggested for the formation of fossae and pit craters. There is evidence that they are associated with dikes of magma. Magma might move along, under the surface, breaking the rock and more importantly melting ice. The resulting action would cause a crack to form at the surface. Dikes caused both by tectonic stretching (extension) and by dikes are found in Iceland. Pit craters are not common on Earth. Sinkholes, where the ground falls into a hole (sometimes in the middle of a town) resemble pit craters on Mars. However, on the Earth these holes are caused by limestone being dissolved thereby causing a void.

Knowledge of the locations and formation mechanisms of pit craters and fossae is important for the future colonization of Mars because they may be reservoirs of water.

<doc id="847948" wikidata="Q1984531" url="?curid=847948" title="Die by the Sword">
<text>Die by the Sword is a swordfighting action-adventure video game developed by Treyarch and published by Interplay Productions under their Tantrum Entertainment imprint on March 27, 1998. The game allows players to independently command the movement and swordfighting of their in-game avatars; running, jumping and turning with one hand, while simultaneously slashing, stabbing and parrying with the other. &quot;Die by the Sword&quot; also offered deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer play in its arena mode, where players could stage fights with up to three other players.

The expansion pack Limb from Limb was released on September 28, 1998 and added another main quest for the single-player campaign, enhanced multiplayer through a selection of significantly more creative arenas, and introduced new playable characters such as the Minotaur. A spiritual successor to &quot;Die by the Sword&quot; was released in 2000 exclusively for the Dreamcast, entitled &quot;&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game allows the player to fully control their sword arm, removing the need for pre-recorded animations and statistically based gameplay. Instead, a physically correct model is used for each avatar and each weapon, and both movement and damage are calculated through forces.

The sword arm can be controlled by using a joystick, the numeric keypad, or a mouse. For example, with the keyboard, to perform a slashing attack with the default key combination, a player would press the &#x27;4&#x27; and &#x27;6&#x27; keys on the numeric keypad in succession. This will move the weapon from extreme left to right. The &#x27;8&#x27;-&#x27;2&#x27; combination will likewise perform a top-down striking motion. Blocking is accomplished similarly, not through a separate key or state like in all other games of this genre, but instead through the simple physical principle of positioning the weapon so that it intercepts, and blocks, the enemy&#x27;s weapon. Shields operate like swords in this respect, though it is generally not possible to directly control the off-hand.

Alternatively, a player may opt to directly control his sword arm with mouse movements or a joystick to gain more subtle control. This allows a player to fluidly move his weapon in any direction instead of being limited to the eight points of a keypad. However characters featuring a weapon for either arm can only be properly controlled by keypad or by using predefined moves, due to their unorthodox movements.

A third and simpler method to using the mouse or keypad (as the mouse control can be awkward, and some laptops don&#x27;t have keypads) is the game&#x27;s &quot;arcade mode&quot;, which uses the Y, U, and I keys to block low, medium, and high, respectively, and H, J, and K keys to chop, slash medium, and slash high, respectively. Turning, jumping, and other acrobatics can be used in tandem with sword control to add velocity to the weapon, increasing its damage potential significantly.

The player can target and eliminate specific body parts. A well-placed swing to the head can in some cases behead an opponent. Strong blows to the arms and legs can sever limbs, leaving the opponent with reduced mobility, or in the case of the sword arm, no way to inflict damage. This system encourages multiple hits to a specific region on the body, thereby slowly cutting the opponent, and reducing his effectiveness. Delicate locations such as the head and neck, while difficult to strike, offer a quick conclusion to those with the appropriate finesse.

In the expansion, &quot;Limb from Limb&quot;, the player can choose to play the original quest as an Orc, Skeleton, Mantis, and other monsters.

===The Arena===
The Arena mode in &quot;Die by the Sword&quot; consists of as many as four players or AI bots fighting in an enclosed arena. With the &quot;Limb From Limb&quot; expansion installed, there are a total of nine Arena &#x27;Pits&#x27;.

===Tournament Mode===
Tournament mode allows the player to choose one of nine different fighters, and work up through different arenas with different combinations of other creatures. It ends with a final boss fight.

==Development==
Project lead Peter Akemann cited &quot;The Bilestoad&quot; as a major inspiration for &quot;Die by the Sword&quot;. Instead of motion capture, the dominant animation technique of the time, &quot;Die by the Sword&quot;″s animations were built with a physics engine that Akemann created over five years of post-graduate and doctoral work. This approach eliminated the need to use pre-recorded animations, thus enabling the player&#x27;s free-form control over the character&#x27;s sword swings.

==Reception==
The game received mildly favorable reviews, while &quot;Limb from Limb&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that the game &quot;should not be missed by anyone seeking immaculately done fantasy action. Recommended.&quot;

The game was a commercial failure, with sales of 28,603 units in the U.S. by April 1999. Interplay&#x27;s Alan Pavlish attributed the failure to the game&#x27;s control scheme and &quot;a dark period when it slipped nine months, so it lost momentum.&quot;

&quot;Die by the Sword&quot; was named as a finalist for &quot;PC Action Game of the Year&quot; during the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards; the award ultimately went to &quot;Quake II&quot;.

<text>Peredurus () is a legendary king of the Britons in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. According to Geoffrey, he was the youngest son of King Morvidus and brother of Gorbonianus, Archgallo, Elidurus, and Ingenius. He came to power in 317 BC.

Following the return of Elidurus to the kingship of Britain, Peredurus joined with his brother Ingenius and attacked their older brother. They succeeded in capturing him and locked him in a guarded tower in Trinovantum. Instead of fighting over who ruled the island, they split the island giving all land north and east of the River Humber, including Albany, to Peredurus, and all land to the south and west to Ingenius. He ruled his portion of the island for seven years then Ingenius died and he was awarded with the entire kingdom. He ruled moderately and was considered better than his brothers before him. Few remembered Elidurus locked in the tower until death finally took Peredurus. Elidurus returned once more as king following Peredurus&#x27;s death. His son Runo later became king of Britain.

<text>The Ottawa Jazz Festival is a music festival held annually in Ottawa, Canada. It showcases a wide range of jazz genres, including swing, jive, fusion jazz, hot jazz, boogie as well as diverse cultures and traditions. The festival claims to bring &quot;a wide range of Canadian and international musical greats to Canada&#x27;s capital.&quot; Additionally, it features new and emerging talent covering a spectrum from pop and rock to lush harmonies. While jazz is the core focus, the festival also includes music from genres such as such as blues, rock and indie.

Ticketed and free shows are held in various venues, including Confederation Park, Marion Dewar Plaza, the National Arts Centre and select local clubs. In previous years, the event has drawn up to 300,000 visitors and featured over 850 artists and more than 100 concerts.

==History==
The festival was established in 1980 when local musicians Bob Misener, Tony Pope and Bill Shuttleworth came together to organize a weekend of jazz music in Major&#x27;s Hill Park.
In 1989, the jazz festival relocated to what is now the location of its Main Stage at Confederation Park. In 1996, Catherine O&#x27;Grady took over as Executive Producer of the festival. Since her arrival, management has worked alongside the board of directors and a supportive community to achieve a 300% increase in audience attendance.

In 1999, Wynton Marsalis&#x27;s group, Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, helped the festival achieve a new attendance record with 8,000 people, which helped put the event on the map.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the festival. In place of the event, a virtual concert series named Tenacity was streamed to both domestic and international audiences. In August 2021, despite many pandemic-related restrictions, the festival returned for a four-day span of live and virtual concerts with over 50 artists performing. Finally, in 2022, the festival made a full in-person return with a nine-day lineup featuring artists like the Punch Brothers, Kamasi Washington, Holly Cole, Cory Wong, Cory Henry, Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, and more.

Under the direction of Catherine O&#x27;Grady, the Ottawa Jazz Festival has served as a key economic driver for Ottawa&#x27;s downtown core, leading to increased tourism and boost to local businesses each summer. Since 2009, the festival has brought in over $448 million in tourism spending.

==Programming==

The first several decades of the festival&#x27;s programming were initially shaped by Jacques Émond, and Petr Cancura took over the role in 2011. 

The festival has showcased numerous dynamic jazz artists on its stages, including Aretha Franklin, Herbie Hancock,
Buddy Guy, The Roots, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Salif Keita, Dave Brubeck, Mavis Staples, Roy Haynes, Toots Thielemans, Branford Marsalis, Béla Fleck, Kenny Werner, Stanley Jordan, Sonny Rollins, Terence Blanchard, Diana Krall, D.D. Jackson, Maynard Ferguson, Kenny Rogers and John Mayall.

==Winter Jazz Festival==
The Ottawa Winter Jazz Festival hosts shows that aim to foster an environment for creative interactions among jazz artists in the off-season.

In 2023, a two-day festival ran in February and featured performances by artists such as Sarah Neufield, Kenny Barron and Thus Owls.

==Current Stages==
* The Main Stage at Confederation Park
* The OLG Stage at Marion Dewar Plaza / Ottawa City Hall
*The Azrieli Studio at the National Arts Centre (Capacity - 300) 
*The Fourth Stage at the National Arts Centre (Capacity - 150)

<doc id="847961" wikidata="Q1411576" url="?curid=847961" title="Papa Stronsay">
<text>Papa Stronsay (; ) is a small island in Orkney, Scotland, lying north east of Stronsay. It is in size, and above sea level at its highest point. After being largely abandoned, the island was bought at the end of the 20th century by traditionalist Catholic monks of the Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer, who operate a monastery and farm there.

==Geography and geology==
The geology is middle old red sandstone.

A thin tongue of land curls west from the main part of the island, and then south to form the Point of the Graand (a local word meaning a &quot;sandbar&quot;). The island, in general, is low-lying, reaching a mere at its highest point.

There is an light beacon in the north east.

==History==
The island has the remains of two chapels and has been described as the site of the most northerly early Christian monastery ever found. St Nicholas&#x27; chapel dates from the eleventh century, and an eighth-century Pictish monastery may lie under it. The site was in a good state of repair circa 1783, but the structure was completely demolished sometime before 1795 &quot;to provide material for a barn&quot;. St Bride&#x27;s Chapel, located near to what is now the monastery, was of a similar size to St Nicholas&#x27;s. It was in ruins in 1900 and all surface trace of it had vanished by 1928. Other remains include cairns, a burnt mound, and a number of abandoned crofts.

The island is one of the &quot;Papeys&quot; or &quot;islands of the &quot;papar&quot;&quot;. Joseph Anderson noted that in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; &quot;The two Papeys, the great and the little (anciently Papey Meiri and Papey Minni), now Papa Westray and Papa Stronsay, are both mentioned in the Saga. Fordun in his enumeration of the islands, has a &#x27;Papeay tertia&#x27; [third Papey], which is not now known.&quot;

===Earl&#x27;s Knoll===
Earl&#x27;s Knoll, or Earl&#x27;s Know is the remains of a chambered cairn constructed in the Neolithic period, likely of the Orkney-Cromarty type, located at the south east overlooking the Golgotha Monastery and the island&#x27;s Bountifur pier. An excavation of the site took place in 1795 which was described as follows. 

The “two stones” at the head and foot would have been the dividers of the stalls in the original structure rather than grave stones as such.

===Death of Earl Rögnvald===
The &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; also records that Earl of Orkney Rögnvald Brusason was killed on Papa Stronsay circa 1046:


The unknown writer of the Orkneyinga saga wrote that &quot;Everyone agrees that of all the Earls of Orkney he [Rögnvald] was the most popular and gifted, and his death was mourned by many.

===Modern era===
A fertile island, it became an important centre for the curing of herring in the eighteenth century, but was abandoned in the 1970s.

==Present day==

In 1999, the island was purchased from farmer Charles Ronald Smith by the monastic community of the Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer, a traditionalist Catholic religious congregation formerly affiliated with the Society of St. Pius X. In 2008 the congregation, along with most of its members, was received into full communion with the Holy See. Monks at the Golgotha Monastery, which has a working farm, hail from as far afield as Australia, Samoa, South Africa and Poland. The ancient monastic ruins dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries mark Papa Stronsay as a holy island and the intention is to rebuild them.

A replica of the Papa Stronsay cross is positioned at the entrance of Golgotha Monastery. The original, which is believed to date from the medieval period, was found on the island in a graveyard close to St Nicholas’ Chapel around 1850. It was taken to Melsetter House on Hoy and an image of the stone was drawn for the 1856 first volume of &quot;Sculptured Stones of Scotland&quot; by John Stuart. By 1888 the stone had been lost. Described as a &quot;Greek cross with scroll terminals and rectangular base&quot; the cross is featured on the coat of arms of the monastery.

In 2001 the island had a recorded population of 10 although by 2011 there were no &quot;usual residents&quot; living there as recorded by the census. a dozen monks live there.

==Folklore==
Earl&#x27;s Know is traditionally thought to be the final resting place of Sir Patrick Spens. His burial there is related by William Edmonstoune Aytoun (1813–1865), who after his retirement as Sheriff and Lord Admiral of Orkney and Shetland edited a collection of Scottish poetry. In his forward to the ballad about Spens, Aytoun wrote:
According to folklore, some of the Papa Stronsay natives were descended from a female selkie. This was because they had horny skin on their feet and hands, and permanently smelled of fish.

<text>North Park Theological Seminary is a seminary located in the North Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. It is the sole graduate theological school of the Evangelical Covenant Church.

==History ==
In 1891, the school was founded by the Evangelical Covenant Church in Minneapolis. In 1894, the school moved to Chicago.

The seminary shares a campus with North Park University, the denomination&#x27;s liberal arts college. The seminary&#x27;s main building, Nyvall Hall, is named after David Nyvall, who was instrumental in the formation of the school and served as professor and president for many years.

Though retaining some of its Swedish roots, North Park Theological Seminary is now a multi-ethnic institution that fully supports women in ministry.

== Programs ==
The institution&#x27;s academic programs include a Master of Arts (MA) in Christian Ministry, Master of Arts in Theological Studies, Master of Arts in Christian Formation, Master of Divinity (M.Div.), Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) in Preaching, and various certificate programs.

The seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools.

<text>A cove is a tightly concentrated group of large standing stones found in Neolithic and Bronze Age England. Coves are square or rectangular in plan and seem to have served as small enclosures within other henge, stone circle or avenue features. They consist of three or four orthostats placed together to give the impression of a box. An opening between the stones, oriented south east, is also a feature.

They may have developed from the elaborate facades that fronted Neolithic long barrows, although their original function is unknown.

Examples include:

*The Longstones in Wiltshire;
*The cove at Avebury Henge in Wiltshire;
*The cove at Stanton Drew in Somerset and
*The cove at Mount Pleasant henge in Dorset

<doc id="847967" wikidata="Q323417" url="?curid=847967" title="Abraham Ribicoff">
<text>Abraham Alexander Ribicoff (April 9, 1910 – February 22, 1998) was an American Democratic Party politician from the state of Connecticut. He represented Connecticut in the United States House of Representatives and Senate and was the 80th Governor of Connecticut and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s cabinet. He was Connecticut&#x27;s first and to date only Jewish governor.

==Early life==
Born in New Britain, Connecticut, to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from Poland, Samuel Ribicoff, a factory worker, and Rose Sable Ribicoff. He graduated from New Britain Senior High School. Ribicoff&#x27;s relatively poor parents valued education and insisted that all his earnings from part-time boyhood jobs go toward his future schooling. After high school, he worked for a year at a nearby zipper factory of the G. E. Prentice Company to earn additional funds for college. Ribicoff enrolled at New York University in 1928, then transferred to the University of Chicago after the Prentice Company made him the Chicago office manager. While in Chicago, Ribicoff coped with school and work schedules and was permitted to enter the university&#x27;s law school before finishing his bachelor&#x27;s degree. Still a student, he married Ruth Siegel on June 28, 1931; they had two children. Ribicoff served as editor of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot; in his third year and received an LLB &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1933, being admitted to the Connecticut bar the same year. After practicing law in the office of a Hartford lawyer, Ribicoff set up his practice, first in Kensington and later in Hartford.

==Early political career==
Having become interested in politics, Ribicoff began as a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, serving in that body from 1938 to 1942. From 1941 to 1943, and again from 1945 to 1947, he was the judge of Hartford Police Court. During his political career, Ribicoff was a protégé of John Moran Bailey, the powerful chairman of the Democratic Party of Connecticut.

===U.S. Representative===
Ribicoff was elected as a Democrat to the 81st and 82nd Congresses, serving from 1949 to 1953. During that time, he served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, a position usually reserved for members with more seniority, and was a mostly loyal supporter of the foreign and domestic policies of President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s administration. Generally liberal in his outlook, he surprised many by opposing a $32 million appropriation for the construction of a dam in Enfield, Connecticut, arguing that the money was better spent on military needs and foreign policy initiatives such as the Marshall Plan.

In 1952, he made an unsuccessful bid for election to fill a vacancy in the United States Senate, losing to Prescott Bush.

===Governor of Connecticut===

After returning to his legal practice for two years, he ran for governor against incumbent Republican John Davis Lodge, winning the election with 49.5% and by just over three thousand votes. As governor (1955–1961), Ribicoff soon faced the challenge of rebuilding his state in the wake of devastating floods that occurred in the late summer and fall of 1955, and he successfully led bipartisan efforts to aid damaged areas. Ribicoff then successfully argued for increased state spending on schools and welfare programs. He also supported an amendment to the state constitution that enhanced the governing powers of local municipalities. Easily reelected in 1958, Ribicoff had by now become active on the national political scene. A longtime friend of Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, Ribicoff had nominated his fellow New Englander for vice president at the 1956 Democratic National Convention and was one of the first public officials to endorse Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign.

===Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare===
When Kennedy became president in 1961, he offered Ribicoff his choice of cabinet posts in the new administration. He reportedly declined the position of attorney general for fear that he might create needless controversy within the emerging Civil Rights Movement because he was Jewish, and he instead chose to be secretary of health, education, and welfare (HEW). Although he managed to secure a revision of the 1935 Social Security Act that liberalized requirements for Aid to Dependent Children, Ribicoff was unable to gain approval for the administration&#x27;s Medicare and school aid bills. Eventually, he tired of attempting to manage the department, whose very size made it, in his opinion, unmanageable.

Ribicoff reflected that he had sought out the position of HEW Secretary mainly out of concern for education and &quot;realized that the problems of health and welfare were so overriding that education was relegated to the back burner&quot; during his tenure.

==United States Senate==
He was finally elected to the United States Senate in 1962, replacing retiring incumbent Prescott Bush by defeating Republican nominee Horace Seely-Brown with 51% of the vote. He served in the Senate from January 3, 1963, until January 3, 1981.

Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded Kennedy as president when the latter was assassinated in 1963. Ribicoff supported Johnson at first but eventually turned against the Vietnam War and the president&#x27;s management of it, believing that it drained badly needed resources away from domestic programs.

Ribicoff allied with consumer advocate Ralph Nader in creating the Motor Vehicle Highway Safety Act of 1966, which created the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency was responsible for many new safety standards on cars. These standards were questionable because up until then, the emphasis had always been put on the driver. In response, Ribicoff stated that:The driver has many faults. He is negligent; he is careless; he is reckless. We understand that... I think it will be the millennium if you will ever get a situation where the millions and millions of drivers will all be perfect. They will always be making errors and making mistakes.

At the 1968 Democratic National Convention, during a speech nominating George McGovern, his senatorial colleague from South Dakota, he went off-script, saying, &quot;And with George McGovern as President of the United States, we wouldn&#x27;t have to have Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago.&quot; Many conventioneers, having been appalled by the response of the Chicago police to the ongoing anti-war demonstrations, broke into applause. Television cameras focused on the indignant reaction of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. Ribicoff spent the remaining years of his Senate career fighting for such issues as school integration, welfare and tax reform, and consumer protection.

During the 1972 Democratic National Convention, presidential nominee George McGovern offered Ribicoff the Democratic vice-presidential nomination, but he declined and it eventually went to Senator Thomas Eagleton. After Eagleton withdrew, McGovern asked Ribicoff (among others) to take Eagleton&#x27;s place. He again refused, publicly stating that he had no ambitions for higher office. McGovern eventually chose Sargent Shriver as his running mate. Later in 1972, following the death of his wife, Ribicoff married Lois Mell Mathes, who became known as &quot;Casey&quot;.

During his time in the Senate, Ribicoff was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations (94th and 95th Congresses) and its successor committee, the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs (95th and 96th Congresses).

Future U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman worked in Ribicoff&#x27;s Senate office as a summer intern and met his first wife, Betty Haas, there.

In 1978, Ribicoff&#x27;s niece Gail Rubin was shot and killed in the Coastal Road massacre in Israel by Palestinian terrorists. Ribicoff denounced her killing as &quot;an indefensible act of terrorism that deserves universal condemnation.&quot; In 1980, Ribicoff&#x27;s niece Sarai Ribicoff, a reporter for the &quot;Herald Examiner&quot;, was shot and killed during a robbery in Venice, California.

On May 3, 1979, Ribicoff announced his intention to retire at the end of his third term. President Jimmy Carter released a statement crediting Ribicoff with having &quot;compiled a distinguished career of public service that can serve as a model of decency, compassion, and ability.&quot;

==Later life==
In 1981, Ribicoff fulfilled his pledge to retire from the Senate and took a position as special counsel in the New York law firm of Kaye Scholer LLP and divided his time between homes in Cornwall Bridge, Connecticut, and Manhattan. He was co-chairman of the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.

Having suffered in his later years from the effects of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, he died in 1998 at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale in The Bronx, New York City, and is interred at Cornwall Cemetery in Cornwall, Connecticut.

<doc id="847969" wikidata="Q911777" url="?curid=847969" title="Feni (liquor)">
<text>Feni (, often misspelt as fenno or fenny) is a spiritous liquor type originating in Goa, India. The two most popular types of feni are cashew feni and coconut feni. Depending on the ingredients; however, other varieties and newer blends are also sold by distilleries. The small-batch distillation of feni has a fundamental effect on its final character, which still retains some of the delicate aromatics, congeners, and flavour elements of the juice from which it is produced.

The word &quot;feni&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;phena&quot;, in Konkani &quot;fenn&quot; (froth); thought to come from the bubbles that form when the liquor is shaken inside a bottle or poured into a glass. It is generally accepted that coconut feni was produced before it, and feni followed the same process until distillation was introduced by Europeans. Coconut palms are abundant along the western coastline of the Konkan region of India, whereas the cashew tree was an exotic species of crops, imported by the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay, from what was colonial Brazil in south America. There is ambiguity about when and who first produced a fermented beverage of cashew fruits, to make the distilled spirit of feni.

The feni consumed in southern Goa is generally of higher alcohol content (43–45% abv) as compared to the feni produced in northern Goa. Commercially packaged feni is available at 42.8% abv.

==Preparation==

===Cashew feni===

In the traditional method of making cashew feni, only tree-ripened cashew apples that have fallen are picked and taken for the crush. The cashew apples are de-seeded and then dropped into the stomping area. This area is called a &quot;collmi&quot; and is usually a rock cut into a basin shape. The cashew apples are stomped to release the juice. Stomping has now gradually been replaced by the use of a press called a &quot;pingre&quot; (cage). The pulp is then hand-patted into small mounds traditionally using a particular vine, &quot;nudi&quot;, which is snaked around it to hold it together while a heavyweight (typically a boulder) is placed on top. The juice produced through this second extraction process is known as &quot;Neero/Niro&quot;, and is refreshing to drink; however, it is not used in the fermentation process generally for making feni. The first juice extract, obtained by stomping cashew apples, is transferred traditionally in a large earthen pot called a &quot;koddem&quot;, which is buried halfway in the ground and left while the juice ferments for several days. Delicate earthen &quot;koddem&quot; have now been replaced by plastic drums for the sake of practicality. The juice is then allowed to sit for three days as it ferments. No additional yeast or nutrients are added to hasten the process.
Cashew feni is distilled employing the traditional pot, which is still practiced. A traditional still for feni is still known as a &quot;bhatti&quot;. The use of an earthen pot as the boiling pot has now been replaced with copper pots, both known by the same name, &quot;bhann&quot;. The distillate is collected in an earthen pot called a &quot;launni&quot;. The tradition of cold water being continuously poured on the &quot;launni&quot; to condense the distillate has now been replaced by immersing a coil in cold water.

Cashew feni is a triple-distilled spirit. The first distillate of the fermented &quot;neero&quot; is known as Urrak, about 15% alcohol (30 proof). &quot;Urrak&quot; is then mixed with &quot;neero&quot; in a proportion determined by the distiller, and redistilled to give a spirit called &quot;cazulo&quot; or &quot;cajulo&quot; (40–42% abv). &quot;Cazulo&quot; or &quot;cajulo&quot; is again distilled with &quot;Urrak&quot; to give a high-strength spirit called feni (45% abv). Note that &quot;cazulo&quot; is generally sold as &quot;feni&quot;, as the spirit is considered too strong of an alcoholic beverage for consumption. All cashew feni now available is double-distilled.

===Coconut feni===

Coconut feni, also known as &quot;Maddel&quot; or &quot;Maddachim Fenni&quot;, is distilled from fermented toddy from the coconut palm. Traditionally toddy is collected from the coconut palm by a toddy-tapper called a &quot;Reindér&quot;. Toddy-tapping—the collection of juice from the bud or spadix of palm tree flowers—has been practiced in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia for centuries. The sap of the coconut palm is collected in an earthen pot called a &quot;zamonnô&quot; or &quot;damonnem&quot;, which is fitted over the spadix (&quot;ipoi&quot;) that grows out of the base of each coconut leaf. In order to produce toddy, the spadix is tightly bound with a rope (&quot;gofê&quot;/&quot;gophe&quot;) made from filaments (&quot;vaiê&quot;) cut with a small knife (&quot;piskathi&quot;) from the base of the leaf, while remaining attached to the pedicle. The spadix then must be tapped all around very gently with the handle of the &quot;kathi&quot; (a flat semi-circular sickle) every alternate day until it becomes round and flexible, a sign that the sap is ready. The tip of the spadix is then cut off to let the sap ooze out into the &quot;damonnem&quot;.

Toddy is collected from the &quot;damonnem&quot; in the morning and evening, and then carried down the tree in a gourd-shaped container called a &quot;dudhinnem&quot; before being poured into a clay pot called a &quot;kollsô&quot;. The spadix is sharpened at noon by slicing a small piece horizontally off the top, called &quot;cheu&quot;, so as to reactivate the flow of sap. For three days the toddy used to be left to ferment in clay or porcelain pots, called &quot;monn&quot; or &quot;jhallo&quot;.

Coconut feni is largely produced and consumed only in South Goa. It is distilled employing the traditional pot. Coconut feni is prepared in a distillery known as a &quot;sôreachi bhatti&quot;. The use of an earthen pot as the boiling pot has now been replaced with copper cauldrons, both known by the same name, &quot;bhann&quot;. The mouth of the &quot;bhann&quot; is sealed with a wooden stopper called a &quot;mhorannem&quot;. The vapours from the &quot;bhann&quot; pass through a tube called a &quot;nollo&quot;, made from a &quot;bonnki/bonnqui&quot; stem, and are collected in a clay distillation pot called a &quot;launni&quot;, which is placed in an open clay vessel called a &quot;koddem&quot; filled with water. The copper coil is immersed in cold water to condense the vapours.

Commercially bottled coconut feni has a strength of 42.8% abv. Coconut feni is a double-distilled spirit; the first distillate is called a &quot;mollop&quot;, about 15% alcohol (30 proof). Four &quot;kollxem&quot; (plural of &quot;kollsô&quot;) of toddy produce two pots of &quot;mollop&quot;. Four pots of &quot;mollop&quot; are then mixed with one &quot;kollso&quot; of toddy, which is added to distill what is then a fiery coconut feni.

==Commerce==
The feni selling market is largely unorganised. Locals tend to buy feni directly from the thousands of traditional distillers who run seasonal mini-distilleries or stalls in the villages of Goa. A large volume of feni that is distilled is sold directly by distillers to taverns who have business relationships that extend over generations.

Cashew feni is seasonal, distilled only from late February to mid-May. It is highly dependent on the fruiting of the season. The price of cashew feni is also speculated on the fruiting season.

Coconut feni is produced throughout the year as coconut trees are tapped year round. During the monsoon months, the coconut palms produce more toddy than the drier months. Toddy tapping is very labour-intensive and so is not an appealing profession. This has led to the dramatic decline in production of coconut feni.

In the organised sector, there are also hundreds of brands to choose from that cater to the tourist market. Locals have slowly begun to switch to standardised bottled feni in recent years.

==Consumption==
Feni can be served neat or over ice, and can be mixed in classic cocktails or with juices. It can be served with a slice of lime, and sometimes with sugar or sugar syrup, which are popular additions.

Popular mixers are cola, tonic water&amp; lemonade, with the latter probably the most popular. Feni is also often mixed with Limca, Maaza, Sprite, or 7up.

Feni has also culinary applications, such as in the marinade for pork, along with garlic, ginger, Indian spices, and vinegar, as the base for the iconic Vindaloo curry.

==Geographical Indication==

Cashew feni was awarded Geographical Indication registration in 2009 as a speciality alcoholic beverage from Goa, described as a colourless, clear liquid that when matured in wooden barrels develops golden brown tint. This designation was achieved through the efforts of the Goa Cashew Feni Distillers &amp; Bottlers Association and the Department of Science, Technology &amp; Environment of the Government of Goa. The application of a G.I. for coconut feni has been neglected.

== Heritage drink ==
In 2016, the Goa government initiated a process for feni to be recognised as a heritage brew outside of the state. Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar described feni as &quot;part of our culture&quot;. Plans include nature tourism where tourists can see cashew harvesting and follow the process of the drink&#x27;s manufacture. Several distillers urged the government to issue rules on distillation process and ensure that they are obeyed. Counterfeit feni and adulteration in quality were some of the issues raised by participants.

<doc id="847973" wikidata="Q3071764" url="?curid=847973" title="Skiptrace">
<text>Skiptracing is the process of locating a person&#x27;s whereabouts. Skiptracing tactics may be employed by a skip tracer, contact tracer (in a public health context), debt collector, process server, bail bondsman or bail agency enforcer (bounty hunter), repossession agent, private investigator, lawyer, police detective, journalist, stalker or by any person attempting to locate a subject whose contact information is not immediately known. Similar techniques have also been used by investigators to locate witnesses in criminal trials.

==Terminology==
Other terms include to skip trace, or debtor and fugitive recovery. A skip tracer is someone who performs this task, which may be the person&#x27;s primary occupation. The term &quot;skip&quot; (as a noun) refers to the person being searched for, and is derived from the idiomatic expression &quot;to skip town&quot;, meaning to depart (perhaps in a rush or perhaps hoping to elude creditors or law enforcement). As such, the skip tracers need to track down (&quot;trace&quot;) the skip to their new location. The term &quot;skip&quot; is &quot;attested by the mid 14th century, meaning &#x27;to run, go, rush, flee,&#x27; and also &#x27;to make off, hasten away&#x27;.&quot;

==Methods==
Skiptracing is performed in stages. The first step is gather the basic information about the person, such as first, middle, and last name, variants (e.g., an individual named Robert may go by &quot;Rob&quot;), aliases, and nicknames. The person&#x27;s date of birth, last known physical addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers are also important. The person&#x27;s social media pages may yield clues about their whereabouts. The skip tracer also gathers historical information such as the names of schools the person attended, as this can generate leads about friends who might know their whereabouts. Skip tracers also gather information about the person&#x27;s friends, family and business associates. 

Then the skip tracer will start collecting as much information as possible about the subject using Internet searches, databases, public records, and their network of contacts. Often, the job becomes more than research since one must usually employ methods of social engineering, which involves calling or visiting former neighbors or other known contacts to ask about the person, sometimes under false or misleading pretenses. 

Records or Information that skip tracers use may include phone number databases, credit reports (including information provided on a loan application, credit card application, and in other debt collector databases), job application information, criminal background checks, utility bills, Social Security, disability, and public tax information. While some of these records may be publicly available, some cannot be accessed without an appropriate search warrant, or a specific permissible purpose, which is generally only available to financial institutions, their contracted third-party vendors, law enforcement or licensed private investigators.

Even when no specific information is returned, public and private databases exist that cross-reference skiptracing information with others the skip may have lived with in the recent past. For instance, if previous records show a skip lived in the same house as a third party, the third party may also be skiptraced in an effort to locate the primary target.

The next step is to verify the information. The information is then analyzed and verified, eliminating some leads as outdated or associated with the wrong person. Sometimes the person&#x27;s current whereabouts are in the data, but are obfuscated by the sheer amount of information or disinformation. 

In the past, skiptracing included such things as dumpster diving and pretext calls to utility companies. Currently, skiptracing is largely conducted online using paid databases and phone calls to gather and verify information. Modern social media platforms such as Facebook have greatly simplified skiptracing work.

<doc id="847974" wikidata="Q6808985" url="?curid=847974" title="Meggers (crater)">
<text>Meggers is an impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon. It was named after American physicist William F. Meggers.

The rim of Meggers is roughly circular in form, with slight outward bulges to the southeast and northeast. The crater merges with a comparably sized formation to the northwest, and the intervening rim is somewhat irregular in form. The interior floor of Meggers is slightly irregular.

Nearby craters of note include Olcott to the southwest, Innes, and Seyfert farther away to the northwest. To the east lies Vernadskiy. To the west is the crater Meggers S, a formation almost as large as Meggers itself. It has a rough interior and a tiny crater lies across the southern rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Meggers.

<text>A Blue Tory in Canadian politics is a conservative who advocates for free-market and economically liberal (sometimes known as fiscally conservative) policies such as reductions in public spending, tax cuts, opposition to deficit spending, and a more limited role of government. They also advocate self reliance, individual responsibility, personal freedom and liberty and therefore do not necessarily support social conservatism. 

The term has been applied to members of the modern Conservative Party of Canada and provincial Progressive Conservative parties, as well as the historical Reform Party of Canada and its successor, the Canadian Alliance. In contemporary language, Blue Tories are sometimes described as &quot;true-blue Conservatives&quot;.

== History ==

For the first 50 years of Canada&#x27;s existence as a country, the Conservative Party (also known as the &quot;Tories&quot;) subscribed to policies that required the government to play an active role in the economy. The signature achievement of John A. Macdonald, Canada&#x27;s first prime minister from 1867 to 1873 and from 1878 to 1891, was the National Policy, which nationalized industries and promoted high tariffs to protect domestic industries. The party strictly opposed free trade with the United States, and this vigorous opposition played a key role in the party&#x27;s return to power under Robert Borden in 1911. As such, Blue Toryism was essentially non-existent in the Conservative Party during its governance of Canada from 1867 to 1873, 1878 to 1896, and from 1911 to 1921.

However, in the 1930s, R. B. Bennett as prime minister adopted laissez-faire policies during the Great Depression, differing himself from his previous Red Tory predecessors.

=== The Common Sense Revolution in Ontario ===

One example of a provincial Blue Tory government in Canada was the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; provincial Progressive Conservative government of Ontario Premier Mike Harris. The Harris Tories were widely viewed as radical by Canadian standards in their economic policies and style of governance. Harris&#x27; government embarked on a number of initiatives, including cuts to education, welfare and Medicare, privatization of government services and health care, the sale of provincial highways and the forced amalgamation of municipalities. Provincial income taxes were also cut by 30% and corporate tax rates were nearly cut in half during the Harris mandate.

=== Harper era (2006–2015) ===

Federally, the most popular example of a Blue Tory government was that of Stephen Harper, who was prime minister from 2006 to 2015. Tax cuts were prevalent during Harper&#x27;s tenure; he reduced the goods and services tax (GST) from seven percent to five percent; reduced the corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 15 percent; and implemented personal income tax cuts during the Great Recession. Other economically liberal policies from the Harper government included the privatization of the Canadian Wheat Board, the negotiation of free-trade agreements such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), and the introduction of the tax-free savings account (TFSA). In order to balance the budget, Harper implemented various public spending cuts during his third term in office (2011–2015); one notable change was the increase in eligibility for Old Age Security from 65 years of age to 67, though this planned change did not go into effect as it was subsequently reversed by the succeeding Liberal government of Justin Trudeau in 2015.

Most Blue Tories are at least somewhat ideologically aligned close to the economically liberal positions of the former Canadian Alliance; as such, they supported the merger between the PCs and the Alliance to form the new federal Conservative Party of Canada (CPC).

== Notable adherents == 
Notable Blue Tories include:

* Mike Harris, Premier of Ontario (1995–2002)
* Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada (2006–2015)
* Ralph Klein, Premier of Alberta (1992–2006)
* Preston Manning, former leader of the Reform Party

<text>The Commodore CBM-II series is a short-lived range of 8-bit personal computers from Commodore Business Machines (CBM), released in 1982 and intended as a follow-on to the Commodore PET series.

==Technical description==
The CBM-II has two incarnations, the P series (P = personal, or, home use) and the B series (B = business use). The B series was available with a built-in monochrome monitor (hi-profile) with detached keyboard, and also as a single unit with built-in keyboard but no monitor (lo-profile). These machines are often referred to as the &quot;Porsche PETs&quot; due to incorrect rumors that the case was designed by Porsche. Though Commodore did initially consult Porsche for a case design, it proved too expensive to produce, so Commodore enlisted designer Ira Velinski to create one based on the original PET prototype.

The P-series uses the VIC-II 40-column color video chip like the Commodore 64 (C64). It also includes two standard Atari-style joystick ports. The 6509 CPU runs at 1 MHz in the P-series due to the use of the VIC-II chip.

Both B and P-series machines have a 6581 SID chip, although the B-series&#x27; 2 MHz clock speed makes it impossible to read any of the SID&#x27;s registers.

The B-series uses a 6545 CRTC video chip to give an 80-column &quot;green screen&quot; monochrome output more suitable for word processing and other business use than the VIC-II&#x27;s 40-column display. Most models have the Motorola 68B45 installed which is a pin-compatible variant rather than the MOS 6545A1 2 MHz part. On the B-series the 6509 CPU runs at 2 MHz. The joystick ports are not present on the B-series, but the connector is still on the motherboard.

CBM-IIs are the only Commodore 8-bit machines with an RS-232 port instead of the standard user port. The I/O registers for the user port are still present (as they&#x27;re an internal function of the 6522 chips) but there is no connector for it on the motherboard.

A cartridge slot is also included on the machines. JCL Software released both a BASIC extender and an assembler/editor in cartridge format.

The B-series retained the IEEE-488 interface from the PET instead of the IEC serial interface on the VIC-20 and C64. The small amount of software Commodore developed for the B-series was distributed on 500k 8050 format disks rather than the 170k 4040/1541 format.

Features common to both the P and B-series included a MOS Technology 6509 CPU, an enhanced version of the venerable 6502, that was capable of addressing up to 1 megabyte of RAM via bank switching (however, no CBM-II model came with more than 256 kilobytes of RAM). The sound chip is the 6581 SID, the same one that was used in the popular C64 but with some limitations as it was over-clocked to 2 MHz. Additionally, the CBM-II has an industry-standard RS-232 serial interface and an IEEE-488 parallel bus (for use by disk drives and printers) just like the PET/CBM series. The CBM-II&#x27;s built-in operating system uses an enhanced version of CBM BASIC version 4.0.

An optional Intel 8088-based coprocessor board allows the CBM-II series to run CP/M-86 1.1 and MS-DOS 1.25; however, the computers were not IBM PC compatible and very little, if any, software taking advantage of this capability ever appeared. The coprocessor board only runs on high-profile machines due to power supply and mechanical spacing requirements. A Z80 card was also announced if the user wished to run CP/M-80, as well as a Zilog Z8001 board, but none are known to exist. The 8088 board never reached production apparently because of difficulties getting it to work with the system.

The CBM-II line uses a complicated RAM banking scheme. Bank 0 contains the video RAM on P-series machines and is empty on B-series machines. Banks 1-4 contain the main system RAM, with Bank 15 containing the system ROMs, cartridge ROM, I/O registers, video RAM on B-series machines, and a small amount of RAM to store system variables. BASIC program text is stored in Bank 1. On 128 KB models, Bank 2 contains all BASIC variables, however on 256 KB models they&#x27;re spread out among Banks 2–4. However, unlike the later released Commodore 128, the CBM-IIs do not have the system ROMs mapped into banks other than 15, which has very limited program RAM (1k free, plus a 4k expander board could be installed). This meant that software had to include its own OS routines to handle device I/O and interrupts, as it is not possible to &quot;far call&quot; code across different memory banks. In theory, if Banks 5–14 were filled, up to 1 MB of RAM could be installed, but in practice the computer is limited to 256 KB as the PLA chip does not have enough address lines for it. Passing data between different banks requires use of the register at $1 which selects the banks to be read from and written to via LDA (zero page),Y and STA (zero page),Y CPU opcodes. The register at $0 selects the bank where the CPU fetches instructions from, which will default to 15 ($F) on power up.

The BASIC included with the CBM-II series is known as BASIC 4.0+. It contains the enhanced BASIC 4.0 disk commands as well as a few other added features for structured programming and error trapping.

Commodore had plans for a wide variety of RAM configurations as well as slimline and &quot;high profile&quot; models. The slimline machines were all-in-one units while the high-profile models had a separate keyboard and attached swivel-mount monitor. Both slimline and high-profile models have a connector for internal floppy drives and coprocessor boards, although only the latter have physical room in the case and a sufficient power supply for them. No production machines had internal floppy drives, however these likely would have been a half-height variant of the 8050. Most of the planned CBM-II models never made it past the prototype stage. Originally, there would be four models in each series, with memory increasing in 64 KB increments. 64k and 192k models were dropped early in development and no such models were produced.

In the end, the only CBM-II models to enter production and be sold to end users were the B128/600, B256/700, CBM-128/710, and PAL model P500s. The B128 and P500 were slimline models with no internal disk drives or attached monitor while the CBM 128 and B256 were high-profile models. The B128 was the biggest selling of the three.


The production naming within the United States and Canada was the B128/B256 and CBM128-80/CBM 256-80 while in Europe they were known as the 600 and 700 series respectively (no &quot;B&quot; in front of the model number). The P machine was known worldwide as the 500 series. There are prototype models though such as the B500 (earlier B128 design) and B700 (earlier CBM 128-80/CBM 256-80 design) known to exist.

==History==
Due to the popularity of the C64, the P-series was cancelled in the United States before it could be officially released; however, a few dealers who received preproduction units sold them. As the P-series had not then been certified by the FCC, Commodore were threatened with legal action and were forced to recall them. It was rumored that all recalled P-series machines were destroyed, however a handful of them are known to exist in private collections. At least one model, the P500, was commercially released in Europe but only sold in small numbers.

The most common of the B-series was the low-profile B128 (called the CBM 610 in Europe), which had 128 kilobytes of RAM. The B128 did not sell well, and ultimately Commodore&#x27;s inventory was liquidated by Protecto Enterprizes, a large Commodore mail order dealer based in Chicago, Illinois. The Protecto ads for the B128 bundle, including a dual disk drive, monitor and printer, appeared in various computer magazines for several years.

The CBM-II line sold poorly and ended up being extremely expensive to manufacture, as well as difficult to develop software for. Commodore did not release any sales figures or an official discontinuation date, however the B128/600 is the most common model in the lineup. Production ended at some point during 1984 and Commodore liquidated their remaining inventory in 1985. CBM-IIs were still being sold in Germany up to 1987. The exact number of CBM-IIs produced is unclear, however serial numbers indicate that at least 10,000 B128s were shipped along with a few dozen to a few thousand of the other models. It is believed that Commodore produced at least 5000–6000 of each machine.

After discontinuing the CBM-II range, Commodore handed its documentation, schematics, and all other information over to CBUG, the Chicago B128 Users Group.

Among these materials was a prototype motherboard using an Intel 8088 processor, which hints at the possibility the line could have been made IBM compatible if production had continued.

CBUG went on to develop a library of software for the computers. Its library, however, paled in comparison to the large software libraries enjoyed by the Commodore 64 and VIC-20.

The rounded case design of the high-profile CBM-II series would later be used in redesigned versions of the original PET/CBM computers, (such as the CBM8296) that the CBM-II line was designed to replace. In addition, the memory banking scheme of the CBM-II would be reused on the Commodore 128 with a few slight modifications.

;Notes

# Neither the CBM128-80 nor the B128 are to be confused with the very different and reasonably successful Commodore 128 (also known as CBM 128 and C128), Commodore&#x27;s final 8-bit home/personal computer, released in 1985.
# The CBM-II, due to a quirk in the input, if you do the command &quot;POKE 0,35&quot; will lock everything, and all of the memory will be filled with 00&#x27;s and FF&#x27;s.

<doc id="847998" wikidata="Q14565683" url="?curid=847998" title="Occultism in Nazism">
<text>The association of Nazism with occultism occurs in a wide range of theories, speculation, and research into the origins of Nazism and into Nazism&#x27;s possible relationship with various occult traditions. Such ideas have flourished as a part of popular culture since at least the early 1940s (during World War II), and gained renewed popularity starting in the 1960s.

Historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke analyzed the topic in his 1985 book &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot;, in which he argued there were in fact links between some ideals of Ariosophy and Nazi ideology. He also analyzed the problems of the numerous popular occult historiography books written on the topic, which he found heavily exaggerated the relationship between Nazism and the occult. Goodrick-Clarke sought to separate empiricism and sociology from the modern mythology of Nazi occultism that exists in many books which &quot;have represented the Nazi phenomenon as the product of arcane and demonic influence&quot;. He evaluated most of the 1960 to 1975 books on Nazi occultism as &quot;sensational and under-researched&quot;.

==Ariosophy==
Historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke&#x27;s 1985 book, &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot;, discusses the possibility of links between the ideas of the occult and those of Nazism. The book&#x27;s main subject is the racist-occult movement of Ariosophy, a major strand of nationalist esotericism in Germany and Austria during the 19th and early 20th centuries. He introduces his work as &quot;an underground history, concerned with the myths, symbols, and fantasies that bear on the development of reactionary, authoritarian, and Nazi styles of thinking,&quot; arguing that &quot;fantasies can achieve a causal status once they have been institutionalized in beliefs, values, and social groups.&quot;

In Goodrick-Clarke&#x27;s view, the Ariosophist movement built on the earlier ideas of the Völkisch movement, a traditionalist, pan-German response to industrialization and urbanization, but it associated the problems of modernism specifically with the supposed misdeeds of Freemasonry, Kabbalah, and Rosicrucianism in order to &quot;prove the modern world was based on false and evil principles&quot;. The Ariosophist &quot;ideas and symbols filtered through to several anti-semitic and Nationalist groups in late Wilhelmian Germany, from which the early Nazi Party emerged in Munich after the First World War.&quot; He demonstrated links between two Ariosophists and Heinrich Himmler.

==Modern mythology==
Appendix E of Goodrick-Clarke&#x27;s book is entitled &quot;The Modern Mythology of Nazi Occultism&quot;. In it, he gives a highly critical view of much of the popular literature on the topic. In his words, these books describe Hitler and the Nazis as being controlled by a &quot;hidden power … characterized either as a discarnate entity (e.g., &#x27;black forces&#x27;, &#x27;invisible hierarchies&#x27;, &#x27;unknown superiors&#x27;) or as a magical elite in a remote age or distant location&quot;. He referred to the writers of this genre as &quot;crypto-historians&quot;. The works of the genre, he wrote,

In a new preface for the 2004 edition of &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot;, Goodrick-Clarke comments that in 1985, when his book first appeared, &quot;Nazi black magic&quot; was regarded as a topic for sensational authors in pursuit of strong sales.&quot;

In his 2002 work &quot;Black Sun&quot;, which was originally intended to trace the survival of occult Nazi themes in the postwar period, Goodrick-Clarke considered it necessary to readdress the topic. He devotes one chapter of the book to &quot;the Nazi mysteries&quot;, as he terms the field of Nazi occultism there. Other reliable summaries of the development of the genre have been written by German historians. The German edition of &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot; includes an essay, &quot;Nationalsozialismus und Okkultismus&quot; (&quot;National Socialism and Occultism&quot;), which traces the origins of the speculation about Nazi occultism back to publications from the late 1930s, and which was subsequently translated by Goodrick-Clarke into English. The German historian Michael Rißmann has also included a longer &quot;excursus&quot; about &quot;Nationalsozialismus und Okkultismus&quot; in his acclaimed book on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s religious beliefs.

According to Goodricke-Clarke, the speculation of Nazi occultism originated from &quot;post-war fascination with Nazism&quot;. The &quot;horrid fascination&quot; of Nazism upon the Western mind emerges from the &quot;uncanny interlude in modern history&quot; that it presents to an observer a few decades later. The idolization of Hitler in Nazi Germany, its short-lived dominion on the European continent and Nazism&#x27;s extreme antisemitism set it apart from other periods of modern history. &quot;Outside a purely secular frame of reference, Nazism was felt to be the embodiment of evil in a modern twentieth-century regime, a monstrous pagan relapse in the Christian community of Europe.&quot;

By the early 1960s, &quot;one could now clearly detect a mystique of Nazism.&quot; A sensationalistic and fanciful presentation of its figures and symbols, &quot;shorn of all political and historical context&quot;, gained ground with thrillers, non-fiction books, and films and permeated &quot;the milieu of popular culture.&quot;

===Historiography concerning &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot;===
&quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot; is commended for specifically addressing the fanciful modern depictions of Nazi occultism, as well as carefully reflecting critical scholarly work that finds associations between Ariosophy and Nazi agency. As scholar Anna Bramwell writes, &quot;One should not be deceived by the title into thinking that it belongs to the &#x27;modern mythology of Nazi occultism&#x27;, a world of salacious fantasy convincingly dismembered by the author in an Appendix,&quot; referring to the various written, depicted, and produced material that delves into Nazi occultism without providing any reliable or relevant evidence. Instead, it is through Goodrick-Clarke&#x27;s work that several scholarly criticisms addressing occult relevance in conjunction with Ariosophist practices arise.

Historians like Martyn Housden and Jeremy Noakes commend Goodrick-Clarke for addressing the relationship between Ariosophic ideologies rooted in certain Germanic cultures and the actual agency of Nazi hierarchy; the problem, as Housden remarks, lies in the efficacy of these Ariosophic practices. As he remarks, &quot;The true value of this study, therefore, lies in its painstaking elucidation of an intrinsically fascinating subculture which helped colour rather than cause aspects of Nazism. In this context, it also leaves us pondering a central issue: why on earth were Austrian and German occultists, just like the Nazi leadership, quite so susceptible to, indeed obsessed by, specifically aggressive racist beliefs anyway?&quot; Noakes continues this general thought by concluding, &quot;[Goodrick-Clarke] provides not only a definitive account of the influence of Ariosophy on Nazism, a subject which is prone to sensationalism, but also fascinating insights into the intellectual climate of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.&quot; These reviews reflect the greatest dilemmas in Nazi occultist scholarship; the discernment between actual efficacy of possible occult practices by Nazi leaders, purpose of these practices, and modern notions and applications of occultism today largely impact the appropriate scholarship in general in making connections between plausible Nazi Ariosophic practices and blatant popular myth.

The linkages Goodrick-Clarke makes concerning Ariosophy and German society are further detailed in Peter Merkl&#x27;s &quot;Political Violence under the Swastika&quot;, in which &quot;pre-1933 Nazis&quot;, various NSDAP members, volunteered to write their memoirs and recollections about the rise of the Nazi Party in order to provide a coherent, statistical analysis of the motivations and ideals these early members hoped to pursue in German politics. From the findings, Merkl has found, through statistical evidence, that there were aspects of ideology within German society that favored intense German nationalism, ranging from what was considered to be a &quot;German Romantic&quot;, one who was &quot;beholden to the cultural and historical traditions of old Germany...&quot; to someone classified as a part of an alleged &quot;Nordic/Hitler Cult&quot;, one who followed Voelkisch (traditional, antisemitic) beliefs. To further prove the point, Merkl discovered that of those willing to submit their testimonies, &quot;Protestants tended to be German Romantics, Catholics to be anti-Semites, superpatriots, and solidarists. Areas of religious homogeneity were particularly high in anti-Semitism or in the Nordic-German cult&quot;, of which members of both religious groups were prone to &quot;Judenkoller&quot;, an alleged sudden and violent sickness that would manifest either in blatant hatred or hysteria at being within proximity of Jews. Coincidentally, Merkl mentions a relationship to this Nordic/German-agrarian cult in relation to the 19th century to a &quot;crypto-Nazi tradition&quot;, despite being written ten years prior to &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot;.

Some of this modern mythology even touches Goodrick-Clarke&#x27;s topic directly. The rumor that Adolf Hitler had encountered the Austrian monk and antisemitic publicist Lanz von Liebenfels, already at the age of 8, at Heilgenkreuz abbey, goes back to &quot;Les mystiques du soleil&quot; (1971) by Michel-Jean Angbert. &quot;This episode is wholly imaginary.&quot;

Nevertheless, Michel-Jean Angbert and the other authors discussed by Goodrick-Clarke present their accounts as real, so that this modern mythology has led to several legends that resemble conspiracy theories, concerning, for example, the Vril Society or rumours about Karl Haushofer&#x27;s connection to the occult. The most influential books were Trevor Ravenscroft&#x27;s &quot;The Spear of Destiny&quot; and &quot;The Morning of the Magicians&quot; by Pauwels and Bergier.

===Claims===
One of the earliest claims of Nazi occultism can be found in Lewis Spence&#x27;s book &quot;Occult Causes of the Present War&quot; (1940). According to Spence, Alfred Rosenberg and his book &quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot; were responsible for promoting pagan, occult and anti-Christian ideas that motivated the Nazi party.

====Demonic possession of Hitler====
For a demonic influence on Hitler, Hermann Rauschning&#x27;s &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot; is brought forward as a source. However, most modern scholars do not consider Rauschning reliable. (As Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke summarises, &quot;recent scholarship has almost certainly proved that Rauschning&#x27;s conversations were mostly invented&quot;.) The best that can be said for Rauschning&#x27;s claims may be Goodrick-Clarke&#x27;s judgment that they &quot;record ... the authentic voice of Hitler by inspired guesswork and imagination.&quot;

Similarly to Rauschning, August Kubizek, one of Hitler&#x27;s closest friends since childhood, claims that Hitler—17 years old at the time—once spoke to him of &quot;returning Germany to its former glory&quot;; of this comment August said, &quot;It was as if another being spoke out of his body, and moved him as much as it did me.&quot;

An article &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Forgotten Library&quot; by Timothy Ryback, published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; (May 2003), mentions a book from Hitler&#x27;s private library authored by Ernst Schertel. Schertel, whose interests included flagellation, dance, occultism, nudism and BDSM, had been an activist for sexual liberation before 1933. He had been imprisoned in Nazi Germany for seven months and his doctoral degree was revoked. He is supposed to have sent a dedicated copy of his 1923 book &quot;&quot; to Hitler some time in the mid-1920s. Hitler is said to have marked extensive passages, including one which reads &quot;He who does not have the demonic seed within himself will never give birth to a magical world&quot;.

Theosophist Alice A. Bailey stated during World War II that Adolf Hitler was possessed by what she called the &quot;Dark Forces&quot;. Her follower Benjamin Creme has stated that through Hitler (and a group of equally evil men around him in Nazi Germany, together with a group of militarists in Japan and a further group around Mussolini in Italy) was released the energies of the Antichrist, which, according to theosophical teachings is not an individual person but forces of destruction.

According to James Herbert Brennan in his book &quot;Occult Reich&quot;, Hitler&#x27;s mentor, Dietrich Eckhart (to whom Hitler dedicates &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;), wrote to a friend of his in 1923: &quot;Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We have given him the &#x27;means of communication&#x27; with Them. Do not mourn for me; I shall have influenced history more than any other German.&quot;

====New World Order====
Conspiracy theorists &quot;frequently identify German National Socialism among other things as a precursor of the New World Order&quot;. With regard to Hitler&#x27;s later ambition of imposing the Nazi regime throughout Europe, Nazi propaganda used the term &quot;Neuordnung&quot; (often poorly translated as &quot;the New Order&quot;, while actually referring to the &quot;re-structurization&quot; of state borders on the European map and the resulting post-war economic hegemony of Greater Germany), so one could probably say that the Nazis pursued a new world order in terms of politics. But the claim that Hitler and the Thule Society conspired to create a New World Order (a conspiracy theory, put forward on some webpages) is completely unfounded.

====Aleister Crowley====
There are also unverifiable rumours that the occultist Aleister Crowley sought to contact Hitler during World War II. Despite several allegations and speculations to the contrary, there is no evidence of such an encounter. In 1991, John Symonds, one of Crowley&#x27;s literary executors, published a book: &quot;The Medusa&#x27;s Head or Conversations Between Aleister Crowley and Adolf Hitler&quot;, which has definitively been shown to be literary fiction. That the edition of this book was limited to 350 also contributed to the mystery surrounding the topic. Mention of a contact between Crowley and Hitler—without any sources or evidence—is also made in a letter from René Guénon to Julius Evola dated October 29, 1949, which later reached a broader audience.

====Erik Jan Hanussen====
The documentary &quot;Hitler and the Occult&quot; describes how Hitler &quot;seemed endowed with even greater authority and charisma&quot; after he had resumed public speaking in March 1927. The narrator states that &quot;this may have been due to the influence&quot; of the clairvoyant performer and publicist Erik Jan Hanussen. &quot;Hanussen helped Hitler perfect a series of exaggerated poses&quot;, useful for speaking before a huge audience. The documentary then interviews Dusty Sklar about the contact between Hitler and Hanussen, and the narrator makes the statement about &quot;occult techniques of mind control and crowd domination.&quot;

Whether Hitler had met Hanussen at all is not certain. That he even encountered him before March 1927 is not confirmed by other sources about Hanussen. In the late 1920s to early 1930s Hanussen made political predictions in his own newspaper, &quot;Hanussens Bunte Wochenschau&quot;, that gradually started to favour Hitler, but until late 1932 these predictions varied. In 1929, Hanussen predicted, for example, that Wilhelm II would return to Germany in 1930 and that the problem of unemployment would be solved in 1931.

====Nazi mysticism, occultism, and science fiction====
Nazi mysticism in German culture is further expanded in an article by , &quot;SF (Science Fiction), Occult Sciences, and Nazi Myths&quot;, published in the journal &quot;Science Fiction Studies&quot;. In it, Nagl writes that the racial narratives described in contemporary German Science Fiction stories, like The Last Queen of Atlantis, by Edmund Kiss, provide further notions of racial superiority under the auspices of Ariosophy, Aryanism, and alleged historic racial Mysticism, suggesting that writings associated with possible Occultism, Ariosophy, or Aryanism were products intended to influence and justify in a socio-political manner, rather than simply establish cultural heritage. The stories themselves dealt with &quot;...heroes, charismatic leader types, (who) have been chosen by fate—with the resources of a sophisticated and extremely powerful technology&quot;. Nagl considers science fiction pieces like Atlantis further fueled the violent persuasiveness of Nazi leaders, such as Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, as further justification for a &quot;Nazi elite (envisioning) for itself in occupied East European territories&quot;. This, in turn, allegedly propagated public support of Nazi ideology, summated by Nagl as &quot;a tremendous turning back of culture, away from the age of reason and consciousness, toward the age of a &#x27;sleepwalking certainty&#x27;, the age of supra-rational magic&quot;. An example of this claim was demonstrated in World War II, when the Wehrmacht occupied Houska Castle until 1945. The Nazis were said to have conducted experiments into the occult. According to one source, there were &quot;multiple myths about their supposed occult involvements there&quot;. Another source states locals believed that the Nazis had been using the &quot;powers of Hell&quot; for their experiments. As of early 2020, the castle was open to the public and had been since 1999. Tourists may visit the chapel with fading frescoes and murals &quot;including pictures of demon-like figures and animal-like beings&quot;.

===Crypto-historic books===
In the essay that is included in the German edition of &quot;The Occult Roots...&quot;, H. T. Hakl, an Austrian publisher of esoteric works, traces the origins of the speculation about Nazism and Occultism back to several works from the early 1940s. His research was also published in a short book, &quot;Unknown sources: National Socialism and the Occult&quot;, translated by Goodrick-Clarke. Already in 1933 a pseudonymous &quot;Kurt van Emsen&quot; described Hitler as a &quot;demonic personality&quot;, but his work was soon forgotten. The first allusions that Hitler was directed by occult forces which were taken up by the later authors came from French Christian esotericist René Kopp. In two articles published in the monthly esoteric journal &quot;Le Chariot&quot; from June 1934 and April 1939, he seeks to trace the source of Hitler&#x27;s power to supernatural forces. The second article was titled: &quot;L&#x27;Enigme du Hitler&quot;. In other French esoteric journals of the 1930s, Hakl could not find similar hints. In 1939 another French author, Edouard Saby, published a book: &quot;Hitler et les Forces Occultes&quot;. Saby already mentions Hanussen and Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln. Hakl even hints that Edouard Saby would have the copyright on the myth of Nazi occultism. However, another significant book from 1939 is better known: Hermann Rauschning&#x27;s &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot;. There it is said (in the chapter &quot;Black and White Magic&quot;), that &quot;Hitler surrendered himself to forces that carried him away. … He turned himself over to a spell, which can, with good reason and not simply in a figurative analogy, be described as demonic magic.&quot; The chapter &quot;Hitler in private&quot; is even more dramatic, and was left out in the German edition from 1940.

Goodrick-Clarke examines several pseudo-historic &quot;books written about Nazi occultism between 1960 and 1975&quot;, that &quot;were typically sensational and under-researched&quot;. He terms this genre &quot;crypto-history&quot;, as its defining element and &quot;final point of explanatory reference is an agent which has remained concealed to previous historians of National Socialism&quot;. Characteristic tendencies of this literature include: (1) &quot;a complete ignorance of primary sources&quot; and (2) the repetition of &quot;inaccuracies and wild claims&quot;, without the attempt being made to confirm even &quot;wholly spurious &#x27;facts&#x27;&quot;. Books debunked in Appendix E of &quot;The Occult Roots of Nazism&quot; are:

* Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, 1960, &quot;The Morning of the Magicians&quot;
* Dietrich Bronder, 1964, &quot;Bevor Hitler kam&quot;
* Trevor Ravenscroft, 1972, &quot;The Spear of Destiny&quot;
* Michel-Jean Angbert, 1971, &quot;Les mystiques du soleil&quot;
* J. H. Brennan, 1974, &quot;The Occult Reich&quot;.

==Documentaries==
More than 60 years after the end of the Third Reich, Nazism and Adolf Hitler have become a recurring subject in history documentaries. Among these documentaries, there are several that focus especially on the potential relations between Nazism and occultism, such as the History Channel&#x27;s documentary &quot;Hitler and the Occult&quot;. As evidence of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;occult power&quot; this documentary offers, for example, the infamous statement by Joachim von Ribbentrop of his continued subservience to Hitler at the Nuremberg Trials. After the author Dusty Sklar has pointed out that Hitler&#x27;s suicide happened at the night of April 30/May 1, which is Walpurgis Night, the narrator continues: &quot;With Hitler gone, it was as if a spell had been broken.&quot; A much more plausible reason for Hitler&#x27;s suicide (that does not involve the paranormal) is that the Red Army had already closed to within several hundred meters of Hitler&#x27;s bunker and he did not want to be captured alive.
From the perspective of academic history, these documentaries on Nazism, if ever commented, are seen as problematic because they do not contribute to an actual understanding of the problems that arise in the study of Nazism and Neo-Nazism. Without referring to a specific documentary Mattias Gardell, a historian who studies contemporary separatist groups, writes:

&quot;Hitler and the Occult&quot; includes a scene in which Hitler is seen as speaking at a huge mass meeting. While Hitler&#x27;s speech is not translated, the narrator talks about the German occultist and stage mentalist Erik Jan Hanussen: &quot;Occultists believe, Hanussen may also have imparted occult techniques of mind control and crowd domination on Hitler&quot; (see below). Historians have dismissed myths such as those about Erik Jan Hanussen.

===Ernst Schäfer&#x27;s expedition to Tibet===
At least one documentary, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Search for the Holy Grail,&quot; includes footage from the 1939 German expedition to Tibet. The documentary describes it as &quot;the most ambitious expedition&quot; of the SS. This original video material was made accessible again by Marco Dolcetta in his series &quot;Il Nazismo Esoterico&quot; in 1994. An interview that Dolcetta conducted with Schäfer does not support the theories of Nazi occultism, neither does Reinhard Greve&#x27;s 1995 article &quot;Tibetforschung im SS Ahnenerbe&quot; (&quot;Tibet Research Within the SS Ahnenerbe&quot;), although the latter does mention the occult thesis. Hakl comments that Greve should have emphasized more strongly the unreliability of authors like Bergier and Pauwels or Angbert. Ernst Schäfer&#x27;s expedition report explicitly remarks on the &quot;worthless goings-on&quot; by &quot;a whole army of quacksalvers&quot; concerning Asia and especially Tibet.

<text>The South Street barrow is a Neolithic long barrow in the English county of Wiltshire, near Beckhampton. It lies around 70 metres southeast of the cove of The Longstones and may therefore be connected with the Neolithic ritual landscape centred on Avebury.

The mound was about 43 metres long and 17m wide, but cultivation has spread the material and reduced the mound&#x27;s height.

It was excavated between 1964 and 1966 by Paul Ashbee who found no evidence of burials beneath the barrow and conjectured that it was a kind of cenotaph. He found that it had been built around a number of wicker partitions using alternate layers of white chalk and darker earth. This material was probably excavated from flanking ditches surrounding the site, which survive as infilled features.

<text>The United Party for National Development (UPND) is a prominent political party in Zambia, founded in December 1998 by Anderson Mazoka, a former executive of the Anglo American Corporation. The party emerged as a significant opposition force following a split from the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD). The UPND positions itself as a centrist party with strong ideological commitments to social and economic liberalism, advocating for policies that support free-market principles, human rights, and democratic governance.

The UPND rose to national prominence under the leadership of Anderson Mazoka and his protege, Hakainde Hichilema, a businessman who assumed the party&#x27;s presidency after Mazoka&#x27;s death in 2006. Under Hichilema&#x27;s leadership, the party continued to be a major force in Zambian politics, contesting multiple elections before finally winning the presidency decisively in the 2021 elections. Hichilema&#x27;s victory marked the UPND&#x27;s transition from opposition to governance, with the party now playing a crucial role in shaping the country&#x27;s political and economic landscape.

The party&#x27;s internal structure includes the National Management Committee (NMC), its chief executive organ, which is elected every five years during the party&#x27;s General Assembly. The NMC is responsible for electing the National Executive Committee (NEC), which handles day-to-day decision-making within the party.

The UPND is also a member of the Africa Liberal Network, aligning itself with other liberal parties across the continent.

==History==
The UPND was established in December 1998 and was initially led by Anderson Mazoka, who had left the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) shortly before that. Mazoka was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 2001 general elections, finishing second with 27% of the vote, less than 2% behind the winner Levy Mwanawasa of the MMD. In the National Assembly elections the UPND won 49 seats, becoming the second largest party after the MMD.

In March 2006, the party joined the United Democratic Alliance, formed by the three largest opposition parties to contest that year&#x27;s general elections. After the death of Mazoka in May 2006, Hakainde Hichilema became party leader, and was the alliance&#x27;s presidential candidate. However, he finished third behind Mwanawasa and Michael Sata with 25% of the vote. The UDA won only 26 seats in the National Assembly, down from the 74 the three parties had won in 2001.

Hichilema was the UPND candidate for the 2008 presidential by-election, finishing third with 20% of the vote. He finished third again in the 2011 general elections with 18% of the vote, whilst the UPND won 28 seats in the National Assembly, becoming the third-largest party.

Hichilema was selected as the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2015 presidential by-election. Hichilema became the main opponent to the Patriotic Front (PF) candidate Edgar Lungu after receiving the backing of several MMD MPs. Although Hichilema received 47% of the vote, Lungu was elected with 48% of the vote.

In the 2021 general election, after almost 23 years in opposition, the UPND became the largest party in the National Assembly, adding 24 more seats and making a total 82 seats, forming 46.64% of parliament. The PF lost 21 seats, bringing their total to 59 (35.30% of parliament) and becoming Zambia&#x27;s largest opposition party.

On the executive level, the UPND President Hakainde Hichilema was re-elected to the party presidency at the elective General Conference on 14 February 2021 and Mutale Nalumango was appointed as his running-mate on 23 February 2021. Also leading to the 2021 general election on 12 August, the UPND formed an alliance in March dubbed the UPND Alliance with several smaller political parties including former PF members and allies such as former finance minister Felix Mutati, lawyer Kelvin Fube Bwalya and engineer Charles Milupi among others. After three months of official campaigns that were briefly suspended first voluntarily upon the death of Zambia&#x27;s first President Kenneth Kaunda in June, and then on instruction from the electoral authority due to incidents of political violence in the Lusaka, Mpulungu, Nakonde and Namwala districts, Hichilema and Nalumango were elected President-Elect and Vice President-Elect with 2,852,348 votes or 59.02% of the vote.

The UPND has a youth league, the UPND Youth League. This youth League was formed to mobilise youth concerns. It represents young people from across Zambia. The party has signed a social contract with the youths, making it the first political party in Africa to have a youthful agenda.

<text>Southwest Baptist University (SBU) is a private Baptist university in Bolivar, Missouri. It is affiliated with the Missouri Baptist Convention, which is part of the Southern Baptist Convention. In 2023, it had a total enrollment of 2,168 students enrolled.

==History==
Abner S. Ingman and James R. Maupin founded Southwest Baptist College in 1878 in Lebanon, Missouri. The Lebanon campus originally had an enrollment of 60 students and six faculty. The college lasted one year before the city decided it no longer wanted it. When news got out that the college would be moving, the communities of Aurora, Monett, and Bolivar in southwest Missouri attempted to attract the college. In 1879, the state of Missouri chartered the school and it moved to Bolivar, Missouri. The college went through many financial difficulties in the early part of the twentieth century.

On June 1, 1910, at 11:00 am., the fire that would destroy the campus started. The fire broke out under suspect circumstances, leading some to believe arson was the cause. Bolivar citizen firefighters tried to put out the fire, but the water supply ran dry and at 2:00 pm the fire engulfed the whole campus. Losses were estimated at $20,000. The college was rebuilt, and reopened in 1913.

Southwest Baptist University was granted an exception to Title IX in 2015, allowing the school to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.

In November 2021 its accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, placed it on probation for being in noncompliance on criteria related to governance, academic freedom, and effective leadership. In November 2023, the Higher Learning Commission removed the university from.

===Campus history===
When it reopened in 1913 as a junior college, Southwest Baptist College consisted of four buildings, two of which still stand on the Stufflebaum campus. Among the buildings still standing from the original Stufflebam campus are Casebolt Apartments (formerly Casebolt Science Building) and Memorial Hall.

On March 26, 1962, a fire destroyed Pike Auditorium. Students and townspeople saved eight pianos and almost all of the sports equipment from the locker rooms of the multipurpose building at that time. Pike Auditorium was the only building destroyed by the fire. The fire became a turning point in the history of Southwest Baptist. The newly elected president, Robert E. Craig, used the event to stimulate the buying of of farmland south of Bolivar. This farmland expanded into the Shoffner Campus on which Southwest Baptist University resides today.

The Shoffner campus, located approximately a quarter-mile south of Stufflebaum campus, was first used in 1962 with the opening of Beasley Hall. Within ten years, Landen Hall (formerly New Men&#x27;s Dorm), Leslie Hall, the Goodson Student Union, and the Wayne and Betty Gott Educational Center (formerly the campus library) were opened. In 1977, Mellers Dining Commons was opened, adjoining the Goodson Student Union.

In 1981, the Gene Taylor National Free Enterprise Center was opened to facilitate the College of Business and Computer Science. This was the same year in which Southwest Baptist College became Southwest Baptist University. In 1989, the Sells Administrative Building was completed to accommodate the growing administrative department of Southwest Baptist University.

In 1992, the Wheeler Science Center opened, giving the science department a facility capable of housing hundreds of students. The school of Physical Therapy was located in this building until it moved to a nearby, offsite location.

In 1995, SBU agreed with St. John&#x27;s School of Nursing, a traditionally Catholic institution, to form St. John&#x27;s School of Nursing of Southwest Baptist University located in Springfield, Missouri. It has since been renamed the Mercy College of Nursing and Health Sciences of Southwest Baptist University.

The Wayne and Betty Gott Educational Center was renovated in 1998 to accommodate classroom needs. The campus library moved to what is now the Jester Learning and Performance Center, and was renamed the Harriet K. Hutchens Library, which opened in 1996. The rest of the Jester Learning and Performance Center was completed in 2001. It currently houses the Davis-Newport Theater, the Department of Language and Literature, the Department of Art and the Bob R. Derryberry School of Communication Arts.

The most recent addition to the Shoffner campus is the Jane and Ken Meyer Wellness and Sports Center. It opened to students in January 2005. This facility houses an indoor track, intramural gym, fitness center, pool, café, racquetball courts, rock wall, and Hammons Court, the home of Bearcat Basketball.

<doc id="848026" wikidata="Q5250575" url="?curid=848026" title="Deepdene (diamond)">
<text>The Deepdene is a yellow diamond widely considered to be the largest irradiated diamond in the world.

== Origin of the name ==

The Deepdene gets its name from the Pennsylvania estate of Margaret Adams Plummer, wife of Curtis Bok, both the diamond&#x27;s original owners. At the time, the Deepdene weighed slightly more at and was mounted in a diamond clip. Harry Winston bought the diamond from the Boks in 1954 and it eventually found its way to a London firm in 1960 and later to a German owner.

== Irradiation scandal ==

On 27 May 1971, Christie&#x27;s auction house in Geneva offered to prospective buyers the cushion-cut, fancy golden-yellow diamond which would only later come to be known as the &quot;Deepdene&quot;. Its clarity was stated as VVS1 (with two very small imperfections near the girdle or midsection of the stone) and its vivid-yellow colour was guaranteed to be natural by both the German gemological institute and the University of Mainz.

However, Eduard Gübelin, the founder of Gübelin Gem Lab in Lucerne, Switzerland, had the opportunity to inspect the diamond before the auction took place. Gübelin&#x27;s experience with examining gemstones and recognizing artificially colored diamonds led him to declare that the Deepdene had been irradiated, likely by neutron bombardment. Gübelin warned Christie&#x27;s and any buyers who would listen, but the sale was allowed to continue with the recommendation that the stone be examined by another lab.

After being sold to jewelers Van Cleef &amp; Arpels for a reported £190,000 (about US$460,000 at the time), the Deepdene was sent to the Gem Testing Laboratory in London, England. The lab&#x27;s director, gemological pioneer Basil Anderson, was given the task of substantiating Gübelin&#x27;s claims. That he did, using spectral analysis, with damning results. Van Cleef &amp; Arpels promptly returned the stone for a refund, leaving it somewhat of an unwanted orphan. In 1997, Christies auctioned the diamond once again, but listed as an irradiated gem with a substantially lower estimate. It sold to Lawrence Graff of Graff Diamonds, who sold it to famed author Danielle Steel. Its current whereabouts remain uncertain.

Assuming Winston did not have the irradiation treatment done, it could have taken place any time between 1955 (when Winston sold it) and 1971, the year it was offered at auction. The recutting of the gem from to was most likely intended to remove the &#x27;umbrella&#x27; coloration pattern it had around its culet. This was a common side effect seen in early irradiated diamonds, but irradiation techniques have been improved so that it no longer occurs.

The character was made famous by three films about the character directed in Germany by Fritz Lang: &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot; (silent, 1922), &quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot; (1933), and the much later &quot;The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse&quot; (1960). Five other films featuring Dr. Mabuse were made by other directors in Germany in the early 1960s, followed by Jess Franco&#x27;s interpretation &quot;The Vengeance of Dr. Mabuse&quot; in 1971.

Although the character was deliberately written to mimic villains such as Dr. Fu Manchu, Guy Boothby&#x27;s Doctor Nikola, Fantômas, or Svengali, the last of which was a direct inspiration, Jacques&#x27; goals were commercial success and to make political comments, in much the same way that the film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920) had done just a few years previously.

Much of the Mabuse works are comments by Jacques on German society, in some case, the political excesses of the 1930s.

==Description==
Dr. Mabuse is a master of disguise and telepathic hypnosis known to employ body transference, most often through demonic possession, but sometimes utilizing object technologies such as television or phonograph machines, to build a &quot;society of crime&quot;. Mabuse rarely commits his crimes in person, instead operating primarily through a network of agents enacting his schemes, thus remaining a shadowy figure. Mabuse&#x27;s agents range from career criminals working for him, to innocents blackmailed or hypnotized into cooperation, to dupes manipulated so successfully that they do not realize that they are doing exactly what Mabuse planned for them to do.

Mabuse&#x27;s identity often changes; one &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot; may be defeated and sent to an asylum, jail or the grave, only for a new &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot; to later appear, as depicted in &quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot;. The replacement invariably has the same methods, the same powers of hypnosis and the same criminal genius. There are even suggestions in some installments of the series that the &quot;real&quot; Mabuse is some sort of spirit that possesses a series of hosts. Mabuse is not a name in the normal sense, more a codename, or an ideology.

Mabuse has had a number of nemeses, with the main ones including Prosecutor (or Chief Inspector) von Wenk in &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot; (played by Bernhard Goetzke) and Kommissar Karl Lohmann (played variously by Otto Wernicke and Gert Fröbe as &quot;Inspector Carl Lohemann&quot;).

==History==
Mabuse first appeared in the 1921 German novel (&quot;Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler&quot;) by Norbert Jacques. The novel benefitted from unprecedented publicity and quickly became a best-seller. Fritz Lang, already an accomplished director, worked with his wife Thea von Harbou on a revision of the novel to bring it to the screen, where it also became a great success. The film &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot; (1922), with a playing time of more than four hours, was released in two sections: &quot;The Great Gambler: An Image of the Time&quot; and &quot;Inferno: A Game for the People of our Age&quot;.

Despite the success of the novel and the film, it was almost a decade before anything more was done with the character. Jacques had been working on a sequel to the novel, named &quot;Mabuse&#x27;s Colony&quot;, in which Mabuse has died and a group of his devotees are starting an island colony, based on the principles described by Mabuse&#x27;s manifesto. However, the novel was unfinished. After conversations with Lang and von Harbou, Jacques agreed to discontinue the novel and the sequel instead became the 1933 movie &quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot;, in which the Mabuse of 1922 – played again by Rudolf Klein-Rogge – is an inmate in an insane asylum but has for some time been obsessively writing meticulous plans for crime and terrorism, plans that are being performed by a gang of criminals outside the asylum, who receive their orders from a person who has identified himself to them only as Dr. Mabuse.

<text>In baseball statistics, pitch count is the number of pitches thrown by a pitcher in a game.

Pitch counts are especially a concern for young pitchers, pitchers recovering from injury, or pitchers who have a history of injuries. The pitcher wants to keep the pitch count low to maintain their stamina. Often a starting pitcher will be removed from the game after 100 pitches, regardless of the actual number of innings pitched, as it is reckoned to be the maximum optimal pitch count for a starting pitcher. It is unclear if the specialization and reliance on relief pitchers led to pitch counts, or if pitch counts led to greater use of relievers. Pitch counts are sometimes less of a concern for veteran pitchers, who after years of conditioning are often able to pitch deeper into games. A pitcher&#x27;s size, stature, athleticism, and pitching style (and/or type of pitch thrown) can also play a role in how many pitches a pitcher can throw in a single game while maintaining effectiveness and without risking injury.

Pitch count can also be used to gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of a pitcher. It is better under most circumstances for a pitcher to use the fewest pitches possible to get three outs. Pitching efficiency is typically measured by &quot;pitches per inning&quot; or &quot;pitches per plate appearance&quot;.

Opposing teams also pay attention to pitch counts, and may try to foul off as many pitches as possible (or at least any difficult-to-hit pitches) either to tire the pitcher out, or to inflate the pitch count and drive a pitcher from the game early in favor of a possibly less effective relief pitcher.

==Youth limits ==
Little League has imposed a strict pitch count limit on pitchers. A pitcher must be removed immediately upon the current at-bat or the current half-inning ends, whichever comes first, upon reaching the pitch count per day.

Once a pitcher throws 21 pitches (under 14) or 31 pitches (15–18) in a game, the pitcher must rest and not participate in pitching. Furthermore, pitchers may not be catchers if more than 40 pitches were thrown by the player.


==Criticism==
Before pitch counts became prominent in the 1980s, a pitcher primarily &quot;pitched until he could no longer get anyone out or the game was over.&quot; As pitch counts have become more prominent, pitchers are often removed from games independent of whether or not they are tired or still pitching effectively. The use of pitch counts has been influenced by agents wanting to protect their clients, and organizations wanting to protect investments in their pitchers. This change has shifted the expectations of starting pitchers from pitching complete games to quality starts of six innings instead.

Opponents of the pitch count have argued that the inclusion of the pitch count has hurt pitchers more than it has protected them. Critics of the pitch count argue that pitchers are &quot;babied&quot; and that many of the injuries that pitchers have suffered since the inclusion of the pitch count are from such treatment. Advocates who are against using the pitch count as a metric to measure pitcher performance include Minnesota Twins broadcaster/Hall of Famer Bert Blyleven; Hall of Famer, former Texas Rangers CEO/President, and current Houston Astros executive adviser Nolan Ryan; the late New York Mets Hall of Famer Tom Seaver; and former Florida Marlins manager Jack McKeon. McKeon openly told his pitchers (and the media) that he did not keep a pitch count, and that he expected his pitchers to get into the mindset of completing what they started (i.e., for his starters to pitch a complete game). Ryan&#x27;s sentiments are similar to McKeon&#x27;s, declaring that pitch counts are largely frivolous. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; sports writer Bruce Jenkins has suggested that a &quot;relief&quot; (i.e. lesser) pitcher should start the game, so that the &quot;starting&quot; (i.e. stronger) pitcher would play the more crucial later innings. This idea would eventually become known as the opener, and began seeing significant usage in 2018. 

Rany Jazayerli estimates that two thirds of young starting pitchers from 1999 on are still playing five years later, compared to one of two between 1984 and 1998, and attributes the improvement to greater emphasis on the pitch count. Some argue that pitch counts do not account for easy outings for pitchers with big leads but higher pitch counts or pitchers in constant trouble in a game with lower pitch counts. Others feel the count is a self-fulfilling prophecy, where a pitcher can feel great until learning of his pitch count. However, author Peter Morris noted that &quot;a lot more guys hit 10 homers a season these days&quot;, and pitchers need to throw their best stuff more often. &quot;Guys who throw 100 pitches now are working harder than guys who threw 120 pitches a generation ago.&quot; Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley said hitters are &quot;bigger, stronger, better, and they hit better. And parks are smaller now, let alone the steroid era.&quot; Hitters have also become more selective (making pitchers throw more strikes) to increase their pitch count to get them out of the game earlier. Former pitcher Gene Garber says umpires are calling a smaller strike zone, making it more difficult for pitchers to throw strikes.

Television networks and stations only displayed pitch counts occasionally, with the Boston Red Sox&#x27;s NESN and New York Yankees&#x27;s YES being the first to do so within their full on-screen graphics at all times in 2010. ESPN soon followed suit, and as of Opening Day 2014, the Fox Sports regional networks, along with Fox&#x27;s national package also adopted full-time pitch count displays.

==History==
Since the 1960s, it has not been common for the starting pitcher to pitch a complete game. According to Baseball Reference pitchers have completed less than 30 percent of their starts every year since 1959. Comparisons with the dead-ball era pre-1920 are misleading, since the pitcher&#x27;s behavior was very different. Some examples of high pitch count games include a 26-inning game on May 1, 1920 where Leon Cadore of Brooklyn and Joe Oeschger of Boston pitched an estimated 345 and 319 pitches; also, Nolan Ryan threw 164 in a 1989 game, aged 42. Stats LLC began tracking pitch counts in 1988, and MLB keeps official data since 1999. The highest pitch count since 1990 is 172, by Tim Wakefield for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the Atlanta Braves on April 27, 1993; however, it should be known that Wakefield&#x27;s primary pitch was the knuckleball, an off-speed pitch. Off-speed pitches are less strenuous on a pitcher&#x27;s arm compared to a fastball. Pitch counts above 125 are increasingly rare:
On June 25, 2010, Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Edwin Jackson threw 149 pitches in a no-hitter. This was the highest pitch count in an MLB game since 2005.

<text>The MOS Technology 6509, an enhanced version of the popular 6502 microprocessor, is capable of addressing up to 1 megabyte of RAM via bank switching. While numerous 6502-based processors can perform bank switching, they achieve this via separate logic. The 6509 has this logic on-chip.

Passing data between different banks requires use of the register at $1 which selects the banks to be read from and written to via LDA (zero page), Y and STA (zero page), Y CPU opcodes. The register at $0 selects the bank where the CPU fetches instructions from, which will default to 15 ($F) on power up.

The 6509 has a reputation for being difficult to program, due to its bank switching scheme. It is used in the Commodore CBM-II line of computers.

<text>Arinna was the major cult center of the Hittite sun-goddess known as dUTU URU&quot;Arinna&quot; or &quot;Sun-Goddess of Arinna&quot;, who is also sometimes identified as &quot;Arinniti&quot; or as &quot;Wuru(n)šemu&quot;. Arinna was located near Hattusa, the Hittite capital.

The Sun-Goddess of Arinna is the most important one of three important solar deities of the Hittite pantheon, besides dUTU &quot;nepisas&quot; &#x27;the sun of the sky&#x27; and dUTU &quot;taknas&quot; &#x27;the sun of the earth&#x27;.

She was considered to be the chief deity in some sources, in place of her husband. Her consort was the Storm-God; they and their children were all derived from the former Hattic pantheon.

The goddess was also perceived to be a paramount chthonic or earth goddess. She becomes largely syncretised with the Hurrian goddess Hebat, as the Hittite Storm-God was with Teshub.

In the late 14th century BC, King Mursili II was particularly devoted to the Sun-Goddess of Arinna.

Karaşehir Hüyük has been suggested as the site of Arinna.

<text>The Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation, or APOLLO, is a project at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. It is an extension and advancement of previous Lunar Laser Ranging experiments, which use retroreflectors on the Moon to track changes in lunar orbital distance and motion.

Using telescopes on Earth, the reflectors on the Moon, and accurate timing of laser pulses, scientists were able to measure and predict the orbit of the Moon to a precision of a few centimeters by the early 2000s. This precision provides the best known test of many aspects of our theories of gravity. APOLLO improves this precision even further, measuring the distance between the Moon and Earth to within a few millimeters. Using this information, scientists will be able to further test various aspects of gravity, such as: determining whether the Earth and the Moon react the same to gravity despite their different compositions, investigating the predictions of Einstein with respect to the energy content of the Earth and the Moon and how they react to gravity, and evaluating whether general relativity correctly predicts the motion of the Moon.

The APOLLO collaboration built their apparatus on the 3.5 meter telescope at Apache Point in southern New Mexico. By using a large telescope at a site with good atmospheric seeing, the APOLLO collaboration gets much stronger reflections than any existing facilities. APOLLO records approximately one returned laser photon per pulse, as opposed to the roughly 0.01 photon-per-pulse average experienced by previous LLR facilities. The stronger return signal from APOLLO translates to much more accurate measurements.

== History and motivation ==

High precision Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) started soon after the Apollo 11 astronauts left the first retroreflector on the Moon. Additional reflectors were left by the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 astronauts, and two French-built reflector arrays were placed on the Moon by the Soviet Luna 17 (Lunokhod 1) and Luna 21 (Lunokhod 2) lunar rover missions. Over the years since, many groups and experiments have used this technique to study the behavior of the Earth–Moon system, investigating gravitational and other effects.

For the first few years of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, the distance between the observatory and the reflectors could be measured to an accuracy of about . Improved techniques and equipment lead to accuracies of until about 1984. Then McDonald Observatory built a special purpose system (MLRS) just for ranging, and achieved accuracies of roughly in the mid-to-late 1980s. In the early 1990s a French LLR system at the Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur (OCA) started operation, with similar precision.

The McDonald and OCA stations are collecting data that is about as good as possible, given the number of photons that they collect back from the reflectors. Although minor improvements are possible, getting significantly better data requires a larger telescope and a better site. This is the basic goal of the APOLLO collaboration.

The APOLLO laser has been operational since October 2005, and routinely achieves millimeter-level range accuracy between the Earth and the Moon.

==Science goals==

The goal of APOLLO is to push LLR into the millimeter range precision, which then translates directly into an order-of-magnitude improvement in the determination of fundamental physics parameters. Specifically, assuming improvements of a factor of ten over prior measurements, APOLLO will test:
*the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) to a part in ,
*the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) to a few parts in ,
*de Sitter relativistic precession to a few parts in , and
*the time variation of the gravitational constant &quot;G&quot; to a part in per year.

=== Tests of the Equivalence Principles ===

The Weak Equivalence Principle says that all objects fall the same way in a gravity field, no matter what they are made of. The Earth and the Moon have very different compositions—for example, the Earth has a large iron core, but the Moon does not. Furthermore, both are in orbit around the Sun, meaning that they are both falling towards the Sun at all times, even as they revolve around each other. If the Earth and the Moon were affected differently by the gravity of the Sun, this would directly affect the orbit of the Moon around the Earth. As closely as scientists can measure, the orbit of the Moon is just as predicted from assuming that gravity acts the same on each — to within 1 part in , the Earth and the Moon fall towards the Sun in exactly the same way, despite their different compositions. APOLLO will lead to even tighter limits.

The Strong Equivalence Principle, according to Albert Einstein&#x27;s general relativity, predicts that the mass of any object consists of two parts – the mass of the atoms themselves, plus the mass of the energy that holds the object together. The question is whether the energy portion of mass contributes to measured gravity of the object, or to the inertia. In general relativity, the self-energy affects both the gravitational field and inertia, and does so equally.

Other modern theories, such as string theory, quintessence, and various forms of quantum gravity, almost all predict a violation of the Strong Equivalence Principle at some level. Additionally, many puzzling experimental results, such as galaxy rotation curves that imply the existence of dark matter or supernova observations that imply the existence of dark energy, could also potentially be explained by alternative theories of gravity (see, for example, MOND). Therefore, experimentalists believe it is important to make the most precise measurements of gravity possible, looking for any possible anomalies or confirming Einstein&#x27;s predictions.

Precise ranging to the Moon can test the SEP since the Earth and the Moon have a different fraction of their mass in the energy component. Precision measurements are needed since this component is very small – if &quot;m&quot;E is the self energy of the Earth — the energy needed to spread the atoms of the Earth out to infinity against the attraction of gravity — then the mass of the Earth is by about &quot;m&quot;E/&quot;c&quot; = of the Earth’s total mass. The self energy of the Moon is smaller yet, about of its mass. (The contribution for any object of laboratory size is negligible, about , so only measurements of planet-sized or bigger objects would allow this effect to be measured.)

If the Moon revolved around only the Earth, there would be no way to tell what fraction of the Moon&#x27;s or the Earth&#x27;s gravity was caused by each form of mass, since only the total can be measured. However, the orbit of the Moon is also strongly affected by the gravity of the Sun – in essence, Earth and Moon are in free fall around the Sun. If the energy portion of mass behaves differently from the conventional portion, then the Earth and the Moon will fall differently toward the Sun, and the orbit of the Moon around the Earth will be affected. For example, suppose the energy part of the mass does affect gravity, but does not affect inertia. Then:

From our perspective on Earth, this would appear as a displacement, or polarization, of the lunar
orbit away from the Sun with an amplitude of 13 meters. If the violation went the other way, with the
self energy possessing inertial mass but not gravitational mass, the lunar orbit would appear to be
polarized toward the Sun by the same amplitude. The calculation of the amplitude is complicated, but a crude estimate may be derived by multiplying the Earth’s orbital radius of by the contribution to the Earth’s mass from the self-energy to yield 75 meters.
The signature of an EP violation is very simple, depending only on the distance of the Moon from the Sun. This repeats about every 29.5 days, somewhat longer than the time the Moon takes to go around the Earth once, which is 27.3 days. (This difference arises since the Earth moves along its orbit as the Moon goes around, so the Moon has to make a little more than one orbit to get back to the same position relative to the Sun.) This makes EP particularly easy to measure, since many confounding effects such as tides or weather will not repeat at 29.5-day intervals. Unfortunately, there is one effect – radiation pressure acting on the orbit of the Moon – that does repeat each 29.5 days. Fortunately, it is small, less than 4 mm, and fairly easy to model, which allows it to be subtracted out.

Finally, even if the experiments show no effect, there is a tiny theoretical loophole. The measurements show the sum of the WEP and SEP violations. If the experiments show no effect, the most natural explanation is that neither WEP or SEP are violated. But it is conceptually possible that both are violated, and by equal and opposite amounts. This would be an incredible coincidence since WEP and SEP depend on very different and arbitrary properties – the exact composition of the Earth and the Moon, and their self-energies. But this unlikely case cannot be completely ruled out until either other solar system bodies are measured to similar precision, or laboratory experiments reduce the bounds on WEP violations alone.

=== Variations in the gravitational constant ===
Existing ranging experiments can measure the constancy of the gravitational constant, &quot;G&quot;, to about one part in per year. The expansion rate of the universe is approximately one part in per year. So if &quot;G&quot; scaled with the size or expansion of the universe, existing experiments would already have seen this variation. This result can also be viewed as experimental verification of the theoretical result that gravitationally bound systems do not partake in the general expansion of the universe. APOLLO will place much tighter bounds on any such variations.

=== Other tests ===
At this level of accuracy, general relativity is needed to predict the orbit of the Moon. Current tests measure geodetic precession to a 0.35% level of precision, gravitomagnetism at the 0.1% level, and checks whether gravity behaves as 1/&quot;r&quot; as expected. APOLLO will improve on all these measurements.

== Principles of operation ==

APOLLO is based on measuring the time-of-flight of a short-pulse laser reflected from a distant target—in this case the retroreflector arrays on the Moon. Each burst of light lasts 100 picoseconds (ps). One millimeter in range corresponds to only 6.7 ps of round-trip travel time. However, the retroreflectors on the Moon introduce more than one millimeter of error themselves. They are not usually at an exact right angle to the incoming beam, so the different corner cubes of the retroreflectors are at different distances from the transmitter. This is because the Moon, although it keeps one face to the Earth, does not do so exactly—it wobbles from side to side and up and down, by as much as 10° in magnitude. (See libration.) These librations occur since the Moon rotates at constant speed, but has an elliptical and inclined orbit. This effect may seem small, but it is not only measurable, it forms the largest unknown in finding the range, since there is no way to tell which corner cube reflected each photon. The biggest array, the Apollo 15 reflector, can have a corner-to-corner range spread of ≈ 1.2 sin (10°) m, or 210 mm, or about 1.4 ns of round-trip time. The root-mean-square (RMS) range spread is then about 400 ps. To determine the distance to the reflector to 1 mm precision, or 7 ps, by averaging, the measurement needs at least (400/7)2 ≈ 3000 photons. This explains why a much larger system is needed to improve the existing measurements—the pre-APOLLO 2 cm RMS range precision required only about 10 photons, even at the worst-case orientation of the retroreflector array.

APOLLO attacks this problem by using both a bigger telescope and better astronomical seeing. Both are considerably improved over existing systems. Compared to McDonald Observatory ranging station, the Apache Point telescope has a factor of 20 greater light-collecting area. There is also a big gain from better seeing—the APO site and telescope combined can often achieve one arcsecond seeing, compared to the ≈5 arcseconds typical for the previous McDonald Lunar Ranging Station (MLRS). The better seeing helps two ways—it both increases the laser beam intensity on the Moon and reduces the lunar background, since a smaller receiver field-of-view may be used, gathering light from a smaller spot on the Moon. Both effects scale as the inverse square of the seeing, so that the signal-to-noise ratio of the lunar return is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the seeing. APOLLO should therefore gain about 20 (from the bigger telescope) × 25 (for better seeing) = 500 × in return signal strength over MLRS, and additional factor of 25 in signal-to-noise (from fewer stray photons interfering with the desired ones). Likewise APOLLO should get a signal about 50 times stronger than the OCA LLR facility, which has a 1.5 m telescope and seeing of about 3 arcsec.

The increased optical gain brings some problems due to the possibility of getting more than one returned photon per pulse. The most novel component of the APOLLO system is the integrated array of Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) used in the detector. This technology is needed to deal with multiple photon returns within each pulse. Most single photon detectors suffer from &quot;dead time&quot;: they cannot detect a photon if it arrives soon after another. This means that if more than one photon comes back in a single pulse, a conventional single-photon detector would only record the arrival time of the first photon. However, the important quantity is the centroid of the time of all returned photons (assuming the pulse and reflectors are symmetrical), so any system that can return multiple photons per pulse must record the arrival times of each photon. In APOLLO, the incoming photons are spread over an array of independent detectors, which reduces the chance that two or more photons hit any one of the detectors.

=== Modeling station locations ===

Any laser ranging station, APOLLO included, measures the transit time, and hence the distance, from the telescope to the reflector(s). But for lunar ranging science, what is really wanted is the distance between the center of mass of the Earth and the center of mass of the Moon. To do this, the positions of the telescope, and the reflectors, must be known to comparable precision (a few mm). Since both the telescope and the reflectors are stationary structures, it might seem they could be precisely measured, and then their position would be known thereafter. This assumption is not too bad for the Moon, which is a quiet environment. But for the Earth, the stations move quite a bit on this scale:
*The Earth&#x27;s polar axis moves and the Earth&#x27;s rotation is irregular. The polar axis moves due to various causes, some predictable (the Moon exerts a torque on Earth&#x27;s tidal bulge) and some variable (rocks are rebounding from the last ice age, weather). Weather also affects the Earth&#x27;s rotation, by moving large masses of water around. These effects, important to many other science projects as well, even have their own agency to keep track of them—the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.
*The stations move due to tides. The Moon, since it is tidally locked to the Earth, has relatively small and repeatable tides of about 10 cm. The solid Earth has larger tides, oscillating about 35 cm peak-to-peak, every 12 hours.
*The Earth&#x27;s crust changes in response to long term fluctuations such as post-glacial rebound and loading caused by sediment transport.
*The Earth&#x27;s short-term weather can also affect the location of the telescope, primarily vertically. Various weather effects can load local regions of the Earth&#x27;s crust, depressing the crust by a few millimeters. These effects come from the atmosphere (high pressure systems press on the Earth&#x27;s surface), and the ocean (water piles up on the coast depressing the crust). Ground water fluctuations, caused by rain, can also affect the telescope location.
*The pressure of sunlight pushes the Moon&#x27;s orbit slightly off center. This is a small effect, about 3.65 mm, but it is particularly important since it mimics the effect of an EP violation.
*Even continental drift must be compensated for.

In addition, the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere causes an additional delay, since the speed of light is slightly slower through the atmosphere. This amounts to about 1.6 meters when looking straight up at Apache Point. This delay is also affected by weather, primarily atmospheric pressure, which determines just how much air there is above the site.

Since many of these effects are weather-related, and also affect the more common satellite laser ranging, ranging stations traditionally include weather stations, measuring local temperature, pressure, and relative humidity. APOLLO will measure all these, plus measure local gravity very precisely, using a precision gravimeter. This instrument is capable of sensing vertical displacements as small as 0.1 mm, by measuring the change in gravity as the observatory moves closer to or farther from the Earth&#x27;s center.

Using all these measurements, scientists try to model and predict the exact location of the telescope, and the delays through the atmosphere, so they can compensate for them. The tides are fairly predictable, and the Earth&#x27;s rotation is measured by the IERS and can be accounted for. Atmospheric delay is fairly well understood, and is dominated by the pressure measurement alone.
Early models had uncertainties in the 5–10 mm range for reasonable elevation angles, though more recent efforts have produced a model claiming 3 mm accuracy down to 10 degrees above the horizon, and sub-millimeter performance above 20–30° elevation. The weather is perhaps the biggest error source. Atmospheric loading is estimated from the barometric pressure at the telescope and the average pressure within a radius. Ocean loading has been handled strictly by empirical models, and ground water has been largely ignored. APOLLO will probably require improvements in all these models to reach the full accuracy of the measurements.

== Discoveries ==
In April 2010, the APOLLO team announced that, with the aid of photos from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, they had found the long-lost Lunokhod 1 rover and had received returns from its laser retroreflector. By the fall of 2010, the location of the rover had been trilaterated (using range measurements from different points in the Earth&#x27;s rotation and the Moon&#x27;s libration) to about a centimeter. The location near the limb of the moon, combined with the ability to range the rover even when it is in sunlight, promises to be particularly useful for determining aspects of the Earth-Moon system.

The APOLLO collaboration has discovered that the optical efficiency of the lunar reflectors decreases at full moon. This effect was not present in measurements from the early 1970s, was visible but not strong in the 1980s, and is now quite significant; the signal is about 10-fold less during a full moon. The cause was suspected to be due to dust on the arrays, leading to temperature gradients, distorting the returned beam.
Measurements during the total lunar eclipse of December 2010 confirmed thermal effects as the cause. The sudden cut off and restoration of the light allowed thermal time constants of the effect to be observed.

== Status ==
APOLLO has been up and working to various degrees since October 2005, with science-quality data beginning April 2006. By mid-2011, the status was:
*All 5 reflectors (three Apollo and two Lunokhod) ranged routinely.
*As many as 12 photons in a single pulse (limited by detector – might have been more).
*Sustained rate of about 3 photons per pulse over several minutes. This is about 65 times more photons detected than previous efforts.
*As many as 50,000 return photons detected in a single lunation (during 5 hours total operation).

As of mid-2011, the range precision (per session) was believed to be about per reflector, while the orbit of the Moon is being determined to roughly the 15 mm level. The gap between the measurements and the theory could be due to systematic errors in the ranging, insufficient modeling of various conventional effects that become important at this level, or limitations of our theory of gravity. Although it is possible that this discrepancy is due to new physics, the primary suspect is insufficient modeling, since this is known to be both complex and difficult.

To enable APOLLO to improve beyond the part per trillion measurement accuracy level, in 2016 it added a cesium atomic clock and improved calibration system. With the new system in place, the possible accuracy can be increased to better than 2 mm.

The new system has confirmed the accuracy of previous measurements. It revealed that the previous estimate of 10 ps of error (corresponding to 1.5 mm of distance uncertainty) attributed to APOLLO&#x27;s GPS-synchronized oven-controlled crystal oscillator was too low; the true figure was closer to 20 ps (3 mm). However, careful record-keeping allowed the old data to be reanalyzed in light of the new understanding of the clock&#x27;s variations and most of the accuracy recovered.

By confirming the accuracy of previous measurements, and making new even more accurate measurements, the still unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment is now placed more firmly on the theoretical models.

<text>In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a reduction is an algorithm for transforming one problem into another problem. A sufficiently efficient reduction from one problem to another may be used to show that the second problem is at least as difficult as the first.

Intuitively, problem &quot;A&quot; is reducible to problem &quot;B&quot;, if an algorithm for solving problem &quot;B&quot; efficiently (if it existed) could also be used as a subroutine to solve problem &quot;A&quot; efficiently. When this is true, solving &quot;A&quot; cannot be harder than solving &quot;B&quot;. &quot;Harder&quot; means having a higher estimate of the required computational resources in a given context (e.g., higher time complexity, greater memory requirement, expensive need for extra hardware processor cores for a parallel solution compared to a single-threaded solution, etc.). The existence of a reduction from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; can be written in the shorthand notation &quot;A&quot; ≤m &quot;B&quot;, usually with a subscript on the ≤ to indicate the type of reduction being used (m : mapping reduction, p : polynomial reduction).

The mathematical structure generated on a set of problems by the reductions of a particular type generally forms a preorder, whose equivalence classes may be used to define degrees of unsolvability and complexity classes.

==Introduction==
There are two main situations where we need to use reductions:
* First, we find ourselves trying to solve a problem that is similar to a problem we&#x27;ve already solved. In these cases, often a quick way of solving the new problem is to transform each instance of the new problem into instances of the old problem, solve these using our existing solution, and then use these to obtain our final solution. This is perhaps the most obvious use of reductions.
* Second: suppose we have a problem that we&#x27;ve proven is hard to solve, and we have a similar new problem. We might suspect that it is also hard to solve. We argue by contradiction: suppose the new problem is easy to solve. Then, if we can show that &quot;every&quot; instance of the old problem can be solved easily by transforming it into instances of the new problem and solving those, we have a contradiction. This establishes that the new problem is also hard.

A very simple example of a reduction is from &quot;multiplication&quot; to &quot;squaring&quot;. Suppose all we know how to do is to add, subtract, take squares, and divide by two. We can use this knowledge, combined with the following formula, to obtain the product of any two numbers:

: formula_1

We also have a reduction in the other direction; obviously, if we can multiply two numbers, we can square a number. This seems to imply that these two problems are equally hard. This kind of reduction corresponds to Turing reduction.

However, the reduction becomes much harder if we add the restriction that we can only use the squaring function one time, and only at the end. In this case, even if we&#x27;re allowed to use all the basic arithmetic operations, including multiplication, no reduction exists in general, because in order to get the desired result as a square we have to compute its square root first, and this square root could be an irrational number like formula_2 that cannot be constructed by arithmetic operations on rational numbers. Going in the other direction, however, we can certainly square a number with just one multiplication, only at the end. Using this limited form of reduction, we have shown the unsurprising result that multiplication is harder in general than squaring. This corresponds to many-one reduction.

==Properties==
A reduction is a preordering, that is a reflexive and transitive relation, on P(N)×P(N), where P(N) is the power set of the natural numbers.

== Types and applications of reductions ==
As described in the example above, there are two main types of reductions used in computational complexity, the many-one reduction and the Turing reduction. Many-one reductions map &quot;instances&quot; of one problem to &quot;instances&quot; of another; Turing reductions &quot;compute&quot; the solution to one problem, assuming the other problem is easy to solve. The many-one reduction is a stronger type of Turing reduction, and is more effective at separating problems into distinct complexity classes. However, the increased restrictions on many-one reductions make them more difficult to find.

A problem is complete for a complexity class if every problem in the class reduces to that problem, and it is also in the class itself. In this sense the problem represents the class, since any solution to it can, in combination with the reductions, be used to solve every problem in the class.

However, in order to be useful, reductions must be &quot;easy&quot;. For example, it&#x27;s quite possible to reduce a difficult-to-solve NP-complete problem like the boolean satisfiability problem to a trivial problem, like determining if a number equals zero, by having the reduction machine solve the problem in exponential time and output zero only if there is a solution. However, this does not achieve much, because even though we can solve the new problem, performing the reduction is just as hard as solving the old problem. Likewise, a reduction computing a noncomputable function can reduce an undecidable problem to a decidable one. As Michael Sipser points out in &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Computation&quot;: &quot;The reduction must be easy, relative to the complexity of typical problems in the class [...] If the reduction itself were difficult to compute, an easy solution to the complete problem wouldn&#x27;t necessarily yield an easy solution to the problems reducing to it.&quot;

Therefore, the appropriate notion of reduction depends on the complexity class being studied. When studying the complexity class NP and harder classes such as the polynomial hierarchy, polynomial-time reductions are used. When studying classes within P such as NC and NL, log-space reductions are used. Reductions are also used in computability theory to show whether problems are or are not solvable by machines at all; in this case, reductions are restricted only to computable functions.

In case of optimization (maximization or minimization) problems, we often think in terms of approximation-preserving reduction. Suppose we have two optimization problems such that instances of one problem can be mapped onto instances of the other, in a way that nearly optimal solutions to instances of the latter problem can be transformed back to yield nearly optimal solutions to the former. This way, if we have an optimization algorithm (or approximation algorithm) that finds near-optimal (or optimal) solutions to instances of problem B, and an efficient approximation-preserving reduction from problem A to problem B, by composition we obtain an optimization algorithm that yields near-optimal solutions to instances of problem A. Approximation-preserving reductions are often used to prove hardness of approximation results: if some optimization problem A is hard to approximate (under some complexity assumption) within a factor better than α for some α, and there is a β-approximation-preserving reduction from problem A to problem B, we can conclude that problem B is hard to approximate within factor α/β.

==Examples==
* To show that a decision problem P is undecidable we must find a reduction from a decision problem which is already known to be undecidable to P. That reduction function must be a computable function. In particular, we often show that a problem P is undecidable by showing that the halting problem reduces to P.
* The complexity classes P, NP and PSPACE are closed under (many-one, &quot;Karp&quot;) polynomial-time reductions. 
* The complexity classes L, NL, P, NP and PSPACE are closed under log-space reduction.

===Detailed example===
The following example shows how to use reduction from the halting problem to prove that a language is undecidable. Suppose &quot;H&quot;(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) is the problem of determining whether a given Turing machine &quot;M&quot; halts (by accepting or rejecting) on input string &quot;w&quot;. This language is known to be undecidable. Suppose &quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is the problem of determining whether the language a given Turing machine &quot;M&quot; accepts is empty (in other words, whether &quot;M&quot; accepts any strings at all). We show that &quot;E&quot; is undecidable by a reduction from &quot;H&quot;.

To obtain a contradiction, suppose &quot;R&quot; is a decider for &quot;E&quot;. We will use this to produce a decider &quot;S&quot; for &quot;H&quot; (which we know does not exist). Given input &quot;M&quot; and &quot;w&quot; (a Turing machine and some input string), define &quot;S&quot;(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) with the following behavior: &quot;S&quot; creates a Turing machine &quot;N&quot; that accepts only if the input string to &quot;N&quot; is &quot;w&quot; and &quot;M&quot; halts on input &quot;w&quot;, and does not halt otherwise. The decider &quot;S&quot; can now evaluate &quot;R&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) to check whether the language accepted by &quot;N&quot; is empty. If &quot;R&quot; accepts &quot;N&quot;, then the language accepted by &quot;N&quot; is empty, so in particular &quot;M&quot; does not halt on input &quot;w&quot;, so &quot;S&quot; can reject. If &quot;R&quot; rejects &quot;N&quot;, then the language accepted by &quot;N&quot; is nonempty, so &quot;M&quot; does halt on input &quot;w&quot;, so &quot;S&quot; can accept. Thus, if we had a decider &quot;R&quot; for &quot;E&quot;, we would be able to produce a decider &quot;S&quot; for the halting problem &quot;H&quot;(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) for any machine &quot;M&quot; and input &quot;w&quot;. Since we know that such an &quot;S&quot; cannot exist, it follows that the language &quot;E&quot; is also undecidable.

<text>Margat, also known as Marqab (), is a castle near Baniyas, Syria, which was a Crusader fortress and one of the major strongholds of the Knights Hospitaller. It is located around from the Mediterranean coast and approximately south of Baniyas. The castle remained in a poor state of preservation until 2007 when some reconstruction and renovation began.

==Fortress==

===History===
Margat is located on a hill formed by an extinct volcano about above sea level on the road between Tripoli and Latakia, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.

According to Arab sources, the site of Margat Castle was first fortified in 1062 by Muslims who continued to hold it within the Christian Principality of Antioch in the aftermath of the First Crusade. When the Principality was defeated at the Battle of Harran in 1104, the Byzantine Empire took advantage of their weakness and captured Margat from the Muslims. A few years later it was captured by Tancred, Prince of Galilee, regent of Antioch, and became part of the Principality.

In the 1170s, it was controlled by Rainald II Masoir of Antioch as a vassal of the count of Tripoli. The fortress was so large that it had its own household officials and a number of rear-vassals. Rainald II&#x27;s son Bertrand sold it to the Hospitallers in 1186 as it was too expensive for the Mazoir family to maintain. After some rebuilding and expansion by the Hospitallers it became their headquarters in Syria. Under Hospitaller control, its fourteen towers were thought to be impregnable.

In 1188, Saladin marched on Margat having left Krak des Chevaliers in search of easier prey. According to Abu&#x27;l-Fida, &quot;Recognising that Maqab was impregnable and that he had no hope of capturing it, he passed on to Jabala&quot;. It was one of the few remaining territories left in Christian hands after Saladin&#x27;s conquests.

By the beginning of the 13th century the Hospitallers controlled the surrounding land and roads and made a large profit from travellers and pilgrims passing through. Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus was imprisoned there after Richard I of England captured Cyprus from him during the Third Crusade. The bishop of nearby Valenia also used Margat as his headquarters after around 1240. Margat was second in size and power only to the other Hospitaller fortress to the south, Krak des Chevaliers.
In September 1281, the Hospitallers of Margat dispatched a contingent of troops to support the Mongol invasion of Syria, which the Mamluk sultan of Egypt Qalawun successfully prevented after defeating the coalition at Homs. To punish the Hospitallers, Qalawun clandestinely raised an army in Damascus and besieged Margat on 17 April 1285. After a 38-day siege during which sappers and miners managed to dig several tunnels underneath the fortress&#x27;s walls, a mine destroyed a of the southernmost wall. The defenders panicked and on discovering the numerous tunnels around the fortress, surrendered to the Mamluk commander Fakhr al-Din Mukri on 23 May, with Qalwun entering Margat two days later. The siege was witnessed by eleven-year-old Abu&#x27;l Fida and his father, the Ayyubid governor of Hama. Qalawun allowed the Hospitallers to leave with everything they could carry. Rather than destroy Margat as he did with other fortresses, he repaired its defences and placed a strong garrison there due to its strategic value.

Marqat, known as &quot;Marqab&quot; by the Muslims, became a district of the Mamluk province of Tripoli with maintenance of the area financed by the sultan. Intrepid traveller Ibn Battuta visited the fortress and noted that a suburb was built outside of it for foreigners, who were not allowed entry into the fortress. The district governor based at the Marqab fortress held the military rank of &quot;Emir of 20 Mamluks.&quot; He was charged with defending the coast, particularly from threats from the island of Cyprus, and maintaining the guard towers and observation posts. During the Burji Mamluk period, Margat was well known in the region for containing an imperial prison with many high-profile inmates. The 15th-century Muslim historian Khalil al-Zahiri noted that Marqab fortress was among the most important sites of Tripoli province. Marqab was &quot;clearly impregnable and controls a territory containing numerous villages.&quot;

During the Ottoman era, Margat became the administrative center of a &quot;kaza&quot; (&quot;district&quot;) of the same name, which contained three &quot;nahiyas&quot; (&quot;subdistricts&quot;) — Margat, Qadmus and Khawabi. In the 1890s there was a total of 393 localities with a collective population of 39,671, of whom 21,121 were Alawites. The chief agricultural products were olives, onions, tobacco and silk, which were largely marketed to Beirut-based merchants. The fortress served as the residence of the kaymakam (&quot;military governor&quot;) of the district until 1884 when the seat was transferred to Baniyas.

The last known owner of the castle was Al-Markabi family (“Al-Marqabi”) where the name was based on the castle. In 2023, the castle was damaged during the February earthquake.

===Architecture===
Castles in Europe provided lordly accommodation for their owners and acted as centres of administration. In the Levant the need for defence was paramount and this was reflected in castle design. Historian Hugh Kennedy suggests that &quot;The castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its apogee in great buildings like Margat and Crac des Chevaliers.&quot; Like the Krak des Chevaliers, Margat is a large spur castle with many typical elements of a concentric castle. It has a bent entrance leading through the base of a gate tower. A notable feature of the inner defences is a large circular tower, sometimes referred to as a donjon (though it should not be confused with a central keep). Unlike the Krak Des Chevaliers, Margat has a large outer ward, giving it a larger total area.

==Village of al-Marqab==
The village of al-Marqab () is located just north of the castle, straddling the road leading north to the coastal city of Baniyas. Nearby localities besides Baniyas, include Talin to the east, Osaibah to the southeast with Basatin al-Assad and al-Bayda to the south. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), al-Marqab had a population of 2,618 as of the 2004 census. Its inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims. Together, al-Marqab, Basatin al-Assad and al-Bayda form a mostly Sunni Muslim-inhabited enclave in an area largely populated by members of the Alawite community.

A suburb has existed outside the fortress since at least the late 12th century, during Crusader rule. During this period, its chief exports were sumac, wine, must, almonds, figs and pottery. In 1325 North African geographer Ibn Batuta visited the suburb. In 1938 al-Marqab stood near the foot of the fortress and was among five Sunni Muslim villages in the area, which also contained several Alawite, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic and Maronite villages. In 1945, at the end of the French Mandate, al-Marqab had a population of 832. Starting in 1968, it experienced significant prosperity due to the construction of the Iraq Petroleum Company pipeline and petroleum port at Baniyas.

<doc id="848071" wikidata="Q452581" url="?curid=848071" title="List of rulers of Asante">
<text>The is the title for the monarch of the historical Ashanti Empire as well as the ceremonial ruler of the Ashanti people today. The Ashanti royal house traces its line to the Oyoko (an &quot;Abusua&quot;, or &quot;clan&quot;) Abohyen Dynasty of Nana Twum and the Oyoko Dynasty of Osei Tutu Opemsoo, who formed the Empire of Ashanti in 1701 and was crowned Asantehene (King of all Asante). Osei Tutu held the throne until his death in battle in 1717, and was the sixth king in Ashanti royal history.

The Asantehene is the ruler of the Ashanti people. The Asantehene is traditionally enthroned on a golden stool known as the &quot;Sika &#x27;dwa&quot;, and the office is sometimes referred to by this name. The Asantehene is also the titular ruler of Kumasi, which served as the capital of the Ashanti Empire and today, the Ashanti Region. The Ashanti Empire comprised parts of present-day southern Ghana and portions of present-day eastern Côte d&#x27;Ivoire between the 17th and 20th centuries.

The current Asantehene is Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II, born Nana Kwaku Dua, who ascended as the 16th Asante king in April 1999. Osei Tutu II was one of seven descendants who were eligible to the heir presumptive.

==Elections and regents==
During the period between the death of an Asantehene and the election of a successor, the Mamponghene, the Asantehene&#x27;s deputy, acts as a regent. This policy was only changed during a time of civil war in the late 19th century, when the &quot;Kwasafomanhyiamu&quot; or governing council itself ruled as regent. The succession is decided by a series of councils of Asante nobles and other royal family members.

==The colonial era and Asante independence==
The Ashanti Confederacy was made a British protectorate in 1902, and the office of Asantehene was discontinued. In 1926, the British permitted the repatriation of Prempeh I – whom they had exiled to the Seychelles in 1896 – and allowed him to adopt the title Kumasehene, but not Asantehene. However, in 1935, the British finally granted the Ashanti moderated self-rule as the Kingdom of Ashanti, and the title of Asantehene was revived.

==List of rulers==
All rulers in the lists below were members of the Oyoko Abohyen Dynasty.

===Kwaamanhene of the Kwaaman State===
===Kumasehene of the Kumaseman State===


===Asantehene of the Kingdom of Ashanti (Ashanti Empire)===
All regents were members of the Oyoko Dynasty who were and still are the holders of the title Mamponghene. Upon the death of the Asantehene, it is the task of the Mamponghene to act as the regent, or &quot;Awisiahene&quot;.

<text>The University of Michigan–Dearborn (UM-Dearborn) is a public university in Dearborn, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1959 with a gift from the Ford Motor Company, it was initially known as the Dearborn Center, operating as a remote branch of the University of Michigan. Upon receiving its own accreditation in 1970, the branch became a fully-fledged university and subsequently changed its name to the University of Michigan–Dearborn. It continues to adhere to the policies of the University of Michigan Board of Regents without having a separate governing board.

The university is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research spending and doctorate production&quot; in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as of the 2025 update.
Located in Metro Detroit, UM-Dearborn is also known for its community engagement within the region. Together with Oakland University, the University of Michigan-Flint, and Wayne State University, UM-Dearborn is one of the four Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities (CUMU) members in the State of Michigan.

The university&#x27;s athletic teams are the Michigan-Dearborn Wolverines. They primarily compete in the Wolverine–Hoosier Athletic Conference. The University of Michigan-Dearborn Fieldhouse, opened in 1978, serves as the home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. Notable alumni include the former COO of Ford Motor Company Kumar Galhotra, former chair of the Michigan Republican Party Saul Anuzis, and former member of the Michigan House of Representatives George Darany.

==History==

===Dearborn Center of the University of Michigan===

The story of UM-Dearborn begins with in the mid-1950s with Archie Pearson, the director of training at Ford Motor Company. Pearson conducted studies that revealed a looming shortage of college-educated engineers and junior administrators within the company&#x27;s future workforce. As a result, Pearson discreetly reached out to higher education institutions in Metro Detroit, inquiring about their willingness to adapt their programs to align with the anticipated requirements of the automotive industry.

On December 17, 1956, the Ford Motor Company gifted both land and capital development funds to the Regents for the creation of a remote branch of the university offering upper-division undergraduate and master&#x27;s level programs. In February 1957, the Regents of the University of Michigan officially accepted the gifts and committed to establishing a branch in Dearborn known as the Dearborn Center of the University of Michigan. 

The Dearborn Center would also have a cooperative work-study requirement for its programs in business administration and engineering, which were intended to provide students with real-world experience that would increase their employment prospects. The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor would provide the necessary liberal arts and professional courses to complete a University of Michigan bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree. Construction on the Dearborn Center began on May 22, 1958, and on October 1 of that year, William E. Stirton was appointed its first director.

The branch opened with an enrollment of 34 students on September 28, 1959. A liberal arts division and programs in electrical engineering and teacher education were added in fall 1960. The first 12 graduates on January 20, 1962. In 1963, the branch was renamed the Dearborn Campus of the University of Michigan, to emphasize that it was a free-standing unit of the university.

In May 1969, the Dearborn Campus Planning Study Committee released their report on the future of the institution, which recommended the addition of lower-division undergraduate courses and the expansion of non-cooperative programs. In November 1969, the regents formally approved the committee&#x27;s recommendations. 

=== Proposal for an independent &quot;Fairlane University&quot; ===

In February 1970, the Committee on Colleges and Universities of the Michigan House of Representatives discussed a bill to separate the Dearborn campus from the University of Michigan, proposing its establishment as an independent institution named &quot;Fairlane University.&quot; This initiative, reflecting a national trend toward expanding higher education, faced strong opposition from faculty and students in Dearborn, leading to its eventual failure.

In the same year, Oakland University gained institutional independence from Michigan State University, evolving into an autonomous research university. Meanwhile, the Dearborn campus continued to grow under the policies of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, receiving independent accreditation in August 1970 and officially being renamed in April 1971. However, this continued affiliation with the University of Michigan would prevent this newly fledged university from having its own governing board.

This period of proposed restructuring was not unique to Michigan. In 1972, a similar process occurred in Virginia, where George Mason College was separated from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and renamed George Mason University.

=== University of Michigan–Dearborn ===

====Leonard E. Goodall (1971 until 1979)====

In August 1970, the Dearborn campus received its first accreditation independent from the Ann Arbor campus, from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In April 1971, it was officially renamed the University of Michigan–Dearborn (UM–Dearborn). In July of that year, Leonard E. Goodall, the vice-chancellor of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, was appointed UM–Dearborn&#x27;s first chancellor. In the fall of 1971, the university officially became a four-year institution as it welcomed its first freshman class. There were 313 freshmen in that first class and overall enrollment grew by 50% to 1,369. University enrollment grew rapidly during the course of the decade, exceeding 6,000 in 1979. UM–Dearborn announced both a $19 million campus development plan and the creation of its Alumni Society in November 1973.

Between 1978 and 1980, three major new buildings were opened on campus: the Fieldhouse and Ice Arena, the University Library, and the University Mall. These additions caused the center of campus to shift south of UM–Dearborn&#x27;s original four buildings. 

====William A. Jenkins (1980 until 1988)====

In July 1980, University of Colorado Denver acting chancellor William A. Jenkins was named the second chancellor of UM–Dearborn. He soon faced a major financial crisis on campus that stemmed from a recession in the state, which resulted in a $500,000 cut from the university&#x27;s base budget in April 1981. Also in 1981, history professor Sidney Bolkosky established the Holocaust Survivor Oral History Project at UM–Dearborn. In the fall of 1983, minority enrollment on campus reached a record high of 9.6%. The university received a 13.2% increase in its annual appropriation from the state legislature in 1984–85, which enabled it to restore the 3% salary raises that it had cut in 1981–82. In May 1986, UM–Dearborn opened its Armenian Research Center, the first university-affiliated institution of its kind.

====Blenda J. Wilson (1988 until 1992)====

In November 1988, Blenda Wilson was inaugurated as the third chancellor of UM–Dearborn. In September 1989, the university began its $11.6 million General Campus Renovation Project, entirely funded by the State of Michigan. In summer 1990, the university terminated its varsity ice hockey program, resulting in head coach Tom Anastos and athletic director Sid Fox announcing their departures from Dearborn. In October, Wilson announced that hockey would become a club sport and the university&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s volleyball teams would compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). In April 1991, graduate enrollment at UM–Dearborn exceeded 1,000 for the first time, and in July of that year revenue from tuition surpassed state appropriations. In May 1992, Wilson announced her resignation to take a position at California State University. 

====James C. Renick (1993 until 1999)====

In January 1993, James C. Renick was inaugurated as the university&#x27;s fourth chancellor. In fall 1995 and again in fall 1996, the university achieved new total enrollment records (8,214 and 8,324, respectively). In March 1997, UM–Dearborn inaugurated the first graduate program in its College of Arts, Sciences, &amp; Letters (CASL), a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies degree. In March 1999, the university&#x27;s FUTURES Planning Resource Council released its recommendation that UM–Dearborn&#x27;s &quot;top priority is being nationally regarded as an excellent regional university&quot; and argued this should be achieved by &quot;developing interdisciplinary centers of teaching and research excellence&quot;.

====Daniel E. Little (2000 until 2018)====

In November 2000, Daniel E. Little was inaugurated as the university&#x27;s fifth chancellor. In 2001, both the Environmental Interpretive Center and the CASL Building were opened on campus. In fall of 2003, university enrollment topped 9,000 for the first time (9,022) and graduate enrollment reached 25% of total enrollment. In September of that year, the university acquired the Fairlane Training Center from Ford, located across Evergreen Road from its main campus, which it renamed the Fairlane Center in February 2004. In November 2003, the renovated University Center (formerly the University Mall) was opened. In October 2006, UM–Dearborn dedicated its new Science Learning and Research Center. In November 2008, the Regents of the University of Michigan approved the first doctoral programs at UM–Dearborn, Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in Automotive Systems Engineering and Information Systems Engineering, both to begin the following fall. In February 2009, the regents approved a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) program. In May of that year, they announced the renaming of the School of Management as the College of Business. In 2008, Kiplinger ranked UM–Dearborn 86th nationally in its &quot;Best Values in Public Colleges&quot;, while in 2009 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked it the fourth-best master&#x27;s-level university in the Midwest.

In September 2013, The Union at Dearborn opened, with its 145 apartments providing the first on-campus student housing since the 1970s. Also that month, UM–Dearborn&#x27;s School of Education was renamed the College of Education, Health and Human Services. In December 2015, UM–Dearborn conferred its 50,000 cumulative degree. In September 2016, the university&#x27;s Natural Sciences Building reopened after a $51 million renovation. In April 2018, UM–Dearborn broke ground on a new, $90 million Engineering Lab Building. In 2018, Daniel E. Little resigned as chancellor. 

====Domenico Grasso (2018 until present)====

In August 2018, Domenico Grasso was inaugurated as university&#x27;s sixth chancellor.

==Campus==

The UM–Dearborn campus is located on the former estate of Henry Ford. It is divided into several sections: The Henry Ford Estate, known as Fair Lane, The Fairlane Center, Main Campus, and the Early Childhood Education Center just south of campus. In addition, the university has over 70 acres (283,000 m2) of nature preserve and a bird observatory, the Rouge River Bird Observatory, which has operated on campus since its founding in 1992, and is the longest-running, full-time urban bird research station in North America.

Main Campus includes the facilities for the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters (CASL), the College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS), the Environmental Interpretive Center, Administration, the Mardigian Library, the Institute for Advanced Vehicle Studies, the University Center, the Computing Building, and the Fieldhouse. Within both CASL and CECS, many different buildings house different programs, departments, research centers, student life centers, and academic resources.

Fair Lane and the nature preserve west of campus are along the Rouge River. There is a small waterfall, rose garden, meadow, a lake, and reflecting pond surrounded by acres of forest. The forest has many walking paths which connect the Environmental Interpretive Center, Henry Ford Community College, Downtown West Dearborn, Hines Drive, the university&#x27;s Main Campus, and Fair Lane together. Fair Lane recently has been handed over to Edsel and Eleanor Ford House. The Edsel Ford Estate will put forth restoration efforts which will cost 50 million dollars or more. The majority of the funding will go towards full home restoration and grounds preservation. The project will open up rooms which had been unavailable to public tours before.

== Organization ==
=== Administration ===


UM-Dearborn, historically a branch of the University of Michigan, has operated under the policies of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan since its accreditation in 1970. The Board of Regents, as the governing body, is responsible for the appointment of the university president, who presides over the Board&#x27;s meetings but does not have voting rights. Instead of directly managing the university&#x27;s operations, the university president recommends the appointment of a chancellor, who is subject to approval by the Board of Regents and is tasked with overseeing the day-to-day administrative duties of the university as its chief executive officer.

<text>CarnEvil is a 1998 light-gun shooter arcade game released by Midway Games. It is often noted for its heavy use of graphic violence and dark humor. Despite it being Midway Games&#x27; most successful light gun shooter, it has never been released on home consoles.

==Gameplay==

&quot;CarnEvil&quot; is a light-gun shooter game in which the player, as an unnamed teenage everyman, must clear four levels by eliminating waves of various gruesome creatures such as evil clowns, sideshow freaks and Krampus&#x27;s elves. The first three levels can be played in any order with no effect on the gameplay, with the fourth level being accessed upon their completion. Each level opens with a sardonic greeting from Umlaut, a floating jester skull who serves as the game&#x27;s host.

The cabinet comes with two pump action shotguns that can be reloaded by either physically cocking the gun or pulling the trigger off-screen. The gun fires single shots much like a pistol, and most of the enemy characters are dispatched in four shots. The player can temporarily upgrade their gun by shooting bullet-shaped symbols, granting it the quality of a shotgun, machine gun, flamethrower, or acid rounds. Enemy attacks drain the player&#x27;s health, which can be replenished by shooting heart-shaped symbols.

The player&#x27;s score is displayed on the upper side of the screen and is constantly updated. Extra points can be earned by eliminating enemies attempting to victimize the non-player character Betty. However, if Betty is shot instead, the player incurs a health penalty. When a level is cleared, shooting accuracy percentages are displayed for the players. Upon the conclusion of a playthrough, top scorers can use the shotgun to write their initials or name, which will be displayed in a high score table.

==Plot==

In the fictional town of Greely Valley, Iowa, an urban legend claims that if a golden token is inserted into the mouth of Umlaut, a jester&#x27;s skull on top of the gravestone of a ringmaster named Professor Ludwig von Tökkentäkker, his haunted carnival will rise from the earth. As a group of teenagers take a hayride tour through the Greely Valley cemetery, the unnamed protagonist separates from the tour and approaches Tökkentäkker&#x27;s tombstone to find a golden coin sitting in its slot. The protagonist inserts the coin into Umlaut&#x27;s mouth, resulting in the haunted amusement park rising from the ground. Trapped within, he takes a shotgun from the shooting gallery and uses it to fight off hordes of zombies and other undead monsters in order to escape. After fighting through the Haunted House, Rickety Town and the Freak Show, he enters the and fights his way through in order to face Tökkentäkker directly aboard his airship.

Soon after killing Tökkentäkker, the protagonist falls from the airship as it explodes. In the morning, he and the only other survivor, Betty, wake up in front of the tombstone, where the token falls back into its slot. The protagonist re-inserts it into Umlaut&#x27;s mouth, causing him to laugh wickedly as Betty screams in horror.

==Development and release==
&quot;CarnEvil&quot; was conceptualized by Jack Haeger in 1988 when he was working on the video game &quot;Narc&quot;. As part of the development team&#x27;s experiments with live digitized footage for video games, Haegar began working with stop motion puppets in an attempt to recreate a cinematic experience. Haegar was fond of the classic horror movie premise of a teenager daring a friend to run through a graveyard, and sketched a concept piece based on this idea titled &quot;Horror Show&quot;. The sketch, primarily depicting a decrepit haunted house, featured a poster with the &quot;CarnEvil&quot; name and a prototypical version of Umlaut named &quot;Smeek&quot;. Although Haeger was aware that technical limitations at the time made the concept impractical, he saw potential in the &quot;dark carnival&quot; theme.

Midway Games approved Haeger&#x27;s concept following the successful releases of the light-gun shooters &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) and &quot;Revolution X&quot; (1994), which Haegar co-directed. The game originally had a tone similar to The Haunted Mansion, and featured an old caretaker character with a Punch and Judy-style puppet. After this version was harshly reviewed by Midway&#x27;s management, the development team revamped the concept with characters that were more aggressive and darkly humorous. This tone was set by Haeger&#x27;s conceptual character Hambone, a large brute with a goaltender mask and a gatling gun arm who would become the miniboss of the Haunted House stage. Over 40 characters were created and modeled in 3D Studio Max. Artist and 3D modeler Scott Pikulski recalled that &quot;Many ideas for characters and level content came from us just joking around while working on the game. It always felt like the project would be cancelled at any time, so we worked on it like we had nothing to lose. Jack has a great sense of humor, and many of the great ideas came from his head&quot;.

The spindly, angular qualities of Haeger&#x27;s concept sketches were influenced by &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, while the expressive and disturbing qualities of the characters&#x27; faces were inspired by a black-and-white photobook titled &quot;Fellini&#x27;s Faces&quot;. The &quot;Avengers&quot; episode &quot;Look — (Stop Me If You&#x27;ve Heard This One) — But There Were These Two Fellers...&quot;, which features a pair of murderous clowns, was also an influence. The fatalities in Midway&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; pushed the development team to increase the game&#x27;s graphic violence, with Pikulski responsible for many of the game&#x27;s goriest effects. However, in response to objections from potential distributors, the development team installed a DIP switch that would allow operators to replace the giant infant boss character Junior with a giant teddy bear character named Deaddy. The opening and closing cutscenes were created by Blur Studio under the direction of Tim Miller. The music and sound effects were created by Kevin Quinn. Haeger voiced the game&#x27;s opening narration as well as the characters Umlaut, Tökkentäkker, Hambone and Krampus. The enemy character Muertito the Bat Boy was created and voiced by artist Martin Martinez.

In September 1998, &quot;CarnEvil&quot; was showcased at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association Expo in Nashville, Tennessee. It was released on Halloween 1998, and it was considered a competitor to Atari Games&#x27;s &quot;Area 51: Site 4&quot; and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Time Crisis II&quot;. In 1999, Midway confirmed that the game would not be ported to consoles.

==Reception and legacy==
Mark Hain of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the game&#x27;s visuals and comfortable pump action gun, but was disappointed by the lack of extra gameplay features and hidden background secrets compared to Atari Games&#x27; &quot;Area 51&quot; and &quot;Maximum Force&quot;. Jason Wilson and Tyrone Rodriguez of &quot;Tips &amp; Tricks&quot; also praised the graphics, writing that &quot;the stunning 3D environments are portrayed in such gruesome detail, you will think you&#x27;re trapped in a horror film&quot;. French magazine &quot;Player One&quot; gave the game a score of 69%, regarding it as a &quot;House of the Dead&quot; clone, but commending the gun&#x27;s design and precision as well as the gory graphics. Adam Bregman of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; proclaimed &quot;CarnEvil&quot; to be &quot;undoubtedly the best of the genre&quot; and &quot;perhaps the most twisted video game ever created&quot;.

According to Haeger, the game&#x27;s sales exceeded those of &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;, which encouraged Midway&#x27;s arcade team to conceptualize a 4D ride adaptation that ultimately never materialized. &quot;CarnEvil&quot; was never ported to home consoles despite the success of &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Time Crisis&quot; and &quot;Point Blank&quot; on those platforms. Pikulski claimed that a developer had intended to create an original home console game that bore the &quot;CarnEvil&quot; title. Bregman observed that by July 1999, the game had disappeared from most Los Angeles County arcades, which he attributed to the game&#x27;s perverse presentation.

In September 2015, the fansite &quot;Greely Valley Cemetery&quot; was created as an archive for the game&#x27;s concept sketches, promotional art, music tracks and voice clips. Lucas Sullivan of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; considered &quot;Killing Floor&quot; and its sequel to be spiritual successors to &quot;CarnEvil&quot;, and he saw a thematic influence on the &quot;Loony Park&quot; level in &quot;Painkiller&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Battle Out of Hell&quot; expansion pack and &quot;Until Dawn: Rush of Blood&quot;.

<doc id="848100" wikidata="Q4970538" url="?curid=848100" title="British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983">
<text>The British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983 (1983 c. 6) is an Act of Parliament passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 28 March 1983. The purpose of the Act was to grant British citizenship to residents of the Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic.

Under the British Nationality Act 1981, a resident of the Falkland Islands was classed as a British Dependent Territories citizen (BDTCs) unless they also had a connection with the United Kingdom (UK) itself (such as through having a UK-born parent or grandparent). British Dependent Territories citizens were restricted in their right to enter and stay in the UK. The new Act conferred full British citizenship on the residents of the Falkland Islands, giving them more preferential status than that of other BDTCs, including BDTCs of Gibraltar (whose British citizenship must be voluntarily applied for). The 1983 Act had retrospective effect from 1 January 1983, the date on which the 1981 Act had come into effect.

The 1983 Act was passed mainly in response to the Falklands War, which was fought between the United Kingdom and Argentina over the sovereignty of the islands. The United Kingdom maintained that it would stand by the principle of self-determination of allowing the Falkland Islanders to decide their own destiny. It had been argued that the British Nationality Act 1981 had indicated British reluctance to hold the islands, as the residents were not legally full British citizens, and after the war ended in victory for the British, the 1983 Act was passed to clarify the United Kingdom&#x27;s commitment to the islands.

The Act has been largely superseded by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, which granted full British citizenship to BDTCs of most remaining British overseas territories.

<text>&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; is a charity song written in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia. It was first recorded by Band Aid, a supergroup assembled by Geldof and Ure consisting of popular British and Irish musical acts. It was recorded in a single day at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, in November 1984.

&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was released in the UK on 7 December 1984. It entered the UK singles chart at number one, where it remained for five weeks, becoming Christmas number one. It sold a million copies in the first week, making it the fastest-selling single in UK chart history until Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;. UK sales passed three million on the last day of 1984. The song also reached number one in 13 other countries. In the US, it fell short of the top ten in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 due to a lack of airplay, but sold an estimated 2.5 million copies by 1985. It had sold 11.7 million copies worldwide by 1989 and 3.8 million in the UK by 2017.

&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; raised £8 million for Ethiopia within a year, far exceeding Geldof&#x27;s hopes. The success led to several other charity singles, such as &quot;We Are the World&quot; (1985) by USA for Africa, and spin-off charity events, such as Comic Relief and the 1985 Live Aid concert. Some critics objected to its depiction of Ethiopia and Africa as barren. Ure said the song was secondary to the purpose of raising money for the cause.

&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was rerecorded and rereleased in 1989, 2004 and 2014. The 1989 and 2004 versions also raised funds for famine relief, while the 2014 version raised funds for the Ebola crisis in West Africa. All three reached number one in the UK, and the 1989 and 2004 versions became Christmas number ones. The 2004 version sold 1.8 million copies. A new mix, combining elements of the previous versions, was released in 2024 for the 40th anniversary.

==Background==
&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was inspired by a series of reports made by the BBC journalist Michael Buerk in 1984, which drew attention to the famine in Ethiopia. The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk&#x27;s report on 23 October describing it as &quot;a biblical famine in the 20th century&quot; and &quot;the closest thing to hell on Earth&quot;. The report featured the nurse Claire Bertschinger, who had to choose which children would receive the limited amount of food at the feeding station and who were too sick to be saved. The reports shocked the UK, motivating the British people to inundate relief agencies, such as Save the Children, with donations. The Boomtown Rats singer Bob Geldof and his partner, the television presenter Paula Yates, watched the broadcast on 23 October and were deeply affected by it. Geldof said about Bertschinger: &quot;In her was vested the power of life and death. She had become godlike, and that is unbearable for anyone.&quot;

On 2 November, Yates was in the Tyne Tees studio in Newcastle upon Tyne, where she was presenting the weekly live music show &quot;The Tube&quot;. Among the acts performing were Ultravox, promoting their greatest hits album &quot;The Collection&quot;. The singer, Midge Ure, was chatting to Yates in the dressing room when Geldof called her. Geldof had worked with Ure at the 1981 charity benefit show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball.&quot; Geldof asked to speak to Ure and told him that he wanted to do something to alleviate the suffering in Ethiopia. He and Ure arranged to discuss ideas over lunch the following Monday, 5 November, and decided to make a charity record.

Geldof began recruiting musicians. He called Sting and Simon Le Bon, who agreed to participate along with the rest of Duran Duran, and recruited Spandau Ballet after a chance meeting with the band&#x27;s guitarist Gary Kemp at an antiques shop in London. Geldof said: &quot;It suddenly it hit me. I thought, &#x27;Christ, we have got the real top boys here&#x27;, all the big names in pop are suddenly ready and willing to do this... I knew then that we were off, and I just decided to go for all the rest of the faces and started to ring everyone up, asking them to do it.&quot; Further phone calls from Geldof also secured promises of everybody involved to provide their services free of charge. Other contributors included UK music magazines, which donated advertising space to promote the single; Geldof&#x27;s record label Phonogram, which released the single; their parent company PolyGram, which distributed it; and the artist Peter Blake, who created the single&#x27;s sleeve.

==Composition==

Geldof&#x27;s and Ure&#x27;s biggest challenge was to write a song that could be recorded and released in time for Christmas. To avoid having to pay royalties, which would diminish the amount raised for charity, they wrote an original song rather than record a cover version. Ure wrote what he felt was a Christmas-like melody on a portable keyboard. He sent a tape to Geldof, who sarcastically told him that it sounded like the theme to the television series &quot;Z-Cars&quot;.

Geldof came to Ure&#x27;s house the next day and they worked on the song with Geldof on acoustic guitar. Geldof added lyrics based on a song he had originally written for the Boomtown Rats, which he had provisionally titled &quot;It&#x27;s My World&quot;. Ure recorded Geldof and his guitar and used the recording to develop Geldof&#x27;s ideas in his home studio, adding his own melody as a chorus. He was unable to improve on Geldof&#x27;s lyrics, with the exception of the line &quot;And there won&#x27;t be snow in Africa this Christmas time&quot;. The original lyric substituted &quot;Africa&quot; with &quot;Ethiopia&quot;, but Ure decided &quot;Ethiopia&quot; had too many syllables to fit the melody.

Geldof asked Trevor Horn to produce the song. Horn was an in-demand producer, having produced three number-one singles that year for Frankie Goes to Hollywood. He was receptive but said he would need at least six weeks, which would make it impossible to release by Christmas. However, he allowed the team to use his studios, Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, free for 24 hours on 25 November. Horn later remixed and co-produced the 12&quot; version and remixed it for the 1985 rerelease.

== Artists ==
While Ure was creating the backing track, Geldof contacted various artists, hoping to have the biggest names in British and Irish music appear. Those who were unable to appear, such as David Bowie and Paul McCartney, sent recorded messages of support that appeared on the B-side. The Thompson Twins, who were out of the country instead donated part of the proceeds of their single &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; to the Action for Ethiopia charity. Geldof said only three people refused to be involved, but refused to disclose who.

Members of the US group Kool &amp; the Gang appeared because they were signed to the same record label as the Boomtown Rats, and happened to be visiting Phonogram&#x27;s London offices on the day that Geldof proposed the single. Geldof invited Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt of the band Status Quo, to take part. Although Status Quo were from a different musical background and era, he felt their fame and consistent success would add credibility and their large fanbase would add to the sales. Geldof called Boy George, at the time one of the biggest music stars in the world, repeatedly in New York the day before the recording to insist that he attend. George took the last Concorde flight of the day and arrived at Sarm West at 6pm. He went immediately into the recording booth to deliver his lines, the last solo artist of the day. The singer Marilyn, who had achieved hit singles in 1983 but whose career had declined in 1984, arrived at the recording session uninvited, sensing an opportunity for publicity. Geldof and Ure felt any publicity was good publicity and accepted the additional star.

==Recording==
&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was produced by Ure. He spent several days in his home studio with his engineer, Rik Walton, creating the backing track, programming the keyboards and drum machines. For the intro, he used a sample of the drums from the 1983 track &quot;The Hurting&quot; by Tears for Fears. John Taylor of Duran Duran and Paul Weller visited Ure&#x27;s studio the day before the recording to add bass guitar and lead guitar. Ure and Weller later agreed that the guitar did not fit and did not use it. Ure sang the guide vocal, and Simon Le Bon and Sting came to Ure&#x27;s studio to record their parts.

Geldof and Ure arrived at Sarm West Studios at around 8am on Sunday 25 November with the media in attendance outside. With recording scheduled to begin at 10:30am, the artists began arriving. Geldof gave the newspaper &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; exclusive access in the studio, and had a group photograph taken by the newspaper&#x27;s photographer Brian Aris before recording, knowing it would appear in the following day&#x27;s edition and create publicity. The actor Nigel Planer, who had reached number two earlier in the year with a cover version of &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot; in the guise of his character Neil from the comedy series &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, also arrived uninvited. He performed in character as Neil to the camera. 

Ure played the backing track and guide vocals to the artists. As a way of having everyone involved immediately, he recorded the climax first. The artists were put in a huge group and sang the refrain &quot;Feed the world, let them know it&#x27;s Christmas time again&quot; until it was complete. Ure chose Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet to be the first singer to record his solo part. Hadley said this had been nerve-wracking, knowing that all his contemporaries were watching him. One by one the other assigned singers then did likewise, with Ure taping their efforts and then making notes on which segments would be cut into the final recording. Le Bon, despite having already recorded his part at Ure&#x27;s house, re-recorded it so he could be part of the moment. Sting also recorded his words again, this time to provide harmony vocals. Despite being singers, Geldof and Ure decided that they would not sing any solo lines, although they took part in the &quot;feed the world&quot; finale. Ure wrote in his autobiography that he was constantly battling with Geldof, and telling him to leave when he would come into the production booth and wrongly tell artists what to sing.

Ure planned Rossi and Parfitt to sing the &quot;here&#x27;s to you&quot; harmonies in the bridge, but Parfitt could not reach the high notes, and so the part was sung by Weller, Sting and Glenn Gregory. Rossi privately told Ure afterwards that in the studio he sang most of Status Quo&#x27;s vocal parts and that Parfitt only usually sang onstage, and that Ure should have kept Parfitt away from the microphone. Parfitt said later that he and Rossi had been extremely hungover, and were in no fit state to attempt to record their vocals. According to the journalist Robin Eggar, the only journalist present throughout the recording, Rossi and Parfitt supplied cocaine and the session &quot;became a party&quot;.
Phil Collins arrived with his entire drum kit to record a live drum track on top of the programmed drum machine. He set up the kit and then waited until early evening, after all the vocals had been recorded. Ure was content with the first take, but Collins asked to record a second take, which he was satisfied with. Boy George, who arrived that evening from New York City, was the last to record his part.

Ure began working on the mix as the participants began to party in the studio. Horn produced a B-side, &quot;Feed the World&quot;, using the instrumental track and featuring messages from artists who had been at the recording who had been unable to attend, including David Bowie, Paul McCartney, the members of Big Country and Holly Johnson from Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Before departing the Sarm Studio, Geldof recorded a statement, which featured as the last message on &quot;Feed the World&quot;. Geldof&#x27;s spoken-word statement said:

==Musical style==
&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; comprises a verse and bridge, which allow individual singers to perform different lines, and a chorus in the form of two repeated phrases performed by ensemble. The first line is sung by Paul Young on the 1984 version, Kylie Minogue on the 1989 version, Chris Martin of Coldplay on the 2004 version, and One Direction on the 2014 version. The opening line was sung by David Bowie at the Live Aid concert in 1985.

==Release and promotion==
The day after recording, Geldof appeared on Mike Read&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show to promote the record and promised that every penny would go to the cause. Most retailers agreed to sell the record at its cost price of £1.35 including VAT: however, some refused, citing cost pressures. The British government donated an amount to the charity equal to the amount of tax they had collected on the single.

Radio 1 began to play the song every hour, far greater than the seven or eight plays per day normally received by an A-list single. The number-one single at the time of its release was &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; by Jim Diamond. The song had advance orders of 250,000 within a week of its recording, and orders from record dealers reached one million by 8 December. To meet demand, Phonogram put all five of their European factories to work pressing the single.

Initial quantities of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; were made available from Monday 3 December 1984. It was not officially released until 7 December. It received further publicity from a launch party that day at the Royal Albert Hall during the charity event &quot;Dinner at Albert&#x27;s&quot;, an evening of music to raise money for Save the Children and the Ethiopia Famine Relief Fund. The single entered the UK singles chart the following week at number one, outselling all the other records in the chart put together, with the 7&quot; single alone selling 200,000 copies in the first two days of release. It sold a million copies in the first week, making it the fastest-selling single in UK chart history until Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;. UK sales passed three million on the last day of 1984. When Wham!, whose singer George Michael appeared on &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, reached number two with their single &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, they donated their royalties to the Band Aid Trust. 

&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was released in the US on 10 December 1984 on Columbia Records. It sold 1.9 million copies in its first eleven days on release but did not reach number one, due to the more complex chart system, which counted airplay as well as sales. Despite outselling the official number one by four to one, it did not make the top ten due to a lack of airplay, and reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A 30-minute making-of documentary was released in the UK on 15 December 1984 and in the US on 18 December 1984 on VHS and Betamax. It featured footage shot at the recording session, interviews with Geldof and Ure, as well as the completed promotional video. 

&quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; raised £8 million for Ethiopia within a year, far exceeding Geldof&#x27;s hopes. &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was reissued the following year on 29 November 1985. It reached number three in the UK singles chart the week following Christmas. It was remixed by Horn and included an updated B-side, &quot;One Year On (Feed the World)&quot;, beginning and ending with a recording of a telephone message from Geldof and in between featuring Ure reciting a list of what had been bought with the money raised during the previous 12 months. It had sold 11.7 million copies worldwide by 1989, and 3.8 million in the UK by 2017. A parody version, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Hallowe&#x27;en?&quot;, was released in 2005. In 2010, the BBC apologised after falsely reporting that money raised by Band Aid and Live Aid had been diverted by rebels and used to pay for weapons.

== Music video ==
As the single was recorded and released as quickly as possible, the music video simply featured footage from the recording session. Bowie, who had been unable to attend the recording, flew from Switzerland to record a short introduction for the video to be played on the BBC&#x27;s flagship television music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 29 November 1984. However, the show&#x27;s strict regulations meant that the song and its video could not be played until it had charted. Geldof contacted the BBC1 controller, Michael Grade, and persuaded him to have every programme preceding that week&#x27;s episode start five minutes early to make space for the video before the show. Several artists performing on that week&#x27;s episode, and the presenter Peter Powell, wore &quot;Feed the World&quot; T-shirts.

The video was shown on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; each week during its stay at number one. For the Christmas Day special edition, most of the artists on the record appeared in the studio to mime to the song. The most notable absentees were George Michael and Bono: during Michael&#x27;s line, the cameras focused on the studio audience, while Weller mimed Bono&#x27;s line to the camera. At the 1986 Grammy Awards, the video was nominated for Best Music Video, Short Form, losing to &quot;We Are the World&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The reception from the UK music press was mixed. &quot;NME&quot; wrote only: &quot;Millions of dead stars write and perform rotten record for the right reasons&quot;. &quot;Sounds&quot; said, &quot;It&#x27;s far from brilliant (if not quite the &quot;Bland&quot; Aid some have predicted) but you &quot;can&quot; have fun playing Spot the Star on the vocals, and it deserves to sell by the truckload&quot;. 

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote: &quot;Inevitably, after such massive publicity, the record itself is something of an anti-climax, even though Geldof&#x27;s sense of universal melodrama is perfectly suited to this kind of epic musical manifesto. Midge Ure&#x27;s large-screen production and the emotional vocal deliveries of the various celebrities matches the demonstrative sweep of Geldof&#x27;s lyric, which veers occasionally toward an uncomfortably generalised sentimentality which threatens to turn righteous pleading into pompous indignation. On the other hand, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s impossible to write flippantly about something as fundamentally dreadful as the Ethiopia famine.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
For the 2014 version, several contentious lyrics were rewritten, and the song was changed to focus on Ebola rather than famine. The new lyrics have also been criticised as promoting stereotypes and condescension. Criticism from Africans regarding the song remained: in 2014, African activists and Twitter users complained that the song disregarded the diversity of the continent of Africa and ultimately did more harm than good for the people. The musician Fuse ODG declined to sing on the 2014 version, saying the lyrics misrepresented Africa. He cited lyrics such as &quot;There is no peace and joy in west (sic) Africa this Christmas&quot;, and said he went to Ghana each year for the purposes of peace and joy.

Several publications and commentators have described the lyrics as racist and demeaning towards Ethiopians. Ethiopia is home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, and one likely slightly older than the United Kingdom, yet the lyrics and title imply that Africans would be unaware of Christmas at all. Peter Gill, one of the few Western journalists in Ethiopia at the time, said: &quot;As Ethiopians have pointed out ever since, they did of course know it was Christmas because the starving were mainly Orthodox] Christian.&quot;

In 2010, Geldof told Australia&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;I am responsible for two of the worst songs in history&quot;, with the other being &quot;We Are the World&quot;. Ure&#x27;s wrote in his autobiography that &quot;it is a song that has nothing to do with music. It was all about generating money... The song didn&#x27;t matter: the song was secondary, almost irrelevant.&quot; Responding to criticism in 2024, Geldof said &quot;this little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive&quot;. He said the alleged &quot;colonial tropes&quot; of the lyrics were in fact &quot;empirical facts&quot;, and that hunger remains endemic in Ethiopia, water is scarce, rain is increasingly unreliable due to climate change, and that Christmas ceremonies were abandoned throughout 1984 and 1986.

Professor Lisa Ann Richey from the Department of Management, Society and Communication at Copenhagen Business School, wrote for London School of Economics blog, that &quot;The commodifying compassion collaborative research project explains how producing the good feelings for helpers is a form of affective labour. Causes have been treated as commodities, and sold by celebrities like Geldof for decades. Consumer humanitarianism, ‘brand aid’ and celebrity activism are examples of the corporate norms infiltrating humanitarianism and development.&quot; she goes onto say that &quot;Moral responsibility, the currency peddled by Geldof, is based on pity for the Ethiopians suffering from famine, not on demands for justice. While pity historically played a role in charity-based philanthropy, the marketability of feeling of compassion is a recent trend in contemporary neoliberal capitalism.&quot;

==Band Aid II==
A second version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was recorded under the name of Band Aid II in 1989, overseen by the most successful British production team of the late 1980s, Stock Aitken Waterman. Geldof had telephoned Pete Waterman to ask him to produce a new version of the song to aid the ongoing situation in Ethiopia, and within 24 hours the recording session had been arranged at Stock Aitken Waterman&#x27;s studios on London&#x27;s South Bank. The recording took place over the weekend of 2 and 3 December, and featured several artists who had already been produced by SAW, including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Bananarama, Sonia, and Cliff Richard, as well as other artists who had big hits in 1989, such as Lisa Stansfield, Jimmy Somerville, Wet Wet Wet and Bros. Bananarama&#x27;s Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward became the only artists to appear on both the 1984 and 1989 versions of the record. Siobhan Fahey, who had been part of Bananarama&#x27;s line-up at the time the first recording of the song was released, had left the group in 1988.

The lyrics were rearranged for a more traditional &#x27;verse and chorus&#x27; structure, with the opening verse being split in two with a short repeat of the ending chorus being played at the end of both, followed by the &quot;here&#x27;s to you&quot; section and a final lengthened version of the closing chorus (with commentary by Michael Buerk played over the outro in the music video).

Released on 11 December 1989, the Band Aid II version spent three weeks at number one in the UK, becoming the Christmas number one single and the last number one single of the 1980s, and ended the year as the ninth biggest selling single of 1989.

==Band Aid 20==
Band Aid 20 recorded a third version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in November 2004 for the twentieth anniversary of the original recording, and again got to number one. The recording and release of the single tied in with the release of the Live Aid concert on DVD for the first time. The idea was prompted by Coldplay&#x27;s Chris Martin, although Geldof and Ure both got quickly involved. Geldof did the publicity and educated the younger artists on the issues (some of whom had not been born, or were very young, when the original was recorded) while Ure filmed the event for the corresponding documentary.

The Band Aid 20 version was produced by Nigel Godrich, who was contacted by Ure. Godrich said: &quot;&#x27;I thought, &#x27;Oh fuck!&#x27; Then I thought I should do it. In our lives we give so little back.&quot; He enlisted musicians including Paul McCartney (on bass), the Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey, and Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead. Godrich said in 2009: &quot;I&#x27;m glad I did it – it raised quite a bit of money. It came on when I was sitting in a lobby somewhere once, and it took me a while to recognise it. It sounded good though, better than I remembered.&quot;

The artists gathered to record the chorus at AIR Studios, London, on Sunday 14 November 2004. The backing track and many of the solo lines had been recorded over the previous two days. Damon Albarn did not take part in the recording but arrived to serve tea to the participants. The 2004 version sold 1.8 million copies.

==Band Aid 30==
At a press conference on 10 November 2014, Geldof and Ure announced that another group of artists would come together to record the song, this time under the banner of Band Aid 30 and in aid of the Ebola crisis. The 2014 version was recorded on Saturday 15 November 2014 and released on the following Monday, 17 November.

===Background===
Tracey Emin provided the artwork and Paul Epworth produced the track. Vocal contributions came from artists including Ed Sheeran, One Direction, Paloma Faith, Ellie Goulding, Seal, Sam Smith, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Rita Ora, Emeli Sandé, Bastille and Olly Murs. Returning guest musicians from previous versions of the song included Chris Martin (who recorded the opening lines of the 2004 version) and Bono (who sang the tenth line in both the 1984 and 2004 versions). Unlike the previous versions, where lyrics were almost identical to the original, the lyrics were altered to address the then-ongoing outbreak. The lyric changes include the following:

* &quot;Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears&quot; is replaced with &quot;Where a kiss of love can kill you and there&#x27;s death in every tear&quot;
* &quot;Well, tonight thank God it&#x27;s them instead of you&quot; is replaced with &quot;Well tonight we&#x27;re reaching out and touching you&quot;
* &quot;And there won&#x27;t be snow in Africa this Christmas time&quot; is replaced with &quot;Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa&quot;.
* &quot;The greatest gift they&#x27;ll get this year is life&quot; is replaced with &quot;A song of hope where there&#x27;s no hope tonight&quot;.
* &quot;Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow&quot; is replaced with &quot;Why is comfort to be feared? Why is to touch to be scared?&quot;.
* &quot;Underneath that burning sun&quot; is replaced with &quot;And all there is to come&quot;.
* &quot;Do they know...&quot; is rephrased as &quot;How can they know...&quot;.
* During the coda, &quot;Feed the world&quot; alternates with &quot;Heal the world&quot;.

===Release history===
==Band Aid 40==
A version combining elements of several versions of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; (the original, 20th and 30th anniversary versions), mixed and produced by Trevor Horn, was released on 25 November 2024, the song&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

Ed Sheeran, who contributed vocals to the 2014 version, said he would have refused permission to reuse his vocals had he been asked, saying his opinion about the song had changed. He shared a post by the British-Ghanaian vocalist Fuse ODG, saying the song &quot;perpetuated damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa’s economic growth, tourism and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity&quot;.

The song peaked at #8 in the UK singles chart.

==Glee Cast version==

The song was covered by the cast of &quot;Glee&quot; and was released in 2011 as a single and alongside the full-length album &quot;&quot;. The song was featured in the season three Christmas episode, &quot;Extraordinary Merry Christmas&quot;.

===Charts===
==Band Aid Liverpool version==
In December 2020, a group of musicians from Liverpool recorded a version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; under the name Band Aid Liverpool as a charity record in support of Shelter. Retitled &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas (Feed the World)&quot; with lyrics referring to places on Merseyside, the project was given the go-ahead by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, with Band Aid Liverpool releasing their cover version on 10 December 2020.

==Keith Lemon and Friends version==
In December 2020, comedian Leigh Francis recorded a version of the song in honour of late TV presenter Caroline Flack, with proceeds raising money for the Trussell Trust, Crisis, UNICEF, Shelter and Samaritans. His version, recorded in character as Keith Lemon and the Bear from &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot;, featured Emma Bunton, Peter Andre and Ronan Keating (with Keating also turning up on a version of LadBaby&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Eatin&#x27;&quot;, another 2020 Christmas number one contender raising money for the Trussell Trust).

On 12 December 2022, British blogger Mark Hoyle, aka LadBaby, announced that he had been given permission from Ure, Geldof, and the Band Aid Trust to rewrite the lyrics to &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; and release it as his 2022 Christmas single. Retitled &quot;Food Aid&quot;, the single was released on 16 December 2022, and featured Hoyle&#x27;s wife Roxanne and the financial journalist Martin Lewis. Half of the money raised would go to the Trussell Trust and the other half to the Band Aid Trust.

LadBaby achieved the Christmas number one for the fifth consecutive year, making them the first act to achieve five UK Christmas number-one singles, surpassing the record set by the Beatles.

<text>Hippolyte Alexandre Julien Moulin, sometimes given as Julien-Hippolyte Moulin or Hypolite Moulin, (1832–1884) was a 19th-century French sculptor.

Moulin, a shopkeeper&#x27;s son, entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1855 but was unable to afford to continue the lessons and had to become a language teacher in Paris to support himself. He subsequently studied with Auguste-Louis-Marie Ottin and with Antoine-Louis Barye.His bronze statue &quot;A Lucky Find at Pompeii&quot; (&quot;Une Trouvaille à Pompei&quot;) (1863) depicts a nude boy with a spade dancing for joy with one leg raised, because he has unearthed a Roman statuette. His nude pose reflects that of the statuette itself, possibly indicating that the statue depicts the excavator &quot;imagining&quot; himself in the original statuette&#x27;s pose. The statue won a medal at the Paris Salon of 1864 and became his most famous work. The life-size original was bought by the French Government for 7,000 francs and exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1867. It stands on a tall pedestal in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay alongside Alexandre Falguière&#x27;s &quot;Winner of the Cockfight&quot; on an adjacent pedestal - another bronze nude dancing boy poised on one leg that had also been exhibited at the 1864 Salon.

Moulin won further Salon medals in 1867 and 1869, and another at the Exposition Universelle, 1878.

His other works include &quot;Victoria Mars&quot; (plaster exhibited at the Salon of 1872) and &quot;A Secret from On High&quot; (&quot;Secret d&#x27;en Haut&quot;) (plaster 1873; marble 1875, now also in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay alongside other marble statues.)

&quot;A Secret from On High&quot; depicts a life-size adolescent nude Mercury (Hermes) whispering a secret to a herm - a pillar topped by a bust of himself - knowing that it will never repeat what he tells it.

Moulin spent his last few years in a rest home for the mentally ill.

<text>Dr Terrible&#x27;s House of Horrible is a satirical British comedy horror anthology series created by Graham Duff, who co-wrote the series with Steve Coogan. BBC Two broadcast the series in 2001. The title parodies Amicus Productions&#x27; anthology film &quot;Dr Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; (1965). Coogan presents each episode as Dr. Terrible, and plays various roles throughout.

The show spoofs the British horror films of Amicus Productions, Hammer Film Productions, and Tigon British Film Productions, and most particularly, such noted 1970s anthology series as Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, with Amicus films, both series utilising different, well-known ensemble casts in each episode.

Horror film veterans Honor Blackman, Graham Crowden, Sheila Keith, Joan Greenwood and Angela Pleasence each guest-starred in an episode, in a pastiche of their earlier film performances. Mark Gatiss, John Thomson, Simon Pegg, Ronni Ancona and Warwick Davis also appeared.

Viewership of the six-episode series fell short of expectations, and the BBC declined to recommission it. 2 Entertain published it to DVD-Video on 4 August 2003.

<text>Gastonia is a formerly accepted genus of plants in the ivy and ginseng family, Araliaceae. It had been known as an unnatural group, but was recognized as late as 2010, when its nine species were distributed to four different subgenera of the large genus &quot;Polyscias&quot;. Because the genus &quot;Gastonia&quot; is now obsolete, its species are herein referred to by their names in &quot;Polyscias&quot;.

The species that constituted &quot;Gastonia&quot; are mostly island endemics, with Madagascar and New Guinea being the largest land masses on which any of them naturally occur. &quot;Gastonia&quot; had a disjunct distribution, with three species from the Seychelles, three more from the Mascarenes, one from Madagascar and the Comoro Islands, and two distributed from Malesia to the Solomon Islands.

&quot;Gastonia&quot; is a genus of small to large size trees. It shares with related genera, the lack of an articulation on the pedicel, below the flower. It is distinguished from &quot;Reynoldsia&quot;, &quot;Munroidendron&quot;, and &quot;Tetraplasandra&quot; by the radiating style arms that persist on the fruit.

==Species==
Listed below are the nine species placed in &quot;Gastonia&quot; by Frodin and Govaerts (2003). Names in &quot;Polyacias&quot; are from Lowry and Plunkett (2010).
* &quot;Polyscias crassa&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia crassa&quot;)
* &quot;Polyscias cutispongia&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia cutispongia&quot;)
* &quot;Polyscias duplicata&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia duplicata&quot;)
* &quot;Polyscias maraisiana&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia elegans&quot;, &quot;Gastonia mauritiana&quot;)
* &quot;Polyscias lionnetii&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia lionnetii&quot;)
* &quot;Polyscias rodriguesiana&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia rodriguesiana&quot;)
* &quot;Polyscias sechellarum&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia sechellarum&quot;)
** &quot;P. sechellarum&quot; var. &quot;contracta&quot;
** &quot;P. sechellarum&quot; var. &quot;curiosae&quot;
** &quot;P. sechellarum&quot; var. &quot;sechellarum&quot;
* &quot;Polyscias serratifolia&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia serratifolia&quot;)
* &quot;Polyscias spectabilis&quot; (= &quot;Gastonia spectabilis&quot;)

== Notes on selected species ==
&quot;Polyscias spectabilis&quot; is from New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It sometimes exceeds in height, and is the tallest member of Araliaceae. Like most members of &quot;Polyscias&quot;, &quot;P. spectabilis&quot; is sparingly branched, sometimes even palm-like in form, at least when young. Mature individuals of &quot;P. spectabilis&quot; are sometimes unbranched for 3/4 of the height of the tree. Hermann Harms erected the monotypic genus &quot;Peekeliopanax&quot; for it in 1926, but was not followed by other authors.

The type species for &quot;Gastonia&quot; is &quot;Gastonia cutispongia&quot; (now &quot;Polyscias cutispongia&quot;). It is a tall, smooth tree with spongy bark. It is native to Réunion and sometimes planted there, but it has become very rare.

&quot;Polyscias maraisiana&quot; is endemic to Mauritius and was cultivated in Europe in the 19th century, but has not been seen there since that time. It was considered exotic on account of its strikingly heteroblastic leaves.

&quot;Polyscias maraisiana&quot; has been the subject of some nomenclatural instability. In 1984, Wessel Marais separated it from &quot;Gastonia cutispongia&quot; as &quot;Gastonia mauritiana&quot;. In 2003, it was shown that the correct name for this species was &quot;Gastonia elegans&quot; because it had first been described in 1866 as &quot;Terminalia elegans&quot;. This description was a large and unexpected taxonomic error because &quot;Terminalia&quot; is in the Myrtalean family Combretaceae. In 2010, when this species was transferred to &quot;Polyscias&quot;, the specific epithet had to be changed again because the names &quot;Polyscias mauritiana&quot; and &quot;Polyscias elegans&quot; already existed. The latter two are in the &quot;Polyscias&quot; subgenera Grotefendia and Tieghemopanax, respectively.

The most widespread and variable of the species in the former &quot;Gastonia&quot; is &quot;Polyscias serratifolia&quot;. It ranges thru most of Malesia and from there to the Solomon Islands. Some of its varieties have been named as separate species and placed in other genera, such as &quot;Arthrophyllum&quot; and &quot;Tetraplasandra&quot;. These were united into one species by Philipson, as &quot;Gastonia papuana&quot; in 1970, and as &quot;Gastonia serratifolia&quot; in 1979.

== History ==
Quattrocchi states that &quot;Gastonia&quot; was &quot;named after Gaston d&#x27;Orléans, 1608-1660, a patron and promoter of botany and floriculture&quot;. The name was originated by Philibert Commerson, but validated later, in 1788, by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in &quot;Encyclopédie Méthodique.

Lamarck gave a detailed description of the species that he named &quot;Gastonia cutispongia&quot;. He named another species, but gave it only a cursory description. No one today is really sure of what the other species was. Some authors believe that it was not even a member of Araliaceae.

Other species were added to &quot;Gastonia&quot; in the 19th century. In 1898, Hermann Harms transferred what is now &quot;Polyscias sechellarum&quot; to &quot;Gastonia&quot; in a landmark monograph on Araliaceae in Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien.

William Raymond Philipson gave &quot;Gastonia&quot; its modern definition in 1970. He included Malesian species that had been in &quot;Tetraplasandra&quot;, thus restricting that genus to the Hawaiian Islands. He also reduced the monotypic genera &quot;Indokingia&quot; (&quot;Polyscias crassa&quot;) and &quot;Peekeliopanax&quot; (&quot;Polyscias spectabilis&quot;) into synonymy under &quot;Gastonia&quot;.

William Botting Hemsley had named &quot;Indokingia&quot; in 1906 in Hooker&#x27;s Icones Plantarum. &quot;Peekeliopanax&quot; was a name that Hermann Harms had applied to a flowering specimen in 1926. A few years later, he placed a fruiting specimen of the same species under &quot;Gastonia&quot;.

In 2003, a checklist and nomenclator was published for Araliaceae by Kew Gardens. Nine species were recognized therein for &quot;Gastonia&quot;. The genus was described as &quot;generalized, altho in details, it is quite varied&quot;. Since that time, molecular phylogenetic studies, based on DNA sequences, have shown that &quot;Gastonia&quot; was polyphyletic. These studies have shown that biogeography is strongly correlated with relationships in Araliaceae.

In 2010, the genus &quot;Polyscias&quot; was expanded from about 100 species to 159. The number of species in &quot;Polyscias&quot; will be around 250 when the undescribed species are published. Six genera (&quot;Arthrophyllum&quot;, &quot;Cuphocarpus&quot;, &quot;Gastonia&quot;, &quot;Reynoldsia&quot;, &quot;Munroidendron&quot;, and &quot;Tetraplasandra&quot;) were placed in synonymy under &quot;Polyscias&quot;. In accordance with the phylogenetic studies of DNA, &quot;Polyscias&quot; was divided into 11 subgenera (Polyscias, Grotefendia, Maralia, Arthrophyllum, Cuphocarpus, Tetraplasandra, Eupteron, Sciadopanax, Tieghemopanax, Indokingia, and Palmervandenbroekia) and seven species were left incertae sedis.

The nine species that had been in &quot;Gastonia&quot; went to four different subgenera of &quot;Polyscias&quot;; three species went to Grotefendia, three more to Indokingia, two to Tetraplasandra, and one to Maralia.

&quot;Polyscias cutispongia&quot;, &quot;Polyscias maraisiana&quot;, and &quot;Polyscias rodriguesiana&quot; are endemic to Réunion, Mauritius, and Rodrigues, respectively. The latter two were separated from &quot;P. cutispongia&quot; in 1984. They are in &quot;Polyscias&quot; subgenus Grotefendia, which comprises 15 species, all from the Mascarene Islands. The type species for &quot;Polyscias&quot; subgenus Grotefendia is &quot;Polyscias repanda&quot;.

&quot;Polyscias&quot; subgenus Grotefendia contains &quot;Polyscias cutispongia&quot;, the type species for &quot;Gastonia&quot;. If the subgenus Grotefendia were to be raised to the taxonomic rank of genus, the name &quot;Gastonia&quot; would have priority over Grotefendia, according to the ICNAFP.

&quot;Polyscias crassa&quot;, &quot;Polyscias sechellarum&quot;, and &quot;Polyscias lionnetii&quot; are all from the Seychelles, with &quot;Polyscias lionnetii&quot; being very rare and restricted to the island of Mahé. These are the only species of &quot;Polyscias&quot; in the Seychelles, and together, they constitute &quot;Polyscias&quot; subgenus Indokingia. &quot;Polyscias seychellarum&quot; is an orthographical variant of &quot;Polyscias sechellarum&quot;. &quot;Polyscias sechellarum&quot; was divided into three varieties in 1987, but some authors have declined to recognize them until further studies can be done on this species.

&quot;Polyscias duplicata&quot; (formerly &quot;Gastonia duplicata&quot;) is in &quot;Polyscias&quot; subgenus Maralia. Maralia is, by far, the largest subgenus of &quot;Polyscias&quot;, with about 115 species. Most of them, like &quot;Polyscias duplicata&quot;, are endemic to Madagascar.

&quot;Polyscias serratifolia&quot; and &quot;Polyscias spectabilis&quot; are now in &quot;Polyscias&quot; subgenus Tetraplasandra. This is a wide-ranging subgenus of 21 species. Eleven species are endemic to Hawaii, and ten others are distributed in a large area that includes Malesia and extends eastward to Tahiti.

<text>The Port of Philadelphia is located on the Delaware River in Philadelphia in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.

The Port of Philadelphia generally refers to the publicly owned marine terminals located within Philadelphia city limits along the west bank of the river. These terminals are managed by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, PhilaPort, an agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The term is sometimes used for Delaware River port complex to collectively refer to the ports and energy facilities along the river in the tri-state PA-NJ-DE Delaware Valley region. They include the Port of Salem, the Port of Wilmington, the Port of Chester, the Port of Paulsboro, the Port of Philadelphia, and the Port of Camden. Combined they create one of the largest shipping areas of the United States. In 2016, 2,427 ships arrived at Delaware River port facilities: 577 fruit ships, 474 petroleum ships, and 431 containerized cargo ships.

== &quot;PhilaPort&quot; (The Philadelphia Regional Port Authority) ==
The Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, commonly known as PhilaPort, and referred to as The Port of Philadelphia, is an independent agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania charged with the management, maintenance, marketing, and promotion of port facilities along the Delaware River in Pennsylvania, as well as strategic planning throughout the port district. PhilaPort works with its terminal operators to improve its facilities and to market those facilities to prospective port users around the world. Port cargoes and the activities they generate are responsible for thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the Philadelphia area and throughout Pennsylvania.

On May 22, 2017, The Philadelphia Regional Port Authority (PRPA) announced that it was rebranding as &quot;PhilaPort (The Port of Philadelphia)&quot; effective immediately. The name ‘PhilaPort’ was decided on to distinguish The Port of Philadelphia from the many other regional authorities.

==Terminals==

The Port consists of a series of marine terminals, each with specialized capabilities.

*Packer Avenue Marine Terminal: This facility handles containers, steel products, frozen meat, fruit, heavy lift cargo, project cargo, and paper on 6 berths plus 1 Ro/Ro berth at a depth of MLW of . The facility features of dry storage and of refrigerated storage with 2,500 reefer plugs.
*Tioga Marine Terminal: This facility handles containers, specialized forest products, over-dimensional cargo, palletized cargo, project cargo, break-bulk cargo, and steel on 6 berths at a depth of MLW of . The facility features of dry storage, of which is refrigerated storage with 116 reefer plugs.
*Pier 82: This facility handles fruits and vegetables, break-bulk cargo, project cargo, and paper on 2 berths at a depth of MLW of . The facility features of dry, temperature-controlled storage.
*Pier 84: This facility is dedicated exclusively to cocoa beans and other cocoa products on 1 berth at a depth of MLW of 32 feet (9.8 meters). The facility features of dry storage.
*Philadelphia Forest Products Center: This facility at piers 38, 40, 78, and 80 handles newsprint, coated paper, wood pulp, other forest products, other break-bulk, and semi-bulk products on 2 berths plus 2 Ro/Ro berths at a depth of MLW of . The facility features of dry storage.
*Philadelphia Automobile Processing Facility: This facility handles automobiles, project cargo, trucks, and heavy equipment just offshore with immediate access to Packer Avenue Marine Terminal and Pier 96. The facility features an auto-washing and auto service building.

==Shipyard==
Hog Island was once the largest shipyard in the nation. In 1917, as part of the World War I effort, the U.S. government contracted American International Shipbuilding to build ships and a shipyard at Hog Island. At the time Hog Island was the largest shipyard in the world, with 50 slipways. The first ship, named for the Lenape name for the site, was christened August 5, 1918, by Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of U.S. president Woodrow Wilson.

The Philly Shipyard is a private company operating on what was once the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

==Development in the 2000s==
;Delaware River Main Channel Deepening: A project to deepen the Delaware River&#x27;s 103-mile main shipping channel from 40 to 45 feet began in 2010 and was completed in 2017. The $392 million project was funded by the Federal Government and local-match sponsor PhilaPort (using Commonwealth of Pennsylvania general funds).

;Infrastructure Upgrade: A $300 million Port Development Plan was announced by the Commonwealth in November 2016, which will expand and improve cargo operations throughout the Port&#x27;s busiest areas. As part of the $300 million Port Development Plan, the first two of five giant cranes capable of unloading the largest container ships arrived in March 2018 from China, where they were manufactured.

;New Leadership: In August 2016 PhilaPort&#x27;s Board of Directors hired Jeff Theobald, a maritime industry professional with more than 40 years of experience in terminal operations and shipping logistics, as its new executive director and CEO, to further professionalize the port&#x27;s operations.

==History==
The Port of Philadelphia was established more than 300 years ago during the colonial period, and was for a time the busiest port in both that period and the earliest years of the new republic, finally being eclipsed by the Port of New York. In much of the 20th Century, the Port was overseen by the city&#x27;s Department of Wharves, Docks, and Ferries, which was replaced by the quasi-public Philadelphia Port Corporation in 1964.

In 1989, following the lead of other municipal ports that made overtures to their respective state governments for capital and operating support, the Port of Philadelphia moved from city to state control, with a new agency, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, established by the State Legislature&#x27;s Act 50 of 1989 to run the Port. The Port of Philadelphia has always been a landlord port, with private companies being given leases to run the Port&#x27;s facilities, with capital and marketing support provided by the Commonwealth and PRPA. Holt Logistics is the largest private company in the Port of Philadelphia with automobiles and fresh fruit driving imports. In 2024, the Gloucester Marine Terminal (operated by a Holt company, Gloucester Terminals LLC) and the Packer Avenue Marine Terminal (operated by another Holt company, Greenwich Terminals LLC), handled over 88 percent of Chilean fruit on the East Coast, up from 72 percent in 2023, according to Holt. And while overall Moroccan citrus volumes decreased in 2024, the percentage of volume handled in Gloucester and at PAMT increased in 2024, with the region responsible for 76 percent of the volume. 

===Philadelphia Cruise Terminal===
The Philadelphia Cruise Terminal was located at 5100 South Broad Street within the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The Delaware River Port Authority began operating the terminal in 1998 in Building 3, a landmarked 1874 Navy Yard building. Following the September 11 attacks the Philadelphia terminal accommodated some of the ships that had been diverted from New York. Its peak year was 2006 when it handled 36 cruises. By 2011 the schedule had dwindled to just two cruises. The DRPA decided to close the terminal rather than invest additional operating costs or capital improvements. Its demise was attributed to a combination of the economic downturn, increasing size of cruise ships, and six hours needed to navigate the Delaware River before entering open ocean.

federal court, presided over by judge Anita Brody, ruled down on June 14, rejected Penn Warehouse&#x27;s financial demands and ordered the ship to be removed in 90 days until September 12, 2024 from Pier 82.

<doc id="848116" wikidata="Q2587533" url="?curid=848116" title="Phileas Fogg">
<text>Phileas Fogg ( ) is the protagonist in the 1872 Jules Verne novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. Inspirations for the character were the American entrepreneur George Francis Train and American writer and adventurer William Perry Fogg.

==Fictional biography==
Fogg is a man of independent means and is a gentleman who is &quot;exact&quot;, as in he has a perfect routine and life right down to the number of steps he walks to the temperature of his shaving water. Having fired a servant for providing him with shaving water at a slightly incorrect temperature, he hires Jean Passepartout as a new servant. Fogg makes a wager of £20,000 (£2.4 million in 2022) with members of London&#x27;s Reform Club that he can circumnavigate the world in 80 days or fewer. He sets out with his French servant Jean Passepartout to win the wager, unaware that he is being followed by a detective named Fix, who suspects Fogg of having robbed the Bank of England. Fix spends the first half of the book trying to delay Fogg&#x27;s journey to keep him in British territory. However, after Fogg reaches America, Fix helps Fogg complete his bet to get him back to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, where he will be under British jurisdiction and Fix can arrest him (while still suspicious that Fogg will run off and go into hiding somewhere on the journey).

While in India, Fogg saves a widowed princess, Aouda, from &quot;sati&quot; during her husband&#x27;s funeral and she accompanies Fogg for the rest of his journey after initial plans to take her to an uncle failed as the uncle had moved. Together, the trio have numerous exciting adventures which come to an abrupt end when he is arrested by Fix immediately upon their arrival back in Britain. Although Fogg is quickly exonerated of the crime, the delay caused by his false arrest appears to have cost him the wager. However, he learns from Passepartout that he has gained one calendar day during his travels, allowing him to reach the Reform Club just in time to meet his deadline and collect his winnings. He marries Aouda and divides the remainder of his travel money between Fix and Passepartout.

==Other appearances==
In Albert Robida&#x27;s &quot;Voyages très extraordinaires de Saturnin Farandoul&quot; (1879), Fogg appears in the narrative having gone on an attempt to travel the world again, this time in 77 days. He is portrayed as a serial saviour of ladies, having over three hundred rescued women accompanying him on his travels, which have lasted well over three years by the time he is introduced.

In Philip José Farmer&#x27;s &quot;The Other Log of Phileas Fogg&quot; (1973), he is said to be Eridanean, an Earth-born member of the more benevolent of two extraterrestrial factions attempting to control the Earth; Fogg is a member of Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton family. Fogg&#x27;s adventures continue in &quot;Phileas Fogg and the War of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Phileas Fogg and the Heart of Orsra&quot;, both by Josh Reynolds, and in &quot;Being an Account of the Delay at Green River, Wyoming, of Phileas Fogg, World Traveler, or, The Masked Man Meets an English Gentleman&quot; by Win Scott Eckert.

<text>Wulfstan (died December 956) was Archbishop of York between 931 and 952. He is often known as Wulfstan I, to separate him from Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York.

==Early life==

Wulfstan was consecrated in 931. He was presumably appointed with the consent of King Æthelstan, and attested all of the king&#x27;s charters between 931 and 935. Between 936 and 41, however, he was absent from the king&#x27;s court, for unknown reasons.

==Career==
Wulfstan&#x27;s career is characterised by frequent swapping of allegiances, both among Viking leaders from Dublin and the Wessex kings. Perhaps Wulfstan played the part of &#x27;king-maker&#x27; in Northumbrian politics in the mid-10th century, or perhaps he was guided by self-preservation and the interests of the Church in Northumbria.

In 939, King Olaf Guthfrithson of Dublin invaded Northumbria and occupied York. King Edmund of England marched north to remove Olaf from York, but in 940 Wulfstan and Archbishop Wulfhelm of Canterbury arranged a treaty that ceded the area between Watling Street and the border of Northumbria to Olaf. But Olaf died in late 940, and his rule in York was inherited by his cousin, Olaf Sitricson who became King of Jórvík. In 944, Olaf Sitricson and his co-ruler Ragnald Guthfrithson were driven out from York; the chronicler Æthelweard wrote that it was &quot;Bishop Wulfstan and the eoldormen of the Mercians&quot; who were responsible for their expulsion. In 947 Wulfstan invited Eric Bloodaxe, the King of Orkney to become King of Jórvík. Eadred of Wessex brutally ravaged Northumbria in 948, forcing Eric to leave Northumbria. Olaf Cuaran then resumed his second reign at York. By 951, Wulfstan appears to have supported Eric&#x27;s claim to the kingdom of York over Olaf as he ceased to witness charters at the English court. In 952, Olaf was driven out by the Northumbrians in favor of Eric.

==Later life==
Eadred then re-invaded and imprisoned Wulfstan. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; version D says that &quot;because accusations had often been made to the king against him&quot;, Eadred arrested Wulfstan and took him to &quot;Iudanbyrig&quot; (the location of which is not known). He attested some charters in 953, so he was not imprisoned then. Although he was restored to episcopal office, he had to exercise his authority from distant Dorchester, from York. He appears not to have attended court for most of 956 and was possibly in failing health by then. According to Lesley Abrams: &quot;After the sidelining to the treacherous Wulfstan I, Oscytel, a kinsman of Oda, became Archbishop of York in 956.&quot; He died at Oundle, Northamptonshire, on 16 or 26 December 956. He was buried at Oundle.

==Assessment==
The historian Clare Downham observes that Wulfstan was almost certainly made archbishop in 931 with Æthelstan&#x27;s support:
:It may seem surprising, then, that the bishop was a staunch supporter of Scandinavian rule in York throughout his career, or at least whenever he felt it safe to do so. Some hints of this are provided in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (D). This shows that Wulfstan accompanied a Scandinavian king called Olafr on a raid into Mercia. Wulfstan later swore allegiance to Eadred, King of England (946-55), but he broke his oath soon after and endured temporary imprisonment by the same King in the 950s. Wulfstan thus appears as a power-broker and a leading figure in Northumbria at this time. But he was also someone wno took political risks with varying success.

<text>Kent Alan Hrbek (; born May 21, 1960), nicknamed &quot;Herbie&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball first baseman. He played his entire 14-year baseball career with the Minnesota Twins (1981–1994). Hrbek batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He hit the first home run in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome on April 3, 1982, in an exhibition game against the Phillies. Fans knew Hrbek as an outstanding defensive player, perennial slugger, and charismatic hometown favorite. Former Twins pitcher Jim Kaat considered Hrbek to be the best defensive first baseman he had ever seen, despite him never winning a Gold Glove at the position.

== Early life ==
Hrbek was born in Minneapolis on May 21, 1960. He attended Kennedy High School in Bloomington, Minnesota.

==Career==
Kent Hrbek was drafted by his hometown Minnesota Twins in the 17th round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft and spent the next three seasons working his way up the Twins&#x27; organizational ladder where he would hit 47 home runs and rack up 111 runs batted in while hitting .318 in 253 minor league games. In 1979, Hrbek played 24 games for the rookie league Elizabethton Twins in the Appalachian Rookie League before spending the next two seasons playing A ball—first for the Wisconsin Rapids Twins in the Midwest League and then the Visalia Oaks in the California League. Hrbek made his major league debut on August 24, 1981, at Yankee Stadium, hitting a game-winning home run in the 12th inning off New York reliever and future Twins player George Frazier.

After his &quot;cup of coffee&quot; at the end of the 1981 season, Hrbek would make the team out of spring training and come into his own in 1982, playing well for Twins manager Billy Gardner. Finishing his rookie season hitting .301 with 23 home runs and 92 RBI, Hrbek would finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting (to future Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr.) and be selected to his only All-Star game. Although the Twins would finish 60–102, Hrbek and fellow rookies Tim Laudner, Gary Gaetti, Tom Brunansky, Randy Bush, and Frank Viola would make up the nucleus of the 1987 World Series team. Falling off slightly in his sophomore year (.297, 16 HR, 84 RBI), Hrbek would come up big in 1984, finishing the season hitting .311 (his second-highest career batting average) with 27 HR (his 3rd highest total), 107 RBI (his highest career total), 174 hits (his highest total), and 80 runs (his third highest total). During, arguably, his career year, Hrbek would power the Twins all season and the team would surprise the rest of the American League West by battling for the division crown. Although the team was as close as 0.5 games out of first place at 81–75, the Twins faded fast, lost their last 6 games, and finished in a tie with the California Angels, three games behind the Kansas City Royals. After the season, Hrbek was recognized for his performance and the team&#x27;s surprise September run, by his finishing second in the American League Most Valuable Player balloting to Detroit Tigers&#x27; closer Willie Hernández.

===World Series Play===
Some of his most memorable moments were during the 1987 season. He hit a career-best 34 home runs to help the Twins win the AL West.

Hrbek was instrumental in capturing the World Series Championship, although he hit only .208, as he slugged a grand slam in Game 6 off Cardinals reliever Ken Dayley, which essentially sealed the win for his Twins.

In 1991, he again helped the Twins win the World Series after having a typical Hrbek season (.284, 20 home runs, and 89 RBI). The Twins had finished the previous season in last place, as had their Series opponent the Atlanta Braves, which prompted the media to coin the phrase &quot;Worst to First World Series.&quot; Hrbek&#x27;s offense turned stale after his home run in Game 1 and he hit only .115 for the series with the one home run and 2 RBI. However, in Game 7, with the score still tied 0–0 in the 8th inning, Hrbek executed a very uncommon 3–2–3 bases-loaded double play with catcher Brian Harper which saved the Twins against the Braves&#x27; biggest threat of the game. The Twins eventually won the game 1–0, with Gene Larkin hitting a bases-loaded single to center field that scored Dan Gladden in the bottom of the 10th inning.

Hrbek was involved in a controversial play with Ron Gant in Game 2 of the 1991 Series. While Gant was coming back to first base after widely rounding the base on a single, it appeared Hrbek lifted Gant off the bag while applying the tag. Umpire Drew Coble called Gant out. Gant angrily disputed the call and had to be restrained when Coble refused to change it. The move was later nicknamed the &quot;T-Rex Tag,&quot; because of Hrbek&#x27;s long-standing, but joking nickname, in which he jokingly speculated about a post-baseball career in professional wrestling using the name &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;. When the Series moved to Atlanta, Braves fans jeered him, and Hrbek received much hate mail, including a death threat.

Although he was a key part of both World Series teams, Hrbek was largely ineffective at the plate, hitting just .154 in 24 post-season games with only 3 home runs and 12 RBI. Hrbek was one of seven Twins to be part of both the 1987 and 1991 World Series teams. The other six were Randy Bush, Greg Gagne, Kirby Puckett, Al Newman, Gene Larkin (who made the winning hit in Game 7 of the 1991 series), and Dan Gladden (who was the runner Larkin scored with that hit).

===Media===

Hrbek served as an unofficial consultant for the baseball movie &quot;Little Big League&quot; (1994). The character of Lou Collins was loosely based on him and actor Timothy Busfield (himself a former minor league player) became friends during filming.

==Retirement==
Frequently injured (though seldom seriously), Hrbek retired after the players strike in 1994, citing his nagging injury problems and desire to spend more time with his wife and daughter at their home in Bloomington, Minnesota. Hrbek, who was notorious for losing his stirrups, was the most outspoken member of the MLBPA to revise the uniform code to remove mandatory stirrups and helped to ensure it was written into the new labor agreement following the 1994 player strike. &quot;I&#x27;m thankful that future generations of players will not have to rummage through their lockers 20 minutes before the first pitch to find those darn stirrups. If that&#x27;s my lone contribution to the game, I&#x27;ve done enough.&quot; Despite operating in the same lineup as Kirby Puckett for all but two years of his career—and his long and close association with Puckett—Hrbek&#x27;s numbers never approached those of the center fielder. In 2000, his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, Hrbek garnered only 5 votes, which was nowhere near the 5% minimum threshold for continued eligibility. Thus, he is ineligible for the Hall of Fame unless voted in by the Veterans Committee. His first year of Veterans&#x27; Committee eligibility was 2015. 
Kent Hrbek&#x27;s number 14 was retired by the Twins in 1995, which at the time, made him just the fourth Twins player in franchise history to have his number retired. (The other three were Harmon Killebrew, Rod Carew, and Tony Oliva.) Hrbek was also inducted into the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He was also one of few players at the time—and even rarer by today&#x27;s standards—to have played out his entire career with only one team. He never expressed any desire to play for any other team and took less money than he could have made elsewhere to remain with the Twins for his final contract which covered the 1990–1994 seasons.

In 2000, the Twins established their own &quot;Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame,&quot; and Hrbek was one of six former Twins inducted into the initial class. The 2000 class also included MLB Hall of Famers Rod Carew, Harmon Killebrew, Kirby Puckett, and Tony Oliva, along with former owner Calvin Griffith.

===Other affiliations===
Hrbek is an avid hunter and fisherman, particularly in his home state of Minnesota. He hosted an outdoor sports program on KMSP-TV called &quot;Kent Hrbek Outdoors&quot; from 2004 to 2010. Hrbek is a perennial pitchman for Twin Cities-area HVAC companies offering Carrier Heating and Air Conditioning equipment. He has a series of baseball fields named after him in his hometown of Bloomington.

Since Kent Hrbek&#x27;s father died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or &quot;Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease&quot;) in 1982, he has worked to increase awareness of the disease. Hrbek hosts an annual charity golf tournament in Minnesota to raise money for ALS research and makes many public appearances on behalf of the cause. He also participates in an annual fundraising event called the &quot;Black Woods Blizzard Tour,&quot; a snowmobile excursion around northern Minnesota which raises money to fight the deadly disease. As of 2019, Hrbek and his then-wife, Jeanie Hrbek, were honorary co-chairs of the ALS Association&#x27;s MN/ND/SD Chapter. He was awarded the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 1991 for his efforts.

<doc id="848130" wikidata="Q136693" url="?curid=848130" title="Norman architecture">
<text>The term Norman architecture is used to categorise styles of Romanesque architecture developed by the Normans in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries. In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture. The Normans introduced large numbers of castles and fortifications including Norman keeps, and at the same time monasteries, abbeys, churches and cathedrals, in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded arches (particularly over windows and doorways) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style.

==Origins==
These Romanesque styles originated in Normandy and became widespread in northwestern Europe, particularly in England, which contributed considerable development and where the largest number of examples survived. At about the same time, a Norman dynasty that ruled in Sicily produced a distinctive variation–incorporating Byzantine and Saracen influences–also known as Norman architecture (or alternatively Sicilian Romanesque). 

The term Norman may have originated with eighteenth-century antiquarians, but its usage in a sequence of styles has been attributed to Thomas Rickman in his 1817 work &quot;An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation&quot;. In this work he used the labels &quot;Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular&quot;. The more inclusive term &quot;romanesque&quot; was used of the Romance languages in English by 1715, and was applied to architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries from 1819. 

Although Edward the Confessor built the original Westminster Abbey in Romanesque style (now all replaced by later rebuildings), its construction predates the Norman Conquest: it is still believed to have been the earliest major Romanesque building in England. No other significant remaining Romanesque architecture in Britain can clearly be shown to predate the Norman Conquest. However, historians believe that many surviving &quot;Norman&quot; elements in buildings–nearly all churches–may well in fact be Anglo-Saxon elements.

==Norman arch==
The Norman arch is a defining point of Norman architecture. Grand archways are designed to evoke feelings of awe and are very commonly seen as the entrance to large religious buildings such as cathedrals. Norman arches are semicircular in form. Early examples have plain, square edges; later ones are often enriched with the zig-zag and roll mouldings. The arches are supported on massive columns, generally plain and cylindrical, sometimes with spiral decoration; occasionally, square-section piers are found. Main doorways have a succession of receding semicircular arches, often decorated with mouldings, typically of chevron or zig-zag design; sometimes there is a tympanum at the back of the head of the arch, which may feature sculpture representing a Biblical scene. Norman windows are mostly small and narrow, generally of a single round-headed light; but sometimes, especially in a bell tower, divided by a shaft into two lights.

==Normandy==

Viking invaders arrived at the mouth of the river Seine in Normandy in 911, at a time when Franks were fighting on horseback and Frankish lords were building castles. Over the next century the population of the territory ceded to the Vikings (now called Normans) adopted these customs as well as Christianity and the &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;. Norman barons built timber castles on earthen mounds, beginning the development of motte-and-bailey castles, and great stone churches in the Romanesque style of the Franks. By 950, they were building stone keeps. The Normans were among the most travelled peoples of Europe, exposing them to a wide variety of cultural influences which became incorporated in their art and architecture. They elaborated on the early Christian basilica plan. Their churches were originally longitudinal with side aisles and an apse. They then began to add towers, as at the Church of Saint-Étienne at Caen, in 1067. This would eventually form a model for the larger English cathedrals some 20 years later, after they had invaded and conquered England.

==England==
In England, Norman nobles and bishops had influence before the Norman Conquest of 1066, and Norman influences affected late Anglo-Saxon architecture. Edward the Confessor was brought up in Normandy and in 1042 brought masons to work on the first Romanesque building in England, Westminster Abbey. In 1051 he brought in Norman knights who built &quot;motte&quot; castles as a defence against the Welsh. Following the invasion, Normans rapidly constructed motte-and-bailey castles along with churches, abbeys, and more elaborate fortifications such as Norman stone keeps.

The buildings show massive proportions in simple geometries using small bands of sculpture. Paying attention to the concentrated spaces of capitals and round doorways as well as the tympanum under an arch. The &quot;Norman arch&quot; is the rounded, often with mouldings carved or incised onto it for decoration. chevron patterns, frequently termed &quot;zig-zag mouldings&quot;, were a frequent signature of the Normans. The cruciform churches often had deep chancels and a square crossing tower which has remained a feature of English ecclesiastical architecture. Hundreds of parish churches were built and the great English cathedrals were founded from 1083.

After a fire damaged Canterbury Cathedral in 1174 Norman masons introduced the new Gothic architecture. Around 1191 Wells Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral brought in the English Gothic style, and Norman became increasingly a modest style of provincial building.

==Scotland==
Scotland also came under early Norman influence with Norman nobles at the court of King Macbeth around 1050. His successor Máel Coluim III overthrew him with English and Norman assistance, and his queen, Margaret, encouraged the church. The Benedictine order founded a monastery at Dunfermline. Her sixth and youngest son, who became King David, built St. Margaret&#x27;s Chapel at the start of the 12th century.

==Ireland==
The Normans first landed in Ireland in 1169. Within five years earthwork castles were springing up, and in a further five, work was beginning on some of the earliest of the great stone castles. For example, Hugh de Lacy built a Motte-and-bailey castle on the site of the present day Trim Castle, County Meath, which was attacked and burned in 1173 by the Irish king Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair. De Lacy, however, then constructed a stone castle in its place, which enclosed over three acres within its walls, and this could not be burned down by the Irish. The years between 1177 and 1310 saw the construction of some of the greatest of the Norman castles in Ireland. The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and among other buildings they constructed were Swords Castle in Fingal (North County Dublin), Dublin Castle and Carrickfergus Castle in County Antrim.

==Italy==

===Mezzogiorno===
The Normans began constructing castles, their trademark architectural piece, in Italy from an early date. William Iron Arm built one at an unidentified location (Stridula) in Calabria in 1045. After the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085, the Mezzogiorno (peninsular southern Italy) experienced a series of civil wars and fell under the control of increasingly weaker princes. Revolts characterised the region until well into the twelfth century and minor lords sought to resist ducal or royal power from within their own castles. In the Molise, the Normans embarked on their most extensive castle-building programme and introduced the &quot;opus gallicum&quot; technique to Italy. Their clever use of the local stone artisans, together with the vast riches amassed from their enslaved population, made such tremendous feats possible, some as majestic as those of the ancient Roman structures they tried to emulate.

Besides the encastellation of the countryside, the Normans erected several religious buildings which still survive. They edified the shrine at Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo and built a mausoleum to the Hauteville family at Venosa. They also built many new Latin monasteries, including the famous foundation of Sant&#x27;Eufemia Lamezia. Other examples of great importance are the portal of the Shrine of Mary Queen of Anglona and the ambulatory and radiating chapels of the Aversa Cathedral.

Here is a list of Norman architecture in the Mezzogiorno : 
* Castle of Circello. 
* Castle Monforte (Campobasso).
* Basilica of St. Peter Alli Marmi (Salerno)

===Sicily===


Sicily&#x27;s Norman period lasted from until about 1200. The architecture was decorated in gilded mosaics such as that at the cathedral at Monreale. The Palatine Chapel in Palermo built in 1130 is perhaps the strongest example of this. The interior of the dome, (itself a Byzantine feature), is decorated in a mosaic depicting Christ Pantocrator accompanied by his angels.

During Sicily&#x27;s later Norman era early Gothic influences can be detected such as those in the cathedral at Messina consecrated in 1197. However, here the high Gothic campanile is of a later date and should not be confused with the early Gothic built during the Norman period; which featured pointed arches and windows rather than the flying buttresses and pinnacles later to manifest themselves in the Gothic era.

===Malta===
After its Norman conquest in 1091, Malta saw the construction of several Norman pieces of architecture. Many have been demolished and rebuilt over the years (especially after the 1693 Sicily earthquake which destroyed many old Norman buildings), however some fortresses and houses still exist in Mdina and Vittoriosa.

==Transitional style==
As master masons developed the style and experimented with ways of overcoming the geometric difficulties of groin vaulted ceilings, they introduced features such as the pointed arch that were later characterised as being Gothic in style. Architectural historians and scholars consider that a style must be assessed as an integral whole rather than an aggregate of features, and while some include these developments within the Norman or Romanesque styles, others describe them as transitional or &quot;Norman–Gothic Transitional&quot;. A few websites use the term &quot;Norman Gothic&quot;, but it is unclear whether they refer to the transitional style or to the Norman style as a whole.

==Neo-Norman==

Neo-Norman architecture is a type of Romanesque Revival architecture based on Norman Romanesque architecture. There is sometimes confusion, especially in North America, between this style and revivalist versions of vernacular or later architecture of Normandy, such as the &quot;Norman farmhouse style&quot; popular for larger houses.

Romanesque Revival versions focus on the arch and capitals, and decorated doorways. There are two examples in Manchester: the former Stock Exchange building and a synagogue in Fallowfield.

<text>Sarah Fielding (8 November 1710 – 9 April 1768) was an English author and sister of the playwright, novelist and magistrate Henry Fielding. She wrote &quot;The Governess, or The Little Female Academy&quot; (1749), thought to be the first novel in English aimed expressly at children. Earlier she had success with her novel &quot;The Adventures of David Simple&quot; (1744).

==Childhood==
Sarah Fielding was born at East Stour, Dorset in 1710 to Edmund Feilding &quot;[sic]&quot; and his wife Sarah, &quot;née&quot; Gould (died 1718), after Henry and Ursula; her younger siblings were Anne, Beatrice, and Edmund. Sarah&#x27;s father, Edmund, the third son of John Feilding, was a military officer and relative of the Earls of Denbigh (his father, John, had been the youngest son of the 3rd Earl). Although Edmund spelled his last name &quot;Feilding&quot; as often as &quot;Fielding,&quot; both Henry and Sarah spelled the name &quot;Fielding.&quot; When asked by an Earl of Denbigh why, Henry Fielding said, &quot;I cannot tell, my Lord, except it be that my branch of the family were the first that knew how to spell&quot;. Sarah Fielding&#x27;s mother, Sarah Gould, was the daughter of Sir Henry Gould, a judge on the King&#x27;s Bench who had been reappointed to the Queen&#x27;s Bench. This descent is important for understanding the early life and education of Edmund Feilding&#x27;s children.

Edmund left the care of his children to his wife&#x27;s mother, Lady Sarah Gould, while he built his career in London. The children grew up in her home in Glastonbury and their paternal grandfather&#x27;s house in East Stour (John Feilding being a latitudinarian Cambridge-educated parish priest with three livings, who had been considered for a bishopric in Ireland. Henry was sent to Eton, but all of the daughters were sent to Mary Rookes&#x27;s boarding school in Salisbury. This was &quot;non-academic, but she was later extremely well read in Greek, Latin, French and English.&quot;

When Edmund&#x27;s first wife (Fielding&#x27;s mother) died in 1718, Edmund married Anne Rapha, a Roman Catholic widow, who brought with her several children, and later bore Edmund a son and half-brother for Henry and Sarah, the future reformer John Fielding. Sir Henry and Lady Sarah Gould (Fielding&#x27;s maternal grandparents) had fallen out with Edmund before the death of the children&#x27;s mother. Lady Gould was highly displeased with Edmund&#x27;s second marriage, and Anne Fielding (née Rapha) was the subject of much anti-Catholic sentiment from the elder generation of the family. Lady Gould was so set against Anne and her enlargement to the family that, in 1721, she sued for custody of the children and ownership of the family house in East Stour. She eventually won, leaving the children unable to see their father for some years.

==Writing career==

In the 1740s, Fielding moved to London, sometimes living with her sisters and sometimes with her brother Henry and his family. The women of the family lacked sufficient money for a dowry, and consequently none married. Even when Lady Gould died in 1733, there was little money for the children.

Fielding turned to writing to make a living, beginning while she lived with her brother and acted as his housekeeper. In 1742, Henry Fielding published &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot;, and Sarah Fielding is often credited with having written the letter from Leonora to Horatio (two of the characters in the book). In 1743, Henry Fielding published his &quot;Miscellanies&quot; (containing his life of Jonathan Wild), and his sister may have written its narrative of the life of Anne Boleyn.

In 1744, Fielding published a novel, &quot;The Adventures of David Simple in Search of a Faithful Friend&quot;. As was the habit, it was published anonymously, while pleading financial distress. The novel was quite successful and gathered praise from contemporaries, including the publisher and novelist Samuel Richardson. As a &quot;moral romance&quot;, it features two disinherited couples. Both heroines point to &quot;the stifling of women&#x27;s intellect and the barriers against a gentlewoman&#x27;s earning her living.&quot; It was followed by the &quot;Familiar Letters&quot; (1747) of the two couples and by a &quot;Volume the Last&quot; added to a later edition (1753). Richardson, who was himself the target of Henry Fielding&#x27;s satire, said that he thought Sarah and Henry were possessed of equal gifts of writing. &quot;The Adventures of David Simple&quot; went into a second edition within ten weeks, and was translated into French and German. The title pages to Sarah Fielding&#x27;s other novels often carried the advertisement that they were written by &quot;the author of David Simple&quot;. The novel was sufficiently popular that Fielding wrote &quot;Familiar Letters between the Principal Characters in David Simple&quot; as an epistolary furtherance to the novel in 1747. In 1753, she wrote a sequel to &quot;The Adventures of David Simple&quot; entitled &quot;David Simple: Volume the Last&quot;.

&quot;David Simple&quot; was one of the earliest sentimental novels, featuring a wayfaring hero in search of true friendship who triumphs by good nature and moral strength. He finds happiness in marriage and a rural, bucolic life, away from the corruptions of the city. Simple is an analogue, in a sense, of the figure of Heartsfree, in Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Wild&quot; and Squire Allworthy in his &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. However, he also shares features with other sentimental figures who find peace only with escape from corruption and the harmony of a new Utopia. In her &quot;Volume the Last&quot;, however, Fielding&#x27;s fiction, like Henry Fielding&#x27;s, is darker and shows less faith in the triumph of goodness in the face of a corrosive, immoral world.
Sarah Fielding wrote three other novels with original stories. The most significant of these was &quot;The Governess, or The Little Female Academy&quot; (1749), which is the first novel in English written especially for children. In addition, she wrote &quot;The History of the Countess of Dellwyn&quot; (1759) and &quot;The History of Ophelia&quot; (1760).

As a critic, Sarah Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Remarks on Clarissa&quot; (1749) concern the novel &quot;Clarissa&quot; by Samuel Richardson. As a biographer, she wrote &quot;The Lives of Cleopatra and Octavia&quot; (1757), a history, written from Greek and Roman sources, on the lives of Cleopatra and Octavia, two famous women of Roman times. As a translator she produced &quot;Xenophon&#x27;s Memoirs of Socrates&quot;, with the &quot;Defense of Socrates Before His Judges&quot; (1762), a work by the Ancient Greek writer and soldier Xenophon concerning the philosopher.

==Final years==
Fielding&#x27;s sisters died between 1750 and 1751 and Henry in 1754. Fielding retired from London and moved to a small house just outside Bath. The famous philanthropist Ralph Allen and the similarly famous Elizabeth Montagu (a member of the Blue Stockings Society) gave her some financial aid. In about 1767, the novelist Sarah Scott, sister of Elizabeth Montagu, invited Fielding to come and live with her in a female utopian community, as an attempt to create the utopia described in &quot;Millenium Hall&quot;, but Fielding declined. She died in 1768. There is a memorial plaque to her on the west porch of Bath Abbey.
