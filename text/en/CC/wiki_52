<text>The Northstar engine is a family of high-performance 90° V engines produced by General Motors between 1993 and 2011. Regarded as GM&#x27;s most technically complex engine, the original double overhead cam, four valve per cylinder, aluminum block/aluminum head V8 design was developed by Oldsmobile R&amp;D, but is most associated with Cadillac&#x27;s Northstar series.

Displacing in its basic form, the direct family line transitioned to longitudinal and supercharged versions. Variants were used at Oldsmobile (as the Aurora L47 V8 and &quot;Shortstar&quot; LX5 V6), as well as in several top-end 2000s Pontiacs and Buicks.

The related Northstar System was Cadillac&#x27;s trademarked name for a package of performance features introduced in mid-1992 that coupled the 4T80E transmission, a 100,000 mile service interval, road sensing suspension, variable power steering, and 4-wheel disc brakes to the Division&#x27;s high-output and high-torque Northstar engines.

GM ceased production of the Northstar in 2011. The final cars to receive it, the Cadillac DTS, Buick Lucerne, and Cadillac STS, rolled off the line in 2011. It was replaced by the GM LS small-block OHV engine, used in newer Cadillac V8 models like the CTS-V, marking a step back to a simpler, more reliable pushrod engine design. These LS V8 engines were the only V8 engines used by Cadillac for the next eight years, until the clean sheet Blackwing V8 was introduced in 2018 in the 2019 Cadillac CT6-V. A Cadillac-exclusive, it was discontinued after just two years in early 2020.

== Development and features ==
GM initiated what ultimately became the Northstar&#x27;s design at Oldsmobile R&amp;D some time in 1984 in anticipation of the advanced dual overhead cam V8 engines to be introduced by European and Japanese competitors later in the decade. At that time, Cadillac was using the aluminum &quot;HT&quot; Overhead Valve (OHV) V8 which GM pushed hastily into production because the CAFE standards for 1982 would preempt using 1981&#x27;s V8-6-4. At the time it was GM&#x27;s corporate policy not to pass the gas guzzler tax on to the consumer.

Cadillac was developing new models which they hoped would compete against the best luxury cars from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Asian rivals like Lexus, Acura, and Infiniti. GM developed a laundry list of items to be included in the Allanté and updated Eldorado and Seville STS, including sophisticated steering, braking, and suspension technologies, and an engine exclusive to &quot;Cadillac&quot; the Division&#x27;s dealers were clamoring for. This group of features became known as the &quot;Northstar System&quot;. Central to it was a high-tech V8 with the performance and sophistication to compete with an ever-expanding list of imported challengers.

Capable of producing out of its displacement, the Northstar featured a cast aluminum 90° V8 block with bore spacing split into unitary upper and lower halves. The lower crankcase assembly supported the crankshaft without conventional main bearing caps. An oil manifold plate with an integrated silicone gasket forms the oil gallery under this. A typical oil change used of oil.

GM specified cast-iron cylinder liners and the cast aluminum pistons included valve clearance. Northstar is an interference engine: the valves will strike the pistons if they lose timing. It has bronze piston pin bushings and free-floating piston pins. GM used cast aluminum cylinder heads featuring 4 valves per cylinder. The heads used dual overhead cams driven through the &quot;maintenance-free&quot; cam-drive chain case. The cams act directly on hydraulic lifters on the ends of the valves and are fed with a lubrication passage drilled through the cylinder head lengthwise. The intake valves are inclined at 25°, while the exhaust valves are canted to 7° with center-mounted platinum-tipped spark plugs. The cam covers are magnesium for light weight and sound damping.

Sequential fuel injection was delivered via eight thermoplastic tubes. Ignition was distributorless, with a waste spark setup. The powertrain control module (PCM) controlled spark and fuel injection timing as well as the shift points for the new four-speed, transverse GM 4T80 transmission. All engines of this family share the same Northstar bellhousing pattern.

One notable feature advertised at the time was the &quot;limp home&quot; fail-safe mode, which allowed the engine to continue running for a limited time without any coolant. Supplying fuel to only one cylinder bank in turn, the engine would &quot;air cool&quot; the inactive bank. This technique, combined with its all-aluminum construction and large oil capacity, allows the engine to maintain safe temperatures, allowing a Northstar-equipped car to be driven with no coolant for about without damage. Another unusual feature of some heavily electronic-laden Northstar-equipped cars such as the Seville, DeVille, and Eldorado is a liquid-cooled alternator. Although this was intended to prolong alternator life, GM reverted to a traditional air-cooled setup for 2001 to eliminate potential leak points and extraneous tubing.

Later developments included direct coil-on-plug ignition, roller lifters, and variable valve timing, which can vary intake by up to 40° and the exhaust by up to 50°. VVT was devised for the longitudinal LH2 version, and was not used on the transverse front wheel drive engines due to packaging considerations.

== Northstar series ==
The engine was introduced in mid-1992 in the 1993 Cadillac Allanté; in 1996 the Northstar became the standard engine on all Cadillacs except the Fleetwood, but was phased out of all Cadillac models by 2011. The Northstar engine was used on all Northstar equipped Cadillacs while the Deville Concours, Eldorado ETC, Seville STS, and in 2000 the Deville DTS, were fitted with the version. The original Northstar Allanté also introduced the &quot;Northstar System&quot; which included traction control, adaptive suspension, and antilock brakes. Early Northstars required premium grade gasoline to maximize performance.

The Northstar was sold exclusively by that name by Cadillac for over a decade before being introduced in the 2004-2005 Pontiac Bonneville and 2006 Buick Lucerne. However, the &quot;L47&quot; V8 Northstar variant was used in the Oldsmobile Aurora the 3.5L &quot;LX5&quot; V6 in the Oldsmobile Intrigue and Oldsmobile Shelby Series 1. The LH2 engine variant received a forged steel crankshaft in October 2003. The LD8 and L37 variants received a forged crankshaft for the 2006 model year. Cadillac had planned to introduce a V12 Northstar this decade, likely for use in the Escalade, but economics and new CAFE standards killed the idea.

Most Northstar engines produce , with power reaching as high as in the supercharged LC3. The engines were revised for 2000 with coil-on-plug ignition and roller follower valvegear for improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. Though power output did not change, this update made premium fuel merely recommended, rather than required.

All but the supercharged Northstars displaced with a bore and stroke. For better head gasket sealing between cylinders, the supercharged version is de-bored to for a total displacement of . The block is believed to be capable of expansion up to 5.4 L, though no such engine has been produced.

The Northstar was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1995, 1996, and 1997.

The 4.6L V8 engine found in models from 1995-2005 were notorious for failure due to a design flaw involving the use of torque-to-yield bolts in the head gasket. Essentially, these type of bolts are stretched beyond their elasticity upon installation, ultimately increasing wear and fatigue on the bolt and decreasing its service life. The high load of the engine would eventually cause these bolts to weaken and loosen in their threads, rupturing the seal and in turn blowing the head gasket.

===Northstar System===
The &quot;Northstar System&quot; was Cadillac&#x27;s trademarked name for a package of automobile performance features introduced in mid-1992 on the 1993 Cadillac Allanté and later on the 1993 Seville and Eldorado.

The &quot;Northstar System&quot; included the following components:
** &quot;L37&quot; high-output and 
** &quot;LD8&quot; high-torque and 
* Variable valve timing (VVT), a continuously variable system throughout the rpm range, increasing fuel economy.
: GM engines use the double overhead cam, varying both intake and exhaust for better performance.
* GM 4T80-E 4-speed automatic transmission
* &quot;Road Sensing Suspension&quot; (RSS), which monitored damping rates of the shock absorbers every 15 milliseconds, selecting between two settings.
: RSS was available in both standard and CV-RSS (continuously-variable) systems.
* 4-wheel disc brakes with Bosch antilock brakes
* &quot;Magnasteer&quot; speed-variable power steering, which combines conventional hydraulic power steering and magnetized &quot;doughnuts&quot; mounted around the output shaft, which stiffen the steering as vehicle speed increases.

Later versions of the Northstar engine included the 4.6L and LH2 which began in 2004, and supercharged 4.4L LC3 created for the STS-V which are detailed below.

=== L37 ===
The L37 (VIN &quot;9&quot;) was the original Northstar. It is tuned for responsiveness and power, while the later LD8 is designed for more sedate use. The L37 code had been used on all high-output transverse Northstars, even as the exact engine specifications evolved. The compression ratio for the L37 is 10.3:1 for engines built prior to 2000, and 10.0:1 afterwards.

The original L37 was specified at , but 1993 production examples were rated at . The engine topped out at from 1996 through 2004 on the STS, DTS and ETC models, making these some of the most powerful domestic front wheel drive cars ever built. For 2005 the L37 was named &quot;Northstar NHP&quot;, and was downrated to under the new SAE certified horsepower rating system. In 2006, the updated DTS &quot;Performance Package&quot; model got a slight bump to .
Vehicles using the L37 include:
=== LD8 ===
The LD8 (VIN &quot;Y&quot;) is a transverse V8 for front-wheel drive cars. Introduced in 1994, it is designed to provide more torque than the high-revving L37. The LD8 code had been used on all torque-tuned transverse Northstars, even as the exact engine specifications evolved. Compression ratio is 10.3:1 for engines built prior to model year 2000, and 10.0:1 for those built afterwards. The 1998 revision is quieter than previous Northstar engines, due to hydraulic engine mounts, and performs better due to a tuned intake system.

Most LD8 Northstars are rated at and .

=== LH2 (VIN &quot;A&quot;)===
The Northstar was designed originally for transverse front-wheel drive applications. It was modified substantially in 2004 for longitudinal rear- and all-wheel drive use in the STS, SRX, and XLR, as well as receiving continuously variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust sides. The RWD (LH2) Northstar produces and . The addition of variable valve timing enables most of the increase in power from the L37 and LD8 Northstars.
=== LC3 ===
A supercharged Northstar was used in the 2006 Cadillac STS-V and Cadillac XLR-V. The bore was reduced for increased strength and improved head gasket sealing. Variable valve timing is used on both the intake and exhaust sides. The STS-V engine produces at 6400 rpm and at 3900 rpm with 9.0:1 compression and the XLR-V engine produces at 6400 rpm and at 3900 rpm.

=== L47 ===

The L47 Aurora engine was a special V8 designed for the Oldsmobile Aurora, based on the Northstar engine, used during the 1995-1999 and 2001-2003 model years. It is a DOHC V8 which produced and of torque. The bore and stroke was . The L47 had a 10.3:1 compression ratio and used premium fuel.

Although most of the Northstar&#x27;s features, including the coolant loss system, remained intact, the decreased bore increased weight unacceptably. To reduce it, Oldsmobile used a one-piece glass-filled thermoplastic intake manifold and simplified AC Rochester sequential fuel injection. A new die-cast structural aluminum oil pan incorporated baffling to reduce oil starvation in hard driving. A starter interlock prevented the starter from engaging if the quiet L47 was already running.

An early version or prototype of this engine was used in the 2nd generation Oldsmobile Aerotech. A highly modified version of this engine was used by General Motors racing division initially for IMSA sports car competition in an Oldsmobile Aurora GTS-1 and Riley&amp;Scott LMP prototypes in 1995, Indy Racing League competition starting in 1997, then was later used in the Cadillac Northstar LMP program in 2000. Both engines retained the 4.0 L displacement, but the Northstar LMP version was twin-turbocharged. The Aurora was also used in the Shelby Series 1 car.
In the inaugural DTM season, Opel would debut their Astra with a V8 derived from the L47.

The Aurora engine was introduced in 1994 for the 1995 model year, and General Motors has not used this engine since the retirement of Oldsmobile in 2004.

== LX5 (Shortstar) ==
The LX5 is a DOHC V6 from Oldsmobile, introduced in 1999 with the Intrigue. It was produced by the &quot;Premium&quot; engine group at GM and was thus called the Premium V6, or PV6, while it was being developed. It is based on the L47 Aurora V8, which is itself based on the Northstar engine, so engineers called it the Short North, though Oldsmobile fans have taken to calling it the Shortstar.

Although it has a 90° V-angle like the Northstar, the engine block was engineered from scratch, so bore centers are different. It has chain-driven dual overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, but is an even-firing design with a split-pin crankshaft similar to the Buick 3800 engine. The LX5 displaced and produced at 5,600 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. Bore and stroke is . It was also one of GM&#x27;s first engines to use coil-on-plug ignition. Compression ratio is 9.3:1.

The cost of building this engine was high, and it was not used in many vehicles. It was said at the time that a family of premium V6s would follow, with displacements ranging from 3.3 L to 3.7 L, but only the LX5 was ever produced before GM discontinued the Shortstar in favor of their current flagship V6, the High Feature engine, in 2004.

The LX5 was entirely different from any other V6 in the GM inventory - the only other DOHC V6 engines ever offered by GM included the Chevrolet Twin Dual Cam produced from 1991-1997, which was made by modifying the traditional Chevy 60-degree OHV block V6 for the dual overhead cams rather than building a DOHC engine from the ground up, and the Cadillac/Holden HFV6 available from 2004 to the present day. These three designs are completely unrelated and leave two gaps in 1998 and 2003 where no DOHC V6 was available from GM (except for the 54 degree Opel V6 used most notably in the first generation Cadillac CTS at launch as well as the Saturn L Series and Catera). This contrasts starkly with competitors practices of evolving engineering over multiple, continuously improving designs. As with the Aurora V8, production stopped with the demise of Oldsmobile.

The 3.5L LX5 was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1999 and 2000.

<text>Thymallus thymallus, the grayling or European grayling, is a species of freshwater fish in the salmon family Salmonidae. It is the only species of the genus &quot;Thymallus&quot; (the graylings) native to Europe, where it is widespread from the United Kingdom and France to the Ural Mountains in Russia, and Balkans on the south-east, but does not occur in the southern parts of the continent. It was introduced to Morocco in 1948, but it does not appear to have become established there.

==Description==
The grayling grows to a maximum recorded length of and a maximum recorded weight of . Of typical &quot;Thymallus&quot; appearance, the grayling proper is distinguished from the similar Arctic grayling (&quot;T. arcticus arcticus&quot;) by the presence of 5–8 dorsal and 3–4 anal spines, which are absent in the other species; &quot;T. thymallus&quot; also has a smaller number of soft rays in these fins. Individuals of the species have been recorded as reaching an age of 14 years.

The grayling prefers cold, clean, running riverine waters, but also occurs in lakes and, exceptionally, in brackish waters around the Baltic Sea. Omnivorous, the fish feeds on vegetable matter, as well as crustaceans, insects and spiders, mollusks, zooplankton, and smaller fishes, such as Eurasian minnows. Grayling are also prey for larger fish, including the huchen (&quot;Hucho hucho&quot;).

With the Arctic grayling, &quot;T. thymallus&quot; is one of the economically important &quot;Thymallus&quot; species, being raised commercially and fished for sport.

The grayling is a protected species listed in Appendix III of the Bern Convention. It has become critically endangered in the Baltic Sea.
The term &quot;grayling&quot; is often used to refer generically to the &quot;Thymallus&quot; species, and &quot;T. thymallus&quot; is sometimes called the European grayling for clarity. There are many obsolete synonyms for the species.

&quot;Thymallus thymallus&quot; is the type species of its genus.

==Angling==
The grayling is known as the &#x27;lady of the stream&#x27;. In Europe, they used to be persecuted by anglers for the false perception that they stopped trout colonizing stretches of rivers and streams. However, research has shown that grayling and trout feed on different prey items and generally prefer different microhabitats within rivers and streams but do occupy similar niches to smaller, less-predatory trout.

In England and Wales, they can be fished throughout the coarse fishing season (16 June to 14 March), providing thrilling sport on the fly when the trout season is closed. There is no closed season for grayling in Scotland; where they have been introduced. There are no grayling in Ireland. Well-known grayling flies include the grayling witch, klinkhamers, various nymphs and &#x27;red tags&#x27;, along with other trout patterns. Flies tied to resemble small pink shrimps have also been found to be useful. A method known as &#x27;Czech-nymphing&#x27; has been known to be helpful to anglers where grayling shoal up in colder periods. The method involves moving a series of Czech nymphs under the tip of the fly rod with the flow of the river and the nymphs should entice the grayling to take one. Fly-anglers may wade in the river to perform this method where they can access deeper water. Wading does not necessarily spook the grayling as they are generally less cautious than trout and are not as easily put off by human presence.

In France, too, the season is limited depending upon several factors. The Allier is one of the rare places in Southern Europe where the common grayling occurs in a natural habitat.

<text>The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (AFEM) is a military award of the United States Armed Forces, which was first created in 1961 by Executive Order of President John F. Kennedy. The medal is awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces who, after July 1, 1958, participated in U.S. military operations, U.S. operations in direct support of the United Nations, or U.S. operations of assistance for friendly foreign nations. 

== Appearance==
The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal is issued as a bronze medal, 1 inches in diameter.

The obverse side of the medal consists of an eagle, with wings addorsed and inverted (representing the strength of the United States Armed Forces), standing on a sword loosened in its scabbard, and super- imposed on a radiant compass rose of eight points, (representing the readiness to serve wherever needed) all within the circumscription &quot;ARMED FORCES&quot; above and &quot;EXPEDITIONARY SERVICE&quot; below with a sprig of laurel on each side. On the reverse side of the medal is the shield from the United States Coat of Arms above two laurel branches separated by a bullet, all within the circumscription &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot;.

The ribbon is 1 inches wide and consists of the following stripes: inch Green, inch Golden Yellow, inch Spicebrown, inch Black, inch Bluebird, inch Ultramarine Blue, inch White, inch Scarlet, inch Bluebird, inch Black, inch Spicebrown, inch Golden Yellow and inch Green.

Ribbon devices

A bronze service star is authorized for participation in subsequent U.S. military operations authorized for award of the AFEM (only one award is authorized for each designated U.S. military operation). A silver service star is worn in lieu of five bronze service stars.

The Arrowhead device is authorized for United States Army, United States Air Force, and United States Space Force personnel who are awarded the medal through participation in an airborne or amphibious assault.

The Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia is authorized for U.S. Navy service members assigned to Marine Corps units that participate in combat during the assignment.

== Criteria==
The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal may be authorized for three categories of operations: U.S. military operations; U.S. military operations in direct support of the United Nations; and U.S. operations of assistance for friendly foreign nations. 
The medal shall be awarded only for operations for which no other U.S. campaign medal is approved, where a foreign armed opposition or imminent threat of hostile action was encountered.

Since its original conception in 1961, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal has been awarded for United States participation in over forty five designated military campaigns. The first campaign of the AFEM was the Cuban Missile Crisis and the award was issued for military service between October 1962 and June 1963. Following this original issuance, the AFEM was made retroactive to 1958 and issued for actions in Lebanon, Taiwan, Republic of the Congo, Quemoy and Matsu, and for duty in Berlin between 1961 and 1963.

During the early years of the Vietnam War, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was issued for initial operations in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was intended to replace the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal and Navy Expeditionary Medal, but this never occurred and both services continue to award their service expeditionary medals and the AFEM, though not concurrently for the same action.

In 1965, with the creation of the Vietnam Service Medal, the AFEM was discontinued for Vietnam War service. As the Vietnam Service Medal was retroactively authorized, those personnel who had previously received the AFEM were granted the option to exchange the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for the Vietnam Service Medal. In 1968, the AFEM was awarded for Naval operations in defense of the , which was seized by North Korea, as well as for Korean Service, and awarded for Thailand and Cambodia operations in 1973. Because of these awards during the Vietnam War period, some military personnel have been awarded both the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal &amp; the Vietnam Service Medal. Some military advisers involved in the 1973 Arab–Israeli War were also awarded the medal for their involvement in the supply and training of the IDF on the use and deployment of anti-tank weapons.

In the 1990s, it was awarded to numerous Naval ships such as who enforced the Dayton Peace Accords and operated in the Adriatic Sea enforcing UN arms embargo against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and participating in Operation Sharp Guard and Operation Joint Endeavor up through and during the Bosnian crisis.

In 1993, Somalia, (The Battle of Mogadishu), also known as the Black Hawk Down Incident, was part of (Operation Gothic Serpent). Operation Gothic Serpent was a military operation conducted in Mogadishu, Somalia, by an American force code-named (Task Force Ranger) during the Somali Civil War in 1993. The (Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal) was awarded to numerous Naval ships in the Amphibious Squadron 5, the USS New Orleans (LPH-11), USS Denver (LPD-9), USS Comstock (LSD-45), and USS Cayuga (LST-1186).

In 2003, with the creation of the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the AFEM was discontinued for Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. After 18 March 2003, some personnel became eligible for the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, as well as the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. Only one medal may be awarded, however, and individuals or units that deployed to the Gulf for Operation Southern Watch, and then immediately transitioned to Operation Iraqi Freedom, are not eligible for both medals.

Beginning in 1992 an effort was begun to phase out the AFEM in favor of campaign specific medals and the newly created Armed Forces Service Medal. The Armed Forces Service Medal was also originally intended to be a replacement for the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, however the two awards are currently considered separate awards with different award criteria. The primary difference between the two is that the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal is normally awarded for combat operations and combat support missions.

==Approved operations==

===U.S. military operations===

After the close of the Vietnam War, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was issued for various military operations in Panama, Grenada, and Libya Operation El Dorado Canyon.

=== U.S. operations in direct support of the United Nations===
The medal is also authorized for several United Nations actions, such as peacekeeping efforts in Somalia.

=== U.S. operations in direct support of NATO operations===
The medal is also authorized for NATO peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

=== U.S. operations of assistance for a friendly foreign nation===
The AFEM has been issued for numerous operations in the Persian Gulf, most notably Operation Earnest Will, which began in 1987 and lasted until the eve of Operation Desert Shield. Following the close of Desert Storm, and the engagement in peacekeeping and sanction missions against Iraq, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was issued again for several operations such as Operation Northern Watch, Operation Southern Watch, and Operation Vigilant Sentinel.

==Similar awards==

Similar awards of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal:

The Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (the AFEM is no longer issued for operations in the Middle East, but may be reactivated for future campaigns which may not qualify for either the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal). Similar in nature to the AFEM, the GWOTEM is awarded for deploying abroad on or after Sept. 11, 2001 (and a future date to be determined), for service in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Service stars are also authorized for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal effective February 9, 2015, retroactive to September, 11, 2001. Each service star represents a deployment in support of an approved GWOT operation. Only one GWOT-EM is awarded for each operation (five bronze service stars are authorized for six approved deployment operations). The GWOT-EM approved operations by inclusive dates are:

:Enduring Freedom: September 11, 2001 – present
:Iraqi Freedom: March 19, 2003 - August 31, 2010 
:Nomad Shadow: November 5, 2007 – present
:New Dawn (Operation Iraqi Freedom renamed): September 1, 2010 – December 31, 2011
:Inherent Resolve: June 15, 2014 – present
:Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel: January 1, 2015 – present

The Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal. In the modern era, service members who were authorized one of these medals are occasionally permitted to choose between receipt of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal or the service specific expeditionary medal. The AFEM and the Navy/Marine Expeditionary Medal cannot be bestowed simultaneously for the same action.

The Air and Space Expeditionary Service Ribbon. Although similar in name, this award is unrelated to the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and is presented for duty performed on U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force deployments.

<text>USS &quot;Miller&quot; (DD-535) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy, named after Medal of Honor recipient Acting Master&#x27;s Mate James Miller.

&quot;Miller&quot; was laid down 18 August 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Co., San Francisco, California; launched 15 February 1943; sponsored by Mr. William P. Upshur; and commissioned 31 August 1943.

== 1944 ==

&quot;Miller&quot;, assigned to the Pacific in Destroyer Squadron 52 (DesRon 52) throughout her World War II service, departed 20 November 1943, for Pearl Harbor. There she conducted exercises until 22 January 1944, interrupted by an escort mission to Makin. On the 23rd she got underway and sailed west with Task Force 51 (TF 51). For the next month she provided screening and gunfire support services as that force assaulted and occupied Kwajalein and Eniwetok. She departed the latter 24 February for Majuro where she joined the Fast Carrier Task Force (then 5th Fleet&#x27;s TF 58, later 3rd Fleet&#x27;s TF 38), with which she operated for the remainder of the war.

On 22 March the aircraft carriers, supported by battleships and cruisers, and screened by a ring of destroyers, departed Majuro with &quot;Miller&quot; in the outer ring of steel. Completing strikes at Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai (29 March–1 April) they returned briefly to Majuro and then headed for New Guinea where they supported Army assault forces with raids on Hollandia, Wakde, Sewar, and Sarmi (21 April–22 April) and then raided Truk, Satawan, and Ponape (29 April–1 May).

Next the force hit Marcus and Wake Islands (19 May–23 May) and then prepared for the Marianas campaign. On 6 June the carrier force sortied from Majuro again. From the 11th through the 17th its planes and ships ranged from the Volcano and Bonin Islands to the southernmost Marianas, supporting the assault on Saipan and preventing Japanese reinforcements from reaching that beleaguered island and the next target, Guam. On the 17th, after screening the carriers during flight operations for strikes against Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guam, &quot;Miller&quot; received word of a Japanese Fleet approaching from the Philippines. On the 18th she continued to cover the assault forces on Saipan while waiting for the expected engagement. On the 19th she was on the starboard quarter of as enemy dive bombers opened the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Throughout the 2-day battle, which tore the muscle from the Japanese naval air arm, she remained in that carrier&#x27;s screen, splashing one enemy plane and damaging another.

After brief upkeep at Eniwetok, &quot;Miller&quot; got underway to rendezvous with the remainder of the task force for further strikes on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima (3–4 July) and Palau, Ulithi, and Yap (23–27 July). On 30 August the force sailed to support the landings in the Palaus by conducting raids against Palau, Mindanao, Leyte, Luzon, and Samar (7–24 September). In October, operating from Ulithi, the task force prepared for the return to the Philippines with strikes on enemy installations in shipping in the Ryūkyūs, on Taiwan, and in the South China Sea. On the 20th, it commenced support of amphibious operations on Leyte and Samar. Five days later &quot;Miller&quot; joined the screen of Task Group 34.5 (TG 34.5), then operating with TG 38.2. The two groups then sailed to assist TF 77 which had engaged an enemy force in Surigao Strait in an opening phase of the epic Battle of Leyte Gulf.

Shortly after midnight, while patrolling the waters at the eastern end of San Bernardino Strait, TG 34.5 sighted an enemy destroyer. After several exchanges of gunfire, &quot;Miller&quot; and closed in to finish off the target, accomplishing their missions in under 20 minutes.

&quot;Miller&quot; then rejoined TF 38 which had resumed air operations against the Philippines. The force raided air installations on Luzon, Leyte, and Samar into November, receiving, on the 19th, its first taste of a new Japanese tactic, the kamikaze. Six days later several of the suicide planes broke through the screen of planes and destroyers to score hits on the carriers , , and . With slight damage, except to &quot;Intrepid&quot;, the force retired to Ulithi. Thence the force sortied, 11 December, to support amphibious operations on Mindoro, and keep Japanese air forces pinned to the ground. Next came strikes on Taiwan, followed by another return to the Philippines to support amphibious operations, this time in Lingayen Gulf.

== 1945 ==

After the Luzon landings, the force stepped up its sorties into the South and East China Seas. It struck repeatedly at enemy installations from Saigon to the Ryukyus and frequently sailed northeast to raid the industrial heart of the Japanese Islands. On 19–21 February 1945 they supported the invasion of Iwo Jima and then steamed west again towards Tokyo. By 1 March they had begun an intensified raiding campaign against the Ryukyus and Japan, again preparing the way for an invasion force.

&quot;Miller&quot;, participating in these raids on Okinawa, Kyūshū, and Honshū, was near when an enemy dive bomber penetrated the screen to drop several 500-pound bombs on the carrier, 19 March. The destroyer went alongside to aid in the rescue and firefighting operations and then covered the carrier&#x27;s withdrawal, for which actions she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. Her captain LCDR Dwight L. Johnson was awarded the Navy Cross.

&quot;Miller&quot; rejoined the fast carriers 8 April as they provided air cover for ground forces embattled on Okinawa. Into June she screened the carriers and rescued downed pilots as the force struck at military and industrial concentrations from the southern Ryukus to Kyūshū. On the 20th, she was detached from TF 38 and ordered back to the United States for navy yard availability. She arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, 9 July, and was still moored there when the war ended.

== 1945–1964 ==

On 19 December 1945 &quot;Miller&quot; decommissioned and joined the Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California. She remained there until 19 May 1951, when she recommissioned and joined the Atlantic Fleet with Newport, Rhode Island as her homeport. On 6 September 1952 the destroyer departed the East Coast for Korea and a round-the-world cruise. Arriving at Sasebo, Japan, 11 October, she got underway for gunfire support and interdiction fire duty with TF 95 off the Korean coast. Remaining on station in the combat area almost continuously until February 1953, &quot;Miller&quot; also served with TF 77 screening carriers as they conducted air operations against North Korean ground forces. On 11 February she departed for home, via the Mediterranean. After her return to Newport she resumed operations along the East Coast with periodic deployment in the Mediterranean. In 1958, while serving with the 6th Fleet. she participated in that fleet&#x27;s swift response to the request of President Camille Chamoun of Lebanon for tangible aid to prevent a threatened coup d’etat.

In 1959 &quot;Miller&quot; was detached from service with the active fleet and reported for Naval Reserve training duty at Boston 9 March. Whilst in Boston, a cadet from the training ship MV
&quot;Rakaia&quot; swam across the harbour at night and raised the Soviet flag on her flag mast as a joke. As a training ship, USS &quot;Miller&quot; conducted cruises for more than 11,000 reservists. October 1961 President John F. Kennedy activated her reserve crew during the Berlin Wall Crisis. On 30 March 1964 she sailed for Norfolk, Virginia. There, on 30 June, she was decommissioned and reentered the Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Miller&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1974. She was sold 31 July 1975 and broken up for scrap.

<doc id="859316" wikidata="Q2943245" url="?curid=859316" title="Cavanal Hill">
<text>Cavanal Hill (officially Cavanal Mountain), located near Poteau, Oklahoma, is described by a sign at its base as the &quot;&#x27;World&#x27;s Highest Hill&#x27; – Elevation: 1,999 feet&quot;. The actual summit elevation is above sea level; the difference in elevation between the summit and the Poteau River to the north is .

== Hill / mountain ==
The billing is based on a delineation between a hill and a mountain, that being if the geographical feature were 2,000 feet or higher than its base, then it would be classified as a mountain instead of a hill. However, the United States Geographic Names Information System contains thousands of summits with &quot;hill&quot; in their names which are higher than 2,000 feet.

==Etymology==
One source claims that the name is derived from a French word meaning &quot;cave&quot;: . Oklahoma historian Muriel H. Wright wrote that &quot;cavanol&quot; is a corruption of the French word , meaning &quot;cavernous.&quot;

==History==
Cavanal Hill was a notable landmark for French explorers who traveled this area in the 18th century and gave the landmark its name. During the late 1700s, French fur trappers established a camp at the base of Cavanal and named it Poteau, for &quot;Post&quot;. Thomas Nuttall studied plant life here in 1819, and learned about other natural wonders from local French trappers and Indians who were living here.

During territorial times Cavanal Hill was along the border of Skullyville County and Sugar Loaf County, two of the constituent counties making up the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

In the late 1800s, Walter Beard established a health resort at the summit of Cavanal Hill. This was a modest wood-frame structure that catered to visitors in the area. Besides the view, the major draw was the natural springs that occur throughout the region.

Halfway up Cavanal Hill, George Witte established the town of Witteville. This was a coal mining company town. The mines were located three miles east of the town. Witteville is still marked on some maps, and can be found at the &quot;Y&quot; leading up to the top of Cavanal Hill. Much of the road leading up to the top of the hill was part of the original railroad that led to Witteville.

In the 1960s, Senator Robert S. Kerr established a summer residence at the foot of Cavanal Hill. This summer house was located on the same site where Walter Beard first established his health resort.

==Recreation==
Cavanal Hill is now the site of mountain bike races and the Cavanal Hill Killer 5-Mile Walk. A blacktopped road leads to the summit where visitors can enjoy picturesque views of the Poteau River Valley. Reportedly, one can see Mount Magazine in Arkansas from here on a clear day.

<text>Phinney Ridge is a neighborhood in north central Seattle, Washington, United States. It is named after the ridge which runs north and south, separating Ballard from Green Lake, from approximately N. 45th to N. 80th Street. The ridge, in turn, is named after Guy C. Phinney, lumber mill owner and real estate developer, whose estate was bought by the city and turned into Woodland Park in 1899. Phinney&#x27;s estate had included a private menagerie, and the western half of the park became what is now the Woodland Park Zoo.

==Routes==
The rough boundaries of Phinney Ridge are Aurora Avenue N. (State Route 99) to the east, beyond which lies Green Lake and the eastern half of Woodland Park; N. 75th Street to the north, beyond which lies Greenwood; 8th Avenue N.W. to the west, beyond which lies Ballard, and N. 50th and Market Streets to the south, beyond which lies Fremont and Wallingford. Phinney Ridge&#x27;s main thoroughfare, which runs atop the ridge south of N. 67th Street, is Phinney Avenue N. North of N. 67th Street, the arterial swings a block to the west and becomes Greenwood Avenue N. The route is lined with many small businesses and shops, as well as the Phinney Neighborhood Association, located at the corner of Phinney and 67th. It has occupied the former John B. Allen Elementary School building, which was built in 1904, since 1981, when the school closed.

==Wildlife==
Wildlife in the area, especially adjacent to Woodland Park, has always been a subject of discussion; at least two medium-sized (8-15 individuals) Coyote packs are known to inhabit the area feeding off the large population of released domestic rabbits that also called the park home until February 2006.

<text>Henry Eustace McCulloch (December 6, 1816 – March 12, 1895) was a soldier in the Texas Revolution, a Texas Ranger, and a brigadier general in the army of the Confederate States during the American Civil War.

==Early life==

McCulloch was born in Rutherford County, Tennessee, one of twelve children of Scots-Irish American Alexander McCulloch and French-American Frances Fisher LeNoir. Henry&#x27;s father Alexander, a Yale University graduate, was a descendant of Captain Nicolas Martiau, the French Huguenot settler of Jamestown, Virginia and ancestor of President George Washington. Alexander was also an officer on Brig. Gen. John Coffee&#x27;s staff during the Creek War of 1813 and 1814 in Alabama; his mother was a daughter of a prominent Virginia planter. The family had been wealthy, politically influential, and socially prominent in North Carolina before the American Revolution, but Alexander McCulloch had wasted much of his inheritance and was unable even to educate his sons. (Two of Henry McCulloch&#x27;s older brothers briefly attended a school in Tennessee taught by their neighbor, Sam Houston.) After several moves, the family settled at Dyersburg, where one of their closest neighbors was Davy Crockett—a great influence on both McCulloch and his older brother, Ben McCulloch, who also would become a Confederate brigadier general.

==Texas career==
Henry McCulloch shared in his brother Ben&#x27;s economic attempts in the 1830s, including transporting goods by raft on the Mississippi, once all the way to New Orleans. When Davy Crockett went to Texas in 1835, Henry McCulloch and his brother made plans to meet Crockett&#x27;s Tennessee Boys at Nacogdoches on Christmas Day. However, Ben contracted measles and was bedridden for several weeks and while ill convinced his brother Henry to return to Tennessee in November 1835. Luckily, the illness kept them from arriving with Crockett at the Alamo.

In 1838, both Henry and Ben McCulloch were making a living as surveyors. They also made a reputations as Indian fighters. Both took part in the Battle Creek Fight against the Comanche Indians in Navarro County, also known as &quot;The Surveyors&#x27; Fight&quot;. In 1839, Henry McCulloch was on the muster roll of Capt. Mathew Caldwell&#x27;s &quot;Gonzales Rangers&quot;. Also in 1839, Ben was elected to the Republic of Texas House of Representatives after a contentious campaign that included assorted slanders between the candidates. As a result, Ben fought a rifle duel with his opponent, Reuben Ross and received a permanently crippling wound in the arm. The matter was considered closed but it flared up again the following year, this time involving Henry, who killed Ross with a pistol.

On August 20, 1840, McCulloch married Jane Isabella Ashby, daughter of John Miller Ashby and Mary Harris Garnett of Kentucky, who had been early settlers in the DeWitt Colony, which was centered on Gonzales. They had twelve children, most of whom remained in Texas.

Later in 1840, McCulloch took part in the Battle of Plum Creek, acting as a scout against the Comanches and being wounded. When a Mexican raiding force under Gen. Adrian Woll invested San Antonio in September 1842, he served as First Lieutenant of a company of volunteers from Seguin. He again operated as a scout, including infiltrating enemy lines, and commanded a spy company at the Battle of Salado Creek. With his brother, Ben, he subsequently took part in the failed Somervell expedition and both men were ordered to leave shortly before most of the Texans were captured at Mier, Mexico in Tamaulipas, December 25, 1842.

He was elected sheriff of Gonzales in 1843 and also opened a mercantile business there. The following year, he moved his family permanently to Seguin.

There are several letters written in the 1890s (now in the possession of the Texas State Library) in which McCulloch describes his (and his brother&#x27;s) activities during the Texas Revolution and under the Republic.

In December 1847, McCulloch was in command of a Ranger company in Burnet County and established what became Fort Croghan. When the War with Mexico began, he took command of a volunteer company patrolling the same area of the western frontier against Indian raids. He continued this service after the war as captain of a company of Texas Mounted Volunteers out of Fort Murrill, and also operating a Ranger post in Kimble County.

He served in both houses of the Texas Legislature from Guadalupe County, being elected to the House of Representatives in 1853 and the Senate in 1855. Among other subjects, he introduced bills to regulate the use by slaveowners of &quot;manager slaves&quot; and to acquire the Alamo as a state monument. He then received an appointment as U.S. marshal from President Buchanan for the eastern district of Texas, and was a delegate from Guadalupe County to the Texas secession convention in January 1861. {His brother Ben had been 1852 US Marshal for the eastern District of Texas}

==Civil War==
A few days after the convention voted for secession from the union on February 1, 1861 (though before the necessary referendum), the Texas Committee of Public Safety established a Provisional Army, in which McCulloch received a commission as colonel. On March 4, he was appointed commander of the 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment, also known (especially to its officers) as the 1st Texas Mounted Rifles. The unit was recruited from several counties in central Texas to serve for twelve months and was the first Texas cavalry regiment to enter Confederate service. Its mission was to maintain a line of patrol from the Red River southwest to the junction of the Concho and North Concho Rivers, a point near present-day San Angelo.

McCulloch was acknowledged by his superiors and others for his emphasis on precise discipline and gentlemanly conduct in his regiment. His training methods included complex cavalry and infantry maneuvers as well as sabre-fighting and the proper care of horses and equipment. Many Texas units maintained only lax rules of propriety and organization, but the 1st Texas remained a cohesive and loyal unit, disbanding only under the proper orders.

After receiving word of the action at Fort Sumter, McCulloch moved five companies to confront any federal troops remaining in Texas who had not yet embarked at the port of Indianola, but en route he received orders from Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to intercept a federal force northwest of San Antonio. On May 9, McCulloch&#x27;s troops, numbering some 1,300, captured the 8th U.S. Infantry near San Lucas Springs.

Late in June, McCulloch crossed the Red River with Maj. Edward Burleson to ensure the friendliness (or at least the neutrality) of the Wichita and Caddo Indians, following this with a warning that any raids across the river into Texas would bring retaliation—and over the following year, there were in fact a number of engagements between elements of the 1st Texas and Indian raiding parties. The success of the Texas troops in suppressing these raids is shown in the fact that the number of raids actually decreased during 1861 and 1862 from the numbers reported in previous years.

In September 1861, McCulloch, now a brigadier general, assumed temporary command of the Department of Texas until the arrival of Brig. Gen. Paul O. Hébert, and in December was named to command the new Western Military District, comprising that part of the state west and south of San Antonio. Early the next year, he was ordered to assume co-command of Texas State Troops being sent to Arkansas.

On September 6, 1862, following the death near Little Rock of his co-commander, Allison Nelson of Waco, McCulloch took command of the new Texas Division and organized it into four brigades, ultimately taking command of the Third Brigade himself while the division as a whole was under the command of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker. The division was attached to the District of Arkansas, Trans-Mississippi Department, and by April 1863 it was in Louisiana, where it took part in the Red River Campaign, the Camden Expedition, and the Battle of Milliken&#x27;s Bend, which was an early phase of the Vicksburg campaign. In July 1863, the division arrived in Alexandria, Louisiana, where McCulloch was replaced by Col. George M. Flournoy. McCulloch was approached as a candidate for governor of Texas late that summer, but declined in order to remain on active service.

In 1864 and 1865, McCulloch was again in north Texas and in charge of the Western Sub-District of Texas (the entire District now being under the command of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder), where he was active not only in dealing with Indian raids but in pursuing and arresting Confederate deserters and bushwhackers. At the end of the war, on his return to his home in Seguin, he found it necessary to travel with an armed escort because of threats against his life by deserters.

==Postbellum career==
In 1874, he was active early in the administration of Gov. Richard Coke, especially in helping to physically remove Edmund J. Davis from the executive offices. In 1876, as a reward for his services to Texas, he was appointed superintendent of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum (later the Texas School for the Deaf) in Austin. Though a respected military commander, he proved an inept civil administrator and a legislative investigation forced him to resign his position in 1879; he was succeeded in that office by Col. John S. &quot;Rip&quot; Ford, his old commander in the Rangers.

The retired general apparently enjoyed his retirement, frequently receiving distinguished visitors in his home, giving interviews and engaging in correspondence with inquiring historical writers, and was in regular demand as a speaker at July Fourth festivities throughout central Texas. He was also a trustee in the local Methodist Church. Henry E. McCulloch died March 12, 1895, at Rockport, Texas, and was buried in San Geronimo Cemetery in Seguin. He received a full masonic funeral, having been an active freemason after the War in the Guadalupe County lodge. His widow, Jane Ashby McCulloch died in 1896.

Camp Henry McCulloch was located at &quot;Nuner&#x27;s Mott&quot;, about four miles north of the present city limits of Victoria in Victoria County. It was the training site in the fall of 1861 for several infantry and cavalry companies of the 6th Texas Infantry Regiment, CSA (at the time when McCulloch was interim commander of the Department of Texas). A Texas state historical marker was erected at the site.

The Gen. Henry E. McCulloch Camp #843 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Texas Division, Central Texas Brigade, is located in Brownwood, Texas.

==Popular culture==
His wife, Jane Isabella Ashby McCulloch, was a sister of Sarah Ashby McClure and Euphemia Ashby King, two of the main characters Janice Woods Windle&#x27;s historical novel &quot;True Women&quot;, which was made into a TV movie.

<text>John Fredrick Thomas Jane (6 August 1865 – 8 March 1916) was an English author, war gamer, and founding editor of &quot;All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; and &quot;All the World&#x27;s Airships&quot;.

==Biography==
Jane was born in Richmond, Surrey, England, but worked most of his life in Portsmouth. His father was a Church of England vicar. He attended Exeter School. He first began to sketch warships in his teens. In the 1890s he illustrated scientific romances by George Griffith, as well as for his own science fiction novels, such as &quot;To Venus in Five Seconds&quot; (1897), and &quot;The Violet Flame&quot; (1899).
Jane first published &quot;All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; (known as &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; after 1903) in 1898, which detailed the world&#x27;s navies. It was an immediate success, becoming the standard reference work on the topic. &quot;The Naval Warrant Officer&#x27;s Journal&quot; suggested that the book be on every ship, and in 1902 said that it should be available to every naval officer. The Admiralty were less enthusiastic, partly due to Jane&#x27;s irreverent behaviour - although many ships did acquire copies.

In 1909, he created &quot;All the World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot;.

Jane&#x27;s firm has passed through a number of ownership entities. IHS is the current publisher.

Jane was an accomplished maritime and naval artist whose works were widely published. Those illustrations are now collectable.

He was also involved in politics, standing as an Independent candidate for Portsmouth in the 1906 general election. He was strongly opposed to the Liberal Party (especially its left wing) and when a left-wing Liberal candidate Edward Hemmerde was nominated in 1910, he arranged a stunt to disrupt their election campaign. At another public meeting, Jane arranged for a sailor to ask Hemmerde to insist on the supply of hammock ladders should he be elected: Hemmerde fell for this gag and gave the pledge. He also once kidnapped MP Victor Grayson in a political stunt.

His Portsmouth home, on Southsea Common, now bears a plaque recording that he lived there.

In later life Jane lived at Bedhampton, and was instrumental in setting up one of the first Boy Scout troops.

Jane&#x27;s health had been in decline when he contracted an influenza virus in December 1915. Complications of this virus, and congestive heart failure, would shortly prove fatal. On March 8, 1916, Jane passed at his home in Clarence Parade, Southsea, Portsmouth. He was survived by his second wife Muriel, and his daughter, Dorothy. He was buried with his first wife, Alice, in Highland Road Cemetery, Southsea.

==Legacy==
Jane&#x27;s Information Group, publisher of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; and newer editions of &quot;Jane&#x27;s All The World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; is named after Jane.

&quot;Jane&#x27;s Combat Simulations&quot;, a brand of combat simulation video games, is named after him; licensed from Jane&#x27;s Information Group.

<text>Satam Muhammad Abd al-Rahman al-Suqami (; June 28, 1976September 11, 2001) was a Saudi terrorist hijacker. He was one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 as part of the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Al-Suqami was recruited into al-Qaeda around 1999, along with Majed Moqed, who was one of the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77. He traveled to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where he would be chosen to participate in the 9/11 attacks.

He arrived in the United States in April 2001. On September 11, 2001, al-Suqami boarded American Airlines Flight 11 and participated in the hijacking of the plane so that it could be crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the coordinated attacks. He is believed to have perpetrated the first fatality of the attacks in killing passenger Daniel Lewin in the process of hijacking the plane. Al-Suqami died along with everyone else on the plane on impact with the North Tower.

==Early life==
Little is known about the early life of Satam al-Suqami. A native of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, he had very little education. At some point in his life, al-Suqami reportedly worked as a security guard for a hospital in Ta&#x27;if. He appeared to be unconcerned with religion, engaged in drinking, and may have had problems with drug and alcohol abuse. He was not known by Saudi authorities to be engaged in extremist activities, but he had a minor criminal record in the country. Most Saudi muscle hijackers developed their ties to extremism inside Saudi Arabia, often in local mosques, and most started to break contact with their families in 1999 or 2000. Al-Suqami reportedly travelled to Afghanistan in 1999 along with Majed Moqed (eventual hijacker of American Airlines Flight 77). Both trained for al-Qaeda at Khalden training camp, a large training facility in Paktia province that was run by Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi. Both al-Suqami and Moqed seem not to have any ties to each other or to any other al-Qaeda operatives before getting involved with extremism, most likely in 1999.

==Career==
The FBI says al-Suqami first arrived in the United States on April 23, 2001, with a visa that allowed him to remain in the country until May 21. However, at least five residents of the &quot;Spanish Trace Apartments&quot; claim to recognize the photographs of both al-Suqami and Salem al-Hazmi, the younger brother of 9/11 hijacker Nawaf al-Hazmi, as living in the San Antonio complex earlier in 2001. However, these residents and several others who claim to have known the hijackers, claim that the FBI photographs of al-Suqami and al-Hazmi are reversed. Other reports conflictingly suggested that al-Suqami was staying with Waleed al-Shehri in Hollywood, Florida, and rented a black Toyota Corolla from Alamo Rent-A-Car agency.

On May 19, al-Suqami and Waleed al-Shehri took a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Freeport, Bahamas where they had reservations at the &quot;Princess Resort&quot;. Lacking proper documentation however, they were stopped upon landing, and returned to Florida the same day and rented a red Kia Rio from a Avis Car Rental agency.

He was one of nine hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on July 3 he was issued a Florida State Identification Card. Around this time, he also used his Saudi license to gain a Florida drivers&#x27; license bearing the same home address as Wail al-Shehri. (A Homing Inn in Boynton Beach). Despite this, the 9/11 Commission claims that al-Suqami was the only hijacker to not have any US identification.

During the summer, al-Suqami and brothers Wail and Waleed al-Shehri purchased one month passes to a Boynton Beach gym owned by Jim Woolard. (Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi also reportedly trained at a gym owned by Woolard, in Delray Beach.)

Known as &quot;Azmi&quot; during the preparations, al-Suqami was called one of the &quot;muscle&quot; hijackers, who were not expected to act as pilots. CIA director George Tenet later said that they &quot;probably were told little more than that they were headed for a suicide mission inside the United States.&quot;

==September 11 attacks and death==
On September 10, 2001, al-Suqami shared a room at the Milner Hotel in Boston with three of the Flight 175 hijackers, Marwan al-Shehhi, Fayez Banihammad, and Mohand al-Shehri.

On the day of the attacks, al-Suqami checked in at the flight desk using his Saudi passport, and boarded American Airlines Flight 11. At Logan International Airport, he was selected by CAPPS, which required his checked bags to undergo extra screening for explosives and involved no extra screening at the passenger security checkpoint.

Al-Suqami was seated in business class, in seat 10B, directly behind Daniel Lewin, co-founder of Akamai Technologies and a former member of the Israeli Sayeret Matkal (seated in 9B), and two rows behind hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari (seated in 8D and 8G, respectively). According to the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, the hijacking started around 8:14 a.m.. The hijackers stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui, slashed passenger Daniel Lewin&#x27;s throat and stormed the cockpit. Flight attendants on the plane who contacted airline officials from the plane reported that Lewin was fatally stabbed by the terrorist sitting behind him, this being Satam al-Suqami.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11Report&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One version of events is that al-Suqami attacked Lewin, unprovoked, to frighten other passengers and crew into compliance. Alternativelly, Lewin, who had been an officer in the elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces, may have attempted to confront Atta or Omari, who had been seated in front of him, not knowing that al-Suqami was sitting just behind him. Lewin was identified as the first victim of the September 11 attacks.

Al-Suqami died along with all other still alive occupants of the flight when hijacker-pilot Mohamed Atta deliberatelly crashed it into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. Al-Suqami&#x27;s passport was found by a passerby in the vicinity of Vesey Street, who delivered it to a NYPD officer, before the towers collapsed. This was one of four of the hijackers&#x27; original paper passports that totally or partially survived the attacks (the other being the passports of Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi, recovered from the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93, and that of Abdul Aziz al Omari, found intact in the luggage that did not make it in time into American Airlines Flight 11 during his and Atta&#x27;s rushed check-in in Logan Airport from their connecting flight from Portland, Maine). Digital copies of other hijackers&#x27; passports were later found in post-9/11 investigations. According to a January 2004 testimony before the 9/11 Commission by lead counsel Susan Ginsburg, al-Suqami paper passport had &quot;clearly&quot; been &quot;manipulated in a fraudulent manner in ways that have been associated with al-Qaeda.&quot;, a tactic used during the planning of the September 11 attacks to hide parts of the terrorists&#x27; travel histories, namely to Taliban-occupied Afghanistan.

<text>Professor Cuthbert Calculus ( , meaning &quot;Professor Tryphon Sunflower&quot;) is a fictional character in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. He is Tintin&#x27;s friend, an absent-minded professor and half-deaf physicist, who invents many sophisticated devices used in the series, such as a one-person shark-shaped submarine, the Moon rocket, and an ultrasound weapon. Calculus&#x27;s deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only slightly hard of hearing in one ear, occasionally making use of an ear trumpet to hear better.

Calculus first appeared in &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (more specifically in the newspaper prepublication of 4–5 March 1943), and was the result of Hergé&#x27;s long quest to find the archetypal mad scientist or absent-minded professor. Although Hergé had included characters with similar traits in earlier stories, Calculus developed into a much more complex figure as the series progressed.

==Character history==

Calculus is a genius, who demonstrates himself throughout the series to be an expert in many fields of science, holding three PhDs in nuclear and theoretical physics, and planetary astronomy. He is also an experienced engineer, archaeologist, biologist and chemist. Many of his inventions precede or mirror similar technological developments in the real world (most notably the Moon rocket, but also his failed attempt at creating a colour television set). He seeks to benefit humankind through his inventions, developing a pill that cures alcoholism by making alcohol unpalatable to the patient, and refusing under great duress to yield his talents to producing weapons of mass destruction. Calculus is also shown to be in the midst of inventing steerable roller skates during The Red Sea Sharks, although the final product is never shown, with the invention being only merely a sideshow in the overall plot. Much of Calculus&#x27;s more dangerous work is criticized by Captain Haddock, although Calculus usually interprets this the other way round: his deafness often leads him to misinterpret Haddock&#x27;s words, preventing him from hearing his real opinion.

Calculus&#x27;s deafness is a frequent source of humour in his interactions with other people, as he often repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. Additionally, he often diverts the subject of a conversation by responding to a misinterpreted remark. For example, &quot;But I never knew you had...&quot; leads Calculus to respond, &quot;No, young man, I am not mad!&quot; In the same book he believes that Tintin and Haddock are talking about his sister, before remembering a few moments later that he does not have a sister. He is not perturbed by his handicap, even if it is a source of deep frustration to his friends. He himself does not admit to being near-deaf and insists that he is &quot;only a little hard of hearing in one ear.&quot;

In the course of the &quot;Moon&quot; books, however, Calculus leads a team of scientists and engineers working on a major rocket project, motivating him to adopt an ear trumpet, and later a hearing aid, and for the duration of the adventure he has near-perfect hearing. This made him a more serious character, even displaying leadership qualities that had not been shown before or since. However, after completing the journey to the Moon, Calculus discarded his hearing aid, forcing his friends to readjust to his hearing impairment (aside from one panel in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, when Tintin is seen speaking to him through his ear-trumpet); this restored the humour surrounding him, though it could be that he finds his deafness useful since it enables him to focus on his work (something useful for &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, since he was referencing ultrasonic sound).

Calculus maintains a laboratory at Marlinspike Hall, in which he conducts various experiments. He is fairly protective of his work, on occasion hiding his scientific endeavours from Tintin and Haddock (which gets him into trouble in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;). His lab is also stripped of all its apparatus in the same book. On an earlier occasion, during his efforts to find an antidote to Formula Fourteen in &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, Calculus almost destroyed half of Marlinspike in an explosion.

Although generally a mild-mannered (if somewhat oblivious) figure, Calculus flies into an uncharacteristic rage if he feels insulted or ridiculed. He is especially provoked if he ever hears Haddock (or anyone else) call him a &quot;goat&quot;. On one famous occasion in &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, he displays uncontrollable ire (&quot;Goat, am I?&quot;) when an irritated Haddock accuses him of &quot;acting the goat&quot; (&quot;acting like a goat&quot; in the Golden Press American English translation) by attempting to build a Moon rocket. His subsequent tirade and blatant disregard for security terrifies the usually ebullient Captain; he even lifts the director of security barring his way onto a coat hook. Another occasion is in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; when, due to some misunderstanding, he physically assaults Laszlo Carreidas and has to be held back with great effort by Haddock and Tintin. In the same book, despite his deafness, he hears Captain Haddock tell him that he&#x27;s &quot;acting the goat&quot;, but Haddock quickly prevents the severe reaction from occurring. Earlier in &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; Calculus is shown with a frown for a few moments when he thinks that the Captain lied to him that Tintin had gone for a row, when Tintin actually was diving to search for treasure. Despite his gentle nature, Calculus is rather sensitive about his work and does not appreciate being ridiculed or belittled for his scientific efforts.

In spite of all this, his friends stick by him come what may. Haddock invited him to stay at Marlinspike Hall after Calculus discovered it is the captain&#x27;s ancestral home and bought it in his name thanks to money he had earned through selling the patent for his shark-submarine. He did this because Haddock and Tintin had provided him with the opportunity to test the submersible when they were searching for Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure. Tintin and Haddock crossed the world on at least two occasions (&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; and &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;) in order to save him from kidnappers.

He occasionally comments that he was a great sportsman in his youth, with a very athletic lifestyle. He is a former practitioner of the French martial art savate, although a demonstration in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; shows him to be more than a bit rusty.

==Inspirations==

Calculus is partly modeled on inventor Auguste Piccard (1884–1962), Hergé stated in an interview with Numa Sadoul: &quot;Calculus is a reduced scale Piccard, as the real chap was very tall. He had an interminable neck that sprouted from a collar that was much too large... I made Calculus a mini-Piccard, otherwise I would have had to enlarge the frames of the cartoon strip.&quot; The Swiss physics professor held a teaching appointment in Brussels when Hergé spotted his unmistakable figure in the street. In &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, Bianca Castafiore mentions that Calculus is &quot;famous for his balloon ascensions&quot;, an ironic reference to Piccard.

Philippe Goddin has suggested that Calculus&#x27; deafness was inspired by Paul Eydt, whom Hergé had known at &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; where Tintin&#x27;s adventures had first appeared. Cuthbert Calculus&#x27; original French name is &quot;Tryphon Tournesol&quot; and Tryphon was the name of Hergé&#x27;s plumber.

In contrast to his unquestionable scientific merits, Calculus is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Hergé himself was a believer in the subject: dowser Victor Mertens had used a pendulum to find the lost wedding ring of Hergé&#x27;s wife in October 1939.

==Calculus and his peers==
Before Calculus appeared in &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, Hergé had featured other highly educated but eccentric scholars and scientists, such as the following:

*Sophocles Sarcophagus of &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; who showed signs of being clumsy and forgetful before going completely mad.
*The absent-minded professor who appeared in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; and who forgot his glasses, wore his cleaning-lady&#x27;s overcoat, held his cane upside-down as if it were an umbrella, mistook a parrot for a man and left his briefcase next to a lamp post. In the original edition published in 1935 his name is given as Professor Euclide, after the Greek mathematician known as the &quot;Father of Geometry&quot;.
*Professor Hector Alembick in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, who had a bad habit of throwing his cigarettes on the floor.
*Two astronomers from &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; also showed unusual and, in one case, mad behaviour: Professor Philippulus, or &quot;Philippulus the prophet&quot; represented the dilemmas some face over religious belief and scientific research. In his case the conflict took a toll on his mind when the end-of-the-world appeared to be imminent. He then went around wearing bedsheets and beating a gong to warn of the event and later disrupted the eve of departure of the expedition sent to find a meteorite.
*His colleague, Professor Decimus Phostle, though not mad, looked forward to the end of the world whose prediction he thought would make him famous. In contrast, he showed signs of maturity during the expedition when he called off the search for the meteorite in order to help a ship in distress.

Calculus&#x27;s introduction appears to have supplied Hergé with the bizarre nature he wished to portray in a man of science. Other figures of high education were shown as more stable and level-headed. The members of the archaeological expedition who fall victim to &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; show no apparent signs of eccentricity. The most prominent member of this group is Calculus&#x27;s friend Hercules Tarragon, with whom he attended university. Tarragon is a large, ebullient man, possessing a jovial nature, but not necessarily eccentric.

While he sometimes appears aloof when absorbed in his work, Calculus corresponds with other scientists and also collaborates with many of them on his projects. He works with Mr. Baxter and Frank Wolff on the Moon rocket and corresponds with ultrasonics expert Professor Alfredo Topolino of Nyon in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;.

==Relationship to women==
Calculus is the only main character in the &quot;Tintin&quot; series to display signs of attraction to women. This is notably evident in his interactions with Bianca Castafiore, with whom he is smitten during her long stay at Marlinspike Hall in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. During her stay, his botanic experiments lead him to create a new variety of rose, which he names in her honour. Nonetheless, he happily congratulates Captain Haddock on his &quot;engagement&quot; to Castafiore (in fact a media hoax which he unwittingly fuelled).

Calculus is also distressed by Castafiore&#x27;s imprisonment in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;, and is adamant on going to her defence. In the same book, he is charmed by the unattractive Peggy Alcazar (wife of General Alcazar) and kisses her hand after she bluntly criticizes Tintin and Haddock (a remark that Calculus mistakes for a warm greeting).

==In other media==

Calculus also featured frequently in the 1957–1963 Belvision TV series, as well as in other adaptations of the comics. The Belvision TV series is notable for depicting Calculus with perfect hearing.

Calculus&#x27; original French name was &quot;Tournesol&quot; which is the French term for sunflower. In the 1970s and 1980s, he starred in a series of cartoon television commercials for Fruit d&#x27;or products which included cooking oil and mayonnaise made from sunflower oil. Some of the ads would conclude with him floating up into the air to demonstrate how they kept a good healthy balance. Other characters from the books were also included.

A pseudonym variation was used on an album by Stephen Duffy – see Tin Tin and &quot;Dr. Calculus&quot;.

<doc id="859357" wikidata="Q2816274" url="?curid=859357" title="34th Canadian Parliament">
<text>The 34th Canadian Parliament was in session from December 12, 1988, until September 8, 1993. The membership was set by the 1988 federal election on November 21, 1988, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1993 election.

It was controlled by a Progressive Conservative Party majority, led first by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the 24th Canadian Ministry, and then Prime Minister Kim Campbell and the 25th Canadian Ministry. The official opposition was the Liberal Party, led first by John Turner, and after 1990, by Jean Chrétien.

The speaker of the House of Commons was John Allen Fraser. See also list of Canadian electoral districts 1987-1997 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

<text>Georgy Yakovlevich Sedov (; – ) was a Russian Arctic explorer.

Sedov was born in the village of Krivaya Kosa of Taganrog district (now Novoazovskyi Raion, Donetsk Oblast) to a fisherman&#x27;s family. In 1898, he finished navigation courses in Rostov-on-Don and acquired the rank of long voyage navigator. In 1901, he took an external degree at a naval college, passed all the exams, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant.

From 1902 to 1903, Sedov participated in a hydrographic expedition in the Arctic Ocean. In 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War, he was in charge of a torpedo boat. In 1909, he led the expedition that would later describe the mouth of the Kolyma River. The following year, Sedov explored the Krestovaya Bay on Novaya Zemlya.

In 1912, he proposed a sleigh expedition for reaching the North Pole. The Tsarist government refused to finance this project and the expedition was organized with help from independent sources. On August 14 (27), 1912, Sedov&#x27;s ship &quot;Svyatoy Muchenik Foka&quot; (&quot;Saint Phocas the Martyr&quot;) left Arkhangelsk and had to stay for the winter near Novaya Zemlya because of impassable ice. The expedition reached Franz Josef Land only in August 1913; however, it had to stay for the second winter in the Tikhaya Bay due to lack of coal.

On February 2 (15), 1914, Sedov (already sick with scurvy) and his accompanying seamen G. Linnik and A. Pustotniy set off for the North Pole with their draft dogs. Before reaching Rudolf Island, Sedov died at sea and was buried at Cape Auk on the island. On the way back, at Franz Josef Land, the &quot;Svyatoy Foka&quot; rescued two survivors of the Brusilov expedition, including Valerian Albanov. As part of the search for the Sedov expedition, Jan Nagórski made the first airplane flights over the Arctic, gaining valuable experience for later aeronautical expeditions to the region.

Two gulfs and a peak on Novaya Zemlya, a glacier and a cape on Franz Josef Land, an island in the Barents Sea, and a cape in Antarctica bear Sedov&#x27;s name. There was also a steam icebreaker &quot;Georgy Sedov&quot;. Today, the sail training barque STS Sedov bears his name.

==Synopsis==
As secret agent Jim West entered a sailor&#x27;s shop on the wharf, he witnessed the death by strangulation of a man named Gilbert at the hands of an assassin named Torres. West tried to stop the murderer but bullets glanced harmlessly off the man, and the agent finally drove him off with a smoke pellet. West learned that Colonel &quot;Iron Man&quot; Torres (John Dehner), a former Army officer scarred and crippled by an accidental explosion and repaired by surgically implanted steel plates, systematically murdered six officers who he thought were responsible for his accident. He served with seven officers during the Civil War and believed they tricked him into pulling guard duty when his accident occurred. Nina (Sue Ann Langdon), Gilbert&#x27;s niece, appeared waving a picture of Torres and the other officers, the last one alive being President Ulysses Grant (Roy Engel). Fearing for Grant&#x27;s life, West and Gordon unsuccessfully tried to divert Grant away from his speech in a nearby town.

In order to pursue his vengeance, Torres learned the skills of &#x27;auto-suggestion&#x27; instead of anesthetics during surgery, and hypnosis, in the form of a spinning lampshade, which he used to regress the niece of his latest victim, Nina Gilbert, into a childlike personality and to control (or so he thought) Artemus Gordon. The hypnotizing of Nina was performed in disguise: with the backdrop of Bach&#x27;s Dorian Toccata and Fugue in D-Minor, he questioned her about her studies in psychology and made a reference to regression as he spun the lampshade; as he continued to talk about regression and later actively suggested it, her attention was caught by the bright flashing light in her eyes and she unknowingly went into a trance. Once entranced she was regressed into a laughing, empty-headed girl. She was later found by West as a carefree can-can dancer in a bar, with no memory of ever meeting West previously.

Torres used Nina to capture West. Dangling in front of 2 wireless remote-controlled rockets, one aimed at him, the other at Grant, West freed himself in time to prevent the rockets&#x27; launch and confronted Torres by an underground river. A fight ensued as West drove the ironman into the river, where he sank like a knight in armor.

In the end, Nina returned to normal, using the same lamp, but still provocatively dressed as a dancer, which provoked a fit of rage as she didn&#x27;t understand what occurred.

<doc id="859371" wikidata="Q1273342" url="?curid=859371" title="Ford Consul">
<text>The Ford Consul is a car that was manufactured by Ford of Britain from 1951 until 1962. The name was later revived for a model produced by Ford in both the UK and in Germany from 1972 until 1975.

Between 1951 and 1962, the Consul was the four-cylinder base model of the three-model Ford Zephyr range, comprising Consul, Zephyr, and Zephyr Zodiac. In 1956, the line was restyled. In 1962, the Consul was replaced by the Zephyr 4, the mid-range Zephyr model becoming the Zephyr 6, and the top-of-the-range Zephyr Zodiac just being called the Zodiac. At this point, Consul became a range of smaller cars in its own right, initially the Consul Classic and Consul Capri, shortly joined by the even smaller Consul Cortina. The Consul Classic was only made for two years (August 1961 - March 1963), before being replaced by the Consul Corsair. The Consul Capri was made from October 1961 until August 1964.

The Consul Classic, the Consul Capri, and the Consul Corsair (made from 1963 until 1970) were relatively short-lived, but the Ford Cortina, after losing (along with the Corsair) the &quot;Consul&quot; tag in 1964, went on to become a best-seller. The Consul name was again used by Ford from 1972 to 1975 on a replacement for the Zephyr range, now sharing a body with the more luxurious Ford Granada Mark I. The two-door coupé Capri&#x27;s name was also reintroduced in 1969, and survived until 1986.

==Ford Consul EOTA (1951–1956)==

The 1500 cc four-cylinder Consul was first shown at the 1950 London Motor Show. It was the start of Ford of Britain&#x27;s successful attack on the family saloon car market. With stablemate Zephyr, it was the first British Ford with modern unibody construction. The Zephyr Six replaced the larger-engined V-8 Pilot which had been made in only small numbers. The Consul was given the Ford code of EOTA. Most cars were four-door saloons with body design by George Walker of the parent United States Ford Motor Company, but a few estate cars were made by the coachbuilder Abbott. From 1953, a convertible conversion by Carbodies became available. Having lost most of its strength with its roof, the unibody was reinforced by welding in a large X-frame to the floor pan. Unlike the more expensive Zephyr, the hood (convertible top) had to be put up and down manually.

It was also the first car they built with up-to-date technology. The new 1508 cc engine had overhead valves, and hydraulic clutch operation was used, which in 1950 was an unusual feature. However, a three-speed gearbox, with synchromesh only on second and top, was retained. The Consul was also the first British production car to use the now-common MacPherson strut independent front suspension.

The bench front seat was trimmed in PVC, and the handbrake was operated by an umbrella-style pull lever under the facia (dash). The windscreen wipers used the antiquated vacuum system, but it came from a vacuum pump linked to the camshaft-driven fuel pump instead of the induction manifold as on Ford&#x27;s earlier applications of this arrangement. Clearly keen to keep things positive, a 1950 road test by the British &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine reported that the wipers were &quot;free from the disadvantage of early suction-driven wipers that dried up at wide throttle opening ... and spare[d] the battery&quot;. The initial dashboard was a flat, symmetrical panel with interchangeable instrument cluster and glovebox, but from September 1952, a redesigned asymmetrical dashboard was fitted, and the instruments, consisting of speedometer, ammeter, and fuel gauge, were positioned in a housing above the steering column, with a full-width parcel shelf on which an optional radio could be placed.

A car tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1953 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 28 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £732 including taxes.


==Ford Consul Mark II (1956–1962)==
In 1956, a new Consul appeared with the Ford code of 204E. The car was still the four-cylinder submodel of the Zephyr range, with which it shared the same basic body shell. Compared with the original, it had a longer wheelbase, larger 1703 cc, engine, and a complete restyle, borrowing cues from the 1956 models of America&#x27;s Thunderbird and Fairlane. One thing not updated was the windscreen wipers, which were still vacuum-operated. The roof profile was lowered in 1959 on the Mark II &#x27;lowline&#x27; version, which also had redesigned rear lights and much of the external bright work in stainless steel. Front disc brakes with vacuum servo appeared as an option in 1960 and were made standard in 1961 (four-wheel drum brakes only, in Australia). The name became the Consul 375 in mid-1961, It is designed to compete with the Morris Oxford Series III, Austin A55 Cambridge, and the Vauxhall Victor F.

The convertible version made by Carbodies continued. A De Luxe version with contrasting roof colour and higher equipment specification was added in 1957. The Australian market had factory-built versions of the coupé utility (pick up) and estate car (station wagon), as well as a locally engineered version of the saloon. They were also imported by Ford of Canada as a companion to the Falcon.

A Consul Mark II tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 23.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £781 including taxes. A 1960 Ford Consul Mark II was the taxi in which American singer Eddie Cochran died, and not, as many have stated, a London hackney cab.


==Ford Consul (Granada Mark I based: 1972–1975) ==

The Ford Consul name was revived in April 1972 for the lower-priced, lower-specification variants of the newly introduced Ford Granada. Developed jointly by Ford Britain and Ford of Germany, the cars were built in Cologne in West Germany and in Dagenham in the United Kingdom. Consul models can be identified by a two-panel cross-mesh grille as opposed to the horizontal chrome bar grille of the Granadas.

Consul, Consul L, and Consul GT models were offered and were available in two-door saloon, four-door saloon, two-door coupé, and five-door estate bodystyles. Unlike the previous Zephyr Estate, the Consul Estate was produced by Ford rather than by an outside contractor.

The 1663 cc Essex V4 and 1996 cc Essex V4 with 77 and 92 hp, respectively, and a 2495 cc Essex V6 with were the power units offered in the UK. In addition, the Consul GT was powered by the 2994 cc Essex V6 engine providing . Because it was less well equipped than the similarly powered Granada, it was about lighter and correspondingly quicker. In late 1974, the Essex V4 was replaced by the 2.0 litre Pinto engine.

In Germany, the Consul was offered with a choice of German-built Ford engines, starting with the 1699 cc Ford Taunus V4 engine familiar to drivers of the Ford Taunus 17M. The 2.0 litre straight-four and a 2.3 litre Cologne V6 were also available.

The Consul name was discontinued in late 1975 after the UK Court of Appeal ruled that Granada Group could not prevent Ford registering the name Granada as a trademark. The Granada name was then applied to all models.

<text>James C. Barbour (June 10, 1775 – June 7, 1842) was an American politician, planter, and lawyer. He served as a delegate from Orange County, Virginia, in the Virginia General Assembly and as speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates. He was the 18th Governor of Virginia and the first Governor to reside in the current Virginia Governor&#x27;s Mansion. After the War of 1812, Barbour became a U.S. Senator (from 1814 to 1825) and the United States Secretary of War (1825–1828).

==Early and family life==
James C. Barbour was born in what became Barboursville in Orange County on June 10, 1775. Barbour was the son of Thomas Barbour (who held a seat in the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1769) and his wife, the former Mary Pendleton Thomas. His grandfather (also James Barbour, 1707–1775) had patented lands in Spotsylvania County in 1731 and 1733, and his uncle of the same name James Barbour also served in the Virginia House of Burgesses (1761–65, representing Spotsylvania County). Both sides of his family were among the First Families of Virginia and early settlers in Orange County and westward. By the time James was born, the Barbour family had owned over 2,000 acres (8 km2) and enslaved several people. However, the family suffered financial reverses during the American Revolutionary War and its aftermath. Nonetheless, James finished his formal education with private tutors and an academy run by James Waddel at Gordonsville, Virginia. His brother, Philip P. Barbour, would later become Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

On October 29, 1792, Barbour married Lucy Johnson, the daughter of Benjamin Johnson, who had represented Orange County in the General Assembly in 1790. They had three daughters (one of whom, Frances, died as an infant in 1802); the second, Frances Cornelia, married William Collins of Baltimore. They also had four sons, including James Barbour and Benjamin Johnson Barbour (1821–1894, later rector of the University of Virginia).

==Career==

===Early years===
Barbour served as deputy sheriff of Orange County beginning in 1792. In 1794, he was admitted to the Virginia Bar. With wedding gifts from his father, as well as by building his legal practice and running his plantation, Barbour was able to build up personal wealth. His friend and neighbor at Monticello plantation, Thomas Jefferson, helped design the mansion in which Barbour lived most of his adult life, called Barboursville. By 1798, Barbour owned several enslaved people and would expand that plantation over the years, as would his somewhat neighbor on the other side, President James Madison at Montpelier plantation.

===House of Delegates===
Orange County voters elected Barbour to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1796, and he became that body&#x27;s youngest member. Reelected several times to that part-time position, he served until 1804 and again from 1807 to 1812. Barbour became known for eloquence, and served on various committees, rising to chairman of several, including the Committee of Privileges and Elections and the Finance Committee. Peers elected him as Speaker of the House of Delegates for many terms.

Barbour held strong Republican beliefs, similar to his neighbors Jefferson and Madison. He vigorously opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 and used his rhetorical eloquence to support the Virginia Resolutions. Barbour believed the Acts and their supporters threatened the United States, stating, &quot;to make an expected attack from abroad a pretext for attacking the principles of liberty at home has drawn aside the curtain and clearly illuminated for all who are willing to see.&quot; Barbour refused to support legislation increasing Executive powers, especially unchecked powers.

In the House of Delegates, Barbour took pride in writing the bill establishing the Literary Fund of Virginia, passed on February 2, 1810. This provided some funding for public education in each county in the Commonwealth. Barbour later requested that the only inscription on his tombstone be a reference to this Act, affirming his firm belief that society would progress only through education. However, he also believed intellectual abilities were connected with gender, race, and land ownership.

===Governor of Virginia===
In 1811, Barbour declared his candidacy for the governorship but lost to the incumbent, George William Smith. However, Smith died in office on December 26, 1811, during a fire at the Richmond Theatre. On January 3, the Legislature convened and elected Barbour governor. At the time, British raiders were impressing American sailors (including Virginians, especially near Hampton Roads and Norfolk). Barbour favored war with Britain, which he viewed as the only way to end British interference with U.S. sovereignty. Barbour&#x27;s father had trained the Orange militia, so the new Governor knew their inadequacies. Governor Barbour sought funding for Virginia&#x27;s militia on February 11, 1812, and personally toured the tidewater region most at risk.

On June 18, 1812, Congress declared war, so the War of 1812 began, and Barbour became &quot;the war governor.&quot; Perhaps because of his wartime preparations (or willingness to risk his funds), Barbour faced no opposition and was reelected Governor in November 1812. However, by 1813, British ships had been raiding coastal Virginia. Some delegates opposed Barbour&#x27;s support of President James Madison and national unity but nonetheless reelected him. In 1814, Barbour finally convinced the Legislature to approve raising 10,000 troops and placing that militia under Federal control. Washington D.C. was sacked before the Treaty of Ghent ended the war. Barbour also authorized exploration of the upper James River and received funding to improve Virginia roads. He was also the first Governor to inhabit the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Mansion, designed by Alexander Parris. Virginians sent resolutions thanking the Governor for his strong and apt leadership during the war.

===U.S. Senator===
On December 1, 1814, Virginia&#x27;s legislators elected Barbour (then 40) to succeed Richard Brent in the United States Senate. Although Barbour had previously opposed a national bank, President James Madison supported such, so Barbour became the Senate sponsor of a bill written by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander James Dallas, which authorized the National Bank with $50,000,000 in capital. It passed (although prior similar legislation failed).

Senator Barbour aligned with Senators John C. Calhoun and Henry Clay on internal improvements and slavery. Although his brother Philip P. Barbour served contemporaneously in the U.S. House, their stances and votes often differed. Senator Barbour proposed a committee on roads and canals, supported the Bonus Bill (authorizing spending the bonus from the national bank on internal improvements), and proposed a constitutional amendment to grant Congress the authority to appropriate money for internal improvements. Senator Barbour also opposed reducing the national army, supported a bill abolishing imprisonment for debts, and introduced the Navigation Act of 1818. That Act closed U.S. ports to any ships from British ports closed to U.S. ships. Barbour hoped this would encourage the British to open their ports. However, that effort failed. In 1823 a compromise led to the Elsewhere Act, which allowed for reciprocal trade.

Peers elected Barbour President pro tempore of the Senate in 1819. The 16th Congress, over which Barbour presided, adopted the Missouri Compromise on slavery. Barbour proposed combining the bill admitting Missouri (after he spoke in favor of allowing that state&#x27;s voters to elect to support slavery) with the bill admitting Maine—both in an attempt to deny the Northern Senators an opportunity to gain four anti-slavery Senators. His speech may have foreshadowed the Southern position in the American Civil War after his death:

As Senator, Barbour sponsored a resolution giving an honorary sword to Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky for his efforts in the Battle of the Thames in 1813. Johnson and Barbour would become quick friends following Barbour&#x27;s efforts. Later, Johnson promoted Barbour&#x27;s appointment as Secretary of War under President John Quincy Adams. However, that association with Adams, whom the Senate narrowly elected over Andrew Jackson, would later devastate both Senator Clay&#x27;s (and Barbour&#x27;s) political careers.

Virginia legislators elected the Jacksonian Democrat John Randolph of Roanoke to succeed Senator Barbour in December 1825. Like Barbour, he would defend slavery, although a member of the American Colonization Society like Henry Clay. Unlike Barbour, he would later emancipate the people he enslaved upon his death. Randolph opposed the national bank and the Missouri Compromise of 1820 that Barbour had helped Clay pass.

===Secretary of War===
Following Adams&#x27; inauguration on March 4, 1825, fellow Senators confirmed Barbour as Secretary of War and Henry Clay as Secretary of State. The War Department&#x27;s primary functions were managing the army and overseeing Indian affairs.

Barbour soon came into conflict with Governor George Troup of Georgia, who wanted to evict Creek Indians from 5 million acres (20,000 km2) of land. Northern Creeks had supported Britain in the War of 1812, and Georgia planters had engaged in the Red Stick War to acquire Southern Creek lands. However, those Southern Creeks assimilated and supported the Americans during the war. Governor Troup&#x27;s partially-Creek cousin William McIntosh had signed the Treaty of Indian Springs (1825), purporting to relinquish tribal lands in exchange for $200,000 for himself and installments totaling $200,000 for five other signatories. The U.S. Senate approved it by one vote on March 7, but tribal members protested vehemently, sentenced McIntosh to death, and killed him.

President Adams renegotiated the Treaty of Washington (1826) on slightly more favorable terms to the native peoples. Both treaties provided for removal west of the Mississippi (as President Jackson would later do the Cherokee Indians on the Trail of Tears). Governor Troup was upset that the second treaty allowed some Creek to remain in Georgia and began a survey to prepare to sell those remaining lands and threatened to call out the militia. At that point, the federal government ceased protecting the Indians. All Creeks&#x27; lands were seized, and all Creeks removed from Georgia by 1827.

===Diplomat===
By 1826, President Adams was deeply unpopular compared to his opponent in 1824 (and presumptive in 1828), Andrew Jackson, as was Secretary of State Clay. Although some advocated Barbour as a vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming 1828 elections, Barbour sought an appointment as Minister to Great Britain. Critics claimed Barbour sought a &quot;harbor in the storm&quot; from the upcoming election.

Nonetheless, European intellectuals accepted the new ambassador. 
During the 1820s, Barbour was a member of the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, as were other prominent military and medical professionals. On July 1, 1828, Barbour received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Oxford.

===Final years===
After President Adams&#x27; electoral defeat in 1828, Barbour returned to Virginia, announcing his candidacy for the General Assembly. However, Barbour&#x27;s association with Adams and nationalistic policies made him unfavorable to the Virginian Republicans. Although his opponent was illiterate, the election was extremely close. And although Barbour was declared the winner, the election was contested. Before the legal decision, Barbour retired on February 16, 1831, citing the hostility in the Assembly against him.

Barbour continued to remain active in national politics. In December 1831, he attended the first national convention of the National Republican Party in Baltimore and was elected its presiding officer. The convention nominated Henry Clay for president in 1832 and John Sergeant for vice president. Barbour also became chairman of the 1839 Whig Party convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which nominated Virginia-born William Henry Harrison for President (who won the election of 1840 to become the 9th President of the United States).

==Death and legacy==
After retiring from the Assembly, Barbour appeared and gave speeches to support political friends. One observer declared: &quot;Gov. Barbour presented an imposing appearance, with a striking face, long, shaggy eyebrows, and head covered with silvery flowing locks; with a majestic and sonorous voice, he filled one&#x27;s conception of a Roman Senator in the last days of the Republic.&quot; However, Barbour&#x27;s health declined, and he spent his final months at Barboursville. He died on June 7, 1842. Senator James Barbour was buried in the family cemetery on the estate.

The grave and ruin of his mansion, Barboursville, remain within the modern Barboursville Vineyards. The ruin is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as included within the Madison-Barbour Rural Historic District. However, the tombstone is a modern replacement ordered in 1940.

In addition to Barboursville, Virginia, Barboursville, West Virginia is named in his honor, as are Barbour County, West Virginia and Barbour County, Alabama. However, Barbourville, Kentucky is probably named after his uncle James Barbour (burgess)(1734–1804). The Library of Virginia has his executive papers.

The Barbour family remained politically powerful in that area of Virginia for the rest of the century, despite no longer enslaving people after the American Civil War. His first cousin John S. Barbour (1790–1855) also served in the Virginia General Assembly and chaired the Democratic National Convention of 1852. J.S. Barbour&#x27;s sons James Barbour and his elder brother John S. Barbour, Jr. served in the Virginia House of Delegates before the American Civil War, and James Barbour also served in the 1850 Virginia Constitutional Convention and the 1861 Secession Convention and in the Confederate States Army while his brother continued to run the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. After the war, John S. Barbour Jr. reorganized the state&#x27;s Conservative Party as the Democratic Party and served in both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.

<text>Rising Stars of Manga (RSoM) was an English-language comic anthology published by TOKYOPOP from 2002 to 2008, and a contest held by the same company. It was originally semi-annual, but switched to annual beginning with the 6th volume.

Each volume represented the results of a contest, in which aspiring comic book artists from all over the U.S. each submit a 15-20 page one-shot comic. Tokyopop staff select the best entry in each genre category (Comedy, Action, Mystery, Romance, Drama, Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Horror) to publish in the anthology. Each winner received a $1000 prize. In addition, a People&#x27;s Choice winner was decided from around 20 entries by votes from online viewers or users of the Toykopop website. The People&#x27;s Choice winner was awarded $500 and published in the anthology as well (although a genre winner could also be selected as a People&#x27;s Choice winner). Before the seventh RSoM competition (in 2007), the staff of TOKYOPOP picked one grand-prize winner, a Second and a Third prize winner, and eight runners-up with no distinctions in genre.

The youngest entrant to become a finalist was 15 and the youngest to be published in the anthology was also 15, and the oldest had been 39. Finalists were offered a chance to submit a proposal to create a series of books, usually lasting three volumes. Other finalists have parlayed the exposure provided by the contest into manga/comics jobs at other companies.

A few of the winners had the beginning chapters of their comics serialized by syndication in the Sunday comics of various American newspapers (&quot;Peach Fuzz&quot;, &quot;Van Von Hunter&quot; and &quot;Mail Order Ninja&quot;), through the Universal Press Syndicate.

==History==
Tokyopop launched its first Rising Stars of Manga contest on August 15, 2002 and ended it on December 16, 2002, with more than five hundred American artists submitting their 15–25 page, English-language stories. Priscilla Hamby and Clint Bickham&#x27;s &quot;Devil Candy&quot; won the grand prize while &quot;Van Von Hunter: Circlet of Necromancy&quot; by Michael Schwark and Ron R. Kaulfersch took first place. The second ran from June 1, to September 1, 2003; editors selected Lindsay Cibos&#x27;s &quot;Peach Fuzz&quot;—later adapted into a three-volume manga of the same name—as the grand-prize winner and Nicholas Liaw&#x27;s &quot;Unmasked&quot; as the first-place winner. The third ran from January 1, to March 15, 2004. &quot;Atomic King Daidogan&quot; by Nathan Maurer was chosen as the grand-prize winner and later expanded into a series. The fourth started on June 1, 2004, and concluded on August 16, 2004.

Tokyopop also created a Rising Stars of Manga contest for the United Kingdom; the first began on May 1, 2005.

<text>The Ford Futura is a large car that was made by Ford Australia between 1962 and 2008. Although the last Futura was part of the BF Series Ford Falcon range it was badged and marketed as the &#x27;Ford Futura&#x27; rather than the &#x27;Ford Falcon Futura&#x27;. Ford Australia first used the Futura name on the Ford Falcon Futura which was introduced in 1962 as the new luxury sedan in the Falcon XL Series range. The name was dropped from the XR Falcon range of 1966 and reintroduced in the XW range of 1969. It was discontinued again for the XC Series of 1976 and reappeared in the ED range of 1993. The name was used continuously by Ford Australia from that time until the replacement of the BF Series Ford Futura by the FG Series Ford G6 in 2008.

==US market==
Ford Futura was scheduled to denote a new sedan entry for the North American market in 2005 (the 2006 model year), the car it was destined for was renamed Ford Fusion while still under development, due to a trademark dispute. &quot;Futura&quot; proved to be owned by the Pep Boys auto parts chain, due to a tire line marketed by them under that brand. Ford&#x27;s claim failed because the company had not used the name for more than three years.

The company did use the name sporadically for several decades. In the 1950s, the 1955 Lincoln Futura show car was produced; it was modified in 1966, used as the basis for the Batmobile in the Batman television series. In the early 1960s, the Ford Falcon had a specialty coupe submodel called Futura, and the same was true of the Ford Fairmont in the late 1970s.

==Dutch market==
In the 2000s, Ford in the Netherlands sold Futura special editions of many of its mainstream models.

<text>The Combat Organization (, or the Fighting Organization) was the terrorist branch within the Socialist Revolutionary Party of Russia. It was a terror sub-group that was given autonomy under that Party. In his memoirs, group member Boris Savinkov called the group the &quot;Terrorist Brigade.&quot; (This phrasing was followed in his own memoirs by Whittaker Chambers, an American spy for the Soviets.)

==History==
In 1902, Grigory Gershuni founded and led the group. In July 1904 they murdered the Russian Minister of the Interior, Vyacheslav von Plehve.

In 1904, Gershuni was arrested, and Yevno Azef succeeded him, with Boris Savinkov as his deputy. Azef, a double-agent in the employ of the Tsarist secret police Okhrana, changed the Terrorist Brigade&#x27;s mode of attack from firearms to dynamite.
In its middle period (1903–1906) the brigade&#x27;s members included more than a dozen women and more than four dozen men—some nobles, honorary citizens, priests, and merchants. Most were 20–30 years old; 19 were Jews, and two Poles.
In 1908, Savinkov succeeded Azef, but the group disbanded shortly thereafter.

==Members==
* Grigory Gershuni
* Yevno Azef (also &quot;Evno&quot; and &quot;Azev&quot;/&quot;Azeff&quot; and &quot;Yevno Asiev&quot;)

<text>Ministry or department (also less commonly used secretariat, office, or directorate) are designations used by first-level executive bodies in the machinery of governments that manage a specific sector of public administration. 

These types of organizations are usually led by a politician who is a member of a cabinet—a body of high-ranking government officials—who may use a title such as minister, secretary, or commissioner, and are typically staffed with members of a non-political civil service, who manage its operations; they may also oversee other government agencies and organizations as part of a political portfolio. Governments may have differing numbers and types of ministries and departments. In some countries, these terms may be used with specific meanings: for example, an office may be a subdivision of a department or ministry.

==Usage==
===Canada===

The federal Government of Canada uses the term &quot;department&quot; to refer to its first-level executive bodies.

==== Subdivisions ====
In Canada, first-level subdivisions are known as provinces and territories. Five of the ten provincial governments use the term &quot;ministry&quot; to describe their departments (Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Alberta) but the other five, as well as the three territorial governments, use the term &quot;department&quot;. Despite the difference in nomenclature, both the provincial and federal governments use the term &quot;minister&quot; to describe the head of a ministry or department. The specific task assigned to a minister is referred to as his or her &quot;portfolio&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, all government organisations that consist of civil servants, and which may or may not be headed by a government minister or secretary of state, are considered to be departments. Until 2018, the term &quot;ministry&quot; had been retained only for the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Justice. On 8 January 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the Department of Communities and Local Government would be renamed to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to emphasise her government&#x27;s prioritising of housing policy. In September 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson reverted the ministry to a department, renaming it the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and giving it the responsibility of overseeing his government&#x27;s levelling up policy. It was then subsequently reverted to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government under the Starmer government in 2024.

===Other countries===
Some countries, such as Switzerland, the Philippines and the United States, do not use or no longer use the term &quot;ministry&quot; and instead call their main government bodies &quot;departments&quot;. However, in other countries such as Luxembourg a department is a subdivision of a ministry, usually led by a government member called a secretary of state who is subordinate to the minister. 

In Australia at the federal level, and also at the state level, the term &quot;ministry&quot; refers to the ministerial office held by a member of Cabinet, the executive, which is then responsible for one or more &quot;departments&quot;, the top division of the public service. The collection of departments responsible to a ministerial office and hence the minister, is referred to as the minister&#x27;s &quot;portfolio&quot;.

New Zealand&#x27;s state agencies include many ministries and a smaller number of departments. Increasingly, state agencies are styled neither as ministries nor as departments. All New Zealand agencies are under the direction of one or more ministers or associate ministers, whether they are styled &quot;ministries&quot; or not. Each body also has an apolitical chief executive, and in ministries and departments these chief executives often have the title of Secretary.

In Indonesia, the term &quot;ministry&quot; () is used. From the New Order to 2009, the office was known as &quot;department&quot; ().

In Malaysia, the term &quot;ministry&quot; is used for all but one government cabinet portfolio. The Prime Minister Department is the only portfolio that uses &quot;department&quot; instead. All government portfolios in the Peninsular Malaysia states use &quot;committee&quot;, while Sabah and Sarawak state governments following the federal government&#x27;s style in naming certain portfolios.

In Hong Kong, the term &quot;bureau&quot; is used, and departments are subordinate to the bureaus. 

In Mexico, ministries are referred to as &quot;secretariats&quot;. 

In 1999, the ministries of the federal government of Belgium became known as &quot;federal public service&quot;, the exception being the Ministry of Defense which kept the original designation.

In the Republic of China, &quot;ministry&quot; is used.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, &quot;ministry&quot; is used.

In Portugal, the organization adopted by the XXI (2015–2019) and the XXII (2019-2024) governments ceased to expressly foresee the existence of ministries, with the portfolios of the ministers being instead referred as &quot;government areas&quot; and having, in theory, a more flexible organization. Although the term &quot;ministry&quot; has been eliminated from the Government communication and from most of the new published laws, it continues to be used in some legislation, especially those referring to some government areas that existed for a long time as ministries (Finance, National Defense, Foreign Affairs, Health, etc.). The term &quot;ministry&quot; also continues to be used as the vernacular to refer to a government area.

In Nigeria each ministry is led by a minister who is not a member of the Nigerian legislature (due to the separation of powers) and is responsible to the popularly elected president.

In Lebanon, there are 21 ministries. Each ministry is led by a minister, and the prime minister is the 23rd minister of the Lebanese government.

In the European Union, the equivalent organisation to a national government department is termed &quot;directorate-general&quot; with the civil servant in charge called a director-general (in the European Commission, the political head of the department is one of the European Commissioners). 

The government departments of the Soviet Union were termed &quot;people&#x27;s commissariats&quot; between 1917 and 1946. &quot;Ministry&quot; was used, thereafter.

==In popular culture==
The term &quot;ministry&quot; has also been widely used in fiction, notably in satires and parodies.

===Books and films===
Portrayals of various fictional government ministries include:
* The Ministry of Magic is the governing body of the wizarding world of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the Harry Potter series (not a department of the British Government responsible for magical affairs). It is led by a Minister for Magic.
* In the novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; there are four Ministries in charge of Oceania: the Ministry of Truth (education, culture and propaganda), the Ministry of Love (the interior, security and policing), the Ministry of Plenty (economic affairs) and the Ministry of Peace (war and foreign affairs).
* The Ministry of Information Retrieval features in the film &quot;Brazil&quot;.
* The Ministry of Social Coherence appears in an Estonian comedy series &quot;Riigimehed&quot; (Statesmen).

===Television===
* In &quot;Yes Minister&quot; the Department of Administrative Affairs (DAA) is responsible for the administration of other government departments and the British Civil Service. This ministry had a number of other responsibilities, including National Health Service administration, local government, organising state visits by foreign leaders, enforcing European regulations, the arts and telecommunications.
*&quot;The Thick of It&quot; is set at the fictional Department of Social Affairs, later called the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, or &quot;DoSAC&quot; for short.
* The Ministry of Silly Walks is the subject of a sketch in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.
* The Spanish television show &quot;El ministerio del tiempo&quot; follows the exploits of an investigative team in the fictional Ministry of Time, which deals with incidents caused by time travel that can cause changes to the present day

<text>In constitutional usage in Commonwealth realms, a ministry (usually preceded by the definite article, i.e., the ministry) is a collective body of government ministers led by a head of government, such as a prime minister. It is described by Oxford Dictionaries as &quot;a period of government under one prime minister&quot;. Although the term &quot;cabinet&quot; can in some circumstances be a synonym, a ministry can be a broader concept which might include office-holders who do not participate in cabinet meetings. Other titles can include &quot;administration&quot; (in the United States) or &quot;government&quot; (in common usage among most parliamentary systems) to describe similar collectives.

The term is primarily used to describe the successive governments of the United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which share a common political heritage. In Australia, a new ministry begins after each election, regardless of whether the prime minister is re-elected, and whether there may have been a minor rearrangement of the ministry. In the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, a new ministry is formed only when there is a change of prime minister.

<text>Vicki Lawrence (born March 26, 1949), sometimes credited as Vicki Lawrence Schultz, is an American actress, comedian, and singer. She is best known for her character Mama (Thelma Harper). Lawrence also originated many other characters on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; from 1967 to 1978, the variety show&#x27;s entire series run.

The success of &quot;The Family&quot; skits eventually spun off into Lawrence&#x27;s own television sitcom, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, her character becoming the focal point and Mama&#x27;s traits expanding and evolving dramatically. Continuing Mama&#x27;s evolution, Lawrence has hosted an untelevised stand-up comedy routine since 2001, &quot;Vicki and Mama: A Two Woman Show.&quot; Moreover, Lawrence has made numerous post-&quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; guest TV show appearances in her famed Mama role.

In 1973, Lawrence became a one-hit wonder singer in the USA only, landing on the U.S. chart with &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia&quot;. It reached number one on both the United States and Canada charts. In addition to &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia&quot; In early 1974, she hit #1 in Australia with &quot;He Did with Me&quot;, followed up by the #7, &quot;Ships in the Night&quot;. She also released an album on Bell Records. Lawrence has multiple Emmy Award nominations, winning one in 1976. She is also a multiple Golden Globe nominee, all for &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. She also made several guest appearances in the Disney Channel sitcom &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; and starred in the Fox sitcom series &quot;The Cool Kids&quot;.

== Early life ==
Lawrence was born Vicki Ann Axelrad in Inglewood, California. 

Her paternal grandfather, Simon Axelrad, an Austrian Jewish immigrant. Her paternal grandmother, Anna Irmas, was born in Illinois, to German Jewish parents but became an adherent of Christian Science, in which faith Vicki&#x27;s father was raised. The family surname was legally changed to &quot;Lawrence&quot; when Vicki was young. 

A graduate of Morningside High School in Inglewood (class of 1967), Lawrence had originally planned on being a dental hygienist. She attended UCLA while on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, and changed her major to theater arts, but dropped out after two years.

In high school, she auditioned for and got into the musical group The Young Americans. She stayed with the group almost until the end of high school. By being with the group, she gained experience from touring, performing at the Oscars, coming in contact with noteworthy performers such as Johnny Mathis and Louis Armstrong, and performing on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;.

In her senior year, she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighter&#x27;s ball. A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore a striking resemblance to a young Carol Burnett. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrence&#x27;s mother urged her to write a letter, which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article. After receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrence&#x27;s father&#x27;s name in the phone book, called him, and said she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and Burnett was called to the stage to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress to play her younger sister on her upcoming show. After a few months and auditions, Lawrence, aged 18, got the part, specifically to play &quot;Chrissy&quot; in the &quot;Carol and Sis&quot; sketches.

After Lawrence was given the job on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, both Burnett and Harvey Korman took her under their wings. Korman taught her various sketch comedy skills, such as listening not just for a cue line, and also coached her in other areas, such as speaking in different accents. Lawrence has credited Korman and Burnett with being her mentors, and has referred to her experience on the show as the &quot;Harvard school of comedy&quot;. Lawrence has stated that she learned show business from Burnett and looked up to her very much, and that the two share a very close friendship.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===
As a comedian and actress, Lawrence is best known for her work on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.

==== Mama Character and Mama&#x27;s Family ====

In &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;″s seventh season, Lawrence debuted her famed Mama role on a comedy sketch called &quot;The Family&quot;. Only created as a one-off skit, &quot;The Family&quot;″s unexpected success with audiences led to it having recurring installments for the final five seasons of the program. With Lawrence portraying the character of a cold, unaffectionate, widowed, elderly mother to the neurotic, misfortunate Eunice (played by Burnett despite Lawrence being 16 years younger), &quot;The Family&quot; bred some of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;″s most famed blooper moments.

Her portrayal of the Mama character on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The Family&quot; sketches was so popular that CBS developed the TV movie &quot;Eunice&quot; in 1982, and &quot;NBC&quot; subsequently created the sitcom &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, elaborating on the Mama character (Burnett reprised the Eunice Higgins character for the sitcom from time to time). The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for &quot;Vicki Lawrence &amp; Mama: A Two-Woman Show&quot;.

==== Other acting ====

Lawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Major Dad&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;. She appeared in two episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, playing different characters. Lawrence also played Dan&#x27;s old high-school flame, Phyllis, in an episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot;.

Between the NBC and syndication runs of &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot &quot;Anything for Love&quot;, which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred Lauren Tewes and Rebeca Arthur. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and Tim Conway in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on &quot;Nunsense Jamboree&quot; that originally aired on TNN in 1998. She is also known for her voice-over work as Flo on the animated series &quot;Hermie and Friends&quot;.

Lawrence played Mamaw Stewart (the mother of Robby Ray Stewart and grandmother of Jackson and Miley Stewart) in the hit Disney series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; alongside Billy Ray Cyrus and his daughter Miley Cyrus from 2006 to 2011. In 2011, she was Mrs. Santa Claus in the Hallmark movie &quot;Annie Claus Is Coming to Town.&quot; She starred in the Fox sitcom &quot;The Cool Kids&quot;, along with Martin Mull, Leslie Jordan, and David Alan Grier from 2018 to 2019.

Lawrence played as Mama in an Ohio commercial, promoting a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in Ohio. She also appeared in a special celebrity-edition episode of the Anne Robinson version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. Playing for a charity, she made it to the final two but ended up losing to Ed Begley Jr.

=== Music ===
As a singer, Lawrence got her start as one of the scores of hopefuls on the syndicated &quot;Johnny Mann&#x27;s Stand Up And Cheer&quot; program. However, she is most known for her number-one hit, &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia&quot;, a song written by her first husband Bobby Russell, which was released on Bell Records in November 1972. It sold over two million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America during the last episode of the sixth season of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (March 24, 1973), when Burnett herself surprised Lawrence with the award on the air. Her first LP, &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia&quot;, was issued soon after the single went gold. The song was re-recorded by Reba McEntire for her 1991 album &quot;For My Broken Heart&quot;. McEntire released the track as a single to country radio in 1992 and it peaked at No. 12 on the country chart, aided in part by a highly cinematic music video.

&quot;He Did With Me&quot;, Lawrence&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia&quot;, reached number 75 in the United States, although it reached the top 20 of the adult contemporary music charts and also became her biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number one there in November 1973. She followed it up there with &quot;Ships in the Night&quot; (1974). In the fall of 1975, Lawrence managed one last minor U.S. chart entry on the Private Stock label with &quot;The Other Woman&quot; (number 81).

In 1974, she recorded her second LP for Bell Records, &quot;Ships in the Night&quot;. The label was in the process of being phased out by Arista, and the LP was not released in the U.S. The LP was, however, released in Australia, where she continued to have chart success. Lawrence&#x27;s first two LPs were released as a single CD with bonus tracks on April 1, 2014, by Real Gone Music.

She released a disco album entitled &quot;Newborn Woman&quot; in late 1979. The album produced the minor disco hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;.

=== Hosting and other work ===
As an emcee, Lawrence hosted the daytime NBC version of the game show &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; (1987-1990), as well as an unsold pilot for Mark Goodson Productions, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Body Talk&quot;. She has also appeared often as a popular celebrity player on such game shows as &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Password Plus&quot;, &quot;Super Password&quot;, and various incarnations of the &quot;Pyramid&quot; game show, where she was known for verbally sparring with host Dick Clark on numerous occasions. In one episode, she also left after losing only to return during the closing credits. She also appeared on the 1986–89 version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, where she appeared both as herself and in character as Thelma &quot;Mama&quot; Harper. She was a regular panelist on the 1998 revival of Match Game, but the series only lasted one season.

As a talk show host, Lawrence was nominated a number of times for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host for the eponymous &quot;Vicki!&quot; (1992–1994), but the show ended after two seasons amid creative battles with her syndicator. In 1997, she hosted &quot;Fox After Breakfast,&quot; which was renamed &quot;The Vicki Lawrence Show&quot;, but was cancelled five weeks later due to low ratings.

In 2018, Lawrence was seen promoting &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and other classic television series on the MeTV television network.

She currently tours the country with her &quot;two-woman&quot; show with the first half as herself and the second half done as Mama. She can also be seen on TV in an infomercial for the Big Boss Grill.

== Personal life ==
Lawrence was married to singer and songwriter Bobby Russell from 1972 to 1974. Lawrence&#x27;s second husband was Hollywood make-up artist Al Schultz, whom she married November 16, 1974, and with whom she had two children, Courtney Allison Schultz (born May 3, 1975) and Garrett Lawrence Schultz (born July 3, 1977). Al Schultz died June 19, 2024.

Lawrence was a registered Republican for most of her life, and a strong supporter of Elizabeth Dole. In 2000, she changed her affiliation to the Democratic Party and endorsed Al Gore. Since then, she has remained active in a variety of liberal leaning causes including women&#x27;s rights, animal welfare and the environment.

Lawrence and her family appeared on &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; in July 2015.

Lawrence was diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) around 2011. She teamed with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and has become the spokesperson for the campaign &quot;CIU &amp; You&quot;.

She appeared on &quot;The Doctors&quot; in 2015 to relay her story and talk about CIU and promote the CIU &amp; You campaign.

<text>Bernard Kipchirchir Lagat (born December 12, 1974) is a Kenyan-American former middle and long-distance runner.

Lagat was born in Kapsabet, Kenya. Prior to his change of domicile to the US, Lagat had an extensive competitive career representing his native country.

With his personal best of 3:26.34, Lagat is the Kenyan record holder at 1500 m outdoors, and is the second fastest 1500 m runner of all time, behind Hicham El Guerrouj. After becoming an American citizen, he broke American records in several events, including the 1500 m, mile, 3000 m, and 5000 m.

Lagat is a five-time Olympian, having competed in the 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 games, and is a thirteen-time medalist in World Championships and Olympics including five gold medals. At the age of 41, he finished 5th in the finals of the 5000 m at the Rio Olympics.

Lagat&#x27;s long-term coach is James Li of the University of Arizona, with whom he has worked for over a decade. Today, Lagat is the head cross country coach and an assistant track and field coach at the University of Arizona.

== Early life ==
Lagat was born in Kaptel village, near Kapsabet town in Nandi District of Kenya. He is a Nandi, a sub-tribe of the Kalenjin people.

He graduated from the Kaptel High School in 1994, where he had started his athletic career. He joined Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Nairobi 1996. Later in the same year he moved to Washington State University where other Kenyan athletic greats such as Henry Rono and Michael Kosgei prospered.

In 1998, while at WSU, Lagat won three NCAA individual championships; indoor mile and 3000 m, as well as the 5000 m outdoors.

In 2000, Lagat graduated from Washington State University with a degree in management information systems.

Lagat&#x27;s siblings have also competed in athletics; his older sister Mary Chepkemboi won the 3000 m at the 1984 African Championships in Athletics, his younger sister Viola Cheptoo placed second in the 2021 New York City Marathon

== Representing Kenya (2000–2004) ==
Lagat first represented his native Kenya at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. In the 1500 m final, Morocco used team tactics to try to ensure a gold medal for heavy favorite Hicham El Guerrouj. In a very close finish, Noah Ngeny took gold, El Guerrouj won silver, and Lagat captured bronze. Lagat finished the year being ranked #3 in the world at 1500 m.

The next summer, Lagat won the silver medal, behind El Guerrouj, at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, and later that summer, at a meet in Brussels, Lagat set the Kenyan National Record and became the second fastest individual ever at 1500 m when he ran 3:26.34, finishing second in this race behind Hicham El Guerrouj (3:26.13), in an attempt to break El Guerrouj&#x27;s world record of 3:26.00. Lagat finished the year ranked #2 in the world at 1500 m.

Lagat spent most of 2002 and 2003 chasing El Guerrouj. At the 2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships, he earned the silver medal at 1500 m, this time behind Driss Maazouzi of France. Lagat withdrew from the 2003 world outdoor championships after a blood test showed traces of EPO in his system. His B sample test came back negative, clearing him of any charges. He was ranked 2nd and 4th in the world at 1500 m in 2002 and 2003 respectively.

In the 3000 m at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships Lagat won his first international gold medal. Lagat was clearly overjoyed at his comeback since 2003. Throughout the spring he competed fiercely and beat his rival El Guerrouj in Zürich with a world leading time at 1500 m of 3:27.40. At the 2004 Summer Olympics Lagat seemed poised to once again defeat El Guerrouj. The final saw Lagat and El Guerrouj battling down the final 100 m, swapping the lead multiple times. El Guerrouj prevailed, with Lagat close behind, earning the silver medal, running the final lap in under 52 seconds. He was, however, ranked #1 in the world at 1500 m for the year.

== Representing the United States (2005–present) ==

=== Beginning of American career ===
In March 2005, Lagat announced that he had become a naturalized citizen of the United States on May 7, 2004. Lagat did compete for his homeland Kenya in the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning silver in the 1500 m. Even though Kenya did not allow dual citizenship at the time, he was allowed to keep his medal. Lagat became a competitor for the United States but was temporarily banned from international championship events, missing the IAAF World Championships in Helsinki.

The U.S. does allow dual citizenship and consequently races run by Lagat after May 7, 2004, could have been ratified as American records, since USATF rules only state that an athlete has to be a U.S. citizen competing in a sanctioned competition to be eligible to set a national record. His 3:27.40 win in the 1500 meters, on August 6, 2004, in Zürich, was ratified as an American record in 2018, but not an area record by the NACAC.

Nevertheless, Lagat owns three American records from races he had run in 2005 that were ratified by USATF. His first American records came indoors, with a 3:49.89 mile at Fayetteville, Arkansas, on February 11, 2005, during which his 1500 meters split time of 3:33.34 also established another new U.S. record, en route to a win in the event. The performance replaced records by Steve Scott, who set the previous American indoor mile record of 3:51.8 in 1981, and the previous American 1500 meter indoor record held by Jeff Atkinson, who ran 3:38.12 in 1989. Lagat&#x27;s winning time of 3:29.40 at Rieti, Italy, on August 28, 2005, in the outdoor 1500 meters was ratified as his third new American record, improving upon the old record of 3:29.77, set by Sydney Maree in 1985.

=== Double world champion ===
At the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Lagat surpassed all his previous achievements by becoming the first athlete to become world champion in both the 1,500 m and 5,000 m at the same IAAF World Outdoor Championships. Similar feats were accomplished by Hicham El Guerrouj at the 2004 Olympics and Paavo Nurmi at the 1924 Olympics.

=== 2008 Olympics and 2009 Worlds ===

In 2008, Lagat won both 1500 m and 5000 m runs at the US Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, qualifying himself to compete with Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Hopes were high that his success in both these events would continue at the Olympics. However, Lagat failed to advance beyond the semi-finals in the 1500 m run. He was more successful in the 5000 m run, winning his semi-final heat to advance, but ultimately did not medal, running to ninth-place finish in the finals.

Lagat had concealed the fact that he was running with an injured Achilles tendon, a problem which hampered his training and contributed to his poor showing at the Olympics. He stated that his placings at the 2008 Beijing Games were &quot;the biggest disappointment in my athletics career&quot;. The following season, he began with high altitude training in Flagstaff, Arizona. After tying Eamonn Coghlan&#x27;s record of seven wins in the Wanamaker Mile at the 2009 Millrose Games in New York, Lagat broke Coghlan&#x27;s record with an 8th win at Millrose in 2010. As the reigning world champion in the 1500 and 5000 meters, he automatically received qualification in the events at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics and set his sights on retaining his titles. Despite being much older than some of his competitors, Lagat&#x27;s desire to win had not faded and he said &quot;I am more motivated than ever to go to the podium in Berlin&quot;. Lagat ultimately won the bronze medal in the 1500 m and the silver medal in the 5000 m.

=== 2010 to present ===
Lagat set a new American record in his debut of the indoor 5000 meters at the Reebok Boston Indoor Games on February 6, 2010, with a time of 13:11.50. This beat previous record holder Galen Rupp who had set the record at 13:18.12 in 2009. On June 4, 2010, Lagat broke the American Record for 5000 m with 12:54.12 on June 4, 2010, at the Bislett Games in Oslo. Lagat set another area record at the Rieti IAAF Grand Prix in August: chasing down Tariku Bekele in the 3000 m. Lagat took second place with an American record of 7:29.00 – his first sub-7:30 minute time.

Lagat broke his own 5000 m American record in July at the Monaco Diamond League meet by running 12:53.60 to finish a close second behind Mo Farah who set the British 5000 m record in this race in a time of 12:53.11. The 2011 World Championships in Athletics, the 5000 m final came down to a sprint finish and Lagat was beaten in the last straight by Mo Farah, leaving Lagat with his second consecutive silver medal at the world event.
The 2012 Millrose Games, was held for the first time at the Armory Track &amp; Field Center and Lagat ran an American indoor record over 5000 m with a time of 13:07.15 minutes. At the 2012 Olympics in London, Lagat finished fourth in the 5000 m race, crossing the line 1.33 seconds behind the leader, Mo Farah, after being tripped up when he was going into his kick by Isiah Kiplangat Koech. Lagat was runner-up behind Matthew Centrowitz Jr. at the Fifth Avenue Mile that year.

Lagat earned his 4th USATF Indoor 3000 meters title on February 22, 2014 On June 27, Lagat, at age 39, won his seventh USA men&#x27;s 5,000 title.

He made his debut at the 10,000 m on 1 May 2016 and came in first. His winning time of 27:49 seconds made an improvement for the world record in the Masters A40 category by 51 seconds.
On July 9, Lagat won the 5000 meters at the 2016 United States Olympic Trials, qualifying him for his fifth Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. He entered the last lap in sixth place more than two and a half seconds behind race leader Galen Rupp. At age 41, his final lap was 52.82, the fastest of the field and more than a second faster than any in the 1500 meter final. Joining Lagat on the team were Somali born Hassan Mead and Kenyan born Paul Chelimo, making for an entirely foreign born delegation. Lagat also became the oldest runner at the Summer Olympics to represent the United States. On August 20, 2016, Lagat initially claimed the 6th-place finish in the 5000 meters at the Olympics. He was moved to bronze after three runners were disqualified, but was moved back to 5th after 2 of the 3 were reinstated. He outsprinted Andrew Butchart of Great Britain, who is 17 years his junior, by more than a second.

Lagat ran his final race as a professional on September 3, 2016, at the ISTAF meet in Berlin where he came in second place in the 3,000 meters.

In May 2017 Lagat served as a pacer for Nike&#x27;s Breaking2 attempt at achieving a sub-2-hour marathon time. Lagat also agreed to run as a pacer at a similar event, the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, in October 2019.

On September 10, 2017, Lagat finished eighth in the 2017 Great North Run half marathon in 1:03:02.

Lagat participated on his first marathon in New York City Marathon on 4 Nov, 2018 finishing 18th with a time of 2:17:20. He had a lead to the second-placed finisher in his age group of 11:15 minutes.

On 29 February 2020, Lagat placed 18th with a time of 2:14:23 in the Atlanta Olympic Trials Marathon. In preparation he had a 30 km training run with the world record holder Eliud Kipchoge in Kenya.

Lagat lives in Tucson, Arizona and Tübingen, Germany with his wife Gladys Tom (a Canadian of Chinese descent), whom he met while they both attended Washington State University, and their son Miika Kimutai (born in 2006) and daughter Gianna (born 2008). In 2023, Lagat was named by Carnegie Corporation of New York as an honoree of the Great Immigrants Awards. Lagat is Catholic.

<doc id="859435" wikidata="Q7146412" url="?curid=859435" title="Patrick Duffy (British politician)">
<text>Sir Albert Edward Patrick Duffy KCSG (born 17 June 1920) is a British economist and Labour Party politician. He was the member of parliament for Colne Valley from 1963 to 1966, and for Sheffield Attercliffe from 1970 to 1992. Duffy was also a Minister of the Navy in the 1970s, and president of the NATO Assembly in the 1980s. Following the death of Ronald Atkins on 30 December 2020, Duffy became Britain&#x27;s oldest surviving former MP.

==Early life and career==
Duffy was born in Wigan, Lancashire on 17 June 1920, to Irish Catholic immigrant parents James and Margaret Duffy, who were both from the village of Raith, near Aghamore in County Mayo. James and his father, who was also named Patrick, moved to England as migrant agricultural workers in the late 19th and early 20th century. James worked as a miner in Wigan&#x27;s Maypole pit, before moving with his family to the mining village of Rossington near Doncaster in South Yorkshire in 1925. , the younger Patrick still lives in Doncaster.

Duffy served in the Fleet Air Arm in World War II. After his plane crashed near Scapa Flow in Orkney, Duffy, still in his early 20s, was given the last rites by a priest; however, despite being registered as 100% disabled, he was successfully treated by the pioneering surgion Harold Gillies and left the forces in 1946 with the rank of Commanding Officer at the Naval School of Air Radar.

Duffy&#x27;s interest in politics was stirred whilst he was a student at the London School of Economics; it was there and at Columbia University in New York where he obtained his degree and Doctorate of Law. Following this, he took up a professorship at Leeds University. He lectured there from 1950 to 1963, and from 1967 to 1970, with a break for his initial stint in Parliament. During this period, he was also a visiting professor at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey. Later in his career, he was a visiting professor at the American Graduate School of International Business, from 1982 to 1993, and at Wheaton&#x27;s International Business Institute in Illinois, from 1992.

==Political career==
Duffy first contested the Parliamentary seat of Tiverton in 1950, when he was completing his studies at the LSE, before he took students – including his future Labour colleague Shirley Catlin, who went on to become Baroness Williams – to Columbia University in New York. Despite Tiverton being a safe seat for the Conservative Party, Duffy contested it twice more, in 1951 and 1955, before moving to the more promising seat of Colne Valley, which he won at a by-election in 1963. He held Colne Valley until the 1966 general election, when he was defeated by the Liberal Richard Wainwright, despite the national swing to Labour.

Duffy was selected to stand for Sheffield Attercliffe (which had been a safe seat for the Labour Party) at the 1970 general election following a close selection contest with George Caborn, father of future Sheffield MP Richard Caborn. He was consequently elected to represent the constituency in the House of Commons at that general election; Duffy held onto the seat with five-figure majorities at each of the subsequent contests he fought there.

Duffy was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Defence from 1974 to 1976, and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Royal Navy) MoD in Jim Callaghan&#x27;s Government from 1976 to 1979. Following Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 1979 general election, Duffy was Opposition Spokesman on Defence from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1984.

Duffy was a &quot;moderate&quot; on the right of the Labour Party, being a staunch pro-European and opponent of unilateral nuclear disarmament. He voted for John Silkin in the 1980 leadership election, rather than Michael Foot, the successful candidate from the party&#x27;s soft left. During this period, there was an attempt to deselect Duffy, which failed by just five votes. Politically, he has said that he was close to Callaghan, Roy Hattersley, John Smith, and the young Gordon Brown. Despite his earlier pro-European views, Duffy supported the 2016 vote in favour of Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union, commenting, &quot;Lifelong Labour supporters, like me, wanted Brexit. Reluctantly and regretfully for me, and I was a Common Marketeer in the 1970s, the creation of the Eurozone made the European Union no longer a practical venture.&quot;

Following the death in May 1981 of IRA&#x27;s Bobby Sands, one of the Irish hunger strikers who starved himself to death in prison, Duffy was the sole member of the British House of Commons to condemn Margaret Thatcher, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In comments directed at Thatcher, amidst heckles from the Conservative benches (and frowns from his own side, whose official line was to support the Prime Minister&#x27;s stance), he remarked:

These comments caused outrage, but led to Duffy receiving 600 letters in support from around the world. Despite this, however, Thatcher later invited Duffy for tea when he was appointed President of the NATO Assembly and the two became friends. &quot;We got on so well that her officials were starting to get nervous that our meeting would never finish,&quot; he commented in 2020.

Duffy stood down from Parliament at the 1992 general election. In a 2020 interview with Catholic magazine &quot;The Tablet&quot;, Duffy was quoted (&quot;half in jest&quot;, according to the interviewer) on his career as an MP: &quot;I spent 19 and a half of my 25 years in opposition. If I&#x27;d known that was how it was going to be at the beginning, I&#x27;d never have gone in for it&quot;. , he remains president of the Labour Life Group, in keeping with his pro-life views on abortion. He had hoped to go to the House of Lords upon his retirement, but, according to &quot;The Tablet&quot;, the then-Leader of the Labour Party Neil Kinnock was &quot;not a fan&quot; of his.

==Outside Parliament==
Duffy was president of the North Atlantic Assembly (the parliamentary arm of NATO) during the first-time delegations from the Warsaw Pact nations. In 1991, he served as leader of the first Western parliamentary delegation to the Kremlin, and that year, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, in recognition of his NATO role, becoming entitled to be known as Sir Patrick Duffy for his contribution to the Western Alliance. In 2014, he said &quot;After the Catholic Church and the International Post Office and the International Labour Organisation in Geneva, I don&#x27;t believe a more impressive international organisation has emerged other than Nato.&quot; He was president of the NATO Assembly at a time when the Cold War came to an end in the late 1980s and early 1990s; it was in this capacity that he also had a private audience with Pope John Paul II, on 9 October 1989. It was said that Duffy was a &quot;major force&quot; in bringing the Cold War to an end. In 1993, he was made an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by the Dominican University, Illinois.

Duffy also functioned as Deputy Chair of the Atlantic Council of the UK. As of 2017, he served as a member of the Advisory Boards of the Centre of Defence and International Security Studies at Hull University, and the Universities of Lancaster and York Defence Research Institute. He also served as an associate of the Centre for Defence and International Security Studies at Lancaster University, the International Business Institute and Azusa Pacific University, where he served as a guest lecturer during the autumn semester of 2007, and was keynote speaker for Azusa Pacific University&#x27;s Economic Summit.

Speaking in 2020, Duffy stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve never left Labour and I never will&quot;. Aged 100, he was said to be &quot;intrigued&quot; by &quot;the ongoing battle between [Prime Minister] Boris Johnson and [Labour Party leader] Keir Starmer&quot;, remarking of the latter that he was &quot;infinitely better than Jeremy Corbyn&quot;, Starmer&#x27;s predecessor as party leader. In 2024, when asked if he was still a Labour supporter, he replied: &quot;Oh yes! More than ever!&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2014, Duffy published his autobiography, &quot;Growing Up Irish in Britain, British in Ireland and in Washington, Moscow, Rome and Sydney&quot;. In 2024, he published a second volume, &quot;From Wigan to Westminster: Hot Wars, Cold Wars and the Carrier Strike Groups&quot;.

A practising Catholic, Duffy completed the El Camino Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage (known as the Way of St. James in English) for six years running whilst in his 80s, which involved him walking 25 km a day for 35 days. He was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (KCSG) at the age of 96 in 2017. He has never married, though according to &quot;Yorkshire Live&quot;, &quot;he says he was not short of attractive female company during his many years in office.&quot;

Duffy turned 100 on 17 June 2020, and celebrated his birthday at home in Doncaster; he also has a home in County Roscommon in Ireland, where he has spent much of his time. When asked for the secret to his longevity, he said &quot;I never smoked, I never used my ministerial car when I could walk – I never used any such transport when I could avoid doing so – and I read&quot;. In December 2020, following the death of his old Parliamentary Labour Party colleague Ronald Atkins, he became the oldest living former MP.

<doc id="859436" wikidata="Q176141" url="?curid=859436" title="Godfrey–Milliken Bill">
<text>The Godfrey–Milliken Bill, also called the American Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Loyalty) Act, was a private member&#x27;s bill introduced in the Canadian parliament by Liberal MPs Peter Milliken and John Godfrey. The bill was intended as a parody of the American Helms–Burton Act.

The Helms–Burton Act set up stringent punishments on any business or person that profited from property of American businesses and people that had been seized in the Cuban Revolution. The bill included a policy of punishing foreign nations and companies who had profited from this seized property (which in practice means trading with Cuba at all, since everything in Cuba is in some way connected to such property). This included a number of Canadian companies.

The 1996 bill responded by calling for descendants of United Empire Loyalists who fled the American Revolution to be able to reclaim land and property that was confiscated by the American government. The bill would have also allowed the Canadian government to exclude corporate officers, or controlling shareholders of companies that possess property formerly owned by Loyalists, as well as the spouse and minor child of such persons from entering Canada. In total some three million Canadians are descendants of United Empire Loyalists, including Milliken and Godfrey. The current value of the land and property seized during the American Revolution is many billions of dollars.

The bill received widespread attention in Canada and also some publicity in the United States, including a feature on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

The Godfrey–Milliken Bill did not become law. Milliken later supported Bill C-54 to amend the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act which effectively neutralized any attempt to enforce the Helms–Burton Act on Canadians or Canadian companies. The amendments blocked access to Canadian records for the prosecution of any case under the Helms–Burton Act, allowed the Attorney General to block Canadian courts from enforcing judgments emanating from US jurisdictions against Canadian defendants, permitted Canadian defendants to counter-sue in Canadian courts, and imposed a $1.5 million fine (equivalent to $ million in ) to any Canadian entity that aided any prosecution under Helms–Burton.

<text>Oranges &amp; Lemons is the 11th studio album and the second double album by the English band XTC, released 27 February 1989 on Virgin Records. It is the follow-up to 1986&#x27;s &quot;Skylarking&quot;. The title (derived from the nursery rhyme of the same name) was chosen in reference to the band&#x27;s poor financial standing at the time, while the music is characterised as a 1980s update of 1960s psychedelia. It received critical acclaim and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting album since 1982&#x27;s &quot;English Settlement&quot;, rising to number 28 in the UK and number 44 in the US.

The album is primarily pop and rock, although a variety of other styles are plundered throughout, such as jazz, reggae, hard rock, Middle Eastern music and Zairean soukous. 12 of the album&#x27;s 15 tracks were written by guitarist Andy Partridge, with the rest by bassist Colin Moulding. The work projected brighter, more upbeat and aggressive moods than &quot;Skylarking&quot;, and the harsher effect returned the group closer to the sound of their earlier records. Lyrically, most of the songs focus on parent-child relationships and the state of world affairs. Partridge&#x27;s ornate vision for the psychedelic opening track &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; exemplified the album&#x27;s general aesthetic, which he described as songs that could be singles in a &quot;bizarre perfect universe&quot;.

XTC recorded the album in Los Angeles with American producer Paul Fox (his first major production job) and Mr. Mister drummer Pat Mastelotto. Recording lasted from June to September 1988, during which Virgin threatened to drop the project numerous times due to its growing expenses. Total production costs were estimated to be £180,000 (about a quarter million in US dollars). The cover art was intended to resemble the work of Heinz Edelmann, the art director for the 1968 film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.

Lead single &quot;Mayor of Simpleton&quot;, a jangle pop song, reached number 46 on the UK Singles Chart and number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it their only US single to chart. It was followed with &quot;King for a Day&quot; (number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks) and &quot;The Loving&quot; (no chart showing). The group embarked on a brief acoustic-guitar American radio tour and made their first live performances in front of an audience since 1982. One performance for MTV inspired the network to invite more artists to perform stripped-down sets, calling the series &quot;unplugged&quot;. However, attempts to coax Partridge back into regular touring were unsuccessful.

==Background==
Since 1982&#x27;s &quot;English Settlement&quot;, XTC had withdrawn from concert touring. Studio experimentation and 1960s influences increasingly showed in their records, culminating in the 1985 mini-album &quot;25 O&#x27;Clock&quot;, which saw the band adopting retro-psychedelic personas as &quot;the Dukes of Stratosphear&quot;. The trend continued into XTC&#x27;s &quot;Skylarking&quot; (1986), becoming one of the best-selling records of their career. However, the group still &quot;languished in relative obscurity&quot; amid a growing cult following. Recording sessions for &quot;Skylarking&quot; were fraught with tension between Partridge and producer Todd Rundgren. Rundgren took issue with Partridge&#x27;s tendency to fill arrangements with as many ideas as possible, and in turn, Partridge resented that his suggestions were repeatedly undermined by Rundgren.

After &quot;Skylarking&quot;, Partridge suffered a brief writer&#x27;s block. He recalled &quot;getting really worried. I wrote a few things and I thought it was shit. Then suddenly loads of stuff started coming out, and it wasn&#x27;t shit.&quot; To appease requests from his bandmates and Virgin Records, he agreed to record one more Dukes album, &quot;Psonic Psunspot&quot; (1987). It consisted partly of XTC songs rejected for earlier albums. Both &quot;25 O&#x27;Clock&quot; and &quot;Psonic Psunspot&quot; outsold the latest XTC albums of the time (1984&#x27;s &quot;The Big Express&quot; in the former&#x27;s case). They then contributed a newly recorded song, &quot;Happy Families&quot;, to the John Hughes film &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot; (1988).

In early 1988, XTC began rehearsing material for their next LP. At the suggestion of A&amp;R executive Jeremy Lascelles, young American producer Paul Fox was recruited based on the strength of a Boy George remix that the label commissioned of him. Partridge disliked the original track but enjoyed Fox&#x27;s remix: &quot;It was really shiny, powerful and impressive.&quot; Fox subsequently flew to England and met Partridge at his home: &quot;He was obviously a huge fan of the band and was willing to translate what we wanted onto tape.&quot; He offered them a cheap studio rate in Los Angeles, which the band accepted. Another reason for recording in the US with an American producer, guitarist Dave Gregory said, was that the US had become &quot;our biggest market&quot;. XTC, accompanied by the Moulding and Partridge families, arrived in Los Angeles on 12 May and stayed at the Oakwood Apartments in north Hollywood. The families returned home after two months; Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding then shared an apartment for the remainder of their stay.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; is primarily a pop and rock album, although a variety of other styles are plundered throughout, such as jazz, reggae, hard rock, Middle Eastern music and Zairean soukous. It projected brighter, more upbeat and aggressive moods than XTC&#x27;s recent work, and the harsher effect positioned the group closer to the sound of their earlier records. The psychedelic ambiance of the Dukes records is retained, albeit with a lesser emphasis on &quot;loopy&quot; humour. In &quot;Stereogum&quot; writer Rob Ham&#x27;s description, the intention was to filter the Dukes aesthetic using contemporary instruments and technology; as a result, most of the album&#x27;s songs, and especially Partridge&#x27;s, are arranged in a maximalist fashion exemplified by the first song, &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;. Gary Ramon of &quot;Record Collector&quot; concurred that &quot;while a 60s edge was detectable, the sound was firmly rooted in the Eighties.&quot;

Before sessions began, Partridge envisioned the album as &quot;a very simple, banal-sounding record&quot; with more basic arrangements than the final product: &quot;it got lost in translation a little and came out rather multi-layered - in fact, very dense. We just got swept along with the enthusiasm.&quot; Journalist Nick Reed observed of the LP, &quot;Nearly every instrument is mixed to the forefront; it&#x27;s too well-arranged to be cacophonous, but there&#x27;s a degree of sensory overload, especially given the band&#x27;s newfound tendency to blast synthesizers in our faces.&quot; Many vocal counterpoints are heard throughout the record. Partridge likened it to &quot;several songs happening at once. It&#x27;s musical masturbation ... Not many people do that now - not since &quot;West Side Story&quot; or &quot;South Pacific&quot;&quot;.

23 songs were demoed for the LP, with the final 15 chosen by Paul Fox. All of the selections were written by Partridge, except three by Moulding (&quot;King for a Day&quot;, &quot;One of the Millions&quot;, and &quot;Cynical Days&quot;). Lyrically, several of the songs focus on parent-child relationships in addition to the state of world affairs. For Partridge, this was partly due to the fact that he had toddler-aged children. He attributed the influence of the Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; to Moulding&#x27;s songs for the record. Moulding himself said that he had been in a depression writing the songs for the record. XTC biographer Chris Twomey identified &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, &quot;Here Comes President Kill Again&quot;, and &quot;The Loving&quot; as examples where &quot;the Dukes were still alive in spirit&quot;, whereas &quot;King for a Day&quot;, &quot;Poor Skeleton Steps Out&quot;, &quot;Hold Me My Daddy&quot;, and &quot;Across This Antheap&quot; indicated &quot;completely fresh directions&quot;. Of these, &quot;King for a Day&quot; and &quot;The Loving&quot; were the album&#x27;s &quot;most overtly commercial songs&quot;. In the analysis of music writer Richard Walls:

Commenting on the influence of the Beatles, Partridge said, &quot;There is some Beatles in our music, but also some Captain Beefheart, some jazz bands, some others who were not necessarily musicians, like Miró, Walt Disney ... If people see only some Beatles, it is because they want to search only for some Fab Four.&quot; He acknowledged that it was their first work in which they were conscious that they had a record-buying audience, particularly in the US. External stresses affecting the group included their ongoing litigation against former manager Ian Reid. Colin Moulding remembered, &quot;it was about to come to a head, and that was the worrying thing ... If we hadn&#x27;t had a relatively successful record with &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; at that time, we would have been in deep shite&quot;.

==Production==
===Setting and atmosphere===
Given an initial budget of £150,000 (equivalent to £ in ), rehearsals began on 16 May with Pat Mastelotto of Mr. Mister joining the group as session drummer. The band later recalled the rehearsals as especially grueling, but ultimately worthwhile. Recording lasted from 6 June to mid September at Ocean Way Studio One and Summa Music Group Studios. The basic tracks were handled at Ocean Way, while overdubs and mixing was at Summa. Trumpeter Mark Isham was hired for a few overdubs. Virgin threatened to drop the project several times due to the broken budget, which grew upwards to $250,000 ($ in ). A lot of the money went into studio personnel salaries, as well as the members&#x27; and their families&#x27; living expenses in Los Angeles.

Fox was determined to treat the group with more patience than Rundgren had for &quot;Skylarking&quot;. The sessions ran more smoothly as a result, although the group struggled with his inexperience as a producer. About a quarter of the songs were recorded without a click track. Partridge praised Mastelotto for his work ethic: &quot;he actually made little samples of sounds and things in his garage for us to use. He was really very committed to being one of the band&quot;. One such sample was the sound of a snare drum with its waveform cut off before the attack. Mastelotto said &quot;Andy loved it so much that it turned out to be almost on the entire record.&quot; He had been a longtime fan of XTC and prepared for the recording by asking them for their favourite records &quot;so that I could maybe get a little further inside their head&quot;.

One of the recurring in-jokes during the sessions was a spin-the-wheel dial used for determining takes. The wheel&#x27;s labels were &quot;Great – best take ever&quot;, &quot;better than the Beatles&quot;, &quot;pretty good&quot;, &quot;okay&quot;, &quot;not so good&quot;, &quot;possibly acceptable&quot;, &quot;pretty bad&quot;, &quot;weak&quot;, &quot;horrible&quot;, &quot;dreadful&quot;, and &quot;the worst shit I&#x27;d ever heard&quot;. Another in-joke was the &quot;Colonel Cunt Hat&quot; and &quot;Thumb of Decision&quot; that anyone would wear if it was thought that they had a poor attitude. During one early session, Mastelotto recalled:

Dave Gregory, in his words, took credit for &quot;quite a lot [of] the arrangements and the overdubs&quot;. He was frustrated that his suggestions to Fox were almost always deferred to &quot;the songwriter&quot;, which meant either Partridge or Moulding. Both Gregory and Moulding characterised Fox as subservient to Partridge&#x27;s studio indulgences, which they termed &quot;Andy-ness&quot;, and felt that it had a negative effect on the album&#x27;s sound. Guests who visited the sessions included Elvis Costello, who was next door recording his album &quot;Spike&quot; (1989), KROQ disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer, Chris Squire of Yes, David Byrne of Talking Heads and actor River Phoenix. Partridge has said that Phoenix was an &quot;utter and anal&quot; fan of the band, and urged him to phone a friend who was &quot;also a big fan&quot;, Keanu Reeves.

===Equipment and mixing===

Moulding used primarily a Wal bass with a Fender P-Bass as backup. Partridge played a 
Squier Telecaster and a Martin D-35. Fox, who had a background as a session keyboardist, supplied the group with numerous digital and analogue synthesizers (mainly an Emulator III and a Roland Super Jupiter). A variety of drum machines were also used and mixed in tandem with Mastelotto&#x27;s live drumming. Care was taken to ensure that the percussion was tuned to each song. The group also frequently used the &quot;warp&quot; feature of an Akai sampler to bend percussion notes.

Many details, such as different hi-hat patterns, were not chosen until the mixing stages—when it was decided to include all of them. Partridge reflected that &quot;the finished songs&quot; were perhaps &quot;a little too busy all the time ... But it was a case of, you just left everything in the mix to perhaps weed out later, but didn&#x27;t in fact weed out. ... But, that&#x27;s okay -- it was fine for us at the time&quot;. Gregory thought &quot;we probably did a little too much on one or two of the songs, but ... it&#x27;s a great album, a really great collection of songs.&quot; Partridge did not attend all of the album&#x27;s mixing sessions due to a bout of depression spurred by the Reid litigation. &quot;Literally half a million pounds had gone flapping out the window to various parties and it depressed me incredibly,&quot; he remembered. &quot;I started to drink heavily in those last few weeks and went off the rails a bit. I had to get back to England to calm myself down.&quot; He left them with &quot;a long list of requirements ... in the mixing&quot; and returned home on 7 October, likely with Moulding, while Gregory stayed for the end of mixing. Work on the album was completed when the group approved Fox&#x27;s final mix on 22 October. By then, the project had gone at least £30,000 over budget.

==Songs==
===Side one===

&quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, the album&#x27;s psychedelic opening song, is written as a children&#x27;s guide to the world. Partridge&#x27;s reaction to listening to the song for the first time after many years was &quot;&quot;Jesus&quot; there&#x27;s a lot on this track!&quot; He intended the piece to sound &quot;like this crazy tapestry of camels and elephants and belly dancers and all the Arabian Nights, interwoven -- a big ornate Eastern rug come to life&quot;. One of the slide-down parts was played by turning down the tuning peg of Moulding&#x27;s bass guitar. Partridge refused to answer whether the lyric &quot;can&#x27;t all think like Chekov&quot; refers to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; character Pavel Chekov, or the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov.

&quot;Mayor of Simpleton&quot; adopts a jangle pop style. It developed as a reggae tune and went through numerous different versions. He settled on its final arrangement after discovering a C major to D major picking pattern that he thought resembled Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; (1976). Unlike many other XTC songs, he instructed a specific bass part to Moulding: &quot;Colin had to work very hard to get that bass line. It&#x27;s very precise. It took me a long time to work it out, because I wanted to get into the J.S. Bach mode of each note being the perfect counterpoint to where the chords are and where the melody is. The bass is the third part in the puzzle.&quot; The lyrics, partly autobiographical, are sometimes criticised for their similarity to Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful World&quot; (1960), but Partridge denied copying the song intentionally. He stated, however, that the ending was a &quot;slight tip of the hat&quot; to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; (1966).

&quot;King for a Day&quot; was composed from an alternate guitar tuning. Moulding credited Partridge with the &quot;bell-like&quot; counterpoint melody, and recalled that the backwards effect on the guitar may have been accidental. Virgin earmarked the song as potentially the album&#x27;s lead single and commissioned a number of remixes for the song. Moulding said he had no input on these alternate versions and remembered that they &quot;really stretched the budget to the limit&quot;.

&quot;Here Comes President Kill Again&quot; is a sociopolitical song arranged in a marching band style. Partridge: &quot;I&#x27;m just saying, &#x27;Go ahead, have your little bit of power and vote for who you want, but there&#x27;s no difference&#x27; ... it&#x27;s almost like, if they&#x27;re a politician, that&#x27;s the very reason you shouldn&#x27;t vote for them&quot;. The &quot;President Nil&quot; mentioned in its lyric refers to the character from the Alan Sillitoe book &quot;Travels in Nihilon&quot;, which itself originated the title of the past XTC song from &quot;Black Sea&quot; (1980). Partridge described the middle section as a simulacrum of the Beatles&#x27; 1968 self-titled album.

===Side two===

&quot;The Loving&quot; is a singalong anthem that was, according to Partridge, a rewrite of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; (1967). The inspiration for the music came from the Supremes&#x27; &quot;The Happening&quot; and Honeybus&#x27; &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Maggie Go&quot;. He added that he &quot;wanted something anthemic like &#x27;All the Young Dudes&#x27;&quot;. Mastelotto recalled the sampled crowd noises at the beginning was his suggestion to Fox, except he meant the crowd to be much smaller in size. The song initially began as a &quot;Madonna feel -- kind of a rock beat, very tight-sounding&quot; until they later did &quot;a few more takes of [the song], completely live -- the opposite of what we&#x27;d done earlier&quot;.

&quot;Poor Skeleton Steps Out&quot; features a samba-style rhythm, glockenspiel and numerous slowed down voices. Partridge said of its percussion: &quot;things that you might think are drums and percussion on that song may be things like guitars with paper threaded through the strings ... And something that sounds like a vacuum cleaner starting up is an electronic cymbal set to &#x27;ascend,&#x27; and there&#x27;s also a sample of a tabla playing along.&quot; He remembered that David Byrne, when he visited the session, was impressed with the track&#x27;s guitar textures and use of tabla.

&quot;One of the Millions&quot; is a song Moulding addressed to himself and his tendency to take the paths of least resistance. Its bass riff evoked to him the feeling of a rocking boat and it is one of the few songs on the album that was cut live without a click track.

&quot;Scarecrow People&quot;, built on a &quot;horsey&quot; rhythm, is cited by Partridge as his favourite on the record. It was written as an outlet for his longtime fascination with the word &quot;straw&quot;. The lyrics are about mankind&#x27;s value of &quot;trash above worthwhile things. ... We&#x27;re still shaped like human beings, but there&#x27;s no thought process going on.&quot; He could not identify what key it is in and noted that the opening guitar chord (D-E-B-E or C) contains none of the notes of the melody. According to music writer Geoffrey Himes, the song &quot;recalls the music-hall feel and &#x27;Babbitt&#x27; theme&quot; of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; (1965). Partridge felt there was a resemblance to Prince&#x27;s &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; (1987), &quot;It&#x27;s very kind of cartoon Blues ... then the chorus is kind of when it gets more conventional corny Country. It could be Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison or something.&quot; He credited the cascading 16th-notes – played on guitar by Dave Gregory and heard in the stereo right channel – as the song&#x27;s centerpiece. Moulding&#x27;s bass was outfitted with a faulty mute, resulting in a &quot;sitar bass&quot; effect. The rhythm in the bridge was inspired by Sly and Robbie&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; (1981).

===Side three===
&quot;Merely a Man&quot;, according to Partridge, was &quot;the idea of a juxtaposition -- noisy, barking, aggressive bass, aggressive guitars, and very metallic-sounding drums, juxtaposed with this rather effeminate 18th-century powdered wig of a piece of music, right smack bang in the middle of a hard-rocking wah-wah quackout&quot;. It was his attempt to appease Virgin&#x27;s requests for more rock-oriented material in the style of ZZ Top. He said that the guitar line has some similarities with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; (1967), however, the decision to place a baroque trumpet solo was not a reference to the group. Gregory and Fox envisioned the song as a single. The lyrics are about &quot;if there was a Jesus, if there was a Buddha, if there was a whatever great holy leader you&#x27;d like to name, there&#x27;s nothing supernatural about them. They are merely men.&quot; It contains a reference to Jimmy Swaggart in the lyric.

&quot;Cynical Days&quot; was described by a &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; reviewer as Moulding &quot;finding his symmetrical vocal/bass compositional counterpart recalling &quot;Mummer&quot;″s more disjointed approach&quot;. Like &quot;One of the Millions&quot;, the band played live without a click. A reviewer for the magazine &quot;Sonics&quot; compared it to Miles Davis, because of its use of muted trumpet, and Ray Davies of the Kinks. Moulding said: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t feeling cynical when I wrote it. I think it had more to do with the melancholy nature of the chords. Sometimes you play something and these sentiments descend on you.&quot; Later, he expressed dissatisfaction with the track, calling it too &quot;loungey&quot;.

&quot;Across This Antheap&quot; is a track built on &quot;Latin percussion, my swampy, pulled Bluesy guitar, and Colin&#x27;s burping little bass&quot;. The lyrics are &quot;about the human inability to communicate. No more than these ants can communicate. ... and yes, there is a very cynical eye being cast on the human race.&quot; It was originally written for &quot;Skylarking&quot; but rejected by Todd Rundgren. Gregory wanted the song to be the album&#x27;s closing track but his suggestion was vetoed. Fox considered it a potential single and urged Partridge to include &quot;&#x27;a kind of tacky, brassy-sounding keyboard,&quot; which I really didn&#x27;t like, but he said, &#x27;Yeah, it&#x27;s so awful, it&#x27;s almost ironic!&#x27; I just found it awful-sounding. ... I thought, &#x27;He&#x27;s had some good decisions as we&#x27;ve gone along so far—maybe he&#x27;s right!&#x27;&quot; Partridge programmed the percussion samples on a LinnDrum and Mastelloto played along on a kit. The end of the song includes the voices of the band members, Fox, and guests who visited the session that day, who may have included River Phoenix, Chris Squire, or journalist Neville Farmer.

===Side four===
&quot;Hold Me My Daddy&quot; was written from the point of view of a son begging for his father&#x27;s love. It also features South African-styled choral stylings and an Afro-pop coda. Partridge played the song for his father, who &quot;insisted on hearing it. We got to that point on the album and I had to leave the room: &#x27;Hm! Is that the baby crying? I&#x27;ll just go and have a look&#x27;. l came back, and I don&#x27;t know if he was embarrassed or whether he really didn&#x27;t hear the lyrics&quot;.

&quot;Pink Thing&quot; is a comedic pivot point of the album, being a song that Partridge wrote about his penis. The title was also a nickname he had for his children as infants. Partridge intended the two meanings to be ambiguous: &quot;The entire song centres on these two themes at the same time ... The first of the two you see, prevents seeing the other one.&quot; It has been compared to the style of Paul McCartney.

&quot;Miniature Sun&quot; is a jazz fusion song that invokes the sun as a metaphor for love and betrayal. It was written on the same budget sampler synthesizer as &quot;Skylarking&quot;″s &quot;Another Satellite&quot;. Richard Walls said that it resembled &quot;the Beach Boys playing fusion, a kind of number that&#x27;s becoming an XTC staple&quot;.
&quot;Chalkhills and Children&quot; is the album&#x27;s closing track and is its mellowest song. Partridge wrote it as a rumination on his life and career. He summarized: &quot;Show business is all fake. Being a father is not fake, and the hills around [my home] are not fake.&quot; It was composed on a Roland D-50 with a second oscillator tuned a fifth above. The lyric imagery came afterward, since he associated the sounds of organs with dreams. He acknowledged that the song bears a resemblance to the Beach Boys and decided to pay homage to their 1967 song &quot;Wind Chimes&quot; by including the use of wind chimes. Beach Boy Brian Wilson was played the track during an appearance on Rodney Bingenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Rodney on the ROQ&quot;. When the song was over, Bingenheimer mentioned that Partridge was a big fan of Wilson&#x27;s, to which Wilson tersely replied &quot;Yeah.&quot;

===Leftover===
A couple of Partridge&#x27;s rejected &quot;Skylarking&quot; songs were offered for &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot;, but were again rejected. He said: &quot;Maybe it was fate that they wouldn&#x27;t rise up. They are probably too weak and best left to die.&quot; &quot;The Good Things&quot;, a &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;-influenced Moulding song demoed for &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot;, was passed for inclusion. Moulding: &quot;If you can imagine a father reading from a book called &quot;The Good Things in Life&quot; to his children at bedtime, that just about sums it up.&quot; In 1995, the band recorded the song for the tribute album &quot;A Testimonial Dinner: The Songs of XTC&quot;. Similarly, his &quot;In Another Life&quot; was recorded and released for &quot;Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2)&quot; (2000).

Other songs demoed were Partridge&#x27;s &quot;Living in a Haunted Heart&quot;, &quot;Blue Beret&quot;, &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Was a Yes&quot;, &quot;My Paint Heroes&quot;, &quot;This Is the End&quot; and Moulding&#x27;s &quot;Skeletons&quot;, and &quot;Way of the World&quot;. &quot;Living in the Haunted Heart&quot; received a lukewarm reaction from bandmates. &quot;My Paint Heroes&quot; was a tribute to Joan Miró, Henri Rousseau, and Salvador Dalí. &quot;Skeletons&quot;, according to Moulding, &quot;doesn&#x27;t connect. It was a half-hearted attempt to tell my kids to watch what they do but I&#x27;m not very good at demos.&quot; The band also worked on Moulding&#x27;s &quot;The World is Full of Angry Young Men&quot;, from the &quot;Mummer&quot; sessions, rerecording the piano, guitar, and vocals.

==Title and artwork==
A working title for the album was &quot;Songs of Sixpence&quot;. &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; derives from the traditional English nursery rhyme of the same name, previously referenced in the opening lyric of &quot;Ballet for a Rainy Day&quot; from &quot;Skylarking&quot;. Partridge interpreted the nursery rhyme to be about financial debt and said that the title &quot;sort of, in a bizarre way, describes California as well&quot;. He said, &quot;It was not an LA album musically so much, but an LA album in kind of sunshine and citrus fruits, and it plugged me straight into the pop art vibe.&quot; Asked for likes or dislikes about Los Angeles, he responded: &quot;I hate the sunshine. All of that constant sunshine drives me up the wall. I like mysterious weather. I think it rained one day and it was so wonderful.&quot; Although he had been a fan of Pink Floyd since his youth, the title was not meant as a reference to their 1967 single &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot;.

The idea for a pop art-style sleeve came from Dave Gregory, who expressed fondness for the sleeve to the Who&#x27;s &quot;A Quick One&quot; (1966), while the lettering was inspired by Andy Williams&#x27; &quot;Love, Andy&quot; (1967). Its cover illustration was intended to resemble the work of Heinz Edelmann, the art director for the 1968 Beatles film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, and is reflective of the substantial portion of the album that pays homage to the Beatles&#x27; psychedelic period.

==Release==

Released on 27 February 1989 in the UK and one day later in the US, &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; became their highest-charting album since &quot;English Settlement&quot;, rising to number 28 in the UK and number 44 in the US. Additionally, it combined with &quot;Skylarking&quot; for the group&#x27;s best-selling albums to date. Lead single &quot;Mayor of Simpleton&quot; reached number 46 in the UK and number 72 in the US, making it their only American single to chart. It was followed with &quot;King for a Day&quot; (backed with &quot;Happy Families&quot; along with home demo versions of &quot;My Paint Heroes&quot; and &quot;Skeletons&quot;) and &quot;The Loving&quot;, the latter of which failed to chart. The music video for &quot;King for a Day&quot; was directed by Tony Kaye. Versions of &quot;Scarecrow People&quot; and &quot;Poor Skeleton Steps Out&quot; were recorded for BBC Radio and later released for &quot;Drums and Wireless: BBC Radio Sessions 77–89&quot; (1994).

To support the album, Partridge agreed to an acoustic-guitar American radio tour that lasted for two weeks in May. The shows were carried out without financial compensation for the band. According to him, this stripped-down convention had fallen out of style since the 1930s, and he suggested the idea to avoid potential issues with more complex sound mixing. The setlists primarily consisted of &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; material. He recalled the first gig was &quot;a total shambles&quot; but that the rest of the tour went &quot;absolutely fine ... and I started to enjoy it&quot;. Gregory commented that it was an &quot;interesting&quot; style of promotion, but &quot;incredibly hard work&quot;, as the band performed at about four radio stations a day for three weeks: &quot;We also did a live acoustic set for MTV in front of an audience which worried Andy a bit but he got through it.&quot; This inspired the network to invite more artists to perform stripped-down sets, calling the series &quot;unplugged&quot;. XTC&#x27;s performance of &quot;King for a Day&quot; on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; marked the first time the group played in front of a live audience in seven years. A similar acoustic tour was planned for Europe, but cancelled when Partridge discovered that their pro bono Paris date would be broadcast from a sold-out 5,000 seater venue.

The album&#x27;s release coincided with the band resolving their legal disputes against Reid with an out-of-court settlement. They agreed to let Virgin pay off their remaining debts in exchange for a less favourable royalty adjustment and a promise to record four more albums for the label. Afterward, the band tried to coax Partridge back into regular touring but were unsuccessful. It was estimated that a three to four-week US tour leading to a gig in Madison Square Garden could have earned each member about $100,000. Moulding intimated: &quot;It annoyed me that we weren&#x27;t getting anywhere with Andy because we could all see he&#x27;d got over his stage fright problem. Now he was just making excuses.&quot;

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary===
&quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; was met with critical acclaim. A reviewer for &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; declared it to be another album of the band&#x27;s &quot;ever-winning, ever-esoteric pop&quot; and &quot;as good as any in their catalogue,&quot; highlighting &quot;Mayor of Simpleton&quot;, &quot;The Loving&quot;, &quot;Merely a Man&quot;, and &quot;King for a Day&quot; as its best tracks. Chris Heim of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised the album as a &quot;refreshingly tart and wondrously rich harvest of intelligent and challenging pop&quot;. &quot;The Loving&quot; was voted &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;Single of the Week&quot; by guest reviewers the Wonder Stuff, a British band.

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Michael Azerrad dubbed the LP &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;ultimately delightful&quot;. He acknowledged that first-time listeners may be &quot;overwhelmed by the densely layered arrangements and center-stage percussion. But on repeated listenings, the curtains part and hooks are all you hear&quot;. Richard Walls of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; opined: &quot;It&#x27;s possible for [the album] to charm you into thinking it&#x27;s a lightheartedly benign bauble. The components of the disc&#x27;s well-crafted and pleasurable surface ... all conspire to elicit a smiling response.&quot; Brent Milano of &quot;Pulse!&quot; stated: &quot;we can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking [this record], unless you&#x27;ve got a real problem with brilliant songwriting, personal-yet-universal lyrics, great singing and nifty guitar sounds. XTC can absorb &#x27;60s tricks as well as anyone ... but it doesn&#x27;t stop there. There weren&#x27;t many &#x27;60s bands who worked tributes to King Sunny Ade and Ladysmith Black Mambazo into a straightahead pop song&quot; (&quot;Hold Me My Daddy&quot;).

Robert Sandall of &quot;Q&quot; believed that the group were &quot;obsessed&quot; with the Beatles, specifically Paul McCartney circa 1967–1968. He concluded that the music was &quot;Exuberantly catchy ... and mercifully free of that whiff of self-conscious art school cleverness which has blighted XTC in the past, these songs are thrilling before you catch their sophistication.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Geoffrey Himes praised the record as proof &quot;that McCartney&#x27;s psychedelic pop was not just a product of a particular time, but rather a set of possibilities that have hardly been exhausted&quot;. Michael Small of &quot;People&quot; compared it favourably to the Beatles&#x27; White Album: &quot;Almost every song contains at least one catchy pop riff or chorus. Then those bright tunes abruptly shift into minor keys or unusual rhythms and harmonies.&quot;

Conversely, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Bob Stafford felt that although the record includes &quot;a handful of &quot;great&quot; pop songs ... there is simply &quot;too much&quot; going on most of the time ... as a double [LP], it allows for too much mediocrity and silliness, meandering tunes, and unnecessary techno plonks.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said the album lacked a &quot;discernible&quot; structure or concept to guide the band&#x27;s &quot;compulsive&quot; formalism. Chris Murray of &quot;RPM&quot; wrote: &quot;From start to finish, this LP is full of Andy Partridge&#x27;s idiosyncratic songs, true to the form XTC has established over the past decade. Unfortunately, this sold record breaks no new ground which might elevate them from the presently secure cult status.&quot; Gary Ramon called it an &quot;uneven&quot; collection containing &quot;the weakest&quot; songs of Moulding.

===Retrospective===
In 2000, &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; was ranked at number 906 in the third edition Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

Among retrospective reviews, Oregano Rathbone of &quot;Record Collector&quot; wrote that &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; was &quot;an appropriately sunny thing on the surface, at peace with itself and the world, yet seething with a bracingly chilly English subtext of proudly acknowledged failings ... thwarted ambition ... existential anomie ... and political disillusionment&quot;. J.R. Jones of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; criticized the record for being &quot;mostly rewrites of earlier songs&quot; and its music for &quot;recycling the same psychedelic guitar riffs and Beatles-esque countermelodies that the band parodied&quot; as the Dukes.

&quot;The Quietus&quot;″ Nick Reed said that while the album contains several of the band&#x27;s best songs, &quot;whether or not this album holds up for you depends on how much you like the band&#x27;s boisterous side.&quot; He likened the songs to candy bars: &quot;the first few are enjoyable, but fifteen in a row can make you sick to your stomach.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the LP &quot;lacks the singular focus of &quot;Skylarking&quot;, but at its best, it&#x27;s just as impressive as its predecessor. ... sonically rich and filled with immaculately crafted songs&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Phelps&quot; (DD-360) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy. She was named for Thomas Stowell Phelps, who was a Rear Admiral in the US Navy in 1884.

==Before World War II==

&quot;Phelps&quot; was laid down 2 January 1934 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 18 July 1935; sponsored by Mrs. Richard A. Kearny; and commissioned 26 February 1936, Commander Albert H. Rooks in command. In November 1936 &quot;Phelps&quot;, along with the cruiser &quot;Chester&quot;, escorted the heavy cruiser &quot;Indianapolis&quot; carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Buenos Aires, Argentina for the opening of the Inter-American Peace Conference of 1936. The cruise included good-will visits to Montevideo, Uruguay and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

==Entry in World War II==

During the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Phelps&quot; shot down one enemy plane. In February and March 1942, she served as part of the destroyer screen for Task Force 11, including the carrier , in an attack in the Huon Gulf off Lae and in an attack on Salamaua, New Guinea, over the Owen Stanley mountain range from the Gulf of Papua, 10 March 1942. During the Battle of the Coral Sea beginning on 8 May, when &quot;Lexington&quot; and diverged to avoid enemy attacks, &quot;Phelps&quot; stayed with &quot;Yorktown&quot;. &quot;Phelps&quot; emerged from the battle with no casualties, but when the &quot;Lexington&quot; was seriously damaged, she helped to prevent enemy capture of the carrier by administering the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; and finished her off firing five torpedoes.

==Aleutians and Central Pacific action==

In June 1942 she protected the American carriers that dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese Navy in the Battle of Midway. In August 1942 she guarded forces invading Guadalcanal. After a visit to the west coast in October, she participated in landings upon Attu, Alaska, in May 1943. After bombarding Kiska, Alaska, she provided gunfire support for landings at Makin Atoll in November 1943. In the Marshall Islands campaign in February 1944, she bombarded Kwajalein and Eniwetok. In March she guarded tankers during a strike on the Palau Islands. In June she bombarded Saipan to protect American forces that had landed there on the 15th.

==Atlantic duty==

Following duty at Saipan, she steamed via the Panama Canal to Charleston, South Carolina, for armament alterations, arriving 2 August. Departing Norfolk, Virginia, in November, she escorted a convoy to Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria. After three more convoy escort voyages to the Mediterranean in 1945, she arrived at New York, New York 10 June.

==Decommissioning==

The &quot;Phelps&quot; was decommissioned on 6 November 1945, and she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 28 January 1947. She was scrapped shortly afterwards by Northern Metals Co. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Battle honors==
&quot;Phelps&quot; received twelve battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Cornerstone is a relational database for MS-DOS released by Infocom, a company best known in the 1980s for developing interactive fiction video games. Initially hailed upon release in 1985 for its ease of use, a series of shortcomings and changes in the market kept Cornerstone from achieving success. It is considered a key factor in Infocom&#x27;s demise.

==Development==
Games were only considered a &quot;jumping off&quot; point for Infocom. It was originally established as an outlet to develop &quot;serious&quot; products. Before forming the company, several of the founders had created the game &quot;Zork&quot; on mainframes while attending or working at MIT. When they joined to form Infocom, &quot;Zork&quot; was a natural choice as a first product because it was practically complete and didn&#x27;t require much up-front funding. The enormous success of the game and its &quot;sequels&quot; (which were actually the other portions of the original mainframe game, which had been split into pieces that early personal computers could handle) led to the development of more interactive titles, due in large part to the highly portable technology the company developed for intelligent parsing. Despite the overwhelming success of its numerous game titles, the original founders of Infocom were still intent on developing serious titles. In addition, business software was seen as more lucrative than game titles since business traditionally paid thousands of dollars for each copy of software applications. After some deliberation, Infocom&#x27;s board of directors decided to develop a relational database application for business users.

===Contemporary databases===
Database applications contemporary with Cornerstone were fairly inaccessible to non-programmers. The leading database application of the day, &quot;dBase II&quot;, required complex command-line commands even for the simplest operations. The Cornerstone developers were determined to make ease-of-use their chief priority. Dozens of people were hired in programming, marketing and other areas to swell Infocom&#x27;s ranks to over 100 employees.

===Funding===
While development of Cornerstone was going well, it required an enormous amount of capital. Infocom borrowed heavily and used a sole source of venture capital. Profits from their interactive fiction titles were diverted to help fund Cornerstone, a move that disturbed many employees of the game division and led to an adversarial attitude towards the business division among some.

===Design decisions===
One development decision that proved fateful for the product—and the company as a whole—was the decision to make Cornerstone run via a virtual machine (VM). The use of Infocom&#x27;s &quot;Z-machine&quot; for its interactive titles had been a huge boon: since all the games were written in an intermediate language (called ZIL), the company could release one title for every major platform simultaneously. The developers hoped to do the same for Cornerstone and its subsequent products. The existing VM proved unsuitable for the database application, so a new one was written for the product. The developers produced the VM for the IBM PC first, planning to write VMs for other platforms after the initial PC release.

==Reception==
When Cornerstone was released in 1985, it was widely hailed as a giant leap forward in usability. All commands were menu-driven, an innovative feature at the time. Many powerful features never before seen were available, such as command-completion and context-sensitive help. One &quot;PC Week&quot; columnist wrote, &quot;Cornerstone is the best program I have ever used... the program is so easy to use, explaining its use is almost redundant. If you need a relational database, buy Cornerstone.&quot; One significant achievement noted by reviewers was that Infocom was able to contain the entire program on one floppy disk, a bonus provided by their use of their custom virtual machine (in addition to other facilities, it compressed text).

Infocom&#x27;s use of a VM affected performance. For simple operations, Cornerstone&#x27;s performance was fine. However, for intensive operations, such as importing text files and sorting, Cornerstone dragged, especially when compared to the dominant database available at the time of Cornerstone&#x27;s release, &quot;dBase III&quot;. One review noted that after waiting over three hours for a single text file to be imported, all similar benchmark tests were abandoned.

Additionally, users of &quot;dBase III&quot;, despite needing to use complex command-line commands, were able to repurpose databases for whatever uses they needed. They could even make stand-alone applications which used databases with the package. Macros could also be developed which automated many complex or repetitive tasks. Cornerstone, though it had many built-in convenience functions, wasn&#x27;t programmable. Some repetitive and complex tasks needed to be carried out by hand. Also, any operations on its databases needed to be carried out within the application; Cornerstone had no facilities for creating stand-alone specially purposed applications.

While Infocom&#x27;s use of a VM was a boon in some ways, the most significant advantage of its use – easy portability – was no longer an issue. During Cornerstone&#x27;s development, the IBM PC and its clones had emerged as the dominant business computer. While portability was still important for games, a business application could be successful running only on the PC. The product&#x27;s slow operation due to the VM was too great a disadvantage compared to other current offerings.

These failings may not have proved fatal were it not for the climate in which the product was released. In 1985, the computer industry took a downturn and many businesses that may have been potential customers were reluctant or unable to justify the purchase of the program. Cornerstone sold 10,000 copies. This may not have mattered to the company had game sales remained strong, but the industry downturn also affected Infocom&#x27;s game sales. Their sales performance was not as good as projected and the revenue provided by games was not enough to cover the development costs of the database. Though the company&#x27;s revenue for the year was over US$10 million, it was short of what was needed to keep the company solvent.

Additionally, the industry&#x27;s slump led several of Infocom&#x27;s creditors to call in their loans early. Infocom&#x27;s recently burgeoning ranks of employees suffered waves of layoffs and pay reductions.

==Impact on Infocom==
In 1986, Infocom was acquired by Activision, a large developer and publisher. Activision paid off Infocom&#x27;s outstanding debt as part of the deal. While the acquisition kept Infocom afloat for a few more years, poor management decisions led Activision to close Infocom in 1989.

<doc id="859449" wikidata="Q1418227" url="?curid=859449" title="Hot toddy">
<text>A hot toddy, also known as hot whiskey in Ireland, and occasionally called southern cough syrup within the Southern United States, is typically a mixed drink made of liquor and water with honey (or in some recipes, sugar), lemon, and spices, and served hot. Recipes vary, and hot toddy is traditionally drunk as a nightcap before retiring for the night, in wet or cold weather, or to relieve the symptoms of the cold and flu. In &quot;How to Drink&quot;, Victoria Moore describes the drink as &quot;the vitamin C for health, the honey to soothe, the alcohol to numb.&quot;

==Preparation==
A hot toddy is a mixture of a spirit (usually whisky), hot water, and honey (or, in some recipes, sugar). In Canada, maple syrup may be used. Additional ingredients such as cloves, a lemon slice or cinnamon (in stick or ground form) are often also added.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;toddy&quot; comes from the toddy drink in India, produced by fermenting the sap of palm trees. Its earliest known use to mean &quot;a beverage made of alcoholic liquor with hot water, sugar, and spices&quot; is from 1786. It is often referred to as a &#x27;Hot Toady&#x27;. However, a few other sources credit Robert Bentley Todd for his prescription of a hot drink of brandy, canella (white cinnamon), sugar syrup, and water.

==Variations==
A cold toddy is made with rye whiskey, oranges, lemons, cinnamon sticks, ginger, Earl Grey tea, cloves, honey, and orange or regular bitters. It is served with ice and stirred until it is very cold.

==History==

Its origins are in The Three Rivers Regiment, a militia (Reserve Force) regiment based in Trois-Rivières, a town halfway between Montreal and Quebec City. It originally formed in 1871 as the Three Rivers Provisional Battalion of Infantry. This was a new battalion headquarters that united four previously independent infantry companies that had been formed in 1869 at Trois-Rivières, Rivière-du-Loup-en-Haut, Berthier-en-Haut and Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon. The battalion was given a number in 1880 (86th &quot;Three Rivers&quot; Battalion of Infantry) and raised to regiment status in 1900 (86th Three Rivers Regiment).

In the First World War, the Canadian militia infantry units were not mobilized, but instead new units were formed from volunteers from the militia and new recruits. The militia units generally became organizations for recruiting, induction and preliminary training. The 86th Regiment recruited the 178th &quot;Overseas&quot; Battalion, CEF, in 1916. The 178th Battalion was broken up in England in 1917, but enough of its former members fought at the Battle of Amiens (1918) that the battalion qualified for a battle honour, which the 12e RBC perpetuates.

The regiment also perpetuates the 259th Battalion, Canadian Rifles, Canadian Expeditionary Force (Siberia).

In the post-war reorganization of the Militia, the 86th Regiment lost its number, becoming simply The Three Rivers Regiment. In the 1936 reorganization, it became an infantry tank unit, The Three Rivers Regiment (Tank).

In the Second World War, the regiment mobilized an armoured regiment, which sailed to England in 1941. After two years of training, the 12th Armoured Regiment (Three Rivers Regiment) landed in Sicily, where it supported 1st Canadian Infantry Division throughout Operation Husky almost exclusively and gained a reputation for tenacity and courage. The 12th CAR was the first Canadian armoured regiment to destroy panzers in battle; a Panzer III and one of the Mark IV &quot;Specials&quot; were destroyed by its men at Grammichele on July 15. The regiment also took part Operation Baytown, landings on the Italian mainland in September 1943, as well and were often called upon to support British infantry battalions based on their quiet professionalism. Though the formation it was part of was originally known as 1st Tank Brigade, the name was changed to 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade later on.

After the war, the regiment was given a (partially) French name: Le Régiment de Trois-Rivières (24th Armoured Regiment).

In 1968 the regiment was renamed and expanded to include a new Regular Force regiment in addition to the original Militia regiment. The Regular Force unit is called 12e Régiment blindé du Canada, and the Militia unit is named 12e Régiment blindé du Canada (Militia) (or in French, ). The number in the regimental title commemorates the Second World War unit, 12th Armoured Regiment (Three Rivers Regiment).

== Alliances ==
* – Royal Tank Regiment
* – 2e Régiment de hussards
* - 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion

==Battle honours==
In the list below, battle honours in capitals were awarded for participation in large operations and campaigns, while those in lowercase indicate honours granted for more specific battles. Those battle honours in bold type are emblazoned on the regimental guidon.

===War of 1812===
* Non-emblazonable honorary distinction 

===Great War===
* 

===Second World War===
===War in Afghanistan===
Notes:
== Trois-Rivières Military Museum ==

The museum collects, preserves, researches, interprets and exhibits artifacts which reflect the military history of Trois-Rivières, the 12th Armoured Regiment (Three Rivers Regiment) story and the history of the Canadian Militia. The museum serves as a training medium to teach regimental history, and to stimulate and foster within the general public an ongoing interest in the regiment, its activities and accomplishments. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, OMMC and Virtual Museum of Canada.

==Order of precedence==
===Regular Force===
While the regiment is the oldest of the Regular Force armoured regiments, its Regular Force component takes its precedence from its date of entry into the Regular Force (1968). The Reserve Force component continues to take its precedence from 1871 within the Reserve Force.

<text>The Puli was a microcar made in Hungary by &quot;HÓDGÉP&quot; of Hódmezővásárhely from 1986.

The car was 2.46 m long and was assembled using parts made by Ikarus, Škoda, Lada and Polski Fiat available at that time in the country. It was propelled by a Diesel engine of 4 kW, or an electric engine of 7.4 kW.

The body was made from reinforced glass fibre. It was intended to be exported mainly to France where no driving licence was needed to drive that category of vehicles. The company&#x27;s profile was agricultural machinery building and did not survive the political-economical transition of Hungary to a market economy at the end of the 1980s.

The electric version was produced in 1991 under the name &quot;Puli Pinguin 4&quot;.

In 2006 the Puli returned under the ownership of Prokop Gábor. Prokop holds Puli and Wartburg trade marks.

<doc id="859478" wikidata="Q1799872" url="?curid=859478" title="Rowan University">
<text>Rowan University is a public research university in Glassboro, New Jersey, with a medical campus in Stratford and medical and academic campuses in Camden. Founded in 1923 as Glassboro Normal School on a site donated by 107 residents, the school was formerly known as Glassboro State College from 1958 until 1992 and Rowan College of New Jersey from 1992 to 1997.

The university includes 14 colleges and schools with a total enrollment (undergraduate, graduate, and professional studies) of just over 19,600 students. Rowan offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, doctoral, and professional degree programs. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

== History ==

In the early part of the 20th century, there was a shortage of adequately trained teachers in the state of New Jersey. It was decided to build a two-year Normal school in the southern part of the state to counter the trend. Among the candidate towns, Glassboro became the location due in no small part to its easy access to passenger rail as well as its offer to donate of land to the state to build the Normal school. The 1917 purchase price of the property was raised by the residents of the town and used to purchase a tract that belonged to the Whitney family, who owned the local glassworks during the 19th century.

In 1923, the Glassboro Normal School opened with a class of 236 students, 226 women and 10 men, arriving at the train station in front of Bunce Hall. With the evolution of teacher training, the school became a four-year program in 1934; in 1937, the school was renamed The New Jersey State Teachers College at Glassboro and became co-educational shortly thereafter.

The college was one of the first in the country to begin programs for teachers for reading disabilities and physical therapy in 1935 and 1944, respectively. Glassboro State began to develop a reputation as a leader in special education. After several years and the return of soldiers from World War II, the college was able to expand its enrollment from a wartime low of 170 in 1943 to an expansion of several additional campus and academic programs over the next 15 years and became Glassboro State College in 1958.

=== Hollybush Summit ===

The Cold War Glassboro Summit Conference between U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin took place from June 23–25, 1967, in Hollybush Mansion on the campus of then-Glassboro State College. The college was chosen because of its location equidistant between New York City, where Kosygin was making a speech at the U.N., and Washington, D.C.

Then-college president Thomas E. Robinson was given just 16 hours&#x27; notice of the decision to hold the summit at GSC and, despite the lack of advance notice, converted his on-campus home into a secure location for the leaders of the world&#x27;s superpowers.

=== After the summit ===
The campus hosted hard rock band Black Sabbath&#x27;s first U.S. concert on October 30, 1970. Peaceful student protests occurred during the Vietnam war as they did at other campuses, but never required the college to close the campus.

The college made national news during &quot;Spring Weekend&quot; in 1986, due to a loud party atmosphere primarily off campus around the Beau Rivage townhouses and The Crossings apartment complex in which police from several municipalities were called in to break up the parties. The event led to Glassboro State College&#x27;s ranking as the #28 Party School in the nation in the January 1987 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

Though the alcohol-fueled Spring Weekend was canceled by then-President Herman James, a non-alcoholic version continued for several years, Glassboro State College remained known for its hard-partying culture. However, in 1988, there began one of the biggest crackdowns in school history. As a result of the drinking death of freshman James Callahan at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, Herman James decided to make GSC an example for the rest of the state colleges and universities to follow. He invited the New Jersey Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (ABC) to the school. He began shutting down off-campus parties and placing undercover agents in the local liquor establishments. This prompted Morton Downey Jr., who was based in Secaucus, New Jersey, and very popular at the time, to do an untelevised show focusing on the drinking age and the classic argument that an eighteen-year-old can go off to war and die for their country although they cannot legally buy and consume beer. The following year, the ABC did not return, and the partying atmosphere that Glassboro State College was known for returned in earnest and continued into the 1990s and early 2000s.

=== University status ===

In 1992, president Herman James oversaw the development of Glassboro State College into what would eventually become Rowan University. This transformation came about because of what was then the largest single gift to a public college or University in history. Industrialist Henry M. Rowan, Jr., a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology class of 1947, and his wife donated $100 million to the college, which later changed its name to Rowan College of New Jersey in his honor. The gift stipulated that the college open a College of Engineering, allowing the college to expand its course and curriculum offerings to the point that it became a full-fledged university, achieving that status in 1997. This status was given by the State of New Jersey based on Rowan University&#x27;s doctoral degree program, the Ed.D. in Educational Leadership, and the numerous master&#x27;s-level programs in education and business.

Following James&#x27; retirement as president in 1998, Donald J. Farish was chosen to succeed him and began further expansion on the Glassboro campus, opening a modern Science Hall in 2003 and a building to house the College of Education in 2005. In addition, acquisitions during the beginning of Farish&#x27;s tenure as president led to the development of a tract of land bordering US Route 322 and State Route 55 as the West Campus.

The presidency of Donald Farish was noted for a continued crackdown on the university&#x27;s partying culture, which declined alongside a rise in SAT scores and class rank among the incoming freshman classes. The crackdown on the partying culture began in earnest in 2002 with the official banning of kegs for use by Greek letter organizations. In 2006, two Rowan University students were found guilty for serving alcohol to minors at an off-campus party that resulted in the death of a 16-year-old male. Rowan promised to follow up with its own penalties.

==== West Campus ====
On March 20, 2006, Farish announced a joint venture between the university and Major League Soccer (MLS) to construct a new athletic complex based around a 20,000-seat soccer-specific stadium on property owned by the campus at the intersection of U.S. Route 322 and Route 55. Although the stadium was planned to be complete for the start of the 2009 MLS season, New Jersey&#x27;s 2006 budget problems resulted in cutbacks in funding for the infrastructure upgrades required by increased traffic related to an MLS team. When plan fell through, the stadium project was relocated to nearby Chester, Pennsylvania where the MLS&#x27;s Philadelphia Union now play their home matches.

The northern portion of the West Campus expansion currently contains the South Jersey Technology Park as well as room for future expansion; the southern portion of the West Campus expansion will accommodate both academic and athletic facilities. The university in 2015 opened a site across from the South Jersey Technology Park at Rowan University with practice fields for football, soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse. Transportation between the two campuses will be provided with both shuttle service and improved bike paths, as well as improvements to Route 322 itself.

On a vast site, adjacent to the West Campus athletic fields, the Inspira Medical Center complex opened in late 2019.

==== South Jersey Technology Park ====
Rowan University broke ground for the South Jersey Technology Park (SJTP) on April 10, 2006. The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) gave Rowan University $5.8 million to combine with $1.5 million from the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology, $1 million from Samuel H. Jones, and $1 million from Rowan itself. SJTP is planned to be a site which will serve as an establishment for science and technology companies as well as academics. It is planned to have 25 buildings to provide competitively priced Class &quot;A&quot; facilities for budding entrepreneurs, start-up and established companies. SJTP was incorporated as a non-profit corporation with its own board of directors.
The first building, the Samuel H. Jones Innovation Center, has been leased completely out, and the revenue will help build a second building.

The Tech Park&#x27;s first incubated business, SocialReach, has successfully graduated into its own offices in Philadelphia.

The second planned building will be approximately divided between research and technology labs and offices.

==== Campus crimes ====
In December 1972, Stephen Setrin was stabbed while on the grounds of Glassboro State College 

On August 12, 1996, 22-year-old Cindy Nannay was fatally shot outside Bozorth Hall by her estranged boyfriend, who then killed himself. Nannay was so afraid of Scott Lonabaugh, 27, that when he arrived on the campus to see her, she asked friends to accompany her to the parking lot, the Gloucester County Prosecutor&#x27;s office said. As her friends looked on, Mr. Lonabaugh shot Ms. Nannay twice with a shotgun and then shot himself in the head, prosecutors said. Both died at the scene.

Eleven years later, in 2007, another student was murdered on campus. Sophomore Donald Farrell, 19, was robbed and beaten to death by unknown assailants while walking behind the Triad dormitory. A reward of $100,000 has been offered for information leading to the capture, arrest and conviction of the assailants. In an effort to find Farrell&#x27;s assailants, television stations in Philadelphia, New Jersey and New York City aired reports on the murder, and America&#x27;s Most Wanted twice featured segments on the incident.

Following Farrell&#x27;s murder a new campus security initiative was undertaken, starting with a 14-point plan proposed by President Farish. The plan included hiring additional security staff, adding more fully trained police officers, starting a student patrol program, an expansion of the Safe Walk and Ride program, improving lighting in and around campus, installation of CCTV cameras, and changing security and police coverage from an 8-hour to a 12-hour shift.

=== Cooper Medical School ===
It was announced on June 26, 2009, that Rowan would be partnering with Cooper University Hospital to create a new four-year medical school to reside on Broadway in Camden. Rowan was chosen by governor Jon Corzine to house the new medical school primarily because the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) was not in a financial position to fund the creation of the school, for which Rowan issued $100 million in bonds.

The new school would require no new funding as $28 million would be diverted from UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, which will no longer be associated with Cooper University Hospital after the opening of Cooper Medical School. Opening in 2012 with an entering class of 50, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University was the only medical school in the state not affiliated with UMDNJ before their closing. It was the first new medical school in New Jersey in at least 30 years.

The Cooper Medical School of Rowan University was granted preliminary accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education on June 10, 2011.

=== Medical and Health Sciences Education Restructuring Act ===
In January 2012, a state advisory committee proposed a plan to merge Rowan with the Camden campus of Rutgers University (which would have been separated from Rutgers) under Rowan&#x27;s name. The project was opposed by the Rutgers governing boards, faculty, students, and alumni, and by others in the state. Legislation passed in June 2012 rejected the idea of a merger, though it did include provisions for a loose collaboration between Rowan and Rutgers-Camden limited to research and teaching in the health sciences. This legislation, the &quot;New Jersey Medical and Health Sciences Education Restructuring Act&quot; (A3102 &amp; S2063), enacted several essential changes to Rowan:

* Rowan University was granted Research University status and was granted increased state funding.
* Rowan University acquired the University of Medicine and Dentistry&#x27;s (UMDNJ) Stratford-based School of Osteopathic Medicine. Rowan joined Michigan State University as the only institutions in the country to operate both a DO and an MD medical school. The acquisition also included the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS).
* A joint Rowan/Rutgers-Camden governing board was created to oversee the development and operation of collaborative programs in the health sciences.

=== Student deaths and mental health support ===
The university faced criticism for not providing more mental health resources and support for students after four students committed suicide between 2019 and 2021. Following the student deaths in 2019, the university expanded its resources better accommodate students&#x27; mental health, including bringing the number of counselors employed to 17 and partnering with TogetherAll, a 24/7 mental health support network. Additionally, the university received a $3 million grant in 2019 to start The Shreiber Family Pet Therapy Program after their success with bringing in local therapy dogs to help students with anxiety and stress.

== Academics ==

The university is currently divided into eighteen colleges and schools.

* Rohrer College of Business
* Ric Edelman College of Communication and Creative Arts 
* College of Education
* Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering
* John H. Martinson Honors College
* College of Humanities and Social Sciences
* College of Performing Arts
* College of Science and Mathematics
* School of Earth and Environment
* Global Learning and Partnerships
* Cooper Medical School of Rowan University

** Rowan-Virtua School of Osteopathic Medicine
*** Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences
** Rowan-Virtua School of Translational Biomedical Engineering &amp; Sciences
* Rowan University School of Veterinary Medicine
* School of Innovation and Entrepreneurship

=== Admissions and enrollment ===
Enrollment at Rowan from the fall semester of 2017 shows 15,401 undergraduates and 2,045 graduate students from 38 states and 34 countries. The overall admission rate is 53.0%. Undergraduates submitting statistics for a data set in 2017 had scores of 530 at the 25th percentile and 630 at the 75th percentile in SAT critical reading and 510 at the 25th percentile and 620 at the 75th percentile for SAT Math. As of the fall of 2016, the average accepted GPA was 3.46.

== Student life ==

=== Student Center ===
The Chamberlain Student Center is the main location for dining on campus. Dining options include the Owl&#x27;s Nest restaurant, Peet&#x27;s Coffee, Grill Nation, Jersey Mike&#x27;s Subs, Freshens, Sono, Crust, Chef Jet, Smoked, Breakfast &amp; Co., Bowl Life, Pop Up, and the Marketplace convenience store. The Student Center is also home to the Student Government Association, Conference and Event Services, the Greek Affairs Office, Student Activities, the Mailroom, and the Information Desk.

=== Media ===

Rowan University hosts the award-winning Rowan Radio 89.7 WGLS-FM, which began in 1964 on a $6,000 budget (). Additionally, the Rowan Television Network (RTN) is a student-run closed-circuit television station that provides 24-hour content to the students of Rowan University. RTN currently consists of 11 student-produced television shows, various sports related programming, and coverage of topical events occurring on campus.

&quot;The Whit&quot; has served as the campus newspaper since 1938, covering school news, student life, Rowan sports, and entertainment. It is published weekly throughout the school year except during exams. Another mainstay campus publication is &quot;Avant&quot;, a student-led literary magazine that compiles undergraduate poetry, short stories, photos, and artwork in annual fall and spring issues. &quot;Image&quot; is the annual Rowan yearbook. Other campus publications include &quot;Halftone&quot;, an online magazine focusing on entertainment and pop culture, and &quot;At My Whit&#x27;s End&quot;, a zine published by the Writing Arts Club. &quot;Venue&quot; was a long-running alternative, uncensored student publication focusing on campus opinions and humor, initially formed in 1968 with a heavy political focus. Changing its format over the years, &quot;Venue&quot; printed four issues a year up to 2011.

=== Rowan Boulevard ===
Rowan Boulevard connects 322 to downtown Glassboro, forming a bustling urban area that fuses businesses, bookstores, restaurants, a primary care facility, academic buildings, and student housing.

=== Housing ===
Rowan provides housing for over 6,500 students in 13 University owned housing complexes and 5 affiliated housing units. Students have a choice between halls, apartments, or townhouses. Full-time, non-commuter students are required to live in on-campus until the completion of their sophomore year, and are thus guaranteed on-campus housing during this time. After this, students must enter into a housing lottery.

With the university&#x27;s continued growth, housing at Rowan&#x27;s main Glassboro campus has reached capacity. The university has moved to construct new housing aggressively.

The student-run Residence Hall Association represents students who live on-campus.

There are seven freshman residence halls and five for upperclassmen. Starting in the fall of 2017, Rowan University offered apartment-style housing options in a public-private partnership with Nexus Properties.

=== Student organizations ===
There are more than 100 clubs and organizations at Rowan University, along with more than 30 Greek organizations.

Other chartered clubs report to the Student Government Association including the Rowan Television Network, the local PRSSA, the Rowan College Republicans, the Rowan Democratic Club, and The Student University Programmers (SUP). Cinema Workshop, the university&#x27;s student film club, celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007.

== Transportation ==

New Jersey Transit bus routes 313 and 412 serve the university. U.S. Route 322 (Mullica Hill Road) bisects the campus. It is a planned stop on the Glassboro–Camden Line, a proposed diesel multiple unit (DMU) light rail system.

<text>John Erskine (October 5, 1879 – June 2, 1951) was an American educator and author, pianist and composer. He was an English professor at Amherst College from 1903 to 1909, followed by Columbia University from 1909 to 1937. He was the first president of the Juilliard School of Music. During his tenure at Columbia University he formulated the General Honors Course—responsible for inspiring the influential Great Books movement. He published over 100 books, novels, criticism, and essays including the essay &quot;The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent&quot; (1915).

==Early life and education==
Erskine was born in New York City, New York, the son of Eliza Jane (née Hollingsworth) and James Morrison Erskine. and raised in Weehawken, New Jersey. He graduated from Columbia University, B.A., 1900, M.A. 1901 and Ph.D., 1903 and D.Litt. 1929, besides D.Litt. degree from Amherst in 1923.

==Career==
Erskine was English professor at Amherst College from 1903 to 1909, and subsequently taught at Columbia University from 1909 to 1937. In 1910, he led foundation of the Boar&#x27;s Head Society for literature. In 1920, he instituted Columbia College&#x27;s General Honors Course, a two-year undergraduate seminar that would later help inspire &quot;Masterworks of Western Literature&quot;, now known commonly as &quot;Literature Humanities&quot;, the second component of Columbia College&#x27;s Core Curriculum. This course taught the classics in translation instead of the original Latin or Greek, a concept he elaborated in his noted essay &quot;The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent&quot;. He found little support for the course from the senior faculty, and junior faculty members like Mark Van Doren and later after 1923, Mortimer Adler took up sections of the course. This course would later go on to inspire the Great Books movement, centered on the Great Books of the Western World. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. In 1929, Adler left Columbia to join University of Chicago, where he continued to work on the theme with Robert Hutchins, president of the university. Together they subsequently went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation.

Erskine co-wrote the 1900 Varsity Show at Columbia, writing the musical score for &quot;The Governor&#x27;s Vrouw&quot; (1900), a two-act comic opera by Henry Sydnor Harrison and poet Melville Cane, who also wrote the lyrics. He won the Butler Medal in 1919. During his career Erskine published over 100 books, though as a writer he first received acclaim with his novel &quot;The Private Life of Helen of Troy&quot; (1925). This novel was made into a silent film by the same the name in 1927, directed by Alexander Korda. Other films based on his works included &quot;A Lady Surrenders&quot; (1930) by John M. Stahl, &quot;Bachelor of Arts&quot; (1934) by Louis King and &quot;The President&#x27;s Mystery&quot; (1936) directed by Phil Rosen. The 1956 biopic of French noblewoman Diane de Poitiers entitled &quot;Diane&quot; was based on his story with a screenplay by Christopher Isherwood. He was also the author of numerous publications, including several humorous novels retelling myths and legends, besides essays, criticism, and two volumes of autobiography. These included &quot;Penelope&#x27;s Man&quot; and &quot;Adam and Eve, Though He Knew Better&quot;.

Erskine was also an accomplished composer, pianist and musician. He wrote several books of music and the libretto for George Antheil&#x27;s opera &quot;Helen Retires&quot; (1931), which was based on &quot;The Private Life of Helen of Troy&quot;. He was the first president of the Juilliard School of Music from 1928 to 1937. He was also director of the Metropolitan Opera Association, which runs the Metropolitan Opera, a noted opera company based in New York City.

Erskine is also credited with writing the subtitles for a number of films, including Sacha Guitry&#x27;s &quot;Le Roman d&#x27;un tricheur&quot; (The Story of a Cheat) in 1938, Marcel Pagnol&#x27;s &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Wife&quot; in 1940 and Mario Camerini&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit and the Flesh&quot;, an adaptation of Alessandro Manzoni&#x27;s classic novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot;, in 1948.

To commemorate the seven hundredth anniversary of Roger Bacon, Erskine wrote &quot;A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century,&quot; a biographical play which was produced at Columbia University and published as a book by Columbia University Press in 1914. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a collection of his papers. In 1946 he served as the first chairman of the American Writers Association.

==Personal life==
He was married twice, to Pauline Ives (m. 1910–1945) and Helen Worden Erskine (m. 1946–1951). With his wife Pauline (Ives), he was the grandfather of actress Lindsay Crouse and the great-grandfather of actress Zosia Mamet. He died on June 2, 1951, in New York at the age of 71.
Erskine Place, a street in Co-op City in the New York City borough of The Bronx, was named after him.

<doc id="859486" wikidata="Q1276385" url="?curid=859486" title="Geniocracy">
<text>Geniocracy is the framework for a system of government which was first proposed by Raël (leader of the International Raëlian Movement) in 1977 and which advocates a certain minimal criterion of intelligence for political candidates and also the electorate.

==Definition==
The term &quot;geniocracy&quot; comes from the word &quot;genius&quot;, and describes a system that is designed to select for intelligence and compassion as the primary factors for governance. While having a democratic electoral apparatus, it differs from traditional liberal democracy by instead suggesting that candidates for office and the body electorate should meet a certain minimal criterion of problem-solving or creative intelligence. The thresholds proposed by the Raëlians are 50% above the mean for an electoral candidate and 10% above the mean for an elector. Notably, if the distribution of intelligence is assumed to be symmetric (as it is for the IQ), this would imply that the majority of population has no right to vote.

===Justifying the method of selection===
This method of selectivity is deliberate so as to address what the concept considers to be flaws in the current systems of democracy. The primary object of criticism is the inability of majoritarian consensus to provide a reasonable platform for intelligent decision-making for the purpose of solving problems permanently. Geniocracy&#x27;s criticism of this system is that the institutions of democracy become more concerned with appealing to popular consensus through emotive issues than they are in making long-term critical decisions, especially those that may involve issues that are not immediately relevant to the electorate. It asserts that political mandate is something that is far too important to simply leave to popularity, and asserts that the critical decision-making that is required for government, especially in a world of globalization, cannot be based upon criteria of emotive or popular decision-making. In this respect, geniocracy derides liberal democracy as a form of &quot;mediocracy&quot;. In a geniocracy, Earth would be ruled by a worldwide geniocratic government.

==Agenda==
Part of the geniocratic agenda is to promote the idea of a world government system, deriding the current state-system as inadequate for dealing with contemporary global issues that are typical of globalisation, such as environmentalism, social justice, human rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, geniocracy proposes a different economic model (where it is given a name called &quot;Humanitarianism&quot; in the book Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers).

===Response to criticism===
As a response to its controversial attitudes about selectivity, one of the more general responses is to point out that universal suffrage, the current system, already discriminates to some degree and varyingly in different countries as to who is allowed to vote. Primarily, this discrimination is against women, minority racial groups, refugees, immigrants, minority religious groups, minority ethnic groups, minors, elderly people, those living in poverty and homelessness, incarcerated and previously incarcerated people, and the mentally or physically incapacitated. This is on the basis that their ability to contribute to the decision-making process is either flawed or invalid for the purpose of the society.

===Status===
The current difficulty in the ideas of geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. One idea offered by Raël in &quot;Geniocracy&quot; is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing tests that would define each person&#x27;s level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.

Some argue other components deemed necessary for a more rounded understanding of intelligence include concepts like emotional intelligence. As such, geniocracy&#x27;s validity cannot really be assessed until better and more objective methods of intelligence assessment are made available.

The matter of confronting moral problems that may arise is not addressed in the book &quot;Geniocracy&quot;; many leaders may be deeply intelligent and charismatic (having both high emotional/social intelligence and IQ) according to current means of measuring such factors, but no current scientific tests are a reliable enough measure for one&#x27;s ability to make humanitarian choices (although online tests such as those used by retail chains to select job applicants may be relevant).

The lack of scientific rigour necessary for inclusion of geniocracy as properly testable political ideology can be noted in number of modern and historical dictatorships as well as oligarchies. Because of the controversies surrounding geniocracy, Raël presents the idea as a classic utopia or provocative ideal and not necessarily a model that humanity will follow.

===Democratically defined regions===
The author of &quot;Geniocracy&quot; recommends (though does not necessitate) a world government with 12 regions. Inhabitants would vote for which region they want to be part of. After the regions are defined, they are further divided into 12 sectors after the same principle of democracy is applied. While sectors of the same region are defined as having equal numbers of inhabitants, the regions themselves may have different levels of population, which would be proportional to its voting power.

<text>The Prince Kūhiō Federal Building, formally the Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaole Federal Building and United States Courthouse, is the official seat of the United States federal government and its local branches of various agencies and departments in the state of Hawaii. Its address is 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850.

The building was completed in 1977 with a total of of working space.
It houses the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, the United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Honolulu Division), the offices of Hawaii&#x27;s U.S. Senators, the offices of Hawaii&#x27;s U.S. Representatives for Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district and Hawaii&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, and branch offices of the United States Secret Service, United States Probation and Pretrial Services System, Department of Homeland Security, United States Department of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, among other entities.

The building was named after Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, heir to the throne of the overthrown Kingdom of Hawaii, who served as Republican territorial delegate to the United States Congress from 1903 through 1922.
It was built on part of the former US Army Fort Armstrong, which was named for Samuel C. Armstrong (1839–1893), son of Hawaiian missionaries.
Across Ala Moana Boulevard is the Aloha Tower at the Honolulu harbor. Other parts of Fort Armstrong became a container terminal for military supplies.

The Prince Kūhiō Building was constructed to replace the aging Federal Court, Customs House and Post Office building fronting ʻIolani Palace and adjacent to Aliiōlani Hale which had been built in 1922 and expanded in 1931. After being mostly vacant, the old building was renovated and put up for sale. The old building was given back to the state of Hawaii and was renamed the King David Kalākaua Building in December 2003.

Construction of the Prince Kūhiō Federal Building was not without controversy. The General Services Administration wanted a simple tall office tower, while local architects argued for a building more appropriate to Hawaii.
Statutes provided that all buildings between the shoreline and the foot of Punchbowl Crater could not be taller than the Hawaii State Capitol. The federal government, not legally limited by local statutes, defied the statutes and constructed the building as the tallest structure in the path of the capitol building&#x27;s view of the shoreline. The complex includes ten stories of offices (including a penthouse level), connected by an enclosed bridge to a six-story courthouse building (including basement).

The Prince Kūhiō Federal Building was designed by Joseph G.F. Farrell&#x27;s firm Architects Hawaii. Other government buildings designed by the firm include the capitol building of Palau, which opened in 2006.
The building was selected for $121 million of renovations as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The plan is to make the building more efficient by upgrading its mechanical, electrical, fire-safety, and plumbing systems.
It had already been cited as an efficient building by the Energy Star program.
Traces of asbestos were discovered during the first phase.
The second phase of construction was approved in March 2011.

<text>Decatur Island is one of the San Juan Islands in Washington state, USA. Located just east of Lopez Island across Lopez Sound and just south of Blakely Island across Thatcher Pass, it is 3.524 square miles (9.127 km²) in area, and was named by the Wilkes Expedition in 1841 for naval officer Stephen Decatur.

==History==
A post office called Decatur was established in 1891, and remained in operation until 1969.

There is a one-room school for kindergarten through eighth grade. The 2000 census reported a resident population of 71 persons.

==Parks and recreation==
There is a private nine-hole rustic golf course, Memorial Day to Labor Day there is a farmer&#x27;s market each Saturday at the country store. James Island State Park is just to the east of the island.

==Infrastructure==
There are no public facilities other than one public boat ramp in Davis Bay on the east side of the island. The San Juan Preservation Trust allows public day-use of their property on the southern tip of the island.

There is no Washington State Ferry service to Decatur; access is by private boat or plane. The airport on Decatur Island is private, for residents of the Decatur Shores community only. All other persons wishing to use the airport must obtain prior permission from the community. Paraclete Charter Service and Island Express Charters provide passenger-only ferry service to Decatur from Anacortes. Northwest Sky Ferry provides air service from Bellingham, Washington. Island Transport operates a ferry/barge, transporting cargo and vehicles from Skyline Marina in Anacortes to the public boat ramp.

<doc id="859508" wikidata="Q7325248" url="?curid=859508" title="Richard Dortch">
<text>Richard W. Dortch (October 15, 1931 – June 15, 2011) was an Assemblies of God District Superintendent for Illinois (1970–83) and an Assemblies of God Executive Presbyter (1971–1985). Born in Granite City, Illinois, Dortch served as a pastor early in his ministerial career, and was also a missionary to Belgium (1959–1964), where he helped found and lead Emmanuel Bible Institute in Andrimont.

== Early life and education ==
Dortch&#x27;s early life was marked by a strong religious upbringing. He felt called to ministry at a young age and pursued theological education at Central Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, graduating in 1953.

== Pastoral career ==
While pastoring in Alton, Illinois, in 1967, Dortch was elected as secretary-treasurer for the Illinois district of the Assemblies of God and served until 1970. He then was elected to serve as Illinois District Superintendent, a position that he held until he resigned in 1983 to work at PTL.

== Role at PTL ==
He became Executive Vice President of the PTL Christian evangelical television network in 1983, a network typically featuring speakers affiliated with the Pentecostal movement. During his time at PTL, Dortch worked closely with Jim Bakker, the founder of the ministry. He was responsible for overseeing much of the day-to-day operations of the organization, including its finances and programming.

The PTL (Praise The Lord) ministry experienced rapid growth under Bakker and Dortch&#x27;s leadership, expanding its reach through television broadcasts and the development of Heritage USA, a Christian theme park and residential complex in South Carolina.

== Legal troubles ==
In 1988 he, along with other executives of PTL, was indicted on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy. In a plea bargain, Dortch pleaded guilty to reduced charges and was sentenced to eight years in prison, later cut to two and a half years. The charges stemmed from the misuse of ministry funds and deceptive fundraising practices. Dortch admitted to his role in covering up hush money payments to Jessica Hahn, a church secretary who had accused Jim Bakker of sexual assault.

== Restoration and later life ==
His ministry credentials were restored by the Assemblies of God in 1991. This restoration came after Dortch demonstrated genuine repentance and a commitment to ethical ministry practices. The decision to reinstate him was not without controversy within the Assemblies of God community.

Dortch wrote several books about personal integrity and restoration. His most notable works include &quot;Integrity: How I Lost It, and My Journey Back&quot; (1991) and &quot;Fatal Conceit&quot; (2012, published posthumously). These books detailed his experiences with the PTL scandal and his subsequent journey of redemption.

Until just prior to his death he hosted a long-standing two- to three-hours prayer service called &quot;America&#x27;s Prayer Meeting&quot; on the Christian Television Network. This program became a platform for Dortch to share his message of redemption and the importance of ethical leadership in ministry.

== Death and legacy ==
Dortch passed away on June 15, 2011, in Palm Harbor, Florida. Despite the controversies that marked his career, he was remembered by many in the Christian community as a man who had faced his mistakes and dedicated his later years to promoting integrity in ministry.

<text>Meridian or Tangletown is the part of Seattle&#x27;s Wallingford neighborhood that lies north of N 50th Street, near Green Lake. Of note are its &quot;K streets&quot;: Kensington, Kenwood, Keystone, and Kirkwood Places N.

The concentration of mostly retail businesses on N 55th Street near Meridian Avenue is known variously as Tangletown or Meridian and considered by some to be more closely associated with Greenlake than Wallingford. The likely source for the name Tangletown is the irregular configuration of Seattle&#x27;s street grid in this transition zone, where Wallingford shades into the Green Lake neighborhood, some of which follow the contours of Green Lake, others conforming to the city&#x27;s basic grid. An alternative explanation is that the neighborhood was given the name Tangletown years ago, when a streetcar interchange occupied the space where businesses and condominiums now stand.

Meridian sometimes refers to a wider neighborhood than Tangletown, which refers strictly to the retail district. The name Meridian came from the Meridian Line, a streetcar line. The name became popular when it was used by brothers Stan and Milton Stapp who published the local newspaper, the North Central Outlook. They used the term to differentiate the area from the nearby neighborhoods of Greenlake and Wallingford.

One of the neighborhood&#x27;s principal landmarks The Keystone Building, built in 1910 by D.J. Orner &amp; Son (see image below) has been the home of various businesses over the years. In 1938, the building housed the Barclay&#x27;s Grocery, Kenwood Market and Sires Brother&#x27;s Paint Company. From 1956 it became the longstanding Lamont&#x27;s Food Center until the 1980s when it was converted to the Honey Bear Bakery, while the East side of the building became the M&amp;R Grocer. Today the West corner of the building is home to the TangleTown Public House (the old Honeybear bakery) while the East side is now the Mighty-O Donuts headquarters.

The neighborhood is bounded on the south by N 50th Street, beyond which is the rest of Wallingford; on the west by Green Lake Way N., beyond which is Woodland Park and Phinney Ridge; on the north by N 60th Street, beyond which is the Green Lake neighborhood, and on the east by Interstate 5, beyond which is the University District. Its main thoroughfares are Meridian Avenue N, Kirkwood Place N, and Latona Avenue NE (north- and southbound) and NE 56th Street (east- and westbound).

<text>The King David Kalakaua Building in Honolulu, Hawaii is a government building formerly known as the U.S. Post Office, Customhouse, and Courthouse. It was the official seat of administration in the Territory of Hawaii and state of Hawaii for the United States federal government.

==Federal building==
The building was designed in 1918 and built from 1921 to 1922 in Mission/Spanish Revival architecture. An addition to the building was started in 1929, and opened in 1931.
Among other functions, the building held courtrooms and offices for the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on January 27, 1975, under the former name as site 75000620. In 1978 it was also included as a contributing property in the NRHP listing of the Hawaii Capital Historic District.

==State building==
In December 2003, the federal government sold most of the building to the state of Hawaii for US$32.5 million, upon which the building was renamed in honor of King David Kalākaua — last king of the Hawaiian monarchy. By that point in time, all federal agencies and departments had already moved their Hawaii-based offices years earlier to the Prince Kuhio Federal Building near Honolulu Harbor, except for a small section of the building that is still used as a post office.

Today, the building is home to the offices of the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs.

<text>William Frend De Morgan (16 November 1839 – 15 January 1917) was an English potter, tile designer and novelist. A lifelong friend of William Morris, he designed tiles, stained glass and furniture for Morris &amp; Co. from 1863 to 1872. His tiles often recall medieval or Islamic design patterns. He applied innovative glazes and firing techniques. Galleons and fish were common motifs, as were &quot;fantastical&quot; birds and animals. Many of De Morgan&#x27;s tiles were designed to create intricate patterns when several were laid together.

==Life and work==
Born in Gower Street, London, the son of the distinguished mathematician Augustus De Morgan and his highly educated wife Sophia Elizabeth Frend, De Morgan was supported in his desire to become an artist. At the age of twenty, he entered the Royal Academy schools, but he was swiftly disillusioned with the establishment. Then he met Morris and through him the Pre-Raphaelite circle. Soon De Morgan began experimenting with stained glass, ventured into pottery in 1863, and by 1872 had shifted his interest wholly to ceramics, initially working in Fitzroy Square. 

In 1872, De Morgan set up a pottery in Chelsea, where he stayed until 1881—his most fruitful decade as an art potter. The arts and crafts ideology he was exposed to through his friendship with Morris and his insistent curiosity led De Morgan to begin to explore every technical aspect of his craft. His early efforts at making his own tiles during his Chelsea Period were of variable technical quality—often amateurish with firing defects and irregularities. In his early years, De Morgan made extensive use of blank commercial tiles. Hard and durable biscuit tiles of red clay were obtained from the Patent Architectural Pottery Co. in Poole. Dust pressed tiles of white earthenware were bought from Wedgwood, Mintons and other manufacturers but De Morgan believed these would not stand frost. He continued to use blank commercial dust-pressed tiles which were decorated in red lustre into his Fulham Period (1888–1907). However, he developed a high-quality biscuit tile of his own, which he admired for its irregularities and better resistance to moisture. His inventive streak led him to spend hours designing a duplex bicycle gear and lured him into complex studies of the chemistry of glazes, methods of firing, and pattern transfer.

Between 1882 and 1900, De Morgan was commissioned by T. E. Collcutt to produce tile panels for the public rooms of 12 P&amp;O liners. This followed an earlier commission in 1880, to produce similar panels for the Tsar&#x27;s yacht, &quot;Livadia&quot;.

De Morgan&#x27;s decoration of pottery included chargers, rice dishes and vases. Some of these were made in his works, but many were bought as biscuit ware from Wedgwood and others and decorated by De Morgan&#x27;s workers. Some were signed by his decorators including Charles Passenger, Fred Passenger, Joe Juster and Miss Babb.


De Morgan was particularly drawn to Eastern tiles. Around 1873–1874, he made a striking breakthrough by rediscovering the technique of lustreware (marked by a reflective, metallic surface) found in Hispano-Moresque pottery and Italian maiolica. Nor was his interest in the East limited to glazing techniques, but it permeated his notions of design and colour as well. As early as 1875, he began to work in earnest with a &quot;Persian&quot; palette: dark blue, turquoise, manganese purple, green, Indian red, and lemon yellow. Study of the motifs of what he referred to as &quot;Persian&quot; ware (and what we know today as 15th and 16th-century İznik ware), profoundly influenced his unmistakable style, in which fantastic creatures entwined with rhythmic geometric motifs float under luminous glazes.

The pottery works was beset by financial problems, despite repeated cash injections from his wife, the pre-Raphaelite painter Evelyn De Morgan (née Pickering), and a partnership with the architect Halsey Ricardo. This partnership was associated with a move for the factory from Merton Abbey to Fulham in 1888. During the Fulham period De Morgan mastered many of the technical aspects of his work that had previously been elusive, including complex lustres and deep, intense underglaze painting that did not run during firing. However, this did not guarantee financial success, and in 1907 De Morgan left the pottery, which continued under the Passenger brothers, the leading painters at the works. &quot;All my life I have been trying to make beautiful things&quot;, he said at the time, &quot;and now that I can make them nobody wants them.&quot;

De Morgan turned his hand to writing novels, and became better known than he ever had been for his pottery. His first novel, &quot;Joseph Vance&quot;, was published in 1906, and was an instant sensation in the United States as well as the United Kingdom. This was followed by &quot;An Affair of Dishonour&quot;, &quot;Alice-for-Short&quot;, and the two-volume &quot;It Never Can Happen Again&quot; (1909). The genre has been described as &quot;Victorian and suburban&quot;.

De Morgan died of trench fever in London in 1917, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery. Recollections praise him for his personal warmth and the indomitable energy with which he pursued his kaleidoscopic career as designer, potter, inventor and novelist.

==Museums and collections==

Collections of De Morgan&#x27;s work exist in many museums, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the William Morris Gallery in London, a substantial and representative collection in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, and a small but well-chosen collection along with much other pottery at Norwich. There was an exhibition of his work and of that of his wife, Evelyn, at the De Morgan Centre in Wandsworth, London (part of Wandsworth Museum) from 2002 until 2014. His &quot;Dragon Charger&quot; is in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery in New Zealand. The National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa has a good collection of William De Morgan&#x27;s work given by Ruth Amelia Jackson in 1997 but much of it is kept in store. De Morgan&#x27;s work is also present in many major collections with decorative art including the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Canada, the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris, Manchester Art Gallery and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

A number of properties in the UK open to the public have tiles and pottery on display or incorporated in the building&#x27;s decoration. They include Wightwick Manor (the National Trust, Wolverhampton), Standen (the National Trust, East Grinstead), Blackwell (Lakeland Arts Trust, Windermere), Leicester Secular Hall and Leighton House (London Borough of Kensington). His ceramics, papers and artworks by both de Morgans, were collected by his sister-in-law after his death. These are now the collection of the De Morgan Foundation. Long-term loans of these artworks can be seen at Cannon Hall at Cawthorne in Barnsley, with a selection of both William&#x27;s and Evelyn&#x27;s work on display in the exhibition &#x27;A Family of Artists&#x27;, and at Watts Gallery in Surrey and in the De Morgan Collection exhibition in the Malthouse Gallery at Wightwick Manor, a National Trust Arts &amp; Crafts house in Wolverhampton. A selection of ceramics from the De Morgan Collection is on long-term loan to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. There are also other, temporary exhibitions from the collection from time to time.

<text>The IBM 519 Document-Originating Machine, introduced in 1946, was the last in a series of unit record machines designed for automated preparation of punched cards. Others in the series included the IBM 513 &amp; IBM 514 Reproducing Punch.

The 519, which was &quot;state of the art for the time&quot;,
could:
* reproduce all or parts of the information on a set of cards
* &quot;gangpunch&quot; - copy information from a master card into the following detail cards
* print up to eight digits on the end of a card
* compare two decks of cards
* &quot;summary punch&quot; — create punch cards containing summary information provided by a connected accounting machine, such as totals from a group of processed cards
* &quot;mark sense&quot; — detect marks made with an electrographic pencil in designated locations on a punched card and then punch holes corresponding to those marks into the card
* number cards consecutively (an optional feature)

The reproducing, gangpunching, summary punching, and comparing features of the IBM 519 are very similar to those of the IBM 513 and IBM 514.

==IBM 513 Reproducing Punch==
The IBM 513 Reproducing Punch, like the IBM 514, had some - but not all - of the capabilities included in the IBM 519. This model was released circa 1933.

==IBM 514 Reproducing Punch==

The IBM 514 Reproducing Punch was introduced in February 1949. Like the 513, it had fewer capabilities than the IBM 519. The 514 was withdrawn in 1978.

The identifier &quot;IBM 514&quot; has been partially recycled in the form of &quot;IBM 514 Watt(s) Hot-Swap Power Supply.&quot;

===Capabilities table===

The IBM 513, 514 and 519 all operated at 100 cards per minute, and their operations were directed by a removable control panel that was known as a plugboard. As with other IBM punched card devices that operated as automatic punches, cards are fed &quot;face down, 12-edge first.&quot;. (On devices that operated as automatic readers, cards were fed &quot;face down, 9-edge first instead.)

==History==
Production of the IBM 519 was still going strong in 1956/1957, and production was consolidated to Rochester (for the Americas) and Milan, Italy. IBM closed its last punched card manufacturing plant in 1984, nearly a century after Herman Hollerith&#x27;s 1886 construction of the first card sorting machine.

<text>The Air and Space Expeditionary Service Ribbon (AFESR) is a military award of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force which was first created in June 2003 as the Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon. The ribbon is awarded to any member of the Air Force or Space Force who completes a standard contingency deployment. On 16 November 2020, the Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon was renamed to the Air and Space Expeditionary Service Ribbon by the Secretary of the Air Force.

The regulations of the Air and Space Expeditionary Service Ribbon define a deployment as either forty-five consecutive days or ninety non-consecutive days in a deployed status. Temporary duty orders also qualify towards the ninety-day time requirement. For deployments exceeding 45–90 days, a single Air and Space Expeditionary Service Ribbon will be awarded for the entire time frame rather than issuing multiple awards for the same period of deployed service.

==Gold frame==
Similar to the US Army&#x27;s Combat Service Identification Badge (CSIB), for those service members who serve in designated combat zones and participate in combat operations, a gold frame, which the Air Force and Space Force refers to as a gold border, may be attached to the ASESR basic ribbon. However, it can also be awarded to those who serve in areas where the service member receives hostile fire pay and supports combat operations. The gold border is issued as a one-time award only, regardless of the number of combat operations in which a service member serves.

The Air and Space Expeditionary Service Ribbon with gold border may also be awarded to certain &quot;over-the horizon&quot; combat assignments, such as remotely piloted vehicle and space operators for employing a long-range weapon into a combat zone. It is therefore possible to earn the gold border geographically separated from the battlefield by thousands of miles. Such personnel, however, must have first earned the Air and Space Expeditionary Service Ribbon before the ribbon can be upgraded with a gold border.

Additional awards of the Air and Space Expeditionary Service Ribbon are denoted by oak leaf clusters and the award is retroactive to October 1, 1999.

==Symbolism==
The center stripe is light blue and stands for Air Force and Space Force capability. From this center stripe outward on each side, the narrow white stripe stands for integrity; ultramarine blue represents worldwide deployment; Department of the Air Force yellow stands for excellence, and the last two stripes (scarlet and blue) stand for the United States.

<doc id="859532" wikidata="Q538272" url="?curid=859532" title="Liberal Party of Honduras">
<text>The Liberal Party of Honduras (Spanish: &quot;Partido Liberal de Honduras)&quot; is a centrist liberal political party in Honduras that was founded in 1891. It is the oldest extant political party in the country; further, it is one of the two main parties that have, until recently, dominated Honduran politics. The party is a member of the Liberal International. The PLH is identified with the colours red and white, as the flag Francisco Morazán used in most of his military campaigns during time of the Central American Federal Republic.

The party is against the legalisation of abortion, which is punishable by imprisonment in Honduras.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The Liberal Party emerged from the political and economic rivalries that dominated Honduras during the 19th century. The country’s liberal and conservative factions were less ideologically distinct than their labels suggest; instead, they were vehicles for elites competing for control over limited state resources. Early Honduran elections were marked by frequent outbreaks of violence, with defeated factions often resorting to armed conflict. These struggles hindered economic development, as governmental resources were frequently diverted to fund military campaigns and settle wartime debts​. 
By the early 20th century, the Liberal Party had become firmly entrenched as one of the two main political parties, alongside the newly formed National Party of Honduras, a splinter group created by dissatisfied PLH members. The bipartite political system took shape during this period, with both parties backed by foreign interests, particularly the powerful American-owned banana companies that dominated the Honduran economy. While these companies initially supported both parties, a merger in 1929 resulted in the PNH securing a greater share of their financial backing, giving the PNH an advantage during this critical period​.

=== The Cariato Regime (1932–1949) ===
The rise of General Tiburcio Carías Andino and his establishment of a civilian dictatorship, colloquially referred to as the &quot;Cariato,&quot; marked a significant setback for democratic politics in Honduras. Carías, a member of the PNH, ruled with an iron grip from 1932 to 1949, suppressing political opposition and stifling the PLH. Many Liberal leaders were forced into exile, but despite this, the party survived.

=== Post-Cariato and the return to power (1949–1963) ===

When the “Cariato” ended, the PLH returned to the electoral arena with an ascendant liberal faction. The PLH won at the 1954 Honduran general election, but a political deadlock resulted in a crisis culminating in a coup. The Liberal presidential candidate and winner of the 1954 elections, Ramón Villeda Morales, was finally made president in 1957, but his administration ended prematurely due to the 1963 Honduran coup d&#x27;état.

=== Military dictatorship (1963–1982) ===
Military supremacy over politics was consolidated after the 1963 coup, and military officers occupied the presidency save for the brief civilian administration of Ramón Ernesto Cruz Uclés of the PNH, during 1971–1972. Despite the military dictatorship, the Liberal party or its leaders were not outright banned. The party, along with the National Party and the United States began putting pressure on the military to begin a transition back to civilian administration, which was finally realized in 1982.

=== 2005 elections ===
The PLH won the closely contested 2005 presidential race, but the PNH has a majority in the National Congress due to an alliance with the Christian Democrats &quot;(Democracia Cristiana).&quot;

In the general election of 27 November 2005, the party won 62 out of 128 seats in the National Congress; and its presidential candidate, Manuel Zelaya, polled 49.9% to defeat the PNH&#x27;s Porfirio Pepe Lobo, restoring the PLH as the presidential party. He was inaugurated on 27 January 2006.

Elected as a liberal, Zelaya shifted dramatically to the political left and socialism during his presidency, forging an alliance with the Hugo Chávez-linked ALBA, angering conservatives and his own Liberal Party. He was deposed by a coup d&#x27;état in 2009 and replaced by Roberto Micheletti, also of the Liberal Party.

=== 2009 elections ===
At the 2009 elections, which took place after the 2009 Honduran coup d&#x27;état that removed Manuel Zelaya from power, the Liberal Party suffered a heavy defeat by the National Party, with the Nationals&#x27; candidate for president, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, winning the presidency with (according to the Electoral Tribunal) over 1,212,846 votes and 56.56% of the national total of valid votes (in all participation as acknowledged by the tribunal was of 41%) compared with 816,874 votes and 38.1% of the national total for Liberal candidate Elvin Santos. In the elections for the National Congress of Honduras the Liberal Party won a total of 45 seats, dropping from its previous 61. The elections were held under a tense political atmosphere without the accustomed OAS observers and under a decree restricting civil rights with the elected president Zelaya under military siege in the Brazilian embassy at Tegucigalpa. Sectors opposed to the 2009 coup claim the participation was much less than reported by the authorities, but this claim has not been verified.

In 2011, Zelaya&#x27;s supporters left the Liberal Party and founded Liberty and Refoundation.

=== Recent activities ===
Following Zelaya&#x27;s split, the Liberal Party has seen a decline in its support, with Liberty and Refoundation becoming the National Party&#x27;s main rival. At the 2013 election, liberal candidate Mauricio Villeda got 20.3% of votes, finishing third.

The party further declined in the 2017 election; its candidate Luis Zelaya only obtained 14.74% of the vote, and again finished third. However, the party maintained its 26 seats in the parliament. The Liberal Party denounced the result as fraudulent.

The party&#x27;s popularity continued declining into the 2021 election. Its nominee for president, Yani Rosenthal, a member of the historically powerful Rosenthal family in Honduras, won only 10% of the vote. This was the worst result for the Liberal Party in any election it has participated since its founding in 1891, a sign of growing discontent among the population with the two traditional parties of Honduras.

<doc id="859534" wikidata="Q765665" url="?curid=859534" title="Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)">
<text>Autobiography is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Ashlee Simpson. Released in the United States by Geffen Records on July 20, 2004, the album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Musically, it combines elements of rock and pop. Critical reception for the album by critics was mixed. &quot;Autobiography&quot; has sold more than five million copies worldwide.

Three singles from &quot;Autobiography&quot; were released: &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;—the first and most successful single—which was a hit in several countries in mid to late 2004, as well as the follow-up singles &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;La La&quot;. MTV highlighted the process of making the album in the reality series &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;, which drew a large audience and served as an effective promotional vehicle for the album.

==Background==
Simpson described the process of writing the album&#x27;s twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album&#x27;s US release she said that &quot;My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it.&quot; The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album&#x27;s lyrical content was inspired by Simpson&#x27;s breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has described the album as being &quot;very honest&quot; and &quot;very true to my emotions&quot;—&quot;I wasn&#x27;t afraid to say that I was hurting and how I got over it.&quot; Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album&#x27;s producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on &quot;Autobiography&quot;—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles.

The album incorporates rock as well as pop elements, which contrasts with the heavily pop-oriented music of sister, Jessica. One reviewer noted that, unlike Jessica&#x27;s music, &quot;Autobiography&quot; &quot;relies on glitzy guitars and big power-pop riffs&quot;. On her reality show, Simpson emphasized that she did not want to make her music like pop singers such as her sister or Hilary Duff; instead, she has cited musicians such as Chrissie Hynde and Joan Jett as influences.

In a 2004 interview, Simpson said that when she began seeking a recording contract record labels would not meet with her because they thought she just wanted &quot;to be like her sister&quot;. Simpson also said that she did not want to meet with Jessica&#x27;s record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: &quot;...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always done and what I&#x27;ve always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot.&quot; Simpson said of making the album: &quot;It&#x27;s a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work.&quot; In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album&#x27;s liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song &quot;Harder Everyday&quot;, which was released as an international bonus track.

==Composition==
The title track, which was also the theme song to her MTV reality series &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;, opens the album by introducing Simpson, who sings &quot;got stains on my t-shirt, and I&#x27;m the biggest flirt&quot; and &quot;if you want my auto, want my autobiography / baby, just ask me&quot;. The &quot;Village Voice&quot; review described the song as &quot;wrist-pumping Joan Jett rock candy&quot;, but &quot;Stylus&quot; labelled the track &quot;an age-old trope and a boring one at that&quot;. &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, a song about the comfort and happiness Simpson found in her relationship with Ryan Cabrera, has been characterised as a soft rock ballad with &quot;stringy guitar riffs&quot;. &quot;Shadow&quot;, described by &quot;People&quot; magazine as the &quot;most personal song&quot; on the album, is a slower tune in which Simpson recounts playing a lesser role to her sister when she was younger, but eventually finding her own identity.

The album continues with &quot;La La&quot;, a song with sexual lyrics that Simpson has described as &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot;. One reviewer described &quot;La La&quot; as a &quot;punk inspired, fast beat, screaming anthem&quot;. &quot;Love Makes the World Go Round&quot;, which &quot;epinions.com&quot; described as having a &quot;Duff vibe&quot;, talks about the disappointment of an ending relationship. &quot;Better Off&quot;, which has been described as a &quot;bubbly&quot; song and as a &quot;chunk of pop/rock goodness&quot;, and &quot;Love Me For Me&quot;, which has been called &quot;Joan-Jett-esque&quot; and which Simpson has said is about &quot;self-appreciation&quot; both deal with contradictory feelings about relationships. The synth-driven &quot;Surrender&quot; follows with Simpson consenting to a breakup, with lyrics such as &quot;you make your misery my company&quot;; &quot;epinions&quot; wrote that it is on this track that Simpson sounds &quot;most loose and carefree&quot;.

&quot;Unreachable&quot; combines a piano line and vintage Chamberlin sounds with lyrics dealing with regrets about rushing into a relationship. Simpson has described &quot;Nothing New&quot; as being about her frustration with an ex-boyfriend&#x27;s &quot;dramas&quot; until she is ultimately &quot;finished with him&quot;, while &quot;Giving It All Away&quot; encourages the listener to stand on one&#x27;s own feet: &quot;hold on to your life and don&#x27;t give that away&quot;, Simpson said of the song. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Undiscovered&quot; (which Simpson has described as a favorite of hers), was written after her breakup with Josh, and is described by epinions.com as a song with &quot;haunting strings&quot; and &quot;mellow guitars&quot;; in the song, Simpson ponders what might have been in a lost pairing. Non-US pressings follow with &quot;Harder Everyday&quot;, and the United Kingdom edition adds &quot;Sorry&quot;, while the Japanese edition closes with &quot;Endless Summer&quot;. The US Wal-Mart edition of the album also included an access code to download a reduced-quality version of &quot;Sorry&quot; on the internet.

==Critical reception==
Critical reviews of &quot;Autobiography&quot; were mixed. &quot;People&quot; magazine considered it a &quot;passable debut&quot; and said that it showed Simpson was a &quot;credible talent in her own right&quot;; Allmusic called it &quot;an unexpectedly strong debut&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; compared &quot;Autobiography&quot; favorably to Courtney Love&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, referring particularly to &quot;Autobiography&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Fruit Stripe bubblegrunge guitars and insanely chewy melodies and an ear-tickling production job.&quot; It also praised Simpson&#x27;s singing, saying that she &quot;can pack so much contradictory emotion into a single line—a single word—that the music can barely contain it.&quot; According to &quot;Blender&quot;, all of the album&#x27;s songs &quot;paint in huge strokes&quot;; its review also regarded Simpson&#x27;s vocals positively. &quot;E! Online&quot; also praised Simpson&#x27;s singing and catchy tracks, saying that &quot;Ashlee Simpson still managed to piece together this collection of tracks that sound as if they were ripped right from the pages of her diary. Ashlee even makes you think twice about her semicharmed life. So, even if it doesn&#x27;t wow you, Autobiography may surprise you.&quot;

Other critics were more negative. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;mundane...with a predictable script&quot;, and at one point described Simpson&#x27;s singing as &quot;wailing in lieu of hitting notes&quot;. In its review, the BBC said that &quot;half the album ... feels self-indulgent and lacks substance&quot;, but also said that &quot;in-between the formulaic, innocuous songs are a smattering of catchy pop-rock tracks.&quot; IGN.com called it &quot;by-the-books, generic (and at times bland) pop/rock&quot;, although it did say Simpson&#x27;s vocals showed maturity and promise. A writer for &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine commented that &quot;after spending more than forty minutes with Ashlee, I feel like I don’t know her any better than I did beforehand...[and] for a record with the name &quot;Autobiography&quot;, it seems like no bigger criticism could be leveled.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Autobiography&quot; &quot;is a thoroughly calculated package, aiming for the same audience that embraces Avril Lavigne and Pink.&quot;

==Promotion==
The album and singles received considerable promotion in the US—where they sold the most copies—and other countries, and much of this focused on contrasting her with Jessica by highlighting her more rock-oriented image. This image distinction from Jessica did not mean that the two were not associated in publicity, however; the sisters appeared together in television commercials at around the time of &quot;Autobiography&quot;&#x27;s release, for Pizza Hut and Ice Breakers Liquid Ice.

A key element of Simpson&#x27;s promotion was &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;, which debuted on June 16, 2004, and ran for eight episodes, achieving high ratings for cable television. Jessica&#x27;s reality show, &quot;&quot;, had debuted in 2003 and had proved highly successful, being credited with reviving her flagging music career; reality television proved similarly effective in helping launch Simpson&#x27;s music career. It has been said that Simpson&#x27;s father and manager Joe Simpson &quot;redefined how you sell records&quot; through his use of reality television to promote his daughters. Simpson said that she initially did not want to do the reality show but that her father persuaded her to do it because it would be about the production of her album: &quot;...I thought that was kind of cool. You&#x27;re actually seeing a deeper look into how this album got made.&quot; She also thought the show, by showcasing her own personality, would help to distinguish her from Jessica.

Geoff Mayfield, &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s director of charts, pointed to a combination of factors in explaining Simpson&#x27;s success with &quot;Autobiography&quot;. He described Simpson as the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; and said: &quot;The MTV show is a huge catalyst, radio jumped all over the song, and her famous sister opened the door. If Jessica never happened, then Ashlee doesn&#x27;t get her own show and this album doesn&#x27;t happen.&quot; Zena Burns of &quot;Teen People&quot;, while noting the importance of effective promotion and Simpson&#x27;s connection to Jessica, stressed the appeal of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; in explaining her success: &quot;Ashlee has an amazing promotional machine, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have Jessica and MTV behind you, but she also came out with an insanely catchy pop single.&quot; From July 13 to July 20, the week prior to &quot;Autobiography&quot;&#x27;s release, MTV.com&#x27;s &quot;The Leak&quot; featured the album for streaming on its website. &quot;Autobiography&quot; drew 2.66 million requested streams during the time period, breaking a record previously held by Britney Spears&#x27; 2003 album &quot;In the Zone&quot;.

Simpson&#x27;s publicity suffered when the performance on the October 23–24 edition of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; went awry. According to Simpson&#x27;s publicists, her father and manager decided to use a vocal guide track because of problems she was having with her voice, beginning earlier in the day, that were caused by acid reflux. Although her first performance of the night—&quot;Pieces of Me&quot;—was successful, her second performance, which was supposed to be of &quot;Autobiography&quot; (at the time planned as her third single), went wrong: &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; mistakenly began playing, and Simpson&#x27;s recorded vocals were heard when her microphone was not near her mouth. She subsequently walked off the stage and then apologized for the error during the show&#x27;s closing. Some viewers accused Simpson of lip synching, and the incident received widespread coverage in the news. Simpson joked about the incident with a performance of &quot;Autobiography&quot; at the Radio Music Awards on October 25. Despite the low points of this period of the album&#x27;s promotion, there were also significant successes. According to a Geffen press release, her December 6 AOL Music Live performance &quot;had the biggest one-week audience ever for AOL with 1.6 million plays.&quot;

===Singles===
Before &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot; debuted, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; began picking up substantial airplay on radio, In May 2004, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article noted that radio stations were adding the song to their playlists faster than any other songs up to that point in the year. &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June and reached a peak position of number five in September. The song &quot;Shadow&quot; was the album&#x27;s second US single; it reached a peak of number 57 on the Hot 100, failing to match the success of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;.

Shortly afterward, &quot;La La&quot; replaced &quot;Autobiography&quot; as the album&#x27;s third single. It reached a chart peak at number 86 on the Hot 100, falling considerably short of the positions reached by her two previous singles. Simpson suffered further negative publicity at the halftime show for the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida on January 4, 2005, where she performed &quot;La La&quot; and was booed by the crowd. This may have represented backlash from the &quot;SNL&quot; debacle, as the Orange Bowl publicists said. &quot;Shadow&quot; was not released in Europe (although it was the second single in Australia), where &quot;La La&quot; was the second single. Shortly after the Orange Bowl incident, Simpson performed the song on several television shows in the UK in January 2005; &quot;La La&quot; debuted and peaked just outside the top ten, and sales of &quot;Autobiography&quot; also rose considerably during the same period.

==Commercial performance==
In the US, &quot;Autobiography&quot; was 2004&#x27;s biggest debut album by a female artist, and in September the RIAA gave the album a triple platinum certification. Following its July 20 release, it debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling about 398,000 copies; according to Nielsen SoundScan figures &quot;Autobiography&quot; sold a total of 2,576,945 copies from the time of its release until early January 2005, making it the ninth best-selling album of 2004.

In Canada, where the album&#x27;s release corresponded with the US, it sold about 3,000 copies in its first week (number 37 on the album chart); it rose on the chart to number eight at one point and went double platinum in February 2005. The album was released in the UK on October 4, 2004, and debuted at number 31 on the album charts. However, it returned to the top 40 in January 2005, rising substantially from number 91 to number 33 in the week ending January 24, following Simpson&#x27;s promotion of &quot;La La&quot; (the album&#x27;s second single in the UK, released on January 24). In Ireland, the album peaked at number 22 on the chart in late January, at the same time as &quot;La La&quot; was released as a single chart. The album also reached number 36 in Switzerland and number 29 in Norway. Simpson&#x27;s success in album sales with &quot;Autobiography&quot; outshines that of her sister Jessica, who despite having a singing career since 1999, failed to attain major success with record sales until she appeared on her 2003 reality television show. Geffen President Jordan Schur said of Simpson&#x27;s success: &quot;It&#x27;s unheard of in this business—even for a superstar—to sell this number of records,&quot; and emphasized her relative obscurity until not long before the album&#x27;s release. Simpson expressed surprise at the degree of her album&#x27;s success: &quot;I just hoped my album &quot;charted&quot;. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be number one in the country! It was a huge shock.&quot; In Brazil, the single &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was the theme of the soap opera &quot;America&quot; and made huge success selling about 15,000 copies of the album in the country.

<text>The National Democratic Congress (NDC), also known as the National Democratic Congress of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique, is a social democratic and centre-left political party in Grenada. It is the governing party in Grenada, having won a majority in the 2022 general elections. The party is led by current prime minister Dickon Mitchell as of October 2021.

== History ==
The party was founded in 1987 by George Brizan and Francis Alexis, as a party opposed to the New National Party government that came to power in the 1984 elections after the United States invasion of Grenada. It won the 1990 elections, with Nicholas Brathwaite becoming prime minister. It lost power to the NNP in the 1995 elections, which were held shortly after Brathwaite&#x27;s resignation. The NDC was thereafter in opposition for 13 years. It failed to win any seats in the 1999 elections, but only narrowly lost the 2003 elections, in which it won 45.6% of the popular vote and seven of the 15 seats.

In the July 2008 general election, the NDC won 11 out of 15 seats, and party leader Tillman Thomas became prime minister. Despite a 40% vote share in the 2013 election, the party lost all its seats to the New National Party under Keith Mitchell, which obtained all 15 seats.

The NDC was affiliated to the former Central American liberal organisation FELICA (the Federation of Liberal Parties of Central America and the Caribbean), also known as the . The party maintains close links with the other center-left political parties in the English-speaking Caribbean such as the Democratic Labour Party in Barbados.

<doc id="859537" wikidata="Q316161" url="?curid=859537" title="Lenny Wilkens">
<text>Leonard Randolph Wilkens (born October 28, 1937) is an American former basketball player and coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has been inducted three times into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, first in 1989 as a player, as a coach in 1998, and in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States Olympic &quot;Dream Team&quot; for which he was an assistant coach. In 1996, Wilkens was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team, and in 2021 he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In addition, in 2022 he was also named to the list of the 15 Greatest Coaches in NBA History, being the only person to be in both NBA 75th season celebration list as player and coach.

==Early life==
Leonard Randolph Wilkens was born on October 28, 1937, in Brooklyn, New York. Wilkens grew up in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. His father was African American and his mother was Irish American. Wilkens was raised in the Catholic faith.

At Boys High School, Wilkens was a basketball teammate of longtime Major League Baseball star Tommy Davis, and played for coach Mickey Fisher.

==College career==
Wilkens was a two-time All-America (1959 and 1960) at Providence College. He led the team to their first NIT appearance in 1959, and to the NIT finals in 1960. When he graduated, Wilkens was, with 1,193 points, the second-ranked scorer in Friar history (he has since dropped to 20th as of 2005). In 1996, Wilkens&#x27; No. 14 jersey was retired by the college, the first alumnus to receive such an honor. In honor of his collegiate accomplishments, Wilkens was one of the inaugural inductees into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Professional career==

===St. Louis Hawks (1960–1968)===
Wilkens was drafted sixth overall by the St. Louis Hawks in the 1960 NBA draft. He began his career with eight seasons with the St. Louis Hawks, who lost the finals to the Boston Celtics in his rookie season. The Hawks made the playoffs consistently with Wilkens but never again reached the finals. Wilkens placed second to Wilt Chamberlain in the 1967–1968 MVP balloting, his last with the Hawks.

===Seattle SuperSonics (1968–1972)===
Wilkens was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics for Walt Hazzard and spent four seasons there. He averaged 22.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game in his first season for the SuperSonics, and was an All-Star in three of his seasons for them. He was named head coach in his second season with the team. Although the SuperSonics did not reach the playoffs while Wilkens simultaneously coached and started at point guard, their record improved each season and they won 47 games during the 1971–72 NBA season. Wilkens was dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers before the start of the next season in a highly unpopular trade, and the SuperSonics fell to 26–56 without his leadership on the court.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1972–1974)===
Wilkens played two seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

===Portland Trail Blazers (1974–1975)===
Wilkens played one season with the Portland Trail Blazers.

===Legacy===
Wilkens scored 17,772 points during the regular season, was a nine-time NBA All-Star, and was named the 1971 NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1971. With Seattle, he led the league in assists in the 1969–70 season, and at the time of his retirement was the NBA&#x27;s second all-time leader in that category, behind only Oscar Robertson. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wilkens as the 75th greatest player in NBA history.

==Coaching career==
===Seattle SuperSonics (1969–1972)===
Wilkens was a player-coach for the Seattle SuperSonics from 1969 to 1972.

===Portland Trail Blazers (1974–1976)===
In his one season as a player with the Portland Trail Blazers, he was a player-coach. He retired from playing in 1975 and was the full-time coach of the Trail Blazers for one more season.

===Seattle SuperSonics (1977–1985)===
After a season off from coaching, he again became coach of the SuperSonics when he replaced Bob Hopkins who was fired 22 games into the 1977–78 season after a dismal 5–17 start. The SuperSonics won 11 of their first 12 games under Wilkens. They made the playoffs in back-to-back years, losing in seven games to the Washington Bullets in the 1978 NBA Finals before returning to the 1979 NBA Finals and defeating the Washington Bullets in five games for their only NBA title.

He coached in Seattle for eight seasons (1977–1985), winning his (and Seattle&#x27;s) only NBA championship in 1979.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1986–1993)===
Wilkens would go on to coach the Cleveland Cavaliers from 1986 to 1993. He resigned as coach following the 1992–93 season, after the Cavs were swept by the Chicago Bulls in the second round of the playoffs.

===Atlanta Hawks (1993–2000)===
On June 2, 1993, Wilkens was hired as the head coach of the Atlanta Hawks. In 1997, his contract was extended to two years and $10.4 million dollars. The team made the playoffs in Wilkens&#x27; first six seasons. However, on 24 April 2000, he resigned as head coach following a 28-54 record.

===Toronto Raptors (2000–2003)===
In June 2000, Wilkens signed a four-year, $20 million dollar contract to become head coach of the Toronto Raptors, replacing Butch Carter. In his first season at the helm, he led the Raptors franchise to their first playoff series win, defeating the New York Knicks in the first round. Wilkens and the team parted ways after a disappointing and injury riddled 2002-03 season where they finished with a 24-58 record.

===New York Knicks (2004–2005)===
The Hall of Famer was named head coach of the New York Knicks on January 15, 2004 after the team started 15-24 under Don Chaney. After the Knicks&#x27; slow start to the 2004–05 season, Wilkens resigned from the team on January 22, 2005.

==Executive career==
Wilkens was the General Manager of the Seattle SuperSonics from April 24, 1985 until May 27, 1986. During his stint as GM, he drafted future All-Star Xavier McDaniel and hired Head Coach Bernie Bickerstaff. 

On November 29, 2006, Wilkens was hired as vice chairman of the SuperSonics&#x27; ownership group, and was later named the Sonics&#x27; President of Basketball Operations on April 27, 2007. On July 6, 2007, Wilkens resigned from the Sonics organization.

==Broadcasting career==
Wilkens later worked at Northwest FSN Studio as a college basketball analyst and occasionally appears on College Hoops Northwest at game nights.

== Personal life ==
Since 1962, Wilkens has been married to Marilyn Reed; they have three children, Leesha, Randy and Jamee. The Wilkens have seven grandchildren, six girls and one boy.

Wilkens is the founder of the Lenny Wilkens Foundation for Children and lives in Medina, Washington. He is a practicing Catholic.

==Quotes==
*&quot;I learned my basketball on the playgrounds of Brooklyn. Today, being a playground player is an insult. It means all you want to do is go one-on-one, it means your fundamentals stink and you don&#x27;t understand the game. But the playgrounds I knew were tremendous training grounds.&quot;
*&quot;Show people how to have success and then you can push their expectations up.&quot;

<text>Leonard Robert Carr, Baron Carr of Hadley, (11 November 1916 – 17 February 2012) was a British Conservative Party politician who served as Home Secretary from 1972 to 1974. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 26 years, and later served in the House of Lords as a life peer.

==Background==
Leonard Robert Carr was born in North Finchley on 11 November 1916. He was educated at Westminster School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read Natural Sciences, graduating in 1938. After graduation he applied his knowledge of metallurgy at John Dale &amp; Co, the family metal engineering firm. A collapsed lung kept him from war service but his firm specialised in the construction of airframes for Lancaster bombers.

In 1943, Carr married Joan Twining, and they had a son and two daughters. Their son, David, died in a traffic accident in 1965. 

==Political career==
Carr first sought the Conservative nomination in Barnet ahead of the 1950 election, but lost to Reginald Maudling. He was instead elected Member of Parliament for Mitcham in 1950 and served there until 1974, when the seat was merged and he moved to Carshalton. He was a parliamentary private secretary to Anthony Eden from to 1951 to 1955, and a parliamentary secretary to the labour ministry after Eden became prime minister. 

Carr was a supporter of the European Economic Community, and was amiable to Edward Heath&#x27;s election as Conservative Party leader in 1965, even though he had supported Maudling despite Maudling having earlier defeated Carr for the Barnet nomination. When Heath became prime minister in 1970, he served as Secretary of State for Employment and was responsible for the modernising Industrial Relations Act 1971, which balanced the introduction of compensation for unfair dismissal with curbs on the freedom to strike and the virtual abolition of closed shop agreements. The Industrial Relations Act 1971 was deeply disliked by trade unions, whose industrial action lead to the three-day week and ultimately to the defeat of the Heath government. The victorious Labour Party promptly repealed the Industrial Relations Act and replaced it with the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, which scrapped the &quot;offensive&quot; provisions but effectively re-enacted the remainder of Carr&#x27;s 1971 Act.

In 1971, Carr escaped injury when The Angry Brigade anarchist group exploded two bombs outside his house. More than thirty years later, a member of the group issued a public apology to Carr and sent him a Christmas card.

In 1972, Carr served a brief period as Lord President of the Council and then was appointed Home Secretary following Reginald Maudling&#x27;s resignation. Following Heath&#x27;s defeat in the first ballot of the 1975 Conservative leadership contest, he asked Carr to &quot;take over the functions of leader&quot; until a new leader was elected. The day after her election the new leader, Margaret Thatcher met with Carr, according to her at his request, before she formed shadow cabinet. According to her memoirs, Carr had been close to Heath and so she would have understood &quot;if he did not relish the prospect of serving under&quot; her. She stated that Carr made it clear that the only post that he would accept would be that of Shadow Foreign Secretary. She told him that she could not promise that and confided in her memoirs that at that stage, she was still considering appointments and was &quot;not convinced&quot; that she would offer Carr any role in the shadow cabinet. She proceeded to appoint Maudling as Shadow Foreign Secretary and saw Carr again later to inform him of her decision. In her memoirs, she speculated that Carr might have been &quot;persuaded to stay in another capacity&quot; but did not offer him the chance and noted, &quot;I was not keen to have another strong opponent in any position on the team&quot;. 

In 1975, Carr co-founded the Tory Reform Group.

==Later life==
Carr was created a life peer as Baron Carr of Hadley, of Monken Hadley in Greater London, in 1976. He served on the board for a number of companies, including Cadbury Schweppes, Prudential Assurance (which he chaired from 1980 to 1985), and Securicor. From 1985 to 1986, he was president of the Surrey County Cricket Club.

Carr died from bronchopneumonia at a nursing home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, 17 February 2012, at the age of 95. His body was buried in the graveyard of St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Farmington, Gloucestershire. He was survived by his wife, Joan, and two daughters.

<text>Murderdolls was an American rock band formed in Hollywood, California in 2002. Its lineup consisted of core members Wednesday 13 and Joey Jordison while former touring members included Ben Graves, Acey Slade, Eric Griffin and Tripp Eisen.

The band released two albums, the first in the form of &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls&quot; which was released in 2002. Though the band had limited initial success in the United States, their album and singles charted well in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan. Their second album, &quot;Women and Children Last&quot;, was released in August 2010. Wednesday 13 confirmed the band&#x27;s split in an interview in July 2013.

== Characteristics ==
The sound of the band is made up of their shared influences, which musically are punk rock and as well as from some of the 1970s hard rock acts (such as Kiss and Alice Cooper). The band also share a large interest in horror movies, from which they take most of their images and references.

Lyrically, the group most often present themselves in a &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; manner, covering topics of necrophilia, grave robbing, cross-dressing, amongst other things.

The Murderdolls are often described as &quot;Mötley Crüe meets the Misfits&quot; by critics and fans alike.

== History ==

=== Early years ===

Some consider the Murderdolls history to go back as far as 1994 to a Des Moines, Iowa-based band Joey Jordison played in, named The Rejects, which was fronted by vocalist Dizzy Draztik. The sound of the band was somewhat comparable to what the Murderdolls would later develop, minus the horror themed lyrics.

The Rejects split up as Jordison&#x27;s other band Slipknot were signed to a major label. During the 1999 Ozzfest tour, Jordison met Tripp Eisen and asked him if he was interested in a project he had in mind, the reforming of the Rejects with Draztik. Eisen agreed to join the project and a friend of his from the band Dope and previously the Genitorturers, Racci Shay played drums with them. Also a bassist named Ian, who had played in New York based band the Vampire Love Dolls (fronted by Acey Slade who was known as J at the time), played with them live.

=== Formation, &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls&quot; (2001–2002) ===
Dizzy Draztik introduced Joey Jordison to the music of the Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13, a horror punk band from Charlotte, North Carolina, fronted by vocalist Wednesday 13. Draztik persuaded the band to invite the Drag Queens frontman to play with the Rejects. The pair had previously considered bringing Wednesday 13 into the band before Eisen joined. Wednesday joined them in November 2001, where he was brought into the Rejects as a bassist. Tripp Eisen has claimed that he suggested that his friend Acey Slade was brought into the band around this time, but was turned down.

Soon, Wednesday 13 was moved to the frontman position after Dizzy left the band to take care of his ailing mother. The band changed their name to the Murderdolls and would soon adopt a horror themed approach. In fact, in terms of material used Wednesday 13 became the driving force for it. Most of the tracks on the Murderdolls debut album were covers from his previous band Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. These covers which would later introduce a whole new audience to the past music of Wednesday 13.

Wednesday 13, Jordison and Eisen went into the recording studio to record a demo consisting on an albums worth of material. This demo ended up becoming the band&#x27;s first album. Because of the association of Eisen and Jordison&#x27;s other bands, was to be released on Roadrunner Records. Primarily the recording features Wednesday 13 and Joey Jordison playing all of the instruments and vocals, however Eisen recorded some of the guitar solos on it.

Around this time in late March 2002, Ben Graves and Eric Griffin, two musicians native of Boston, Massachusetts but were living in Hollywood, California at the time joined the Murderdolls. They were brought in after Eisen showed Jordison a video of himself jamming with the pair, they decided the duo would be right for the band. And although they would feature on the debut album artwork, they did not actually play on the album itself. The band played their first show together as the Murderdolls on July 30, 2002, at San Diego&#x27;s Epicenter club.

An EP was released in early 2002 named &quot;Right to Remain Violent&quot; and featured some tracks from the forthcoming album. The full-length album soon followed, titled &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls&quot;. The initial release featured fifteen tracks; twelve in total had previously been recorded by Wednesday 13 with Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 and one from his earlier band Maniac Spider Trash. 13 did however write all of the aforementioned tracks himself.

The song &quot;Welcome to the Strange&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;. This track was later available as a bonus track on an expanded release of the debut album along with the single White Wedding; a Billy Idol cover.

Upon its release the Murderdolls album was promoted to the public as the &quot;other band&quot; of Joey Jordison, the drummer of Slipknot, or a &quot;collaboration&quot; between Jordison and Tripp Eisen. At the time Wednesday 13&#x27;s importance as songwriter wasn&#x27;t known by the public. The lead single from the album was titled &quot;Dead in Hollywood&quot;, the promotional video featured a guest appearance by Marilyn Manson, who had previously become friends with Jordison and was returning the favor of him earlier appearing in the video for &quot;Tainted Love&quot;.

In July 2002 Eisen announced he was leaving the band and returning to his main band Static-X as they were due to record a new album at the time. Eisen&#x27;s former Dope bandmate Acey Slade was brought in to replace him on guitar.

=== Touring (2002–2004) ===

The first tour dates of the &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls World Tour&quot; took the band through parts of the United States including; Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and Jordison&#x27;s native Iowa. Their first major date was at the Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan during August 18, 2002, two days before their debut album was released. This helped them gain a fan base in Japan.

Following this they played some dates in Europe, including a tour of the United Kingdom with AntiProduct (the lead singer of which, Alex Kane, briefly replaced Griffin on bass when he had to return home during the tour) and Ireland.

Their restless touring continued throughout 2002 into 2003, where they played in several major festivals; first, they played at the Australian festival Big Day Out, going on after Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters headlined the event. They were received favorably and one reviewer commented on the band&#x27;s performance as a &quot;mangled, choked and psychotic version of the Sex Pistols.&quot; The other major festival dates during this time were Download Festival and Rock am Ring, Iron Maiden headlined both of the festivals.

Together, the band recorded a cover version of Billy Idol&#x27;s &quot;White Wedding&quot;. A promotional video was recorded for it, in which they mocked popstar singing contests such as the &quot;Idol&quot; series. It was released as a single in the United Kingdom and they even performed it on the UK chart show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Mid 2003 The Murderdolls co-headlined a tour of England with fellow Roadrunner Records band, Stone Sour, which contained two of Jordison&#x27;s fellow members of Slipknot; Corey Taylor and James Root.

Murderdolls toured at the end of 2003 in support of the single and the re-release of their debut, which included their Billy Idol cover as well as five other bonus tracks and b-sides: &quot;Let&#x27;s Fuck&#x27;&quot;, &quot;I Take Drugs&quot;, &quot;Crash Crash&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Strange&quot; and &quot;I Love to Say Fuck&quot;. The latter two had previously been recorded by Wednesday 13 with the Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. The tour went through many European countries including Spain, Italy, Croatia, and Scandinavian countries before ending with a four date tour of the UK supported by English psychobilly band Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster.

Murderdolls played their last show on January 17, 2004, in Corona, California. After this they went on an indefinite hiatus with Jordison returning to Slipknot. Since the hiatus begun, both Wednesday 13 and Jordison maintained that the band had not split up for good, and that they would return to record a second album together in the future. Additionally, in a 2009 interview, Slade revealed that he would have been happy to reform the Murderdolls by now, but it always proves impossible due to other commitments of the band members.

=== Reunion, &quot;Women and Children Last&quot; and breakup (2010–2011) ===

In February 2010, whilst embarking on a solo tour in Australia, Wednesday 13 spoke with &quot;Drum Media&quot; and told them he was tossing up whether to record another solo album or record another Murderdolls album. He stated that the idea was still in talks, but would be his number one priority if the opportunity arose.

In March 2010, Jordison officially revealed to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine that Murderdolls had officially reunited with him and Wednesday working with producer Chris &quot;Zeuss&quot; Harris. Jordison said about the reunion, &quot;It&#x27;s been an ongoing conversation between Wednesday and I from 2006 until now. We were bored with everything out there, and thought we had something to piss people off and shake things up. Everything is such a product or a fucking formula these days... Fuck formula! Fuck the norm!&quot;

It was revealed on the band&#x27;s official website that the band would feature a new lineup without Slade, Griffin or Graves. Drummer Racci Shay joined the band alongside guitarist Roman Surman and bassist Jack Tankersley.

Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars recorded a guest appearance on the new album, whilst he was recording material for his debut solo album in the same space. On April 15, the band confirmed that they had finished recording their upcoming album &quot;Women and Children Last&quot;. Joey Jordison has said that he considers &quot;Women and Children Last&quot; as really the first true Murderdolls album.

The band was expected to embark on a tour of North America, but the idea was scrapped after Jordison began touring with Rob Zombie on the Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour and after the untimely death of his Slipknot bandmate Paul Gray. This led to the band performing only two shows in California in mid-June to promote their new album. The first show was captured on video and was released on DVD for the special edition of the album. Jordison resumed touring with Zombie in early July.

For &quot;Women and Children Last&quot;, Jordison and Wednesday 13 confessed to VerdamMnis Magazine that they consider this new release to be their very first album, as this is the first time they &quot;sat down together to write songs and the production is a far better than from &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls&quot;. They also revealed to the magazine that the CD was recorded in a mansion upon the Hollywood Hills, which encouraged them &quot;to create their own sound with no influence from the outside world&quot;, as they were secluded.

The album was released on August 31, 2010, through Roadrunner Records.

The band promoted the album on the Women &amp; Children Last World Tour, on which they supported Guns N&#x27; Roses on a handful of European dates, performed on the main stage at the UK edition of the Ozzfest, supported Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper on the &quot;Halloween Hootenanny Tour&quot; (Jordison performed double duty with Zombie and the Murderdolls), and performed on Fuel TV&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Habit&quot;. The band was expected to embark upon a headlining tour of North America in December, followed by a tour of the United Kingdom in January, before returning to Australia for the first time in 8 years to co-headline the Soundwave Festival.

The band announced that, along with their North America tour, &quot;Violent Night, Deadly Night Tour&quot;, they were releasing a music video for the song &quot;Nowhere&quot; from &quot;Women and Children Last&quot; on November 29, 2010. However, On November 29, 2010, it was announced that the &quot;Violent Night, Deadly Night Tour&quot; was canceled, due to family issues.

The last time the Murderdolls performed together was April 24, 2011. This final gig marked the last time Joey and 13 spoke. In March 2013, Wednesday 13 announced in an interview that the Murderdolls had split for good in 2011.

=== Post-breakup ===
In 2017, Wednesday 13 stated his interest in resurrecting the Murderdolls, and that Joey may also be interested. Further speculation came in July 2018 when Jordison claimed new material was ready to go and a reunion could happen when the time was right. However, in a February 2019 interview, Wednesday 13 stated that no progress on a reunion had occurred and that Joey and he were still friends.

On May 9, 2018, former drummer Ben &quot;The Ghoul&quot; Graves died of cancer at the age of 45. Wednesday 13, along with former members Eric Griffin and Acey Slade performed with each other for the first time in 14 years to pay tribute to their late drummer.

On July 26, 2021, Joey Jordison died at the age of 46.

<doc id="859556" wikidata="Q2030510" url="?curid=859556" title="The Singing Detective (film)">
<text>The Singing Detective is a 2003 American musical crime comedy film directed by Keith Gordon and loosely based on the BBC serial of the same name, a work by British writer Dennis Potter. It stars Robert Downey Jr. and features a supporting cast that includes Katie Holmes, Adrien Brody, Robin Wright Penn, Mel Gibson, Jeremy Northam and Carla Gugino as well as a number of songs from the 1950s.

== Plot ==

Detective novelist Dan Dark is hospitalized due to the skin disease psoriasis and crippling psoriatic arthritis. Around doctors and nurses, he occasionally hallucinates them in choreographed musical numbers. They attempt to help Dark but are dismissed by Dark&#x27;s anger and bitterness towards everyone. In an attempt to solve his mental issues, the doctors send him to psychiatrist Dr. Gibbon. The doctor suspects the thoughts behind these problems are in Dark&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret Detective&quot;, which is about a nightclub singer/private eye, hired by Mark Binney, who takes on a strange case involving prostitutes and two mysterious men. He fantasizes about the book during these meetings, with people from the real world acting as the fictional characters.

After reading some pages, Gibbon thinks Dark may have a problem with women. This leads to Dark flashing back to his childhood, when his mother worked as a prostitute and had sex with several men at the home, including his father&#x27;s business partner. People he encountered in his childhood act as characters in fantasies of his novel; his mother is a prostitute, his father&#x27;s business partner is a rich guy, and two passengers he only once encountered on a bus are thugs.

Despite his skin condition improving, his attitude worsens after learning a film studio is interested in purchasing the rights for &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;. He is informed of this by his wife Nicola, who also is a prostitute in the book fantasies. He is paranoid that Nicola is trying to steal the work so she can make money, and that Gibbon was met by a &quot;whore&quot; trying to get into the situation. Additionally, the two thugs from the fantasies have entered the real world, planning to rebel against the author for making them &quot;stand around&quot; constantly instead of playing more important roles, like being officers of the federal government.

Eventually, however, Dark is mentally cured through a civil discussion with Gibbon about his childhood. He states his father didn&#x27;t care about him due to being a &quot;pain-in-the-ass&quot; to raise, and Dan was often alone in his room to read. His father also constantly beat up his wife and kid. Just as he is about to be released from the hospital, he has another hallucination where reality meets his novel fantasies; the two thugs quickly drag his hospital bed throughout the building and attempt to kill him, while he also imagines himself as the detective alongside other vaudeville women. It ends with the fictional detective shooting the real author. After the hallucination, he leaves the hospital with his wife.

==Cast==
==Production==
Potter&#x27;s screenplay had been circulating in Hollywood for many years as Potter was enthusiastic about a film version. Robert Altman was at one time attached to direct with Dustin Hoffman in the lead, but financing proved difficult and the production was shelved. It was eventually discovered by an executive at Mel Gibson&#x27;s production company Icon Productions, who loved it and got Gibson on board to produce.

==Reception==
The film scored a 39% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 108 critics, with an average rating of 5.09/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Delightful performance from Robert Downey Jr. can&#x27;t save &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;&#x27;s transition from TV to the big screen&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on 33 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Caryn James said that &quot;the pared-down screen version sacrifices the sense of discovery that made the mini-series so emotionally powerful&quot;. On the other hand, Roger Ebert liked the film and found it to be &quot;a moving experience&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; was released on October 14, 2003. It consisted of songs from the 1950s rather than the 1940s as in the original television series.

<doc id="859561" wikidata="Q765540" url="?curid=859561" title="Munster cheese">
<text>Munster (), Munster-géromé, or (Alsatian) Minschterkaas, is a soft cheese with a strong taste and aroma, made mainly from milk first produced in the Vosges, between the Alsace, Lorraine and Franche-Comté regions in France. The name &quot;Munster&quot; is derived from the Alsatian town of Munster, where, among Vosgian abbeys and monasteries, the cheese was conserved and matured in monks&#x27; cellars. &quot;Géromé&quot;, a variant from munster, comes from the Vosgien patois pronunciation of the town of Gérardmer, located on the Lorrain side of the Vosges mountains, where it originates.

== History ==

This cheese originated in the Admodiation, an area on the top of the Vosgian mountains of France, named &quot;Chaumes&quot; or &quot;Les grandes Chaumes&quot; (comitatus Calvomontensis). &quot;Calvomontensis&quot; is the Latin for a mountaintop without woods.

As early as 1371, and possibly before, these territories were occupied by cattle herds driven by men, called &quot;&quot;marcaires&quot; (from the Alsatian &quot;Malker&quot;&quot;, Milker in English), pastured there between May and September. When the herds returned to their valleys, the cattle herdsmen first paid the fees and tithes to the religious and political owners of the summer pastures or simply financiers of these migrations. During feudal times these owners possessed all goods, living creatures, rights of pasture and cattle. Those who herded were known as serfs.

This mountain population paid their debts with cheese and jars of butter. The lords were the first religious establishments, women like &quot;chanoinesses&quot; from Remiremont or from Andlau, or men such as the &quot;chanoines&quot; or canons from Murbach or Saint-Dié, Benedictines from Munster, Senones, Moyenmoutier, and other monastic areas. Political protectors included the duke of Lorraine, count of Salm, count of Ribeaupierre, and other Alsatian noblemen.

During the 17th century, this tradition, though disappearing, was maintained in two special places, Gérardmer in the western Lorraine part of the main range and Munster for the east and Alsatian part. Hence the two names of this cheese, &quot;gérômé&quot; and &quot;Munster&quot; written with little type.

== PDO in the European Union ==
In the European Union, munster cheese is protected by an &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC). This certification places the main steps of the cheese process under control. The producers are required to observe rigorously:

* A limited area of milk production, including a major part of Vosges, near the mountains of Alsace; the départements Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin; a few communes in département Haute-Saône; Belfort Territory; and the cantons of départements Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle.
* Precise characteristics of the transformation in cheese.
It is made from unpasteurized cow&#x27;s milk called &quot;crude&quot; or raw milk, from the above-described &quot;zone d&#x27;appellation contrôlée&quot;. This soft white cheese is formed into flat cylinders, with two common dimensions: little Munster gérômé has a diameter; big Munster gérômé (commonly just called Munster) has a diameter.

* Cheese &quot;affinage&quot;
The cheese&#x27;s crust must be washed regularly. It is matured in damp cellars for five weeks for the smaller formats (roughly 300 g) and up to 2 to 3 months for the larger ones (about 1500 g). During this period, the rind is periodically washed with brine. The added moisture helps the development of bacteria that gives this cheese its particular taste and color.

* Quality control is maintained in storage, packaging and labeling (called &quot;étiquetage&quot;). The cheese, now round with a fat content of 45% in dry matter, has a diameter between 12 and , and a thickness between and . Normally it is sold unwrapped on a straw bed, but for export it may be wrapped in cellophane or clear plastic. The cheese should have a slick shiny brick-colored or orange rind, with apparent moisture on it; a semi-soft body; a very strong and penetrating odor; and a very strong taste. Defects can be an unripened body (crumbly), a broken rind, too salty or too old and overdone.

&quot;Munster géromé&quot; is at its best in the summer and the autumn, when it is made from milk from the &quot;haute chaumes&quot; (&quot;high stubble&quot;) of pastures that have already been mowed for midsummer hay in the Vosges mountains. The best cheeses, in some people&#x27;s opinion, come from the &quot;haute vallée de Munster&quot; itself, but this cheese is also made in Lapoutroie, Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, Villé, and other villages practically or in western Vosges, in Lorraine. Local opinions vary greatly on the best source according to their individual tastes.

== Genericization of the term ==
Although first produced in France, production of Munster cheese has grown outside of the historic PDO region, which outside the European Union has led to the genericization of the term “munster”. The cheese is also known as “creamy muenster” in the United States.

The United States Food and Drug Administration has established what are known as standards of identity (SOIs).  SOIs establish the common name for a food and define the basic nature of that food and its ingredients.  The US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21--FOOD AND DRUGS, CHAPTER I--FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, SUBCHAPTER B--FOOD FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION establishes the production process of “muenster” cheese. This SOI, in addition to establishing “muenster” as the product name for this type of cheese for production in the United States, would also apply to any “muenster” cheese imported from non-United States countries.

<doc id="859566" wikidata="Q1143818" url="?curid=859566" title="Gibson ES-335">
<text>The Gibson ES-335 is a semi-hollow body semi-acoustic guitar introduced by the Gibson Guitar Corporation as part of its ES (Electric Spanish) series in 1958. It has a solid maple wood block running through the center of its body with hollow upper bouts and two violin-style f-holes cut into the top over the hollow chambers. Gibson has released numerous variations and models based on the ES-335.

The ES-335 is manufactured at the Gibson Nashville facility, as of 2024. It was also produced at Gibson Memphis from 2000 until the facility closed in 2019.

==History==
Until 1952, Gibson produced only hollow-body guitars, which are prone to feedback when amplified loudly. That year saw the introduction of their first solid-body, the Gibson Les Paul, a significantly different instrument from Les Paul&#x27;s early electric guitar experiment, &quot;The Log&quot;, which consisted of a center block with detachable chambers on both sides, a neck, hardware, and a pickup attached. By 1958, Gibson was making a few solid-body models that had much lower feedback and better sustain but lacked the darker, warmer tone and unamplified volume of hollow bodies. The ES-335 was an attempt to find a middle ground: a warmer tone than a solid body produced with almost as little feedback. Though semi-hollow-bodies like the ES-335 are essentially a compromise of earlier designs, they are for this reason extremely flexible, as shown by the ES-335&#x27;s popularity in a wide range of music, including blues, jazz, and rock. Initially offered at a basic price of $267.50, it quickly became a best-seller, and has been in continuous production since 1958.

The first major update came in mid-1962, with the most visible change being the neck markers; early models had dots (hence &quot;dot neck&quot;), later models had blocks.

==Models==
Some models (ES-347, ES-369) have a coil split switch, which allows the humbuckers to produce a &quot;single-coil&quot; sound. The ES-335 Pro, ES-335TD CRS, and CRR models had Gibson &quot;Dirty Fingers&quot; humbuckers, which had a higher output than the standard pickups.

The company has produced a number of signature guitars as well, such as Trini Lopez-inspired model (1964–1970) with narrow diamond-shaped soundholes replacing the f-holes, a Firebird-style headstock with all the tuners on one side, and slashed-diamond inlays. In September 2007, Gibson introduced the DG-335, designed with Dave Grohl. A variation on the Trini Lopez Gibson, the Grohl model has a stopbar tailpiece and Gibson&#x27;s new Burstbucker humbuckers. Other signature models have included the heavily customized Alvin Lee &quot;Big Red&quot; 335. A $4,000 reissue of the 1963 model was a 2014 &quot;Editor&#x27;s pick&quot; in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine.

==Variations==

===Trini Lopez===
Two Trini Lopez signature models—the Trini Lopez Standard and the Trini Lopez Custom—were initially produced from 1964 to 1971, and reissues have been produced periodically since the initial run.

The Trini Lopez Standard has the same body shape and profile as the ES-335, with diamond-shaped holes in the place of the f-shaped holes, a Gibson Firebird headstock (of the ‘non-reverse’ style), split diamond inlays on the fingerboard, a trapeze tailpiece with a plaque with Trini Lopez&#x27;s name, and a standard cherry red finish. A modified version of the Trini Lopez Standard, with a stop-tailpiece and a custom Pelham Blue finish is used by Dave Grohl as his primary stage guitar; the Gibson Custom Shop produced a market version known as the &quot;DG-335&quot; in 2015.

The Trini Lopez Custom came in a standard cherry sunburst finish, had a thicker body and cutout bouts with pointed tips instead of the standard rounded tips (similar to the Gibson Barney Kessel Custom guitar), a more ornate pickguard, and different locations for its two selector switches, but otherwise had the same tailpiece, fingerboard, headstock, and electronics as the Trini Lopez Standard.

===ES-345===

The Gibson ES-345 (semi-hollow) was first produced in 1958 as an upscale version of the ES-335. Although the design is very similar to the 335, the 345 featured a multi-position &quot;Varitone&quot; switch located just above the lead tone and volume controls, which added various combinations of inductors and capacitors to the electronic pickup circuit of the guitar in order to alter its resonant frequency and add &quot;color&quot; to the sound. The ES-345 also featured an optional stereophonic output jack, gold plated hardware, large split parallelogram fingerboard inlays (similar to ES 175), and a thicker three-ply edge binding than that of the ES-335.

Notable users include Chuck Berry, B.B. King, Freddie King, Bill Nelson, Jorma Kaukonen, Fred Frith, Porl Thompson of The Cure, Steve Howe, Bob Welch, Elvin Bishop and the character of Marty McFly in the 1985 comedy film &quot;Back to the Future.&quot; British guitar player John McLaughlin owns a Sunburst ES-345 modified with a Bigsby tailpiece and a scalloped fingerboard. He played this guitar in the One Truth Band and Trio of Doom.

The ES-345 was discontinued in 1981, one year after the Gibson Lucille, which is based on the ES-355 (see below), was launched. The differences between the two models are:
* The headstock inlay on ES-345 is a &quot;small crown&quot; rather than the &quot;split-diamond&quot; custom inlay on the ES-355.
* The position markers on ES-345 are &quot;split parallelogram&quot; rather than the &quot;block&quot; inlays used on the ES-355. Also, the first fret on the ES-345 is not inlaid.
* The stereo output wiring and the Varitone was factory-installed on the ES-345 and ES-355TD-SV, but not on the unmodified ES-355TD (mono version).
* The vibrato unit (Vibrola or Bigsby) was an option on the ES-345; In contrast, it was factory-installed on most ES-355s (except for the earlier models in the 1950s, final models after 1979, and Lucille).
As of 2020, The ES-345 is back in production. Instead of the Varitone switch and stereo output, this new version differentiates from the ES-335 mostly in its traditional aesthetics, but does feature a thermally-engineered maple centerblock and quartersawn adirondack spruce bracing.
===ES-355===
The Gibson ES-355 (Thinline semi-hollow, Double pickups) was at the top of Gibson&#x27;s range of thinline semi-hollowbody electric guitars. It was manufactured from 1958 to 1982, fitted with the Varitone Stereo option (SV), as the ES-355TD-SV released in 1959. This guitar is now available in reissues from Gibson&#x27;s main line or custom shop.

The headstock has a split-diamond inlay rather than the smaller crown inlay on the 335/345, in addition to a multiple-layered binding. The fingerboard inlays are inlaid mother-of-pearl blocks, beginning at the first position of the fretboard. In addition to the headstock, binding is also applied to the fretboard and both the front and the back edges of the body. Rather than the rosewood fretboard on a 335 or 345, both variations of the 355 have an ebony fingerboard for a &#x27;smoother&#x27; sound. Reissues use a richlite fingerboard. Early models of Epiphone&#x27;s limited edition budget version had an ebony fingerboard but the later issues had a rosewood board.

The ES-355 was available with a Vibrola vibrato unit or a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. It was also available with a stereo output and Varitone tone filter circuitry. When fitted with the optional stereo wiring and Varitone, the model was known as the ES-355TD-SV.

===Lucille (B.B. King signature model)===

The best-known user of the ES-355 is probably B.B. King, whose trademark guitar, Lucille, was the basis for a 1981 signature model. It has the optional stereo wiring and Varitone circuitry as standard. It differs from the ES-355 by having a maple neck instead of mahogany, the name &quot;Lucille&quot; on the headstock, and the lack of an F-hole on its top.

===EB-2 and EB-2D===

The EB-2 was first produced in 1958 as the bass version of the ES-335. Having the same body as the ES-335, it held a 30.5&quot; scale neck and hardware borrowed directly from the Gibson EB-0.The pickup was actually a single coil with the polepieces on the lower edge of the black cover until mid 1959.The humbucking pickup has the poles in the center of a black cover. In 1959, a &quot;baritone-switch&quot; was added to filter the output from the neck humbucker and give it more of a guitar-like sound. The EB-2 was discontinued at the end of 1961, being replaced by the EB-3. Due to a boom in the use of the EB-2 and its sibling, the Epiphone Rivoli, in the Merseybeat in England in the early sixties, production restarted in 1964, with a 2-pickup version called the EB-2D being added to the line in 1966. In 1972 the EB-2 line was discontinued.

===CS Series===
The CS-336 is a smaller version of the ES-335. The back and sides of this guitar are constructed from a single piece of carved mahogany, and its reduced size is closer to that of the Les Paul. Also available, the CS-356 has gold plated hardware and multiple binding on the body, neck and headstock. In 2007, Gibson introduced the ES-339 with the size of the CS-336 and the laminate construction of the ES-335.

=== DG-335 ===

Dave Grohl received an early 60s 335 from Axl Rose as a gift, which was handpicked by Slash. Grohl called it the “nicest I have ever played in my life”. His own version, the DG-335 is based on the Trini Lopez Standard specs, but in a different color and with a stop tailpiece instead of the Trini Lopez&#x27;s trapeze tailpiece.

=== Chris Cornell ES-335 ===
Chris Cornell 335s are based on the Gibson ES-335. The Chris Cornell ES-335 Tribute was designed by Gibson and Chris himself based on the guitars he played in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, mostly Gretsch Jet models, but in Gibson&#x27;s own 335 style, using the same construction of a typical 335 with the 3ply maple top, maple center block, mahogany neck, rosewood fretboard, but with Lollartron™ pickups in the neck and bridge, resembling the classic look on the Filter&#x27;tron™ pickups, used extensively by Gretsch. Also they feature one model (Olive Dab Green) with a Bigsby B7 vibrato tailpiece and another (Satin Ebony) with a Tune O Matic tailpiece.

=== Epiphone ===
Gibson also markets a much less expensive version of the ES-335 under its Epiphone brand, called the &quot;Dot&quot; (referring to its dot-style inlay). Other Epiphone semi-hollowbody style models include the Sheraton (a fancier version of the co-developed ES-335, released the same week, it can make equal claim as the first semi-hollowbody), the Riviera, and the Dot Studio, though some of those are modeled after other guitars in the ES series.

From 1958 to 1970, Epiphone guitars were produced in Gibson&#x27;s Kalamazoo, MI factory, and shared the similar design, materials and electronics as their Gibson counterparts. The Riviera, Sheraton, Rivoli and Newport models shared similarities with the Gibson ES-335, EB-2 and EB-0 models, respectively. In 1970, Epiphone production ceased in the Kalamazoo plants and Epiphones were made at the Matsumoku factory in Japan. Later Epiphones were constructed under contract with Samick in Korea. Since 2002, almost all Epiphones have been made in the &#x27;Gibson&#x27; Qingdao plant in China.

As of 2012, Epiphone also produces the ES-335 PRO, ES-339 PRO, ES-345 Stereo, ES-355, and the Lucille. The ES-335 Pro and ES-339 both feature coil-tapped humbuckers, activated by pull-push volume knobs; the ES-355, gold hardware and a Bigsby tremolo, while the ES-345 Stereo has a Bigsby and VariTone control. The Lucille meanwhile, also features a VariTone control and, in keeping with BB King&#x27;s Gibson signature model, no f-holes and a fine tuning stop bar tailpiece.

===Other===
Other models based on the 335 include the ES-333, the ES-340 (the toggle switch has settings of the pickups in-phase, pickups out-of-phase and standby), the ES-347 (includes a coil tap, block markers on an ebony fretboard, fine tuning tailpiece and, on earlier models, a brass nut, and a greater sustain block), the ES-339, essentially a 335 with the body reduced to Les Paul size; and the Gibson Les Paul signature bass.

Although the ES-330 resembles the 335, it is actually fully hollow (as opposed to semi-hollow) and features two P-90 pickups (as opposed to 2 humbucking pickups), and it was designed as the successor to the Gibson ES-225.

<text>Meyer Levin (October 7, 1905 – July 9, 1981) was an American novelist. Perhaps best known for his work on the Leopold and Loeb case, Levin worked as a journalist (for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; and from 1933 to 1939, he worked as an editor for &quot;Esquire&quot;).

==Career==
Levin was born in Chicago. He published six novels before World War II. Even though the critical response to them was good, none of them were financially successful. &quot;Reporter&quot; (1929) was a novel of the modern newspapers, &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; (1930) an urban romance, &quot;Yehuda&quot; (1931) takes place on a kibbutz, and &quot;The New Bridge&quot; (1933) dealt with unemployed construction workers at the beginning of the Depression. In 1937, Levin published &quot;The Old Bunch&quot;, a story of immigrant Chicago Jewry that James T. Farrell called &quot;one of the most serious and ambitious novels yet produced by the current generation of American novelists.&quot; &quot;Citizens&quot; (1940) was a fictional account of the 1937 strike at the Republic Steel Company plant outside Chicago.

He also wrote and directed a documentary titled &quot;The Illegals&quot;, for the Office Of War. The film dealt with the smuggling of Jews out of Poland.

Levin was a war correspondent in Europe during World War II, representing the Overseas News Agency and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

After the war, Levin wrote, with the approval of the Frank family, a play which was based on &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, but his play was not produced. Instead, another version of the same story which was dramatized by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett reached Broadway. Levin sued for plagiarism.

Meyer wrote the 1956 novel &quot;Compulsion&quot;, inspired by the Leopold and Loeb case. The novel, for which Levin was given a Special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America in 1957, was the basis for Levin&#x27;s own 1957 play adaptation and the 1959 film which was based on it, starring Orson Welles. &quot;Compulsion&quot; was &quot;the first &#x27;documentary&#x27; or &#x27;non-fiction novel&#x27; (&quot;a style later used in Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot;&quot;).

Levin died in Jerusalem.

<text>CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer), Volder&#x27;s algorithm, Digit-by-digit method, Circular CORDIC (Jack E. Volder), Linear CORDIC, Hyperbolic CORDIC (John Stephen Walther), and Generalized Hyperbolic CORDIC (GH CORDIC) (Yuanyong Luo et al.), is a simple and efficient algorithm to calculate trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, square roots, multiplications, divisions, and exponentials and logarithms with arbitrary base, typically converging with one digit (or bit) per iteration. CORDIC is therefore also an example of digit-by-digit algorithms. CORDIC and closely related methods known as pseudo-multiplication and pseudo-division or factor combining are commonly used when no hardware multiplier is available (e.g. in simple microcontrollers and field-programmable gate arrays or FPGAs), as the only operations they require are additions, subtractions, bitshift and lookup tables. As such, they all belong to the class of shift-and-add algorithms. In computer science, CORDIC is often used to implement floating-point arithmetic when the target platform lacks hardware multiply for cost or space reasons.

==History==
Similar mathematical techniques were published by Henry Briggs as early as 1624 and Robert Flower in 1771, but CORDIC is better optimized for low-complexity finite-state CPUs.

CORDIC was conceived in 1956 by Jack E. Volder at the aeroelectronics department of Convair out of necessity to replace the analog resolver in the B-58 bomber&#x27;s navigation computer with a more accurate and faster real-time digital solution. Therefore, CORDIC is sometimes referred to as a digital resolver.

In his research Volder was inspired by a formula in the 1946 edition of the &quot;CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics&quot;:
: formula_1
where formula_2 is such that formula_3, and formula_4.

His research led to an internal technical report proposing the CORDIC algorithm to solve sine and cosine functions and a prototypical computer implementing it. The report also discussed the possibility to compute hyperbolic coordinate rotation, logarithms and exponential functions with modified CORDIC algorithms. Utilizing CORDIC for multiplication and division was also conceived at this time. Based on the CORDIC principle, Dan H. Daggett, a colleague of Volder at Convair, developed conversion algorithms between binary and binary-coded decimal (BCD).

In 1958, Convair finally started to build a demonstration system to solve radar fix–taking problems named &quot;CORDIC I&quot;, completed in 1960 without Volder, who had left the company already. More universal &quot;CORDIC II&quot; models &quot;A&quot; (stationary) and &quot;B&quot; (airborne) were built and tested by Daggett and Harry Schuss in 1962.

Volder&#x27;s CORDIC algorithm was first described in public in 1959, which caused it to be incorporated into navigation computers by companies including Martin-Orlando, Computer Control, Litton, Kearfott, Lear-Siegler, Sperry, Raytheon, and Collins Radio.

Volder teamed up with Malcolm McMillan to build &quot;Athena&quot;, a fixed-point desktop calculator utilizing his binary CORDIC algorithm. The design was introduced to Hewlett-Packard in June 1965, but not accepted. Still, McMillan introduced David S. Cochran (HP) to Volder&#x27;s algorithm and when Cochran later met Volder he referred him to a similar approach John E. Meggitt (IBM) had proposed as &quot;pseudo-multiplication&quot; and &quot;pseudo-division&quot; in 1961. Meggitt&#x27;s method also suggested the use of base 10 rather than base 2, as used by Volder&#x27;s CORDIC so far. These efforts led to the ROMable logic implementation of a decimal CORDIC prototype machine inside of Hewlett-Packard in 1966, built by and conceptually derived from Thomas E. Osborne&#x27;s prototypical &quot;Green Machine&quot;, a four-function, floating-point desktop calculator he had completed in DTL logic in December 1964. This project resulted in the public demonstration of Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s first desktop calculator with scientific functions, the HP 9100A in March 1968, with series production starting later that year.

When Wang Laboratories found that the HP 9100A used an approach similar to the &quot;factor combining&quot; method in their earlier LOCI-1 (September 1964) and LOCI-2 (January 1965) &quot;Logarithmic Computing Instrument&quot; desktop calculators, they unsuccessfully accused Hewlett-Packard of infringement of one of An Wang&#x27;s patents in 1968.

John Stephen Walther at Hewlett-Packard generalized the algorithm into the &quot;Unified CORDIC&quot; algorithm in 1971, allowing it to calculate hyperbolic functions, natural exponentials, natural logarithms, multiplications, divisions, and square roots. The CORDIC subroutines for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions could share most of their code. This development resulted in the first scientific handheld calculator, the HP-35 in 1972. Based on hyperbolic CORDIC, Yuanyong Luo et al. further proposed a Generalized Hyperbolic CORDIC (GH CORDIC) to directly compute logarithms and exponentials with an arbitrary fixed base in 2019. Theoretically, Hyperbolic CORDIC is a special case of GH CORDIC.

Originally, CORDIC was implemented only using the binary numeral system and despite Meggitt suggesting the use of the decimal system for his pseudo-multiplication approach, decimal CORDIC continued to remain mostly unheard of for several more years, so that Hermann Schmid and Anthony Bogacki still suggested it as a novelty as late as 1973 and it was found only later that Hewlett-Packard had implemented it in 1966 already.

Decimal CORDIC became widely used in pocket calculators, most of which operate in binary-coded decimal (BCD) rather than binary. This change in the input and output format did not alter CORDIC&#x27;s core calculation algorithms. CORDIC is particularly well-suited for handheld calculators, in which low cost – and thus low chip gate count – is much more important than speed.

CORDIC has been implemented in the ARM-based STM32G4, Intel 8087, 80287, 80387 up to the 80486 coprocessor series as well as in the Motorola 68881 and 68882 for some kinds of floating-point instructions, mainly as a way to reduce the gate counts (and complexity) of the FPU sub-system.

== Applications ==
CORDIC uses simple shift-add operations for several computing tasks such as the calculation of trigonometric, hyperbolic and logarithmic functions, real and complex multiplications, division, square-root calculation, solution of linear systems, eigenvalue estimation, singular value decomposition, QR factorization and many others. As a consequence, CORDIC has been used for applications in diverse areas such as signal and image processing, communication systems, robotics and 3D graphics apart from general scientific and technical computation.

=== Hardware ===

The algorithm was used in the navigational system of the Apollo program&#x27;s Lunar Roving Vehicle to compute bearing and range, or distance from the Lunar module. CORDIC was used to implement the Intel 8087 math coprocessor in 1980, avoiding the need to implement hardware multiplication.

CORDIC is generally faster than other approaches when a hardware multiplier is not available (e.g., a microcontroller), or when the number of gates required to implement the functions it supports should be minimized (e.g., in an FPGA or ASIC).
In fact, CORDIC is a standard drop-in IP in FPGA development applications such as Vivado for Xilinx, while a power series implementation is not due to the specificity of such an IP, i.e. CORDIC can compute many different functions (general purpose) while a hardware multiplier configured to execute power series implementations can only compute the function it was designed for.

On the other hand, when a hardware multiplier is available (&quot;e.g.&quot;, in a DSP microprocessor), table-lookup methods and power series are generally faster than CORDIC. In recent years, the CORDIC algorithm has been used extensively for various biomedical applications, especially in FPGA implementations.

The STM32G4 series and certain STM32H7 series of MCUs implement a CORDIC module to accelerate computations in various mixed signal applications such as graphics for human-machine interface and field oriented control of motors. While not as fast as a power series approximation, CORDIC is indeed faster than interpolating table based implementations such as the ones provided by the ARM CMSIS and C standard libraries. Though the results may be slightly less accurate as the CORDIC modules provided only achieve 20 bits of precision in the result. For example, most of the performance difference compared to the ARM implementation is due to the overhead of the interpolation algorithm, which achieves full floating point precision (24 bits) and can likely achieve relative error to that precision. Another benefit is that the CORDIC module is a coprocessor and can be run in parallel with other CPU tasks.

The issue with using Taylor series is that while they do provide small absolute error, they do not exhibit well behaved relative error. Other means of polynomial approximation, such as minimax optimization, may be used to control both kinds of error.

=== Software ===
Many older systems with integer-only CPUs have implemented CORDIC to varying extents as part of their IEEE floating-point libraries. As most modern general-purpose CPUs have floating-point registers with common operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, sine, cosine, square root, log10, natural log, the need to implement CORDIC in them with software is nearly non-existent. Only microcontroller or special safety and time-constrained software applications would need to consider using CORDIC.

== Modes of operation ==

=== Rotation mode ===
CORDIC can be used to calculate a number of different functions. This explanation shows how to use CORDIC in &quot;rotation mode&quot; to calculate the sine and cosine of an angle, assuming that the desired angle is given in radians and represented in a fixed-point format. To determine the sine or cosine for an angle formula_5, the &quot;y&quot; or &quot;x&quot; coordinate of a point on the unit circle corresponding to the desired angle must be found. Using CORDIC, one would start with the vector formula_6:

: formula_7
In the first iteration, this vector is rotated 45° counterclockwise to get the vector formula_8. Successive iterations rotate the vector in one or the other direction by size-decreasing steps, until the desired angle has been achieved. Each step angle is formula_9 for formula_10.

More formally, every iteration calculates a rotation, which is performed by multiplying the vector formula_11 with the rotation matrix formula_12:

: formula_13

The rotation matrix is given by

: formula_14

Using the trigonometric identity:

: formula_15

the cosine factor can be taken out to give:

: formula_16

The expression for the rotated vector formula_17 then becomes:

: formula_18

where formula_19 and formula_20 are the components of formula_11. Setting the angle formula_22 for each iteration such that formula_23 still yields a series that converges to every possible output value. The multiplication with the tangent can therefore be replaced by a division by a power of two, which is efficiently done in digital computer hardware using a bit shift. The expression then becomes:

: formula_24

and formula_25 is used to determine the direction of the rotation: if the angle formula_22 is positive, then formula_25 is +1, otherwise it is −1.

The following trigonometric identity can be used to replace the cosine:

: formula_28,

giving this multiplier for each iteration:

: formula_29

The formula_30 factors can then be taken out of the iterative process and applied all at once afterwards with a scaling factor formula_31:

: formula_32

which is calculated in advance and stored in a table or as a single constant, if the number of iterations is fixed. This correction could also be made in advance, by scaling formula_6 and hence saving a multiplication. Additionally, it can be noted that

: formula_34

to allow further reduction of the algorithm&#x27;s complexity. Some applications may avoid correcting for formula_35 altogether, resulting in a processing gain formula_36:

: formula_37

After a sufficient number of iterations, the vector&#x27;s angle will be close to the wanted angle formula_5. For most ordinary purposes, 40 iterations (&quot;n&quot; = 40) are sufficient to obtain the correct result to the 10th decimal place.

The only task left is to determine whether the rotation should be clockwise or counterclockwise at each iteration (choosing the value of formula_39). This is done by keeping track of how much the angle was rotated at each iteration and subtracting that from the wanted angle; then in order to get closer to the wanted angle formula_5, if formula_41 is positive, the rotation is clockwise, otherwise it is negative and the rotation is counterclockwise:

: formula_42

: formula_43

The values of formula_44 must also be precomputed and stored. For small angles it can be approximated with formula_45 to reduce the table size.

As can be seen in the illustration above, the sine of the angle formula_5 is the &quot;y&quot; coordinate of the final vector formula_47 while the &quot;x&quot; coordinate is the cosine value.

=== Vectoring mode ===
The rotation-mode algorithm described above can rotate any vector (not only a unit vector aligned along the &quot;x&quot; axis) by an angle between −90° and +90°. Decisions on the direction of the rotation depend on formula_48 being positive or negative.

The vectoring-mode of operation requires a slight modification of the algorithm. It starts with a vector whose &quot;x&quot; coordinate is positive whereas the &quot;y&quot; coordinate is arbitrary. Successive rotations have the goal of rotating the vector to the &quot;x&quot; axis (and therefore reducing the &quot;y&quot; coordinate to zero). At each step, the value of &quot;y&quot; determines the direction of the rotation. The final value of formula_48 contains the total angle of rotation. The final value of &quot;x&quot; will be the magnitude of the original vector scaled by &quot;K&quot;. So, an obvious use of the vectoring mode is the transformation from rectangular to polar coordinates.

== Implementation ==

In Java the Math class has a codice_1 method to perform such a shift, C has the ldexp function, and the x86 class of processors have the codice_2 floating point operation.

=== Software example (Python) ===

from math import atan2, sqrt, sin, cos, radians

ITERS = 16
theta_table = [atan2(1, 2**i) for i in range(ITERS)]

def compute_K(n):
 Compute K(n) for n = ITERS. This could also be
 stored as an explicit constant if ITERS above is fixed.
 k = 1.0
 for i in range(n):
 k *= 1 / sqrt(1 + 2 ** (-2 * i))
 return k

def CORDIC(alpha, n):
 assert n &lt;= ITERS
 K_n = compute_K(n)
 theta = 0.0
 x = 1.0
 y = 0.0
 P2i = 1 # This will be 2**(-i) in the loop below
 for arc_tangent in theta_table[:n]:
 sigma = +1 if theta &lt; alpha else -1
 theta += sigma * arc_tangent
 x, y = x - sigma * y * P2i, sigma * P2i * x + y
 P2i /= 2
 return x * K_n, y * K_n

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
 # Print a table of computed sines and cosines, from -90° to +90°, in steps of 15°,
 # comparing against the available math routines.
 print(&quot; x sin(x) diff. sine cos(x) diff. cosine &quot;)
 for x in range(-90, 91, 15):
 cos_x, sin_x = CORDIC(radians(x), ITERS)
 print(
 f&quot;{x:+05.1f}° {sin_x:+.8f} ({sin_x-sin(radians(x)):+.8f}) {cos_x:+.8f} ({cos_x-cos(radians(x)):+.8f})&quot;

=== Hardware example ===
The number of logic gates for the implementation of a CORDIC is roughly comparable to the number required for a multiplier as both require combinations of shifts and additions. The choice for a multiplier-based or CORDIC-based implementation will depend on the context. The multiplication of two complex numbers represented by their real and imaginary components (rectangular coordinates), for example, requires 4 multiplications, but could be realized by a single CORDIC operating on complex numbers represented by their polar coordinates, especially if the magnitude of the numbers is not relevant (multiplying a complex vector with a vector on the unit circle actually amounts to a rotation). CORDICs are often used in circuits for telecommunications such as digital down converters.

== Double iterations CORDIC ==
In two of the publications by Vladimir Baykov, it was proposed to use the double iterations method for the implementation of the functions: arcsine, arccosine, natural logarithm, exponential function, as well as for the calculation of the hyperbolic functions. Double iterations method consists in the fact that unlike the classical CORDIC method, where the iteration step value changes &quot;every&quot; time, i.e. on each iteration, in the double iteration method, the iteration step value is repeated twice and changes only through one iteration. Hence the designation for the degree indicator for double iterations appeared: formula_50. Whereas with ordinary iterations: formula_51. The double iteration method guarantees the convergence of the method throughout the valid range of argument changes.

The generalization of the CORDIC convergence problems for the arbitrary positional number system with radix formula_52 showed that for the functions sine, cosine, arctangent, it is enough to perform formula_53 iterations for each value of i (i = 0 or 1 to n, where n is the number of digits), i.e. for each digit of the result. For the natural logarithm, exponential, hyperbolic sine, cosine and arctangent, formula_52 iterations should be performed for each value formula_55. For the functions arcsine and arccosine, two formula_53 iterations should be performed for each number digit, i.e. for each value of formula_55.

For inverse hyperbolic sine and arcosine functions, the number of iterations will be formula_58 for each formula_55, that is, for each result digit.

== Related algorithms ==
CORDIC is part of the class of &quot;shift-and-add&quot; algorithms, as are the logarithm and exponential algorithms derived from Henry Briggs&#x27; work. Another shift-and-add algorithm which can be used for computing many elementary functions is the BKM algorithm, which is a generalization of the logarithm and exponential algorithms to the complex plane. For instance, BKM can be used to compute the sine and cosine of a real angle formula_60 (in radians) by computing the exponential of formula_61, which is formula_62. The BKM algorithm is slightly more complex than CORDIC, but has the advantage that it does not need a scaling factor (&quot;K&quot;).

<doc id="859593" wikidata="Q753811" url="?curid=859593" title="Shinjū">
<text>is a Japanese term meaning &quot;double suicide&quot;, used in common parlance to refer to any group suicide of two or more individuals bound by love, typically lovers, parents and children, and even whole families. A double suicide without consent is called and it is considered as a sort of murder–suicide.

Lovers committing double suicide believed that they would be united again in heaven, a view supported by feudal teaching in Edo period Japan, which taught that the bond between two lovers is continued into the next world, and by the teaching of Pure Land Buddhism wherein it is believed that through double suicide, one can approach rebirth in the Pure Land.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;shinjū&quot; is formed by the characters for and . In this usage it literally means &quot;heart-inside&quot; or &quot;oneness of hearts&quot;, probably reflecting a psychological link between the participants.

== In popular culture ==
In Japanese theater and literary tradition, double suicides are the simultaneous suicides of two lovers whose or love for one another are at odds with &quot;giri&quot;, social conventions or familial obligations. Double suicides were rather common in Japan throughout history and double suicide is an important theme of the puppet theater repertory. The tragic denouement is usually known to the audience and is preceded by a &quot;michiyuki,&quot; a small poetical journey, where lovers evoke the happier moments of their lives and their attempts at loving each other.

The term plays a central role in works such as &quot;Shinjū Ten no Amijima&quot; (&quot;The Love Suicides at Amijima&quot;), written by the seventeenth-century tragedian Chikamatsu Monzaemon for the &quot;bunraku&quot; puppet theater. It would later be adapted as a film in 1969 under the title &quot;Double Suicide&quot; in English, in a modernist adaptation by the filmmaker Masahiro Shinoda, including a score by Toru Takemitsu.

In the preface for Donald Keene&#x27;s book &quot;Bunraku&quot;, writer Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki complained about the too-long endings known to be common in double suicide plays. In his novel &quot;Some Prefer Nettles&quot;, he parodies the notion of &quot;shinjū&quot; and gives it a social and sensual double suicide with no clear ending.

<doc id="859601" wikidata="Q648993" url="?curid=859601" title="Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC)">
<text>The siege of Rhodes in 305–304 BC was one of the most notable sieges of antiquity, when Demetrius Poliorcetes, son of Antigonus I, besieged Rhodes in an attempt to make it abandon its neutrality and end its close relationship with Ptolemy I.

The attempt ultimately proved unsuccessful, but the scale of the siege, along with the logistical, strategic, and engineering efforts of Demetrius Poliorcetes, cemented his reputation as a military engineer and city conqueror. The significant defense mounted by the Rhodians was also noted by the sources, and thus the siege gradually established itself, within Greek and Roman antiquity, as one of the most notable sieges of their shared past.

To celebrate their victory, the Rhodians erected the Colossus of Rhodes, usually considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

== Background ==
The island of Rhodes was a mercantile republic with a large navy which controlled the entrance to the Aegean Sea. Rhodes maintained treaties of neutrality with other empires to protect trade. However, they had a close relationship with Ptolemy I and Demetrius was worried Rhodes would supply him with ships. Demetrius also saw the possibility of Rhodes being used as a base of operations. The decision to lay siege to Rhodes was influenced by these fears but it was also effectively a piratical enterprise by Demetrius. Much of the Greek world, regardless of whether they were allies of Demetrius or not, apparently also viewed the siege as a pirate attack and sympathized with the Rhodians, and this attitude existed even in Macedonia.

Demetrius brought an army of roughly 40,000 men, whilst the Rhodians had a force of 6,000 citizens, 1000 metics and aliens, and an unspecified number of slaves, whom the Rhodians promised to buy and free from their masters if they proved themselves in battle.

Along with a fighting fleet of 200 ships and 150 auxiliary vessels, Demetrius also enlisted the aid of many pirate fleets. Over 1,000 private trading vessels followed his fleets in anticipation of the plunder his successes would bring. Diodorus Siculus reports that the whole strait between Rhodes and the mainland was filled by Demetrius’ armada.

== Siege ==

The city and main harbor of Rhodes was strongly fortified and Demetrius was unable to prevent supply ships from running his blockade, so capturing the harbor was his main objective. He first built his own harbor alongside the original and constructed a mole from which he deployed a floating boom, but Demetrius ultimately never succeeded in taking the harbor. Meanwhile, his army ravaged the island and built a huge camp next to the city, but just out of missile range. Early in the siege the walls were breached and a number of troops entered the city but they were all killed and Demetrius didn&#x27;t press the attack. The walls were subsequently repaired.

Both sides used many technical devices during the siege such as mines and counter-mines and various siege engines. Demetrius even built the now notable siege tower, known as the Helepolis, in his attempt to take the city.

The citizens of Rhodes were successful in resisting Demetrius; after one year he abandoned the siege and signed a peace agreement (304 BC) which Demetrius presented as a victory because Rhodes agreed to remain neutral in his war with Ptolemy (Egypt). The unpopularity of the siege may have been a factor in its abandonment after only one year.

Several years later the Helepolis, which had been abandoned, had its metal plating melted down and - along with the money from selling the remains of the siege engines and equipment left behind by Demetrius - was used to erect a statue of their sun god, Helios, now known as the Colossus of Rhodes, to commemorate their heroic resistance.

== Popular culture ==

L. Sprague de Camp used the siege and the building of the Colossus in one of his historical novels, &quot;The Bronze God of Rhodes.&quot;

Alfred Duggan&#x27;s novel on the life of Demetrius, &quot;Elephants and Castles&quot;, also covers the siege.

The fifth novel in Christian Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Tyrant&quot; series, &quot;Destroyer of Cities&quot;, features the siege of Rhodes.

Emma Lazarus wrote a poem contrasting the Statue of Liberty to Colossus titled &quot;The New Colossus.&quot;

In the 1994 general election most FdL members supported Patto Segni, while Biondi (and some of the Liberals gathered in the Union of the Centre) were elected with Forza Italia. The FdL failed to file lists for the subsequent European Parliament election.

In 1995 the party was joined by the Liberal Democratic Union, whose leader Valerio Zanone was elected president, replacing Antonio Baslini.

In the 1996 general election Zanone and Morelli sided the FdL with The Olive Tree and, more specifically, with Democratic Union. In the 1999 European Parliament election the party formed a joint list with the Italian Republican Party. In both cases no Liberals were elected.

In the 2001 general election the FdL sided with Democracy is Freedom (DL). Zanone, a keen supporter of that alliance, joined DL&#x27;s national board in 2002 and was elected to the Senate in the 2006 general election, while Morelli was more critical. The majority of the party sided with the latter, but the final fracture with Zanone happened only in 2005. In the meantime, in the 2004 European Parliament election the FdL had formed joint lists with the Federation of Liberal Democrats.

After that, the party, which is still active and more recently took part in European Choice for the 2014 European Parliament election, has suffered a steady decline.

<text>Italy of Values (, IdV) is a populist and anti-corruption political party in Italy. The party was founded in 1998 by former &quot;Mani pulite&quot; prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro, who entered politics in 1996 and finally left the party in 2014. IdV has aimed at gathering and giving voice to different sectors of the Italian society. From the beginning of its existence one of its major issues has been the so-called &quot;moral issue&quot;. In the early 2010s, IdV was eclipsed by the new-born Five Star Movement, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, which used the same populist and anti-corruption rhetoric.

==History==
===Background and formation (1996–2001)===
Antonio Di Pietro was minister of Public Works in the Prodi I Cabinet from May to November 1996, when he resigned because he was under investigation in Brescia. In November 1997 Di Pietro was elected senator for The Olive Tree in a by-election in Mugello, a stronghold of the Democrats of the Left (DS) in Tuscany, with 67.7% of the vote, much more than centre-right independent Giuliano Ferrara (16.1%) and Communist Sandro Curzi (13.0%).

In March 1998, Di Pietro established Italy of Values (IdV), alongside Willer Bordon of the Democratic Union and Rino Piscitello and Franco Danieli of The Network, led by Leoluca Orlando (a future IdV member).

In February 1999, Di Pietro integrated IdV into The Democrats, a new centrist party founded by Romano Prodi with the goal of transforming The Olive Tree coalition in a single &quot;Democratic&quot; party. In the 1999 European Parliament election The Democrats scored 7.7% and Di Pietro was elected MEP. He was also appointed organisational secretary and Senate floor leader of the party. In April 2000, Di Pietro abruptly left in opposition to the appointment of Giuliano Amato, a long-time member of the Italian Socialist Party (which was the main subject of investigation of Di Pietro as prosecutor), as Prime Minister of Italy after the resignation of Massimo D&#x27;Alema. Shortly afterwards, Di Pietro set up IdV again.

IdV took part to the 2001 general election as a stand-alone party on a populist platform, which included tough management of illegal immigration and protest against waste of public money. IdV&#x27;s campaign was focused principally against Silvio Berlusconi, who was the candidate for Prime Minister of the House of Freedoms (CdL) centre-right coalition. IdV won 3.9% in the election, 0.1% short of the 4% threshold, and obtained no seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The party elected one senator, Valerio Carrara, but, after a few days from the election, he surprisingly switched to Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia (FI) party, leaving IdV without parliamentary representation for the next five years.

===From isolation to electoral success (2001–2009)===
In the 2004 European Parliament election Di Pietro teamed up with Achille Occhetto, a former leader of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), under the banner &quot;Civil Society Di Pietro–Occhetto&quot;. The electoral list gained 2.1% of the national vote and both men were elected MEPs. After the election, Occhetto immediately renounced to his seat and was replaced by Giulietto Chiesa, a communist journalist, who sat with the Party of European Socialists Group.

In 2005 IdV joined The Union, a new centre-left coalition led by Prodi, who won the primary election with 74.2% of the vote, defeating also Di Pietro (3.3%). In early 2006 Leoluca Orlando, former mayor of Palermo, some splinters from the Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), including Pino Pisicchio and Egidio Pedrini, and former DS such as Fabio Evangelisti and Federico Palomba, joined the party, in an effort of broadening its electoral base.

The Union narrowly won the 2006 general election, IdV scored a mere 2.1% and Di Pietro was sworn in as Minister of Infrastructures in the Prodi II Cabinet.

After the fall of Prodi&#x27;s government, Di Pietro formed an alliance with the Democratic Party (PD) for the 2008 general election. The coalition was defeated by Berlusconi&#x27;s centre-right, but IdV obtained 4.4% of the vote, 29 deputies and 14 senators. Following the election, IdV formed its own groups in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, instead of joining the Democrats in a joint group as promised, and started a competition with its main ally. In October 2008, Veltroni, who distanced from Di Pietro many times, declared that &quot;on some issues he [Di Pietro] is distant from the democratic language of the centre-left&quot;; however, the PD decided to support Carlo Costantini (IdV) in the 2008 regional election in Abruzzo. Costantini was defeated, but in the event IdV came close to the PD (15.0%–19.6%).

In the 2009 European Parliament election the list got 8.0% of the national vote, quadrupling the votes obtained five years before and gaining 7 seats. In the run-up for the election Di Pietro recruited to run in IdV lists Pino Arlacchi, a former senator for the DS, Gianni Vattimo, a left-wing philosopher, Maurizio Zipponi, a former trade unionist and deputy of the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), and Luigi de Magistris, a left-wing former prosecutor of Catanzaro who inquired Romano Prodi. Arlacchi, De Magistris and Vattimo were all elected to the European Parliament. From the results of the European election, IdV was the fourth largest party in the country.

Following these results, Di Pietro said that IdV &quot;will remove his name from the symbol of the party, in order to build something larger, more useful and that represents something more important&quot;. He also said that &quot;we need to become a great progressive party that supports a proposal for a credible government&quot;. The party&#x27;s executive decided not to remove the name of its founder, considering that name still too important for the party.

===Populist turn and discontents (2009–2013)===

Since de Magistris&#x27;s strong showing in the 2009 European election there was talk of an underground row between him and Di Pietro for the leadership of the party. Moreover, as some members of the party were entailed with corruption charges, others like Francesco Barbato urged Di Pietro to be more earnest in cleaning up the party. De Magistris, keen on aligning the party with the far left and the most radical groups in opposition to Berlusconi, dubbed Di Pietro as too moderate and denounced that the party &quot;risks of becoming the DC of the third millennium&quot;. While the party&#x27;s grassroots supported a change of leadership and de Magistris initially did not rule this out, the party&#x27;s old guard (Silvana Mura, Massimo Donadi, Felice Belisario, Luigi Li Gotti and Leoluca Orlando) staunchly defended the leader. Finally an agreement was reached between the two: during 5–7 February 2010 party congress de Magistris would support Di Pietro in exchange of a leading role in the party. In any event Di Pietro was re-elected as party president unopposed, while de Magistris did not become party secretary as he wanted.

The populist course taken by the party, that enforced its co-operation with the far left, and the emergence of more &quot;extreme&quot; figures like de Magistris led Pino Pisicchio and his centrist faction to leave the party in order to join Francesco Rutelli&#x27;s Alliance for Italy (ApI) in November 2009. While leaving the party along with other three MPs, Pisicchio told the press that lining up IdV in the &quot;antagonist camp&quot; was a departure from its original nature of a &quot;centrist party of liberal-democratic inspiration&quot;. Giuseppe Astore, a senator, offered similar views: &quot;De Magistris is too far on the left for me ... . I want a reformist not an extremist party&quot;. In the summer of 2010 two MEPs, Arlacchi and Vincenzo Iovine, left IdV citing the lack of democracy in the party. Arlacchi, a former senator of the PDS, joined the PD, while Iovine, a former Christian Democrat, the ApI. In December two deputies, Antonio Razzi and Domenico Scilipoti, left the party in order to support Berlusconi&#x27;s government.

In early 2011 IdV proposed three referendums. Thanks to its activists, the party was able to collect two million signatures among the Italian population in support of these referendums, which were concerned with the abrogation of the so-called &quot;legittimo impedimento&quot; (an Italian law which permits the Prime Minister to postpone potential trials if prosecuted by the judiciary), the abrogation of a law allowing the construction of nuclear power plants in Italy and the abrogation of a law allowing the privatisation of water management. The referendums took place in June 2011 and the &quot;yes&quot; prevailed in all three cases.

On 30 May 2011 de Magistris was elected mayor of Naples by a landslide. The IdV candidate, who had received just 27.5% of the vote in the first round (enough to beat the Democratic candidate off the second round), won a thumping 65.4% of the vote against the centre-right candidate in the run-off. This was a huge success for IdV and its main ally, the Federation of the Left, which together also gained the majority in the municipal council. On 21 May 2012 the party had another major electoral breakthrough when Leoluca Orlando was elected mayor of Palermo with 72.4% of the vote in a run-off. Both mayors would distance from IdV in a few years.

In October 2012 IdV came under pressure after some news inquiries reported obscurities in party finances, while suffering heavy losses in opinion polls due to the success of a new protest party led by comedian Beppe Grillo, the Five Star Movement (M5S). In an interview to &quot;Il Fatto Quotidiano&quot;, Di Pietro declared IdV &quot;dead&quot; and, foreseeing its exclusion from Parliament after the next election, stated that the party would fight from the outside and would endorse the M5S. Grillo proposed Di Pietro as President of the Republic, but ruled out any alliance between M5S and IdV. The interview caused unrest within party ranks and led to the exit of a &quot;moderate&quot; wing led by Massimo Donadi, who was replaced as floor leader in the Chamber by Antonio Borghesi. Donadi, along with other three deputies (Nello Formisano, Giovanni Paladini and Gaetano Porcino) and one senator (Stefano Pedica), launched Rights and Freedom (DL), which later joined the Democratic Centre (CD).

In October 2012, de Magistris quit the party and formed the Orange Movement (MA), which was joined by many IdV left-wingers. As soon as late December, both IdV and MA were founding components of Civil Revolution (RC), a far-left coalition led by Antonio Ingroia.

===Decline and re-organisation (2013–present)===
In the 2013 general election RC won a mere 2.2% of the vote and IdV was thus out of Parliament for the first time in almost ten years.

After RC&#x27;s debacle, Di Pietro resigned from party president. On 13 May Di Pietro, on behalf of the party&#x27;s executive, announced that the experience of RC was over for IdV and that the party would elect a new leader during a congress to be held in June. In the meantime, Leoluca Orlando, Felice Belisario, Carlo Costantini and other leading members of IdV left the party to launch the 139 Movement (139 being the number of the articles of the Italian Constitution).

In the 2014 European election, IdV received just 0.65% of the vote, losing the party&#x27;s remaining representation in the European Parliament.

In the party congress, convened for 28–30 June, delegates chose the new leader, a secretary instead of a president, among five candidates: Antonio Borghesi, Matteo Castellarin, Ignazio Messina, Niccolò Rinaldi and Nicola Scalera. In the last ballot Messina was elected with 69.1% of the vote over Rinaldi, who had received the endorsements of Borghesi, Castellarin and Scalera. In October Di Pietro left the party altogether.

Since 2015 the party was joined by three senators (Alessandra Bencini, Maurizio Romani and Francesco Molinari) and saw the return of a deputy (Formisano). In 2017, Formisano left again in order to join the Democratic and Progressive Movement (MDP), which was also joined by Di Pietro.

In December 2017 IdV was a founding member of the Popular Civic List (CP), a centrist electoral list within the centre-left coalition, along with Popular Alternative (AP), the Centrists for Europe (CpE), Solidary Democracy (DemoS), the Union for Trentino (UpT), Italy Is Popular (IP), and minor parties/groups.

In the 2018 general election, CP obtained 0.5% and no seats, and IdV was again excluded from Parliament.

In 2022, Ignazio Messina announced the federation of IdV with Us with Italy and the support for Us Moderates (a centrist list within the centre-right coalition) in the 2022 general election.

==Ideology and factions==
While the party had been generally aligned with the centre-left, its members had been very diverse ideologically, ranging from the far left (i.e. Franca Rame, a former member of &quot;Soccorso Rosso&quot;, and Pancho Pardi, a former activist of &quot;Potere Operaio&quot;) to the right, thanks to the populist message of the party. The party includes former Communists and former LN members, as well as former MSI members and several former Christian Democrats. According to 2009 a study by Pino Pisicchio, a political scientist who was then deputy of IdV, 57.1% of the party&#x27;s MPs were former Christian Democrats or members of post-Christian Democratic parties (including 11.9% from the UDEUR), 9.5% were former Communists, 4.8% came from far-left parties and movements, 2.4% were former MSI members and 2.4% former LN members.

The party is a supporter of legality, law and order, the police forces, first-past-the-post voting, federalism, corporate reform, lowering the costs of politics, improving the efficiency of public services, fighting corruption, simplifying trials bureaucracy to achieve faster verdicts and regulating conflict of interest.

During the Prodi II Cabinet IdV was one of the most centrist voices in the centre-left coalition and sometimes, despite its harsh criticism of Berlusconi, it switched sides in Parliament on some key issues. At some point, Di Pietro even proposed an electoral alliance between its party, the UDEUR and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), while ruling out any future alliance with the far left. Also during the Berlusconi IV Cabinet, IdV supported some plans of the government, notably the introduction of fiscal federalism; however, due to its uncompromising &quot;anti-berlusconismo&quot;, IdV has been at times very popular among left-wing voters, a fact that was highlighted also by the increasing number of communists in party ranks and often forms stable alliances with the parties of the far left at the local level, such as in the case of Luigi de Magistris&#x27; election as mayor of Naples or in the 2012 regional election in Sicily. The shift to the left embodied by the emergence of figures like de Magistris and Franco Grillini (honorary president of Arcigay, who joined in November 2009). was criticised by Pisicchio because, in his view, it was endangering the centrist nature of the party. The party has also continued to recruit people on the right, such as Alessandro Cè, a social-conservative former member of Lega Nord.

The fact that IdV was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, formerly known as European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), does not mean that it is a liberal party. Notwithstanding its former European affiliation, the party has rarely been regarded as liberal in Italy due to its &quot;justicialist&quot; and &quot;populist&quot; tendencies; the party&#x27;s character is that of a &quot;protest party&quot; and it opposes many policies generally supported by liberals. On the left, Di Pietro is described as a right-wing populist by Fausto Bertinotti, as well as by some political commentators. According to &quot;Panorama&quot;, the reason for these bitter comments by Bertinotti is that Di Pietro is very able to attract votes from the far-left electorate, as well as the right, and this could prevent a resurgence of those parties which were driven out of Parliament in the 2008 general election. During a council meeting in Rome, ELDR President Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck underlined that European Liberals are honored to have IdV as one of its Italian member parties as it exemplifies a political party of integrity and high quality politics. Di Pietro added that &quot;ELDR as the common house of European Liberals is the political home for us in terms of common convictions and a strong support for the cause of political freedoms in Italy&quot;. During the 2010 party congress, Di Pietro remarked IdV&#x27;s liberal identity and denounced what he called &quot;Berlusconi&#x27;s false liberalism&quot;.

In May 2012, IdV became the first Italian political party to announce publicly that it would push for marriage equality. Di Pietro said: &quot;Our party has been the first in Italy to follow U.S. president Barack Obama. We invite other Italian parties to support gay marriage. You don&#x27;t have to be shy, you have to say yes&quot;.

==Popular support==
The 2001–2010 electoral results in the 10 most populated regions of Italy, plus Abruzzo and Molise (the party&#x27;s main strongholds), are shown in the table below. Generally speaking, the party is stronger in the South than in the North, where the protest vote is absorbed primarily by Lega Nord.

<doc id="859608" wikidata="Q5972087" url="?curid=859608" title="IMP (programming language)">
<text>IMP is an early systems programming language that was developed by Edgar T. Irons in the late 1960s through early 1970s, at the National Security Agency (NSA). Unlike most other systems languages, IMP supports syntax-extensible programming.

Even though , IMP excludes many &quot;defining&quot; features of that language, while supporting a very non-ALGOL-like one: syntax extensibility.

A compiler for IMP existed as early as 1965 and was used to program the CDC 6600 time-sharing system, which was in use at the Institute for Defense Analyses since 1967. Although the compiler is slower than comparable ones for non-extensible languages, it has been used for practical production work.

IMP compilers were developed for the CDC 6600, Cray, PDP-10 and PDP-11 computers. Important IMP versions were IMP65, IMP70, and IMP72.

==Extensible syntax in IMP72==
Being an extensible syntax programming language, IMP allows a programmer to extend its syntax, although no specific means are provided to add new data types or structures to it. To achieve its syntax-extensibility, IMP uses a powerful parse algorithm based on a syntax graph and several connectivity matrices. The programmer may add new Backus–Naur form (BNF) productions to the graph.

IMP72&#x27;s syntax is extended by means of extended-BNF &quot;syntax statements&quot; included in a source code program. The mechanism is so powerful, that it allowed the implementation of the language by itself, i.e., by an IMP72 source file consisting entirely of syntax statements, which was input to a trivial compiler which was initially able to translate the simplest case of the syntax statement. There is also a simple form of the syntax statement which looks like a macro to the casual user.

Basically, the syntax statement is an augmented BNF production with associated semantics added on the right:

 &lt;class&gt; ::= syntax-part ::= semantic-part

For example, to add the construct described by the following BNF:

 &lt;EXP&gt; ::= INCREMENT &lt;VBL&gt;

with the semantics that codice_1 should translate to codice_2, the programmer would only need to insert the following &quot;IMP statement&quot;:

 &lt;EXP&gt; ::= INCREMENT &lt;VBL,A&gt; ::= &quot;A←A+1&quot;

The semantic-part can also contain calls to &quot;semantic routines&quot;, as in the following syntax statement:

 &lt;ATOM&gt; ::= ABS ( &lt;ATOM,A&gt; ) ::= DEWOP(214B,AREG1(1,13),A)

The semantic part of this statement consists of a call on the semantic routine codice_3. The arguments are the octal constant codice_4, the semantic routine call codice_5, and codice_6, which is the object on top of the stack at the moment this production is invoked. codice_3 is a semantic routine which respectively takes as its arguments a PDP-10 machine language opcode, a register object, and any other object, and produces an object whose value is the result of executing the designated machine instruction using as address field the object which is its last argument. In this example, the opcode codice_4 designates the codice_9 instruction, and thus the result of the above syntax statement will be to compile code to compute the absolute value of codice_6.

<text>Inglewood is a rural town and locality in the Goondiwindi Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Inglewood had a population of 936 people.

== Geography ==

The town sits on the southern Darling Downs midway between the larger centres of Warwick and Goondiwindi on the Cunningham Highway. It is south-west of Toowoomba. The Inglewood–Texas Road runs to the south. The Millmerran–Inglewood Road (State Route 82) runs to the north.

It is part of the Border Rivers region of waterways. The confluence of the Macintyre Brook and Canning Creek is sited just north of Inglewood, with the brook running 270° around the town.

Olive growing is a comparatively new industry in the area. Other established industries include sheep and cattle raising, grain growing and timber harvesting. Tobacco growing was common around Inglewood over the last 60 years.

== History ==
Bigambul (also known as Bigambal, Bigumbil, Pikambul, Pikumbul) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bigambul people. The Bigambul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Goondiwindi Regional Council, including the towns of Goondiwindi, Yelarbon and Texas extending north towards Moonie and Millmerran.

English botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham has been credited with being the first European to discover the Inglewood area. He passed through east of the present township in May 1827. The first settlement in the area was known as Browns Inn and was an important watering point for bullock teams moving west. The inn opened in the late 1850s on the south side of Macintyre Brook.

In April 1862, a town was surveyed by L.F. Landsbergon on the higher northern side of Macintyre Book. Plans were drawn up for the present site and the name changed from Pariagna to Inglewood by Landsberg using a compound word &quot;ingol&quot; (an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;cypress pine&quot;) and the English word &quot;wood&quot; referring to a clump of trees on the northern side of the brook.

Inglewood Post Office opened on 16 September 1866. Most of the hinterland consisted of station holdings which were selected as early as 1848 and were the start of the wool, cattle and wheat base of the region.

Inglewood State School opened on 13 February 1872 as a primary with a secondary department opened on 25 January 1960.

An Anglican church opened in 1894.

A Catholic church opened in 1902.

Whetstone Provisional School opened on 19 July 1904 and became Whetstone State School on 1 January 1909. In 1910, it was renamed Inglewood West State School. It suffered from low student numbers and consequently closed and re-opened a number of times, closing finally in 1928. It was on a site on the northern side of the Cunningham Highway in Inglewood ().

Inglewood Presbyterian Church was officially opened and dedicated by Reverend Richard Kerr on Sunday 30 September 1906.

The Thane-to Inglewood section of the South Western railway line opened on 8 July 1907, with Inglewood being served by the Inglewood railway station. The station was originally called &#x27;Pariagna&#x27; but the name was changed to Inglewood when the town&#x27;s name changed. The next section from Inglewood to Goondiwindi was completed on 13 October 1908.

Nine years later Inglewood became a rail junction when the line to Texas was opened. It carried freight, including fuel to, and ore from, the Silverspur mine east of Texas. The Texas rail line was closed in 1994, due to lack of passengers and the usage of trucks to move freight. Local dairying was served by a branch factory of the Warwick Co-operative between 1940 and 1960.

A hospital was built in 1921.

In 1925, Pugh&#x27;s Queensland Directory recorded four hotels in Inglewood, two sawmills, a picture show and several other stores and tradespeople.

On 16 February 1922, the Inglewood War Memorial was dedicated by the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for the Carnarvon, Major Edward Costello, as part of at the official opening of the Inglewood Memorial Hospital.

St Maria Goretti&#x27;s School opened on 5 February 1951 by the Sisters of St Joseph after having been blessed by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Toowoomba, Joseph Basil Roper on 28 January 1951. The school was named in honour of St Maria Goretti, an Italian girl who had been canonised in 1950 and a popular choice of the Italian immigrant families of the district. The school had 51 students in its first year.

Coolmunda Dam was built in 1968, where there was previously the Coolmunda School.

The Inglewood Public Library building was opened in 1996 with a minor refurbishment in 2011.

<doc id="859611" wikidata="Q1141788" url="?curid=859611" title="Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy">
<text>Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy (, DL), commonly known simply as The Daisy (&quot;La Margherita&quot;), was a centrist political party in Italy. The party was formed from the merger of three parties within the centre-left coalition: the Italian People&#x27;s Party, The Democrats and Italian Renewal. The party president and leader was Francesco Rutelli, former mayor of Rome and prime ministerial candidate during the 2001 general election for The Olive Tree coalition, within which The Daisy electoral list won 14.5% of the national vote.

The Daisy became a single party in February 2002. It was set up by former left-leaning Christian Democrats, centrists, social-liberals (former Liberals and former Republicans), as well as other left-wing politicians from the former Italian Socialist Party and Federation of the Greens.

On 14 October 2007, DL merged with the Democrats of the Left to form the Democratic Party (PD).

==History==
The idea of uniting the centrist components of The Olive Tree, which were divided in many parties, was discussed at least from 1996. In the 1996 general election, there were actually two centrist lists within the Italian centre-left coalition: the Populars for Prodi, an electoral list including the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI), Democratic Union (UD), the Italian Republican Party (PRI) and the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party (SVP), and that of Italian Renewal (RI), including the Segni Pact (PS) and Italian Socialists (SI), which later merged into the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI) in 1998. In 1998 splinters from the centre-right coalition formed the Democratic Union for the Republic (UDR), later transformed into Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), to support the D&#x27;Alema I Cabinet. In 1999 splinters of PPI, UD and other groups formed The Democrats (Dem).

Between 1998 and 2000, there were several precursors of such idea at the regional and local level in Northeast Italy, notably the Reformist Popular Centre in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the Daisy Civic List in Trentino, the Autonomist Federation in Aosta Valley and Together for Veneto in Veneto. Initially some of these experiments were intended to include both Christian-inspired parties and secular ones, such as SDI and PRI. However, on 12 October 2000, only PPI, Dem, UDEUR and RI agreed to join forces with a joint list called &quot;The Daisy&quot; for the 2001 general election. The Daisy, led by Francesco Rutelli (who was also candidate for Prime Minister for the whole centre-left), won 14.5% of the vote, only two points less than the Democrats of the Left (DS).

Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy was established as a single party during the founding congress of Parma in March 2002. On that occasion the Italian People&#x27;s Party, The Democrats and Italian Renewal merged to form the new party, while the UDEUR decided to remain separate.

In the 2006 general election, The Daisy was member of the victorious alliance The Union, and won 39 out of 315 senators. The Olive Tree list, of which DL was a member since the 2004 European Parliament election, won 220 seats out of 630 in the Chamber of Deputies. On 14 October 2007, DL, DS and numerous minor parties merged to form the Democratic Party (PD), a unitary centre-left party in anticipation of a move to a two-party system.

==Ideology==
Democracy Is Freedom was a pro-European centrist party, with a strong support among Catholics, especially progressive ones: the party was described as &quot;social Christian&quot;. The party put together social conservatives with social progressives, economic liberals and social democrats. Many former members of the Italian People&#x27;s Party, one of the ancestor parties of DL, were members or close supporters of the Italian Confederation of Workers&#x27; Trade Unions (CISL), the Catholic trade union.

After the 2004 European elections the new party decided not to become a member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR) or of the European People&#x27;s Party, but founded the European Democratic Party (EDP) together with the Union for French Democracy. In the European Parliament, the EDP and ELDR European parties established the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group (ALDE).

In 2005, DL participated in the foundation of the Alliance of Democrats, a worldwide network of centrist parties, along with the New Democrat Coalition of the United States Democratic Party, the EDP member parties and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats.

==Members==
Leading members of the party included:
*Former Christian Democrats: Gerardo Bianco, Rosy Bindi, Enzo Carra, Pierluigi Castagnetti, Luigi Cocilovo, Sergio D&#x27;Antoni, Ciriaco De Mita, Giuseppe Fioroni, Dario Franceschini, Enrico Letta, Renzo Lusetti, Nicola Mancino, Franco Marini, Sergio Mattarella, Lapo Pistelli, Vittorio Prodi, Rosa Russo Jervolino, Patrizia Toia
*Former Socialists: Laura Fincato, Giuseppe La Ganga, Linda Lanzillotta, Enrico Manca, Pierluigi Mantini, Tiziano Treu
*Former Social Democrats: Franco Bruno, Andrea Papini, Italo Tanoni
*Former Liberals: Cinzia Dato, Natale D&#x27;Amico, Lamberto Dini, Valerio Zanone
*Former Republicans: Enzo Bianco, Sandro Gozi, Antonio Maccanico, Roberto Manzione
*Former Radicals: Francesco Rutelli, Roberto Giachetti
*Former Greens: Paolo Gentiloni, Ermete Realacci, Francesco Rutelli, Gianni Vernetti
*Former Communists: Willer Bordon, Massimo Cacciari, Maurizio Fistarol, Antonio Polito

==Factions==
DL was mainly composed of four factions, the first three of them supporting Francesco Rutelli&#x27;s leadership:
*Rutelliani. Rutelli&#x27;s own group, composed of Paolo Gentiloni, Roberto Giachetti, Renzo Lusetti, Ermete Realacci, Gianni Vernetti, Luigi Lusi, Rino Piscitello, Maurizio Fistarol and Riccardo Villari. This group was supportive of the idea of forming a &#x27;Democratic Party&#x27; with DS, but they wanted to model it on the United States Democratic Party and for this reason they supported the foundation of the European Democratic Party. Many &quot;Rutelliani&quot;, including Francesco Rutelli himself, eventually left the Democratic Party to found the Alliance for Italy on 11 November 2009.
*Popolari. This group represented the core of the former Italian People&#x27;s Party (a leftist Christian democratic party), as Franco Marini, Ciriaco De Mita, Pierluigi Castagnetti, Gerardo Bianco, Nicola Mancino, Enrico Letta, Dario Franceschini, Giuseppe Fioroni, Rosy Bindi, Lapo Pistelli and Sergio D&#x27;Antoni. This group supported Rutelli as leader of the party, although there were some differences about the future Democratic Party with DS, as &quot;Popolari&quot; were proud of their supposedly Christian-democratic identity and some of them preferred to re-join the European People&#x27;s Party, rejecting the idea of joining the Party of European Socialists.
*Teodem. This was a group of socially conservative Christian democrats, formed by Paola Binetti, Luigi Bobba, Enzo Carra, Patrizia Toia, Emanuela Baio Dossi and Marco Calgaro. Usually considered the right wing of the party, they supported Rutelli as leader of the party.
*Ulivisti. This group represented the core of the former Democrats, as Arturo Parisi, Enzo Bianco, Willer Bordon, Antonio Maccanico, Franco Monaco, Pierluigi Mantini, Marina Magistrelli, Roberto Manzione, Cinzia Dato and Giovanni Procacci. This group, very close to Romano Prodi, was the most supportive of the Democratic Party project and tended to be more secular, although most of its members had Catholic connections.

==Popular support==
The electoral results of Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy in the 10 most populated regions of Italy are shown in the table below. As DL was founded in 2002, the electoral results from 1994 to 2001 refer to the combined result of the precursor parties.

The results of 1994 (general) refer to the combined result of PPI, Segni Pact and AD, those of 1994 to the combined result of PPI and Pact of Democrats (joint-list of Segni Pact and AD, including also SI), those of 1996 (general and Sicilian regional) to the combined result of the joint-list of PPI and UD and RI (whose list was composed of the Segni Pact and SI), those of 1999 (European) and 2000 (regional) to the combined result of PPI, Dem and RI, those of 2001 (general and Sicilian regional) the DL federation (comprising at the time PPI, Dem, UDEUR and RI).

From 2004 (European) the results refer to DL, formed by PPI, Dem and RI, after the defection of UDEUR. The result for the 2006 general election refers to the election for the Senate, indeed DL contested the election for the Chamber of Deputies in a joint list with Democrats of the Left.

<text>The Italian Republican Party (, PRI) is a political party in Italy established in 1895, which makes it the oldest political party still active in the country. The PRI identifies with 19th-century classical radicalism, as well as Mazzinianism, and its modern incarnation is associated with liberalism, social liberalism, and centrism. The PRI has old roots and a long history that began with a left-wing position, being the heir of the Historical Far Left and claiming descent from the political thought of Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi. With the rise of the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) to its left, it was associated with centre-left politics. The early PRI was also known for its anti-clerical, anti-monarchist, republican, and later anti-fascist stances. While maintaining those traits, during the second half of the 20th century the party moved towards the centre on the left–right political spectrum, becoming increasingly economically liberal.

After 1949, the PRI was a member of the pro-NATO alliance formed by Christian Democracy (DC), the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, and the Italian Liberal Party (PLI), enabling it to participate in most governments of the 1950s, a period later known as Centrism. In 1963, the party helped bring together DC and PSI in Italy&#x27;s first centre-left government, the Organic centre-left. Although small in terms of voter support, the PRI was influential thanks to leaders like Eugenio Chiesa, Giovanni Conti, Cipriano Facchinetti, Randolfo Pacciardi, Oronzo Reale, Ugo La Malfa, Bruno Visentini, Oddo Biasini and Giovanni Spadolini. The latter served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1981–1982, the first non Christian Democrat since 1945. From 1976 to 2010, the PRI was a member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), along with the PLI, and the two parties usually ran together in European Parliament elections. After joining the centrist Segni Pact in 1994, the PRI was part of the centre-left coalition from 1996 to 2006, and then of the centre-right coalition from 2008 to 2013 (its leader Giorgio La Malfa was minister in 2005–2006). Afterwards, it ran alone until joining the centrist Action – Italia Viva in 2022.

== History ==
=== Background and foundation ===
The PRI traces its origins from the time of Italian unification and more specifically to the democratic-republican wing represented by figures such as Giuseppe Mazzini, Carlo Cattaneo and Carlo Pisacane. They were against the so-called &quot;piemontesizzazione&quot; of Italy, meaning the conquest by war of the Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont) of the rest of Italy.

After the latter was unified under the Savoy kings, following the political lines of moderates such as Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Republicans remained aside from the political life of the new country, proclaiming their abstention from elections. They created several democratic movements, like the Brotherhood Pact of Workers&#x27; Societies, founded by Mazzini in 1871. However, Mazzini&#x27;s death the following year and internationalism put the Republicans in a difficult position.

In the run-up of the 1880 Italian general election, the Republicans chose to abandon abstentionism. At the time, their ranks included both members of the middle class, such as Giovanni Bovio, Arcangelo Ghisleri and Napoleone Colajanni, as well as the working class, such as Valentino Armirotti. The PRI, whose power base was limited to Romagna, Umbria, Marche, the Tuscan littoral and Lazio, all but Tuscany former Papal States territories, was officially founded in 1895. By the end of the century, the party was allied with the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and the Italian Radical Party in several local governments, including Milan, Florence and Rome.

=== Early 20th century ===

In 1904 the Republican Youth Federation was formed in Terni.

At the outbreak of World War I, the PRI sided with interventionists, aiming at supporting France (considered the motherland of human rights) and annexing Trento and Trieste (then part of Austria-Hungary). After the end of the conflict, the party tried to form an alliance with other left-wing parties, but the attempt failed as the PSI at was strongly influenced by its &quot;maximalist&quot; (radical) wing. In 1921, Pietro Nenni left the PRI to become one of the leaders of the PSI. In the 1920s, the rise of the National Fascist Party (PNF) caused the collapse of all Italian left-wing parties, including the PRI, which was banned in 1926.

Several Republicans were arrested, confined or exiled and the PRI collaborated to the anti-fascist struggle. In 1927, the party joined Anti-fascist Concentration. In the late 1930s, it also participated in the Spanish Civil War. In 1940, the German occupation of France, where many Republicans had taken refuge, put the party in jeopardy. During the armed resistance against the German occupation of Italy from 1943, PRI members were part of the provincial National Liberation Committees (CLN), but they did not participate to the national CLN as they did not want to collaborate with Italian monarchists, some of whom were active members of the committee.

=== Post-World War II ===

In 1946, the PRI gained 4.4% of the popular vote in the election for a Constituent Assembly, confirming its traditional strongholds. However, it was very weak if compared to Christian Democracy (DC) and the Italian Communist Party (PCI). After that, a ballot on the same day abolished monarchy in Italy and the PRI declared itself available to take a role in the government of Italy, entering the second government of Alcide De Gasperi. In late 1946, Ugo La Malfa and Ferruccio Parri, formerly members of the Action Party (PdA), moved to the PRI. La Malfa would be appointed as minister in several of the following governments.

At the 19th congress of the party held in 1947, there were two main inner trends: one, represented by the national secretary Randolfo Pacciardi, supported an alliance with the PCI; the other, led by Giovanni Conti and Cipriano Facchinetti, considered the PCI the cause of the government&#x27;s lack of efficiency. The latter was to prevail. Carlo Sforza, a Republican, was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the De Gasperi III Cabinet, although only as an independent. Sforza signed the treaty of peace and contributed to the entrance of Italy into the Marshall Plan, NATO and the Council of Europe. The exclusion of left-wing parties from the government in 1947 led the PRI to join the De Gasperi IV Cabinet. Pacciardi refused to take a position as minister. As the PCI became ever closer to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Pacciardi later changed his mind and became Deputy Prime Minister.

The 1948 Italian general election saw the PRI as a solid ally of the DC, but also a reduction of the party&#x27;s share to 2.5%. In the following years, the strongest party faction was that of La Malfa, who refused to participate to the DC-led governments until 1962.

In 1963, the party voted in favour of the first centre-left government in Italy led by Aldo Moro. Pacciardi, who had voted against, was expelled and founded a separate movement, Democratic Union for the New Republic (UDNR), whose electoral result were disappointing and whose members had largely returned to the PRI by the late 1960s (although Pacciardi, who received much criticism at this time for his association with coup plotters and neo-fascists, did not come back until after the UDNR was disbanded in 1980). La Malfa was elected national secretary in 1965. The alliance with the DC ended in 1974 when the Republicans left over disagreements on budgetary policy.

=== &quot;Pentapartito&quot; age ===

In 1979, La Malfa received by President Sandro Pertini the mandate to form a new government. It was the first time for a non-DC member since the Italian Republic had been created. The attempt failed and a new government led by Giulio Andreotti was formed, with La Malfa as Deputy Prime Minister, but he suddenly died five days later. In September, the PRI chose Giovanni Spadolini as national secretary and Bruno Visentini as president. The following twelve years, first under Spadolini and then under La Malfa&#x27;s son Giorgio, saw the PRI as a stable member of the so-called &quot;Pentapartito&quot;, an alliance between the DC, the PSI, the PRI, the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) and the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI) which governed Italy from 1983 to 1991. The PRI abandoned the coalition in 1991 in disagreement with the Mammì bill (named after Oscar Mammì, a Republican) on telecommunications.

In June 1981, Spadolini became Prime Minister of Italy (the first non-Christian Democrat to do so following 1945) and formed a five-party government, the Spadolini I Cabinet. Under Spadolini, an urgent decree outlawing all secret lodges, such as Propaganda Due (which included numerous members of previous governments and of military forces), was approved. The Spadolini II Cabinet fell in November 1983 due to a strife between Beniamino Andreatta (DC) and Rino Formica, Ministers of the Treasury and Finances respectively.

At the 1983 Italian general election, the PRI gained its best result ever (5.1%) thanks to Spadolini&#x27;s popularity after his stint as Prime Minister and became the third largest party after the DC and the PCI in several Italian cities, notably including Turin. Spadolini was Minister of Defence from 1983 to 1987 under Bettino Craxi (PSI). Following the 1987 Italian general election, Spadolini was elected president of the Senate (an office he would retain until 1994) and was replaced by Giorgio La Malfa as party leader.

=== Diaspora and re-organisation ===

The early-1990s &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; scandals destroyed the party which fell under 1% of the vote, making it dependent on alliances with other parties to survive under the new electoral system based on plurality. In 1992–1994, the PRI lost most of its voters and members. The party was divided in three groups: one led by Giorgio La Malfa joined the Pact for Italy, a second one led by Luciana Sbarbati joined Democratic Alliance (AD) and a third group left the party and formed Republican Left (SR). At the 1994 Italian general election, some PRI members including Sbarbati were elected to the Italian Parliament from the list of AD while Carla Mazzuca were the sole elected with the Segni Pact. At that time, the party seemed quite finished.

Many Republicans, including Jas Gawronski, Guglielmo Castagnetti, Alberto Zorzoli, Luigi Casero, Denis Verdini, Piergiorgio Massidda and Mario Pescante, left the PRI in order to join Forza Italia. Others, mostly affiliated to SR, including Giorgio Bogi, Stefano Passigli, Giuseppe Ayala, Andrea Manzella and Adolfo Battaglia, approached with the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and finally merged into the Democrats of the Left (DS) in 1998. Others, notably including Enzo Bianco and Antonio Maccanico, joined Democratic Union (UD), The Democrats (Dem) and finally Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy (DL). The party continued to exist under the leadership of La Malfa, who had been elected MEP for the ELDR Group at the 1994 European Parliament election in Italy and who worked hard to re-organise the party, welcoming back people such as Sbarbati who had left it in the wake of the 1994 general election.

=== From Prodi to Berlusconi ===
From 1996 to 2001, the PRI was part of The Olive Tree centre-left coalition led by Romano Prodi. At the 1996 Italian general election, the party elected two deputies (Giorgio La Malfa and Luciana Sbarbati) and two senators (Antonio Duva and Stelio De Carolis) thanks to the alliance with larger parties. Duva and De Carolis switched to the DS soon after the election, but during the legislature the PRI was joined by three more deputies elected with other parties: Gianantonio Mazzocchin, Giovanni Marongiu (both former DS members) and Luigi Negri (a former member of Lega Nord and Forza Italia). The Republicans were very disappointed by the five years of government of the centre-left and soon became critical supporters of the Prodi I Cabinet as part of The Clover, a centrist parliamentary alliance with the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI) and the Union for the Republic (UpR). The Clover was responsible for the fall of the D&#x27;Alema I Cabinet in December 1999.

At the 2001 Italian general election, the party formed an alliance with Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s House of Freedoms and got one deputy (Giorgio La Malfa) and one senator (Antonio Del Pennino) elected. This led two left-wing groups to secede from the party: the European Republicans Movement (MRE), led by Luciana Sbarbati; and the Democratic Republicans, led by Giuseppe Ossorio. The PRI took part to Berlusconi&#x27;s governments and La Malfa was appointed Minister of European Affairs in the Berlusconi III Cabinet.

At the 2006 Italian general election, Nucara and La Malfa were elected on the Forza Italia&#x27;s lists for the Chamber of Deputies while the party decided to run under its own banner for the Senate in some regions, obtaining little more than 0.1% of the vote. Del Pennino was elected senator on Forza Italia&#x27;s list.

At the 2008 Italian general election, the PRI got two deputies elected in the list of The People of Freedom (PdL): La Malfa and Nucara. At time, the party had 12,000 members.

=== Re-unification and recent events ===
The common battle in Parliament against electoral reform favoured a reconciliation between the MRE and the PRI. During the third congress of the MRE in February 2009, the two parties signed a joint declaration under which despite their different coalition allegiances, the two parties pledged to join forces in Parliament on some key issues such as civil liberties and freedom of research. In October, a joint committee was installed in order to reach an agreement of re-unification between the two parties. By February 2011, the MRE and Ossorio&#x27;s Democratic Republicans reunited with the PRI.

Another split loomed when La Malfa voted against the Berlusconi IV Cabinet and was suspended from the party in December 2010. Moreover, La Malfa along with Sbarbati (MRE) took part to the foundation of the New Pole for Italy (NPI) instead. In May 2011 La Malfa was finally expelled from the party. In June 2011, Del Pennino, who had been a PdL candidate in 2008, returned to the Senate after the death of a PdL senator. In January 2012, Ossorio replaced a Democrat in the Chamber and joined the PRI sub-group. In the 2013 Italian general election, the PRI contested the election locally as a stand-alone list and obtained negligible results.

In December 2013, Nucara resigned from secretary after more than twelve years at the top. He was replaced by two successive coordinators, Saverio Collura (from March 2014, when Nucara was contextually elected president, to December 2015) and Corrado De Rinaldis Saponaro (from January 2016).

In the 2014 European Parliament election in Italy, the PRI supported the European Choice electoral list, which won 0.7% of the vote and failed to elect any MEPs. In April 2016, the party joined forces with Act!, a splinter group from Lega Nord led by Flavio Tosi, whose sub-group in the Mixed Group of the Chamber of Deputies was named Act!–PRI. After Enrico Costa&#x27;s entry in August 2017, the sub-group was renamed Act!–PRI–Liberals.

In the run-up of the 2018 Italian general election, De Rinaldis Saponaro was elected secretary and an alliance with the Liberal Popular Alliance (ALA) was formed. The PRI–ALA list, which was composed of only Republican candidates, presented its slates in one third of the constituencies and obtained 0.1% of the vote.

In 2019, Giorgio La Malfa was welcomed back into the party&#x27;s fold. The PRI was part of More Europe (+E) at the 2019 European Parliament election. In 2020, the PRI formed a pact with Action (A), a political party led by Carlo Calenda. In the 2020 Marche regional election, the PRI allied with the centre-right; this caused the European Republicans Movement to again split away from the Party to pursue an alliance with the centre-left.

In 2021 Carlo Cottarelli, a former director of the International Monetary Fund, was chosen by the PRI, A, +E, the Liberal Democratic Alliance for Italy (ALI), and The Liberals to head of a scientific committee designed to elaborate of a joint political program. On the occasion of the 2022 Italian general election, the PRI, after having joined Civic Commitment (an electoral list led by Luigi Di Maio within the centre-left coalition) for a few days, joined forces with the Action – Italia Viva, which ran outside the two main electoral coalitions. The splitaway MRE opted to join the Democratic and Progressive Italy coalition instead.

In 2024 the PRI formed a federative pact with Action.

== Popular support ==
Throughout the Kingdom of Italy, the Republicans along with the other party of the far left, the Italian Radical Party, were strong especially among the rural workers in Romagna, in the Marche and around Rome. In the 1890s, they suffered from competition with the Italian Socialist Party for the single-seat constituencies of Emilia-Romagna, where both parties had their heartlands. However, at the 1900 Italian general election the PRI won 4.3% of the vote (7.3% in Lombardy, 9.6% in Emilia-Romagna, 15.0% in the Marche, 9.6% in Umbria and 7.2% in Apulia) and 29 seats from several regions of Italy, including also Veneto and Sicily, where they had some local strongholds. After that, the Republicans were reduced almost to their power base in Romagna and Northern Marche, where the party had more than 40% and where most of their deputies came from. That was why the party, which was little more than a regional party, lost many seats when proportional representation was introduced in 1919.

At the 1946 Italian general election, despite competition from the Action Party, which had a similar constituency and regional base, the PRI won 4.4% of the vote, with peaks in its traditional strongholds: around 21% in Romagna (32.5% in Forlì and 37.3% in Ravenna), 16.4% in the Marche (26.6% in Ancona and 32.9% in Jesi), 11.0% in Umbria and 15.2% in Lazio. However, the PRI soon lost its character as a mass party in those areas (although it retained some of its positions there), as the Italian Communist Party conquered many formerly Republican workers&#x27; votes and the party settled around 1–2% at the national level in the 1950s and 1960s.

In the 1970s, under the leadership of Giovanni Spadolini the Republicans gained support among educated middle-class voters, losing some ground in their traditional strongholds, but also increasing their share of vote elsewhere, notably in Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria, where they became a strong competitor to the Italian Liberal Party for the votes of entrepreneurs and professionals. This led to a gradual recovery in the party&#x27;s fortunes, which reached their highest peak at the 1983 Italian general election. Spadolini had been Prime Minister of Italy for two years by this point, and the party enjoyed a bounce which led it to the 5.1% of the vote. This time, the PRI did better in Piedmont (7.7%, 10.3% in Turin and 12.8% in Cuneo) and Lombardy (6.9%, 12.3% in Milan) than in Emilia-Romagna (5.1%) and the Marche (4.7%). The party did very well in its local strongholds, such as the Province of Forlì-Cesena (11.3%) and the Province of Ravenna (13.9%).

At the 1992 Italian general election, the last before the &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; scandals, the PRI won 4.4% of the vote (+0.7% from 1987) and increased its share of vote in the South. With the end of the First Republic, the party was severely diminished in term of votes and retreated to its traditional strongholds and in the South. After that, most Republicans from the Marche left the party to join the European Republicans Movement in 2001, and most Republicans from Campania switched to the Democratic Republicans. The PRI was left only with Romagna (where the local party is affiliated to the centre-left) and its new heartlands in Calabria and Sicily.

At the 2004 European Parliament election in Italy, the party formed a joint list with the new Italian Liberal Party and won 3.8% of the vote in Calabria, 1.0% in Sicily and 1.0% in Apulia. In 2008, the PRI gained a surprising 9.4% in the provincial election of Messina, Sicily. In Romagna, where it always retained its alliance with the centre-left, the party won the 4.2% of the vote in the provincial election of Forlì-Cesena in 2004 and 3.8% in Ravenna in 2006; and 6.1% in the Ravenna municipal election. In the 2011 local elections, the party was almost stable in Ravenna and its province (5.1% and 3.1%, respectively) and in Reggio Calabria and its province (3.1% and 4.1%), but it gained some ground in Naples (1.5%). In the 2012 municipal elections, the party won 6.5% in Brindisi. In 2016, the party won 4.4% in Ravenna.

<text>The North River of Tennessee is a major tributary of the Tellico River. It rises in the Unicoi Range, which are geologically related to the Smoky Mountains to the north, in Monroe County, Tennessee inside Cherokee National Forest. Its entire course is located in a very scenic, very isolated area; for the vast majority of its length it is parallel by Forest Road 217, also called North River Road, managed by the Forest Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. It flows very roughly east to west. There is a Forest Service campground located near its confluence with the Tellico, which is located upstream and opposite that of the Tellico&#x27;s other major tributary, the Bald River.

<text>Corallus, the neotropical tree boas, are a genus of boas found in Central America, South America and the West Indies. Nine extant species are recognized .

==Description==
All members of this genus are long, slightly flattened laterally and have thin bodies with large heads. They typically have relatively large eyes, although this is less pronounced in the larger species, such as the emerald tree boa, &quot;Corallus caninus&quot;. The anterior teeth are highly elongated, often being several times the length one would expect for snakes of their size. These are used for penetrating layers of feathers to get a firm grip on birds, their primary prey. All members of the genus are nocturnal and have large numbers of very pronounced thermoreceptive pits are located between the labial scales.

==Distribution and habitat==
Species in the genus &quot;Corallus&quot; are found in Central America, South America and the West Indies. In Central America they occur in Honduras, eastern Guatemala through Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The range of the genus in South America includes Pacific Colombia and Ecuador, as well as the Amazon Basin from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and northern Bolivia through Brazil to Venezuela, Isla Margarita, Trinidad, Tobago, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. In the West Indies it is found on St. Vincent, the Grenadines (Bequia Island, Ile Quatre, Baliceaux, Mustique, Canouan, Maryeau, Union Island, Petit Martinique and Carriacou), Grenada and the Windward Islands (Lesser Antilles).

==Species==
, nine species are recognized in this genus. &quot;C. annulatus&quot; was formerly treated as a subspecies of &quot;C. annulatus&quot; but is now treated as a species in its own right.
*) Not including the nominate subspecies.
T) Type species.

==Captivity==
Two species of &quot;Corallus&quot; are frequently imported as pets, the Amazon tree boa, &quot;C. hortulanus&quot;, and the emerald tree boa, &quot;C. caninus&quot;. Most, if not all, have an aggressive demeanor and will strike readily. Their stunning coloration makes them popular, but their specialized habitat and feeding make them suitable only for advanced keepers. Captive bred specimens are much more docile than their wild caught counterparts.

==Extinct species==
A fossil species, &quot;Corallus priscus&quot;, was described in Brazil in 2001.

<text>The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal) (abbreviated as RCH) is an armoured reconnaissance regiment of the Primary Reserve in the Canadian Armed Forces. It is one of the oldest cavalry regiments in North America, tracing a direct history to the Montreal Volunteer Cavalry formed in the late eighteenth century. Its Colonel-in-Chief is Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, and its allied regiment is the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars. Its mission consists of supporting the Regular Force in operational deployments, peacetime tasks, and supporting the civilian authorities. 

==Lineage==
The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal) derives from the Montreal Volunteer Cavalry (formed in the late eighteenth century). The present regiment perpetuates five cavalry units and one armoured unit: the Royal Montreal Cavalry, the 5th Dragoons, the 6th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars (6th DCRCH), the 11th Argenteuil Rangers, the 17th Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars (17th DYRCH), and the 1st Motor Machine Gun Brigade.

* Redesignated on 18 September, 1885, as the &quot;6th Regiment of Cavalry&quot;.
* Redesignated on 20 June, 1890, as the &quot;6th Regiment of Cavalry “Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars”&quot;.
* Redesignated on 1 January, 1893, as the &quot;6th “Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars”&quot;.

== History ==
Since the amalgamation, the regiment itself has not been involved in any hostilities but has constantly provided individuals to augment the Regular Force in both NATO and United Nations peacekeeping duties as well as domestic operations such as Operation Recuperation during the Ice Storm of 1998.

The regiment received its second guidon on December 3, 1974, the 100th anniversary of regimental status and its 135th year as a Canadian cavalry unit.

From 1986 to 1990, the regiment won the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps Buchanan Trophy (the best armour unit in the Eastern and Atlantic Areas) a total of five times and the Worthington Trophy (the best armour unit in Canada) a total of three times.

In August 1990, the regiment commanded and formed the headquarters and one complete squadron for the first-of-its-kind Militia brigade-level exercise. Exercise En Guard was held at Canadian Forces Base Gagetown and included the four armoured units of Secteur de l&#x27;Est (RBSE). Shortly afterwards, in September 1990, the regiment sent a 21-man contingent to Cyprus augmenting the 12e Régiment blindé du Canada on its United Nations peacekeeping tour of duty.

Since 1990 the regiment has deployed troops on UN missions in both Haiti and Bosnia, as well as providing personnel during the Oka crisis and the ice storm of 1998. The unit has also continued to participate in the Noble Lion exercises as part of Land Force Quebec Area. On April 1, 1997, The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal) became the establishment armoured regiment (tank) for the newly formed 34th Canadian Brigade Group (34 CBG). E organization falls under the command of 34 CBG.

In late 2003, the mission of the RCH was changed to fit the restructuring plan of the Canadian Forces Land Force Command. The troops were converted back to a role of armoured reconnaissance. The regiment comprises two squadrons: B Squadron (combat troops) and C&amp;S Squadron (command and support). On May 1, 2005, the RCH received its third guidon.

In 2007 seven members of the RCH were deployed to Afghanistan as part of Joint Task Force Afghanistan (JTF AFG) Rotation 4, which included approximately 2330 Canadian Forces members from the Quebec region.

From November 2010 to July 2011, six members of the RCH were again deployed in the Kandahar region of Afghanistan as part of the Joint Task Force Afghanistan Rotation 10.

<doc id="859629" wikidata="Q304461" url="?curid=859629" title="1991 NHL entry draft">
<text>The 1991 NHL entry draft was the 29th NHL entry draft. It was held on June 22 at the Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo, New York. A total of 264 players were drafted. The worst team in the previous 1990–91 season, the Quebec Nordiques, was given the first overall pick while the expansion San Jose Sharks held the second overall pick.

The draft was famous for the controversy surrounding star first overall draft pick, touted by some observers to be The Next One, Eric Lindros, who was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques but immediately refused to sign a contract. What followed (in 1992) was one of the biggest trades in NHL history, which the Philadelphia Flyers used to acquire Lindros, in the process trading away future superstar Peter Forsberg.

The last active player in the NHL from this draft class was Ray Whitney, who retired after the 2013–14 season, he also led the entire draft in Games played (1330), as well as Points (1064).

<text>The Little Sequatchie River is a tributary of the Sequatchie River in Tennessee. Unlike its larger namesake, it does not have a spectacular large spring source but is the result of the confluence of many smaller streams in a very remote, scenic area of the Cumberland Plateau along the line between Grundy County and Marion County. It flows down a narrow valley, basically south. Its mouth is near the community of Sequatchie (also rendered &quot;Sequachee&quot;).

<doc id="859643" wikidata="Q2041582" url="?curid=859643" title="Howick house">
<text>The Howick house is a Mesolithic site located in Northumberland, England. It was found when an amateur archaeologist noticed flint tools eroding out of a sandy cliff face near the village of Howick. Investigations found a circle of substantial post holes with charcoal stains in their bases, a number of smaller stake holes, some angled in from outside a hollow, and inside the house a number of shallow hearths filled with charcoal, burnt nutshells and some fragments of bone. Radiocarbon dating of the charred hazelnut shells established that the building was constructed about 7600 BC and occupied for about 100 years, which led to the find being called &quot;Britain&#x27;s oldest house&quot;. This title was disputed in 2010 when the discovery of the even older &#x27;house-structure&#x27; at Star Carr in North Yorkshire was announced.

Some of the hearths showed signs only of nut roasting, and the numbers of shells suggested that food was cooked here in quantity, perhaps to preserve it for times of scarcity. Together with the very substantial construction shown by the size of post holes, this led to the view that the house was occupied permanently rather than being used on a transient or seasonal basis as expected during the Mesolithic period. Charred hazelnut shells have been found at several other sites from this period, including Cramond, but their smaller stake holes were interpreted as remains of a temporary encampment.

The interpretation that this was a permanent residence for hunter-gatherers is supported by analysis that Howick is a place where natural resources would have allowed all-year-round occupation. Its coastal position provided animals, flint for tools, wood for construction and fuel, fish, seals, sea birds and their eggs, shellfish and a nearby source of fresh water that was available at the time of occupation. Many sites from this time are coastal, but the particular circumstances found here and the evidence of ceremonial ritual from the site at Star Carr in Yorkshire, only 100 miles away, are interpreted as indicating that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers were capable of establishing permanent settlements.

<text>Pushkinskaya Square or Pushkin Square () is a pedestrian open space in the Tverskoy District in central Moscow. Historically, it was known as Strastnaya Square () before being renamed for Alexander Pushkin in 1937.

It is located at the junction of the Boulevard Ring (Tverskoy Boulevard to the southwest and Strastnoy Boulevard to the northeast) and Tverskaya Street, northwest of the Kremlin. It is not only one of the busiest city squares in Moscow, but also one of the busiest in the world.

The former Strastnaya Square name originates from the Passion Monastery (, Strastnoy Monastery), which was demolished in the 1930s by the Soviet regime.

At the center of the square is a statue of Pushkin, funded by public subscription and unveiled by Ivan Turgenev and Fyodor Dostoyevsky in 1880. In 1950, Joseph Stalin had the statue moved to the other side of the Tverskaya Street, where the historic Passion Monastery had formerly stood. On 5 December 1965, Glasnost Meeting, the first spontaneous public political demonstration in the Soviet Union after the Second World War, took place here. In January 1990, the first McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in Soviet Union and largest one in the world at that time opened here.
