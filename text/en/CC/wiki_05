<text>James Whitcomb Riley (October 7, 1849 – July 22, 1916) was an American writer, poet, and best-selling author. During his lifetime he was known as the &quot;Hoosier Poet&quot; and &quot;Children&#x27;s Poet&quot; for his dialect works and his children&#x27;s poetry. His poems tend to be humorous or sentimental. Of the approximately 1,000 poems Riley wrote, the majority are in dialect. His famous works include &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot; and &quot;The Raggedy Man&quot;.

Riley began his career writing verses as a sign maker and submitting poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s endorsement, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the late 1870s. He gradually rose to prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, appearing either alone or with other famous talents. During this period Riley&#x27;s long-term addiction to alcohol began to affect his performing abilities, and he suffered financially as a result. However, once he extricated himself from a series of poorly negotiated contracts that sought to limit his earnings, he began to accumulate wealth and eventually became a financial success.

By the 1890s, Riley had become known as a bestselling author. His children&#x27;s poems were compiled into a book illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy. Titled &quot;Rhymes of Childhood&quot;, it was his most popular and sold millions of copies. As a poet, Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his lifetime. He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly called on to perform readings at national civic events. He continued to write and hold occasional poetry readings until a stroke paralyzed his right arm in 1910.

Riley&#x27;s chief legacy was his influence in fostering the creation of a Midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the Golden Age of Indiana Literature. With other writers of his era, he helped create a caricature of Midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children.

==Early life==
===Family and background===
James Whitcomb Riley was born on October 7, 1849, in the town of Greenfield, Indiana, the third of the six children of Reuben Andrew and Elizabeth Marine Riley. Riley&#x27;s grandparents came from Ireland to Pennsylvania before moving to the Midwest Riley&#x27;s father was an attorney, and in the year before his birth, he was elected a member of the Indiana House of Representatives as a Democrat. He developed a friendship with James Whitcomb, the governor of Indiana, after whom he named his son. Martin Riley, Riley&#x27;s uncle, was an amateur poet who occasionally wrote verses for local newspapers. Riley was fond of his uncle who influenced his interest in poetry.

Shortly after his birth, the family moved into a larger house in town. Riley was &quot;a quiet boy, not talkative, who would often go about with one eye shut as he observed and speculated&quot;. His mother taught him to read and write at home before sending him to the local community school in 1852. He found school difficult and was frequently in trouble. Often punished, he had nothing kind to say of his teachers in his writings. His poem &quot;The Educator&quot; tells of an intelligent but sinister teacher and may have been based on one of his instructors. Riley was most fond of his last teacher, Lee O. Harris. Harris noticed Riley&#x27;s interest in poetry and reading and encouraged him to pursue it further.

Riley&#x27;s school attendance was sporadic, and he graduated from grade eight at age 20 in 1869. In an 1892 newspaper article, Riley confessed he knew little of mathematics, geography, or science, and his understanding of proper grammar was poor. Later critics, like Henry Beers, pointed to his poor education as the reason for his success in writing; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity.

===Childhood influences===
Riley lived in his parents&#x27; home until he was 21 years old. At age five, he began spending time at the Brandywine Creek near Greenfield. His poems &quot;A Barefoot Boy&quot; and &quot;The Old Swimmin&#x27; Hole&quot; refer to his time there. As a child he was introduced to many people who later influenced his poetry. His father regularly brought home clients and disadvantaged people to help them. Riley&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raggedy Man&quot; is based on a German tramp his father hired to work at the family home. Riley picked up the cadence and character of the dialect of central Indiana from travelers along the old National Road. Their speech greatly influenced the hundreds of poems he wrote in 19th century Hoosier dialect.

His mother often told him stories of fairies, trolls, and giants, and read him children&#x27;s poems. She was very superstitious and influenced Riley with many of her beliefs. They both placed &quot;spirit rappings&quot; in their homes on places like tables and bureaux to capture any spirits that may have been wandering about. This influence can be found in many of his works, including &quot;Flying Islands of the Night&quot;.

As was common at that time, Riley and his friends had few toys, and amused themselves with activities. With his mother&#x27;s help, Riley began creating plays and theatricals, which he and his friends would practice and perform in the back of a local grocery store. As he grew older, the boys named their troupe the Adelphians and began to hold their shows in barns where they could fit larger audiences. Riley wrote of these early performances in his poem &quot;When We First Played &#x27;Show″&quot;, referring to himself as &quot;Jamesy&quot;.

Many of Riley&#x27;s poems are filled with musical references. He had no musical education and was unable to read sheet music. His father taught him to play the guitar, and a friend taught him the violin. He performed in two different local bands and became so proficient on the violin he was invited to play with a group of adult Freemasons at several events. A few of his later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being &quot;A Short&#x27;nin&#x27; Bread Song—Pieced Out&quot;.

When Riley was 10 years old, the first library opened in his hometown. From an early age he developed a love of literature. He and his friends spent time at the library where the librarian read stories and poems to them. Charles Dickens became one Riley&#x27;s favorites and inspired the poems &quot;St. Lirriper&quot;, &quot;Christmas Season&quot;, and &quot;God Bless Us Every One&quot;.

Riley&#x27;s father enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War, leaving his wife to manage the family home. While he was away, the family took in a 12-year-old orphan named Mary Alice &quot;Allie&quot; Smith. She was the inspiration for Riley&#x27;s poem &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot;. Riley had intended titling the poem &quot;Little Orphant Allie&quot;, but a typesetter&#x27;s error changed it during printing.

===Finding poetry===
Riley&#x27;s father returned from the war partially paralyzed. He was unable to continue working in his legal practice, and the family soon fell into financial distress. The war&#x27;s negative effects soon caused his relationship with his family to deteriorate. He opposed Riley&#x27;s interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career. The family finances finally disintegrated. They were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm. Riley&#x27;s mother was able to keep peace in the family, but after her death in August from heart disease, Riley and his father had a final break. He blamed his mother&#x27;s death on his father&#x27;s failure to care for her in her final weeks. He continued to regret the loss of his childhood home. He wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war, subsequent poverty and his mother&#x27;s death. After the events of 1870, he developed an addiction to alcohol and struggled with it for the rest of his life.

Becoming increasingly belligerent toward his father, Riley moved out of the family home and briefly took a job painting houses before leaving Greenfield in November 1870. He was recruited as a Bible salesman and began working in the nearby town of Rushville, Indiana. The job provided little income and he returned to Greenfield in March 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter. He completed it and opened a business in Greenfield creating and maintaining signs. His earliest known poems are verses he wrote as clever advertisements for his customers.

Riley began participating in local theater productions with the Adelphians to earn extra income. During the winter months, when the demand for painting declined, Riley began writing poetry which he mailed to his brother who lived in Indianapolis. He acted as Riley&#x27;s agent and offered the poems to the &quot;Indianapolis Mirror&quot; newspaper free of charge. His first poem was featured on March 30, 1872, under the pseudonym &quot;Jay Whit&quot;. Riley wrote more than 20 poems to the newspaper, including one that was featured on the front page.

In July 1872, after becoming convinced sales would provide more income than sign painting, he joined the McCrillus Company based in Anderson, Indiana. The company sold patent medicines that they marketed using small traveling shows around Indiana. Riley joined the act as a huckster, calling himself the &quot;Painter Poet&quot;. He traveled with the act, composing poetry and performing at the shows. After his act he sold tonics to his audience, sometimes employing dishonesty. During one stop, Riley presented himself as a formerly blind painter who had been cured by a tonic, using himself as evidence to encourage the audience to purchase it.

Riley began sending poems to his brother again in February 1873. About the same time he and several friends began an advertisement company. The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard-like signs on the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that were visible from a distance. The company was financially successful, but Riley was continually drawn to poetry. In October, he traveled to South Bend where he took a job at Stockford &amp; Blowney painting verses on signs for a month; the shortness of his stay at this job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time.

In early 1874, Riley returned to Greenfield to become a full-time writer. In February, he submitted a poem titled &quot;At Last&quot; to a Connecticut newspaper the &quot;Danbury News&quot;. The editors accepted it, paid him for it, and wrote him a letter encouraging him to submit more. Riley found the note and his first payment inspiring. He began submitting poems regularly to the editors, but after the newspaper shut down in 1875, Riley was left without a paying publisher. He began traveling and performing with the Adelphians around central Indiana to earn an income while he searched for a new publisher. In August 1875, he joined another traveling tonic show run by the Wizard Oil Company.

==Early career==

===Newspaper work===
Riley began writing to the well-known American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow during late 1875 seeking his endorsement to help him start a career as a poet. He submitted many poems to Longfellow, whom he considered the greatest living poet. Not receiving a prompt response, he sent similar letters to John Townsend Trowbridge and several other prominent writers asking for an endorsement. Longfellow finally replied in a brief letter, telling Riley, &quot;I have read [the poems] in great pleasure, and think they show a true poetic faculty and insight.&quot; Riley carried the letter with him everywhere and, hoping to receive a job offer and to create a market for his poetry, he began sending poems to dozens of newspapers touting Longfellow&#x27;s endorsement. Among the newspapers to take an interest in his poems was the &quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot;, a major Republican Party metropolitan newspaper in Indiana. Among the first poems it purchased from him were &quot;Song of the New Year&quot;, &quot;An Empty Nest&quot;, and a short story entitled &quot;A Remarkable Man&quot;.

The editors of the &quot;Anderson Democrat&quot; discovered Riley&#x27;s poems in the &quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot; and offered him a job as a reporter in February 1877. Riley accepted. He worked gathering local news, writing articles, and assisting with typesetting. He continued to write poems regularly for the newspaper and to sell other poems to larger newspapers. During the year, Riley spent working in Anderson, he met and courted Edora Mysers. The couple became engaged, but ended the relationship after they had decided against marriage in August.

Despite local success at having his poems published, his submissions continued to be rejected by established eastern periodicals as being below their standards. Riley began formulating a plot to prove his work was of good quality and that it was being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. He wrote a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the &quot;Kokomo Dispatch&quot; under a fictitious name claiming it was a long-lost Poe poem. The &quot;Dispatch&quot; published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem was authentic, most did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be written by Poe. A &quot;Dispatch&quot; employee learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the &quot;Kokomo Tribune&quot;, which published an exposé that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the &quot;Dispatch&quot;″s credibility and harmed Riley&#x27;s reputation.

In the aftermath of the Poe plot, Riley was dismissed from the &quot;Democrat&quot;. He returned to Greenfield to spend time writing poetry. He met Clara Louise Bottsford, a school teacher boarding in his father&#x27;s home. They found they had much in common, particularly their love of literature. The couple began a 12-year, intermittent relationship, Riley&#x27;s longest. In mid-1878, the couple had their first breakup caused partly by Riley&#x27;s alcoholism. Riley made a first attempt to give up liquor by joining a local temperance organization but quit after a few weeks.

===Performing poet===
Without a steady income, his financial situation worsened. Riley began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines, including &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, but was informed that although it showed promise, his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications. Locally, he was still dealing with the stigma of the Poe plot. The &quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot; and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry, leaving him desperate for income. On the advice of a friend, in January 1878 Riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings. In exchange, he received a portion of the profit his performances earned. These circuits were popular at the time, and Riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings.

In August 1878, he followed Indiana Governor James D. Williams as speaker at a civic event in a small town near Indianapolis. He recited a recently composed poem, &quot;A Childhood Home of Long Ago&quot;, telling of life in pioneer Indiana. The poem was well received and was given good reviews by several newspapers.

&quot;Flying Islands of the Night&quot; is the only play Riley wrote and published. Written while he was traveling with the Adelphians but never performed, the play has similarities to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which Riley may have used as a model. It concerns a kingdom besieged by evil forces of a sinister queen who is defeated eventually by an angel-like heroine. Most reviews were positive. Riley published the play, and it became popular in the central Indiana area during late 1878, helping him to convince newspapers to accept his poetry again. In November 1879, he was offered a position as a columnist at the &quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot; and accepted after being encouraged by E.B. Matindale, the paper&#x27;s chief editor.

Although the play and his newspaper work helped expose him to a wider audience, the chief source of his increasing popularity was his performances on the lecture circuit. He gave both dramatic and comedic readings of his poetry, and by early 1879 could guarantee large crowds when he performed. In an 1894 article, Hamlin Garland wrote that Riley&#x27;s celebrity resulted from his reading talent saying, &quot;his vibrant individual voice, his flexible lips, his droll glance, united to make him at once poet and comedian—comedian in the sense in which makes for tears as well as for laughter&quot;. Although he was a good performer, his acts were not entirely original in style; he frequently copied practices developed by Samuel Clemens and Will Carleton. His tour in 1880 took him to every city in Indiana where he was introduced by local dignitaries and other popular figures, including novelist Maurice Thompson with whom he began to develop a close friendship.

Developing and maintaining publicity became a constant job requiring more of his attention as his fame grew. Keeping his alcohol addiction secret, maintaining the persona of a simple rural poet and a friendly common person became most important. Riley identified these traits as the basis of his popularity during the mid-1880s and wrote of his need to maintain a fictional persona. He encouraged the stereotype by writing poetry he thought would help build his identity. He was aided by editorials he wrote and submitted to the &quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot; offering observations on events from his perspective as a &quot;humble rural poet&quot;. He changed his appearance to look more mainstream, and began by shaving his mustache off and abandoning the flamboyant dress he employed in his early circuit tours.

By 1880 his poems were published nationally and receiving positive reviews. &quot;Tom Johnson&#x27;s Quit&quot; was carried by newspapers in twenty states, thanks in part to the careful cultivation of his popularity. Riley became frustrated that despite his growing acclaim he found it difficult to achieve financial success. In the early 1880s, in addition to his steady performing, Riley began producing many poems to increase his income. Half of his poems were written during this period. The constant labor had adverse effects on his health, which was worsened by his drinking. At the urging of Maurice Thompson, he again attempted to stop drinking liquor, but was unable to give it up for more than a few months.

==&quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot;==

===Newspaper poet===
Riley moved to Indianapolis at the end of 1879 to begin his employment as a newspaper poet with the &quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot;. It was the only metropolitan newspaper there with daily editions and had a wide readership. He wrote a regular society column that often included verses of poetry. Thereafter Riley met many prominent people and began a close friendship with Eugene V. Debs. He enjoyed Riley&#x27;s works and often complimented his sentiments. Riley had used the pseudonym &quot;Jay Whit&quot; since he began writing poetry but finally began to use his own name in April 1881.

Riley renewed his relationship with Bottsford in 1880, and the two corresponded frequently. Their relationship remained unstable, but Riley became deeply attached to her. She inspired his poem &quot;The Werewife&quot;, which told of a perfect wife who could suddenly become a demonic monster. Bottsford pressed Riley for marriage several times, but he refused. They broke off their relationship a second time in 1881 when she discovered his correspondence with two other women, and found he had taken a secret vacation to Wisconsin with one of them.

Riley&#x27;s alcoholism influenced some of his poems during his time working for the &quot;Journal&quot;. These included &quot;On Quitting California&quot;, &quot;John Golliher&#x27;s Third Womern&quot;, &quot;[sic]&quot; and &quot;The Dismal Fate of Tit&quot;, which each refer to the delirium caused by drinking. Although Riley rarely published anything controversial, some of his poems published from the same period, including &quot;Afterwhiles&quot;, allude to drug usage and make vague sexual references. During the early 1880s, Riley still made submissions to the elite literary periodicals, but continued to be rejected. Riley found this discouraging, but persevered. He believed he would never be recognized as a true literary figure until one of the prestigious periodicals published his work.

===Lyceum circuit===
Riley undertook occasional reading tours around Indiana, and in August 1880 he was invited to perform at Asbury University. His performance there so impressed the local Phi Kappa Psi chapter, he was invited to join as an honorary member. Through the fraternity he met Robert Jones Burdette, a writer and minister in the Indianapolis area. Burdette was a member of the Redpath Lyceum Bureau of Boston, a prominent lecture circuit whose regular speakers included Ralph Waldo Emerson. Burdette encouraged Riley to join the circuit through its Chicago branch. Riley&#x27;s accumulated debt and low income began causing him trouble in 1881, and he decided that rejoining a lecture circuit would provide much needed funds. His agreement for continued employment with the circuit depended on his ability to draw audiences during the first season, beginning in April 1881. He succeeded, drawing the largest crowds in Chicago and Indianapolis.

Because of his success in the Midwest, the circuit leaders invited him to make an east coast tour, starting in Boston at the Tremont Temple in February 1882. Riley agreed, signing a ten-year agreement and granting half his receipts to his agent. Before his performance, he traveled to Longfellow&#x27;s home in Massachusetts and convinced him to agree to a meeting. Their brief meeting was one of Riley&#x27;s fondest memories, and he wrote a lengthy article about it after Longfellow&#x27;s death only a month later. Longfellow encouraged Riley to focus on poetry and gave him advice for his upcoming performance where Riley was well received. His poems were greeted with laughter and praised in the city&#x27;s newspaper reviews. Boston was the literary center of the United States at the time, and the impression Riley made on the city&#x27;s literary community finally encouraged prestigious periodicals to publish his work. &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; was the first to do so, running &quot;In Swimming-Time&quot; in its September 1883 issue. Until the 1890s, it remained the only major literary magazine to publish Riley&#x27;s work. Knowing the high standards of the magazine, Riley reserved his best work each year to submit to it, including one of his favorites, &quot;The Old Man and Jim&quot; in 1887.

By the end of 1882, Riley&#x27;s finances began improving dramatically, thanks largely to the income from his performances. During 1883 he began writing his &quot;Boone County&quot; poems under the pseudonym &quot;Benjamin F. Johnson of Boone&quot;. They were almost entirely written in dialect and emphasized topics of rural life during the early nineteenth century, often employing nostalgia and the simplicity of country life as elements. &quot;The Old Swimmin&#x27;-Hole&quot; and &quot;When the Frost Is on the Punkin&#x27;&quot; were the most popular and helped earn the entire series critical acclaim. The topics were popular with readers, reminding many of them of their childhood. Merrill, Meigs &amp; Company (later renamed Bobbs-Merrill Company) approached Riley to compile the poems into a book. Riley agreed and his first book was published in August 1883, titled &quot;The Old Swimmin&#x27;-Hole and &#x27;Leven More Poems&quot;. The book&#x27;s popularity necessitated a second printing before the end of the year. During this period Riley determined that his most popular poems were those on topics of rural life, and he began to use that as a common theme throughout his future work.

The income from his book allowed Riley to ease his busy work schedule; he submitted articles to the &quot;Journal&quot; less often and made fewer lecture stops. He wrote fewer poems but their quality improved; he wrote his most famous poems during the mid-1880s, including &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot;. Riley attempted to secure a new job at a periodical and leave the &quot;Journal&quot;, but the magazines would not hire him unless he was willing to relocate. Riley was steadfast in his refusal to leave Indiana telling reporters that his rural home was his inspiration and to leave would ruin his poetry.

Riley renewed his relationship with Bottsford for a third and final time in 1883. The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers&#x27; rendezvous. He stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable. Bottsford became convinced Riley was seeing another woman, however, and they ended their relationship in January 1885. Riley&#x27;s sister, Mary, had become a close friend of Bottsford and scolded him for his mistreatment of her. Her reputation was tarnished by the affair, and she found it difficult to find employment once their relationship was over.

In 1884, Riley toured the major cities in the eastern United States again. Following the lectures, he began compiling a second book of poetry. He completed it during July, and Bowen-Merrill published it in December with the title &quot;The Boss Girl, A Christmas Story and Other Sketches&quot;. The book, which contained humorous poetry and short stories, received mixed reviews. It was popular around Indiana, where most of its copies were sold. One reviewer, however, called the poems &quot;weird, nightmarish, and eerie&quot; and compared them to Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s works.

While Riley was working on his book, he was unexpectedly invited by James B. Pond, the agent for many of the nation&#x27;s major performers, to join a one-hundred nights&#x27; engagement in New York City in a show that included Samuel Clemens and Dudley Warner. Riley was unable to agree with the Redpath Bureau who had to authorize any other performance under the terms of their contract. He believed his contract with the Redpath Bureau was limiting his opportunities, and his relationship with his agent became strained.

===Western Association of Writers===
Due in part to the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to form an association to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer Lew Wallace, author of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, was a major promoter of the effort. During 1885, more than one hundred writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president. The association never succeeded in its goal of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group but came to depend on its regular meetings as an escape from his normally hectic schedule.

Through the association, Riley became acquainted with most of the notable writers in the Midwestern United States, including humorist Edgar Wilson Nye of Chicago. After completing his lecture circuit in 1885, Riley formed a partnership with Nye and his agent to begin a new tour. The Redpath Bureau agreed to allow Riley to tour with Nye, provided he maintained his financial agreements with them. In addition to touring, Riley and Nye collaborated on a book, &quot;Nye and Riley&#x27;s Railway Guide&quot;, a collection of humorous anecdotes and poems intended to parody popular tourist literature of the day. Published in 1888, the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints.

In October 1887, Riley and the association joined with other writers to petition the United States Congress to attempt to negotiate international treaties to protect American copyrights abroad. The group became known as the International Copyright League and had significant success in its efforts. When traveling to one of the league&#x27;s meetings in New York City that year, Riley was struck by Bell&#x27;s palsy. He recovered after three weeks but remained secluded to hide the effects of the sickness which he believed was caused by his alcoholism. He made another attempt to stop drinking alcohol with the help of a minister, but soon returned to his old habit.

After recovering, Riley remained briefly in New York to participate in a show at Chickering Hall with Edgar Nye, Samuel Clemens, and several others. Riley was introduced by James Russell Lowell before his performance, and Lowell gave Riley a glowing endorsement to the crowd. His poetry brought both tears and laughter according to &quot;The New York Sun&quot;. Critic Edmund Clarence Stedman, one of the foremost literary critics of the era, was present and wrote that Riley&#x27;s dialect poems were the finest he had ever heard, &quot;in which a homely dramatis persona&#x27;s heart is laid open by subtle indirect, absolutely sure and tender&quot; poetry. As a result of his New York performance, his name and picture were carried in all the major eastern papers, and he quickly became well known throughout the United States. Sales of &quot;The Boss Girl&quot; increased, resulting in the fifth and largest printing, and Riley finally began to achieve the widespread fame he sought.

Clemens disliked being upstaged by Riley and attempted to avoid any future joint performances with him. According to one review, Clemens &quot;shriveled up into a bitter patch of melancholy in the fierce light of Mr. Riley&#x27;s humour&quot;.

After returning home from his tour in early 1888, Riley finished compiling his third book, titled &quot;Old-Fashioned Roses&quot;. Arranged to appeal to British readers, it included only a few of his dialect poems and consisted mostly of sonnets. The book reprinted many poems Riley had already published but included some new ones he wrote specifically for the book, including &quot;The Days Gone By&quot;, &quot;The Little White Hearse&quot;, and &quot;The Serenade&quot;. The book was Riley&#x27;s favorite because it included his finest works and was published by the prestigious Longmans, Green Publishers with high quality printing and binding.

In late 1888 he finished work on a fourth book, &quot;Pipes o&#x27; Pan at Zekesbury&quot; which was released to great acclaim in the United States. Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens and way of life. It received mixed reviews from literary critics who wrote of it that Riley&#x27;s stories were not of the same quality as his poetry. The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints.

Riley was quickly becoming wealthy from his books and touring, earning nearly $20,000 in 1888. He no longer needed his job at the journal and left it near the end of that year. The newspaper had served to earn him fame and had published hundreds of his articles, stories, and poems.

==National fame==

===Politics===
In March 1888, Riley traveled to Washington, D.C. where he had dinner at the White House with other members of the International Copyright League and President Grover Cleveland. Riley gave a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley&#x27;s performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley&#x27;s acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.

Upon Harrison&#x27;s election, he suggested Riley be named the national poet laureate, but Congress failed to act on the request. Riley was still honored by Harrison and visited him at the White House on several occasions to perform at civic events.

===Pay problems and scandal===
Riley and Nye made arrangements with James Pond to do two national tours during 1888 and 1889. They were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds having to be turned away. The shows were usually forty-five minutes to an hour long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal, and the two men adjusted their performances based on their audiences&#x27; reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility. Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, Augustin Daly was so enthralled by it he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theater actors.

Despite serving as the act&#x27;s main draw, Riley was not permitted to become an equal partner in the venture. Nye and Pond both received a percentage of the net profit, while Riley was paid a flat rate for each performance. In addition, because of his past agreements with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, Riley was required to pay half of his fee to his agent Amos Walker. This meant the other men profited more than Riley from his own work.

To remedy this situation, Riley hired his brother-in-law Henry Eitel, an Indianapolis banker, to manage his finances and act on his behalf to try to extricate him from his contract. Despite discussions and assurances from Pond that he would work to address the problem, Eitel had no success. Pond ultimately made the situation worse by booking months of solid performances, not allowing Riley and Nye a day of rest. These events affected Riley physically and emotionally; he became despondent and began his worst period of alcoholism. During November 1889, several shows were cancelled after Riley became severely inebriated at a stop in Madison, Wisconsin.

Walker began monitoring Riley and denying him access to liquor, but he found ways to evade him. At a stop at the Masonic Temple Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel&#x27;s bartender to sneak whiskey to his room. He became too drunk to perform and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated their partnership and the tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.

He secretly left Louisville at night and returned to Indianapolis by train. Eitel defended him to the press to gain sympathy for Riley, explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made. Riley refused to speak to reporters, however, and hid himself for weeks. Much to Riley&#x27;s surprise, the news reports made him more popular than ever. Many people thought the stories were exaggerated, and Riley&#x27;s carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic. Riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath, but they soon began corresponding with him asking him to resume writing. This encouraged Riley, and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career.

The negative press did not end, however, as Nye and Pond threatened to sue Riley for causing their tour to end prematurely. They claimed to have lost $20,000. Walker threatened a separate suit demanding $1,000. Riley hired Indianapolis lawyer William P. Fishback to represent him and the men settled out of court. The full details of the settlement were never disclosed, but whatever the case, Riley finally extricated himself from his old contracts and became a free agent. The exorbitant amount Riley was being sued for only reinforced public opinion that he had been mistreated by his partners and helped him maintain his image. Nye and Riley remained good friends, and Riley later wrote Pond and Walker were the source of the problems.

Riley&#x27;s poetry had become popular in Britain, in large part due to his book &quot;Old-Fashioned Roses&quot;. In May 1891 he traveled to England to tour and made what he considered a literary pilgrimage. He landed in Liverpool and traveled first to Dumfries, Scotland, the home and burial place of Robert Burns. Riley had long been compared to Burns by critics because they both used dialect in their poetry and drew inspiration from their rural homes. He then traveled to Edinburgh, York, and London, reciting poetry for gatherings at each stop. Augustin Daly arranged for him to give a poetry reading to prominent British actors in London. Riley was warmly welcomed by its literary and theatrical community, and he toured places that Shakespeare had frequented.

Riley quickly tired of traveling abroad and began longing for home, writing to his nephew that he regretted having left the United States. He curtailed his journey and returned to New York City in August. He spent the next months in his Greenfield home attempting to write an epic poem, but after several attempts gave up, believing he did not possess the ability.

By 1890, Riley had authored almost all his famous poems. The few poems he wrote during the 1890s were generally less well received by the public. As a solution, Riley and his publishers began reusing poetry from other books and printing some of his earliest works. When &quot;Neighborly Poems&quot; was published in 1891, a critic working for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; pointed out the use of Riley&#x27;s earliest works, commenting that he was using his popularity to push his crude earlier works onto the public only to make money. Riley&#x27;s newest poems published in the 1894 book &quot;Armazindy&quot; received very negative reviews that referred to poems like &quot;The Little Dog-Woggy&quot; and &quot;Jargon-Jingle&quot; as &quot;drivel&quot; and to Riley as a &quot;worn out genius&quot;. Most of his growing number of critics suggested that he ignored the quality of the poems for the sake of making money.

===Last tours===
Although Riley was wealthy from his books, he was able to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in managing his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley&#x27;s publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.

During his 1893 tour, Riley lectured mostly in the western United States, and in his 1894 tour in the east. His performances were major events, and generally sold out within days of their announcements. In 1894 he allowed the author Douglass Sherley to join his tour. Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books. The literary community had dismissed his work, but Riley was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance.

In 1895 Riley undertook his last tour, making stops in most of the major cities in the United States. Advertised as his final performances, there was incredible demand for tickets and Riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour. He and Sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and Nye had done. Riley often lamented the lack of change in the program. He found when he tried to introduce new material, or left out any of his most popular poems, the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites.

===Children&#x27;s poet===
Following the death of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children. To compensate for this, he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in it. He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took on his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.

Riley returned to live near Indianapolis later in 1893, boarding in a private home in the Lockerbie district, then a small suburb. He developed a close friendship with his landlords, the Nickum and Holstein families. The home became a destination for local schoolchildren to whom Riley would regularly recite poetry and tell stories. Riley&#x27;s friends often visited his home, and he developed a closer relationship with Eugene Debs.

The same year, he began compiling his poems of most interest to children into a new book entitled &quot;Rhymes of Childhood&quot;. The book was richly illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy, and Riley wrote a few new poems for the book under the pseudonym &quot;Uncle Sydney&quot;. &quot;Rhymes of Childhood&quot; became Riley&#x27;s best selling book, and sold millions of copies. It has remained in print continually since 1912 and helped earn him the nickname the &quot;Children&#x27;s Poet&quot;. Even Riley&#x27;s rival, Clemens, commented that the book was &quot;charming&quot; and made him weep for his &quot;lost youth&quot;.
==Later life==

===National poet===
Riley had become very wealthy by the time he stopped touring in 1895 and was earning $1,000 a week. Although he retired, he continued to make minor appearances. In 1896, Riley performed four shows in Denver. Most of the performances of his later life were at civic celebrations. He was a regular speaker at Decoration Day events and delivered poetry before the unveiling of monuments in Washington, D.C. Newspapers began referring to him as the &quot;National Poet&quot;, &quot;the poet laureate of America&quot;, and &quot;the people&#x27;s poet laureate&quot;. Riley wrote many of his patriotic poems for such events, including &quot;The Soldier&quot;, &quot;The Name of Old Glory&quot;, and his most famous such poem, &quot;America!&quot;. The 1902 poem &quot;America, Messiah of Nations&quot; was written and read by Riley for the dedication of the Indianapolis Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument.

The only new poetry Riley published after the end of the century were elegies for famous friends. The poetic qualities of the poems were often poor, but they contained many popular sentiments concerning the deceased. Among those he eulogized were Benjamin Harrison, Lew Wallace, and Henry Lawton. Because of the poor quality of the poems, his friends and publishers asked that he stop writing them, but he refused.

In 1897, Riley&#x27;s publishers suggested that he create a multi-volume series of books containing his complete life works. With the help of his nephew, Riley began working to compile the books. There were eventually sixteen volumes, which were finally completed in 1914. Such works were uncommon during the lives of writers, attesting to the uncommon popularity Riley had achieved.

His works had become staples for Ivy League literature courses and universities began offering him honorary degrees. The first was Yale in 1902, followed by a Doctorate of Letters from the University of Pennsylvania in 1904. Wabash College and Indiana University granted him similar awards. In 1908 he was elected a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters; in 1912 they conferred upon him a special medal for poetry.

Riley was influential in helping other poets start their careers, having particularly strong influences on Hamlin Garland, William Allen White, and Edgar Lee Masters. He discovered aspiring African-American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar in 1892. Riley thought Dunbar&#x27;s work was &quot;worthy of applause&quot; and wrote him letters of recommendation to help him get his work published.

===Declining health===
In 1901, Riley&#x27;s doctor diagnosed him with neurasthenia, a nervous disorder, and recommended long periods of rest as a cure. Riley remained ill for the rest of his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that he thought he could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.

In March 1909, Riley was stricken a second time with Bell&#x27;s palsy and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased over the course of the year. He was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910, he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began recovering his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.

Since the mid-1880s, Riley had been the nation&#x27;s most read poet, a trend that accelerated at the turn of the century. In 1912 Riley recorded readings of his most popular poetry to be sold by the Victor Talking Machine Company. He was the subject of three paintings by T. C. Steele. The Indianapolis Arts Association commissioned a portrait of Riley to be created by the world-famous painter John Singer Sargent. His image became a nationally known icon and many businesses capitalized on his popularity to sell their products; Hoosier Poet brand vegetables became a major trade-name in the Midwest.

In 1912, the governor of Indiana instituted Riley Day on the poet&#x27;s birthday. Schools were required to teach Riley&#x27;s poems to their pupils, and banquet events were held in his honor around the state. In 1915 and 1916 the celebration was national after being proclaimed in most states. The annual celebration continued in Indiana until 1968. In early 1916 Riley was filmed as part of a movie to celebrate Indiana&#x27;s centennial, the video is on display at the Indiana State Library.

===Death and legacy===
On July 22, 1916, Riley suffered a second stroke. He recovered enough during the day to speak and joke with his companions. He died before dawn on July 23. Riley&#x27;s death shocked the nation and made front page headlines in major newspapers. President Woodrow Wilson wrote a brief note to Riley&#x27;s family offering condolences on behalf of the entire nation. Indiana Governor Samuel M. Ralston offered to allow Riley to lie in state at the Indiana Statehouse—Abraham Lincoln is the only other person to have previously received such an honor. During the ten hours he lay in state on July 24, more than thirty-five thousand people filed past his bronze casket; the line was still miles long at the end of the day, and thousands were turned away. The next day a private funeral ceremony was held and attended by many dignitaries. A large funeral procession then carried him to Crown Hill Cemetery where his casket was placed in the receiving vault as his final resting place had not been determined between his hometown of Greenfield or his final home of Indianapolis. It was not until almost a year and half later October 6, 1917, the day before what would have been his birthday, that his casket was buried in a tomb during a private ceremony at the top of the hill, the highest point in the city of Indianapolis.

Within a year of Riley&#x27;s death, many memorials were created, including several by the James Whitcomb Riley Memorial Association. The James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children was created and named in his honor by a group of wealthy benefactors and opened in 1924. In the following years, other memorials intended to benefit children were created, including Camp Riley for youth with disabilities.

The memorial foundation purchased the poet&#x27;s Lockerbie home in Indianapolis, and it is now maintained as a museum. The James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home is the only late-Victorian home in Indiana that is open to the public. It is the United States&#x27; only late-Victorian preservation, featuring authentic furniture and décor from that era. His birthplace and boyhood home in Greenfield, Indiana, now the James Whitcomb Riley House, is preserved as a historical site. A Liberty ship commissioned April 23, 1942, was christened the &quot;SS James Whitcomb Riley&quot;. It served with the United States Maritime Commission until being scrapped in 1971.

James Whitcomb Riley High School opened in South Bend, Indiana, in 1924. In 1950, there was a James Whitcomb Riley Elementary School in Hammond, Indiana, but it was torn down in 2006. East Chicago, Indiana, had a Riley School at one time, as did neighboring Gary, Indiana, and Anderson, Indiana. One of New Castle, Indiana&#x27;s, elementary schools is named for Riley as is the road on which it is located. There are also Riley Elementary Schools in La Porte, Indiana, and Arlington Heights, Illinois. The former Greenfield High School was converted to Riley Elementary School and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Indianapolis Public School 43 is named for him and is located less than a mile from his burial place in Crown Hill Cemetery. Riley Towers, a high-rise apartment complex in Indianapolis, is named in his honor.

In 1940, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 10-cent stamp honoring Riley.

As a lasting tribute, the citizens of Greenfield hold a festival every year in Riley&#x27;s honor. Taking place the first or second weekend of October, the &quot;Riley Days&quot; festival traditionally commences with a flower parade in which local school children place flowers around Myra Reynolds Richards&#x27; statue of Riley on the county courthouse lawn, while a band plays lively music in honor of the poet. Weeks before the festival, the festival board has a queen contest. The pageant has been going on many years in honor of the Hoosier poet

According to historian Elizabeth Van Allen, Riley was instrumental in helping form a Midwestern cultural identity. The Midwestern United States had no significant literary community before the 1880s. The works of the Western Association of Writers, most notably those of Riley and Wallace, helped create the Midwest&#x27;s cultural identity and rival literary community to the established eastern literati. For this reason and the publicity Riley&#x27;s work created, he was commonly known as the &quot;Hoosier Poet&quot;.

==Critical reception and style==
Riley was among the most popular writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, known for his &quot;uncomplicated, sentimental, and humorous&quot; writing. Often writing his verses in dialect, his poetry caused readers to recall a nostalgic and simpler time in earlier American history. This gave his poetry a unique appeal during a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization in the United States. Riley was a prolific writer who &quot;achieved mass appeal partly due to his canny sense of marketing and publicity&quot;. He published more than fifty books, mostly of poetry and humorous short stories, and sold millions of copies.

He is often remembered for his most famous poems, including &quot;The Raggedy Man&quot; and &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot;. Many of his poems used events and people from his childhood as an inspiration for their subject matter. His poems often contain morals and warnings for children, with messages telling children to care for the less fortunate of society. David Galens and Van Allen both see these messages as Riley&#x27;s subtle response to the turbulent economic times of the Gilded Age and the growing progressive movement. Riley believed that urbanization robbed children of their innocence and sincerity, and in his poems he attempted to introduce and idolize characters who had not lost those qualities. His children&#x27;s poems are &quot;exuberant, performative, and often display Riley&#x27;s penchant for using humorous characterization, repetition, and dialect to make his poetry accessible to a wide-ranging audience&quot;.

Although hinted at indirectly in some poems, Riley wrote very little on serious subjects, and mocked attempts at serious poetry. Only a few of his sentimental poems concern serious subjects. &quot;Little Mandy&#x27;s Christmas-Tree&quot;, &quot;The Absence of Little Wesley&quot;, and &quot;The Happy Little Cripple&quot; are about poverty, the death of a child, and disabilities. Like his children&#x27;s poems, they also contain morals, suggesting society should pity the downtrodden and be charitable.

Riley wrote gentle and romantic poems that were not in dialect. They generally consist of sonnets and are strongly influenced by the works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. His standard English poetry was never as popular as his Hoosier dialect poems. Still less popular were the poems Riley wrote in his later years; most were to commemorate important events in American history or to eulogize the dead.

Riley&#x27;s contemporaries acclaimed him &quot;America&#x27;s best-loved poet&quot;. In 1920, Henry Beers lauded the works of Riley &quot;as natural and unaffected, with none of the discontent and deep thought of cultured song&quot;. Samuel Clemens, William Dean Howells, and Hamlin Garland, each praised Riley&#x27;s work and the idealism he expressed in his poetry. Only a few critics of the period found fault with Riley&#x27;s works. Ambrose Bierce criticized Riley for his frequent use of dialect. He accused Riley of using dialect to &quot;cover up [the] faulty construction&quot; of his poems. Edgar Lee Masters found Riley&#x27;s work to be superficial, claiming it lacked irony and that he had only a &quot;narrow emotional range&quot;. By the 1930s popular critical opinion towards Riley&#x27;s works began to shift in favor of the negative reviews. In 1951, James T. Farrell said Riley&#x27;s works were &quot;cliched&quot;. Galens wrote modern critics consider Riley to be a &quot;minor poet, whose work—provincial, sentimental, and superficial though it may have been—nevertheless struck a chord with a mass audience in a time of enormous cultural change&quot;. Thomas C. Johnson wrote that what most interests modern critics was Riley&#x27;s ability to market his work, saying he had a unique understanding of &quot;how to commodify his own image and the nostalgic dreams of an anxious nation&quot;.

Among the earliest widespread criticisms of Riley were opinions that his dialect writing did not actually represent the true dialect of central Indiana. In 1970 Peter Revell wrote Riley&#x27;s dialect was more like the poor speech of a child rather than the dialect of his region. He made extensive comparisons to historical texts and Riley&#x27;s dialect usage. Philip Greasley wrote that while &quot;some critics have dismissed him as sub-literary, insincere, and an artificial entertainer, his defenders reply that an author so popular with millions of people in different walks of life must contribute something of value, and that his faults, if any, can be ignored&quot;.

<text>State Route 513 (SR 513) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Washington, located entirely within the city of Seattle in King County. The highway travels north as Montlake Boulevard from an interchange with SR 520 and over the Montlake Bridge to the University of Washington campus in the University District. SR 513 continues past University Village before it turns northeast onto Sand Point Way and ends at the entrance to Magnuson Park in the Sand Point neighborhood.

SR 513 was created during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to Secondary State Highway 1J (SSH 1J), itself created in 1937 and traveling from Downtown Seattle to Lake City. Sections of SSH 1J, including Madison Street from Downtown to Capitol Hill, date as far back as 1854. Most sections of the highway were built in the 1890s and 1900s in preparation for the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition, which took place on the University of Washington campus in 1909. SR 513 was shortened in 1971 to its present southern terminus, the interchange with SR 520 in Montlake, and to an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) on the Seattle–Shoreline city border. In 1991, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus at Magnuson Park, eliminating its route through Lake City and much of North Seattle.

==Route description==
SR 513 begins at the intersection of Montlake Boulevard and Lake Washington Boulevard in the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle, part of a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 520. The highway travels north on Montlake Boulevard and crosses the Montlake Cut section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal on the Montlake Bridge. The bascule drawbridge is designated as a city landmark and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982. SR 513 continues north through the University of Washington campus within the University District and passes Husky Stadium and the campus light rail station before being joined by the Burke-Gilman Trail near the Hec Edmundson Pavilion. The highway turns east onto 45th Street and Sand Point Way at the University Village shopping mall and enters the Sand Point neighborhood near Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital. SR 513 continues northeast along the Burke-Gilman Trail past the Seattle branch of the National Archives before the highway ends at an intersection with 65th Street west of Magnuson Park.

Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 513 was within the University of Washington campus, serving 41,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was its northern terminus at Magnuson Park, serving 14,000 vehicles. The entire route of SR 513 is part of the National Highway System, identifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
SSH 1J, the predecessor to SR 513, was added to the state highway system in 1937 and traveled within the city of Seattle on streets that have existed since the 19th century. Madison Street, which carried SSH 1J from its southern terminus at U.S. Route 99 in Downtown to Capitol Hill was built in 1864 by local judge John J. McGilvra to connect his homestead at Madison Park to downtown. Other streets carrying SSH 1J, including 23rd and 24th Avenues towards Montlake, Montlake Boulevard through the University District, and Sand Point Way towards Sand Point were built during the early 1890s as the city of Seattle expanded. The rest of SSH 1J, traveling northwest from Naval Station Puget Sound at Sand Point through Lake City to US 99 on the border between Seattle and Shoreline via Roosevelt Way and 145th Street was constructed by the late 1800s to serve the University of Washington campus, site of the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909.

SSH 1J was replaced by SR 513 during the 1964 state highway renumbering and codified in 1970 on its original route, connecting Downtown Seattle to Montlake and Lake City. In 1971, SR 513 was shortened to by moving its southern terminus to an interchange with SR 520 in Montlake and its northern terminus to an interchange with I-5 at 145th Street. The highway was further shortened, to its present length of , in 1991 by moving its northern terminus from I-5 to Magnuson Park at the site of the former Naval Station Puget Sound.

A project to rebuild the Montlake interchange with SR 520 began in 2019 as part of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge megaproject, which had begun earlier in the decade. The east side of the interchange was covered by a highway lid and lanes of Montlake Boulevard were shifted over to it while the original overpass was demolished. The new overpass opened in July 2023; additional ramps to SR 520 for high-occupancy vehicles from the interchnage are planned to open in 2024.

<text>Miss Machine is the second studio album by American mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan released in July 2004 through Relapse Records. It is the first album by the band to feature vocalist Greg Puciato and bassist Liam Wilson. &quot;Miss Machine&quot; marks a change to a more experimental style by the band.

The album is The Dillinger Escape Plan&#x27;s first album since 1999, the gap between albums being accredited to a number of bad fortunes, and a short EP release with lead vocals being performed by Mike Patton. There were three music videos made for the album (&quot;Panasonic Youth&quot;, &quot;Unretrofied&quot;, and &quot;Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants&quot;) directed by Neurosis&#x27; Josh Graham. The band decided to feature metalcore producer Steve Evetts to produce the album. &quot;Unretrofied&quot; was featured in &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006.&quot;

==Musical direction==
Until the band&#x27;s 2007 release of the further groundbreaking &quot;Ire Works&quot;, &quot;Miss Machine&quot; was considerably the band&#x27;s most experimental release to date, as the band drew from the experience of working with Mike Patton and the industrial influence of bands such as Nine Inch Nails. It is also arguably their most accessible due to the band toning down the musical complexity and adding new elements like slower song tempos, singing vocals, and more straightforward song structures.

Due to Mike Patton collaborating with the band, his experimental influences began to rub off on The Dillinger Escape Plan. In addition, Greg Puciato was involved with Error, an industrial band, around the same time as the release of &quot;Miss Machine&quot;, all of which would form their sound on &quot;Miss Machine&quot;. The album turned out to be much more experimental, and include many more jazz-fusion elements and electronics. Weinman&#x27;s guitars were not as prominent in the mix, and Pennie&#x27;s drumming was not as demanding.

Andrew Racher of Brooklyn Vegan said calling the album mathcore was &quot;too niche&quot; and &quot;undersells it.&quot; He described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;progressive circus acid freakout avant-goth metallic rock.&quot;

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
The critical reception for &quot;Miss Machine&quot; was relatively favorable, with Allmusic going so far as to say, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing more to say — the next true image of rock &amp; roll has crawled out of the swamps of Jersey.&quot; Despite being positive in their review, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noticed &quot;Though Miss Machine displays DEP in top musical form, the band seems to have lost its confidence and direction.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, however, was negative, noticing &quot;unless you&#x27;re trying to drive a third world dictator out of his barricaded palace, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to listen to &quot;Miss Machine&quot; in its entirety.&quot; &quot;Miss Machine&quot; has earned a metascore of 80 on review aggregate site Metacritic indicating favorable reviews.

<doc id="845960" wikidata="Q1249814" url="?curid=845960" title="Prehistoric Scotland">
<text>Archaeology and geology continue to reveal the secrets of prehistoric Scotland, uncovering a complex past before the Romans brought Scotland into the scope of recorded history. Successive human cultures tended to be spread across Europe or further afield, but focusing on this particular geographical area sheds light on the origin of the widespread remains and monuments in Scotland, and on the background to the history of Scotland.

The extent of open countryside untouched by intensive farming, together with past availability of stone rather than timber, has given Scotland a wealth of accessible sites where the ancient past can be seen.

==The remote prehistory of Scotland==

Scotland is geologically alien to Europe, comprising a sliver of the ancient continent of Laurentia (which later formed the bulk of North America). During the Cambrian period the crustal region which became Scotland formed part of the continental shelf of Laurentia, then still south of the equator. Laurentia was separated from the continent of Baltica (which later became Scandinavia and the Baltic region) by the diminishing Iapetus Ocean. The two ancient continents moved toward one another through the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, with tectonic folding during the Silurian pushing the first Scottish land above water. The final collision occurred during the Devonian period, with the Scottish segment of the Laurentian plate smashing into Avalonia (which contained what is now most of England and Wales), a motile subcontinent which had previously joined with Baltica. This impact threw up a massive chain of mountains (at least as tall as the present-day Alps) and saw the formation of the granitic West Highland and Grampian mountain chains and (through the Carboniferous) a period of volcanic activity in central and eastern Scotland. During the Permian and Triassic periods, with the Iapetus Ocean entirely closed, Scotland lay near the centre of the Pangaean supercontinent. At the start of the Tertiary, a constructive plate boundary (at which tectonic plates move apart) became active between Laurentia and Eurasia, pushing the two apart (and parting Scotland from Laurentia). This recession opened the Atlantic Ocean for the first time, and the consequent subduction zone at the western plate margin led to a renewed period of volcanism, this time on Scotland&#x27;s west coast, producing fresh mountains on Skye, Jura, Mull, Rùm, and Arran.

This tectonic activity produced the basis of Scotland&#x27;s topography: ancient mountains in the North and South of the country, partially eroded by 400 million years of water and ice with a wide fertile valley between them, and a newer, wilder western terrain. With Scotland now in the northern temperate zone, it was subjected to numerous glaciations in the Neogene and Quaternary periods, the ice sheets and their attendant glaciers carving the landscape into a typical postglacial one, overdeepening river valleys into the characteristic U-shape and leaving the upland areas covered with glacial corries and dramatic pyramidal peaks. In lowland areas the ice deposited rich fields of fertile glacial till and eroded the softer material surrounding the extinct volcanoes (particularly the older Carboniferous ones), leaving many crags.

==Before modern humans==
During the last interglacial, around 130,000–70,000 BC, there were times when the climate in Europe was warmer than it is today, and after the Neanderthals came to prominence there was another mild spell around 40,000 BC. Neanderthal sites have been found in the south of England from this era, though no traces of early modern humans have been found. Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, may have destroyed traces of human habitation that existed before the Mesolithic period.

Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and it was only after the ice retreated about 15,000 years ago that Scotland again became habitable.

==Hunter-gatherers==
As the climate improved, mesolithic hunter-gatherers extended their range into Scotland. The earliest evidence to date is the flint artefacts found at Howburn Farm, near Elsrickle in 2005. This is the first and so far the only evidence of Upper Paleolithic human habitation in Scotland, around 12,000 BC, which appears to fall between the Younger Dryas and Lomond Stadial periods when cold conditions returned relatively briefly.

An early settlement at Cramond, near what is today Edinburgh, has been dated to around 8500 BC. Pits and stakeholes suggest a hunter-gatherer encampment, and microlith stone tools made at the site predate finds of similar style in England. Although no bones or shells had survived in the acidic soils, numerous carbonised hazelnut shells indicate cooking in a similar way to finds at other Mesolithic period sites, including the slightly earlier Star Carr and the Howick house in Northumberland, dated to 7600 BC (&quot;Britain&#x27;s oldest house&quot;), where post holes indicate a very substantial construction, interpreted as a permanent residence for hunting people. This suggests that hunter-gatherers could also have settled down in Scotland.

Other sites on the east coast and at lochs and rivers, and large numbers of rock shelters and shell middens around the west coast and islands, build up a picture of highly mobile people, often using sites seasonally and having boats for fishing and for transporting stone tools from sites where suitable materials were found. Finds of flint tools on Ben Lawers and at Glen Dee (a mountain pass through the Cairngorms) show that these people were capable of travelling well inland across the hills.

At a rock shelter and shell midden at Sand, Applecross in Wester Ross facing Skye, excavations have shown that around 7500 BC people had tools of bone, stone and antlers, were living off shellfish, fish, and deer using &quot;pot boiler&quot; stones as a cooking method, were making beads from seashells, and had ochre pigment and used shellfish which can produce purple dye.

==Farmers and monument builders==

Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements. At Balbridie in Aberdeenshire crop markings were investigated, and ditches and post holes found, revealing a massive timber-framed building dating to about 3600 BC. An almost identical building, with evidence of pottery, was excavated at Claish near Stirling. On the islet of Eilean Domhnuill, in Loch Olabhat on North Uist, Unstan ware pottery suggests a date of 3200–2800 BC for what may be the earliest crannog. Neolithic habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.

The remainder of this section focuses mainly on the Orkney Islands, where there is a Neolithic landscape rich in sites amazingly preserved by prevalent use of the local stone which appears on the shore ready-split into convenient building slabs. There are many other examples across the country, many under the care of Historic Scotland.

At the stone house at Knap of Howar on the Orkney island of Papa Westray (occupied from 3500 BC to 3100 BC) the walls stand to a low eaves height, and the stone furniture is intact. Evidence from middens shows that the inhabitants kept cattle, sheep and pigs, farmed barley and wheat and gathered shellfish, as well as fishing for species which must be caught from boats using lines. Finely made and decorated Unstan ware pottery links the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield, including Balbrindi and Eilean Domhnuill.

The houses at Skara Brae on the Mainland of the Orkney Islands are very similar, but are grouped into a village linked by low passageways. This settlement was occupied from about 3000 BC to 2500 BC. Pottery found here is of the grooved ware style which is found across Britain as far away as Wessex.

About 6 miles (10 km) from Skara Brae, grooved ware pottery was found at the Standing Stones of Stenness (originally a circle) which lie centrally in a close group of three major monuments. Maeshowe, the finest example of the passage grave type of chambered cairn (radiocarbon dated to before 2700 BC) lies just to the east. The Ring of Brodgar circle of standing stones is across a bridge immediately to the north. This circle was one of the first to be analysed by Professor Alexander Thom to establish the likely use of standing stones as astronomical observatories. Another Neolithic village has been found nearby at Barnhouse Settlement, and the inference is that these farming people were the builders and users of these mysterious structures.

Like the standing stones at Callanish on Lewis and other standing stones across Scotland, these monuments form part of the Europe-wide Megalithic culture which also produced Stonehenge in Wiltshire and the stone rows at Carnac in Brittany.

Further evidence can be found in Kilmartin Glen with its Stone Circles, Standing Stones and Rock Art.

The widespread connections of these people are shown by offerings imported from Cumbria and Wales and left on the sacred hilltop at Cairnpapple Hill, West Lothian, as early as 3500 BC.

==Bronze Age==
The cairns and megalithic monuments continued into the Bronze Age, though there was a decline in both the building of large new structures and the total area under cultivation.

The Clava cairns and standing stones near Inverness show complex geometries and astronomical alignments, with smaller, perhaps individual, tombs instead of the communal Neolithic tombs.

Mummies dating from 1600 to 1300 BC have been discovered at Cladh Hallan on South Uist.

Hill forts were introduced, such as Eildon Hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, which goes back to around 1000 BC and which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop. Excavation at Edinburgh Castle found late Bronze Age material from about 850 BC.

==Iron Age==

From around 700 BC and extending into Roman times, the Iron Age was an age of forts and defended farmsteads, which support the image of quarrelsome tribes and petty kingdoms recorded by the Romans. Evidence that at times occupants neglected the defences might suggest that symbolic power was as significant as warfare.

Brythonic (or &quot;Pritennic&quot;) Celtic culture and language spread into southern Scotland at some time after the 8th century BC, possibly through cultural contact rather than mass invasion, and systems of kingdoms developed.

Larger fortified settlements expanded, such as the Votadini stronghold of Traprain Law, East Lothian, which was the size of a town. Huge numbers of small duns, hill forts and ring forts were built on any suitable crag or hillock. The spectacular brochs were built, most impressively the nearly complete Mousa Broch, Shetland. Many Souterrain underground passageways were constructed, though their purpose is obscure. Island settlements linked with land by a causeway, the crannogs, became common; it is thought that their function was defensive.

<text>Silent Holocaust (, sometimes called &quot;another holocaust&quot; or a &quot;second holocaust&quot;) is a controversial expression that has been used with various meanings, and is used by certain Jewish communal and religious leaders to describe Jewish assimilation (cultural assimilation, religious assimilation) and interfaith marriages between Jews and gentiles. The term compares the resulting demographic effects (decrease in the Jewish population) to the Holocaust of Europe&#x27;s Jews during World War II resulting in the genocide of six million Jews. Communal leaders, such as Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald of the National Jewish Outreach Program, popularized the phrase.

The word silent is meant to evoke a state of shock due to the fact that millions of Jews are freely choosing to leave Judaism. For some, the loss of millions of Jewish coreligionists is deemed serious enough to be called a holocaust (meaning a &quot;wholesale sacrifice or destruction&quot;.)

Some Jewish communal leaders, such as Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald of the National Jewish Outreach Program in New York, refer to the assimilation of Jews into non-Jewish societies as a type of Holocaust. Since World War II, assimilation has been the leading cause of Jewish population decline in Western countries. Buchwald said in 1992 that the Jewish community would not be recognizable in 25 to 30 years. According to the 2000—2001 National Jewish Population Survey, from 1996, 47% of American Jews married a non-Jew. The NJPS survey claims that higher levels of education are associated with lower levels of intermarriage.

<text>The Edmonton Eskimos were a Canadian amateur and later professional men&#x27;s ice hockey team that existed from 1911 to 1927. After playing in senior hockey in the Alberta-based Big-4 League, the Eskimos joined the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) for the inaugural 1921–22 WCHL season, and played for the Stanley Cup against the Ottawa Senators in the 1923 Stanley Cup Finals, as the WCHL Champions. Team alumni include Hockey Hall of Fame members Eddie Shore, Duke Keats and Bullet Joe Simpson.

While the Edmonton Eskimos disbanded after the 1926–27 season, the name was adopted by a new team in 1932–33, playing for four years before it disbanded. The name was adopted by another new team for a single 1938–39 season.

==History==
The Eskimos club was formed for the 1909–10 season by Edmonton sports promoter William Deacon White, from the remains of the amateur Edmonton Hockey Club, and inherited its predecessor&#x27;s membership in the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association (AAHA). In 1909–10 and 1911–12 the club was loosely known as the &quot;Edmonton Deacons&quot;, after Deacon White. Prior to the 1911–12 season the team officially adopted the name Edmonton Eskimos, influenced by Deacon White&#x27;s Edmonton Esquimaux rugby football club. The early Eskimos played in the Thistle Rink, until it burned down in 1912.

In 1919–20, the AAHA formed the &quot;Big Four&quot; senior league, composed of two teams in Edmonton, and two in Calgary. This league folded in 1921, and the Eskimos helped to found the Western Canada Hockey League, with Ken McKenzie as their head coach.

The Eskimos were the WCHL regular season champion for the inaugural 1921–22 WCHL season, finishing second in the 1921–22 playoffs. The Eskimos repeated as regular season champion in the 1922–23 WCHL season, then defeated the Regina Capitals to win the 1922–23 WCHL playoff championship. The team then played in the 1923 Stanley Cup Finals against the Ottawa Senators. The Regina Capitals moved to Portland, Oregon, in the summer of 1925, leading to the WCHL renaming itself the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Eskimos won their third regular season championship in the single 1925–26 WHL season, finishing second in that season&#x27;s playoffs.

The WHL disbanded after the 1925–26 season, and the Eskimos joined other WHL teams, plus some new franchises, to form the Prairie Hockey League, with the Eskimos finished last of the five teams in the inaugural 1926–27 PHL season. The Eskimos disbanded at that end of that season.

== Later incarnations ==
The name Edmonton Eskimos was adopted by an amateur senior team that played in the Western Canada Hockey League in 1932–33, which was re-formed as the North West Hockey League (NWHL) for the 1933–34 season. This Eskimos team disbanded after the 1935–36 NWHL season.

The name was adopted by a team that played in the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL) in 1938–39.

<doc id="845974" wikidata="Q228867" url="?curid=845974" title="Zulu (1964 film)">
<text>Zulu is a 1964 British epic historical drama film depicting the 1879 Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift between a detachment of the British Army and the Zulu, in the Anglo-Zulu War. The film was directed and co-written by American screenwriter Cy Endfield. He had moved to the United Kingdom in 1951 for work after being blacklisted in Hollywood. It was produced by Stanley Baker and Endfield, with Joseph E. Levine as executive producer. The screenplay was by Endfield and historical writer John Prebble, based on Prebble&#x27;s 1958 &quot;Lilliput&quot; article &quot;Slaughter in the Sun&quot;. 

The film stars Stanley Baker and introduces Michael Caine in his first major role, with a supporting cast that includes Jack Hawkins, Ulla Jacobsson, James Booth, Nigel Green, Paul Daneman, Glynn Edwards, Ivor Emmanuel, and Patrick Magee. Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi (a future South African political leader) played Zulu King Cetshwayo kaMpande, his great-grandfather. The opening and closing narration is spoken by Richard Burton.

First shown on the 85th anniversary of the battle, 22 January 1964, at the Plaza Theatre in the West End of London, &quot;Zulu&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its sets, soundtrack, cinematography, action sequences, and the cast&#x27;s performances, particularly Baker, Booth, Green, and Caine. The film brought Caine international fame. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers, and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked it as the 93rd best British film ever.

==Plot==

In January 1879, in the aftermath of the crushing defeat of a 1,300-man British column by the Zulu armies at Isandlwana, Zulu warriors scavenge the battlefield and collect rifles and ammunition from the dead soldiers. At a mass Zulu marriage ceremony witnessed by missionary Otto Witt and his daughter Margareta, Zulu King Cetshwayo is informed of the great victory. Witt and Margareta flee to their missionary station when they realise that the Zulu are going to attack the remote outpost at Rorke&#x27;s Drift in Natal. A company of the British Army&#x27;s 24th Regiment of Foot are using the station as a supply depot and hospital for British forces in Zululand.

Receiving news of Isandlwana from Natal Native Contingent Commander Adendorff and warnings that a force of 4,000 Zulu warriors are advancing on their position, Lieutenant John Chard of the Royal Engineers assumes command of a force consisting of some 150 men, 30 of whom are sick and wounded, as he is slightly senior to their nominal commander, Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. With not enough time to order a full evacuation, Chard decides to stay and fight. He has wagons, sacks of mealie (maize), and crates of hardtack stacked to form a defensive perimeter, gun holes knocked in the hospital walls, and a medical ward set up in Witt&#x27;s chapel. A contingent of South African cavalrymen from Isandlwana arrive, refuse Chard&#x27;s pleas to help reinforce the station on the grounds that it is hopeless, and swiftly depart on their horses. Enraged by Chard arming the hospital&#x27;s patients and ordering them to fight instead of allowing them to be evacuated, the minister Witt persuades the Zulus serving in the Natal Native Contingent to desert. Chard orders the wagons to be overturned to plug gaps in the barrier and orders for Witt to be locked in the chapel&#x27;s supply room.

The Zulu &quot;impis&quot; approach and charge but quickly retreat under British fire; Adendorff explains that they are trying to find weak points in the station&#x27;s defences. Witt starts drinking heavily and proclaims that none of the soldiers will survive the coming battle. Chard permits Margareta to take her father away; the Zulus let them pass. Chard is concerned that the northern perimeter wall is under-defended and realises that the Zulus, aware of this, are preparing to attack the station from all sides. Zulus armed with British rifles start firing at the soldiers. Throughout the day and night, wave after wave of Zulu attackers are repelled, but some defenders are killed and wounded. The hospital&#x27;s hay roof catches fire and the whole building is engulfed; Private Henry Hook rallies the patients to fight attacking warriors and escape. Sergeant Robert Maxfield, Hook&#x27;s mentally broken commanding NCO, is killed as the hospital burns down.

The next morning, a large number of Zulus approach to within several hundred yards and sing a lament for their dead before launching again into their war chant. The British respond by singing the Welsh song &quot;Men of Harlech&quot;. In the final assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a small redoubt in front of the chapel. With a reserve of men hidden within the redoubt, they form into three ranks and fire volley after volley, inflicting heavy casualties; the Zulus retreat. After a pause of three hours, the Zulus re-form on the Oscarberg. Resigned to another assault, the British are astonished when the massed Zulu sing a song to honour the defenders&#x27; bravery and depart. The exhausted British begin recuperating as Chard plants a Zulu shield in the ground.

==Production==

Cy Endfield was inspired to make the film after reading an article on the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift by John Prebble. He took it to actor Stanley Baker, with whom he had made several films and who was interested in moving into production. Endfield and Prebble drafted a script, which Baker showed to Joseph E. Levine while making &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; (1962) in Italy. Levine agreed to fund the movie, which Baker&#x27;s company, Diamond Films, produced. It was shot using the Super Technirama 70 cinematographic process, and distributed by Paramount Pictures in all countries excluding the United States, where it was distributed by Embassy Pictures.

Most of &quot;Zulu&quot; was shot on location in South Africa. The mission depot at Rorke&#x27;s Drift was recreated beneath the natural Amphitheatre in the Drakensberg Mountains. (This landscape was more precipitous and dramatic than the real Rorke&#x27;s Drift, which is little more than two small hills). The set for the British field hospital and supply depot was created near the Tugela River with the Amphitheatre in the background. The real location of the battle was 100 kilometres (60 mi) to the northeast, on the Buffalo River near the isolated hill at Isandlwana.

Other scenes were filmed within the national parks of the then Province of Natal. Interiors and all the scenes starring James Booth were completed at Twickenham Film Studios in Middlesex, England. The majority of the Zulu warriors were real Zulus. The 240 Zulu extras who were employed for the battle scenes, were bused in from their tribal homes more than 100 miles away. Around 1,000 additional tribesmen were filmed by the second unit in Zululand. Eighty South African military servicemen were cast as soldiers.

The film was compared by Baker to a Western movie, with the traditional roles of the United States Cavalry and Native Americans taken by the British and the Zulu, respectively. Director Endfield showed a Western to Zulu extras to demonstrate the concept of film acting and how he wanted the warriors to conduct themselves.

It has been rumoured that due to the apartheid laws in South Africa, none of the Zulu extras could be paid for his performance. Endfield was said to have circumvented this restriction by leaving them all the animals, primarily cattle, that were used in the film. These are highly valued in their society. This allegation is incorrect; no such law existed and all the Zulu extras were paid in full. The main body of extras were paid the equivalent of nine shillings per day each, additional extras eight shillings, and the female dancers slightly less.

Michael Caine, who was primarily playing bit parts at this early stage in his career, was originally up for the role of Private Henry Hook, which went to James Booth. According to Caine, he was extremely nervous during his screen test for the part of Bromhead. Director Cy Endfield told him that it was the worst screen test he had ever seen, but they cast Caine in the part anyway because the production was leaving for South Africa shortly and they had not found anyone else for the role. Caine said that he was fortunate that the film was directed by an American (Endfield), because &quot;no English director would&#x27;ve cast me as an officer, I promise you, not one,&quot; due to his Cockney roots. Most officers at the time were from upper-class families. Caine later said &quot;My entire movie career is based on the length of the bar at the Prince of Wales theatre, because I was on my way out [after failing to get the part auditioned for] and it was a very long walk to the door. And I had just got there, when he called out: &#x27;Come back!&#x27;

The company was unable to obtain enough historically authentic Martini-Henry rifles for all of the extras, and had to make up the difference with later Lee Enfields. These have a very noticeable moving bolt on the right side, absent on the Martini-Henry. The sidearms used were also visibly later types, World War I-vintage Webley Mk VI revolvers.

The budget of the film has been the subject of some speculation. Press-related figures of $3 million and even $3.5 million were mentioned upon the picture&#x27;s American release. Joseph E. Levine later revealed that Stanley Baker had approached him with a script and budget in 1962, just after filming &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;. Levine agreed to finance the picture up to $2 million. According to the records of the British completion bond company, Film Finance, Ltd., the production eventually finalized its budget at £666,554 (approximately, $1,720,000). This included a contingency amount of £82,241, of which only £34,563 had been used by the time the picture had all but wrapped post-production (Cost Report #15, 18 October 1963). This would have placed the near-final negative cost at £618,876 (approximately $1,600,000).

==Historical accuracy==
The basic premises of the film are true and largely accurate, but some characters are fictionalised or bear little resemblance to their real life counterparts. The vastly outnumbered British did successfully defend Rorke&#x27;s Drift, more or less as portrayed in the film. Writer and director Cy Endfield consulted a Zulu tribal historian for information from Zulu oral tradition about the attack. Some events are created for dramatic effect.

===The regiment===
*The film presents the 24th Regiment of Foot as a predominantly Welsh regiment, which was not the case in 1879. Of the soldiers present at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, 49 were English, 32 Welsh, 16 Irish, and 22 others of indeterminate ethnicity. While the regiment had been based at Brecon in South Wales for several years, its full name at the time was 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot. (In 1881, the regiment assumed its later name of South Wales Borderers.) 
*The song &quot;Men of Harlech&quot; features prominently as the regimental song; it did not achieve that status until later. At the time of the battle, the regimental song was &quot;The Warwickshire Lad&quot;. No &quot;battlefield singing contest&quot; took place between the British and the Zulu.

===The Witts===
The historical record concerning the Swedish missionaries, the Witts, has inconsistencies, though the minister in the film is portrayed quite differently than the historical Witt. The real man was younger, married and with children, a teetotaler and not a pacifist. Otto Witt&#x27;s wife and children were away at the time of the battle. No pacifist, Witt had co-operated closely with the British Army and earlier negotiated a lease to put Rorke&#x27;s Drift at Lord Chelmsford&#x27;s disposal. Witt clarified that he did not oppose British intervention against King Cetshwayo. Witt had stayed at Rorke&#x27;s Drift because he wished &quot;to take part in the defence of my own house and at the same time in the defence of an important place for the whole colony, yet my thoughts went to my wife and to my children, who were at a short distance from there, and did not know anything of what was going on&quot;. On the morning of the battle, Otto Witt, with the chaplain, George Smith, and Surgeon-Major James Henry Reynolds, had ascended Shiyane (Oscarberg), the large hill near the station, and noticed the approach of the large Zulu force across the Buffalo River. Given his family at a distance, he left on horseback before the battle in order to join them.

===The men of the regiment===
* Lieutenants John Chard and Gonville Bromhead: Chard received his commission in February 1868, before Bromhead. The latter was the junior officer and second-in-command at the Drift although he was an infantryman (who usually took command) and Chard was an engineer. The film says that Bromhead received his commission three months after Chard but, in fact, he did not receive it until three years after Chard.
* Surgeon Reynolds: During the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Reynolds went around the barricades, distributing ammunition and tending to the wounded, actions not shown in the film. During the closing voiceover, he is incorrectly referred to as &quot;Surgeon-Major, Army Hospital Corps&quot;. Reynolds was of the Army Medical Department, and was not promoted to the rank of Surgeon-Major until after the action at Rorke&#x27;s Drift. The pacifism apparent in Magee&#x27;s portrayal is not based on the historical Surgeon Reynolds.
* Private Henry Hook, VC, is depicted as a rogue with a penchant for alcohol; in fact, he was a model soldier who later was promoted to sergeant; he was also a teetotaller. Historically he had been assigned to the hospital specifically to guard the building. The real Hook&#x27;s daughters were reportedly so disgusted at his portrayal that they walked out of the 1964 London premiere; a campaign was organized to have Hooks&#x27;s documented historical reputation restored. The film&#x27;s producers said they chose Hook by chance and created the character as seen in the film, simply because &quot;they wanted an anti-hero who would come good under pressure&quot;.
* Corporal William Allen is depicted as a model soldier; historically he had recently been demoted from sergeant for drunkenness.
* Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne (1854–1945) is a middle-aged, big and hardened veteran. In fact, he was of modest stature and, aged 24, the youngest colour sergeant in the British Army. He was called &quot;The Kid&quot; by his men. Colour Sergeant Bourne would not have worn medals on his duty uniform. Moreover, Green&#x27;s costume has the chevrons on the wrong arm. After the battle, Bourne was offered a commission but turned it down because he lacked the money necessary to serve as a commissioned officer; he finally accepted a commission in 1890. He was the last British survivor of the Battle and a full colonel upon his death in 1945.
* Padre George Smith (&quot;Ammunition&quot; Smith), the chaplain, is not a character in the film, although he won a Victoria Cross for his actions.
* Corporal Christian Ferdinand Schiess was 22, significantly younger than the actor who portrayed him. 
* The detachment of cavalry from &quot;Durnford&#x27;s Horse&quot; who ride up to the mission station were members of the Natal Native Contingent. Historically this was chiefly composed of black African cavalrymen, rather than the purported local white farmers depicted as a kind of militia in the film. The members of the NNC were present at the opening of the battle, but left as they had very little ammunition for their cavalry carbines. Captain Stephenson is depicted at their head; in reality, he was leading the NNC infantry, which had already deserted.
* The uniforms of the Natal Native Contingent are inaccurate: NNC troops were not issued with European-style clothes. Only their European officers wore makeshift uniforms. The rank and file wore traditional tribal garb topped by a red rag worn around the forehead (as correctly depicted in the 1979 film, &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;, about the battle of Isandlwana.) The story of their desertion is true. Witt left before they did. They left of their own accord, along with Captain Stephenson and his European NCOs. These deserters were fired at as they left and one of their NCOs, Corporal Anderson, was killed. Stephenson was later convicted of desertion at a court-martial and dismissed from the army.

===The Zulu===
King Cetshwayo did not order the attack on the mission station, as the film suggests. Cetshwayo had specifically told his warriors not to invade Natal, the British colony. The attack was led by Prince Dabulamanzi kaMpande, the King&#x27;s half-brother, who pursued fleeing survivors at Isandlwana across the river and moved on to attack Rorke&#x27;s Drift. Although the defenders fired almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition, just under 400 Zulus were killed at Rorke&#x27;s Drift. A similar number were left behind when the Zulu retreated, as they were too badly wounded to move. Comments from veterans many years after the event suggest the British killed many of these wounded men in the battle&#x27;s aftermath, raising the total number of Zulu deaths to more than 700.

===Battle===
At roughly 7 am following the day of battle, an Impi appeared, prompting the British to man their positions again. No attack materialised, as the Zulu had been on the move for six days prior to the battle. Their ranks included hundreds of wounded, and they were several days&#x27; march from any supplies.

Around 8 am, another force appeared. The defenders abandoned their breakfast and took up their positions again. The approaching troops were the vanguard of Lord Chelmsford&#x27;s relief column.

The Zulu did not sing a song saluting fellow warriors and departed at the approach of the British relief column. This sequence has been both praised for showing the Zulus in a positive light and treating them and the British as equals, and criticised as undermining any anti-imperial message of the film.

==Reception==
On its initial release in 1964, &quot;Zulu&quot; received acclaim from critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;if you&#x27;re not too squeamish at the sight of slaughter and blood and can keep your mind fixed on the notion that there was something heroic and strong about British colonial expansion in the 19th century, you may find a great deal of excitement in this robustly Kiplingesque film. For certainly the fellows who made it, Cy Endfield and Stanley Baker, have done about as nifty a job of realizing on the formula as one could do.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised the &quot;intelligent screenplay&quot; and &quot;high allround standard of acting,&quot; concluding, &quot;High grade technical qualities round off a classy production.&quot;

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;in the much-missed tradition of &#x27;Beau Geste&#x27; and &#x27;Four Feathers.&#x27; It has a restrained, leisurely tension, the heroics are splendidly stiff-upper-lip and such granite worthies as Stanley Baker and Jack Hawkins head the cast.&quot;

Whitney Balliett of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the film had &quot;not only refurbished all the clichés of the genre but given them the sheen of high style ... It has already been pointed out that &#x27;Zulu&#x27; is in poor taste. But so are such invaluable relics as G. A. Henty and Rider Haggard and Kipling.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called &quot;Zulu&quot; &quot;a typically fashionable war film, paying dutiful lip service to the futility of the slaughter while milking it for thrills. And the battle, which occupies the whole second half of the film, is unquestionably thrilling ... But whenever there is a pause in the action the script plunges relentlessly into bathos, with feuding officers, comic other ranks, and all the other trappings of British War Film Mark I, which one had hoped were safely obsolete.&quot;

Caine&#x27;s performance won him praise from reviewers. His next film role would be as the star of &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, in which he was reunited with Nigel Green.

The film was one of the biggest box-office hits of all time in the British market. For the next 12 years, it remained in constant cinema circulation before its first television appearance. It became a television perennial and remains beloved by the British public.

Rotten Tomatoes gives a score of 96% based on reviews from 27 critics. The consensus summarizes: &quot;&quot;Zulu&quot; patiently establishes a cast of colorful characters and insurmountable stakes before unleashing its white-knuckle spectacle, delivering an unforgettable war epic in the bargain.&quot;

Among more modern assessments, Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews gave the film four out of five stars, while Brazilian reviewer Pablo Villaça of &quot;Cinema em Cena&quot; (Cinema Scene) gave the film three stars out of five. Dennis Schwartz of Ozus Movie Reviews praised Caine&#x27;s performance, calling it &quot;one of his most splendid hours on film&quot; and graded the film &#x27;A&#x27;.

When released in Apartheid South Africa in 1964, the film was banned for black audiences (as the government feared that its scenes of blacks killing whites might incite them to violence). The government allowed a few special screenings for its Zulu extras in Durban and some smaller Kwazulu towns.

By 2007, critics were polarised over whether the movie was anti-imperialist or racist.

Chris McEneany gave the film 8 out of 10 stars.

In 2010, Alex von Tunzelmann of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film a grade of B, saying: &quot;The Zulus are a mystery, the Welsh are misplaced, a Victoria Cross recipient is slandered, and no one has enough facial hair. Nonetheless, Zulu is a brilliantly made dramatisation of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, and it does a fine job of capturing the spirit for which the battle is remembered.&quot;

In 2014, Pat Reid of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, describing &quot;Zulu&quot; &quot;As a spectacular war film with a powerful moral dimension…Like the defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift itself, its legend grows with the passing of time.&quot; &quot;Cinema Retro&quot; released a special issue dedicated to &quot;Zulu&quot;, which detailed the production and filming of the film. Stating that the film &quot;has lost none of its impact over the years&quot;, it praises the battle sequences, calling them &quot;impressively staged&quot; and the portrayal of the Zulus &quot;as noble figures who develop a mutual respect for the British, even as they are trying to kill them&quot;. It also praises the &quot;particularly impressive&quot; performances of the supporting cast of Hawkins, Jacobbsson, and Magee.

In a &quot;Telegraph&quot; article, Will Heaven wrote, &quot;&quot;Zulu&quot; is a story of real-life heroism seen through the lenses of Victorian propaganda and Hollywood epic cinema. It may not be truthful – but, my God, the result is thrilling.&quot;

In regards to the film&#x27;s attitudes on race, author Daniel O&#x27;Brien noted one of the Zulus killing one of their own to protect Witt&#x27;s daughter, and how Bromhead dismissing the native auxiliaries who died with the column at Isandhlwana, &quot;Damn the levies man – more cowardly blacks&quot;, is reprimanded by Adendorff.

In 2018, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi defended the film&#x27;s cultural and historical merits, stating that there&#x27;s a &quot;...deep respect that develops between the warring armies, and the nobility of King Cetshwayo&#x27;s warriors as they salute the enemy, demanded a different way of thinking from the average viewer at the time of the film&#x27;s release. Indeed, it remains a film that demands a thoughtful response.&quot; Buthelezi, with whom Baker had become friends with during production, described Baker as &quot;the finest white man he had ever met&quot;.

===Awards and honours===

Ernest Archer was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Colour Art Direction on the film. The magazine &quot;Total Film&quot; (2004) ranked &quot;Zulu&quot; the 37th greatest British movie of all time, and it was ranked eighth in the British television programme &quot;The 100 Greatest War Films&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Zulu&quot; 351st on their list of the 500 greatest films.

==Presentation format==
&quot;Zulu&quot; was filmed in Technirama and intended for presentation in Super Technirama 70, as shown on the prints. In the UK, however, the only 70mm screening was a press show prior to release. While the vast majority of cinemas would have played the film in 35mm anyway, the Plaza&#x27;s West End screenings were of the 35mm anamorphic version as well rather than, as might have been expected, a 70mm print. This was due to the UK&#x27;s film quota regulations, which demanded that cinemas show 30% British films during the calendar year, but the regulations only applied to 35mm presentations. By 1964, the number of British films available at cinemas like the Plaza could be limited, and &quot;Zulu&quot; gave them several weeks of British quota qualification if they were played in 35mm. In other countries, the public got to see films in 70mm.

==Home video releases==
In the US, a LaserDisc release by The Criterion Collection retains the original stereophonic soundtrack taken from a 70mm print.

An official DVD release (with a mono soundtrack as the original stereo tracks were not available) was later issued by StudioCanal through Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film was released on Blu-ray in the UK in 2008; this version is region-free. On 22 January 2014, the 50th anniversary of the film and the 135th anniversary of the actual battle, Twilight Time issued a limited-edition Blu-ray of &quot;Zulu&quot; in the US with John Barry&#x27;s score as an isolated track.

==Merchandising==
* A soundtrack album by John Barry featuring one side of the film score music and one side of &quot;Zulu Stamp&quot; was released on Ember Records in the UK and United Artists Records outside the Commonwealth.
* The choreographer Lionel Blair arranged a dance called the &quot;Zulu Stamp&quot; for Barry&#x27;s instrumentals.
* A comic book by Dell Comics was released to coincide with the film that features scenes and stills not in the completed film.
* Conte toy soldiers and playsets decorated with artwork and stills from the film were produced.

==Prequel==
Endfield later wrote &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; (1979), a prequel to the original film, depicting the Battle of Isandlwana. The battle&#x27;s aftermath was shown at the start of the first film.

==In popular culture==
* The Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep sequence in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; was filmed in a manner deliberately reminiscent of &quot;Zulu&quot;.
* &quot;Blood Bath at Orc&#x27;s Drift&quot; is a 1985 campaign supplement for the Games Workshop Warhammer Fantasy Battle (2nd edition) game, which pitted a small force of High Elves, Dwarfs, and Humans against an attacking army of Orcs. In 1997, Games Workshop again drew inspiration from &quot;Zulu&quot; for the &quot;Massacre at Big Toof River&quot;. In this event, Praetorian Guards, a faction based directly on late-19th century colonial English forces, faced off against Orc attackers, filling the role of the Zulus.
* Stanley Baker purchased John Chard&#x27;s Victoria Cross in 1972, believing it to be a replica. After Baker&#x27;s death, it was sold to a collector at a low price but found to be a genuine medal.
* Afrika Bambaataa said that he chose the name &quot;Zulu&quot; based on inspiration from the 1964 film. What Bambaataa &quot;saw in Zulu, were powerful images of Black solidarity.&quot; This would later inspire the name for his organisation, Universal Zulu Nation, in the 1970s.

<doc id="845975" wikidata="Q1452292" url="?curid=845975" title="Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation">
<text>The Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation (CPI(ML)L) is a communist political party in India. The party is represented in Bihar and Jharkhand Legislative Assemblies. Since 2023, the party is also a member of the INDIA bloc. In Bihar, the party has significant base amongst the Extremely Backward Castes and the Schedule Castes. It was successful in mobilising Upper Backward Caste groups such as Koeris in some districts of central Bihar, prior to the rise of Lalu Prasad Yadav. The party faced existential crisis when a large section of its Koeri and Yadav support base defected to Rashtriya Janata Dal in 1990s. However, the ideological commitment of its cadre protected it from disintegration. It staged a comeback in politics after winning twelve seats in Bihar Legislative Assembly in 2020 and by sending two of its members to Lok Sabha in 2024 Indian general elections.

== History ==
In 1973, the original Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) split, with one group led by Sharma and another by Mahadev Mukherjee. Vinod Mishra initially belonged to Mukherjee&#x27;s party, but he and the Burdwan Regional Committee broke with Mukherjee in September 1973. Mishra sought contact with the Sharma group, but the Burdwan Regional Committee was later divided and Mishra denounced the political line of Sharma (a critique, which amongst other things, called for the formation of open mass organizations, a move that almost constituted a heresy in the CPI (ML) movement at the time).

In 1974, Mishra came into contact with Subrata Dutta (Jauhar), a leader of armed struggle in the plain areas of Bihar. On 28 July 1974 (the second death anniversary of Charu Majumdar), a new party Central Committee was formed with Jauhar as General Secretary and Mishra and Swadesh Bhattacharya (Raghu) as members. The reorganized party became known as the &#x27;anti-Lin Biao&#x27; group (whilst the faction of Mahadev Mukherjee constituted the &#x27;pro-Lin Biao&#x27; group). The anti-Lin Biao group became known as the CPIML Liberation.

Mishra served as West Bengal secretary of the new party organization. Under Mishra&#x27;s leadership new &quot;dalams&quot; (guerilla squads) were formed.

In November 1975, Jauhar was killed during Lal Sena activities. Mishra became the new party General Secretary in a reorganized five-member Central Committee. Mishra organized a second party congress, held clandestinely in the rural areas of Gaya district in February 1976. The congress unanimously re-elected Mishra as General Secretary.

=== Reorientation and rectification ===
Mishra was the political architect of the process of re-orientation of CPIML Liberation. By 1976 the party had adopted a position that armed struggle would be combined with building a broad anti-Congress democratic front movement. The process was further elaborated through an internal rectification process initiated in late 1977. Party study circles and party schools were started from central to the block level of the party structure. The theory of two line tactics started to develop.

In 1981, the party tried to unify the other splintered ML factions. The party organised a unity meeting with 13 ML factions to form a unified leading core. However, the initiative was a failure.

==== The IPF ====
In the early 1980s, CPIML Liberation began building an open non-party mass movement (in direct to the original policy of CPI (ML)), the Indian People&#x27;s Front (founded in April 1982). Nagbhushan Patnaik became the president of IPF. The construction of IPF, through which the underground party could develop links to other democratic forces on the basis of a popular, democratic and patriotic programme, was based on interventions by Mishra. However, although Mishra broke with the dogmas of the early CPI (ML), he never renounced Charu Majumdar&#x27;s legacy.

In the third party congress, it was decided that IPF will participate in parliamentary elections. In 1989, IPF&#x27;s Rameshwar Prasad won the loksabha seat from Ara (Bhojpur). In 1990, IPF won seven seats from Bihar Legislative Assembly. Special initiatives taken for restructuring the party and open up. IPF hold its first rally on 8 October 1990 in Delhi.

CPIML&#x27;s mass base in the state of Bihar was among the members of Extremely Backward and Schedule Castes and it was initially unable to draw support for its activities from the upper backward castes. It was, however successful in mobilising the Koeris in the regions like Arrah, Rohtas, Patna and Aurangabad. This success remained temporary as with the formation of Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Koeri and Yadav support base of CPIML increasingly shifted its loyalty to the RJD. This was because plum posts in the party was offered by RJD to those detecting from the CPIML. During this period four legislators associated with Indian People&#x27;s Front, the open mass organisation of CPIML defected to the RJD. These were Shri Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha, K.D Yadav, Umesh Singh and Suryadev Singh. However, the party was saved from complete ruin by the presence of top leadership which was ideologically committed and belonged to social groups such as non -Yadav Other Backward Castes.

==== The ASDC ====
In 1985, the party launched People&#x27;s democratic Front (PDF) in Karbi Anglong district of Assam which won a seat in state assembly. In 1987 PDF was transformed to Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC). A sustained mass movement by ASDC help it to sweep district council elections in 1989. In 1981, ASDC&#x27;s Jayanta Rongpi became an MP in Parliament. In 1996, ASDC was able to send its five-member group in Assam assembly as MLA.

In 1992, after the Fifth party congress (Held in Kolkata), the party comes out in the open from its underground status. Mishra was re-elected General Secretary of the party at the sixth congress of CPIML Liberation in Varanasi in October 1997.

== Present ==

The CPIML(Liberation), led by Dipankar Bhattacharya is a surviving faction of the CPIML. Liberation has established legal overground structures (trade unions, student groups, peasant organisations etc.) and participates in elections. In the Lok Sabha elections in 1999 the party won 0.3% of the votes and one seat (the former ASDC-seat from Assam). In the 2004 elections the seat was lost, mainly due to a split within ASDC. As of 2016, the party has been able to send its representatives to the state legislative assemblies of Bihar and Jharkhand as well as the panchayats of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Punjab.

In November 2020, it won 12 seats in Bihar&#x27;s election. The legislators elected in this election to Bihar Legislative Assembly are:

In 2024, it was able to win two seats in from Bihar in Indian general election. The CPIMLL candidates, Raja Ram Singh Kushwaha and Sudama Prasad were able to defeat union minister R. K. Singh in Arrah Lok Sabha constituency and Upendra Kushwaha and Bhojpuri singer and actor Pawan Singh in Karakat Lok Sabha constituency. In a report, Dainik Bhaskar stated that the party is more strong than Indian National Congress in the state of Bihar, given its stellar performance in 2020 Bihar Legislative Assembly elections and 2024 Indian general elections. The party has supported the government of Nitish Kumar and Tejaswi Yadav from outside after 2020 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, however, its face has always been of a mass organisation working for the cause of poor. Many a times, it was seen protesting against its own government outside and inside the house of legislative assembly. The party was also praised for its ground level work amongst the downtrodden section of society and for winning the elections with bare minimum resources, when other political parties relied on heavy funding from the corporate for their election expenses.

CPIMLL has also showed significant presence in the regions such as Siwan and has been at the forefront in the fight against local landed magnates on the question of poor. It came into conflict with the gangster politician Mohammad Shahabuddin in the region, who was supported by local feudal elements. The Party has been served in the region by the influential local leaders such Ramesh Singh Kushwaha.

== Publications ==
The English-language publication of the party is &quot;Liberation&quot;, and thus the party is called CPIML Liberation. Apart from &quot;Liberation&quot;, the party publishes a central Hindi weekly organ, &quot;Samkaleen Lokyuddh&quot;. Some state party committees publish their own organs, like the weekly &quot;Ajker Deshabrati&quot; in West Bengal, &quot;Nabasphulinga&quot; in Tripura, &quot;Teeppori&quot; in Tamil Nadu, &quot;Telugu Liberation&quot; in Andhra Pradesh, &quot;Kannada Liberation&quot; in Karnataka, &quot;Samkali Lok Morcha&quot; in Punjab, etc.

== States ==
=== Bihar ===
The party has a longstanding conflict with the feudal landlords since the beginning of CPI (ML). Siwan, Bhojpur, Arrah are the strongholds of CPI (ML) movement. The communist movement in Bihar was founded by the comrade Jagdish Mahto, Rameshwar Ahir and Ramnaresh Ram in the Ekwaari village of Bhojpur. Traditionally, CPIML had a strong base between Kushwahas and Dalits of Bihar.

<doc id="845976" wikidata="Q7248594" url="?curid=845976" title="Progress of the State">
<text>Progress of the State is the title of a group of sculptural figures that sits above the south portico, at the main entrance to the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul, the state capital of the U.S. state of Minnesota.

The allegorical statuary group representing civilization is in an arrangement known as a &quot;quadriga&quot;, consisting of a chariot pulled by four horses. Three human figures, two women and a man, are included. The sculpture, made by Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter, was based on their earlier Columbus Quadriga statuary, at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. It was completed and raised to the roof of the capitol in 1906. The underlying armature is steel covered in copper. The exterior copper surface is gilded in 23 karat gold leaf and requires re-gilding approximately every 20 years.

==Design==
The quadriga arrangement is a style of statue reproducing ancient Greek and Roman four-horse chariots. In the Minnesota quadriga the male charioteer holds aloft a variation of a Roman Legion standard inscribed with the state name .

In his design for the Capitol, architect Cass Gilbert left out the classical triangular pediment favored in the Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts government architecture of the time and instead in its place installed a quadriga monument at the base of the dome. The quadriga is unusual in that it sits atop a building&#x27;s portico, rather than upon a triumphal arch like most others. The inspiration for the Minnesota quadriga was the Columbus Quadriga, a statue depicting Christopher Columbus standing in a four horse chariot guided by two maidens carrying staffs of victory that Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter had modeled for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. Potter was a specialist in equestrian and other animal sculptures who teamed up with French to create the four horses in the monument. Gilbert saw this quadriga group at and made plans to have artists adapt it for Minnesota.

The Board had two options for how French could render the group. By French&#x27;s estimates in 1896 he could cast it in bronze for $49,500 or make it from hammered copper for $36,000. The 1903 state appropriation set aside $35,000 for the group &quot;to be executed in copper.&quot; French continued to hope to cast the Quadriga in bronze, as late as spring of 1906, but Gilbert communicated the Board&#x27;s refusal: &quot;However much they would like to use bronze they have not the money available for this purpose, as their appropriation is now all engaged in finishing up various minor items which are regarded as essential.&quot; The statuary was then executed in hammered copper surrounding a framework of steel supports. 

While the statuary was generally well received, there was push back from veteran groups, politicians and the Minnesota Historical Society over the use of allegorical figures throughout the Capitol instead of representations of Minnesota heroes and historic events. One critic encouraged Minnesotans to, &quot;Take a sledge hammer and smash them Roman bronchos and that chariot! Clean &#x27;em out and put a grand heroic statue of Alexander Ramsey in their stead!&quot;

==Symbolism==
The Progress of the State was devised as an allegorical statuary where a prosperous Minnesota proceeds onward by means of the power of nature (horses) and civilization (the women). The four horses in the Minnesota quadriga represent the classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water. Independently, the women represent industry and agriculture. Collectively, they represent civilization. In addition to personifying the state of Minnesota, the male charioteer holding a cornucopia (horn of plenty), a symbol of abundance and nourishment, represents prosperity.

French&#x27;s letter on adapting his earlier quadriga from the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition to Minnesota quadriga demonstrates the casualness with which allegorical meaning could be ascribed to a statue, and vice versa.

&quot;You will be glad to know that I have begun a model for the central figure (in the chariot) of the Quadriga. The other figures are already designed, as are the horses, since we are to follow the Quadriga which presided over the Columbian Arch at Chicago... The central figure, representing Columbus would, of course, not be appropriate for the State Capitol of Minnesota, so that a new design for this figure is necessary.

As the two figures leading the horses are female figures, I think the figure in the chariot should be a male figure,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I think it should represent &quot;Minnesota&#x27;, if you think that a male figure can personify a state.&quot;&quot; 

==Restorations==
Re-gilding the sculpture in 23 karat gold leaf is necessary approximately every 20 years. Every year, the condition of the statuary is reviewed with conservators making slight repairs and touching up the gold leaf as necessary. The sculpture group underwent re-gilding in 1949 and again in 1979. In 1994 the group was taken down from the capitol roof for a year-long restoration procedure. The quadriga was reinstalled in 1995 and the figures have had several minor &quot;in situ&quot; reapplications of gold leaf since. During a comprehensive restoration of the State Capitol building the figure of the charioteer was removed and lowered to the ground in 2014 to allow repairs to corrosion of the top surface of the chariot and was reinstalled in 2015. On May 7, 2016, the Quadriga was again removed from the roof in order to allow for roofing repairs below. During that time the statuary was relocated to nearby warehouse where it was re-gilded. On November 12, 2016 the Quadriga was re-installed on the Minnesota State Capitol roof.

<text>The Republic of Canada was a government proclaimed by William Lyon Mackenzie on December 5, 1837. The self-proclaimed government was established on Navy Island in the Niagara River in the latter days of the Upper Canada Rebellion.

==History==
In the latter days of the Rebellions of 1837 in Upper Canada, after Mackenzie and 200 of his followers retreated from Toronto to Navy Island, he declared a separate republic. He established an independent currency, and supplied his camp using the American supply steamer &quot;Caroline&quot;. He recruited followers by promising of land to any man that supported his cause. He later included in his promise $100 in silver to his supporters, payable on May 1, 1838.

On December 29, Royal Navy Commander Andrew Drew and seven boatloads of Canadian militiamen crossed the Niagara River to Fort Schlosser. They captured the &quot;Caroline&quot; used by William Lyon Mackenzie and his rebels on Navy Island. Drew&#x27;s forces set the ship alight and sent it adrift towards Niagara Falls, resulting in the death of one American. It was falsely reported that dozens of Americans were killed as they were trapped on board, and U.S. soldiers retaliated by burning a British steamer while it was in U.S. waters, triggering what became known as the &quot;Caroline&quot; affair.

On January 13, 1838, Mackenzie abandoned Navy Island under heavy fire from British troops. He and his force retreated to Buffalo, New York, where they were captured by the U.S. army and sentenced in the U.S. to 18 months&#x27; imprisonment for violating neutrality laws between the United States and the United Kingdom, ending the prospect of a Canadian declaration of independence/secession and ending what the British authorities described as an inconsequential and unsupported colonial rebellion.

Some of the supporters retreated to the Thousand Islands, and &quot;caused Canadian authorities much anxiety&quot; in mid-1838. In the United States, Hunters&#x27; Lodges were established along the frontier border, some also operating in Upper Canada. The organization of these societies was headquartered in Cleveland, and its principal mission was to &quot;emancipate the British Colonies from British Thraldom&quot;. On 16 September 1838, a convention attended by 160 delegates of the organization was held in Cleveland, during which it elected Abram D. Smith the first president of the Republic of Canada. The organization also defined plans for a Republican Bank of Canada, which would use gold, silver, and its own currency as money, and pledged &quot;the whole wealth, revenue, and resources&quot; of Upper Canada as collateral for loans. Its first banknotes were to feature Samuel Lount, Peter Matthews, and James Morreau, all of whom were executed for their part in the rebellion.

<text>Y Llethr is the highest mountain in the Rhinogydd range of Snowdonia, in north Wales. The summit consists of a flat grassy top marked only by a small cairn. The summit is more in keeping with its southern flanks than its rugged northern approach.

The shortest route to the summit goes from the valley of Cwm Nantcol in the west, either directly or via Bwlch Drws Ardudwy and over the mountain of Rhinog Fach. To the south lies the mountain of Diffwys, to the south-east lies the mountain of Y Garn, to the north lies Rhinog Fach and to the west lies the hill of Moelfre.

<doc id="846000" wikidata="Q1334780" url="?curid=846000" title="Environmental degradation">
<text>Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as quality of air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution. It is defined as any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or undesirable. The environmental degradation process amplifies the impact of environmental issues which leave lasting impacts on the environment.

Environmental degradation is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change of the United Nations. The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines environmental degradation as &quot;the reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives, and needs&quot;.

Environmental degradation comes in many types. When natural habitats are destroyed or natural resources are depleted, the environment is degraded; direct environmental degradation, such as deforestation, which is readily visible; this can be caused by more indirect process, such as the build up of plastic pollution over time or the buildup of greenhouse gases that causes tipping points in the climate system. Efforts to counteract this problem include environmental protection and environmental resources management. Mismanagement that leads to degradation can also lead to environmental conflict where communities organize in opposition to the forces that mismanaged the environment.

== Biodiversity loss ==
Scientists assert that human activity has pushed the earth into a sixth mass extinction event. The loss of biodiversity has been attributed in particular to human overpopulation, continued human population growth and overconsumption of natural resources by the world&#x27;s wealthy. A 2020 report by the World Wildlife Fund found that human activity – specifically overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming – has destroyed 68% of vertebrate wildlife since 1970. The &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot;, published by the United Nation&#x27;s IPBES in 2019, posits that roughly one million species of plants and animals face extinction from anthropogenic causes, such as expanding human land use for industrial agriculture and livestock rearing, along with overfishing.

Since the establishment of agriculture over 11,000 years ago, humans have altered roughly 70% of the Earth&#x27;s land surface, with the global biomass of vegetation being reduced by half, and terrestrial animal communities seeing a decline in biodiversity greater than 20% on average. A 2021 study says that just 3% of the planet&#x27;s terrestrial surface is ecologically and faunally intact, meaning areas with healthy populations of native animal species and little to no human footprint. Many of these intact ecosystems were in areas inhabited by indigenous peoples. With 3.2 billion people affected globally, degradation affects over 30% of the world&#x27;s land area and 40% of land in developing countries.

The implications of these losses for human livelihoods and wellbeing have raised serious concerns. With regard to the agriculture sector for example, &quot;The State of the World&#x27;s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture&quot;, published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2019, states that &quot;countries report that many species that contribute to vital ecosystem services, including pollinators, the natural enemies of pests, soil organisms and wild food species, are in decline as a consequence of the destruction and degradation of habitats, overexploitation, pollution and other threats&quot; and that &quot;key ecosystems that deliver numerous services essential to food and agriculture, including supply of freshwater, protection against hazards and provision of habitat for species such as fish and pollinators, are declining.&quot;

=== Impacts of environmental degradation on women&#x27;s livelihoods ===
On the way biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation impact livelihoods, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations finds also that in contexts of degraded lands and ecosystems in rural areas, both girls and women bear heavier workloads.

Women&#x27;s livelihoods, health, food and nutrition security, access to water and energy, and coping abilities are all disproportionately affected by environmental degradation. Environmental pressures and shocks, particularly in rural areas, force women to deal with the aftermath, greatly increasing their load of unpaid care work. Also, as limited natural resources grow even scarcer due to climate change, women and girls must also walk further to collect food, water or firewood, which heightens their risk of being subjected to gender-based violence.

This implies, for example, longer journeys to get primary necessities and greater exposure to the risks of human trafficking, rape, and sexual violence.

== Water degradation ==
One major component of environmental degradation is the depletion of the resource of fresh water on Earth. Approximately only 2.5% of all of the water on Earth is fresh water, with the rest being salt water. 69% of fresh water is frozen in ice caps located on Antarctica and Greenland, so only 30% of the 2.5% of fresh water 
is available for consumption. Fresh water is an exceptionally important resource, since life on Earth is ultimately dependent on it. Water transports nutrients, minerals and chemicals within the biosphere to all forms of life, sustains both plants and animals, and moulds the surface of the Earth with transportation and deposition of materials.

The current top three uses of fresh water account for 95% of its consumption; approximately 85% is used for irrigation of farmland, golf courses, and parks, 6% is used for domestic purposes such as indoor bathing uses and outdoor garden and lawn use, and 4% is used for industrial purposes such as processing, washing, and cooling in manufacturing centres. It is estimated that one in three people over the entire globe are already facing water shortages, almost one-fifth of the world population live in areas of physical water scarcity, and almost one quarter of the world&#x27;s population live in a developing country that lacks the necessary infrastructure to use water from available rivers and aquifers. Water scarcity is an increasing problem due to many foreseen issues in the future including population growth, increased urbanization, higher standards of living, and climate change.

Industrial and domestic sewage, pesticides, fertilizers, plankton blooms, silt, oils, chemical residues, radioactive material, and other pollutants are some of the most frequent water pollutants. These have a huge negative impact on the water and can cause degradation in various levels.

=== Climate change and temperature ===

Climate change affects the Earth&#x27;s water supply in a large number of ways. It is predicted that the mean global temperature will rise in the coming years due to a number of forces affecting the climate. The amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) will rise, and both of these will influence water resources; evaporation depends strongly on temperature and moisture availability which can ultimately affect the amount of water available to replenish groundwater supplies.

Transpiration from plants can be affected by a rise in atmospheric CO2, which can decrease their use of water, but can also raise their use of water from possible increases of leaf area. Temperature rise can reduce the snow season in the winter and increase the intensity of the melting snow leading to peak runoff of this, affecting soil moisture, flood and drought risks, and storage capacities depending on the area.

Warmer winter temperatures cause a decrease in snowpack, which can result in diminished water resources during summer. This is especially important at mid-latitudes and in mountain regions that depend on glacial runoff to replenish their river systems and groundwater supplies, making these areas increasingly vulnerable to water shortages over time; an increase in temperature will initially result in a rapid rise in water melting from glaciers in the summer, followed by a retreat in glaciers and a decrease in the melt and consequently the water supply every year as the size of these glaciers get smaller and smaller.

Thermal expansion of water and increased melting of oceanic glaciers from an increase in temperature gives way to a rise in sea level. This can affect the freshwater supply to coastal areas as well. As river mouths and deltas with higher salinity get pushed further inland, an intrusion of saltwater results in an increase of salinity in reservoirs and aquifers. Sea-level rise may also consequently be caused by a depletion of groundwater, as climate change can affect the hydrologic cycle in a number of ways. Uneven distributions of increased temperatures and increased precipitation around the globe results in water surpluses and deficits, but a global decrease in groundwater suggests a rise in sea level, even after meltwater and thermal expansion were accounted for, which can provide a positive feedback to the problems sea-level rise causes to fresh-water supply.

A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth. An increase in water temperature can also affect ecosystems greatly because of a species&#x27; sensitivity to temperature, and also by inducing changes in a body of water&#x27;s self-purification system from decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature.

=== Climate change and precipitation ===

A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of soil erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water quality is probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants. While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect, some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture. It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases.

Climate models show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation, such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics. This will ultimately cause a latitudinal variation in water distribution. The areas receiving more precipitation are also expected to receive this increase during their winter and actually become drier during their summer, creating even more of a variation of precipitation distribution. Naturally, the distribution of precipitation across the planet is very uneven, causing constant variations in water availability in respective locations.

Changes in precipitation affect the timing and magnitude of floods and droughts, shift runoff processes, and alter groundwater recharge rates. Vegetation patterns and growth rates will be directly affected by shifts in precipitation amount and distribution, which will in turn affect agriculture as well as natural ecosystems. Decreased precipitation will deprive areas of water causing water tables to fall and reservoirs of wetlands, rivers, and lakes to empty. In addition, a possible increase in evaporation and evapotranspiration will result, depending on the accompanied rise in temperature. Groundwater reserves will be depleted, and the remaining water has a greater chance of being of poor quality from saline or contaminants on the land surface.

Climate change is resulting into a very high rate of land degradation causing enhanced desertification and nutrient deficient soils. The menace of land degradation is increasing by the day and has been characterized as a major global threat. According to Global Assessment of Land Degradation and Improvement (GLADA) a quarter of land area around the globe can now be marked as degraded. Land degradation is supposed to influence lives of 1.5 billion people and 15 billion tons of fertile soil is lost every year due to anthropogenic activities and climate change.

=== Population growth ===
The human population on Earth is expanding rapidly, which together with even more rapid economic growth is the main cause of the degradation of the environment. Humanity&#x27;s appetite for resources is disrupting the environment&#x27;s natural equilibrium. Production industries are venting smoke into the atmosphere and discharging chemicals that are polluting water resources. The smoke includes detrimental gases such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide. The high levels of pollution in the atmosphere form layers that are eventually absorbed into the atmosphere. Organic compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have generated an opening in the ozone layer, which admits higher levels of ultraviolet radiation, putting the globe at risk.

The available fresh water being affected by the climate is also being stretched across an ever-increasing global population. It is estimated that almost a quarter of the global population is living in an area that is using more than 20% of their renewable water supply; water use will rise with population while the water supply is also being aggravated by decreases in streamflow and groundwater caused by climate change. Even though some areas may see an increase in freshwater supply from an uneven distribution of precipitation increase, an increased use of water supply is expected.

An increased population means increased withdrawals from the water supply for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, the largest of these being agriculture, believed to be the major non-climate driver of environmental change and water deterioration. The next 50 years will likely be the last period of rapid agricultural expansion, but the larger and wealthier population over this time will demand more agriculture.

Population increase over the last two decades, at least in the United States, has also been accompanied by a shift to an increase in urban areas from rural areas, which concentrates the demand for water into certain areas, and puts stress on the fresh water supply from industrial and human contaminants. Urbanization causes overcrowding and increasingly unsanitary living conditions, especially in developing countries, which in turn exposes an increasingly number of people to disease. About 79% of the world&#x27;s population is in developing countries, which lack access to sanitary water and sewer systems, giving rises to disease and deaths from contaminated water and increased numbers of disease-carrying insects.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture is dependent on available soil moisture, which is directly affected by climate dynamics, with precipitation being the input in this system and various processes being the output, such as evapotranspiration, surface runoff, drainage, and percolation into groundwater. Changes in climate, especially the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration predicted by climate models, will directly affect soil moisture, surface runoff, and groundwater recharge.

In areas with decreasing precipitation as predicted by the climate models, soil moisture may be substantially reduced. With this in mind, agriculture in most areas already needs irrigation, which depletes fresh water supplies both by the physical use of the water and the degradation agriculture causes to the water. Irrigation increases salt and nutrient content in areas that would not normally be affected, and damages streams and rivers from damming and removal of water. Fertilizer enters both human and livestock waste streams that eventually enter groundwater, while nitrogen, phosphorus, and other chemicals from fertilizer can acidify both soils and water.
Certain agricultural demands may increase more than others with an increasingly wealthier global population, and meat is one commodity expected to double global food demand by 2050, which directly affects the global supply of fresh water. Cows need water to drink, more if the temperature is high and humidity is low, and more if the production system the cow is in is extensive, since finding food takes more effort. Water is needed in the processing of the meat, and also in the production of feed for the livestock. Manure can contaminate bodies of freshwater, and slaughterhouses, depending on how well they are managed, contribute waste such as blood, fat, hair, and other bodily contents to supplies of fresh water.

The transfer of water from agricultural to urban and suburban use raises concerns about agricultural sustainability, rural socioeconomic decline, food security, an increased carbon footprint from imported food, and decreased foreign trade balance. The depletion of fresh water, as applied to more specific and populated areas, increases fresh water scarcity among the population and also makes populations susceptible to economic, social, and political conflict in a number of ways; rising sea levels forces migration from coastal areas to other areas farther inland, pushing populations closer together breaching borders and other geographical patterns, and agricultural surpluses and deficits from the availability of water induce trade problems and economies of certain areas. Climate change is an important cause of involuntary migration and forced displacement According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, global greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture exceeds that of transportation.

=== Water management ===
Water management is the process of planning, developing, and managing water resources across all water applications, in terms of both quantity and quality.&quot; Water management is supported and guided by institutions, infrastructure, incentives, and information systems

 The issue of the depletion of fresh water has stimulated increased efforts in water management. While water management systems are often flexible, adaptation to new hydrologic conditions may be very costly. Preventative approaches are necessary to avoid high costs of inefficiency and the need for rehabilitation of water supplies, and innovations to decrease overall demand may be important in planning water sustainability.

Water supply systems, as they exist now, were based on the assumptions of the current climate, and built to accommodate existing river flows and flood frequencies. Reservoirs are operated based on past hydrologic records, and irrigation systems on historical temperature, water availability, and crop water requirements; these may not be a reliable guide to the future. Re-examining engineering designs, operations, optimizations, and planning, as well as re-evaluating legal, technical, and economic approaches to manage water resources are very important for the future of water management in response to water degradation. Another approach is water privatization; despite its economic and cultural effects, service quality and overall quality of the water can be more easily controlled and distributed. Rationality and sustainability is appropriate, and requires limits to overexploitation and pollution and efforts in conservation.

== Consumption increases ==
As the world&#x27;s population increases, it is accompanied by an increase in population demand for natural resources. With the need for more production increases comes more damage to the environments and ecosystems in which those resources are housed. According to United Nations&#x27; population growth predictions, there could be up to 170 million more births by 2070. The need for more fuel, energy, food, buildings, and water sources grows with the number of people on the planet.

However, the scale of environmental degradation is not only determined by population growth but also by consumption patterns and resource efficiency. Industrialized nations, with higher per capita consumption rates, often have a disproportionately large environmental footprint compared to less developed regions. Efforts to adopt sustainable development practices, including renewable energy, recycling, and waste reduction, could mitigate some of the environmental impacts of increased consumption. Furthermore, promoting circular economies and transitioning to low-impact technologies are critical.

=== Deforestation ===
As the need for new agricultural areas and road construction increases, the deforestation processes stay in effect. Deforestation is the &quot;removal of forest or stand of trees from land that is converted to non-forest use.&quot; (Wikipedia-Deforestation). Since the 1960s, nearly 50% of tropical forests have been destroyed, but this process is not limited to tropical forest areas. Europe&#x27;s forests are also destroyed by livestock, insects, diseases, invasive species, and other human activities. Many of the world&#x27;s terrestrial biodiversity can be found living in the different types of forests. Tearing down these areas for increased consumption directly decreases the world&#x27;s biodiversity of plant and animal species native to those areas.

Along with destroying habitats and ecosystems, decreasing the world&#x27;s forest contributes to the amount of in the atmosphere. By taking away forested areas, we are limiting the amount of carbon reservoirs, limiting it to the largest ones: the atmosphere and oceans. While one of the biggest reasons for deforestation is agriculture use for the world&#x27;s food supply, removing trees from landscapes also increases erosion rates in areas, making it harder to produce crops in those soil types.

<text>The Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), founded in 1921, was a major professional ice hockey league originally based in the prairies of Canada. It was renamed the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1925 and disbanded in 1926.

The WCHL&#x27;s Victoria Cougars were the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup when they won the 1925 Stanley Cup Finals over the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens.

==History==
===Background===
The Stanley Cup was donated in 1893 to serve as a trophy to be awarded to the national champion of Canadian amateur ice hockey. The trophy eventually became open to professional teams in 1906 and a new trophy, the Allan Cup was donated to serve as the national amateur trophy. By this time, the Canadian Prairies were being rapidly settled and in 1914 a team based in Saskatchewan (the Regina Victorias) would capture the Allan Cup for the first time. By this time, competition for the Stanley Cup, had evolved into a World Series-inspired &quot;East vs. West&quot; affair to be contested between the winners of the two professional hockey leagues then in business, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), based in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon and the National Hockey Association (NHA), based in Ontario and Quebec. Although the PCHA won two of the first three Stanley Cup series contested under this format, the National Hockey League (NHL) came to dominate Stanley Cup play after it replaced the NHA as the premier Eastern competition in 1917.

===Early years===

In 1921, the Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Tigers of the Big Four League saw their league collapse on allegations of pay for amateurs. Together with the Regina Capitals and Saskatoon Sheiks the teams organized the openly professional Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The league was organized under the presidency of E. L. &quot;Ernie&quot; Richardson of Calgary, with Wesley Champ of Regina, Robert Pinder of Saskatoon, K. C. &quot;Kenny&quot; MacKenzie of Edmonton, and J. Lloyd Turner of Calgary, becoming the directors. The league, like the National Hockey League (NHL), played six-man hockey, without the old rover position. At the time, there was not yet a clear distinction between &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; professional leagues in any North American sport other than baseball and the new league was recognized as a comparable league to the existing Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). The winner of a series between the champions of the two leagues would go on to face the winner of the NHL for the coveted Stanley Cup.

The league started with high hopes in a general climate of optimism that followed the end of the First World War. Like another then-fledgling professional league in a different sport (the American Professional Football Association, forerunners to today&#x27;s National Football League) the WCHL was centered in smaller cities with populations of under 100,000 people. In an era where professional sport was considered to be a seasonal occupation to be supplemented by off-season work, salaries even at the major professional level were relatively small and thought to be within the means of clubs in markets as small as Saskatoon and Moose Jaw.

The WCHL&#x27;s first season, 1921–22, saw the Saskatoon Sheiks have money problems and relocate to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, to become the Moose Jaw Sheiks. The Edmonton Eskimos won the regular season standings, but were upset in the playoffs by the second place Regina Capitals. The Capitals then faced the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA to determine who would go on to face the Toronto St. Patricks of the NHL for the Stanley Cup. Vancouver won the series against Regina, but lost to Toronto in the Stanley Cup finals.

In the next season, the Moose Jaw team folded, but the WCHL returned to Saskatoon with a new franchise, the Saskatoon Crescents, led by Newsy Lalonde. The WCHL and PCHA started playing inter-league games, but kept separate standings. The Edmonton Eskimos won the regular season, but lost to the NHL&#x27;s Ottawa Senators in the Stanley Cup finals.

In the 1923–24 WCHL season, the Calgary Tigers finished in first place while Edmonton finished at the bottom of the standings. The playoffs were changed this year, too, despite a protest from the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL. Instead of the two western leagues playing off to see who would play the NHL champion for the Stanley Cup, the president of the PCHA, Frank Patrick, insisted that the NHL champion had to play the PCHA winner first. This change ended up not making any difference for Montreal, as the team swept Vancouver and then Calgary for the Stanley Cup.

For the 1924–25 WCHL season, the PCHA folded and two of its teams, the Vancouver Maroons and Victoria Cougars joined the WCHL, giving the league six teams. The Saskatoon franchise became the Saskatoon Sheiks. The league had some top-level talent on its rosters, with stars such as Bun Cook and Bill Cook and rookie Eddie Shore. The Victoria Cougars, coached and managed by PCHA founder Lester Patrick, won the league championship and went on to face the Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup. Victoria easily beat the Canadiens three games to one, out scoring them 16 to 8. This would be the shining moment for the WCHL as Victoria became the first non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup since the formation of the NHL in 1917. Since then, no non-NHL team has won the Cup. In fact, the next season, 1925–26, would be the last time a team from outside the NHL would even challenge for it.

===Collapse===

The WCHL was never particularly stable. A major factor weakening the league&#x27;s long term prospects for success was the lack of any teams in Winnipeg, then by far the largest city in the Prairies. Due to the city&#x27;s relatively large size, the league hoped to ice multiple teams in the Manitoban capital (similar to how Montreal, then the largest city in Canada, hosted both the Canadiens and Maroons in the NHL). The rationale was both a desire to boost the total number of teams and a fear that a single Winnipeg team would dominate the league. However, no potential ownership group was willing to ice a team in Winnipeg without being granted the sort of territorial exclusivity that was by then common practice in North American professional sports leagues.

The beginning of the end came in 1924 when the NHL first expanded into the United States. With the NHL rapidly expanding, salaries were on the rise and the WCHL was finding it difficult to keep its star players. In 1925, the Regina Capitals relocated to Portland, Oregon, and rekindled the old name of Portland Rosebuds, which had been out of use since 1918. With the move into the U.S. came a name change for the WCHL - &quot;Canada&quot; was dropped and the league was renamed the Western Hockey League (WHL). In the eastern half of the continent, the NHL eventually achieved relative stability through large-scale expansion to the U.S. and the NHL achieved prosperity by abandoning most of its smaller cities in favour of large markets. Such a path to success was not a viable option for the WHL because few U.S. cities west of the Mississippi River had large arenas with ice plants in the 1920s. For example, St. Louis did not have such a facility until an ice plant was installed in the St. Louis Arena in 1931.

The Edmonton Eskimos won the regular season for the third time in five seasons, but it was the Victoria Cougars who won the league championship and moved on to play for the Stanley Cup. Expectations were high for the defending Stanley Cup champions, but Montreal&#x27;s other NHL team, the Montreal Maroons, were too strong for Victoria handily beating them three games to one and out scoring them 10 to 3.

By the 1925–26 season, WHL teams were openly selling players to their richer NHL rivals to stay afloat. Nevertheless, financial problems were too great to overcome, the NHL board of governors intervened by purchasing the contracts of every player in the WHL for $258,000 and the league formally disbanded. While the remnants of five former WHL teams immediately formed the professional Prairie Hockey League, the western teams had been stripped of their best players while the NHL and the Stanley Cup&#x27;s trustees regarded the PrHL as a new minor league and not a continuation of the major professional WHL. The new league would contract to just three Saskatchewan-based teams by 1927 and disappear altogether in 1928.

Although rival leagues were not formally barred from challenging for the Cup until 1947, the WHL&#x27;s collapse left the NHL as the only top-level professional league in North America. In the meantime, the Cup trustees refused to accept challenges from any rival league. In what was the most significant expansion of its early era, the NHL added three teams for its 1926–27 season, all of which survived the Great Depression to form half of the so-called Original Six in later years. Separate deals were made in stocking the new teams. The rights to the Victoria Cougars&#x27; players were bought by the Detroit franchise (which would eventually become the Detroit Red Wings) causing the team to be named the Detroit Cougars in their honor, and the Portland Rosebuds&#x27; players&#x27; rights were purchased by Frederic McLaughlin for his new Black Hawks team. The New York Rangers did not come to any similar agreement with any team but they grabbed players from certain teams like the Saskatoon Sheiks with the Cook brothers, but never less, the Rangers were the most well rounded team of the three in its early years, including winning a Stanley Cup title in 1928, their second season. Other players of the Saskatoon, Calgary, Edmonton, and Moose Jaw teams went to the already established teams like Eddie Shore going to the Boston Bruins who achieved success in 1929, winning the Stanley Cup that year. Its legacy still lives on with many players from that league being enshrined into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

<text>Ingrid Mattson (born August 24, 1963) is a Canadian activist and scholar. A professor of Islamic studies, she is currently the London and Windsor Community Chair in Islamic Studies at Huron University College at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada. Mattson is a former president of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and was described as &quot;Perhaps the most noticed figure among American Muslim women&quot; in a 2010 New York Times article.

==Early life and background==
Ingrid Mattson, the sixth of seven children, was born in 1963 in Kingston, Ontario, where she spent her childhood and attended Catholic schools. She credits the Catholic women who educated her with providing &quot;a fantastic education&quot; and &quot;a place to explore and develop this early, youthful spirituality&quot;. She studied Philosophy and Fine Arts at the University of Waterloo in Canada from 1982–87. As part of her course of study, she spent summer of 1986 as a visiting student in Paris, France. During this time, she befriended West African students from a Sufi Muslim community. On reading the Qur&#x27;an, she found, &quot;an awareness of God, for the first time since I was very young.&quot; After returning to Waterloo, she converted to Islam in 1987. She completed her studies in Waterloo and earned combined Bachelor of Arts degrees in Philosophy and Fine Arts in 1987.

==Advanced education and career==

Ingrid Mattson received a PhD in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from the University of Chicago in 1999. She then served as a Professor of Islamic Studies and Christian-Muslim Relations from 1998–2012 at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut. During that period, she founded the first accredited graduate program for Muslim chaplains in America. For a number of years she was also the Director of the MacDonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations at Hartford Seminary.

While serving as the vice-president and president of the Islamic Society of North America, Mattson worked on a number of occasions with United States government officials. She provided consultation during the administrations of US Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. This work focused on policies regarding violent extremism, Muslim-American military service, and protection of civil rights for Muslim-Americans. John O. Brennan, the Director of the CIA, when he was Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and Assistant to President Obama thanked Mattson for her leadership at a public meeting at New York University.

Her work focuses on fostering positive relationships between groups of differing religious faiths. She is an advocate for interfaith engagement and multi-faith activism in the interest of the public good. She has spent her academic career teaching Islamic Studies and interfaith relations in historically Christian institutions. As ISNA president, Mattson established a national office for interfaith relations in Washington, DC in 2006. She invited Rabbi Eric Yoffie, President of the Union for Reform Judaism, to speak at the organization&#x27;s annual convention in Chicago in 2006. Mattson spoke the next year at the group&#x27;s Biennial where she received a standing ovation and announced &quot;a new partnership that promotes interfaith dialogue and other relationship-building activities&quot; between the two organizations. She also established programs with other Jewish organizations. The &quot;Twinning Program&quot; with the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding is one such program. Another is the three year &quot;Jews and Muslims in America&quot; program developed in cooperation with the Jewish Theological Seminary and funded by the Carnegie Institute.

Mattson has advocated for greater understanding and partnerships between Muslims and Buddhists as well. She shared the stage with the Dalai Lama on a number of occasions, including the &quot;Seeds of Peace&quot; program in Seattle in 2008, in Indiana in 2010, and in Chicago in 2011.

Mattson is an original signatory of &quot;A Common Word&quot; and has participated in many Christian-Muslim conferences and dialogues with the Jordanian Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought. Her leadership in interfaith cooperation has been recognized by Burt Visotzsky of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. She was also awarded an honorary doctorate in 2012 by the Chicago Theological Seminary for her service to the faith community.

Her book, &quot;The Story of The Qur&#x27;an: its history and place in Muslim Life&quot; (now in its 2nd edition) was chosen in 2012 by the National Endowment for the Humanities for inclusion in its &quot;Bridging Cultures&quot; program.

== Views on the role of women in Islam ==
Mattson advocates for a greater public role for Muslim women as religious leaders. When she founded the first accredited graduate program for Muslim chaplains in the US, she insisted that it be open to women. Mattson wears a hijab, but argues that governments should have no authority to enforce religious dress or ban it. Mattson has worked with a Muslim social service agency called Peaceful Families. The group to advocates against domestic violence in the Muslim community and argues against interpretations of the Qur&#x27;an that permit violence to or discrimination against women.

Mattson is also the Founder and Director of The Hurma Project - an initiative to help Muslim communities prevent and act against spiritual and sexual abuse by those in position of religious authority and influence. She explained in an interview with Haute Hijab magazine that she was motivated to act after witnessing on multiple occasions how the community was not able to appropriately acknowledge and deal with such situations. She said, &quot;I realized we needed something broad and interdisciplinary to examine the scope of the problem, have a good understanding of all of the dynamics and develop educational materials and processes that we can bring to the community.&quot;

==Opposition to Islamic extremism==
Mattson has been a critic of Islamic religious extremism since she first encountered the Taliban while trying to educate Afghan refugee girls in Pakistan. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Mattson published an article on Beliefnet entitled &quot;American Muslims have a Special Obligation.&quot; In the article, she stated, &quot;I, as an American Muslim leader, denounce not only suicide bombers and the Taliban, but those leaders of other Muslim states who thwart democracy, repress women, use the Qur&#x27;an to justify un-Islamic behavior and encourage violence.&quot; Since the attacks of September 11, Mattson been interviewed many times on the radio. She has lectured publicly to denounce violence in the name of Islam and advocated for peaceful resolution of conflicts and differences. In a 2007 essay, Mattson condemned &quot;Exclusivist, triumphalist, communal identities (religious or political)&quot; that justify violent attacks on other groups. Mattson was one of the original signatories of the Amman Message that was an international Muslim response to sectarian violence and terrorism in the name of Islam.

<text>Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) is an anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninist communist party in India. After the death of Charu Majumdar in 1972 the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) pro Charu Majumdar central committee was led by Mahadev Mukherjee and Jagjit Singh Sohal, and the Central Committee took a stand to defend the line of Charu Majumdar on 5–6 December 1972.
The pro Charu Majumdar CPI (M-L) soon faced a split on the question of Lin Biao and the tenth congress of the Communist Party of China, the faction led by Jauhar, Vinod Mishra and Swadesh Bhattacharya parted way from the party by opposing the line of the Central Committee and founded the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation in 1973 which became the pro Charu Majumdar and anti Lin Biao faction. 
The pro Charu Majumdar and pro Lin Biao faction of the CPI (M-L) was led by Mahadev Mukherjee and this faction organized massive armed assaults on government and rich peasantry in West Bengal, However, their attempt of reviving the revolutionary terrorist line of Charu Majumdar did not last long due to police repression. The pro Lin Biao faction led by
Mahadev Mukherjee held the 2nd Congress of the CPI (M-L) in December 1973 in Kamalpur, Burdwan district of West Bengal and soon Kamalpur became a centre of armed guerrilla activity. The armed clashes between government and CPI (M-L) supporter guerrillas in Kamalpur led to a division in the Central Committee with one section attempting to purge Mahadev and his supporters
in Deganga session of the Central Committee. The division led to the arrest of Mahadev Mukherjee from Shillong. Later in late 70&#x27;s the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Second Central Committee was formed by Azizul Haque and Nishit Bhattacharya after a split from the Mahadev Mukherjee led Central Committee.

Still today the CPI (M-L) Mahadev Mukherjee holds the sectarian political line of Charu Majumdar and Lin Biao.

The CPI (M-L) Mahadev Mukherjee has organizational presence in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, West Bengal, New Delhi and Tamil Nadu. The party calls for boycott of parliamentary polls, and urges for armed struggle. The party does not carry out open works and is an underground party. It holds rallies and mass meetings in Naxalbari and Siliguri region of West Bengal only. The party organized a mass rally at Naxalbari on 25 May 2006 in the presence of Mahadev Mukherjee. In Siliguri, the party launches a one-day general strike every year in July, to commemorate the killing of Charu Majumdar.

On 28 July 2009 the CPI (M-L) Mahadev Mukherjee supporters lynched innocent DYFI leader in North Bengal while enforcing such annual strike
As per the statements in the party website after the death of Mahadev Mukherjee in 2009 the party is led by a peasant leader Manik.

<text>Monk seals are earless seals of the tribe Monachini. They are the only earless seals found in tropical climates. The two genera of monk seals, &quot;Monachus&quot; and &quot;Neomonachus&quot;, comprise three species: the Mediterranean monk seal, &quot;Monachus monachus&quot;; the Hawaiian monk seal, &quot;Neomonachus schauinslandi&quot;; and the Caribbean monk seal, &quot;Neomonachus tropicalis&quot;, which became extinct in the 20th century. The two surviving species are now rare and in imminent danger of extinction. All three monk seal species were classified in genus &quot;Monachus&quot; until 2014, when the Caribbean and Hawaiian species were placed into a new genus, &quot;Neomonachus&quot;.

Monk seals have a slender body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with nostrils on the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, but they are opportunistic. The skin is covered in small hairs, which are generally black in males and brown or dark gray in females. Monk seals are found in the Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the east Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean.

All species experienced overhunting by sealers. The Hawaiian monk seal experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were too low to hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced both commercial and illegal hunting since the Middle Ages and has always been threatened with eradication by fishermen. As of 2022, it is estimated and agreed upon that not more than 600-700 Mediterranean monk seals remain, concentrated primarily along the coasts of Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece. The Hawaiian monk seal appears to be faring somewhat better; the 2021 monk seal population count by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) numbered 1,570 animals, an encouraging increase from 1,453 seals in 2019. This marked the first time the Hawaiian monk seal&#x27;s population exceeded 1,500 in 20 years; their numbers have been recorded and observed to increase approximately 2% each year from 2013-2021. Some of this successful growth is undoubtedly due to numerous rescue-and-release operations and the relocating of weaned pups to quieter beaches (with lower numbers of predatory sharks and less human interactions), enabling more seals to mature naturally and safely.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;monk seal&quot; (German &quot;Münchs-Robbe&quot;) was suggested by naturalist Johann Hermann, who claimed that the seal was popularly known as &quot;moine&quot; (French for &quot;monk&quot;) in Marseilles, and speculated that the seal looks from behind like a monk wearing a cape and hood.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Monk seals are earless seals (true seals) of the tribe Monachini. The tribe was first conceived by Victor Blanchard Scheffer in his 1958 book &quot;Seals, Sea Lions, and Walruses: A Review of the Pinnipedia&quot;. The two genera of monk seals, &quot;Monachus&quot; and &quot;Neomonachus&quot;, comprise three species: the Mediterranean monk seal (&quot;Monachus monachus&quot;), the Hawaiian monk seal (&quot;Neomonachus schauinslandi&quot;), and the Caribbean monk seal (&quot;N. tropicalis&quot;), which became extinct in the 20th century. All three monk seal species were classified in genus &quot;Monachus&quot; until 2014, when comparison of the species&#x27; mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences led biologists to place the Caribbean and Hawaiian species in a new genus, &quot;Neomonachus&quot;.

Fossils of the Mediterranean and Caribbean species are known from the Pleistocene. The time of divergence between the Hawaiian and Caribbean species, 3.7 million years ago (Mya), corresponds to the closing of the Central American Seaway by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. The divergence between Mediterranean seals and the New World clade was dated to 6.3 Mya ago.

Fossils of a Pliocene species of monk seal, &quot;Eomonachus belegaerensis&quot;, have been found in Taranaki region of New Zealand. This could possibly place the origins of the group in the Southern Hemisphere. The only other fossil monk seal is &quot;Pliophoca etrusca&quot;, from the late Pliocene of Italy.

==Habitat==

The Hawaiian monk seal, as the name suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. Monk seals migrated to Hawaii between 4–11 Mya through an open-water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the seaway 3 Mya. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When monk seals are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian monk seals tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.

The habitat of the Mediterranean monk seal has changed over the years. Prior to the 20th century, they had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather inaccessible to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species&#x27; natural habitat. Because of these seals&#x27; shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.

Caribbean monk seals were found in warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally visited the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.

==Description==

Monk seals are part of the family Phocidae (earless seals), the members of which are characterized by their lack of external ears, the inability to rotate the hind flippers under the body, and shed their hair and the outer layer of their skin in an annual molt. Monk seals as a whole vary minutely in size, with all adults measuring on average and . They exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that male Mediterranean monk seals are slightly larger than females, while in Hawaiian monk seals, females are larger. Its white belly, gray coat, and slender physique distinguish it from the harbor seal (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;), another earless seal.

The Mediterranean monk seal has a short, broad, and flat snout, with very pronounced, long nostrils that face upwards. The flippers are relatively short, with small, slender claws. The monk seal&#x27;s physique is ideally suited for hunting its prey: fish, octopus, lobster, and squid in deep-water coral beds. The fur coats of males is generally black, and brown or dark gray in females. Pups are about long and weigh around , their skin being covered by fur, usually dark brown or black. On their bellies, a white stripe occurs, which differs in color between the two sexes. This hair is replaced after 6–8 weeks by the usual short hair adults carry.
The Hawaiian monk seal (whose Hawaiian name means &quot;the dog that runs in rough waters&quot;) has a short, broad, and flat snout, with long nostrils that face forward. It has a relatively small, flat head with large, black eyes, eight pairs of teeth, and a short snout with the nostrils on top of the snout and vibrissae on each side. The nostrils are small, vertical slits, which close when the seal dives under water. Additionally, their slender, torpedo-shaped body and hind flippers allow them to be very agile swimmers. Adult males are in weight and in length, while adult females tend to be, typically, slightly larger, at and in length. When monk seal pups are born, they weigh and are in length. As they nurse for about 6 weeks, they grow considerably, eventually weighing between by the time they are weaned, while the mother loses up to .

Caribbean monk seals had a relatively large, long, robust body, and could grow to nearly in length and weighed . Males were probably slightly larger than females, which is similar to Mediterranean monk seals. Like other monk seals, this species had a distinctive head and face. The head was rounded with an extended, broad muzzle. The face had relatively large, wide-spaced eyes, upward-opening nostrils, and fairly big whisker pads with long, light-colored, and smooth whiskers. When compared to the body, the animal&#x27;s foreflippers were relatively short with little claws and the hindflippers were slender. Their coloration was brownish and/or grayish, with the underside lighter than the dorsal area. Adults were darker than the paler and more yellowish younger seals. Caribbean monk seals were also known to have algae growing on their pelages, giving them a slightly greenish appearance, which is similar to Hawaiian monk seals.

==Behavior==

===Diet and predation===

Hawaiian monk seals mainly prey on reef-dwelling bony fish, but they also prey on cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and subadults prey more on smaller octopus species, such as &quot;Octopus leteus&quot; and &quot;O. hawaiiensis&quot; (nocturnal octopus species), and eels than do adult Hawaiian monk seals. Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as &quot;O. cyanea&quot;. Hawaiian monk seals have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity, which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed on a wide variety of available prey. Tiger sharks, great white sharks, and Galapagos sharks are all predators of the Hawaiian monk seal.

Mediterranean monk seals are diurnal and feed on a variety of fish and mollusks, primarily octopus, squid, and eels, up to per day. They are known to forage mostly at depths of , but some have been observed by NOAA submersibles at a depth of . They prefer hunting in wide-open spaces, enabling them to use their speed more effectively. They are successful bottom-feeding hunters; some have even been observed lifting slabs of rock in search of prey. They have no natural predators.

===Reproduction and development===

Very little is known of the Mediterranean monk seal&#x27;s reproduction. They are thought to be polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although no breeding season exists, since births take place year round, a peak occurs in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to wash out due to high surf or storm surge, which causes high mortality rates among pups, especially at the key Cabo Blanco colony. Pups make first contact with the water 2 weeks after their birth and are weaned around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups go off to feed for an average of 9 hours. Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at 4 years of age. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony may have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year. Mediterranean monk seals generally live to be 25 to 30 years old.

Hawaiian monk seals are polygynous. The breeding season takes place throughout the year, excluding the fall, but peaks during April and May. Shark attacks cause a high pup mortality, from 19% to 39%. Pups are thought to be weaned around 6 weeks and reach sexual maturity at 3 years. Their typical lifespan is 25 to 30 years.

Not much is known of the Caribbean monk seal&#x27;s reproduction. They likely bore a single pup every two years. Their gestation period, lactation period, and sexual maturity age are unknown.

==Interactions with humans==

===Hawaii===


====Threats====
In the 19th century, many seals were killed by whalers and sealers for meat, oil, and skin. U.S. military forces hunted them during World War II, while occupying Laysan Island and Midway Island. Human disturbances have had immense effects on the populations of the Hawaiian monk seal. They tend to avoid beaches where they are disturbed; after continual disturbance, the seals may completely abandon the beach, thus reducing habitat size, subsequently limiting population growth. For instance, large beach crowds and beach structures limit the seal&#x27;s habitat. The WWII military bases in the northwestern islands were closed, but minimal human activities can be enough to disturb the species. The current population is only around 1,400 individuals.

The Hawaiian monk seal has the lowest level of genetic variability among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species&#x27;s ability to adapt to environmental pressures and limits natural selection, thus increasing their risk of extinction. Given the monk seal&#x27;s small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.

Entanglement can result in mortality, because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets, they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals by direct and indirect relationships. Directly, the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals have one of the highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.

====Conservation====
In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), which is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an environmental impact statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the HINWR, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.

NOAA cultivated a network of volunteers to protect the seals while they bask or bear and nurse their young. NOAA is funding considerable research on seal population dynamics and health in conjunction with the Marine Mammal Center. From NOAA, several programs and networks were formed. Community programs such as PIRO have helped to improve community standards for the Hawaiian monk seal. The program also creates networks with the native Hawaiians on the island to network more people in the fight for conservation of the seals. The Marine Mammal Response Network is partnered with NOAA and several other government agencies that deal with land and marine wildlife.

To raise awareness of the species&#x27; plight, on June 11, 2008, a state law designated the Hawaiian monk seal as Hawaii&#x27;s official state mammal.

===Mediterranean===
====Threats====

Several causes provoked a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, who used to consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population is estimated to be less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals on Gyaros, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – roughly 20 individuals). Some individuals may be using coastal areas along other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species&#x27; distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, low genetic variability exists.
Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is the largest surviving single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within 2 months, extremely compromising the species&#x27; viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.

====Conservation====

In the Aegean Sea, Greece has allocated a large area for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal.

One of the largest groups among the foundations concentrating their efforts towards the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal is the Mediterranean Seal Research Group (&quot;Akdeniz Foklarını Araştırma Grubu&quot;) operating under the Underwater Research Foundation (&quot;Sualtı Araştırmaları Derneği&quot;) in Turkey (also known as SAD-AFAG). The group has taken initiative in joint preservation efforts together with the Foça municipal officials, as well as phone, fax, and email hotlines for sightings.

===Caribbean===

The extinction of the Caribbean monk seal was mainly triggered by overhunting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to obtain the oil held within their blubber, fueled by the large demand for seal products. As early as 1688, sugar plantation owners sent out hunting parties to kill hundreds of seals every night for blubber oil to lubricate machinery. The Caribbean monk seals&#x27; docile nature and lack of an instinctive fear of humans made it an easy target, and hunting only ended (in the 1850s) because the population was too low for commercial use. Overfishing of the reefs that sustained the Caribbean monk seal population also contributed to their extinction. Fish stock decline in the Caribbean starved the remaining populations. Little was done to protect the Caribbean monk seal; by the time it was placed on the endangered species list in 1967, it was likely already extinct.

<text>Ça Ira (French for &quot;It will be all right&quot;, subtitled &quot;There is Hope&quot;) is an opera by Roger Waters. It comes in three acts and is a concept album. The album is based on the French libretto co-written by Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gil on the historical subject of the early French Revolution. &quot;Ça Ira&quot; was released 26 September 2005, as a double CD album featuring baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Ying Huang, and tenor Paul Groves. The album received mixed reviews, with critics praising the composition but criticising its plot and simplicity.

==History==
Waters, known for his work in the English rock band Pink Floyd, was approached by friends Étienne Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye in 1987, and asked to set their libretto to music. The initial version was completed and recorded by the end of 1988. On hearing it, an impressed François Mitterrand urged the Paris Opera to stage it for the bicentennial of the revolution the following July. The opera directors, however, were resistant. &quot;It foundered on French chauvinism,&quot; Waters suggested. &quot;The idea of an English bass player from a pop group creating something they might use in their celebrations stuck in the Gallic craw.&quot; Starting in 1989, Waters rewrote the libretto in English.

==Critical reaction==
&quot;Ça Ira&quot; has received mixed reviews. The biggest criticisms were that the opera is too narrative, which makes staging very difficult – and, as a result, disrupts the flow of the piece. Others have complained that the score is too conventional and that Waters should have taken more risks with it.

==Performances==
The first time any part of &quot;Ça Ira&quot; was heard in public was on 16 October 2002 when the Overture was performed live at the Royal Albert Hall in London by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, during a benefit gala for the Countryside Alliance.

The next public airing (not a live performance, but a recording played through a sound system) took place in Malta on 1 May 2004, the night that Malta entered the European Union. An approximately 15-minute-long excerpt was heard by 80,000 people present at the waterfront of the Grand Harbour. The music was accompanied by a light show by Gert Hoff.

The official premiere took place in Rome on 17 November 2005, in front of a sold-out crowd, and was followed the next evening by another performance. Both shows were praised for the high quality of music, vocal performances, and sound. The choir, orchestra, and soloists were complemented by a projection screen backdrop which displayed images (some photographed by Mark Holthusen) helping to tell the story.

A full operatic performance took place on 25 August 2006 in Poznań, Poland, and was televised live on Poland&#x27;s TVP. The project involved the same number of musicians from the concert performances in addition to more than 200 dancers from the Great Theatre in Poznań. There were also period elements of stage design (such as horses, carriages and war scenes with soldiers and stunt performers) and full costumes. Over 500 artists were involved, and the production reportedly cost in excess of €2 million. Performances were held in Kyiv on 16 December, and at the Poznań Opera House on 30 and 31 December 2006.

In April 2008, the opera was performed, with the libretto in English, as part of the in Manaus, Brazil by the Amazonas Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.

===Dates===
==Recordings==

The 2005 release was available in three formats:

* A three-disc set with regular CD and Super Audio (SACD) stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound versions. Disc 3 was a DVD with a 55-minute documentary by Adrian Maben, showing Waters at work on the opera. This also included a 60-page book with libretto and credits, and illustrations by Nadine Roda-Gil. 
* A two-disc set with regular audio CDs, including libretto and illustrations in CD-ROM format. 
* A two-disc set in the original French.

&quot;I have no idea how many people it will appeal to,&quot; Waters remarked. &quot;There&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s going to appeal to people in the [same] way [as] &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. It&#x27;s a different animal. I&#x27;d like to say I don&#x27;t care, but obviously I do.&quot; In the event, the album spent 14 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Classical Chart in the United States and peaked at number 5.

<text>Barry Kay (1932 – 1985) was an Australian stage and costume designer of international renown. After having studied painting at the Académie Julian in Paris and theatre design in Melbourne, he settled in London in 1956. In the course of his career, lasting almost four decades, he designed for the ballet, opera and theatre alike, working with established directors and choreographers at major theatres and opera houses and their companies worldwide.

Kay&#x27;s emphasis lay in pioneering three-dimensional stage set designs for the ballet. By breaking away from the traditional use of &quot;flat wings&quot; scenery, in designing for the theatre he expanded on the revolutionary ideas of the Russian Constructivists and the Italian Futurists in the early part of the 20th century.

Among others, he designed for the choreographers Walter Gore, Peter Darrell, Kenneth MacMillan and Rudolf Nureyev, as well as for ballet companies such as Western Theatre Ballet (now Scottish Ballet), The Royal Ballet, The Australian Ballet, the Ballet of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Stuttgart Ballet, the Vienna State Opera Ballet, Le Ballet de l&#x27;Opéra de Paris and American Ballet Theatre.

Some of the drama and opera directors for whom he worked included Margaret Webster, Colin Graham, John Copley, Peter Dews and Rudolf Hartmann - with productions staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Old Vic, London; Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company (since 1974 English National Opera), Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, London; The Royal Opera at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London; and numerous other national and international houses.

Later in his career Kay also became a photographer of subjects with socio-anthropological contents. His photo essay &quot;As a Woman&quot;, published in 1976, is an extensive portrait of the unique transvestite and transsexual community of Sydney, Australia.

Kay&#x27;s artistic contributions to the performing arts are well represented and documented at national museums, state galleries, art libraries, theatre collections and archives globally. Public collections include: the Australian Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre Melbourne; Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Theatre Collections, London; Royal Opera House Collections, London; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; National Library of Australia, Canberra; State Library of New South Wales, Mitchell Library, Sydney; Lipperheidesche Kostümbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin; Österreichisches Theatermuseum, Vienna; University of Calgary, Library, Special Collections, Alberta, Canada; MacNay Museum, Tobin Collection of Theatre Arts, San Antonio, Texas.

In November 2006, the Barry Kay Archive website was archived by the National Library of Australia in its PANDORA web archive.

==Honours==
Live Performance Australia, the premiere body for Australia&#x27;s live entertainment and performing arts, posthumously selected Kay as one of eighty theatre artists awarded a place in its newly established virtual Hall of Fame. Launched on 30 November 2007, Live Performance pays tribute to a collection of people on the occasion of its 90th anniversary.

<text>The 1903 Tour de France was the first cycling race set up and sponsored by the newspaper &#x27;, ancestor of the current daily,&#x27;. It ran from 1 to 19 July in six stages over , and was won by Maurice Garin.

The race was invented to boost the circulation of &#x27;, after its circulation started to plummet from competition with the long-standing&#x27;. Originally scheduled to start in June, the race was postponed one month, and the prize money was increased, after a disappointing level of applications from competitors. The 1903 Tour de France was the first stage road race, and compared to modern Grand Tours, it had relatively few stages, but each was much longer than those raced today. The cyclists did not have to compete in all six stages, although this was necessary to qualify for the general classification.

The pre-race favourite, Maurice Garin, won the first stage, and retained the lead throughout. He also won the last two stages, and had a margin of almost three hours over the next cyclist. The circulation of &#x27; increased more than sixfold during and after the race, so the race was considered successful enough to be rerun in 1904, by which time&#x27; had been forced out of business.

==Origin==
After the Dreyfus affair separated advertisers from the newspaper &#x27;, a new newspaper &#x27; was founded in 1900, with former cyclist Henri Desgrange as editor. After being forced to change the name of the newspaper to &quot;&quot; in 1903, Desgrange needed something to keep the cycling fans; with circulation at 20,000, he could not afford to lose them.

When Desgrange and young employee Géo Lefèvre were returning from the Marseille–Paris cycling race, Lefèvre suggested holding a race around France, similar to the popular six-day races on the track. Desgrange proposed the idea to the financial controller Victor Goddet, who gave his approval, and on 19 January 1903, the Tour de France was announced in &quot;&quot;.

It was to have been a five-week race, from 1 June to 5 July, with an entry fee of 20 francs. These conditions attracted very few cyclists: one week before the race was due to start, only 15 competitors had signed up. Desgrange then rescheduled the race from 1 to 19 July, increased the total prize money to 20,000 francs, reduced the entry fee to 10 francs and guaranteed at least five francs a day to the first 50 cyclists in the classification. After that, 79 cyclists signed up for the race, of whom 60 actually started the race.

Géo Lefévre became the director, judge and time-keeper; Henri Desgrange was the , although he did not follow the race.

==Rules and course==
The 1903 Tour de France was run in six stages. Compared to modern stage races, the stages were extraordinarily long, with an average distance of over , compared to the average stage length in the 2004 Tour de France; cyclists had one to three rest days between each stage, and the route was largely flat, with only one stage featuring a significant mountain. The cyclists were not grouped in teams but raced as individuals, and paid a fee of ten francs (about at 2023 prices) to compete in the race for general classification, or five francs to enter a single stage. As the stages were so long, all but the first started before dawn: the last stage started at 21:00 the night before.

The first Tour de France crossed no mountain passes, but several lesser cols. The first was the col du Pin-Bouchain (), on the opening stage from Paris to Lyon, on what is now the old road from Roanne to Lyon. The stage from Lyon to Marseille included the col de la République (), also known as the col de Grand Bois, at the edge of St-Etienne.

In 1903, it was normal for a professional cyclist to hire pacers, who would lead them during the race. Desgrange forbade this: it was originally intended that in the final, longest, stage pacers would be allowed, but this was rescinded after the fifth stage.

To ensure that the cyclists rode the entire route, stewards were stationed at various points around the course. The yellow jersey for the leader in the general classification had not yet been introduced, but the leader was identified by a green armband.

The fastest eight cyclists on each stage received a prize between 50 francs and 1,500 francs, varying per stage. The fourteen best cyclists in the general classification received a prize from 3,000 francs for the winner to 25 francs for fourteenth place. The remaining seven cyclists to finish in the general classification each received 95 francs, 5 francs for each of the 19 days that the race took, provided that they had not won more than 200 francs in prize money and did not have an average speed below on any stage.

==Participants==
In contrast to modern stage races, a cyclist who gave up during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although he would no longer be in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won the second and third stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed the third stage.

Sixty cyclists, all professionals or semi-professionals, started the race, of whom 49 were French, 4 Belgian, 4 Swiss, 2 German, and one Italian; 21 of them were sponsored by bicycle manufacturers, while 39 entered without commercial support. 24 other cyclists took advantage of the opportunity to enter specific stages: one rode in both the second and fourth stages, and additionally three cyclists took part in the second stage, one in the third stage, fifteen in the fourth stage only, and a further four only competed in the fifth stage.

==Race overview==

The pre-race favourites for the victory were Maurice Garin and Hippolyte Aucouturier. Garin dominated the race from the start by winning the first stage, a parcours from Paris to Lyon. The stage started at 15:16, and the cyclists initially rode with a speed of 35 km/h. The first cyclists abandoned after around . At 23:00, Garin and Emile Pagie, leading the race, reached the control point in Nevers. Garin expected at that point that they would finish at 8:00 the next morning. During the night, Garin&#x27;s main rival, Aucouturier, had stomach cramps, and was unable to finish the stage. Also during that first stage, the first breach of the rules occurred: Jean Fischer had used a car as pacer, which was illegal. Pagie fell down, but got up again; he and Garin kept leading the race during the night. Around 9:00 in the morning, both reached Lyon. Garin got away from Pagie, and finished one minute ahead.
Although Aucouturier had abandoned in the first stage, and so was not eligible for the general classification, he could still start the rest of the stages. In the second stage, Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second stage, which eliminated him from the race.
In the fourth stage, Aucouturier had a clear lead and seemed set to win a third successive stage, but was caught using the slipstream of a car, and was removed from the race. Swiss Charles Laeser (who had abandoned in the 3rd stage) took the victory, becoming the first non-French winner. As in the third stage, the cyclists departed in two groups, and Laeser was in the second group because he was no longer contending for the general classification. Laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a group of six cyclists, but he had travelled the distance 4 minutes faster than them, so he was declared the winner.

At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget almost two hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, and fell asleep when he stopped at the side of the road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin extended his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours&#x27; advantage into the final day&#x27;s racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau&#x27;s rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometre of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.

The last stage was the longest, at , and ran from Nantes to the small town of Ville-d&#x27;Avray, which lies between Versailles and Paris, instead of at the Parc des Princes velodrome. This was because of a bylaw forbidding road races to end on cycling tracks (a bylaw subsequently repealed in light of the race&#x27;s success). Garin took his third stage win, and sealed overall victory by 2 hours 59 minutes 31 seconds: this remains the greatest margin of victory in the Tour de France. After arriving at Ville-d&#x27;Avray the riders were given a board marked with their finishing time and cycled on to Parc des Princes where they made several laps of honour. That day, 19 July, saw a large crowd at the velodrome to watch the riders and an earlier 100-km cycle race.

==Results==

===Stage results===

In 1903, there was no distinction in the rules between plain stages and mountain stages; the icons shown here indicate whether the stage included mountains.

===General classification===

There were 21 cyclists who had completed all six stages. For these cyclists, the times taken for each stage were added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the winner. The cyclists officially were not grouped in teams; some cyclists had the same sponsor, even though they were not allowed to work together,


==Aftermath==

The circulation of &quot;&quot; increased significantly due to this event; a special edition of 130,000 copies was made after the race was over, and normal circulation increased from 25,000 to 65,000. The big success made sure that the Tour de France was scheduled again for 1904.
The cyclists had also become national heroes. Maurice Garin returned for the 1904 Tour de France but his title defence failed when he was disqualified. With the prize money that he won in 1903, which totalled 6,075 francs, (approximately 40,000 and GBP£23,000 in 2006 values) Garin later bought a gas station, where he worked for the rest of his life.

<text>The Mersey River is a river on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Australia. The city of Devonport is situated at the river&#x27;s mouth on Bass Strait.

==Geography==
The Mersey River originates in Lake Meston, located within the Walls of Jerusalem National Park in Tasmania’s Central Highlands. The river descends through a series of alpine lakes, including Lake Youd, Lake Rowallan, and Lake Parangana, before reaching the Bass Strait at Devonport. The river’s course is characterised by its passage through glaciated landscapes, including U-shaped valleys and moraines formed during the Pleistocene epoch.

Key tributaries of the Mersey River include Lees Creek, Feather Creek, Campfire Creek, Overflow Creek, and Mole Creek. The river’s flow is also supplemented by water from the Fisher River and its tributaries. Several smaller creeks, such as Lobster Rivulet and the Dasher River, join the Mersey downstream.

==Hydroelectric System==
The Mersey River is a vital component of Tasmania’s hydroelectric power system. The Rowallan Power Station at Lake Rowallan and the Parangana Power Station at Lake Parangana generate electricity, with water diverted westward to the Lemonthyme Power Station on the Forth River. A portion of the river’s flow continues downstream to support environmental and recreational needs.

==History==
The Mersey River was significant to the Panninher people, who relied on its resources for sustenance and cultural practices. Following European settlement in the early 19th century, the river became a hub for timber milling and agriculture. Later, mining activities in the surrounding areas further contributed to the region’s economic development.

The river gained attention in 2016 when severe flooding caused significant damage to infrastructure, including bridges and riverbanks, and created logjams in narrow sections. These events highlighted the challenges of managing extreme weather impacts on the Mersey River system.

==Ecology==
The Mersey River supports diverse ecosystems, including habitats for platypuses, trout, and native fish species. It is also home to the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (&quot;Astacopsis gouldi&quot;), the world&#x27;s largest freshwater invertebrate, which inhabits the river and its tributaries. Conservation efforts aim to protect this vulnerable species from habitat disturbance and illegal fishing.

The river&#x27;s health is monitored by the Environment Protection Authority, which assesses water quality and ecosystem conditions. Reports focus on protecting aquatic ecosystems and managing environmental challenges, such as agricultural runoff and invasive species.

Annual reports from the Department of Natural Resources and Environment provide data on streamflow, water allocation, and river health, contributing to sustainable management of the Mersey River.

The upper reaches of the Mersey, within the Walls of Jerusalem National Park, are home to unique alpine flora and fauna. Conservation initiatives aim to preserve these environments while balancing the needs of tourism and hydroelectric development.

==Recreation==

The Mersey River is renowned for trout fishing, offering opportunities to catch brown and rainbow trout. 

Recreational activities along the river include whitewater rafting, kayaking, and water skiing. The river hosts events such as the annual Devonport Regatta, which features boat racing, swimming, and woodchopping competitions. The Henley-on-Mersey festival in Latrobe celebrates Australia Day with unique activities like ferret racing, cherry spitting, and gumboot throwing.

<text>Zachariah Davis Wheat (May 23, 1888 – March 11, 1972), nicknamed &quot;Buck&quot;, was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a left fielder from 1909 to 1927, most notably as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers who were known as the Robins at that time. After 18 seasons in Brooklyn, he played his final season with the Philadelphia Athletics.

Although Wheat spent the first part of his career playing in the Dead ball era, he hit over .300 in 13 seasons and won the National League batting championship in 1918. He ended his career with a .317 career batting average and remains the Dodgers all-time franchise leader in games, at bats, plate appearances, hits, doubles, triples, and total bases. Wheat was also known as a stylish and graceful outfielder, leading National League left fielders in putouts seven times and fielding percentage twice.

Wheat was unanimously elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1959. His brother McKinley &quot;Mack&quot; Wheat also played in the major leagues, and the two were teammates in Brooklyn for five seasons.

==Early life==
Born in Hamilton, Missouri, he was the son of Basil and Julia Wheat. His father was of English descent. For many years, it was believed that Wheat was at least partially of Cherokee descent but, according to the Society for American Baseball Research, this was likely untrue.

==Career==
Wheat began his professional baseball career in 1906 for Enterprise in the Kansas League, followed by Wichita in 1907, the Shreveport Pirates of the Texas League in 1908, and the Mobile Sea Gulls of the Southern Association in 1909. It was during that 1909 season that the Brooklyn Superbas of the National League purchased Wheat for $1,200, and he made his major league debut in September. Wheat batted with a corkscrew type of swing, and held his hands down near the end of the bat, unlike most hitters during his time, a time noted as the &quot;Dead Ball Era&quot;. Along with his consistently high levels of hitting, he was also noted for his graceful and stylish defense.

Wheat played his first full season in 1910. He played every game for the Superbas that season as the regular left fielder, leading the league in games played. He batted .284 that season, the second-lowest average of his career, which led the team, and was among the league leaders in hits, doubles, and triples. It was in 1911 that his reputation as a slugger began to take hold. Along with hitting .287, Wheat finished eighth in the league with 13 triples and slugged five home runs. In an era when players rarely hit double-digit home runs for a season, five was enough for people to take notice.

Wheat continued his steady and consistent climb up the batting charts in 1912, hitting .305 and finishing the season among the league leaders in home runs and slugging percentage. Over the next four seasons, he continued to be among the leaders in many offensive categories, including home runs, batting average, slugging average, hits, doubles, triples, and RBI. It was during the 1912 season that Wheat married Daisy Kerr Forsman. His wife quickly became his &quot;de facto&quot; agent, encouraging him to hold out for a better contract each season. Each time Wheat held out, he received more money, the club not wanting to lose one of its best hitters and the team&#x27;s most popular player. This tactic of threatening to hold out served him well during throughout his career, including during the World War I era, when he raised and sold mules to the United States Army as pack animals. Wheat claimed that he was making so much money from his business that he wouldn&#x27;t need to play baseball at all. The team, fearing that they might lose a great player during the prime of his career, succumbed to his demands every year.

In 1916, Wheat topped off a string of seasons with a finish in the top ten in all the above categories, topping the league in total bases and slugging. He also had a career-high hitting streak, which reached 29 games. The Brooklyn Robins won the National League pennant that season. In the World Series, they faced the Boston Red Sox, who had the formidable pitching rotation of Ernie Shore, Dutch Leonard, Carl Mays, and Babe Ruth. The Red Sox won the series four games to one, holding the Robins to a .200 batting average and Wheat to a paltry .211.

During the 1917 and 1918 seasons, Wheat hit well, but missed many games due to injuries. He had tiny feet, around size 5, and this is believed to be the cause of the many nagging ankle injuries that caused to miss many games in his career. However, Wheat led the league in batting average for the only time in his career with a .335 batting average, his highest average up to that point. Despite being known as a slugger and consistently placing in the top ten in home runs, Wheat hit no home runs that season and had hit just one the season prior. Not until Rod Carew in 1972 would another player win a batting title without hitting a home run during the season.

Starting in 1919, Wheat returned to the league slugging leaders once again as the baseball began to become livelier. The Robins made their second World Series appearance in 1920, this time facing off against the Cleveland Indians. The Robins lost this series as well, 5 games to 2, although Wheat&#x27;s series average was .333. Wheat&#x27;s statistics climbed during this new live era of baseball, reaching double-digit home runs for the first time with 14 in 1921, and again three more times in the next four years. Wheat hit .320 or higher every season from 1920 through 1925, topping out with .375 in consecutive seasons. He failed to lead the league in hitting those two seasons, not getting enough at bats in 1923 to qualify, and Hornsby topped the league with .384, and in 1924, his .375 was a distant second to Hornsby&#x27;s .424.

A subtle but longstanding friction existed between Wheat and his manager, Wilbert Robinson. The friction reportedly stemmed from Robinson&#x27;s belief that Wheat pursued the manager&#x27;s job behind his back. When owner Charles Ebbets died in 1925, new team president Ed McKeever reassigned Robinson into the front office and named Wheat as player-manager. Newspapers confirm that he managed the Dodgers for two weeks. McKeever caught pneumonia at Ebbets&#x27; funeral, and died soon afterward, and Robinson quickly returned to the manager&#x27;s position. As it turned out, Wheat never again managed in the majors, much to his disappointment. Moreover, Wheat&#x27;s 1925 managerial stint never made it into the official records. In 1931, Steve McKeever, Ed&#x27;s brother, hired Wheat as a coach, leading to widespread speculation that he was being groomed for the manager&#x27;s spot, threatening Robinson&#x27;s job for a second time in seven years, and he treated his former star as coldly as ever.

Wheat was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics after his release from Brooklyn in 1927. After the season, he was released again; this time he signed and played for the minor league Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. Wheat played very little that season due to a heel injury, and retired from playing following the season. He still holds the Dodger franchise records for hits, doubles, triples and total bases.

==Career statistics==
In 2,410 games over 19 seasons, Wheat posted a .317 batting average (2,884-for-9,106) with 1,289 runs, 476 doubles, 172 triples, 132 home runs, 1,248 RBI, 205 stolen bases, 650 bases on balls, .367 on-base percentage and .450 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .966 fielding percentage as a left fielder. In 12 World Series games (1916,1920), he batted .283 (13-for-46) with 4 runs, 2 doubles, 1 triple, 3 RBI and 3 walks.

==Post-career==
After Wheat retired from baseball, he moved back to his farm in Polo, Missouri, until the Great Depression forced him to sell it in 1932. He moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he operated a bowling alley with Cotton Tierney. Wheat later became a police officer. During his duties as an officer in 1936, he crashed his vehicle while pursuing a felon, and nearly died. Following five months in hospital after the accident, he moved his family to Sunrise Beach, Missouri, a resort town on the Lake of the Ozarks, where he opened a hunting and fishing resort.

Wheat was first voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1957, but could not be inducted because he had not been retired for the required 30 years. The committee unanimously elected him in 1959. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. In 2006, the stretch of Route 13 that runs through Caldwell County, Missouri was named the &quot;Zach Wheat Memorial Highway&quot;. 

Due to the long-held belief about his supposed Cherokee ancestry, Wheat was featured in &quot;Baseball&#x27;s League of Nations: A Tribute to Native Americans in Baseball&quot;, a 2008 exhibit at the Iroquois Indian Museum in Howes Cave, N.Y.

Wheat died of a heart attack on March 11, 1972.

==Legacy==
The American Legion Post in Sunrise Beach, Missouri, where Wheat lived following his retirement, is named &quot;Zachariah (Zack) Davis Wheat Post 624 American Legion, Sunrise Beach, Missouri&quot; in his honor.

<text>Nathaniel Everett Green FRAS (21 August 1823 – 10 November 1899) was an English painter, art teacher and astronomer. He professionally painted landscapes and portraits, and also gained fame with his drawings of planets.

Born in Bristol, the son of Benjamin Holder Green (1793–1865), then a haberdasher, and Elizabeth ‘Betsey’ née Everett (1795–1837); his interest in astronomy dated from 1859 when he built a telescope for himself. He produced &quot;soft-pencil&quot; drawings of Mars in 1877, which were widely known. Shortly after drawing them, he was the first to suggest that canals on Mars were an optical illusion.

In 1880 he was called to Balmoral and taught art to some members of the royal family, including Queen Victoria.

He was founding member of the British Astronomical Association (BAA) and its president from 1896 to 1898.

Green married Elizabeth Goold in 1847. Their daughter, Anne Goold Green, married English landscape painter Laurence George Bomford.

A crater on Mars was named in his honor.

<text>James Albert Ogilvie &quot;Odie&quot; Cleghorn (September 19, 1891 – July 13, 1956) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player, coach, linesman and referee. His brother Sprague Cleghorn also played professional ice hockey and the two played several seasons together.

==Ice hockey career==
Odie Cleghorn came up through the ranks of the Montreal Westmount of the intermediate section of the CAHL, where he played alongside his older brother Sprague and future Hockey Hall of Fame referee Cooper Smeaton. For the 1909–10 season the trio left for New York to play for the New York Wanderers of the American Amateur Hockey League, finishing second in the league standing behind the New York Athletic Club. Although the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; praised Cleghorn after the season as &quot;one of the best right wings that ever has played on a New York team&quot;, the newspaper also brought criticism over his rough play &quot;that kept him with the timers for long sessions in every contest.

The next season, in 1910–11, Odie and Sprague left New York to play with the Renfrew Creamery Kings of the National Hockey Association.

Cleghorn played ten seasons in the National Hockey League for the Montreal Canadiens and Pittsburgh Pirates. On Jan. 14, 1922, Odie and his brother Sprague Cleghorn each scored 4 goals in a 10-6 victory for the Montreal Canadiens over the Hamilton Tigers. Cleghorn won a Stanley Cup in 1924 with Montreal.

Cleghorn was also a coach of the Pirates. It was during the 1925–26 season that he created the idea of set lines. He would play three set lines that would rotate. Before this, the players would only rest when needed.

During the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals, when New York Rangers&#x27;s coach Lester Patrick had to step in as goalie for an injured Lorne Chabot, Odie took over Lester&#x27;s duties as coach behind the Rangers bench for the rest of the game.

Cleghorn refereed for a time in the NHL. He was the referee at Boston Garden during the infamous December 12, 1933 game in which Boston&#x27;s Eddie Shore severely injured Toronto&#x27;s Irvine (Ace) Bailey, fracturing his skull and nearly killing him. Cleghorn was severely criticized by hockey writers for his lenient handling of the volatile game.

Odie Cleghorn&#x27;s brother Sprague Cleghorn died of injuries following a car accident. Just a few hours before Sprague&#x27;s July 14, 1956 funeral, Odie Cleghorn, was found in his bed, dead of heart failure, perhaps induced by the stress of the loss of his brother.

<doc id="846067" wikidata="Q1065485" url="?curid=846067" title="Calculating Infinity">
<text>Calculating Infinity is the debut studio album by American metalcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan. Recorded at Trax East Recording Studio in South River, New Jersey, it was produced by engineer Steve Evetts with the band&#x27;s guitarist Ben Weinman and drummer Chris Pennie, and released on September 28, 1999, by Relapse Records. &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; is the band&#x27;s only full-length album to feature original vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, who left the band in 2001.

Media response to &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; was positive, with critics praising the aggressive nature of the album&#x27;s material, as well as the complexity of the arrangement and instrumental work. Several publications have highlighted it as a landmark release in the Dillinger Escape Plan&#x27;s catalogue and in hardcore punk and heavy metal as a whole. They also credited its influence on the genres and on the work of several subsequent bands. The record is also classified as metalcore, avant-garde metal, and grindcore, in addition to being highlighted as one of the first mathcore albums. Its lyrical themes mostly revolve around failing relationships and insecurity. By 2013, &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; had sold in excess of 100,000 copies worldwide.

== Background ==
In 1998, The Dillinger Escape Plan wrote and recorded the EP &quot;Under the Running Board&quot;. During this time period, The Dillinger Escape Plan gained notoriety in the hardcore punk scene for the intensity of their performances which were increasingly wild, and often violent. This reputation, as well as the creative, technical approach of their music, led to Relapse Records offering the band a multi-record contract. Shortly after the release of &quot;Under the Running Board&quot;, rhythm guitarist John Fulton left the band to focus on his computer programming studies.

==Recording and production==
Recording for &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; took place in March, April, and June 1999 at Trax East Recording Studio in South River, New Jersey, with production led by Steve Evetts alongside lead guitarist Ben Weinman and drummer Chris Pennie. The recording process has been described by Weinman as &quot;extremely difficult&quot; due to technological limitations, and he was &quot;very unhappy&quot; with the recordings at first. In an interview with &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine, the guitarist added: &quot;In the studio it was really hard, because at the time we didn&#x27;t use Pro Tools and did everything to tape&quot;. The group also ran out of money during the process, resorting to trading their individual publishing rights for the songs to their label Relapse Records in return for $2,000. Weinman commented on this decision: &quot;We weren&#x27;t thinking about the future, just the present and how this record had to rule.&quot; Vocalist Dimitri Minakakis agreed: &quot;We weren&#x27;t focused on what the record could possibly do; we just wanted a record we were happy with,&quot; adding that it was a decision agreed to by every member of the band.

The band&#x27;s original bassist Adam Doll was unable to contribute to the recording of &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; after suffering a spinal fracture in a road traffic accident shortly before recording began, leaving Weinman to handle bass duties. Speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; about Doll&#x27;s injury, Weinman described it as &quot;a life-changing moment&quot; for the band, adding: &quot;It was difficult to think about moving forward, but I felt he would get better and I wanted to make something for him to come back to&quot;. Rhythm guitarist Brian Benoit joined the band partway through the recording process and contributed additional guitar recordings to a handful of tracks, as well as writing a guitar part on &quot;Clip the Apex... Accept Instruction&quot; and assisting with vocal arrangements on &quot;Variations on a Cocktail Dress&quot;. When asked whether the band considered delaying the recording of the album until Benoit was &quot;fully integrated&quot; into the band, Weinman responded: &quot;The idea was ... for us to progress and build on what we had done&quot; rather than &quot;stopping our progression waiting for someone else to catch up&quot;; Benoit also commented: &quot;I knew my role, which was getting up to par live&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; was released on September 28, 1999, with Relapse Records issuing it on CD and Hydra Head Records releasing a vinyl edition. The album was released later in Japan on April 5, 2000, featuring bonus tracks &quot;The Mullet Burden&quot;, &quot;Sandbox Magician&quot; and &quot;Abe the Cop&quot; (the three tracks comprising &quot;Under the Running Board&quot;). To promote the album, The Dillinger Escape Plan opened for Mr. Bungle on the first leg of their &quot;California&quot; tour on Mr. Bungle frontman Mike Patton&#x27;s invitation, and appeared on the Warped Tour and at various rock festivals. Patton was reportedly introduced to the band after being given the album, but he had been &quot;one of the first people&quot; to hear the album according to Weinman.

&quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; was reissued on vinyl alongside 2004&#x27;s &quot;Miss Machine&quot; and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Ire Works&quot; on November 27, 2015, marking the first time in more than ten years the album had been released on the format. The album reportedly sold in excess of 100,000 units worldwide, which made The Dillinger Escape Plan the best-selling artist on Relapse at the time.

==Composition and lyrics==
Commentators have primarily categorised &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; as mathcore due to its frequent use of complex time signatures, atypical rhythms and unpredictable tempo changes. Many have claimed that The Dillinger Escape Plan &quot;pioneered&quot; or even &quot;created&quot; the genre with the release of their debut album. Others have described the album&#x27;s style as metalcore, avant-garde metal, hardcore punk, grindcore, and post-hardcore. Speaking to &quot;The Independent&quot;, the band&#x27;s guitarist Weinman suggested that the challenging nature of the album&#x27;s material was intentional, explaining that &quot;&quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; was us effectively ripping up the music theory book; if someone said &#x27;don&#x27;t harmonize with a second, it just sounds out of tune&#x27;, then every single lead we did, we&#x27;d harmonize with a second. It sounded disgusting, but we did it&quot;. Natalie Zina Walschots of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; described the album&#x27;s style as &quot;even more avant-garde&quot; than the band&#x27;s first two extended plays, which she had noted featuring &quot;complex and technical guitar work&quot;, &quot;unpredictable shifts in tempo and tone&quot; and &quot;fractured song structures&quot;. &quot;Decibel&quot; writer Daniel Lake described the album as a combination of &quot;gouts of noise, rhythmic chaos, jazzy runs and cinematic interludes&quot;.

According to vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, the majority of the lyrical content on &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; is based on his experience in dysfunctional relationships. Speaking to &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine, Minakakis explained that &quot;Most of my Dillinger lyrics were predicated on myself ... I just had stupid relationships with idiotic people, and I&#x27;d just write a song about it&quot;, concluding that &quot;most of the lyrics on &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; were based on human insecurity. That&#x27;s where I got the best material.&quot; The album&#x27;s title was suggested by guitarist Brian Benoit, who recalled to &quot;Decibel&quot;: &quot;Since so much of the material lyrically was about failing relationships, I kind of took it as a &quot;love not lasting forever&quot; sort of thing ... Obviously, forever – or infinity – isn&#x27;t going to happen ... so let&#x27;s see how long we can calculate before this blows up in our face.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==

Critical response to &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; was positive. AllMusic writer Jason Hundey described the album as &quot;spew[ing] forth anger and venomous misery in a way that is comparable only to spontaneous combustion&quot;, adding that it expands upon &quot;the ultra-aggressive, deliciously technical approach they adopt toward grind and hardcore&quot;. Hundey praised the release for being &quot;both screechingly abrasive ... and morbidly beautiful&quot;, dubbing it &quot;explosive and brilliant&quot;, singling the tracks &quot;43% Burnt&quot; and &quot;Weekend Sex Change&quot; out for praise. &quot;Decibel&quot;″s Kevin Stewart-Panko wrote: &quot;Regardless of what you think about &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot;, you can&#x27;t deny that the 11 tracks on this album revolutionized extreme music and raised the bar in terms of technicality, musicianship, speed, dynamics,&quot; describing it as a &quot;groundbreaking metallic hardcore album&quot;. The &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; noted that &quot;this noisy album is almost painful to listen to, but it&#x27;s compelling enough to turn you into a happy masochist.&quot; &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine ranked the album as the 15th best release of the year, while &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; also included it in a retrospective top ten list for 1999 published in 2017.

&quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; has since been lauded as a landmark release for the band and the genre. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it the 56th greatest metal album of all-time in a 2017 feature, praising it for featuring &quot;an underlying logic, [and] a sense of structure that lifted songs ... to a realm above the noise and fury of everyday hardcore&quot;. In 2023, they listed &quot;43% Burnt&quot; as the 97th greatest metal song of all time. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; columnist Stephen Hill claimed that the album &quot;changed the face of metal&quot; and demonstrated that the members of the band were &quot;serious and inventive musicians, not just one dimensional noisemongers&quot;. Writing for MetalSucks, Amy Sciaretto suggested that &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; was the album &quot;that made Dillinger so revered by the metal underground, and obviously, those listening to metal&quot;, while &quot;Alternative Press&quot; writer Colin McGuire described the album as &quot;one of the most influential collections of experimental metal the genre has seen in the last two decades&quot;. &quot;Metal Injection&quot; ranked &quot;Calculating Infinity&quot; as the sixth best debut album in heavy metal in a 2016 feature, while &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked it at number ten on their own list on the same topic in 2017, with writer Graham Hartmann hailing it as &quot;the most spastic, mathematical, chaotic and contradicting metal album ever released&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; later listed the record at number three on their list of the &quot;25 Best Metalcore albums of all-time&quot;.

<text>Wax was an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, California. Wax emerged during the pop punk resurgence of the early 1990s, and included Joe Sib, Tom &quot;Soda&quot; Gardocki, Dave Georgeff, and Loomis Fall. The band is best known for their MTV buzz clip video &quot;California&quot;, directed by Spike Jonze.

==History==
&quot;13 Unlucky Numbers&quot; included the single &quot;California&quot;, whose music video was later called &quot;infamous&quot; by &quot;NME&quot; and has been included on Artforum&#x27;s website. The video depicted a man on fire running in slow motion, and was quickly banned from daytime airplay on MTV. It was included on a retrospective DVD of the director, Spike Jonze, where a still from the video was also shown on the cover of the collection. The video was also included in an episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. The song became a moderate hit on American rock radio, reaching No. 28 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts in 1995.

<doc id="846084" wikidata="Q1204366" url="?curid=846084" title="A Room of One's Own">
<text>A Room of One&#x27;s Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf, first published in 1929. The work is based on two lectures Woolf delivered in October 1928 at Newnham College and Girton College, women&#x27;s colleges at the University of Cambridge.

In her essay, Woolf uses metaphors to explore social injustices and comments on women&#x27;s lack of free expression. Her metaphor of a fish explains her most essential point, &quot;A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction&quot;. She writes of a woman whose thought had &quot;let its line down into the stream&quot;. As the woman starts to think of an idea, a guard enforces a rule whereby women are not allowed to walk on the grass. Abiding by the rule, the woman loses her idea.

==History==
The essay was based on two papers Woolf read on 20 and 26 October 1928 to two Cambridge student societies, the Newnham Arts Society at Newnham College and the ODTAA Society (&quot;One Damn Thing After Another&quot;) at Girton College, respectively. Elsie Duncan-Jones, then known as Elsie Phare, was the president of the Newnham Arts Society at the time and wrote an account of the paper, &quot;Women and Fiction&quot;, for the college magazine, &quot;Thersites&quot;. Woolf stayed at Newnham at the invitation of Pernel Strachey, the college principal, whose family were key members of the Bloomsbury Group. At Girton she was accompanied by Vita Sackville-West. It was published in 1929 as a book with six chapters.

On 1 January 2025 &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; entered the public domain in the United States.

==Themes==
===The Four Marys===
The title of the essay comes from Woolf&#x27;s conception that &quot;a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction&quot;. The narrator of the work is referred to early on: &quot;Here then was I (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please—it is not a matter of any importance)&quot;. The two Marys were ladies-in-waiting to Mary, Queen of Scots; they – along with Mary Carmichael – are also characters in a 16th-century Scottish ballad, Mary Hamilton, about a lady-in-waiting who is facing execution for having had a child with the King, a child she killed.

===Women&#x27;s access to education===

The essay examines whether women were capable of producing, and in fact free to produce, work of the quality of William Shakespeare, addressing the limitations that past and present women writers face.

Woolf&#x27;s father, Sir Leslie Stephen, in line with the thinking of the era, believed that only the boys of the family should be sent to school. In delivering the lectures outlined in the essay, Woolf is speaking to women who have the opportunity to learn in a formal setting. She moves her audience to understand the importance of their education, while warning them of the precariousness of their position in society. She sums up the stark contrast between how women are idealised in fiction written by men, and how patriarchal society has treated them in real life:

Women have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the beginning of time. Indeed if woman had no existence save in the fiction written by men, one would imagine her a person of the utmost importance; very various; heroic and mean; splendid and sordid; beautiful and hideous in the extreme; as great as a man, some would say greater. But this is woman in fiction. In fact, as Professor Trevelyan points out, she was locked up, beaten and flung about the room. A very queer, composite being thus emerges. Imaginatively she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant. She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history. She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger. Some of the most inspired words and profound thoughts in literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read; scarcely spell; and was the property of her husband.

====Judith Shakespeare====
In one section Woolf invents a fictional character, Judith, Shakespeare&#x27;s sister, to illustrate that a woman with Shakespeare&#x27;s gifts would have been denied the opportunity to develop them. Like Woolf, who stayed at home while her brothers went off to school, Judith is trapped in the home: &quot;She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as agog to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school.&quot;

While William learns, Judith is chastised by her parents should she happen to pick up a book, as she is inevitably abandoning some household chore to which she could be attending. Judith is betrothed, and when she does not want to marry, her father beats her, then shames her into the marriage. While William establishes himself, Judith is trapped by what is expected of women. She runs away from home to London, is harassed and laughed at when she tries to become an actor, and is finally made pregnant by an actor-manager who said he would help her. She kills herself and &quot;lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses now stop outside the Elephant and Castle&quot;. William lives on and establishes his legacy.

===Building a history of women&#x27;s writing===

In the essay, Woolf constructs a critical and historical account of women writers thus far. Woolf examines the careers of several female authors, including Aphra Behn, Jane Austen, the Brontë sisters, Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, and George Eliot.
In addition to female authors, Woolf also discusses and draws inspiration from noted scholar and feminist Jane Ellen Harrison. Harrison is presented in the essay only by her initials separated by long dashes, and Woolf first introduces Harrison as &quot;the famous scholar, could it be J---- H---- herself?&quot;

Woolf also discusses Rebecca West, questioning Desmond MacCarthy&#x27;s (referred to as &quot;Z&quot;) uncompromising dismissal of West as an &quot;&#x27;arrant feminist&#x27;&quot;. Among the men attacked for their views on women, F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead (referred to as &quot;Lord Birkenhead&quot;) is mentioned, although Woolf further rebukes his ideas in stating she will not &quot;trouble to copy out Lord Birkenhead&#x27;s opinion upon the writing of women&quot;. Birkenhead was an opponent of suffrage. The essay quotes Oscar Browning, through the words of his (possibly inaccurate) biographer H. E. Wortham, &quot;that the impression left on his mind, after looking over any set of examination papers, was that, irrespective of the marks he might give, the best woman was intellectually the inferior of the worst man&quot;.

===Lesbianism===
Woolf wrote in her diary before &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; was published that she thought when it was published she would be &quot;attacked for a feminist &amp; hinted at for a sapphist&quot;.

In one section of the book, describing the work of a fictional woman writer, Mary Carmichael, Woolf deliberately invokes lesbianism: &quot;Then may I tell you that the very next words I read were these – &#x27;Chloe liked Olivia ...&#x27; Do not start. Do not blush. Let us admit in the privacy of our own society that these things sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women.&quot; Woolf references the obscenity trial and public uproar resulting from the publishing of Radclyffe Hall&#x27;s lesbian-themed novel &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; (1928). Before she can discuss Chloe liking Olivia, the narrator has to be assured that Sir Chartres Biron, the magistrate of Hall&#x27;s obscenity trial, is not in the audience: &quot;Are there no men present? Do you promise the figure of Sir Chartres Biron is not concealed? We are all women, you assure me? Then I may tell you ...&quot;

Woolf scholar and feminist critic Jane Marcus believes Woolf was giving Radclyffe Hall and other writers a demonstration of how to discuss lesbianism discreetly enough to avoid obscenity trials; &quot;Woolf was offering her besieged fellow writer a lesson in how to give a lesbian talk and write a lesbian work and get away with it.&quot;

=== Androgyny ===
Marilyn R. Farwell has shed light on the difficulty around understanding androgyny in Woolf&#x27;s work. Nancy Topping Bazin defines Woolf&#x27;s concept of androgyny as &quot;the masculine and feminine should be balanced but not fused.&quot; In her definition, Bazin reveals an important debate in understanding androgyny: whether to see it as a balance or fusion of two parts.

Some critics describe Woolf&#x27;s concept of androgyny as a balance between various poles: intuition and reason, subjectivity and objectivity, anima and animus, heterosexuality and homosexuality, and manic and depressive. Androgyny in a writer translates to accepting both intuition and rationality as a way to knowledge. The interpretation of androgyny as balance would imply validating many voices and perceptions.

On the other hand, seeing androgyny as a fusion would validate only a single mode of knowing. Farwell argues that since &quot;the universal is most often identified with whatever is male, this definition can be and has been another means for demanding that a woman write like a man.&quot; Farwell interprets Woolf&#x27;s ambivalence in defining androgyny from fear of being called a feminist.

==Criticism==
Alice Walker responded to Woolf&#x27;s observation that only women with &#x27;a room of their own&#x27; are in a position to write. Woolf herself was making the point that not all women in her society had such a safe space, but Walker continues the conversation by discussing the further exclusions suffered by women of colour. In &quot;In Search of Our Mothers&#x27; Gardens: Womanist Prose&quot;, Walker writes:
== Adaptations and influence ==

&quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; was adapted as a play by Patrick Garland that premiered in 1989 with Eileen Atkins; a television adaptation of that play was broadcast on PBS &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; in 1991.

Patricia Lamkin&#x27;s play &quot;Balancing the Moon&quot; (2011) was inspired by the essay.

Cultural ventures have been named after &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;. In 1975 the Wisconsin bookstore A Room of One&#x27;s Own was founded by five women as a feminist bookstore. A literary journal launched in Vancouver, Canada in 1975 by the West Coast Feminist Literary Magazine Society, or the Growing Room Collective, was originally called &quot;Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; but changed to &quot;Room&quot; in 2007. Additionally, the Leather Archives and Museum, founded in 1991, had in 2016 an exhibit called A Room of Her Own, about which curator Alex Warner has written, &quot;As I began work for the first exhibit installation of the Women&#x27;s Leather History Project, I was excited that we were both literally and figuratively making room for Leatherwomen&#x27;s history in the LA&amp;M. It was out of this line of thinking that &quot;A Room of Her Own&quot; emerged, building on Virginia Woolf&#x27;s 1929 feminist text that argues for women&#x27;s need for space to think and create&quot;.

Following the departure of the band&#x27;s original vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, the temporary plan to record with Patton was in place before a permanent replacement vocalist had been found, yet by the time Patton had recorded vocals and the EP was released, the band had been touring with new vocalist Greg Puciato for nearly a year.

==Reception==
&quot;Irony Is a Dead Scene&quot; was generally reviewed well, and Patton&#x27;s contributions to the band&#x27;s sound was considered a successful experiment. Bradley Torreano of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying, &quot;Despite the ridiculously high expectations from both artists&#x27; fan bases, Irony Is a Dead Scene is a brilliant collaboration between the two.&quot;

<text>Amir Kabir Publishers (; Entišarat-e Amir Kabir; also romanized as &quot;Amir-Kabir&quot; or &quot;Amar-i Kabir&quot;) is a publishing house based in Tehran, Iran and founded on November 19, 1949, by Abdorrahim &quot;Taghi&quot; Jafari. It is named after Mirza Taghi Khan Amirkabir (better known as Amir Kabir) (1807–1852), who was chief minister during the reign of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and is sometimes referred to as the Amirkabir Publication Institute.

== Company history ==
Following the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the Iranian government seized Amir Kabir Publishers&#x27;s assets. Subsequently, the organization&#x27;s new owners imposed a new management structure. The publishing house is still active, but only publishes previously published material, classics, and conservative new books. Amir Kabir Publishers is the publisher of &quot;The Persian Encyclopedia&quot;.

The Amir Kabir Publishers edition of Sadegh Hedayat&#x27;s novel (&quot;The Blind Owl&quot;) was one of the titles selected for the Library of Congress 2014 &quot;A Thousand Years of the Persian Book&quot; exhibition.

The firm regularly attends the Tehran International Book Fair and overseas book fairs, including at Frankfurt and Bologna.

<doc id="846109" wikidata="Q581334" url="?curid=846109" title="Fluticasone/salmeterol">
<text>Fluticasone/salmeterol, sold under the brand name Advair among others, is a fixed-dose combination medication containing fluticasone propionate, an inhaled corticosteroid; and salmeterol, a long-acting beta2‑adrenergic agonist. It is used in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is used by inhaling the medication into the lungs.
Common side effects include thrush, headache, and cough. Serious side effects may include worsening asthma, anaphylaxis, seizures, and heart problems. Safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear. Fluticasone, a corticosteroid, works by decreasing inflammation while salmeterol, a long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA), works by activating beta-2 adrenergic receptors.
The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 2000. A generic version was approved in the United States in 2019. In 2022, it was the 59th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 11million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Fluticasone/salmeterol is indicated for the treatment of asthma.

Fluticasone, a corticosteroid, is the anti-inflammatory component of the combination which decreases inflammation in the lungs. This leads to improvement in breathing. Salmeterol, a long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist, treats constriction of the airways. The combination of both is meant to be used as maintenance therapy and not as a rescue therapy for sudden symptoms.

==Side effects==
The common side effects of this combination are those of its individual drugs. For instance, the use of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with oral candidiasis, commonly known as yeast infection or thrush. Rinsing the mouth with water after inhaling the medication decreases the risk of developing this condition.

While the use of inhaled steroids and long-acting beta2‑adrenergic agonists are recommended for the resulting improvement in control of symptoms of asthma, concerns have been raised that salmeterol may increase the risk of death due to asthma, and this additional risk is not reduced by the addition of inhaled steroids. Other side effects from this drug combination may include increased blood pressure, change in heart rate, an irregular heartbeat, increased risk of osteoporosis, cataracts, and glaucoma. Studies have demonstrated the safety of inhaled fluticasone propionate in children. A systematic review published in 2013 found no significant adverse effect on the function of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, growth, and bone mineral density in asthmatic children when inhaled fluticasone is used for up to three months.

==Mechanism of action==
Fluticasone/salmeterol contains fluticasone propionate, a synthetic corticosteroid, and salmeterol, a selective long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. Fluticasone works as a potent anti-inflammatory agent, inhibiting multiple cell types such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils all of which contribute to inflammation, a large component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Salmeterol works by stimulating intracellular adenyl cyclase, which acts as a catalyst in the production of cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels lead to a relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles. Additionally, cyclic AMP inhibits the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity.

==Society and culture==

=== Legal status ===
In January 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Seffalair Spiromax, intended for the treatment of asthma. The applicant for this medicinal product is Teva B.V. The CHMP also recommended the granting of a marketing authorization for the duplicate product BroPair Spiromax. Seffalair Spiromax and BroPair Spiromax were both approved for medical use in the European Union in March 2021.

===Generic equivalents===
In January 2019, the FDA granted Mylan the first generic approval for Advair Diskus.

===Civil settlements===
In 2012, Advair was part of a larger civil settlement agreement between GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the United States, in which GSK agreed to pay $1.043 billion; the United States said that GSK promoted off-label uses of Advair and paid kickbacks to healthcare professionals to sell this drug, among others.

<text>Carl Ernst Albrecht Hartwig (14 January 1851 in Frankfurt – 3 May 1923 in Bamberg) was a German astronomer.

On 20 August 1885, Hartwig discovered a new star, SN 1885A (S Andromedae), in the Andromeda Galaxy, which was the first supernova that was ever seen that was outside the Milky Way. He is also credited for the discovery and co-discovery of three parabolic and hyperbolic comets, namely C/1879 Q2, C/1880 S1 and C/1886 T1. In 1882, Hartwig observed the transit of Venus in Argentina. During the 1883 observation campaign of comet 6P/d&#x27;Arrest he found five NGC objects working at the Strasbourg Observatory. In 1874 he became assistant at the Observatory of Strasbourg, 1884 astronomer at Dorpat Observatory and 1887 director of the Remeis Observatory at Bamberg. 

The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Valz Prize in 1902 for his heliometer observations and work on variable stars. Lunar crater &quot;Hartwig&quot; and Martian crater &quot;Hartwig&quot; were both named in his honor.

<doc id="846125" wikidata="Q2102361" url="?curid=846125" title="Emu Park, Queensland">
<text>Emu Park is a coastal town and locality on the Capricorn Coast located south of Yeppoon in Queensland, Australia. It is within the local government area of Shire of Livingstone (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Rockhampton Region). In the , the locality of Emu Park had a population of 2,281 people.

Home of the famous Singing Ship Monument, the Emu Park land area was explored by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. It overlooks the islands of Keppel Bay, including Great Keppel Island. Emu Park is a popular tourist spot, and has won several tourism awards, and features fishing, surfing, boating, and unspoiled beaches.

==Geography==

Emu Park is part of the Capricorn Coast in Central Queensland.

Off-shore to the north is Shoal Bay (). 

Emu Park has the following coast features (from north to south):

* Tanby Point ()
*Fishermans Beach ()
*Emu Point ()

The northern part of the locality is mostly undeveloped wetlands around Shoal Water Creek () which flows into Shoal Bay, while the southern part of the locality is undeveloped wetlands around an unnamed creek. The eastern strip of the locality near the coast is urban in character with housing and services. The centre and west of the locality is mostly used for grazing on native vegetation with some areas of rural residential housing.

Emu Park Airstrip is at the northern end of Henry Street ().

==History==
===Early settlement===
The Keppel Bay area was explored by Lieutenant James Cook on the HM Bark Endeavour in May 1770. He named the bay after Admiral Augustus Keppel of the Royal Navy.

British settlement began in the 1860s when John Jardine established a cattle grazing property south of the current town, at Zilzie, an anagram of &quot;Lizzie,&quot; the eldest of John Jardine&#x27;s daughters.

Emu Park township was established in the 1870s when several Rockhampton families built seaside holiday houses on the hills overlooking the two beaches that are a feature of the town – Fisherman&#x27;s Beach and Pine Beach.

Hewittville Post Office opened on 12 November 1883 (a receiving office had been open from 1876) and was renamed Emu Park in 1890.

Emu Park State School opened on 3 February 1890. The school was burned down on 26 July 1946 and all early records of the school were lost in the blaze. The hall was used as a temporary school. The new school building was designed with 2 classrooms for a total 60 students at a cost of £2315.
===Central business district===
Soon after the town was settled, a commercial area was established in and around Hill Street. Some of the early stores included a general store, a grocery store, butcher shop, bakery, and a combined sweet and haberdashery store.

By the 1920s the town had two large hotels, a cinema, court house, public library, shops and many guest houses for visitors. A small pier was opened by Ethel Bruce, wife of the Prime Minister, Stanley Bruce, in 1926 and Bell Park, a shady park on the shores of Fisherman&#x27;s Beach was established in the 1930s.

The town&#x27;s general store was owned by several families over the years including the Ryan, Mills and Bundesen families.

A haberdashery and sweet shop was owned by well known community stalwart Henny Power.

A grocery shop was owned by several families before being bought by the Notaras family who converted the shop into Seagulls Cafe. It was then bought by the Stouraitis family who ran a fish and chip shop from the building before it was destroyed in a fire in 1961.

The Large family leased the Central Cafe in 1934 where they established the Britanic Cafe selling meals while also offering a range of groceries. The shop remained in the family until 1982. It was later bought by the Charlesworth family who ran it as a local grocery store &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Corner&quot; until 2012 when it closed after the opening of the town&#x27;s first supermarket the previous year. In 2018, the Emu Park Post Office was relocated to the building.

A general merchant&#x27;s shop was located in Archer Street next to the Catholic Church from the 1890s until its closure in 1940. Known as &quot;The Village Store&quot; when it was run by the Ryan family, it sold a large variety of grocery items including local produce traded with South Sea Islanders. The building was demolished in the 1980s.

The original butcher shop was built on the corner of Hill and Archer Street in 1912 and closed in 1996 before a new butcher shop was established. The first newsagency opened in a shop beside the Grand Central Hotel in 1938, beside a bakery.

In 2011, the town&#x27;s first supermarket was opened when the Emu Park Village Centre, anchored by a Super IGA-branded supermarket (owned by Drakes Supermarkets), was opened. The popularity of the new supermarket contributed to the closure of the town&#x27;s firmly established general store, Charlie&#x27;s Corner, which ceased trading on 30 November 2012. A compliance issue regarding Sunday trading forced Supa IGA to temporarily cease trading on Sundays in 2014, leaving the town without a grocery store for one day of the week which caused much angst and frustration in the community. The issue was resolved soon after. In line with the other 21 Drakes-owned stores in Queensland, the Supa IGA branding was completely dropped and the Emu Park supermarket was solely rebranded as a Drakes Supermarkets store in 2017. 

As of 2022, a large variety of small businesses continue to trade in town&#x27;s central business district, including two bakeries, several cafes and takeaway outlets, a newsagency, the post office, a chemist, a butcher shop, a petrol station, real estate agencies, a charity shop, a tobacco shop, a discount store, hair and beauty outlets and a community bank.

===Railway===
From 1888 to 1964, Emu Park was serviced by the North Rockhampton to Emu Park railway line. A branch to Yeppoon, further to the north was opened in 1910.

The railway officially opened on 22 December 1888. The original trains that serviced Emu Park from Rockhampton ran from North Rockhampton railway station prior to the Alexandra Railway Bridge across the Fitzroy River being opened in 1899 connecting the line with the stations on the southern side of Rockhampton including Archer Park and the main Stanley Street station. 

The original railway line was surveyed as a more direct route to Emu Park with the line coming into the town from the western side of Emu Park instead of the more indirect route which was eventually chosen through Tanby and into the town from the north which increased the length of the line to 29 miles from the original 20 mile line originally surveyed.

The commuter trains were established in 1914, which took workers and school students to Rockhampton each morning.

The Emu Park railway station and engine sheds received considerable damage from the 1949 Central Queensland cyclone. The carriage shed was completely destroyed while the other shed was demolished. The railway station was repaired.

Until a high school was built in Yeppoon, local secondary students used the train to travel to Rockhampton, departing at 6:55am each morning.

The Emu Park station master lived in a residence with a detached kitchen in Hill Street. After the line was closed, the house was demolished and the Emu Park Cultural Centre was built on the site.

There was a turntable for locomotives to be turned around installed in 1905, remnants of which are still visible outside the Don Ireland Swimming Complex. Before the line closed, an overhead bridge was built across the railway line near Albermarle Street.

The railway closed on 30 June 1964.

The railway goods shed built in 1888 remained in the railway precinct until 1992 when the Emu Park Lions Club successfully applied to have the building relocated with the intention for it to be used as a youth clubhouse. &quot;The Shack&quot; opened in 1994. It was extended in 2016 and continues to be used by the Lions Club as their clubhouse and for organised youth activities.

The former railway precinct is now the site of the Emu Park bus interchange and the Emu Park Community Arts Centre which was opened in 2020.

The railway line from North Rockhampton was officially opened on Saturday 22 December 1888 by Archibald Archer, the local Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Rockhampton. Emu Park railway station was on the northern corner of Hill Street and Pattison Street ().

===Churches===
In November 1893, Emu Park&#x27;s first church was the Christ Church (a Church of England church), a timber building constructed on the corner of Fountain Street and Hill Street opposite Emu Park State School. After access to the site proved difficult during wet weather, the church was relocated to its existing location on the corner of Archer Street and Hunter Street. The church was extended in 1919 to provide more comfort for the vicars who would travel down by buggy from Rockhampton. The church was restored in 1984 and continues to hold services. 

The second church to be built in Emu Park was the original Mary Immaculate Catholic Church which was opened in Archer Street on 25 September 1904. A school room was opened under the presbytery at the back of the building in 1917. The school was moved into a neighbouring property in 1920 and became known as St Agnes&#x27; Convent School. The church was enlarged with two wings and a sacristy added to the building. The renovated church opened on 23 December 1923. The school was renovated in 1959 and remained in use until 1965. The original church was demolished in 1974 when it became unsafe. The vacant school building was transformed into a church and opened on 26 May 1974. By 1984, the former school building was struggling to accommodate the large congregation and funds were raised to build a brand new church building which was opened on 8 December 1984, close to where the original 1904 building once stood. The Mary Immaculate Catholic continues to hold services. The church&#x27;s centenary was celebrated on 25 November 2004.

The existing Uniting Church building in Archer Street was originally built as a billiard saloon which was opened in December 1916 by Thomas Charles Lachlan. The saloon was forced to close when most of the young men who used the venue enlisted in the armed services during World War I. The Methodist Church purchased the building in November 1919. Following the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, it became the Emu Park Uniting Church. Although the building needed repairs after sustaining damage during Tropical Cyclone Marcia in 2015, weekly church services continue to be held from the building.

===Hotels===
The first hotel to be opened in Emu Park was The Brighton. It was built in 1871 and run by Eliza Pearson who was granted the license on 12 December 1871. After being refurbished, it was re-opened by Ferguson McHarg as the Blue Bell Hotel in November 1879. It was demolished and rebuilt in 1888 when it was re-opened by George Birch as the Grand Hotel in 1888. The Grand Hotel was destroyed in a fire on 20 November 1908 which killed district schools inspector Thomas Russell Brown. Rockhampton mayor Harry Medcraf who was also staying at the hotel managed to escape the fire. A palatial house was then built on the site and purchased by the Begg family who converted it into the Pine Beach Hotel which opened on 13 March 1926. The Pine Beach Hotel continues to trade from the site on the corner of Pattison Street and Granville Street.

The Emu Park Hotel became the town&#x27;s second hotel in 1874 when Philip Downer was granted the license on 11 December 1874. After Fred Comley purchased the hotel in 1885, a hall was constructed next to the hotel which was opened on 8 March 1889. Prior to the school building being finished in Fountain Street, Emu Park State School was originally opened in the hall on 3 February 1890 with Benjamin Long becoming the school&#x27;s first head teacher. When the school was destroyed in a fire on 26 July 1946, school students once again returned to Comley&#x27;s Hall until the new school buildings were opened in 1948. After being renovated, the Emu Park Hotel was renamed Hotel Riviera in October 1927. The hall was destroyed in the Central Queensland cyclone on 2 March 1949 when it collapsed against the side of the hotel, which also sustained considerable damage. Later that same year, the hotel was destroyed in a fire on 27 September 1949.

In the late 1880s, the Imperial Hotel was built in Hill Street. The proposal for a third hotel in Emu Park was met with opposition from the existing licensees as they believed the community was not yet big enough to sustain three hotels. In July 1888, George Wickham applied for the hotel license but was refused. Several months later, William Toon managed to successfully apply for the license to run the Imperial Hotel and the business was opened soon after. The hotel was bought by the Begg family in 1911. The Imperial Hotel was destroyed by fire on 7 April 1925. A movie theatre was built on the site in 1950 which was bought by the Green family in 1969 who transformed the building into a hardware store. The building was demolished in 1992 to make way for a row of new retail outlets.

The Railway Hotel was opened by the Evans family in 1890. It was destroyed by fire on 19 June 1904. A boarding house was then built on the site which was purchased by the Begg family in 1912. The Begg&#x27;s relocated the Mount Usher Hotel from near Mount Morgan to Emu Park and rebuilt it as the Grand Central Hotel which opened on 22 March 1913. The Begg family remained as licensees until 1926 when they leased it out before returning in 1945. There was a series of ownership changes before the licensing commission cancelled the hotel&#x27;s license, after which it became a boarding house known as The Beachcomber. After the closure of the railway, The Beachcomber was sold but then remained vacant until it was demolished in 1977. In May 1987, the site was bought at auction and construction of a new building began on 7 September 1987. The Endeavour Inn was opened on the site by Denis Hinton on 26 February 1988 which continues to operate from the site.

===School of Arts===
The building now known as the School of Arts was the town&#x27;s first post and telegraph office which was built and opened in November 1883. Shortly after opening, the post office was relocated to the Emu Park Railway Station and the building became the School of Arts. Emu Park&#x27;s first library was opened in the School of Arts in 1902 with Rose McLelland becoming the town&#x27;s first librarian. Another librarian, Mary Morris, was credited with having a dance hall built on land beside the School of Arts in 1921 but it was destroyed in a fire on 27 December 1945. The current Emu Park Library opened in 1984 after the School of Arts became a medical centre in 1983, before eventually being donated to the Emu Park Museum in 2007.

===Post office===
The Emu Park Post Office was eventually relocated from the railway station to Pattison Street where the Edmistone family ran it for 65 years. It was eventually relocated again to the Emu Park Arcade in Granville Street and taken over by Kerry Kay in 1997 who ran it until his retirement in 2021. The Emu Park Post Office was relocated again to its existing location in the former general store on the corner of Hill Street and Pattison Street in April 2018.

===Community Arts Centre===
The Emu Park Community Arts Centre was officially opened on 9 December 2021, with the first exhibition in the venue being held on 11 December 2021. Livingstone Shire Council obtained $1.1 million from the state government for the project with the council also allocating $200,000 to the facility. The new arts centre was built where the railway station once stood, after the former art gallery was closed in 2019 when the building it had been situated in for 15 years was sold.

== Attractions ==
Attractions in Emu Park include:

* the Singing Ship memorial 
* the Centenary of ANZAC memorial
* Main Beach recreational area
* Lions Club heritage trail

=== Singing Ship memorial ===

The Singing Ship memorial is located on the headland accessed from Tennant Memorial Drive (). It commemorates the voyage of James Cook on the HM Bark Endeavour in May 1770 during which he explored the bay. The memorial depicts the sail, mast and rigging of the ship, and the &quot;singing&quot; is created by the wind passing through organ pipes within the memorial.

===Centenary of ANZAC memorial===
A Centenary of ANZAC memorial is located along the beachfront at the southern end of Emu Street, opposite the Emu Park RSL Sub-Branch ().

Since the first stage of the multi-faceted development opened in 2015, the memorial has become a landmark of cultural and historic significance for Central Queensland, while also serving as a tourist attraction for Emu Park itself. The memorial consists of several elements including ANZAC Court featuring a sandstone and sculpture cenotaph, a glass pane artwork, various sandstone plinths, The Gatehouse museum, battle markers, silhouettes of Australian soldiers, a boardwalk and a viewing platform.

In 2011, local artist and Vietnam veteran Ross Coulter proposed part of the Emu Park foreshore be developed to incorporate a commemorative Centenary of ANZAC memorial. Coulter&#x27;s vision was for a new memorial called Anzac Plaza to be established, to complement the existing RSL precinct where the RSL Memorial Hall had been officially opened in 1949.

However, Coulter died on 5 November 2011, the same day the plans were publicly announced. Despite his death, the RSL vowed to progress with Coulter&#x27;s vision to have a Centenary of ANZAC Memorial established in Emu Park.

A steering committee was formed in 2013 to move forward with the development which Livingstone Shire Council adopted in 2014, launching the project in partnership with the state government, Emu Park RSL, Bendigo Community Bank and Home Corp.

A symbolic groundbreaking ceremony was held in July 2014, with Coulter&#x27;s widow Kate Coulter in attendance along with various dignitaries. The first sandstone blocks of the ANZAC Court memorial feature were installed in December 2014, with the first stage of the memorial completed and commissioned in time for Anzac Day commemorations in 2015.

Prior to the 2016 Anzac Day commemorations, more than 200 people attended the official opening of The Gatehouse - a structure that houses 26 separate information panels telling the stories of local men and women from Emu Park who served during the World War I, as well as general information about the war. Later that year, three sandstone plinths were unveiled at the memorial to acknowledge the history of the RSL.

In 2017, more elements to the memorial were added including groups of silhouetted figures representing Australian soldiers, and more than forty battle markers.

Since it opened, the Centenary of ANZAC Memorial Precinct has been used for annual Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services, with more than 5000 people attending the dawn service on 25 April 2018. The landmark is popular with visitors to the town and many community groups often attend the memorial for educational purposes.

Queensland country musician Tony Cook filmed parts of the music video for his single &quot;Country Recognised&quot; at the memorial.

===Main Beach foreshore===
In 2016, it was announced the Emu Park foreshore at Main Beach would be extensively redeveloped in three stages of the Emu Park Village and Foreshore Revitalisation.

Works on the $4.62m project began in 2017 which included upgrading the Main Beach and surf club carparks, installing new barbeques, electrical works, street beautification, replacing the QCWA rotunda, and new play equipment.

Five colourful emu statues designed by local artist Bill Gannon were unveiled on 7 April 2021. However, soon after the statues were installed there were damaged in an act of vandalism which was described by Livingstone mayor Andy Ireland as &quot;disgraceful&quot;.

===Heritage trail===
In 2019, a 2.5 kilometre heritage trail incorporating 20 separate historical locations was established in the town with steel emu sculptures identifying the sites with information boards which include QR codes linked to the trail&#x27;s website.

The trail was jointly funded by the Lions Club of Emu Park, Livingstone Shire Council and the Australian Government.

<doc id="846148" wikidata="Q7201457" url="?curid=846148" title="Plant-based diet">
<text>A plant-based diet is a diet consisting mostly or entirely of plant-based foods. It encompasses a wide range of dietary patterns that contain low amounts of animal products and high amounts of fiber-rich plant products such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices. Plant-based diets may also be vegan or vegetarian but do not have to be, as they are defined in terms of high frequency of plants and low frequency of animal food consumption.

==Terminology==
Origin of the term &quot;plant-based diet&quot; is attributed to Cornell University nutritional biochemist T. Colin Campbell who presented his diet research at the US National Institutes of Health in 1980. Campbell&#x27;s research about a plant-based diet extended from &quot;The China Project&quot;, a decade-long study of dietary practices in rural China, giving evidence that a diet low in animal protein and fat, and high in plant foods, could reduce the incidence of several diseases. In 2005, Campbell and his son published &quot;The China Study&quot;, a best-selling book emphasizing the potential health benefits of a plant-based diet. Campbell also used the plant-based concept to educate consumers about how eating meat had significant environmental consequences.

Some authors draw a distinction between diets that are &quot;plant-based&quot; or &quot;plant-only&quot;. A plant-based diet may be defined as consuming plant-sourced foods that are minimally processed.

A review analyzing the use of the term &quot;plant-based diet&quot; in medical literature found that 50% of clinical trials use the term interchangeably with vegan, meaning that the interventional diet did not include foods of animal origin. 30% of studies included dairy products and 20% meat.

In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that &quot;plant-based diets constitute a diverse range of dietary patterns that emphasize foods derived from plant sources coupled with lower consumption or exclusion of animal products. Vegetarian diets form a subset of plant-based diets, which may exclude the consumption of some or all forms of animal foods.&quot; The WHO lists flexitarian, lacto-vegetarian, lacto-ovo vegetarian, ovo-vegetarian, pescatarian and vegan diets as plant-based.

A 2023 review paper defined plant-based as &quot;a dietary pattern in which foods of animal origin are totally or mostly excluded&quot;.

In 2024, the International Organization for Standardization drafted ISO 8700 on &quot;Plant-based foods and food ingredients - Definitions and technical criteria for labelling and claims&quot;.

== Motivation and prevalence ==
As of the early 21st century, some 4 billion people are estimated to live primarily on a plant-based diet, some by choice and some because of limits caused by shortages of crops, fresh water, and energy resources. Main motivations to follow a plant-based diet appear to be health aspirations, taste, animal welfare, environmental concern, and weight loss. In the U.S.A., people take individual action on climate change through their diet. Twenty-six per cent of those who eat a plant-based diet because they are &quot;alarmed&quot; about global warming — defined by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication as those who are &quot;convinced global warming is happening, human-caused, an urgent threat&quot; — and twenty-seven per cent eat a plant-based diet because they are &quot;concerned&quot; — they believe global warming is a real and serious threat and that humans are causing it, but they think climate impacts remain far enough in the future that they are a lower priority issue.

==Health guidelines and research==
Plant-based diets are of interest in preventing and managing chronic diseases. The British Dietetic Association stated that a plant-based diet &quot;can support healthy living at every age and life stage&quot;, but as with any diet it should be properly planned. The Government of Canada and Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada issued 2024 guidelines for planning meals with plant-based protein sources, including menu ideas for substituting meats with plant foods.

=== Diet quality ===
Not all plant-based foods are equally healthy. Rather, plant-based diets including whole grains as the main form of carbohydrate, unsaturated fats as the main form of dietary fat, an abundance of fruit and vegetables, and adequate n-3 fatty acids can be considered healthy.

With processed plant-based foods, such as vegan burger patties or chicken-like nuggets, becoming more available, there is also concern that plant-based diets incorporating these foods may become less healthy.

In practice lacto-ovo vegetarians or vegans seem to have a higher overall diet quality compared with nonvegetarians. The reason for this is the closer adherence to health organisation recommendations on consumption of fruits, whole grains, seafood and plant protein and sodium. The higher diet quality in vegetarians and vegans may explain some of the positive health outcomes compared with nonvegetarians.

=== Vitamin B12 ===
Plant-based foods are not a reliable source of vitamin B12 by default. A lack of B12 is associated with a range of conditions and it is essential for human health. Those eating a fully plant-based diet should ensure adequate B12 intake via supplementation or consumption of fortified foods, such as fortified plant milks or yogurts, nutritional yeast, or fortified cereals.

Even those eating a plant-based diet including a small amount of animal products are at an increased risk of a lower than recommended B12 intake without supplementation or regular consumption of fortified foods.

=== Weight ===
Observational studies show that vegetarian diets are lower in energy intake than non-vegetarian diets and that, on average, vegetarians have a lower body mass index than non-vegetarians.

Two reviews of preliminary research found that vegetarian diets practiced over 18 weeks or longer reduced body weight in the range of , with vegan diets used for 12 weeks or longer reducing body weight by 4 kg.

In obese people, a 2022 review found that plant-based diets improved weight control, LDL and total cholesterol, blood pressure, insulin resistance, and fasting glucose.

=== Diabetes ===
Some reviews indicate that plant-based diets including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts are associated with a lower risk of diabetes.

Therefore, vegetarian and vegan diets are under clinical research to identify potential effects on type 2 diabetes, with preliminary results showing improvements in body weight and biomarkers of metabolic syndrome.

When the focus was whole foods, an improvement of diabetes biomarkers occurred, including reduced obesity. In diabetic people, plant-based diets were also associated with improved emotional and physical well-being, relief of depression, higher quality of life, and better general health.

The American College of Lifestyle Medicine stated that diet can achieve remission in many adults with type 2 diabetes when used as a primary intervention of whole, plant-based foods with minimal consumption of meat and other animal products. There remains a need for more randomized controlled trials &quot;to assess sustainable plant-based dietary interventions with whole or minimally processed foods, as a primary means of treating diabetes with the goal of remission.&quot;

=== Cancer ===

Plant-based diets are associated with a decreased risk of colorectal and prostate cancer. Vegetarian diets are associated with a lower incidence from total cancer (-8%). A vegan diet seems to reduce risk of incidence from total cancer by -15%. However, there was no improvement in cancer mortality.

=== Microbiome ===
Preliminary studies indicate that a plant-based diet may improve the gut microbiome.

=== Cardiovascular diseases ===
A 2022 review of prospective cohort studies showed that vegetarian diets are associated with a 15% reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and 21% reduced risk in coronary artery disease, but with no effect on the risk of stroke; for vegan diets, only a reduced risk in coronary artery disease was found.

Other reviews found that plant-based diets, including vegan and vegetarian diets, may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including blood pressure and blood lipid levels. Randomized clinical trials also showed that the reduction in blood pressure (about 4 mmHg) associated with a vegan diet &quot;without&quot; caloric restrictions is comparable to reductions observed with dietary practices recommended by medical societies and use of portion-controlled diets.

Preliminary evidence indicates that people on a long-term vegan diet show improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors.

=== Bone health ===
The effect of plant-based diets on bone health is inconclusive. Preliminary research indicates that consuming a plant-based diet may be associated with lower bone density, a risk factor for fractures.

=== Inflammation ===
Plant-based diets are under study for their potential to reduce inflammation. C-reactive protein a biomarker for inflammation may be reduced by consuming a plant-based diet, particularly in obese people.

=== Mortality ===
A 2020 review stated that dietary patterns based on consuming vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, unsaturated vegetable oils, fish, lean meat or poultry, and are low in processed meat, high-fat dairy and refined carbohydrates or sweets, are associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality.

=== Physical performance ===
In a meta-analysis published online in 2023, plant-based diets were shown to have a moderate positive effect on aerobic performance and had no effect on strength performance.

== Sustainability ==

There is scientific consensus that plant-based diets offer lower greenhouse gas emissions, land use and biodiversity loss. In addition, dietary patterns that reduce diet-related mortality also promote environmental sustainability.

As a significant percentage of crops around the world are used to feed livestock rather than humans, eating less animal products helps to limit climate change (such as through low-carbon diets) and biodiversity loss. Especially beef, lamb and cheese have a very high carbon footprint. While soy cultivation is a &quot;major driver of deforestation in the Amazon basin&quot;, the vast majority of soy crops are used for livestock consumption rather than human consumption. Adopting plant-based diets could also reduce the number of animals raised and killed for food on factory farms.

Research from 2019 on six diets found the plant-based diets more environmentally friendly than the diets higher in animal-sourced foods. Of the six mutually-exclusive diets; individuals eating vegan, vegetarian and pescetarian diets had lower dietary-carbon footprints than typical omnivorous diets, while those who ate &#x27;paleolithic&#x27; and ketogenic diets had higher dietary-carbon emissions due to their animal sourced foods.

A 2020 study found that the climate change mitigation effects of shifting worldwide food production and consumption to plant-based diets, which are mainly composed of foods that require only a small fraction of the land and CO2 emissions required for meat and dairy, could offset CO2 emissions equal to those of past 9 to 16 years of fossil fuel emissions in nations that they grouped into 4 types. The researchers also provided a map of approximate regional opportunities.

It may be possible to increase the transition from meat eating to a plant based diet through social contagion, by which behaviour, emotions, or conditions spread spontaneously through a group or network. A Max Planck Institute study from 2020 found that when meat-eaters are accompanied by vegetarians and have a choice of eating dishes with or without meat, they&#x27;re more likely to choose a vegetarian dish. This probability increases as the number of vegetarians accompanying the meat eaters increases. Once enough people have been influenced, the community can reach a tipping point, in which a majority of people transition to a new habit; a 2018 study published in Nature claims that with only 25 per cent of a population, a minority perspective was able to overturn the majority.

According to a 2021 Chatham House report, supported by the United Nations Environment Programme, a shift to &quot;predominantly plant-based diets&quot; will be needed to reduce biodiversity loss and human impact on the environment. The report said that livestock has the largest environmental impact, with some 80% of all global farmland used to rear cattle, sheep and other animals used by humans for food. Moving towards plant-based diets would free up the land to allow for the restoration of ecosystems and the flourishing of biodiversity.

A 2022 study published in &quot;Nature Food&quot; found that if high-income nations switched to a plant-based diet, vast swaths of land used for animal agriculture could be allowed to return to their natural state, which in turn has the potential to pull 100 billion tons of out of the atmosphere by the end of the century. Around 35% of all habitable land around the world is used to rear animals used by humans in food production.

A 2023 study published in &quot;Nature Food&quot; found that a vegan diet vastly decreases the impact on the environment from food production, such as reducing emissions, water pollution and land use by 75%, reducing the destruction of wildlife by 66% and the usage of water by 54%. Another study published in the same year in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; found that replacing half of the beef, chicken, dairy and pork products consumed by the global population with plant-based alternatives could reduce the amount of land used by agriculture by almost a third, bring deforestation to a near-halt, restore biodiversity, and reduce GHG emissions from agriculture by 31% by 2050. However, the report also notes that a growing population and rising affluence are projected to increase demand for animal products which could have negative impacts on the environment.

== Politics ==
A reduction in meat consumption and a shift to more plant-based diets is needed to reach climate targets, addressing public health problems, and protecting animal welfare. Research has been done on how to best promote such a change in consumer behaviour.

Some public health organisations advocate a plant-based diet due to its low ecological footprint. These include the Swedish Food Agency in its dietary guideline and a group of &quot;Lancet&quot; researchers who propose a planetary health diet. Vegan climate activist Greta Thunberg also called for more plant-based food production and consumption worldwide. A 2022 report by the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Council On Energy, Environment and Water included protecting animal welfare and adopting plant based diets on a list of recommendations to help mitigate the ecological and social crises bringing the world to a &quot;boiling point&quot;.

Denmark and South Korea announced plant-based action plans in 2023.

<text>The Rumford Medal is an award bestowed by the Royal Society for &quot;outstanding contributions in the field of physics&quot;. The award is named in honour of British scientist Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, who is noted for his works on thermodynamics and for establishing the Royal Institution. The award was created in 1796 after Thompson transferred £1,000 to the Royal Society in stocks, instructing the latter to grant the awardee the fund&#x27;s interest as a premium. Thompson was awarded the inaugural award in 1800.

The award initially consisted of two medals, one each in silver and gold, struck in the same die. This was later replaced with a single medal made of silver gilt. The medal is awarded with a cash prize of £2,000. British painter Robert Smirke created the original design of the medal. The diameter of the medal is 3 inches (7.62 cm). The obverse featured a tripod altar with a flame upon it, circumscribed by a Latin inscription from Lucretius&#x27; poem &quot;De rerum natura&quot; &quot;Noscere quae vis et causa&quot;. The reverse had the Latin inscription &quot;Proemium optime merenti ex instituto Benj. a Rumford, S.R.I. Comitis: adjudicatum a Reg. Soc. Lond.&quot; surrounded by an ornamental border of leaves. This design was discontinued in 1863. As of 2024, the obverse of the medal has a portrait of Thompson, surrounded by the Latin inscription &quot;Beniamin Ab Rvmford S. Rom. Imp. Comes Institvit&quot; (&quot;Benjamin Rumford, Count of the Holy Roman Empire, founded this&quot;), with the Roman numeral MDCCXCVI (1796) on the exergue. The reverse has the Latin inscription &quot;Optime In Lvcis Caloqisqve Natvra Exqvirena Merenti Adivdicat Soc: Reg: Lond.&quot; (&quot;The Royal Society of London awards this to one outstandingly deserving in investigating the nature of light and heat&quot;) inscribed within a wreath of oak and laurel leaves bound with ribbons.

All citizens or residents of the Commonwealth of Nations or the Republic of Ireland for more than three years are eligible for the medal. Candidates for the medal are selected by the Royal Society Council on the recommendations of the Physical Sciences Awards Committee. Ten times during the early 19th century, no medals were awarded due to the unavailability of suitable candidates or political considerations of the Royal Society Council.

Since its inception, the medal has been granted to 108 scientists. It has been awarded to citizens of the United Kingdom sixty-seven times, France fourteen times, Germany seven times, the Netherlands seven times, Sweden four times, the United States thrice, Italy twice, Hungary twice, and once each to citizens of Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Mexico and New Zealand. The medal has been awarded to multiple individuals twice: in 1896, to Philipp Lenard and Wilhelm Röntgen and in 1918, to Charles Fabry and Alfred Perot. From 1800 to 2018, the medal was awarded biennially; since then it has been awarded annually. The most recent recipient is British physicist Tony Bell, who received it in 2024. British academic and engineer Polina Bayvel is the only female recipient.

<text>Founded in 1796, the Rumford Prize, awarded by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, is one of the oldest scientific prizes in the United States. The prize recognizes contributions by scientists to the fields of heat and light. These terms are widely interpreted; awards range from discoveries in thermodynamics to improvements in the construction of steam boilers.

The award was created through the endowment of US$5,000 to the Academy by Benjamin Thompson, who held the title &quot;Count Rumford of the United Kingdom,&quot; in 1796. The terms state that the award be given to &quot;authors of discoverie&#x27;s in any part of the Continent of America, or in any of the American islands.&quot; Although it was founded in 1796, the first prize was not given until 1839, as the academy could not find anyone who, in their judgement, deserved the award. The academy found the terms of the prize to be too restrictive, and in 1832 the Supreme Court of Massachusetts allowed the Academy to change some of the provisions; mainly, the award was to be given annually instead of biennially, and the Academy was allowed to award the prize as it saw fit, whereas before it had to give it yearly. The first award was given to Robert Hare, for his invention of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, in 1839. Twenty-three years elapsed before the award was given a second time, to John Ericsson.

The prize is awarded whenever the academy recognizes a significant achievement in either of the two fields. Awardees receive a gold-and-silver medal. Previous prizewinners include Thomas Alva Edison, for his investigations in electric lighting; Enrico Fermi, for his studies of radiation theory and nuclear energy; and Charles H. Townes, for his development of the laser. One man, Samuel Pierpont Langley, has won both the Rumford Prize and the related Rumford Medal (the European equivalent of the Rumford Prize), both in 1886. The most recent award was given in 2021 to Charles L. Bennett for his contributions to cosmology. The prize has been given to researchers outside of the United States only twice—once to John Stanley Plaskett, from British Columbia, and once to a group of Canadian scientists &quot;for their work in the field of long-baseline interferometry.&quot;

<text>Seyyed Hashem Aghajari (, born 1957) is an Iranian historian, university professor and a critic of the Islamic Republic&#x27;s government who was sentenced to death in 2002 for apostasy for a speech he gave on Islam urging Iranians to &quot;not blindly follow&quot; Islamic clerics. In 2004, after domestic Iranian and international outcry, his sentence was reduced to five years in prison.

==Overview==
Hashem Aghajari served in the Iran-Iraq War where he lost his right leg below the knee, and his brother. He has been described as having an &quot;impeccable Islamic revolutionary record.&quot;

He was a history professor at Tarbiat Modares University, a teacher-training college in Tehran. In June 2002, Aghajari gave an address in Hamadan commemorating the 25th anniversary of the death of Dr. Ali Shariati, criticized some of the present Islamic practices in Iran as being in contradiction with the original practices and ideology of Islam, and calling for &quot;Islamic Protestantism&quot; and reform in Islam. This prompted an &quot;immediate outcry&quot; from hardline clerics, who claimed that he was attacking &quot;the Prophet of Islam and fundamental Shiite Islamic traditions&quot;, although Dr. Aghajari has repeatedly denied that his speech was intended as an attack on Islam or the Prophet.

===Arrest, trial, sentence and imprisonment===
He was arrested 8 August. The trial was criticized not only for its harshness but for falling &quot;far short of international standards of due process,&quot; being &quot;conducted behind closed doors&quot;, and giving the defendant &quot;only limited access to his lawyer.&quot; According to the conservative newspaper Jumhuri Eslami, the Supreme Leader&#x27;s order was (at first) &quot;flagrantly&quot; ignored by prosecutor general Abdolnabi Namazi. According to &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine, Supreme leader Khamenei ordered the judiciary to review Aghajari&#x27;s death sentence, but &quot;hardliners in the judiciary at first ignored&quot; his order &quot;then assigned their least lenient judges to the review.&quot;

Although other controversial death sentences have been reduced on appeal, Aghajari refused to appeal the ruling, announcing through his lawyer that &quot;those who have issued this verdict have to implement it if they think it is right or else the judiciary has to handle it.&quot; While in prison his family reported that Aghajari&#x27;s amputated leg stub was bruised and infected and that he was &quot;unable to stand up, walk or use the prison&#x27;s hygiene facilities.&quot; The human rights group, Amnesty International, campaigned against the sentence.

The death sentence was denounced by many. The Iranian parliament, President Mohammad Khatami, and Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri condemned it.

Demonstrations against the sentence began the day after it was made public on November 6. They are thought to have attracted no more than 5000 participants but nonetheless were &quot;the most serious protests in Iran since 1999&quot; and are thought to have provoked Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to order a review of the verdict and a threat to use &quot;popular forces&quot; (Basij) against the demonstrators.

The sentence was later commuted to three years in jail, two years in probation, and five years&#x27; suspension of his social rights by the Supreme Court of Iran. In May 2004 the original regional court reinstated the death sentence, but the next month Iran&#x27;s Supreme Court again reduced it.

He was released from prison July 31, 2004 after paying a bail of $122,500, according to the Associated Press.

He speaks out against the notion of the crime of apostasy during a seminar in 2008.

In 2014, he was again sentenced to one year in prison in charge of &quot;propaganda against the regime&quot;.

===Explanation===
According to Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a &quot;leading Iranian newspaper editor and confidant of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami&quot; interviewed by Newsweek magazine, the arrest and stiff sentence were an attempt to distract attention from two bills to increase the power of president and curb the hard-liner conservatives&#x27; supervisory power which reformist President Khatami had introduced into Parliament.

The failure of Iran&#x27;s Hezbollah paramilitaries to make &quot;a serious attempt to break up&quot; the peaceful reformist student protests over the sentence was thought to be associated with Supreme Leader Khamenei&#x27;s implicit criticism of the sentence and the &quot;impartiality&quot; of his failing to side with conservative hardliners.

<text>Macdonald River, a perennial river that is part of the Namoi catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the Northern Tablelands district of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==
The river rises east of Niangala on the western slopes of the Moonbi Range and the Great Dividing Range and generally flows north west after its confluence with its major tributary, the Cobrabald River, and flows through Warrabah National Park before reaching its mouth, with the Namoi River; dropping over its course of .

From source to mouth, the river passes through or near the villages of Woolbrook and Bendemeer.

==Recreation and development==

Trout fishing is possible in the waters of the Macdonald River, its creeks and tributaries upstream of the New England Highway road bridge at Bendemeer. The Namoi River snapping turtle or Bell&#x27;s turtle (&quot;Elseya belli&quot;) is a species of turtle found only in the upper reaches of the Namoi River, Gwydir River and Macdonald Rivers.

The T A Perry Bridge, that carries the New England Highway and crosses the Macdonald River, was completed in 1985, enabling a bypass of the village of Bendemeer.

In November 2008, torrential rain caused severe flooding in the Macdonald River and led to the area being declared a natural disaster area.

<text>Jean Alexandre Joseph Falguière (; also given as Jean-Joseph-Alexandre Falguière, or in short Alexandre Falguière) (7 September 183120 April 1900) was a French sculptor and painter.

==Biography==
Falguière was born in Toulouse. A pupil of the École des Beaux-Arts, he won the Prix de Rome in 1859; he was awarded the medal of honor at the Paris Salon in 1868 and was appointed Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1878.

Falguière&#x27;s first bronze statue of importance was &quot;Le Vainqueur au Combat de Coqs (Victor of the Cockfight)&quot; (1864), and &quot;Tarcisius the Christian Boy-Martyr&quot; followed in 1867; both were exhibited in the Luxembourg Museum and are now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. His more important monuments are those to Admiral Courbet (1890) at Abbeville and the famous Joan of Arc. Other works include &quot;Eve&quot; (1880), &quot;Diana&quot; (1882 and 1891), &quot;Woman and Peacock&quot; (a. k. a. &quot;Juno and The Peacock&quot;), and &quot;The Poet&quot;, astride his Pegasus spreading wings for flight. He sculpted &quot;The Dancer&quot;, based on Cléo de Mérode which today is also in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.
In 1870 he helped create the snow sculpture, &quot;La statue de la Résistance&quot;.

To these works should be added his monuments to Cardinal Lavigerie and to &quot;Marquis de Lafayette&quot; (in Washington, DC), and his statues of Alphonse de Lamartine (1876) and St Vincent de Paul (1879), as well as the &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, which he executed for the Société des gens de lettres on their rejection of that by Auguste Rodin; and the busts of Carolus-Duran and Ernest Alexandre Honoré Coquelin (1896).

Falguière was a painter as well as a sculptor. His &quot;Wrestlers&quot; (1875) and &quot;Fan and Dagger&quot; (1882; a defiant Spanish woman) were in the Luxembourg, and other pictures of importance are &quot;The Beheading of St John the Baptist&quot; (1877), &quot;The Sphinx&quot; (1883), &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; (1885), &quot;Old Woman and Child&quot; (1886) and &quot;In the Bull Slaughter-House&quot;.

Falguière also taught; among his students were Francis Edwin Elwell, Ernest Henri Dubois, Julien Caussé, Laurent Marqueste, Henri Crenier and Théophile Barrau.

Falguière became a member of the Institut de France (Académie des Beaux-Arts) in 1882.

Falguière died in Paris in 1900 and was interred there in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, where his monument is by his pupil Marqueste.

<doc id="846170" wikidata="Q14181442" url="?curid=846170" title="Gymkhana">
<text>Gymkhana () (, , , , ) is a British Raj term which originally referred to a place of assembly. The meaning then altered to denote a place where skill-based contests were held. &quot;Gymkhana&quot; is an Anglo-Indian expression, which is derived from the Persian word &quot;Jamat-khana&quot;. Most gymkhanas have a Gymkhana Club associated with them, a term coined during the British Raj for gentlemen&#x27;s club.

More generally, gymkhana refers to a social and sporting club in the Indian subcontinent, and in other Asian countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, and Singapore, as well as in East Africa.

==Etymology==

The first element of &quot;Gymkhana&quot; comes from &quot;gend&quot; meaning &quot;ball&quot; in Urdu/Hindi/Hindustani/Khariboli. This element is distinct from the English word &quot;gym&quot;, short for &quot;gymnasium&quot; and &quot;gymnastics&quot; which has Greek and Latin roots. The second element, &quot;khānā&quot; has a Persian origin, meaning a home or a compartment. In Persian, (خانه) is a term for &quot;dwelling, house&quot;. The court language of the Mughal Empire was Persian.

<doc id="846175" wikidata="Q3709266" url="?curid=846175" title="Dysbarism">
<text>Dysbarism or dysbaric disorders refers to medical conditions resulting from changes in ambient pressure. Various activities are associated with pressure changes. Underwater diving is the most frequently cited example, but pressure changes also affect people who work in other pressurized environments (for example, caisson workers), and people who move between different altitudes. A dysbaric disorder may be acute or chronic.

== Ambient pressure ==
Ambient pressure on a diver is the pressure in the water around the diver (or the air, with caisson workers etc.). It is the sum of the atmospheric pressure at the surface and hydrostatic pressure due to the depth. As a diver descends, the ambient pressure increases. At in seawater, it is twice the normal atmospheric pressure at the surface. At 40 meters (a common recommended limit for recreational diving) it is 5 times the pressure at sea level.

Pressure decreases with altitude above sea level, but less dramatically. At 3000 feet altitude (almost 1000 meters), the ambient pressure is almost 90% of sea level pressure. Ambient pressure does not drop to 50% of sea level pressure until 20,000 feet or 6,000 meters altitude.

== Effects of pressure on the body ==

=== Direct effects on tissues ===
This is not of practical importance, because the body is mostly composed of barely compressible materials such as water. People often wonder whether scuba divers feel their body being crushed by the pressure, but divers would have to reach depths of thousands of feet before their flesh began to suffer significant compression.

=== Gas filled spaces ===
Gas is very compressible. Humans have many air spaces: sinuses, middle ears, gas in the gastro-intestinal tract, cavities in the teeth, and largest of all, the lungs. On land in dail life, the pressure in these air spaces is usually exactly the same as the pressure outside, because the air spaces are connected to the outside world. If there is a pressure difference between the outside world and one of these air spaces, the air space will change volume as much as the surrounding tissues allow, after which the wall will be stretched painfully and may rupture.

=== Dissolved gas ===
A percentage of the gas we breathe (air) is always dissolved in our blood, like the gas dissolved in a carbonated drink bottle with the lid on. If a person moves to a higher ambient pressure, then the gas inhaled is at a higher pressure, so more of it dissolves in the blood and diffuses into body tissues (Henry&#x27;s and Fick&#x27;s gas laws). If they slowly move back to a lower pressure, then the extra gas comes out slowly until they are back to their normal amount of dissolved gas. But if they move quickly to a lower ambient pressure, then the gas comes out of our blood and tissues violently, in large bubbles, in the same way that quickly removing the cap from a bottle of soft drink produces far more bubbles than slowly opening the bottle.

== Types of dysbarism ==
Different types of illness result from increases in pressure (for example, descent during an underwater dive, descent during a plane flight), versus decreases in pressure (for example, coming up from a caisson, or ascending a mountain). Dysbarism comprises several types of illness:

=== Decompression sickness (DCS) ===

Decompression sickness, also called caisson workers&#x27; disease and the bends, is the most well-known complication of scuba diving. It occurs as divers ascend, and often from ascending too fast or without doing decompression stops. Bubbles are large enough and numerous enough to cause physical injury. It is quite possible that all divers have microbubbles in their blood to some extent, but that most of the time these bubbles are so few and so small that they cause no harm. When DCS occurs, bubbles disrupt tissues in the joints, brain, spinal cord, lungs, and other organs. Symptoms vary enormously. DCS may be as subtle as unusual tiredness after a dive, or an aching elbow, or a mottled skin rash. Or, it may present dramatically, with unconsciousness, seizures, paralysis, shortness of breath, or death. Paraplegia is possible.

=== Nitrogen narcosis ===

Nitrogen narcosis is also called “L’ivresse des grandes profondeurs” or &quot;rapture of the deep&quot;. Nitrogen constitutes 78% of dry air, but at surface pressures it has no sedating effect. At greater depths, however, nitrogen affects the brain in the same way as nitrous oxide (also known as laughing gas) and other anaesthetic gases. The effect is similar to the effects of alcohol, and to some extent there is cross-tolerance. Unlike alcohol, the onset and disappearance are near instantaneous. A diver may be quite clear-headed at 20 meters, and yet giddy and silly at 30 meters. Ascending to 20 meters will almost instantly clear the head.

=== High-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) ===

High-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) – also known as high-pressure neurological syndrome, and helium tremors, is a neurological and physiological diving disorder which can result when a diver descends below about using a breathing gas containing a high proportion of helium. The effects experienced, and the severity of those effects, depend on the rate of descent, the depth and the percentage of helium. Symptoms of HPNS include tremors, myoclonic jerking, somnolence, EEG changes, visual disturbance, nausea, dizziness, and decreased mental performance.

=== Barotrauma ===

Barotrauma is injury caused by pressure effects on gas spaces. This may occur during ascent or descent. The ears are the most commonly affected body part. The most serious injury is lung barotrauma, which can result in pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, subcutaneous emphysema, and arterial gas embolism. All divers, commercial air travelers, people traveling overland between different altitudes, and people who work in pressurized environments have had to deal with some degree of barotrauma effect upon their ears, sinuses, and other air spaces. At the most extreme, barotrauma can cause ruptured eardrums, bleeding sinuses, exploding tooth cavities, and the lung injuries described above. This is the reason why divers follow a procedure of not holding their breath during ascent. By breathing continuously, they keep the airways open and avoid pressure differences between their lungs and ambient pressure.

==== Arterial gas embolism (AGE) ====

Arterial gas embolism (AGE) is a complication of lung barotrauma of ascent. It occurs when breathing gas is introduced to the circulation on the arterial side via lung over-pressure trauma. AGE can present in similar ways to arterial blockages seen in other medical situations. Affected people may suffer strokes, with paralysis or numbness down one side; they may suffer heart attacks; they may suffer pulmonary embolism with shortness of breath and chest pain. It is often impossible to distinguish AGE from DCS, but luckily it is rarely necessary for physicians to be able to distinguish between the two, as treatment is the same. Sometimes AGE and DCS are lumped into a single entity, Decompression Illness (DCI). This problem does not normally occur on breathhold dives as the gas in the lungs will return to the volume it had at the start of the dive, and not expand further.

=== Classification ===
In addition to the foregoing, dysbarism is sometimes classified according to the source of the excess gas, with &quot;trapped gas&quot; dysbarism referring to the expansion of pockets that were already in a gaseous state in the body, and &quot;evolved gas&quot; dysbarism referring to gasses (primarily nitrogen or helium) dissolved in the body coming out of solution to form gas bubbles.

==Compression arthralgia==

Compression arthralgia is pain in the joints caused by exposure to high ambient pressure at a relatively high rate of compression, experienced by underwater divers. Also referred to in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual as compression pains.

Compression arthralgia has been recorded as deep aching pain in the knees, shoulders, fingers, back, hips, neck and ribs. Pain may be sudden and intense in onset and may be accompanied by a feeling of roughness in the joints.

Onset commonly occurs around 60 msw (meters of sea water), and symptoms are variable depending on depth, compression rate and personal susceptibility. Intensity increases with depth and may be aggravated by exercise. Compression arthralgia is generally a problem of deep diving, particularly deep saturation diving, where at sufficient depth even slow compression may produce symptoms. Peter B. Bennett et al. (1974) found that the use of trimix could reduce the symptoms.

<text>The Gallatin School of Individualized Study (commonly referred to as Gallatin) is a liberal arts school within New York University. Students at Gallatin design an interdisciplinary concentration based on their specific interests and career goals. Most courses can be taken at any of the schools within New York University, in addition to Gallatin&#x27;s course offerings.

==History==

The school was founded in 1972 as the University Without Walls. In 1976, the school was renamed the Gallatin Division for Albert Gallatin (secretary of the treasury under Thomas Jefferson and the founder of New York University). In 1995 the school took the name, Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

Herbert London was the school&#x27;s first dean through 1992. The Gallatin building is situated within the campus of New York University just east of Washington Square Park, at 1 Washington Place in Manhattan, New York City.

The Gallatin School&#x27;s facilities on the corner of Washington Place and Broadway underwent a redesign in 2007–2008. It was the first renovation project at New York University to achieve LEED certification. The project earned a LEED Gold certification for renovating five floors (approximately 32,000 square feet) of the existing building, including the construction of a theater, art gallery, classrooms, studios, and offices. The main building is named after Georgina Bloomberg.

==Academics==

Gallatin students develop a concentration, as opposed to a major, that is individualized to suit their interests and goals. A concentration can encompass multiple areas of study and often involves taking courses in various schools within New York University. There are, however, general requirements for graduation. These start with foundation courses (a first year writing seminar, a first year research seminar, and multiple interdisciplinary seminars) and end with an intensive oral discourse called the &quot;colloquium&quot; which is held during a student&#x27;s final semester.

==Early life and career==
Lavin was born in Portland, Maine, the younger daughter of David Joseph Lavin, a businessman, and Lucille Dorothy (&quot;née&quot; Potter), an opera singer. The Lavin family were active members of the local Jewish community. Both sets of grandparents emigrated from Russia. Her family was musically talented, and Lavin was on stage from the age of five. She attended Waynflete School and Deering High School before enrolling in the College of William &amp; Mary. In the summer of 1958, she played one of the leads in &quot;The Common Glory&quot;, an outdoor drama written by Paul Green and staged at an amphitheater on campus. Upon her graduation from William and Mary, she had already received her Actors&#x27; Equity Association card. She was a member of the Compass Players in the late 1950s. She studied acting at HB Studio in New York City. By the early 1960s, Lavin had appeared in several Broadway shows and appeared on the 1966 cast recordings of &quot;The Mad Show&quot; performing Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;The Boy From...&quot;. From &quot;It&#x27;s a Bird...It&#x27;s a Plane...It&#x27;s Superman&quot;, one of her numbers, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Possibilities&quot;, was the album&#x27;s best-received song and was called &quot;The one memorable song...flirty, syncopated&quot; by the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot;.

==Career==
===Television and film===
In 1967, Lavin made an appearance as Gloria Thorpe in a television version of the baseball musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; with Phil Silvers. In 1969, Lavin married actor Ron Leibman, and by 1973, the couple had moved to Hollywood, California. After various guest appearances on episodic television series such as &quot;The Nurses&quot;, &quot;Rhoda&quot;, &quot;Harry O&quot;, and &quot;Kaz&quot;, Lavin landed a recurring role as Detective Janice Wentworth on &quot;Barney Miller&quot; during the first and second seasons (1975–1976).
She left &quot;Barney Miller&quot; to star in the lead role in &quot;Alice&quot;, which was a sitcom success that ran from 1976 to 1985 on the CBS network. The series was based on the Martin Scorsese–directed Ellen Burstyn film &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. Lavin portrayed Alice Hyatt, a waitress and singer, the character that Burstyn had played. Lavin performed the series&#x27; theme song, &quot;There&#x27;s a New Girl in Town,&quot; which was written by David Shire and Alan and Marilyn Bergman and was updated for each of the first six seasons. During the series&#x27; nine-season run, Lavin won two Golden Globe Awards and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, and gained experience directing, especially during the later seasons. Lavin also played a dual role in &quot;Alice&quot;, as Debbie Walden, the wizened and former landlady of the character Vera Louise Gorman-Novak. Lavin also made numerous television appearances outside of &quot;Alice&quot;, including hosting her own holiday special for CBS, &quot;Linda in Wonderland&quot; (1980). She acted in two sitcoms, &quot;Room for Two&quot; (1992–93) and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Conrad Bloom&quot;. In &quot;Room for Two&quot;, she played a mother who moved in with her daughter, played by Patricia Heaton, who has a show on a local television station. The daughter gives Lavin&#x27;s character her own segment, called &quot;Just a Thought&quot;, at the end of her program.

She made numerous television guest appearances, including roles on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1979), &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; (1999), and HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (2002).

She also appeared in many telefilms between 1967 and 1998, including: &quot;Damn Yankees!&quot;, &quot;Sadbird&quot;, &quot;The Morning After&quot;, &quot;Jerry&quot;, &quot;Like Mom, Like Me&quot;, &quot;The $5.20 an Hour Dream&quot;, &quot;Another Woman&#x27;s Child&quot;, &quot;Maricela&quot;, &quot;Lena: My 100 Children&quot;, &quot;Whitewash&quot;, &quot;A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story&quot;, &quot;Stolen Memories: Secrets from the Rose Garden&quot;, &quot;For the Future: The Irvine Fertility Scandal&quot;, &quot;The Ring&quot;, and &quot;Best Friends for Life&quot;. Lavin produced and starred in &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;, the 1981 telefilm based on the work of nurse thanatologist Joy Ufema. She directed the 1990 telefilm &quot;Flour Babies&quot;.

Lavin made her feature film debut in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984). Her other feature film appearances include &quot;See You in the Morning&quot;, starring Jeff Bridges; Alain Resnais&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Go Home&quot;, opposite Gérard Depardieu (both 1989); and &quot;The Back-up Plan&quot; (2010).

Lavin also provided the voice of the Mother Vulture in the animated series &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; for the episode &quot;Watch The Birdies&quot;. 

After working in theater for many years, Lavin was cast in the NBC television sitcom &quot;Sean Saves the World&quot; (2013–14) playing Sean Hayes&#x27; pushy, meddling mother Lorna. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interviewer noted: &quot;A highlight of the show is the wonderful chemistry between Lavin and Hayes, who exchange repartee and quips with breezy ease. And the cast seems smitten with her.&quot;

In 2015, Lavin guest starred as a judge approached to stop an execution in the episode of &quot;Bones&quot; titled &quot;The Verdict in the Victims&quot;. Actress Emily Deschanel said &quot;Lavin was particularly fun to have on&quot; the show.

Lavin played Judy Roberts in the CBS sitcom &quot;9JKL&quot; (2017–18) alongside Mark Feuerstein and Elliott Gould. Lavin caught up with &quot;Portland Magazine&quot; in its Winterguide 2018 issue about her return to CBS stating: 

In 2019, Lavin joined the cast of the Netflix comedy/horror &quot;Santa Clarita Diet&quot;, starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant.

In 2020, Lavin performed the song &quot;The Boy From...&quot; from &quot;The Mad Show&quot; in &quot;Take Me to the World: A Sondheim 90th Birthday Celebration.&quot; Lavin appeared in the CBS comedy &quot;B Positive&quot;, which aired from 2020 to 2022, in a recurring role as Norma, one of the senior citizens at a local retirement home.

In June 2024, it was announced that Max Mutchnick and David Kohan had created a &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;–like TV series with Matt Bomer cast as a Betty White character type and Nathan Lane as Bunny Schneiderman, a Bea Arthur character type. Lavin was set to play Lane&#x27;s mother, Sybil Schneiderman. The series has been picked up by the Hulu streaming network and is set in Palm Springs with the title &quot;Mid-Century Modern&quot;. At the time of her death, seven of ten episodes of the series had been filmed, and Lavin&#x27;s character was subsequently written out of the series in the episode &quot;Here&#x27;s To You Mrs. Schneiderman.&quot;

===Theater===
In 1960 Lavin appeared at the East 74th Street Theater in George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot;, with Penny Fuller and Marti Stevens.

Lavin began her career with Broadway appearances in the musical &quot;A Family Affair&quot; (1962) and plays such as &quot;The Riot Act&quot; (1963) and Carl Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Something Different&quot; (1967). In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review of John Guare&#x27;s two one-act plays, &quot;Cop-Out&quot; (1969), Clive Barnes wrote: &quot;Miss Lavin...carries versatility almost to the point of paranoia, and camps up a storm.&quot;

Lavin also appeared in numerous Off-Broadway productions, including the revue &quot;Wet Paint&quot; (1965), the musical &quot;The Mad Show&quot; (1966) (in which she introduced the cabaret standard &quot;The Boy From...&quot;, written by Stephen Sondheim and Mary Rodgers), and &quot;Little Murders&quot; (1969). Lavin won the Theatre World Award for &quot;Wet Paint&quot; and a Drama Desk Award for &quot;Little Murders&quot;. In 1975, she appeared in the Shakespeare in the Park production of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; at the Delacorte Theater.

She &quot;arrived at showbiz stardom with a featured role&quot; in the musical &quot;It&#x27;s a Bird...It&#x27;s a Plane...It&#x27;s Superman&quot; (1966). She received her first Tony Award nomination in 1970, for her role in the Neil Simon play &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; (1969). Clive Barnes, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;Linda Lavin, eyebrows, [sic] flaunting like telegraphed messages, mouth twitching and pouting, voice as dry as thunder and with a cough like electric static, is beautiful as Elaine, the sex cat feeling coolly kittenish and looking for a safe tin roof.&quot; Lavin&#x27;s last Broadway credit before she moved to Hollywood was in &quot;Paul Sills&#x27; Story Theatre&quot; in 1971.

In 1984, Lavin played the character of &quot;The Mother&quot; in Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; in a production directed by Robert Brustein at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

After more than a decade away, Lavin returned to the Broadway stage in 1987, winning a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play and her second Drama Desk Award for her role as Kate in Simon&#x27;s play &quot;Broadway Bound&quot;. In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank Rich wrote: &quot;One only wishes that Ms. Lavin, whose touching performance is of the same high integrity as the writing, could stay in the role forever.&quot; Theatre critic Charles McNulty wrote of her performance that it &quot;is widely considered one of the most memorable in contemporary Broadway history, winning not just awards but praise approaching the level of myth. The theater critic Gordon Rogoff, extolling &#x27;the power available only to an actor at the height of her own command of detail,&#x27; went so far as to describe Lavin&#x27;s portrayal as &#x27;one of those textbook lessons in great acting...&#x27; &quot;

She then starred on Broadway in &quot;Gypsy&quot; as Mama Rose Hovick, replacing Tyne Daly in July 1990. June Havoc saw Lavin&#x27;s performance in &quot;Gypsy&quot; and sent Lavin a photo of Havoc&#x27;s mother, the real Rose Hovick, with a note of appreciation for Lavin&#x27;s portrayal of the character.

Her subsequent Broadway roles included &quot;The Sisters Rosensweig&quot;, as a replacement Gorgeous Teitelbaum starting in September 1993 and Mrs. Van Daan in &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1997–1998), opposite Natalie Portman, for which she garnered a Tony nomination as Featured Actress in a Play. In 1995 she appeared in the Off-Broadway &quot;Death-Defying Acts&quot;, which consists of three one-act plays; Lavin performed in the Elaine May (&quot;Hotline&quot;) and Woody Allen plays (&quot;Central Park West&quot;). She was nominated for a Drama Desk Award (Outstanding Actress – Play) and won an Obie Award (Performance) and the Lucille Lortel Award. She also directed theater during this period.

She played Marjorie in &quot;The Tale of the Allergist&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2000–2001), co-starring Tony Roberts and Michele Lee, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award, Leading Actress in a Play, and Drama Desk Award, and &quot;nanny&quot; for Helen (young Carol Burnett, played by Sara Niemietz and Donna Lynne Champlin) in &quot;Hollywood Arms&quot; in Chicago and on Broadway in 2002.

In 2010, Lavin appeared as Ruth Steiner in a Broadway revival of the play &quot;Collected Stories&quot; opposite Sarah Paulson as her student, reprising her role for a PBS production of the play, and received a fifth Tony nomination for the role. She appeared in the new play by Jon Robin Baitz, &quot;Other Desert Cities&quot;, Off-Broadway at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater (now the Vivian Beaumont Theater) at Lincoln Center, beginning in previews in December 2010, closing February 27, 2011. Lavin was featured in the Kennedy Center (Washington, DC) production of the musical &quot;Follies&quot;, from May 2011 to June 2011, as Hattie Walker.

She appeared in the premiere of the Nicky Silver play &quot;The Lyons&quot; at the Off-Broadway Vineyard Theatre, beginning in September 2011, through November 11. Ben Brantley, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer, commented: &quot;Watching Ms. Lavin, I found myself thinking of Nora from Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Doll&#x27;s House&quot; – well, a pursed-lipped, lemony-sour, older Nora in pseudo-Chanel, one who&#x27;s never at a loss for what to say and when to say it. Rita may be a little behind schedule in discovering herself, but no one can fault the hair-trigger timing of the actress playing her or the surprising dimensions she finds within one-liners.&quot; She reprised her role in the Broadway production, which opened at the Cort Theatre on April 23, 2012, and closed on July 1, 2012.

Lavin appeared in the new Nicky Silver play &quot;Too Much Sun&quot;, which opened Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre on May 18, 2014. Ben Brantley, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;And it&#x27;s an unconditional treat to witness an actress like Ms. Lavin tuned so precisely into the writer&#x27;s wavelength that script and performance become a marriage of true minds.&quot;

Lavin appeared in 2015/16 on Broadway at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre in a Manhattan Theatre Club production of Richard Greenberg&#x27;s &quot;Our Mother&#x27;s Brief Affair&quot;.

In January 2017, Lavin appeared in New York City Opera&#x27;s production of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; at the Rose Theatre at Lincoln Center in the role of The Old Lady.

In 2020, Lavin performed &quot;The Boy From...&quot; as part of &quot;Take Me to the World: A Sondheim 90th Birthday Celebration&quot;. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Ben Brantley called her performance of the song &quot;deliciously undersold,&quot; and noted that she had introduced it 54 years earlier.

===Cabaret and recording===
Lavin appeared in cabaret and concert performances. In 2005 she appeared at the Empire Plush Room in San Francisco, accompanied by Billy Stritch and her husband, Steve Bakunas. The &quot;Talkin&#x27; Broadway&quot; reviewer summed up her performance: &quot;Linda Lavin is funny, warm and full of personality.&quot; In April 2006 she performed at Birdland (New York) &quot;with her critically acclaimed cabaret act The Song Remembers When&quot;, with Billy Stritch. She performed with the Wilmington Symphony (Wilmington, North Carolina) in March 2012.

Her recording &quot;Possibilities&quot; was released by Ghostlight Records in 2012. Steven Suskin wrote: &quot;There is still that sweet, friendly sound of long ago (and &#x27;sweet&#x27; and &#x27;friendly&#x27; are not words you&#x27;d use to describe Lavin-the-actress).&quot;

==Personal life==

Lavin was married three times. Her first marriage to Ron Leibman ended in divorce in 1981. Her second marriage, to Kip Niven, whom she met on the set of &quot;Alice&quot;, ended in a bitter divorce in 1992. While Lavin had no biological children, she was the stepmother of the children of her second husband. She married Steve Bakunas in 2005. The couple resided in Wilmington, North Carolina, where they were committed community members who were working together to rehabilitate impoverished neighborhoods including renovating many homes, donating a park to the city and creating a community theater, the Red Barn Studio. In 1997, Lavin founded The Linda Lavin Arts Foundation in Wilmington, &quot;to promote and foster the advancement of the performing and visual arts, with special emphasis on arts in education. Her foundation has created a theater program called Girl Friends, whose purpose is to raise the self-esteem of at-risk teenage girls of the inner city.&quot;

In Wilmington, she was a stage director. One of her directorial credits was a 1998 production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;, updated to a Brazilian jazz style. In both Wilmington and New York she taught master classes in acting and singing.

In September 2012, Lavin announced that she intended to sell her home in Wilmington and return to New York City. Lavin and Bakunas lived in New York City from circa 2013–2014 on.

===Death===
Lavin died from complications from lung cancer in Los Angeles, on December 29, 2024, at the age of 87.

<text>John Smeallie Youngs (born August 25, 1949), known professionally as John Savage, is an American actor. He first rose to prominence in the late 1970s for his portrayals of troubled-but-sensitive characters in films like &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), &quot;The Onion Field&quot; (1979) and &quot;Hair&quot; (1979). His television roles include Donald Lydecker on &quot;Dark Angel&quot; (2000–2002) and Hack Scudder on &quot;Carnivàle&quot; (2003–2005).

== Early life ==
John Smeallie Youngs was born in Old Bethpage on Long Island, New York on August 25, 1949, to Floyd and Muriel Youngs. Savage&#x27;s younger siblings, Gail (b. 1952) and Jim Youngs (b. 1956), are also actors. His younger sister, Robin Young, is a Peabody Award-winning journalist and news broadcaster.

After graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Savage worked for the Manhattan&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Theatre Group.

==Career==
Savage has appeared in more than 200 feature films, short films, recurring roles in television series and guest appearances in episodes of television series. One of Savage&#x27;s first notable roles is as Claude Hooper Bukowski in the 1979 film &quot;Hair&quot;. His first major film role was as Steven Pushkov in the multiple Oscar-winning 1978 film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. He also had a lead role in the 1979 film &quot;The Onion Field&quot;.
In the late 1970s, he performed in the Broadway production of David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;American Buffalo&quot;.

In 1991, he starred in Italian director Lucio Fulci&#x27;s final film &quot;Door to Silence&quot;. He then had a brief role in the 1998 war film &quot;The Thin Red Line,&quot; portrayed Captain Ransom in the two part episode &quot;Equinox&quot; of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in 1999, and appeared in the recurring role of Donald Lydecker in the first and second seasons of the 2000 television series &quot;Dark Angel.&quot;

Savage appeared in the recurring role of Henry Scudder in the HBO television series &quot;Carnivàle&quot; between 2003 and 2005. He appeared in unrelated roles in two of the series in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise: the 2004 &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Conscience&quot; as a man who put his wife in a permanent coma, and the 2005 &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Quarry&quot; as a child molester on death row for murdering one of his victims.

Savage appeared in the 2015 horror film &quot;Tales of Halloween,&quot; the 2017 film &quot;In Dubious Battle,&quot; and on the 2017 continuation of the television show &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot;

In 2017, Savage spoke at a tribute honoring director Richard Donner, held by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
In 2018, he appeared on the television show &quot;Goliath&quot;. In the same year, Savage lent his voice to a monologue on the title track of the album &quot;This Town&quot; by Steve Smith of Dirty Vegas.

== Personal life ==
Savage has two children with his first wife, Susan (divorced 1969), including actress Jennifer Youngs (b. 1969). He was married to South African actress Sandi Schultz between 1993 and 2002.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Savage was an anti-apartheid activist in South Africa, and became acquainted with Nelson Mandela. He helped secure Mandela&#x27;s involvement in the 1992 film &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, directed by Spike Lee, on which he was the assistant production manager for the South Africa unit.

Savage&#x27;s former brother-in-law was actor Robert Duvall, who was married to his sister Gail Youngs, from 1982 to 1986.

<text>Violette Muriel Box, Baroness Gardiner, (22 September 1905 – 18 May 1991) was an English screenwriter and director, Britain&#x27;s most prolific female director, having directed 12 feature films and one featurette. Her screenplay for &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot; (co-written with husband Sydney Box) won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

==Early life ==
Violette Muriel Baker was born in Simla, Poplar Grove, New Malden, Surrey, on 22 September 1905. She was the third child of Caroline Beatrice (&quot;née&quot; Doney) (1872–1961) and Charles Stephen Baker (&quot;d&quot;. 1945). Her mother had been a pupil teacher, a maid, and an assistant in a magic lantern shop. Her father worked as a clerk for the South Western Railway at Waterloo. Her family called young Muriel &quot;Tiggy&quot;. She attended St Matthew&#x27;s School, Tolworth, for her primary school years moving up to Holy Cross Convent in Wimbledon in 1915, but was expelled, mostly as she had not been baptised. She then transferred to Surbiton High School. Here she took ballet lessons and studied drama with Sir Ben Greet. In the 1920s, she met Joseph Grossman of Stoll Pictures which led to work as an extra in &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; and in the thriller series &quot;The Old Man in the Corner&quot;.

In 1929, Baker left a typing job at Barcley Corsets in Welwyn Garden City, for the scenario department of British Instructional Pictures. As talkies were introduced, Barker was given the task of reading unsolicited manuscripts which led to her developing story writing and dialogue skills. She landed a job as continuity clerk on Anthony Asquith&#x27;s &quot;Tell England&quot; (1931). She moved to British International Pictures at Elstree, where she worked on Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Number Seventeen&quot; (1932).

== Career ==
In 1935, she met and married journalist Sydney Box, with whom she collaborated on nearly forty plays with mainly female roles for amateur theatre groups. Their production company, Verity Films, first released short wartime propaganda films, including &quot;The English Inn&quot; (1941), her first directing effort, after which it branched into fiction. The couple achieved their greatest joint success with &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot; (1945) for which they gained the Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Screenplay in the following year.

After the war, the Rank Organisation hired her husband to head Gainsborough Pictures, where she was in charge of the scenario department, writing scripts for a number of light comedies, including two for child star Petula Clark, &quot;Easy Money&quot; and &quot;Here Come the Huggetts&quot; (both 1948). Muriel Box occasionally assisted as a dialogue director, or re-shot scenes during post-production. Her extensive work on &quot;The Lost People&quot; (1949) gained her a credit as co-director, her first for a full-length feature. In 1951, her husband created London Independent Producers, allowing Box more opportunities to direct. Many of her early films were adaptations of plays, and as such felt stage-bound. They were noteworthy more for their strong performances than they were for a distinctive directorial style. She favoured scripts with topical and frequently controversial themes, including Irish politics, teenage sex, abortion, illegitimacy and syphilis — consequently, several of her films were banned by local authorities.

She pursued her favourite subject – the female experience – in a number of films, including &quot;Street Corner&quot; (1953) about women police officers, Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Beachcomber&quot; (1954), with Donald Sinden and Glynis Johns as a resourceful missionary, again working with Donald Sinden on &quot;Eyewitness&quot; (1956) and a series of comedies about the battle of the sexes, including &quot;The Passionate Stranger&quot; (1957), &quot;The Truth About Women&quot; (1958) and her final film, &quot;Rattle of a Simple Man&quot; (1964).

Box often experienced prejudice in a male-dominated industry, especially hurtful when perpetrated by another woman. Jean Simmons had her replaced on &quot;So Long at the Fair&quot; (1950), and Kay Kendall unsuccessfully attempted to do the same with &quot;Simon and Laura&quot; (1955). Many producers questioned her competence to direct large-scale feature films, and while the press was quick to note her position as one of very few women directors in the British film industry, their tone tended to be condescending rather than filled with praise.

==Later years==
Muriel Box left film-making to write novels and created a successful publishing house, Femina, which proved to be a rewarding outlet for her feminism. She published her memoirs, &quot;Odd Woman Out&quot;, in 1974, and published &quot;Rebel Advocate&quot;, a biography of her second husband, Gerald Gardiner, in 1983.

==Personal life==
She married Sydney Box in 1935 and gave birth to a daughter, Leonora the following year. They divorced in 1969. Her sister-in-law Betty Box was Head of Production at the Gainsborough Pictures studio in Poole Street, Hoxton, and her brother-in-law through Betty was Peter Rogers, producer of the &quot;Carry On&quot; series of British comedy films. In 1970, she married Gerald Austin Gardiner, who had been Lord Chancellor, who died in 1990. She died in Mote End, Nan Clark&#x27;s Lane, Mill Hill, Hendon, Barnet, London on 18 May 1991, aged 85.

=== Daughter ===
Leonora went on to study at the Royal Academy from 30 September 1957 until December 1960, exhibiting at both the 1959 and 1960 Royal Academy of Arts Exhibitions, while living at Pond Cottage, Nan-Clark&#x27;s Lane, Mill Hill NW7.

<doc id="846196" wikidata="Q48514" url="?curid=846196" title="Sesshū Tōyō">
<text>, also known simply as , was a Japanese Zen monk and painter who is considered a great master of Japanese ink painting. Initially inspired by Chinese landscapes, Sesshū&#x27;s work holds a distinctively Japanese style that reflects Zen Buddhist aesthetics. His prominent work captured images of landscapes, portraits, and birds and flowers paintings, infused with Zen Buddhist beliefs, flattened perspective, and emphatic lines.

Sesshū was born into the samurai and trained at Shōkoku-ji temple in Kyoto, Japan, as a Zen monk. From his early childhood, Sesshū showed a talent for painting and eventually became widely revered throughout Japan as a wise, reputable Zen scholar, and the greatest painter priest of Zen-Shu.

Sesshū worked in a painting atelier whilst training under Tenshō Shūbun (c. 1418–1463). But upon visiting China, his work took on a distinctive Chinese influence, merging Japanese and Chinese styles to develop his individualistic style of Zen paintings. Sesshū&#x27;s influence on painting was so wide that many schools of art appointed him their founder. Sesshū&#x27;s most acclaimed works are &quot;Winter Landscape&quot; (c. 1470s), &quot;Birds and Flowers&quot; (1420–1506) and &quot;Four Landscape Scrolls of the Seasons&quot; (1420–1506).

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Sesshū Tōyō was born in Akahama (now Sōja City), a settlement in Bitchū Province, which is now a part of the Okayama Prefecture, during the Muromachi period. As a child, Sesshū entered the Buddhist community at the Hofukuji temple in Okayama, Japan. Little is known about Sesshū&#x27;s early life, but there is a well-known tale that, whilst at Hofukuji Temple, Sesshū&#x27;s instructor was forced to discipline him by tying him to a temple post. After a few hours passed, Sesshū used his tears as ink to draw a mouse on the wooden floor. The mouse was so realistic that it sprung to life and gnawed at the tight ropes to set him free.

At the age of twelve or thirteen years old, Sesshū entered the Shōkoku-ji temple in Kyoto, Japan, as an acolyte under the head priest of all zen temples, Shunrin Shuto, and eventually became a zen monk. Shōkoku-ji temple held a close relationship with the Muromachi government as the temple&#x27;s main supporters were a part of the ruling Ashikaga family. Whilst at Shōkoku-ji temple, Sesshū was a pupil of Tenshō Shūbun, who was often regarded as Japan&#x27;s first great master of ink landscape painting. Sesshū worked under Shūbun for 20 years before leaving Kyoto for a small provincial zen temple in western Japan. Here, he was left free from monastic and political duties to focus on painting.

=== China ===

Funded by a wealthy warrior clan that engaged in trade with China, then ruled by the Ming Dynasty, Sesshū travelled to China in 1467 as a member of a Japanese envoy. He travelled to China for three years, exploring the Chan monasteries, landscapes, and studied professional artists&#x27; Chinese paintings, rather than those by literati masters. Here, Sesshū had the opportunity to study traditional Chinese master paintings, learning about their realistic styles. During his travels from Ningbo to Peking, Sesshū felt the vastness of nature, learning from the original references used in Chinese ink painting. This influenced his following work greatly since, before visiting China, Sesshū worked under Shūbun&#x27;s style. Following Sesshū&#x27;s three years in China, his familiarity with Chinese landscapes showed in succeeding works as they held a distinct Chinese influence with his developing individualistic style.

=== Return to Japan and death ===
In the last years of Sesshū&#x27;s life, he visited Masuda, Japan, to study zen whilst painting and creating spiritual gardens called &quot;Sesshū&#x27;s gardens.&quot; In 1506, at 87 years old, Sesshū died at Tokoji temple, but his remains were taken to Ikoji temple, subsequently known as Sesshū temple, where they were cremated. Following Sesshū&#x27;s death, his pupil, Shutoku, inherited his studio, Unkoku-an.

==Paintings and techniques==
Sesshū&#x27;s works are predominantly suibokuga, meaning &quot;water and ink paintings&quot;. For suibokuga artists, the exclusivity of black ink allowed them to focus on the essential character of the subject since Zen Buddhism stresses material simplicity and sensitivity to the natural world. To create his monochrome paintings in diluted greys and black ink, Sesshū used black sumi, meaning charcoal or soot-based solid ink on paper or silk, thus following the art of sumi-e Some of Sesshū&#x27;s most acclaimed works include &quot;Winter Landscape&quot; (c. 1470s), &quot;Four Landscape Scrolls of the Seasons&quot; (c. 1420 – 1506) and, &quot;Birds and Flowers&quot; (c. 1420 – 1506), demonstrating his style of flattened space, emphatic outlines, and angular brushstrokes to portray zen beliefs.
=== &quot;Winter Landscape&quot; (c. 1470s) ===
Following his sojourn in China, Sesshū painted &quot;Winter Landscape&quot; (c. 1470s) in Japan&#x27;s rural provinces, demonstrating how Sesshū combined his artistic techniques and zen concepts. Sesshū solely used black sumi ink diluted to shades of grey. Flat, overlapping mountains depict the snowy landscape. Through short, expressive brushstrokes, Sesshū depicts a male figure trekking up a steeped pathway to a barren temple complex, suggesting the arduousness of his journey during the peak of winter. Common to Sesshū&#x27;s paintings, the single figure is surrounded by a towering landscape that draws on the concept of mono no aware, humankind being present with nature, to create a secluding atmosphere. Throughout the composition, Sesshū uses the shumpo technique, varying the firmness and thickness of outlines to depict three-dimensionality and textures. This modelling is enhanced by the diluted ink washes and rendering using fine lines. In the foreground, the rocks and trees show weighted, dark lines whilst the left distant mountains are outlined against the grey sky with a single brushstroke to capture the moment. The intensity of Sesshū’s work is shown by the sharp, angular brushstrokes in the centre, reflecting Zen Buddhism&#x27;s influence. Similarly, he uses ink wash for the rolling mist to divide the space between solid and void, mirroring the Taoist metaphysical concept of tension between subjects. This is heightened by the sharp diagonals of the opposing foreground rocks as they bring a sense of inescapable, pent up energy. The background features a single, strong, lightning-like brushstroke that outlines the central cliffs as the tip vanishes into the mist, suggesting transitory moments in time, as believed in Zen Buddhism. Overall, &quot;Winter Landscape&quot; represents Sesshū&#x27;s stylistic choices and implementation of Zen Buddhist concepts, notably drawing on Chinese landscapes that symbolised a virtuous man’s dedication to remaining honourable during strenuous moments.

=== &quot;Four Landscape Scrolls of the Seasons&quot; (c. 1420–1506) ===
Painted at 67 years old, Sesshū Tōyō&#x27;s &quot;Four Landscape Scrolls of the Seasons&quot; (c. 1420–1506) depicts the flow of the four seasons whilst reflecting on his experiences with Japanese and Chinese landscapes. Each scroll is composed of two silk strips as the paintings were originally screen panels, but were later arranged on a single kakemono. Despite depicting the seasons sequentially as Spring-Summer-Autumn-Winter, the Autumn scroll is distinctively different. From Sesshū&#x27;s travels, Autumn holds a dominating Chinese stylistic influence. For example, Sesshū&#x27;s use of the Chinese technique progressive vision, where using several viewpoints creates an image more accurate to one&#x27;s experience with nature, suggesting a synthesis of time and space. Sesshū&#x27;s treatment of pine needles aligns with the method of sung-yeh-tien whilst the dotted leaves mirror ku-chiao-tien (black-pepper-dots), which were techniques shared by Chinese artists before Sesshū. Within this painting, Sesshū reduces proportions as the space recedes whilst placing distant objects higher in the composition. This is heightened through atmospheric perspective where Sesshū ambiguously manipulates the line quality and texture for recession. Overall, &quot;Four Landscape Scrolls of the Seasons&quot; demonstrates Chinese influences on Sesshū&#x27;s work and his use of space and composition to represent the soul of nature in the landscapes.

=== &quot;Birds and Flowers&quot; (c. 1420–1506) ===
The influences of Sesshū&#x27;s studies in China are reflected in two famous hanging scrolls of seasonal landscape paintings of birds and flowers, painted in ink and colour on silk, in the Perry Collection. Sesshū paints assertive rock contours and textures using a wet brush with splitting hairs. This brings a scratchy, rough texture to give the rocks a sense of solidity and tangibility. Such technique can be seen in the &quot;Four Landscape Scrolls of the Seasons&quot; Autumn and Winter landscapes. As a recurring motif in Sesshū&#x27;s landscapes, the rock is trapezoidal with two indentations on top. Like in &quot;Winter Landscape,&quot; Sesshū uses a zigzag, or lighting shape to contribute to the composition&#x27;s structure. Within this composition, Sesshū flattens space using spatial ambiguities and variations in scale. Sesshū&#x27;s contrast in scale creates an illusion similar to the Zen notion of zero time and space, where there are no distinctions between past, present or future. Compositionally, there is no distinction between the whole image and the subjects that make it. Sesshū purposefully controls tonal intensities to suggest atmospheric perspective through subtle ink gradations for the mist to evoke poetic autumnal feelings.

== Legacy ==

Sesshū&#x27;s emphasis on Zen Buddhism, personal interpretation and economical expression in painting was the basis of his legacy for succeeding Japanese artists. Subsequently, his rendering techniques were widely used by sixteenth-century artists, notably those who attended Sesshū&#x27;s painting schools.

<text>The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) was launched on July 25, 1990, into a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) for a nominal three-year mission to investigate fields, plasmas, and energetic particles inside the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. As part of the CRRES program, the SPACERAD (Space Radiation Effects) project, managed by Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, investigated the radiation environment of the inner and outer radiation belts and measured radiation effects on state-of-the-art microelectronics devices.

CRRES carried an array experiments including chemical releases and a complement of sophisticated scientific instruments to accomplish these objectives. Other chemical release active experiments were performed with sub-orbital rocket probes. The chemical releases &#x27;painted&#x27; the magnetic and electric fields of earthspace with clouds of glowing ions. Earthspace was the laboratory, and the releases were studied with an extensive network of ground-, aircraft-, and satellite-based diagnostic instruments.
Other magnetospheric, ionospheric, and cosmic ray experiments were also included onboard CRRES and supported by NASA or the Office of Naval Research. The chemical release project was managed by NASA/MSFC and utilized the release of chemicals from onboard canisters at low altitudes near dawn and dusk perigee times and at high altitudes near local midnight. The chemical releases were monitored with optical and radar instrumentation by ground-based observers to measure the bulk properties and movement of the expanding clouds of photo-ionized plasma along field lines after the releases occurred. In order to study the magnetosphere at different local times during the mission, the satellite orbit was designed to precess with respect to the Earth-Sun line such that the local time at apogee decreased by 2.5 minutes/day from 08:00 (LT) just after launch and returned to this position in nineteen month cycles.

The CRRES spacecraft had the shape of an octagonal prism with solar arrays on the top side. The prism is 1 m high and 3 m between opposite faces. Four of the eight compartments were for the chemical canisters and the other four housed the Space Radiation Effects and other experiments. The spacecraft body was spun at 2.2 rpm about a spin axis in the ecliptic plane and kept pointed about 12 degrees ahead of the Sun&#x27;s apparent motion in celestial coordinates. The spacecraft was built by Ball Aerospace and was originally intended for launch by the U.S. Space Shuttle. The Challenger accident in 1986 resulted in a need to reconfigure the spacecraft and mission for launch by a medium expendable launch vehicle (Atlas I). Pre-launch and in-flight operations were supported by the Space Test and Transportation Program Office of the U.S. Air Force Space Division.

Communications with CRRES abruptly stopped on October 12, 1991. Analysis presumed that an onboard battery failure resulted in loss of power to various systems resulting in a premature end to the mission about one year after launch instead of the original three-year plan.

<doc id="846211" wikidata="Q131121421" url="?curid=846211" title="Billy cart">
<text>A billy cart is a popular Australian form of gravity powered vehicle, often homemade and constructed for either recreational or competitive use. The name of the cart tends to vary regionally, with synonyms &quot;go cart&quot; and &quot;hill trolley&quot;.

== History ==

=== 1880s-1890s ===

The first references to billy carts appear in the 1880s, with the term identified as originating from wooden carts pulled by billygoats, with these carts being a commonplace occurrence throughout Australia prior to the emergence of the automobile.

These carts were adapted over time to become both a tool and toy for children, featuring a design comprising primarily timber materials with four wheels and a front steering system which utilised a pivoting axle design. Rope was then attached to this pivoting axle to enable the cart to be pulled or steered by hand. This design was advantageous for kids who would scavenge areas for food, scrap materials and more, whilst also becoming a pastime wherein children would challenge others to see who could travel the fastest/furthest with gravity to assist in building momentum.

=== 1900s-1950s ===
The early to mid 1900s are considered to be the time in which billy carts were most popular, as most Australians had become aware of the carts and due to the low cost and simple design were easy to construct. Many such examples were constructed either from scrap timber/offcuts or from wooden crates which had been used to transport goods such as produce. During World War II, billy carts were utilised by children tasked with collecting waste from the community as part of the war effort.

As automobiles rose to prevalence during this time there was an increase in incidents involving billy carts identified, this can be attributed to the fact that impromptu races organised by neighbourhood children were often run on the same roads as vehicles, without road closures, and as car ownership grew in suburban areas of Australia the risk of colliding with vehicles grew.

In 1952, seeking to aid his son&#x27;s lawnmowing business, Mervyn Victor Richardson created a prototype lawnmower, utilising scrap metal and recycled household items, including wheels from a billy cart. Following the successful prototype Richardson created the Victa Mowers company, producing lawnmowers which quickly became an Australian icon.

=== 1960s-1990s ===
Whilst no longer as popular as they once were the mid to late 1900s were seen to bring on the rise of organised competitions. This can be linked both to the nostalgia of parents who built carts in the decades prior providing the same opportunity for their children, and to the immense popularity of Soapbox Racing in the United States.

During this time some competitive carts could be seen to adopt similar design cues to the American Soapbox, with an aerodynamic streamlined design, lay-down configuration and front pivot axle steering which was aided by a steering wheel to improve safety and control of the cart at higher speeds.

The more traditional cart style however remained a staple of recreational use, used by children living in suburbs either on grassed hills or streets with low volumes of vehicle traffic. This cart style was also often used competitively as the simple and low-cost design enabled them to be built by children with minimal assistance from adults, allowing for unofficial competition and collaboration to occur between children within a community. Billy cart derbies were often utilised during this time as popular community events, aimed at creating a rich environment of community participation and also further benefit as a fundraising opportunity.

In 1981, The Perth Soapbox Club (Founded 1968) was successful in securing a location for a dedicated race track, located in the Western Australia Sporting Car Club complex. Following its construction it remains today as the only dedicated facility/track in Australia for billy cart racing.

=== 2000s-2020s ===
Whilst the popularity of billy carts as a competitive sport has declined from the mid-late 1900s there remains a dedicated number of groups which organise annual derbys as a community event. Similarly, there is a large following of the sport, with a significant online and social media presence, particularly as corporations such as Redbull have developed billy cart races into a popular form of online content, creating strong links between entertainment, community experience and a recognisable sporting brand identity. The recreational appeal of billy carts has also remained relevant, with research reaffirming the social and health benefits associated with activities such as building and using billy carts in the backyard, local streets and parks.

A number of events are still held throughout Australia, aimed at bringing together the local community, and encouraging children to stay active and spend time outside in a unique low-cost sociable environment which encourages intergenerational participation. These events are also successful in attracting visitors from surrounding communities and interstate.

The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Australia resulted in all annual Billy cart derbies throughout the country being put on hold as event organisers were unable to hold events due to social distancing and other measures implemented by local, state and federal governments. This also resulted in a number of events held annually prior to the outbreak in 2020 being cancelled or postponed indefinitely by organisers.

Rising costs associated with organising billy cart derbies have pressured a number of event organisers to either relocate or cancel events, particularly costs associated with insurance, as a result most events held today require sponsors to pay the costs associated with organising an event. Other pressures include complaints from locals regarding temporary road closures and inflation.

== Design and construction ==
Official rules and regulations for billy cart derbies typically vary between organises, due in part to track layouts, estimated cart speeds, safety concerns &amp; other constraints such as starting ramps.

As a result there are no well-defined categories for design, however it is often observed to be two distinct design styles; traditional &amp; professional. It is commonplace to see these categories separated at organised events to enable increased fairness of competition between entrants.

=== Traditional ===

Traditional carts retain many design cues from billy carts constructed throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. These include a mostly timber design, upright seating, pivoting front axle with rope steering, and solid wheels. Optional design features include a scrub brake on either one or both rear wheels and a wooden block to limit the pivot angle of the front axle.

Many guides are available online detailing the construction process and this style remains to be a low cost and simple design, able to be easily constructed with common hand and power tools and are still often utilised recreationally by Australian children as well as organisations such as Scouts due to the simplicity of construction.

A number of manufacturers produce these carts for a relatively low cost and can be found in stores throughout Australia as well as online retailers.

=== Professional ===

Professional carts form a much broader scope of designs compared to traditional carts, these carts are often capable of reaching speeds much higher than traditional designs as they are larger and heavier, and as such also may feature a range of safety features such as seatbelts and rollcages. Steering is often required by event organisers to utilise either a steering shaft and tie rod design, or handlebars, whilst brakes may range from scrub brakes to rim or disc brakes, typically required to be installed on two or more wheels. The overall construction of carts typically include either timber or metal frames, with most lightweight materials also permitted by event organisers, many carts using materials such as corrugated plastic, polycarbonate, fibreglass and carbon fibre in their designs to improve aerodynamics.

Pneumatic wheels are often utilised for professional carts, repurposed from common items such as wheelbarrows, push bikes and wheelchairs. These are often limited in size by event organisers to ensure safety and typically may either be constructed in a three or four wheel configuration depending on organiser restrictions.

Many professional carts are homemade, however often may require additional power tools during the construction process, due to this, particularly in recent years, many carts are fabricated professionally with some higher-end carts valued around $5000.

It is common that professional carts are designed around a specific theme, these themes can also be an ideal starting point for the design process as it can allow for the design to be unique yet recognisable. One of the most common themes for billy cart designs are vehicles, with some based on vehicle styles such as hot-rods and classic cars, whilst other vehicles used for inspiration include vehicles popularised in film and tv franchises, however designs can often include a broad range of local or pop culture references.

== Billy carts in Australian education ==
STEM Education

STEM Education programs within Australia have incorporated billy cart&#x27;s into a number of programs, with the simplicity of billy cart design allowing for kids of all ages to attempt their own project in a hands-on environment and develop critical thinking skills whilst also learning from the range of mathematical and scientific factors that determine what makes a billy cart design fast including rolling resistance, aerodynamics, and wheel diameters. These programs provide students with an opportunity to create &amp; build upon skills which can be further applied in future studies and careers.

One STEM program sought to address high school students (year 10) not selecting higher level mathematics and science subjects for their final years of study, to achieve this the Design Technology class created a project which involved constructing a billy cart in stages and integrated each of these stages with mathematics and science classes wherein teachers would explore relevant topics such as budgeting, associations between wheel sizes, speed, stability and the forces which affect a billy cart&#x27;s competitive ability. This program was successful in increasing student enthusiasm for the STEM subjects involved and was found to have positively changed student attitudes on selecting higher level mathematics and science subjects for their final years of study.

Flexible learning programs

Flexible learning option programs can utilise billy carts to provide at-risk students with the opportunity and means to develop key life skills such as engineering, building and design in a hands on environment, with these types of billy cart programs better suited for students which struggle in mainstream classrooms yet thrive in applied learning scenarios. Such inclusions of billy carts in flexible learning can occur either as school-supported entries into existing billy cart races organised outside of schools, or as school-based events organised by the schools themselves.

Incursions, excursions &amp; school-based programs

Billy carts have been widely identified as a great low cost, low risk opportunity for young students to learn key skills such as problem solving and communication in a fun, active and engaging manner. A number of organisations which provide school incursion &amp; excursion programs have included billy carts as a program option, typically requiring students to utilise simple tools and teamwork to build a simple billy cart kit before racing around a short track either being pushed or utilising small hills.

<text>Willard Warner (September 4, 1826 – November 23, 1906) was a brevet brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was a U.S. senator from the state of Alabama after the war.

==Early life and career==
Warner was born in Granville, Ohio. His great-grandfather was Luke Knowlton, a founder of Newfane, Vermont, and a leader of Vermont during the American Revolution. He graduated from Marietta College, and founded the Newark Machine Works in Newark, Ohio. He was the brother-in-law of future Civil War general Charles R. Woods of Newark.

==Civil War==
In December 1861, Warner joined the volunteer army as major of the 76th Ohio Infantry. He served in several battles in the Western Theater, including the Battle of Fort Donelson, the Siege of Corinth, and the Vicksburg Campaign. In 1863 he became lieutenant colonel of the regiment, which he led from Vicksburg to Chattanooga. He served on the staff of William T. Sherman during the Atlanta Campaign as the inspector general.

In October 1864, he was named as colonel of the 180th Ohio Infantry. He received the brevet ranks of brigadier general and major general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and mustered out in July of that year.

He served one term in the Ohio State Senate immediately after the war, removed to the South in 1867, where he engaged in cotton-planting and was a member of the Alabama House of Representatives in the succeeding year. Elected upon readmission of Alabama to the Union, the Republican served as a Senator from July 13, 1868, to March 3, 1871, alongside George E. Spencer. He was the last Republican to hold the seat until Jeff Sessions&#x27; election in 1996. He did not win reelection, turned down Grant&#x27;s tendered appointment as Governor of New Mexico, and returned to Alabama and later to Tennessee to pursue various business interests.

He was collector of customs at Mobile, Alabama, from July 1871 until February 1872, when he declined the appointment of Governor of New Mexico, as he did the diplomatic post of Minister to Argentina. He was a member of the Republican National Convention of 1868. In 1873 he organized the Tecumseh Iron Company, and in 1887 he was elected president of the Nashville Iron, Steel, and Charcoal Company.

He died in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Newark, Ohio.

<text>George Goldthwaite (December 10, 1809March 16, 1879) was an Alabama Supreme Court justice and U.S. senator for Alabama. He served in the Senate from March 4, 1871, to March 3, 1877, and did not run for reelection.

He was a native of Boston, Massachusetts. He succeeded William P. Chilton as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama in 1856. State legislators from Alabama wrote to the U.S. Senate in protest of his election stating he did not receive a majority of the votes from state legislators and was therefore not elected legitimately. He was seated and remained in office.

A great-grandson, George G. Siebels, Jr., was a 20th-century mayor of Birmingham and a member of the Alabama House of Representatives. Another descendant, Alfred Goldthwaite, was a state representative from Montgomery and a state chairman of the Alabama Republican Party.

In 1853 he ruled that a freed woman in Ohio could be returned so slavery to satisfy the debts of her former owner but that her son could not.

<doc id="846217" wikidata="Q1701978" url="?curid=846217" title="John T. Morgan">
<text>John Tyler Morgan (June 20, 1824 – June 11, 1907) was an American politician who was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War and later was elected for six terms as the U.S. Senator (1877–1907) from the state of Alabama. A prominent slaveholder before the Civil War, he became the second Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama during the Reconstruction era. Morgan and fellow Klan member Edmund W. Pettus became the ringleaders of white supremacy in Alabama and did more than anyone else in the state to overthrow Reconstruction efforts in the wake of the Civil War. When President Ulysses S. Grant dispatched U.S. Attorney General Amos Akerman to prosecute the Klan under the Enforcement Acts, Morgan was arrested and jailed.

Due to his notoriety in Alabama for opposing Reconstruction efforts, Morgan was elected as a U.S. Senator in 1876. During his subsequent six terms as Senator, he was an outspoken proponent of black disfranchisement, racial segregation, and lynching African-Americans. According to historians, he played a leading role &quot;in forging the ideology of white supremacy that dominated American race relations from the 1890s to the 1960s.&quot; Widely considered to be among the most notorious racist ideologues of his time, he is often credited by scholars with laying the foundation of the Jim Crow era.

In addition to his lifelong efforts to uphold white supremacy, Morgan became an ardent expansionist and imperialist during the Gilded Age. He envisioned the United States as a globe-spanning empire and believed that island nations such as Hawaii and the Philippines should be forcibly annexed in order for the country to dominate trade in the Pacific Ocean. Accordingly, he advocated for the United States to annex the independent Republic of Hawaii and to construct an inter-oceanic canal in Central America. Due to this advocacy, he was often posthumously referred to as &quot;the Father of the Panama Canal&quot; despite being a proponent of the Canal to be located in Nicaragua. Morgan was a staunch opponent of women&#x27;s suffrage.

After his death by heart attack in 1907, Morgan&#x27;s numerous relatives remained influential in Alabama politics and high society for many decades. His extended family owned the First White House of the Confederacy in Montgomery. His nephew and protege, Anthony Dickinson Sayre, was President of the Alabama State Senate and later an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama. Sayre played a pivotal role in passing the landmark 1893 Sayre Act which disenfranchised black Alabamians for seventy years and ushered in the Jim Crow period in the state. Morgan&#x27;s grand-niece was Jazz Age socialite Zelda Sayre, the wife of novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald.

== Early life and career ==
John Tyler Morgan was born in a log cabin one mile from Athens, Tennessee. His family claimed descent from a Welsh ancestor, James B. Morgan (1607–1704), who settled in the Connecticut Colony. Morgan was initially educated by his mother but, in the fall of 1830, the six-year-old barefoot boy walked a quarter of a mile each day to attend Old Forest Hill Academy.

In 1833, his family moved to Calhoun County, Alabama, where he attended schools and then studied law in Tuskegee with justice William Parish Chilton, his brother-in-law. After admission to the Alabama bar, he established a practice in Talladega. Ten years later, Morgan moved to Dallas County and resumed the practice of law in Selma and Cahaba. By 1857, he had grown prosperous and owned over half-a-dozen slaves—including an entire family who served as his personal household servants.

=== Early political activity ===

Turning to politics, Morgan aligned himself with the pro-slavery Fire-Eaters led by fellow Alabama politician William Lowndes Yancey and became an ardent exponent of the Southern secession movement. He became a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket in 1860, and tentatively supported Southern Democrat John C. Breckinridge. One year later, he was a delegate from Dallas County to the Alabama constitutional convention of 1861, and he played a key role in passing the ordinance of secession.

Amid the fractious debates at the Alabama constitutional convention, a 36-year-old Morgan defended slavery—including the transatlantic slave trade—as a morally-uplifting and Christian institution. As a proud slaveholder, he publicly declared his reasons for advocating Alabama&#x27;s secession from the Union in a speech on January 25, 1861: &quot;The Ordinance of Secession rests, in a great measure, upon our assertion of a right to enslave the African race, or, what amounts to the same thing, to hold them in slavery.&quot; At the close of this same speech in 1861, Morgan envisioned a future slave-holding territory spanning the Gulf of Mexico and the islands of the Caribbean.

== American Civil War ==

After Alabama seceded from the Union and the commencement of the Civil War, the 37-year-old Morgan enlisted as a private in the Cahaba Rifles, which volunteered its services in the Confederate Army and was assigned to the 5th Alabama Infantry. He first saw action in a skirmish preceding the First Battle of Manassas in the summer of 1861.

As the war progressed, Morgan rose to major and then lieutenant colonel. He served under Col. Robert E. Rodes, a future Confederate general. Morgan resigned his commission in 1862 and returned to Alabama, where in August he recruited a new regiment, the 51st Alabama Partisan Rangers, becoming its colonel. He led it at the Battle of Murfreesborough, operating in cooperation with the cavalry of Nathan Bedford Forrest.

When Rodes was promoted to major general and given a division in the Army of Northern Virginia, Morgan declined an offer to command Rodes&#x27;s old brigade and instead remained in the Western Theater, leading troops at the Battle of Chickamauga. On November 16, 1863, he was appointed as a brigadier general of cavalry and participated in the Knoxville Campaign. His brigade consisted of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 9th, and 51st Alabama Cavalry regiments.

His men were routed and dispersed by Federal cavalry on January 27, 1864. He was reassigned to a new command and fought in the Atlanta Campaign. Subsequently, his men harassed William T. Sherman&#x27;s troops during the March to the Sea. Soon after, he was stripped of his command due to drunkenness and reassigned to administrative duty in Demopolis, Alabama. At the time of the Confederacy&#x27;s collapse and the end of the war, Morgan attempted with little success to organize Alabama black troops for home defense.

== Reconstruction era ==

After the war ended, Morgan resumed his law practice in Selma, Alabama. He became the affluent legal representative for the widely-loathed railroad companies. By 1867, angered by formerly enslaved persons serving as state legislators, Morgan began to play a highly public role against the Republican Reconstruction.

Soon after, Morgan toured throughout the American South giving race-baiting speeches and urging fellow Southerners to refuse all compromise with Reconstruction. Aligning himself with the Bourbon Democrats and employing their electoral strategy, Morgan wrote numerous newspaper editorials urging white Alabama voters to &quot;redeem&quot; their state from Republican control and to unite against African-Americans for &quot;self-preservation.&quot;

Amid his political struggle against Reconstruction in 1872, Morgan succeeded James H. Clanton as the second Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama. According to Alabama Representative Robert Stell Heflin, Morgan and fellow Klan member Edmund W. Pettus became the ringleaders of white supremacy in the state who, more than anyone else, &quot;resisted and finally broke down and destroyed the reconstruction policy which followed the Civil War.&quot;

When President Ulysses S. Grant dispatched his U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman to vigorously prosecute Alabama Klan under the Enforcement Acts, Morgan was arrested and jailed. After the demise of the first Ku Klux Klan, Morgan and Pettus continued to resist Reconstruction efforts and to reassert white supremacy in Alabama. Morgan took an active part in opposing all attempts to redress the political and socioeconomic legacies of slavery in Alabama.

Due to his efforts to suppress African-Americans from exercising their political rights and to vouchsafe white supremacy in Alabama during the Reconstruction era, Morgan became a well-known public figure in national politics and subsequently became a presidential elector-at-large on the Democratic Samuel J. Tilden ticket in 1876. Party insiders favored him to win Alabama&#x27;s seat to the United States Senate in that year.

== Senatorship ==

Following his election as U.S. Senator for the state of Alabama in 1876, Morgan was reelected five times in 1882, 1888, 1894, 1900, and 1906. He served as chairman of Committee on Rules (46th U.S. Congress), the Committee on Foreign Relations (53rd U.S. Congress), the Committee on Interoceanic Canals (56th and 57th Congresses), and the Committee on Public Health and National Quarantine (59th U.S. Congress).

He became Alabama&#x27;s leading political spokesperson for nearly half-a-century. For much of his senatorial tenure, he remained aligned with the Bourbon Democrats, and he served in the Senate alongside his close friend Edmund W. Pettus, a former Confederate general and Klan member.

Throughout his senatorship, Morgan staunchly labored for the repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was intended to prevent the denial of voting rights based on race. He frequently urged the disenfranchisement of black citizens in every U.S. state, and he is accordingly credited by scholars with laying the foundation of the Jim Crow era. In a 1890 speech, Morgan declared that, when black residents entered any area, it became necessary to &quot;deny the right of suffrage entirely to every human being.&quot; He likened such mass disenfranchisement to having &quot;to burn down the barn to get rid of the rats.&quot;

Morgan opposed the passage of a woman suffrage&#x27;s amendment, arguing it would draw a “line of political demarcation through a man’s household”. He warned that women&#x27;s suffrage would “open to the intrusion of politics and politicians that sacred circle of the family where no man should be permitted to intrude&quot;.

Due to his relentless efforts to disenfranchise black citizens across the United States and his vociferous championing of congressional legislation &quot;to legalize the practice of racist vigilante murder [lynching] as a means of preserving white power in the Deep South,&quot; Morgan is frequently credited by historians with &quot;forging the ideology of white supremacy that dominated American race relations from the 1890s to the 1960s.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Black repatriation efforts ====
Morgan frequently advocated for the migration of black people to leave the United States. Historian Adam Hochschild notes that, &quot;at various times in his long career Morgan also advocated sending them [negroes] to Hawaii, to Cuba, and to the Philippines—which, perhaps because the islands were so far away, he claimed were a &#x27;native home of the negro.&#x27;&quot;

By the 1880s, Morgan began to focus on the Congo for his repatriation visions. After the Belgian monarch Léopold II signaled that his International Association of the Congo would consider immigration and settlement of African Americans, Morgan became one of the foremost advocates of this emerging colonial enterprise in Central Africa. Morgan&#x27;s support was vital for United States&#x27; early diplomatic recognition of the new colony, which became the Congo Free State in December 1883.

After revelations about major atrocities by the colonial occupiers, Morgan cut his ties with the Congo Free State. He feared the brutality against the inherent African population would deter black U.S. citizens from emigrating and jeopardize his plans to create an exclusively white American nation. Hence, by 1903, Morgan became the most active U.S. congressional spokesperson of the Congo reform movement, a humanitarian pressure group that demanded reforms in the notorious Congo Free State.

The alliance between this pioneering international human rights movement and the radical white supremacist Morgan has often led to scholarly astonishment. However, the sociologist Felix Lösing pointed to the ideological nexus between the racial segregation promoted by Morgan and calls for cultural segregation raised by prominent Congo reformers. Both Morgan and the majority of the Congo reform movement were ultimately concerned with the consolidation of white supremacy on a global scale.

==== Support for imperialism ====
Between 1887 and 1907, Morgan played a leading role on the powerful Foreign Relations Committee. He called for a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through Nicaragua, enlarging the merchant marine and the Navy, and acquiring Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Cuba. He expected Latin American and Asian markets would become a new export market for Alabama&#x27;s cotton, coal, iron, and timber. The canal would make trade with the Pacific much more feasible, and an enlarged military would protect that new trade. By 1905, most of his dreams had become reality, although the canal bifurcated Panama instead of Nicaragua.

Morgan was a strong supporter of the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii, and, in 1894, Morgan chaired an investigation known as the Morgan Report into the Hawaiian Revolution. The investigation concluded that the U.S. had remained completely neutral in the matter. He authored the introduction to the Morgan Report based on the findings of the investigative committee. He later visited Hawaii in 1897 in support of annexation. He believed that the history of the U.S. clearly indicated it was unnecessary to hold a plebiscite in Hawaii as a condition for annexation. He was appointed by President William McKinley in July 1898 to the commission created by the Newlands Resolution to establish government in the Territory of Hawaii. A strong advocate for a Central American canal, Morgan was also a staunch supporter of the Cuban revolutionaries in the 1890s.

== Death and legacy ==

While still in office, Morgan died of a heart attack in Washington, D.C. He was buried in Selma, Alabama, at Live Oak Cemetery, near the grave of fellow Confederate cavalry officer and Klan member Nathan Bedford Forrest. The remainder of Morgan&#x27;s term was served by John H. Bankhead.

In April 2004, Professor Thomas Adams Upchurch summarized Morgan&#x27;s career and legacy in the &quot;Alabama Review&quot;:

=== Family and relatives ===
As the patriarch of a powerful Southern family, Morgan&#x27;s extended relatives remained influential in Alabama politics for many decades and owned the First White House of the Confederacy in Montgomery. His nephew and protege, Anthony Dickinson Sayre (1858–1931), served first as a member of the Alabama State Senate (1894–95) and then as President of the Alabama State Senate (1896–97).

According to historians, Morgan&#x27;s nephew Anthony D. Sayre played a key role in undermining the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments in Alabama and enabling the ideology of white supremacy. As a state legislator, he introduced the landmark 1893 Sayre Act which disenfranchised black Alabamians for nearly a century and ushered in the racially segregated Jim Crow period in the state.

Later, in 1909, Governor Braxton Bragg Comer appointed Sayre as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama. Like his uncle, Sayre was a Bourbon Democrat. Sayre married Minerva Machen (1860-1958), the daughter of Willis B. Machen, a former Confederate Senator and later a U.S. Senator from Kentucky. Sayre&#x27;s daughter and Morgan&#x27;s grand-niece was Jazz Age socialite Zelda Sayre, the mentally-ill wife of novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald who wrote &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. According to biographers, Zelda was extremely proud of her family and her Confederate roots, and she boasted that she drew her strength from Montgomery&#x27;s Confederate past.

Morgan&#x27;s great-grand-niece was Frances &quot;Scottie&quot; Fitzgerald. In 1973, Fitzgerald retired from Washington, D.C. to her mother Zelda Sayre&#x27;s home town of Montgomery, Alabama. After her retirement, she researched her family&#x27;s history and discovered her family&#x27;s pivotal role in disenfranchising &quot;the black people of Alabama, and thousands of poor whites, of the right to vote.&quot; Upon learning of this fact, Scottie felt both embarrassment and guilt. For the remainder of her life, she devoted herself to voter outreach programs in Alabama. According to Scottie, black citizens living in Montgomery still viewed the Sayre family with askance as late as the 1970s, and they would not reciprocate her social overtures.

=== Memorialization ===
* In 1913, a memorial arch was built on the grounds of the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Selma, Alabama, to honor U.S. Senators Morgan and Pettus, both former Grand Dragons of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.
* In 1953, amid national tension over the ongoing Brown v. Board of Education litigation, Morgan was elected by vote to membership in the Alabama Hall of Fame.
* In 1965, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, white segregationists founded the John T. Morgan Academy in Selma. The segregation academy held its classes in Morgan&#x27;s old house until a new campus was built in 1967.
* Morgan Hall on the campus of the University of Alabama, which houses the English Department, was named for him. On December 18, 2015, Morgan&#x27;s portrait was removed from the building, and in 2016 the university was pondering the results of a petition to rename the building for Harper Lee. By June 2020, the Alabama Board of Trustees had finally decided to study the names of buildings on campus and consider changing them. On September 17, 2020, they voted to remove his name from the building.

<text>Dino Campana (20 August 1885 – 1 March 1932) was an Italian visionary poet. His fame rests on his only published book of poetry, the &quot;Canti Orfici&quot; (&quot;Orphic Songs&quot;), as well as his wild and erratic personality, including his ill-fated love affair with Sibilla Aleramo. He is often seen as an Italian example of a poète maudit.

==Life==
Campana was born near Faenza in the small town of Marradi, which is found in the Apennines along the border between the regions of Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany. His father Giovanni, who was always affectionate and understanding with Dino, was an elementary school principal, and forthright member of the community, but had a weak and neurotic character. His mother, Fanny Luti, came from a wealthy family but was an eccentric and compulsive woman, affected by mental illness. She would often wander the hills, forgetting about family duties, but was overly attached to Dino&#x27;s brother Manlio, born in 1888. After his younger brother arrived, Dino was overlooked by his mother and had to fight for her affection.

In 1900, at approximately fifteen years of age, Campana was diagnosed with the first symptoms of nervous disturbances, was medicated and sent to an asylum. This did not, however, prevent him from completing most of his schooling. He completed his elementary education in Marradi - his third, fourth and fifth gymnasium years at the Salesiani di Faenza. Afterwards, he began the lyceum at the Liceo Torricelli in Faenza and then in Carmagnola near Turin where he earned his high school diploma in July 1903. When he returned to Marradi his nervous condition worsened and he suffered frequent mood swings - due to the difficult relationship with his family (especially his mother) and the town. To overcome the monotony of winter evenings in Marradi, Dino used to go to the nearby town of &quot;Gerbarola&quot;, where he spent time with the locals enjoying roasted chestnuts (marroni chestnuts grow near Marradi). This type of activity appeared to have a positive effect on his mental health. At the age of 18, in the Autumn of 1903 he enrolled in faculty of chemistry at the University of Bologna. In 1905, after being denied entry into the military as an officer in Ravenna, Dino enrolled in faculty of pharmaceutical chemistry in Florence, but after only a few months he returned to Bologna. Some of his first poetic work would be written here, and later included in Orphic Songs. Campana did not finish university and had a difficult time finding his true calling.

===Journeys===
Campana had an irrepressible desire to escape and dedicate himself to a life of vagrancy, which he accomplished by undertaking various jobs. The first reaction of his family, his town, and the public authorities was to consider Campana&#x27;s strange behavior and travels to foreign countries as an obvious signs of madness. He was judged with suspicion both because his physical traits were considered too German, and due to the vigorous way he discussed poetry and philosophy. Following his journeys, the police (in agreement with the psychiatric practices of the time and the uncertainty of his family), admitted him to a lunatic asylum, at the age of 21.

Between May and July 1906, Campana made a first trip to Switzerland and France, which ended with his arrest in Bardonecchia and his admission to the mental asylum Imola.
In 1907, not knowing what to do about their son&#x27;s madness, Campana&#x27;s parents sent him to stay in Latin America with a family of Italian immigrants. This was not exactly an autonomous journey for the poet, who would not have been able to obtain a passport for the new world by himself, since he was a known ‘madman’ and in fact, his family had to apply for his passport and organise the trip. Campana left out of fear of being sent back to the asylum. Campana&#x27;s parents also supported the move to send him to America, in the hope that it would help him recover, but it seems that the passport was valid only for arrival - likely an attempt to get rid of him, since living with Campana had become unbearable, at that point. It seems that his mother had come to believe that her son was the Antichrist.

His travels in America represent a particularly obscure and unknown point in Campana&#x27;s biography: there are those who see him as ‘the poet of two worlds’, while others instead claim that Campana did not even travel to the continent. There are also different opinions about possible dates of travel and the route home. The most credible hypothesis is that he left in the autumn of 1907 from Genova, and wandered around Argentina until the spring of 1909, when he returned to Marradi, and was subsequently arrested. After a short intermission at San Salvi in Florence, he left for Belgium, but was arrested again in Brussels, and was interned in a ‘maison de santé’ in Tournai at the start of 1910. After asking his family for help, he was sent back to Marradi and lived through a quieter period, likely re-enrolling in university.

===&quot;Canti Orfici&quot;===

In its original form, Campana&#x27;s only book of poetry contained poems composed between 1906 and 1913. In 1913 Campana went to Florence, to meet with Lacerba magazine associates Giovanni Papini and poet/painter Ardengo Soffici (his distant relative), to deliver his manuscript for publication, entitled &quot;The longest day&quot;. It was not taken into account and the manuscript was lost, only to be found in 1971, after the death of Soffici, among his papers in the house of Poggio a Caiano (probably in the same place where it had been abandoned and forgotten). After a few months of waiting Campana travelled from Marradi to Florence to recover his manuscript. Papini did not have it and sent him to Soffici who denied that he ever had the booklet. Campana, whose mind was already frail, became angry and despondent, for he had delivered, trustingly, the only copy he had. His continual pleading only won him the contempt and indifference of the cultural milieu that revolved around the &#x27;red shirts&#x27; of the Caffè Giubbe Rosse. Finally, exasperated, Campana threatened to come with a knife to take justice from the &#x27;infamous&#x27; Soffici and his associates, whom he called &quot;&#x27;sciacalli&quot;&#x27; (jackals).

In the winter of 1914, convinced he could no longer recover the manuscript, Campana decided to rewrite everything, relying on memory and his sketches. In a few days, working at night and at the cost of huge mental effort, he managed to rewrite the poetry, albeit with modifications and additions. In the spring of 1914, with the help of a local printer of religious tracts, Campana was finally able to self-publish the collection &#x27;Orphic Songs&#x27; at his own expense, the title a reference to the mythic figure of Orpheus, the first of poet-musicians. The first edition constituted around 500 copies (originally meant to be 1,000). 44 copies were sold on subscription and Campana attempted, with marginal success, to sell the remainder of his portion of the run (the printer had taken half the books as partial printing payment) himself at cafes in Florence.

The text is an autobiographical journey from Marradi through Bologna, Genova, Argentina and back to Genoa. Paralleling the actual physical journey is a spiritual and mystical voyage undertaken by Campana in search of The Longest Day of Genoa (il più lungo giorno di Genova)- his concept of an eternal moment (l&#x27;eterno presente) outside of normal space-time in which everything and everywhere exists simultaneously. This concept is not explicitly defined in the text, which is less expository or didactic than incantatory in nature. Indeed, it has been left to his critics to extrapolate much of the underlying theory in Campana&#x27;s work.

An erratic autodidact, Campana taught himself functional French, German and English- enough to read the Symbolists and Whitman in the original languages. The text is subtitled, in German, &quot;The Tragedy of the Last German in Italy&quot; and is dedicated to Kaiser William II. Campana ended his book with a faultily remembered quotation in English from &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;: “They were all torn and cover&#x27;d with the boy&#x27;s blood”.

The original manuscript was found amongst Soffici&#x27;s belongings in 1971. This find demonstrated that not only had Campana rewritten the original text almost perfectly but had also nearly doubled it in size. This has led some to suggest that Campana had another copy of the manuscript from which he “reconstructed” the work.

===Later years===
In 1915, Campana again went travelling, without a fixed goal: passing through Turin, Domodossola, and then Florence. At the outbreak of the First World War, Campana the pacifist and neutralist, was exempt from military service, ostensibly because of physical health problems, but in reality he was known to be seriously mentally ill.

In 1916 the poet looked for employment in vain. He wrote to Emilio Cecchi and began a short correspondence with the author. At Livorno he met with the journalist Athos Gastone Banti, who wrote him a disparaging article in the journal &quot;Il Telegrafo&quot;: this nearly ended in a duel. In the same year Campana met Sibilla Aleramo, the author of the novel &quot;Una donna&quot;, and began an intense and tumultuous relationship with her, that she ended at the start of 1917 after a brief encounter at Christmas 1916 in Marradi. Their letters and correspondence, published by Feltrinelli in 2000, are testimony of the relationship between Campana and Aleramo. This correspondence begins with a letter from Aleramo dated June 10, 1916, where author expresses her admiration for &quot;Canti Orfici&quot;, declaring the poems have &#x27;enchanted and bedazzled&#x27; her. The letter was written while Sibilla was on holiday at the Villa La Topaia in Borgo San Lorenzo and Campana was in a critical condition at Firenzuola, recovering from a partial paralysis on his right side.

In 1918, Campana was once again admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Castel Pulci, in Scandicci (Florence), where he was to remain until his death. The only surviving accounts of this period of Campana&#x27;s life are in the interviews with the psychiatrist Carlo Pariani, who confirmed the irrefutable diagnosis of Campana&#x27;s mental state: Disorganised schizophrenia - an incurable and extremely serious form of schizophrenia. Dino Campana died, seemingly from sepsis on March 1, 1932. One theory is that the infection was caused by a barbed wire injury during an escape attempt.

The following day, the body of Campana was buried in the cemetery of San Colombano in Badia a Settimo, Scandicci. In 1942, on the behest of Piero Bargellini, the remains of the poet were given a more dignified burial and the body was transferred to the chapel below the bell tower of the Church of San Salvatore. During the Second World War, on August 4, 1944, the retreating German army blew up the bell tower, destroying the chapel. In 1946, following a ceremony attended by numerous Italian intellectuals, including Eugenio Montale, Alfonso Gatto, Carlo Bo, Ottone Rosai, Pratolini and others, the bones of the poet were placed inside the church of San Salvatore Badia a Settimo, where they remain today.

==Poetry==

Campana&#x27;s poetry is a new poetry in which sounds, colors and music are blended in a powerful vision. The line is undefined, an expressive articulation of monotony, but at the same time full of dramatic images of annihilation and purity. The title of Campana&#x27;s only published work alludes to the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, a literary genre developed in ancient Greece between the second and third century AD and characterized by a non-classical theogony. Also prayers to the gods (especially the god Phanes) are characterized by spells to prevent evil and misfortune.

===Key Themes===

One of the major themes of Campana, which is present at the beginning of the &quot;Orphic Songs&quot; in the early prose parts - &quot;The Night&quot;, &quot;Journey and Return&quot; - is the obscurity between dream and wakefulness. Adjectives and adverbs return with the repetitive insistence of a dreamer&#x27;s speech: a dream, however, that is interrupted by startling shifts in tone (as in the poem &quot;The Skylight&quot;). 
In the second part - the nocturne of &quot;Genoa&quot;, all the basic mythic figures and scenes that will preoccupy Campana return: port cities, barbaric mother figures, enormous prostitutes, windy plains, the captive teenager. 
Even in his prose poems, the use of repetition, superlatives, and keywords, as well as the effect of resonance in prepositions, create a strong scene.

===Interpretation===

In the fifteen years following his death at the end of World War II, and before, during the period of expressionism and futurism, the interpretation of Campana&#x27;s poetry focused on the apparently uncontrolled depth of the word, hidden in a psychological state of hallucination and ruin. 
In his verse, where there is evidence of weak supervision and rough writing, there is - according to many critics - the vitality of the turn of the century avant-garde. Because of this, many different poets have been drawn to his poetry, such as Mario Luzi, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Andrea Zanzotto.

<text>John Hollis Bankhead (September 13, 1842March 1, 1920) was an American politician and Confederate Army soldier. A member of the Democratic Party, Bankhead served as U.S. Senator from the state of Alabama from 1907 until his death in 1920. Bankhead had additionally served in the United States House of Representatives, the Alabama Legislature, and as warden of the state penitentiary in Wetumpka.

==Early life and military service==
Bankhead was born on September 13, 1842, at Moscow, present-day Lamar County, Alabama (near present-day Sulligent), the son of Susan Fleming (Hollis) and James Greer Bankhead. His great-grandfather, James Bankhead (1738–1799) was born in Ulster and settled in South Carolina.

He was educated in the common schools and served in the Confederate States Army, during the Civil War, rising to the rank of captain, in the Alabama 16th Infantry, Company K.

== Career ==
After the Civil War, Bankhead went on to serve as warden of the state penitentiary in Wetumpka. During this period, he was said to have taken part of the exploitation of inmates as cheap labor for industry as part of Alabama&#x27;s convict-leasing system.

Bankhead was a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from 1865 to 1867, and again in 1880 and 1881. In 1876 and 1877 he was a member of the State Senate. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1887, serving until 1907.

=== U.S. Senate ===
At age 65, John H. Bankhead was appointed, then elected, to serve out the remainder of the U.S. Senate term left by the death of John Tyler Morgan and later re-elected twice. He served from June 18, 1907, until his death in Washington on March 1, 1920.

Bankhead was a member of the Inland Waterways Commission in 1907, and was instrumental in enacting the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, which became the first federal highway funding legislation.
He was also a member of the Commission on Public Buildings and the Commission on Rivers and Harbors. He wrote several books relating to post roads.

Bankhead served as campaign manager for Oscar Underwood&#x27;s 1912 presidential candidacy. During his Senate tenure, Bankhead opposed the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which mandated nationwide women&#x27;s suffrage.

Following his death, B. B. Comer, a former governor of Alabama, was appointed to serve the rest of his term until November 2, 1920, when J. Thomas Heflin was elected to serve out the term.

== Personal life ==
He married Tallulah James Brockman. She was of Revolutionary ancestry, her father&#x27;s great-grandfather, Benjamin Kilgore, having been a captain of a South Carolina company in the War of the Revolution. She was the daughter of James H. Brockman, a native of Greenville District, South Carolina.

Her education was received in the fashionable schools of Tuskegee and Montgomery, Alabama. Their two elder sons, John Hollis and William Brockman, were practicing lawyers. The youngest, Henry McAuley, was a student at the University of Alabama. The elder daughter, Louise, married Representative William Hayne Perry, of Greenville, South Carolina, son of former South Carolina governor Benjamin Franklin Perry and the younger, Marie, was the wife of Thomas McAdory Owen, a historian by profession.

=== Legacy ===
United States Senator John H. Bankhead II and Speaker of the House William Brockman Bankhead were his sons, and actress Tallulah Bankhead was his granddaughter. The cross-country Bankhead Highway was named after him, as is Bankhead Lake on the Black Warrior River near Birmingham. Also, the Bankhead Tunnel on US 98 in Mobile, Alabama, is named after him.

<doc id="846228" wikidata="Q7542349" url="?curid=846228" title="Slurve">
<text>The slurve is a baseball pitch in which the pitcher throws a curve ball as if it were a slider. The pitch is gripped like a curve ball, but thrown with a slider velocity. The term is a portmanteau of slider and curve.

==History==
Johnny Sain of the Boston Braves was known to throw a slurve in the 1940s. On May 6, 1998, Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs utilized the slurve in a major-league record-tying 20 strikeout game. Los Angeles Dodgers, Yakult Swallows, and Seibu Lions pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, despite his well-documented control problems, used a slurve almost exclusively against left-handers. Alfredo Aceves from the Boston Red Sox was also known to throw a slurve. Stephen Strasburg claims to throw a slurve, although experts still call his pitch a curveball. Hall of Fame relief pitcher Goose Gossage stated that learning how to throw a slurve changed his career in his Yankeeography. Both Cy Young and Walter Johnson had slurves in their arsenals and the former is the earliest known user of the pitch, having started his career in 1890.

==Concerns in pitching==
Critics of the slurve call the pitch a sloppy slider because of its wide break. They claim that the slurve produces more home runs than a late-breaking slider. The usefulness of the slurve is debated. The slurve is also claimed to cause problems to a pitcher. In 1998, Kerry Wood claimed his elbow soreness was caused by throwing the slurve.

<doc id="846230" wikidata="Q1700299" url="?curid=846230" title="John H. Bankhead II">
<text>John Hollis Bankhead II (July 8, 1872 – June 12, 1946) was a U.S. senator from the state of Alabama. Like his father, John H. Bankhead, he was elected three times to the Senate, and like his father, he died in office.

He served in the Senate from March 4, 1931, to his death on June 12, 1946. He was first elected to the Senate in 1930 by defeating J. Thomas Heflin, the man who succeeded his father. Though Bankhead won the election by 20 points, Heflin challenged the results for over a year. He served as chairman of the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation. After his death, Bankhead was succeeded by George R. Swift, who was appointed to fill his seat until a successor, John J. Sparkman, could be elected. Bankhead is remembered as a spokesman for farmers and against civil rights for African Americans.

==Life and career==
Bankhead was born on July 8, 1872, at the Bankhead plantation in Lamar County, Alabama, the son of Tallulah James Brockman and John Hollis Bankhead. After earning his law degree in 1893 and practicing law for ten with his brother William, Bankhead was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1903. After Alabama&#x27;s grandfather clause, which disenfranchised most black voters, was declared unconstitutional, Bankhead was one of the drafters of Alabama&#x27;s revised voting law effectively preventing most black voters from registering via a series of tests and poll taxes.

Following his controversial win over Heflin in 1930, the Senator from Alabama worked at the passage of various pieces of New Deal legislation to benefit cotton farmers, including the Subsistence Homestead Act of 1933, the Cotton Control Act of 1934 and the parity payment amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. After World War II began in Europe, Bankhead was an interventionist. He took a &quot;pro-British&quot; stance and favored President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Lend-Lease program. On October 23, 1941, Bankhead voted in favor of additional lend-lease funding to provide more funding to the British Army. On November 7, 1941, he voted in favor of legislation to amend several sections of the neutrality acts. This vote made it easier for the United States to provide direct military aid to the United Kingdom during World War II. In 1943, he sponsored legislation to exempt &quot;substantially fulltime&quot; farm workers from the draft during World War II. Bankhead was among twelve nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election that year. He was in third place, with 98 votes, when Bankhead made a surprise withdrawal of his candidacy in favor of his Senate colleague, Harry S. Truman, who was elected vice president and succeeded to the presidency in 1945.

On May 24, 1946, Senator Bankhead suffered a stroke while attending an evening Senate committee meeting. Three weeks later, he died at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. He was the brother of Speaker of the House William B. Bankhead, and the uncle of actress Tallulah Bankhead.

<doc id="846232" wikidata="Q2412087" url="?curid=846232" title="The Image (1975 film)">
<text>The Image is a 1975 American adult drama that was re-released in an edited version in 1976. The film is also known by two other titles: The Punishment of Anne and The Mistress and the Slave and was directed by Radley Metzger. The film is based upon the classic 1956 sadomasochistic novel &quot;L&#x27;Image&quot;, written by Catherine Robbe-Grillet and published under the pseudonym of &quot;Jean de Berg&quot;.

==Premise==
Jean, a middle-aged writer living in Paris, meets an old friend, Claire, and is soon drawn into her world of sadomasochism along with Claire&#x27;s younger partner Anne.

===Structure===
The film is divided in 10 chapters, titles in white letters on a black background:
==Cast==
* Carl Parker as Jean
* Marilyn Roberts as Claire 
* Mary Mendum (Rebecca Brooke) as Anne then Metzger&#x27;s girlfriend
* Valerie Marron as a Salesgirl

==Reactions==
* &quot;Anyone into sado-masochism will get obvious fulfillment by watching the surface physical thrills that Metzger provides. The true fulfillment for this viewer was delving deeper into the themes of dominance and submission that the characters were exploring in their relationships.&quot; – Boris Lugosi
* &quot;This is a must own for anyone interested in the fetishes portrayed (graphic oral sex, bondage, whipping, and urination), and also for those who would like to see what quality porn can look like.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Image&quot; received mixed critical reviews. Buzz Burgess of &quot;DVDTalk&quot; gave the film four out of five stars for content, stating that &quot;Metzger [...] has created a piece argued by some to be the best erotic film ever made.&quot; Charles Tatum, of &quot;eFilmCritic.com&quot; disliked the film, awarding it just two out of five stars, citing a lack of substance, &quot;&quot;The Image&quot; is just that- pretty pictures of pretty people whipping each other during sexual sessions. Its infamy is understandable, but not deserved.&quot; Michael Den Boer praised the actor&#x27;s performances, especially Brooke&#x27;s, even implying that she carried the film with her portrayal of Anne. Although initially praised in Germany, the film became controversial later, and withdrawn from circulation.

==Notes==
The film &quot;The Image&quot; was released during the Golden Age of Porn (inaugurated by the 1969 release of Andy Warhol &quot;Blue Movie&quot;) in the United States, at a time of &quot;porno chic&quot;, in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert).

According to one film reviewer, Radley Metzger&#x27;s films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984), are noted for their &quot;lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle&quot;. Another reviewer noted that his films were &quot;highly artistic — and often cerebral ... and often featured gorgeous cinematography&quot;. Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.

==Blu-ray release==
In 2011, Synapse Films re-released &quot;The Image&quot; on Blu-ray and DVD. The original 35mm negatives were scanned to facilitate the high definition release. In addition to the visual remastering, the audio was also reworked for the re-release, adding DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 to the Blu-ray. Synapse also created new cover art for the re-release.

<doc id="846239" wikidata="Q637632" url="?curid=846239" title="Preaching to the Perverted (film)">
<text>Preaching to the Perverted is a 1997 British sex comedy-drama film written and directed by Stuart Urban.

The film features Guinevere Turner in her first starring role as Tanya Cheex, a New York dominatrix. Tom Bell plays Henry Harding MP and Christien Anholt plays Peter Emery. In addition, several well-known BDSM performance artists appear, including Chaos Clowns, Luci the Axle Grinder, also known as &quot;Lucifire&quot;, Miss Kimberly, The Fetish Nun, Suzi Woodroffe, and Tutu.

The film was originally developed by the BBC, but they later dropped the script, believing it would never be suitable for broadcast on UK TV. However, in April 2004, the film was shown on terrestrial TV in the United Kingdom on BBC One.

The film was banned in the Republic of Ireland by then-film censor Sheamus Smith on 28 October 1997; he also banned the subsequent video release of the film. The trailer caused a mass recall of the rental VHS release of &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; (which had been passed as an 18), because the trailer had not been classified. 3,300 copies of that cassette were withdrawn and replaced, with a potential fine of €1000 to stores providing it. A 2003 video release in the United States was cut in order to receive an age rating.

In 2013, the film became the first European feature film to be restored and remastered on crowd-funding site Kickstarter by its fans. The remastered Blu-ray became available in August 2013.

==Plot==
Henry Harding MP, a British government minister on a moral crusade, hires an inexperienced young computer whiz kid Peter Emery, who works for a Christian computer company called Holy Hardware, to infiltrate the UK BDSM scene. Harding is set on putting a club called &quot;House of Thwax&quot; run by Mistress Tanya Cheex out of business, and is sure that Peter&#x27;s secretly videotaped evidence of the club&#x27;s activities will do the trick. However, the virginal Peter takes a liking to Tanya Cheex and finds himself falling for the Mistress. Amongst the locations used, Layer Marney Tower in Essex plays a pivotal role for a party scene.

==Reviews==
&quot;Turner makes Sharon Stone look like a mother superior, fiendish cameos from Tom Bell, Ricky Tomlinson etc. ... put on your mask and enjoy the party. This ballsy British independent deserves respect&quot;. Empire Magazine, Jake Hamilton.

&quot;A mesh of glamour and hilarity ... slick, with an excellent cast ... great dialogue&quot;. &#x27;Dillie Tante&#x27; The Independent on Sunday.

*&quot;The film boasts excellent costumes, good acting and is a great vision of what goes on in a good fetish club. Highly recommended!&quot; &quot;Secret Magazine&quot;, February 2003.

&quot;Enjoyably offbeat&quot; The Times 27 April 2004 (TV preview).

* &quot;a kind of high-tech, fast-paced, Moulin Rouge for the fetish world...no wonder it was banned in Ireland&quot; Curve Magazine.
* &quot;Original setting ...sumptuous styling ... treat yourself and enjoy&quot; i-D Magazine 1997.
*&quot;...the club scenes all look fabulous: intelligent use of colour and light.&quot; &quot;Erotic Review&quot;, December 2002.
*&quot;Those who actively participate in the S&amp;M lifestyle may enjoy the lighthearted look at the underground fetish scene, but anyone looking for much more than an offbeat sex comedy is going to be woefully disappointed. &quot;Preaching to the Perverted&quot; lives up to its name by not being able to appeal to anyone but perverts.&quot;&quot; Qwipster&#x27;s Movie Reviews&quot;, December 2003.

In 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the film among the top 10 BDSM-related movies. In a 2020 retrospective on depictions of BDSM in cinema, the BFI noted it as featuring a &quot;rare example of a dominatrix presented as a fully fledged character&quot; and that it &quot;makes very explicit the vital importance of consent and boundaries in any sadomasochistic encounter or relationship&quot;.

<doc id="846251" wikidata="Q476135" url="?curid=846251" title="United States Naval Special Warfare Command">
<text>The United States Naval Special Warfare Command (USNSWC), also known as NAVSPECWARCOM and WARCOM, is the naval component of United States Special Operations Command, the unified command that oversees and conducts the nation&#x27;s special operations and missions.

Originating in the unconventional naval units formed during World War II, WARCOM was established on 16 April 1987 at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in San Diego, California. Its mission is to provide leadership, doctrinal guidance, resources, and oversight to special operations carried out in and littoral environments. WARCOM specializes in a broad range of tactical areas, including unconventional warfare, direct action, counterterrorism, special reconnaissance, and personnel recovery.

WARCOM is organized primarily around eight Navy SEAL teams, three special boat teams, and various supporting commands, totaling about 9,200 personnel. Units can operate independently, as part of carrier battle groups and amphibious ready groups, or integrated with other U.S. special operations forces. By using the United States Navy&#x27;s ships, submarines, and overseas facilities, WARCOM forces can be deployed rapidly around the world.

== Background ==
Today&#x27;s U.S. Navy special warfare operators trace their origins to various units formed during World War II, including the Scouts and Raiders, Naval Combat Demolition Units, Office of Strategic Services Operational Swimmers, Underwater Demolition Teams, and Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons. In the Vietnam era, the Navy&#x27;s special units included separate Underwater Demolition Teams (the successors to Navy Combat Demolition Units) and SEAL teams (successors to Scouts and Raiders). In 1983, the Underwater Demolition Teams were merged into the SEAL teams.

A detailed history of Naval Special Warfare, including writings by members who have served in the various NSW units, is available at the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum website, while the facility itself has an extensive collection of related artifacts on display.

=== World War II ===
By the time the United States became involved in World War II, Adolf Hitler and the Axis forces had control over a large portion of Europe, Asia and North Africa. If the Allied forces were to stand a chance, there would have to be several full-scale landings. The U.S. Navy decided that to do the job right required sending in their own. They needed men to reconnoiter the landing beaches, take note of obstacles and defenses and ultimately guide the landing forces in. Later, during the war, the Army Engineers passed down demolition jobs to the U.S. Navy. They were to clear any obstacles and/or defenses in the nearshore area, beginning a tradition that continues today.
==== Scouts and Raiders ====
The Navy Scouts and Raiders were created before the Navy Combat Demolition Units (NCDUs). The Scouts and Raiders were first formed 15 August 1942, nine months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, from the Observer Group, a joint Marine Corps–Army–Navy unit. The Observer Group was the first unit trained in amphibious reconnaissance. They trained in inflatable boat insertions from submarines around the Chesapeake Bay and at the Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Little Creek in Virginia and in Fort Pierce, Florida. They were training for an intense clandestine mission in North Africa.

With US Marines limited to the Pacific Theatre of Operations, the Observer Group was disbanded, with the Marine Corps counterpart forming the Amphib Recon Company; the Army/Navy unit formed the Scouts and Raiders with the Army later leaving. The U.S. Navy began the Scouts and Raiders to provide reconnaissance and raiding missions to support amphibious landings. The unit utilized two men to platoon-sized operations to conduct raids and sabotage missions.

The unit continued its deployment to North Africa as planned, where they earned eight Navy Crosses. Robert Halperin, a former NFL football player and future Olympic medalist, received a Presidential Citation and the Navy Cross for his work during the amphibious landings in French Morocco. This was just the first of many war-time missions for the versatile Scouts and Raiders.

===== First group =====
The first group included Phil H. Bucklew, the &quot;Father of Naval Special Warfare&quot;, after whom the Naval Special Warfare Center building is named. Commissioned in October 1942, this group saw combat in November 1942 during Operation Torch on the North African coast. Scouts and Raiders also supported landings in Sicily, Salerno, Anzio, Normandy, and southern France.

===== Second group =====
A combined operations joint US-Australian unit, Special Service Unit No. 1 (SSU 1), was established on 7 July 1943. Its first mission, in September 1943, was at Finschafen on New Guinea. Later operations were at Gasmata, Arawe, Cape Gloucester, and the East and South coast of New Britain, all without any loss of personnel. Conflicts arose over operational matters, and the unit was dissolved.

The US Navy personnel from SSU 1 became the basis of the 7th Amphibious Scouts. They received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, mark channels with buoys, erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, blow up beach obstacles, and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats, and nearby ships. The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict, participating in more than 40 landings.

Scout landings were done at night during the new moon. The men were brought to a lagoon by submarine and came ashore with rubber paddle boats. They would bury the boats in the sand and begin recon. Their mission was to clear the area prior to the main Naval landing which would then take over the island. They stayed from three days to as long as seven days engaging in covert operations and &quot;taking no prisoners&quot;. They had learned martial arts (judo) and were armed with Thompson submachine guns, sidearms and knives. The entire Navy Scouts program was strictly volunteer, since it was considered too dangerous to order men to do this job. When the island was secured, they would transmit code to the sub, which would pick them up the next night. A typical loss would be 12 men going in and 3–5 coming back alive. Sometimes only one would come back.

===== Third group =====
The third Scout and Raiders organization deployed to fight with the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO) in China. Admiral Ernest J. King ordered that 120 officers and 900 enlisted sailors be trained for &quot;Amphibious Roger&quot; at the Amphibious Roger school at Fort Pierce, Florida in order to support this mission. They formed the core of what was envisioned as a &quot;guerrilla amphibious organization of Americans and Chinese operating from coastal waters, lakes and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans.&quot; Elements of the third Scouts and Raiders saw active service conducting surveys of the upper Yangtze River in the spring of 1945 and, disguised as coolies, conducting a detailed three-month survey of the Chinese coast from Shanghai to Kitchioh Wan, near Hong Kong. The majority of the force remained garrisoned at Camp Knox in Calcutta, India.

=== Naval Combat Demolition Units ===

In September 1942, 17 Navy salvage personnel arrived at ATB Little Creek, Virginia for a one-week concentrated course on demolitions, explosive cable cutting and commando raiding techniques. The units were organised into six-man teams of an officer, a petty officer and four seamen using a seven-man LCRS inflatable boat to carry their explosives and gear.

On 10 November 1942, this first combat demolition unit succeeded in cutting a cable and net barrier across the Wadi Sebou River during Operation Torch in North Africa. Their actions enabled to traverse the river and insert Army Rangers, who proceeded to capture the Port Lyautey aerodrome.

Plans for a massive cross-channel invasion of Europe had begun and intelligence indicated that the Germans were placing extensive underwater obstacles on the beaches at Normandy. On 7 May 1943, Lieutenant Commander Draper L. Kauffman, &quot;The Father of Naval Combat Demolition,&quot; was directed to set up a school and train people to eliminate obstacles on an enemy-held beach prior to an invasion.
On 6 June 1943, LCDR Kaufmann established Naval Combat Demolition Unit training at Fort Pierce. By April 1944, a total of 34 NCDUs were deployed to England in preparation for Operation OVERLORD, the amphibious landing at Normandy.

On 6 June 1944, in the face of great adversity, the NCDUs at Omaha Beach managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses. The NCDUs suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded, a casualty rate of 52%. Meanwhile, the NCDUs at Utah Beach met less intense enemy fire. They cleared of beach in two hours, another by the afternoon. Casualties at Utah Beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded. During Operation OVERLORD, not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives.

In August 1944, NCDUs from Utah Beach participated in the landings in southern France, the last amphibious operation in the European Theater of Operations.
NCDUs also operated in the Pacific theater. NCDU 2, under LTjg Frank Kaine, after whom the Naval Special Warfare Command building is named, and NCDU 3 under LTjg Lloyd Anderson, formed the nucleus of six NCDUs that served with the Seventh Amphibious Force tasked with clearing boat channels after the landings from Biak to Borneo.

=== OSS Operational Swimmers ===
Some of the earliest World War II predecessors of the SEALs were the Operational Swimmers of the Office of Strategic Services, or OSS. Many present day SEAL missions were first assigned to them.
The OSS specialized in special operations, dropping operatives behind enemy lines to engage in organized guerrilla warfare as well as to gather information on such things as enemy resources and troop movements.

British Combined Operations veteran Lt Cdr Wooley, of the Royal Navy, was placed in charge of the OSS Maritime Unit in June 1943.
Their training started in November 1943 at Camp Pendleton, California, moved to Santa Catalina Island, California in January 1944, and finally moved to the warmer waters of The Bahamas in March 1944. Within the U.S. military, they pioneered flexible swimfins and diving masks, closed-circuit diving equipment (under the direction of Dr. Chris Lambertsen), the use of Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (a type of submersible), and combat swimming and limpet mine attacks.

In May 1944, General Donovan, the head of the OSS, divided the unit into groups. He loaned Group 1, under Lieutenant Arthur Choate Jr., to Admiral Nimitz, as a way to introduce the OSS into the Pacific theater. They became part of UDT-10 in July 1944, with Lt. Commander Choate commanding the unit. Five OSS men participated in the very first UDT submarine operation with the in the Caroline Islands in August 1944.

===Beach Jumpers===

Beach Jumper Unit One was formed at the Amphibious Training Base at Camp Bradford, Virginia on 16 March 1943 for deception operations to simulate large scale amphibious raids and invasions.

=== Underwater Demolition Teams ===
On 23 November 1943, the U.S. Marine landing and the subsequent battle at Tarawa Atoll emphasized the need for hydrographic reconnaissance and underwater demolition of obstacles prior to any amphibious landing. After Tarawa, 30 officers and 150 enlisted men were moved to the Waimānalo Amphibious Training Base to form the nucleus of a demolition training program. This group became Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) One and Two.

The UDTs saw their first combat on 31 January 1944, during Operation Flintlock in the Marshall Islands. FLINTLOCK became the real catalyst for the UDT training program in the Pacific Theater. In February 1944, the Naval Combat Demolition Training and Experimental Base was established at Kīhei, Maui, next to the Amphibious Base at Kamaole. Eventually, 34 UDT teams were established. Wearing swim suits, fins, and dive masks on combat operations, these &quot;Naked Warriors&quot; saw action across the Pacific in every major amphibious landing including: Eniwetok, Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Angaur, Ulithi, Peleliu, Leyte, Lingayen Gulf, Zambales, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Labuan, Brunei Bay, and on 4 July 1945 at Balikpapan on Borneo, which was the last UDT demolition operation of the war.

The rapid demobilization at the conclusion of the war reduced the number of active duty UDTs to two on each coast with a complement of seven officers and 45 enlisted men each.

The Korean War began on 25 June 1950, when the North Korean army invaded South Korea. Beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from UDT 3, UDT participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men.
As part of the Special Operations Group, or SOG, UDTs successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast. On 15 September 1950, UDTs supported Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing at Incheon. UDT 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing.

In October 1950, UDTs supported mine-clearing operations in Wonsan Harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers. On 12 October 1950, two U.S. minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDTs rescued 25 sailors.

The UDT&#x27;s entered the Vietnam War in 1958, UDTs delivered small watercraft far up the Mekong River into Laos. In 1961, naval advisers started training South Vietnamese personnel in South Vietnam. The men were called the &quot;Liên Đoàn Người Nhái&quot; (LDNN) or Vietnamese Frogmen, which translates as &quot;Frogmen Team.&quot;

UDT teams carried out hydrographic surveys in South Vietnam&#x27;s coastal waters and reconnaissance missions of harbors, beaches and rivers often under hazardous conditions and enemy fire.

Later, the UDTs supported the Amphibious Ready Groups operating on South Vietnam&#x27;s rivers creating a River Patrol Force (Task Force 116) of UDT&#x27;s that operated River Patrol Boats. UDTs manned riverine patrol craft and help went ashore to demolish obstacles and enemy bunkers. They operated throughout South Vietnam, from the Mekong Delta (Sea Float), the Parrot&#x27;s Beak and French canal AO&#x27;s through I Corps and the Song Cui Dai estuary south of Da Nang. UDT&#x27;s provided infiltration and extraction for assigned SEAL team assault squads along the rivers.

== Navy SEALs and SWCC ==
Naval Special Warfare personnel make up less than one percent of U.S. Navy personnel. Navy Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) and Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) units operate across the spectrum of conflict and in operations other than war in a controlled manner; their ability to provide real time intelligence and &quot;eyes on target&quot;, offer decision makers immediate options in the face of rapidly changing world crises.

=== SEALs ===
SEALs are Special Operations Command&#x27;s force-of-choice to conduct small-unit maritime military operations which originate from, and return to a river, ocean, swamp, delta or coastline. This littoral capability is considered more important now than ever, as half the world&#x27;s infrastructure and population is located within one mile (1.6 km) of an ocean or river.

Responding to President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s desire for the Services to develop an Unconventional Warfare (UW) capability, the U.S. Navy established SEAL Team One and SEAL Team Two in January 1962. Formed entirely with personnel from Underwater Demolition Teams, the SEALs mission was to conduct counter guerrilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments.
Navy SEALs have distinguished themselves as an individually reliable, collectively disciplined and highly skilled maritime force. Because of the dangers inherent in NSW, prospective SEALs go through what is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training in the world. The intense physical and mental conditioning it takes to become a SEAL begins at Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training.

SEAL candidates begin BUD/S training at the Naval Special Warfare Center, NAB Coronado, California. This six-month course of instruction focuses on physical conditioning, small boat handling, diving physics, basic diving techniques, land warfare, weapons, demolitions, communications, and reconnaissance.
* First Phase trains, develops, and assesses SEAL candidates in physical conditioning, water competency, teamwork, and mental tenacity.
* Second (Diving) Phase trains, develops, and qualifies SEAL candidates as competent basic combat swimmers. During this period, physical training continues and becomes even more intensive. Emphasis is placed on long distance underwater dives with the goal of training students to become basic combat divers, using swimming and diving techniques as a means of transportation from their launch point to their combat objective. This is a skill that separates SEALs from all other Special Operations forces.
* Third Phase trains, develops, and qualifies SEAL candidates in basic weapons, demolition, and small unit tactics. Third Phase concentrates on teaching land navigation, small-unit tactics, patrolling techniques, rappelling, marksmanship, and military explosives. The final three and a half weeks of Third Phase are spent at NALF San Clemente Island, where students apply all the techniques they have acquired during training.

==== SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams ====

SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams&#x27; (SDVT) historical roots began during WWII with the earliest human torpedoes to see use: Maiale, used by Italy&#x27;s Decima Flottiglia MAS, and Chariots, used by British commando frogmen. Naval Special Warfare entered the wet submersible field in the 1960s when the Coastal Systems Center in Panama City, Florida developed the Mark 7, a free-flooding SDV of the type used today, and the first SDV to be used in the fleet. The Mark 8 and 9 followed in the late 1970s.

Today&#x27;s Mark 8 Mod 1 provides NSW with an unprecedented capability that combines the attributes of clandestine underwater mobility and the combat swimmer. The Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) program that would have provided NSW a new (dry) submersible for long range infiltration missions was abandoned in 2009. However, news reports have stated that USSOCOM have purchased a new dry SEAL Delivery Vehicle called the Dry Combat Submersible and will be become operational around 2018/2019.

=== Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen ===
The exclusive mission of Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) operators is to expertly drive and provide large-caliber gunfire support on specialized high-tech, high-speed, and low-profile Surface Combatant Craft to secretly infiltrate and exfiltrate Navy SEALs on Special Operations missions worldwide. These missions include direct action on land, sea, coastline or rivers (such as strikes, captures, and ship take downs by Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure), special reconnaissance, coastal patrol and interdiction of suspect ships and surface craft, counter-terrorism operations, riverine warfare, deception operations, search and rescue operations, and foreign internal defense missions. Although SEALs and SWCC undergo different training programs, both are focused on special operations in maritime environments. The SWCC program includes extensive training on craft and weapons tactics, techniques, and procedures. Like SEALs, SWCC must show physical fitness, possess strong motivation, be combat focused, and maintain responsiveness in high stress situations.

The SWCC designation is a relatively new Naval Special Warfare career path that is independent of the regular line Navy. Today&#x27;s Special Boat Teams have their origins in the PT boats of WWII and the &quot;Brown Water&quot; naval force onset of the Vietnam War in 1965 that later birthed the River Patrol Force (Task Force 116) of UDT&#x27;s and various sailors that supported SEALs along the rivers. Patrol Coastal and Patrol Torpedo ships are the ancestors of today&#x27;s s and Mark V Special Operations Craft.

&lt;br&gt;
== Global War on Terror ==
NSW is committed to combating the global terrorist threats. In addition to being experts in special reconnaissance and direct action missions, the skill sets needed to combat terrorism; NSW is postured to fight a dispersed enemy on their territory. NSW forces can operate from forward-deployed Navy ships, submarines and aviation mobility platforms as well as overseas bases and its own overseas units.

=== War in Afghanistan ===
In response to the attacks on America 11 September 2001, Naval Special Warfare forces put operators on the ground in Afghanistan in October. The first military flag officer to set foot in Afghanistan was a Navy SEAL, Rear Admiral Albert Calland, in charge of Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT), which was responsible for all special operations for Central Command. Additionally, a Navy SEAL captain commanded Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) South. Commonly referred to as Task Force K-Bar, the task force included Navy, Army, Air Force and Coalition Special Operations forces. During Operation Enduring Freedom, NSW forces carried out more than 75 special reconnaissance and direct action missions, destroying more than 500,000 pounds of explosives and weapons; positively identifying enemy personnel and conducting Leadership Interdiction Operations in the search for terrorists trying to escape by seagoing vessels.

Operation Red Wings, a counter insurgent mission in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, involved four Navy SEALs and took place on 28 June 2005. The SEALs were on a mission to try to find a key Taliban leader. However, goat herders stumbled upon their hiding place and alerted local Taliban fighters, and they were subsequently surrounded by Taliban forces. The four SEALs requested back up after the Taliban had surrounded them. In the attempt to rescue the four SEALs on the ground a Boeing CH-47 Chinook containing members of SEAL delivery team one and several Army &quot;Nightstalker&quot; pilots was shot down. At the time, this was the biggest single loss of life for Naval Special Warfare forces since World War II. A firefight ensued, killing three SEALs. The fourth, Marcus Luttrell, was protected by local villagers and later rescued by the U.S. military. The team leader, SEAL Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

SEAL Senior Chief Petty Officer Dan Healy was awarded the Bronze Star with Combat &quot;V&quot; for Valor, Purple Heart, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal, posthumously.

On the night of 1–2 May 2011, operators from Red Squadron of U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) (aka &quot;SEAL Team 6&quot;) raided the compound of Osama bin-Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, killing the al-Qaeda leader and four others. The operation was codenamed &quot;Neptune Spear&quot; in reference to the SEAL insignia&#x27;s trident.

=== Iraq War ===
Naval Special Warfare has played a significant role in Operation Iraqi Freedom, employing the largest number of SEALs and SWCCs in its history. NSW forces were instrumental in numerous special reconnaissance and direct action missions including the securing of the southern oil infrastructures of the Al Faw peninsula and the off-shore gas and oil terminals; the clearing of the Khawr Abd Allah and Khawr az-Zubayr waterways that enabled humanitarian aid to be delivered to the vital port city of Umm Qasr; reconnaissance of the Shatt al-Arab waterway; capture of high-value targets, raids on suspected chemical, biological and radiological sites; and the first POW rescue since WWII. Additionally, NSW is also fighting the war on terrorism in other global hot spots including the Philippines and the Horn of Africa.
SEAL Petty Officer Second Class Michael A. Monsoor was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Ramadi, Iraq.

<text>Edward Singleton Holden (November 5, 1846 – March 16, 1914) was an American astronomer and the fifth president of the University of California.

==Early years==
He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1846 to Edward and Sarah Frances (Singleton) Holden. From 1862 to 1866, he attended Washington University in St. Louis, where he obtained a B.S. degree. He later trained at West Point in the class of 1870.

==Career==
In 1873 he became professor of mathematics at the US Naval Observatory, where he made a favorable impression on Simon Newcomb. On August 28, 1877, a few days after Asaph Hall discovered the moons of Mars Deimos and Phobos, he claimed to have found a third satellite of Mars. Further analysis showed large mistakes in his observations.
He was director of Washburn Observatory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1881 to 1885. He was elected a member of both the American National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1885. He discovered a total of 22 NGC objects during his work at Washburn Observatory.

Holden was president of the University of California from 1885 until 1888, and the first director of the Lick Observatory from 1888 until the end of 1897. He resigned as a result of internal dissent over his management among his subordinates. While at the Lick Observatory, he was the founder of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and its first president (1889–1891). He also became a member of the American Philosophical Society. Holden was awarded five honorary degrees: an M.A. degree from Washington University in 1879,
an LL.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1886, an LL.D. from Columbia University in 1887, a Sc.D. from the University of the Pacific in 1896 and a Litt.D. from Fordham College in 1910.

In 1901, Holden became the librarian of the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he remained until his death. He was buried at the West Point Cemetery on March 18, 1914.

==Works==
He wrote many books on popular science (and on other subjects, such as flags and heraldry), including science books intended for children, for example:
* On the Mughal Emperors.
* &quot;Real Things In Nature. A Reading Book of Science for American Boys and Girls&quot;, 1916.

==Legacy==
Holden was a founding member of the Cosmos Club.

The asteroid 872 Holda, the crater Holden on the Moon and the crater Holden on Mars are all named in his honor.

==Family==
His cousin George Phillips Bond was director of Harvard College Observatory. His grandson, also named Edward Singleton Holden, was a well known inventor with numerous patents to his name. He is credited with designing the rolled stainless steel gauge present in most modern fire extinguishers.

<text>Giovanni de Sanctis (born 1949) is an Italian astronomer and discoverer of minor planets at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino (Astronomical Observatory of Turin) in Turin, Italy. His name is sometimes spelt DeSanctis, particularly in the Minor Planet Circulars. The Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of 42 numbered minor planets, most of which he discovered at ESO&#x27;s La Silla site in northern Chile in the early 1980s.

The Vestian asteroid 3268 De Sanctis was named by Henri Debehogne in honor of his co-discoverer. Naming citation was published on 22 June 1986 ().
