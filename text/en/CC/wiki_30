<text>Cadbury Castle is a Bronze and Iron Age hillfort in the civil parish of South Cadbury in the English county of Somerset. It is a scheduled monument and has been associated with King Arthur&#x27;s legendary court at Camelot.

The hillfort is formed by a plateau surrounded by ramparts on the surrounding slopes of the limestone Cadbury Hill. The site has been excavated in the late 19th and early 20th century by James Bennett and Harold St George Gray. More recent examination of the site was conducted in the 1960s by Leslie Alcock and since 1992 by the South Cadbury Environs Project. These have revealed artifacts from human occupation and use from the Neolithic through the Bronze and Iron Ages. The site was reused by the Roman forces and again from c. 470 until some time after 580. In the 11th century, it temporarily housed a Saxon mint. Evidence of various buildings at the site has been unearthed, including a &quot;Great Hall&quot;, round and rectangular house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small rectangular temples or shrines.

==Etymology==
The suffix &quot;-bury&quot; (from &quot;byrig,&quot; an Anglo-Saxon word meaning &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;town&quot;) is frequently, but not exclusively, used to refer to hill-forts. The first part of the name may come from the River Cam, as with the nearby villages of West Camel and Queen Camel. Other scholars suggest a derivation from some figure named &quot;Cador&quot; or &quot;Cada&quot;. It is one of three sites in Somerset to include the Cadbury name, the others being Cadbury Camp, near Tickenham, and Cadbury Hill, which is also known as Cadbury-Congresbury to distinguish it from the other sites.

==Background==
Hillforts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around the start of the 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.

Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that
==Location==
Cadbury Castle is located north east of Yeovil. It stands on the summit of Cadbury Hill, a limestone hill situated on the southern edge of the Somerset Levels, with flat lowland to the north. The summit is above sea-level on lias stone.

The hill is surrounded by terraced earthwork banks and ditches and a stand of trees. On the north west and south sides there are four ramparts, with two remaining on the east. The summit plateau covers , and is surrounded by the inner bank which is long. The hill fort is overlooked by Sigwells, a rural plateau rich in archaeological remains. Due to scrub and tree growth the site has been added to the Heritage at Risk Register.
Further information on the dig and hill fort can be found a short walk down the road on Somerset Heritage Panels which have been erected in the local pub The Camelot Inn.

== History ==

===Early occupation of the site===

The earliest settlement on the site is represented by pits and post holes dated with Neolithic pottery and flints. These are the remains of a small agricultural settlement which was unenclosed. Bones recovered from the site have been radiocarbon dated to 3500 and 3300 BC. A bank under the later Iron Age defences is likely to be a lynchet or terrace derived from early ploughing of the hilltop. The site was also occupied in the Late Bronze Age, from which ovens have been identified. Radical revisions of the Bronze Age archaeology on the lower slopes resulted from discoveries during excavations and survey work by the South Cadbury Environs Project. Finds include the first Bronze Age shield from an excavation in northwest Europe, an example of the distinctive Yetholm-type. The shield dates from the period 1350–1150 BC. A metal-working building and associated enclosure were discovered south east of the hillfort, roughly contemporary with the period of manufacture. Some of the diagnostic pottery for the early hases of the site were discovered by Mary Harfield.

Human occupation continued throughout the Iron Age. A stone enclosure was constructed around 300 BC with timber revetting, and ploughing ceased within the hilltop site. Excavations have shown the signs of four and six post rectangular buildings which were gradually replaced with roundhouses. Large ramparts and elaborate timber defences were constructed and refortified over the following centuries. Excavation revealed round and rectangular house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small rectangular temples or shrines, indicating permanent oppidum-like occupation. Excavations were undertaken by local clergyman James Bennett in 1890 and Harold St George Gray in 1913, followed by major work led by archaeologist Leslie Alcock from 1966 to 1970. He identified a long sequence of occupation on the site and many of the finds are displayed in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The finds from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, exploring the ramparts and southwestern gate structure, represent one of the deepest and most complex Iron Age stratigraphic sequences excavated in southern Britain.

===Castle===
During the first century BC, additional lines of bank and ditch were constructed, turning it into a hill fort which is now known as the &quot;castle&quot;. There is evidence that the fort was violently taken around AD 43 and that the defences were further slighted later in the first century after the construction of a Roman army barracks on the hilltop. Excavations of the southwest gate in 1968 and 1969 revealed evidence for one or more severe violent episodes associated with weaponry and destruction by fire. Leslie Alcock believed this to have been dated to around AD 70, whereas Richard Tabor argues for a date associated with the initial invasion around AD 43 or 44. Michael Havinden states that it was the site of vigorous resistance by the Durotriges and Dobunni to the second Augusta Legion under the command of Vespasian. There was significant activity at the site during the late third and fourth centuries, which may have included the construction of a Romano-British temple.

===Post-Roman occupation===
Following the withdrawal of the Roman administration, the site is thought to have been in use from until some time after 580. Alcock revealed a substantial &quot;Great Hall&quot; and showed that the innermost Iron Age defences had been refortified, providing a defended site double the size of any other known fort of the period. Shards of pottery from the eastern Mediterranean were also found from this period, indicating wide trade links. It therefore seems probable that it was the chief fort of a major Brythonic ruler, with his family, his warband, servants, and horses.
Between 1010 and 1020, the hill was reoccupied for use as a temporary Saxon mint, standing in for that at Ilchester.

===Medieval period===
According to the Domesday Book, Cadbury Castle appears to have been part of the feudal barony of North Cadbury held by Turstin FitzRolf in 1086.
Some small-scale fortification of the site may also have occurred in the 13th century.

==Arthurian interpretation==
Local tradition, first written down by John Leland in 1542, holds that Cadbury Castle was King Arthur&#x27;s Camelot. The site and the Great Hall are extensive, and the writer Geoffrey Ashe argued that it was the base for the Arthur of history. His opinion has not been widely accepted by students of the period.

Militarily, the location makes sense as a place where refugees and the southwestern Brythons of Dumnonia could have defended themselves against attacks from the east. If Arthur was indeed conceived at Tintagel, as tradition asserts, he may have been a prince of Dumnonia and used Cadbury as a stronghold on his eastern frontier.

==South Cadbury Environs Project==

The recent work on the archaeology of the site and the surrounding area has been carried out by the South Cadbury Environs Project. Since 1992 the project team, which included local volunteers South East Somerset Archaeological and Historical Society and the Yeovil Archaeology and Local History Society, have carried out geophysical surveys including gradiometry and electrical resistivity tomography, ploughzone sampling, test pits, deeper excavations and geographic information system (GIS) approaches. The project had input from academics and archaeologists from the universities of Bristol, Glasgow, Birmingham and Oxford, funded by the Leverhulme Trust and Arts and Humanities Research Council. The project studies the castle and surrounding area up to away, using landscape sampling,

<text>The Allen Kingston was an American automobile manufactured from 1907 to 1909 by the New York Car &amp; Truck Company for motor agent Walter C. Allen. The car was designed on European lines, featuring runningboard-mounted spare tires and an early boat-tailed body, but was meant for American manufacture to circumvent the 45% duty on imported cars. These 45 hp 7400 cc cars were advertised as combining &quot;the best features of the Fiat, the Renault and the Mercedes in a harmonious new construction of the highest quality&quot;.

<doc id="852908" wikidata="Q2354471" url="?curid=852908" title="Sheldon Harnick">
<text>Sheldon Mayer Harnick (April 30, 1924 – June 23, 2023) was an American lyricist and songwriter best known for his collaborations with composer Jerry Bock on musicals such as &quot;Fiorello!&quot;, &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

==Early life==
Sheldon Mayer Harnick was born to American Jewish parents Esther (Kanter) and Harry M. Harnick, a dentist, in Chicago on April 30, 1924. He grew up in the Chicago neighborhood of Portage Park. He took an interest in music from an early age, playing the violin as a child. He began writing music while a student at Carl Schurz High School.

==Musical career==
After serving in the U.S. Army, Harnick graduated from the Northwestern University School of Music (1946–1949) with a Bachelor of Music degree, and worked with various orchestras in the Chicago area. He then moved to New York City and wrote for many musicals and revues. He was friends with Charlotte Rae from college, and he went to see her one night at the Village Vanguard where she was singing a revue. Yip Harburg, who was one of Harnick&#x27;s idols, heard she was singing a song of his and decided to come. He told Harnick that he enjoyed his writing, and urged him to continue. Harburg advised Harnick to work with a large number of composers. He also counseled him to write character and comic songs, not ballads, for Broadway. Harnick’s composition &quot;The Merry Minuet&quot; was popularized by The Kingston Trio. 

Around 1956, Harnick met Jerry Bock, forming &quot;what is arguably the most important musical partnership of the &#x27;60s.&quot; Their first musical was &quot;The Body Beautiful&quot;, running for only 60 performances in 1958, but &quot;Fiorello!&quot; (1959) ran for 795 performances and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama as well as the Tony Award for Best Musical. &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1964) &quot;became one of the most cherished of all Broadway musicals.&quot; Other Broadway successes for Harnick included &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (1963), &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Rothschilds&quot; (1970).

Harnick wrote the libretto for the opera &quot;Coyote Tales&quot;, with music by Henry Mollicone, which received its world premiere at the Lyric Opera of Kansas City in March 1998. He wrote the book, music and lyrics to the musical &quot;Dragons&quot;, which was performed in 2003 at the Luna Stage in Montclair, New Jersey. He wrote the lyrics and co-wrote the book with Norton Juster for the musical &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;, based on the book by Juster. The musical premiered at the Kennedy Center in 2007.

Harnick released the album &quot;Sheldon Harnick: Hidden Treasures (1949–2013)&quot; in 2014, which includes recordings of song demos and pieces cut from Broadway shows from his private collection. In 2020, Harnick worked on a musical adaptation of the Soviet play &quot;The Dragon&quot; by Evgeny Schwartz.

==Personal life==
Harnick was married three times. His 1950 marriage to Mary Boatner was annulled in 1957. His marriage to Elaine May lasted only a year, from 1962 until their divorce in 1963. In 1965, he married Margery Grey. They had two children and lived in an apartment at The Beresford, a building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Harnick died there on June 23, 2023, aged 99.

<doc id="852909" wikidata="Q1246792" url="?curid=852909" title="Phetchabun Mountains">
<text>The Phetchabun mountains (, , ) are a mountain massif in Phetchabun, Phitsanulok, Loei and Chaiyaphum Provinces, Thailand. It consists of two parallel mountain chains, with the valley of the Pa Sak River in the middle.

The strange rock formations of Phu Hin Rong Kla and fields where the Siam tulip flower (&quot;Curcuma alismatifolia&quot;), known as &quot;dok krachiao&quot; (ดอกกระเจียว) in Thai, grows wild are some of the characteristics of the Phetchabun Mountains.

==Geography==
The mountain system as a whole is named after the city of Phetchabun which lies within the mountainous area. To the south and southeast lie the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains. Both sections of the Phetchabun massif are parallel and of a similar length, extending in a roughly north-south direction. The western range is a prolongation of the southern end of the Luang Prabang Range. The eastern range separates the broad Chao Phraya river basin of central Thailand from the Khorat Plateau of Isan. The northward-flowing Loei River, a tributary of the Mekong, has its sources in the eastern range.

The southern limit of the Phetchabun massif is not clearly defined, roughly beginning south of the 16th parallel north where both ranges become a group of scattered mountains of lesser height, rarely surpassing 800 m, extending southwards. The eastern mountain chain is mentioned as the Phang Hoei Range in some geographical works, a name that encompasses the whole northern section of the Dong Phaya Yen mountain system, for Khao Phang Hoei is a 1,008 m high summit west of Chaiyaphum town, beyond the southern end of the Phetchabun Range proper in the northern Dong Phaya Yen.

The highest elevation of the Phetchabun mountains is 1,794 m high Phu Thap Boek. Other important peaks are Khao Nam Ko Yai, Phu Kradueng, Phu Luang, Phu Ruea, and Phu Lom Lo.

Geologically, the mountains consist of limestone, interfused with slate and sandstone. A few igneous rocks are also found: granite, basalt and porphyry.

==History==
Historically the long mountainous system of the Phetchabun-Dong Phaya Yen-Sankamphaeng formed a barrier between Isan and the Central Plain. Until recently few roads crossed the system.

During the period between 1968-1982 the area around 1,143 m high Khao Kho (เขาค้อ) and Phu Hin Rong Kla became an occasional battleground. At that time insurgents of the Communist Party of Thailand established their base in hidden mountain locations and fought skirmishes against the Thai Army.

==Protected areas==
Several protected areas, including national parks, forest parks and wildlife reserves are located in these mountains. In 2005 these were accepted by the UNESCO as a possible future addition to the World Heritage list.
Besides these protected areas, some forest parks are also located within the area of the range:
*Phu Hin Rong Kla National Park
*Namtok Chat Trakan National Park,
*Nam Nao National Park
*Phu Ruea National Park
*Phu Kradueng National Park
*Suan Hin Pha Ngam Park
*Phu Pha Man National Park
*Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary
*Thung Salaeng Luang National Park
*Tat Mok National Park, located at the boundary of the Phetchabun mountain range with the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains.

<text>Herttoniemi () is an East Helsinki neighbourhood and a suburb of Helsinki, the Finnish capital.

==Geography==
Located about east of the city centre, Herttoniemi can be reached by the Helsinki Metro in 10 minutes, or by road via the Itäväylä arterial road (Finnish regional road no. 170) running from the inner city area through the eastern suburbs.

Herttoniemi comprises four distinct areas:
*Länsi-Herttoniemi (West Herttoniemi)
*Roihuvuori, formerly Itä-Herttoniemi (East Herttoniemi)
*Herttoniemenranta (Herttoniemi Harbour)
*Herttoniemi industrial area

==History==
Herttoniemi has been inhabited for a long time. One of Helsinki&#x27;s Bronze Age graves has been found near the Herttoniemi metro station. Some Finnish place names have also survived in Herttoniemi, which testify that Tavastians have used the area and inhabited it before Swedes colonized Uusimaa. In the light of place names, a permanent settlement by Tavastians occurred possibly as early as the 12th century.

The village of Herttoniemi was one of the oldest in the Helsinge Parish. The Herttoniemi manor is the oldest in eastern Helsinki, and it belonged to the Jägerhorn family already in the 16th century. When Count Augustin Ehrensvärd bought the estate in 1752, the lands of the manor extended to Puotila in the east and to Viikki and Malmi in the north. The area of Myllypuro also belonged to the lands owned by Ehrensvärd. Later, the manor and its lands belonged to Carl Olof Cronstedt, a famous hero of the Battle of Svensksund and the last commandant of Viapori during the Swedish reign. In addition to the Herttoniemi manor, the Ströms manor is also located in this area.

The last owner of the Herttoniemi manor, Councillor of agriculture John Bergbom began to rent out plots of the manor lands in 1880 to people who would build villas in the area. The leases were made for 50 years. There would eventually be 70 of such villas in the area. The area of the villas extended from Herttoniemenranta all the way to Fastholma. The villas were inhabited by members of the nobility, by factory owners, businessmen and politicians. The arrived here by steam boats from the city. The travelling time was around 20 minutes. The villas of the wealthy people were in the southern part of the area, but in the north, in the Fastholma area, the villas were inhabited by people of the working class. The latter sometimes had cows in their yards.

The area formed a densely populated community in 1917, although already the year before, that is, in 1916, Bergbom sold the area to a company which was supposed to build a private port and an industrial area in the lands it had acquired. The process of buying back of the villas now began. However, the lands were acquired by the city of Helsinki in 1919, and the development of the community was halted, and no bylaws were written for the community. Almost 30 of the villas were now acquired by the city. They were rented out to clerks of the city, although some were also rented out for year-round use, and some to associations.

The beginning of the end began in the 1930s, when the city began to build an oil terminal in Herttoniemi and a railway line to link it with the existing railway system of the country. The terminal and industrial areas were to have a street network and plans for construction were adopted, for the terminal in 1936 and for the industrial area in 1943. Also a highway was built across the area, where Itäväylä now is located. At that time, some of the villas were torn down, although the biggest changes were to take place only after the war.

By 2020, only one of villas has survived, and many villas seem to have disappeared without even photographs existing of them, says second hand book seller, historian and writer Jan Strang, who is planning to write a book of the villas.

Herttoniemi was annexed to Helsinki in the Great annexation of Helsinki in 1946. The construction of new neighbourhoods was begun in the annexed areas, Herttoniemi being the first and biggest of these neighbourhoods. Myllypuro was originally part of Herttoniemi, but it was assigned to Vartiokylä, instead, in 1959.

The harbour and the oil depot in Herttoniemi were demolished in the 1990s and redeveloped into a residential area and marina called Herttoniemenranta.

Some fortifications of Krepost Sveaborg can be found in Herttoniemi, dating to World War I.

<doc id="852927" wikidata="Q19803" url="?curid=852927" title="Touch-and-go landing">
<text>In aviation, a touch-and-go landing (TGL) or circuit and bump is a maneuver that is common when learning to fly a fixed-wing aircraft. It involves landing on a runway and taking off again without coming to a full stop. Usually the pilot then circles the airport in a defined pattern known as a circuit and repeats the maneuver. This allows many landings to be practiced in a short time.

If the pilot brings the aircraft to a full stop before taking off again, it is known as a &quot;stop-and-go&quot;. If the aircraft&#x27;s wheels do not touch the ground, it is known as a &quot;low pass&quot;. Both a touch-and-go landing and a low pass are types of go-around. An unplanned touch-and-go landing is also called a &quot;rejected landing&quot; or &quot;balked landing&quot;.

Touch-and-go landings can perform a crucial safety role when a plane lands with not enough space to come to a complete stop, but has enough space to accelerate and take off again.

==Standard procedure==
In a normal landing, the pilot flies the traffic pattern and establishes the aircraft on final approach. As the aircraft crosses the threshold of the runway the pilot executes the landing flare, touches the aircraft down, and immediately applies braking, ground spoilers, and (if available) reverse thrust until the aircraft has decelerated enough to exit onto a taxiway. In a touch-and-go landing, after the wheels are down, the pilot does not apply the brakes but instead increases the engine power to full, partially retracts the flaps, accelerates back to rotation speed, and lifts off again. 

At a towered airport, the pilot must receive ATC permission to perform a touch-and-go landing by requesting it by name or as &quot;the option,&quot; which allows the pilot to perform a touch-and-go, stop-and-go, low approach, full-stop landing or go-around as desired.

At a non-towered airport, the pilot announces position and intent over the CTAF or UNICOM radio frequency to coordinate the flow of local air traffic with any other pilots.

==Debate over role in flight instruction==

Some flight instructors believe touch-and-gos should not be heavily used, if at all, with student pilots. They argue that this procedure results in less attention to learning to land properly, and thus creates safety problems. They note that neither the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s Practical Test Standards nor its Airplane Flying Handbook discusses touch-and-gos.

Instructors who favor the use of touch-and-gos contend that it makes it possible to practice more landings per hour of instruction. Students doing touch-and-gos find it easier to master landing, particularly the final stage known as landing flare, which is often difficult to learn. Preparing to take off while landing is a necessary safety skill, they add, because any pilot must be able to do it in order to reject a landing.

==Commercial aviation==
As a result of the Australian government&#x27;s Two Airlines Policy, airlines other than Ansett Australia and Trans Australia Airlines were not permitted to operate routes directly between major cities. To circumvent this policy, East-West Airlines would perform touch-and-go landings in smaller cities along the way. For instance, East-West&#x27;s Melbourne to Sydney route included a touch-and-go landing at Albury Airport, on the border of New South Wales and Victoria.

==Carrier aviation==
In the United States Navy, touch-and-go landings are part of training for carrier pilots. If they have been away from a carrier for 29 days, they must do practice on a land runway and then do so at sea within 10 days. Before a carrier goes on patrol, pilots will conduct training. For example, before left on its summer 2016 patrol, it planned to conduct 4200 touch-and-go landings.

<doc id="852930" wikidata="Q486385" url="?curid=852930" title="Anarchy, State, and Utopia">
<text>Anarchy, State, and Utopia is a 1974 book by the American political philosopher Robert Nozick. It won the 1975 US National Book Award in category Philosophy and Religion, has been translated into 11 languages, and was named one of the &quot;100 most influential books since the war&quot; (1945–1995) by the UK &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;.

In opposition to &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971) by John Rawls, and in debate with Michael Walzer, Nozick argues in favor of a minimal state, &quot;limited to the narrow functions of protection against force, theft, fraud, enforcement of contracts, and so on.&quot; When a state takes on more responsibilities than these, Nozick argues, rights will be violated. To support the idea of the minimal state, Nozick presents an argument that illustrates how the minimalist state arises naturally from a Lockean state of nature and how any expansion of state power past this minimalist threshold is unjustified.

==Summary==

Nozick&#x27;s entitlement theory, which sees humans as ends in themselves and justifies redistribution of goods only on condition of consent, is a key aspect of &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;. It is influenced by John Locke, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Hayek.

The book also contains a vigorous defense of minarchist libertarianism against more extreme views, such as anarcho-capitalism (in which there is &quot;no&quot; state). Nozick argues that anarcho-capitalism would inevitably transform into a minarchist state, even without violating any of its own non-aggression principles, through the eventual emergence of a single locally dominant private defense and judicial agency that it is in everyone&#x27;s interests to align with because other agencies are unable to effectively compete against the advantages of the agency with majority coverage. Therefore, even to the extent that the anarcho-capitalist theory is correct, it results in a single, private, protective agency that is itself a de facto &quot;state&quot;. Thus anarcho-capitalism may only exist for a limited period before a minimalist state emerges.

===Philosophical activity===
The preface of &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; contains a passage about &quot;the usual manner of presenting philosophical work&quot;—i.e., its presentation as though it were the absolute final word on its subject. Nozick believes that philosophers are really more modest than that and aware of their works&#x27; weaknesses. Yet a form of philosophical activity persists which &quot;feels like pushing and shoving things to fit into some fixed perimeter of specified shape.&quot; The bulges are masked or the cause of the bulge is thrown &quot;far&quot; away so that no one will notice. Then &quot;&quot;Quickly&quot;, you find an angle from which everything appears to fit perfectly and take a snapshot, at a fast shutter speed before something else bulges out too noticeably.&quot; After a trip to the darkroom for touching up, &quot;[a]ll that remains is to publish the photograph as a representation of exactly how things are, and to note how nothing fits properly into any other shape.&quot; So how does Nozick&#x27;s work differ from this form of activity? He believed that what he said was correct, but he does not mask the bulges: &quot;the doubts and worries and uncertainties as well as the beliefs, convictions, and arguments.&quot;

===Why state-of-nature theory?===
In this chapter, Nozick tries to explain why investigating a Lockean state of nature is useful in order to understand whether there should be a state in the first place. If one can show that an anarchic society is worse than one that has a state we should choose the second as the less bad alternative. To convincingly compare the two, he argues, one should focus not on an extremely pessimistic nor on an extremely optimistic view of that society. Instead, one should:

Nozick&#x27;s plan is to first describe the morally permissible and impermissible actions in such a non-political society and how violations of those constraints by some individuals would lead to the emergence of a state. If that would happen, it would explain the appearance even if no state actually developed in that particular way.

He gestures towards perhaps the biggest bulge when he notes (in Chapter 1, &quot;Why State-of-Nature Theory?&quot;) the shallowness of his &quot;invisible hand&quot; explanation of the minimal state, deriving it from a Lockean state of nature, in which there are individual rights but no state to enforce and adjudicate them. Although this counts for him as a &quot;fundamental explanation&quot; of the political realm because the political is explained in terms of the nonpolitical, it is shallow relative to his later &quot;genealogical&quot; ambition (in &quot;The Nature of Rationality&quot; and especially in &quot;Invariances&quot;) to explain both the political and the moral by reference to beneficial cooperative practices that can be traced back to our hunter-gatherer ancestors and beyond. The genealogy will give Nozick an explanation of what is only assumed in &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;: the fundamental status of individual rights. Creativity was not a factor in his interpretation. 

The state of nature described here is similar to Locke&#x27;s state of nature, but there is no separate concept of natural law.

===The state of nature===
Nozick starts this chapter by summarizing some of the features of the Lockean state of nature. An important one is that every individual has a right to exact compensation by himself whenever another individual violates his rights. Punishing the offender is also acceptable, but only inasmuch as he (or others) will be prevented from doing that again. As Locke himself acknowledges, this raises several problems, and Nozick is going to try to see to what extent can they be solved by voluntary arrangements. A rational response to the &quot;troubles&quot; of a Lockean state of nature is the establishment of mutual-protection associations, in which all will answer the call of any member. It is inconvenient that everyone is always on call, and that the associates can be called out by members who may be &quot;cantankerous or paranoid&quot;. Another important inconvenience takes place when two members of the same association have a dispute. Although there are simple rules that could solve this problem (for instance, a policy of non-intervention), most people will prefer associations that try to build systems to decide whose claims are correct.

In any case, the problem of everybody being on call dictates that some entrepreneurs will go into the business of selling protective services (division of labor). This will lead (&quot;through market pressures, economies of scale, and rational self-interest&quot;) to either people joining the strongest association in a given area or that some associations will have similar power and hence will avoid the costs of fighting by agreeing to a third party that would act as a judge or court to solve the disputes. But for all practical purposes, this second case is equivalent to having just one protective association. And this is something &quot;very much resembling a minimal state&quot;. Nozick judges that Locke was wrong to imagine a social contract as necessary to establish civil society and money. He prefers invisible-hand explanations, that is to say, that voluntary agreements between individuals create far-reaching patterns that &quot;look like they were designed&quot; when in fact nobody did. These explanations are useful in the sense that they &quot;minimize the use of notions constituting the phenomena to be explained&quot;.
So far he has shown that such an &quot;invisible hand&quot; would lead to a dominant association, but individuals may still justly enforce their own rights. But this protective agency is not yet a state. At the end of the chapter Nozick points out some of the problems of defining what a state is, but he says:

The protective agencies so far do not make any such announcement. Furthermore, it does not offer the same degree of protection to all its clients (who may purchase different degrees of coverage) and the individuals who do not purchase the service (the &quot;independents&quot;) do not get any protection at all, (spillover effects aside). This goes against our experience with states, where even tourists typically receive protection.Therefore, the dominant protective agency lacks a monopoly on the use of force and fails to protect all people inside its territory.

===Moral constraints and the state===
Nozick arrives at the night-watchman state of classical liberalism theory by showing that there are non-redistributive reasons for the apparently redistributive procedure of making its clients pay for the protection of others. He defines what he calls an ultraminimal state, which would not have this seemingly redistributive feature but would be the only one allowed to enforce rights. Proponents of this ultraminimal state do not defend it on the grounds of trying to minimize the total of (weighted) violations of rights (what he calls utilitarianism of rights.) That idea would mean, for example, that someone could punish another person they know to be innocent in order to calm down a mob that would otherwise violate even more rights. This is not the philosophy behind the ultraminimal state. Instead, its proponents hold its members&#x27; rights are a side-constraint on what can be done to them. This side-constraint view reflects the underlying Kantian principle that individuals are ends and not merely means, so the rights of &quot;one&quot; individual cannot be violated to avoid violations of the rights of &quot;other&quot; people. Which principle should we choose, then? Nozick will not try to prove which one is better. Instead, he gives some reasons to prefer the Kantian view and later points to problems with classic utilitarianism.

The first reason he gives in favor of the Kantian principle is that the analogy between the individual case (in which we choose to sacrifice now for a greater benefit later) and the social case (in which we sacrifice the interests of one individual for the greater social good) is incorrect:

A second reason focuses on the non-aggression principle. Are we prepared to dismiss this principle? That is, can we accept that some individuals may harm some innocent in certain cases? (This non-aggression principle does not include, of course, self-defense and perhaps some other special cases he points out.)

He then goes on to expose some problems with utilitarianism by discussing whether animals should be taken into account in the utilitarian calculation of happiness, if that depends on the kind of animal, if killing them painlessly would be acceptable, and so on. He believes that utilitarianism is not appropriate even with animals.

But Nozick&#x27;s most famous argument for the side-constraint view against classical utilitarianism and the idea that only felt experience matters is his Experience Machine thought experiment. It induces whatever illusory experience one might wish, but it prevents the subject from doing anything or making contact with anything. There is only pre-programmed neural stimulation sufficient for the illusion. Nozick pumps the intuition that each of us has a reason to avoid plugging into the Experience Machine forever. This is not to say that &quot;plugging in&quot; might not be the best all-things-considered choice for some who are terminally ill and in great pain. The point of the thought experiment is to articulate a weighty reason not to plug in, a reason that should not be there if all that matters is felt experience.

===Prohibition, compensation, and risk===
The procedure that leads to a night-watchman state involves compensation to non-members who are prevented from enforcing their rights, an enforcement mechanism that it deems risky by comparison with its own. Compensation addresses any disadvantages non-members suffer as a result of being unable to enforce their rights. Assuming that non-members take reasonable precautions and adjusting activities to the association&#x27;s prohibition of their enforcing their own rights, the association is required to raise the non-member above his actual position by an amount equal to the difference between his position on an indifference curve he would occupy were it not for the prohibition, and his original position.

The purpose of this comparatively dense chapter is to deduce what Nozick calls the Compensation Principle. That idea is going to be key for the next chapter, where he shows how (without any violation of rights) an ultraminimal state (one that has a monopoly of enforcement of rights) can become a &quot;minimal&quot; state (which also provides protection to all individuals). Since this would involve some people paying for the protection of others, or some people being forced to pay for protection, the main element of the discussion is whether these kinds of actions can be justified from a natural rights perspective. Hence the development of a theory of compensation in this chapter.

He starts by asking broadly what if someone &quot;crosses a boundary&quot; (for instance, physical harm.) If this is done with the consent of the individual concerned, no problem arises. Unlike Locke, Nozick does not have a &quot;paternalistic&quot; view of the matter. He believes anyone can do &quot;anything&quot; to himself, or allow others to do the same things to him.

But what if B crosses A&#x27;s boundaries without consent? Is that okay if A is compensated?

What Nozick understands by compensation is anything that makes A indifferent (that is, A has to be just as good in his own judgement &quot;before&quot; the transgression and &quot;after&quot; the compensation) provided that A has taken reasonable precautions to avoid the situation. He argues that compensation is not enough, because &quot;some&quot; people will violate these boundaries, for example, without revealing their identity. Therefore, some extra cost has to be imposed on those who violate someone else&#x27;s rights. (For the sake of simplicity this discussion on deterrence is summarized in another section of this article).

After discussing the issue of punishment and concluding that not all violations of rights will be deterred under a retributive theory of justice, (which he favors). Nozick returns to compensation. Again, why don&#x27;t we allow anyone to do anything provided they give full compensation afterwards? There are several problems with that view.

Firstly, if some person gets a big gain by violating another&#x27;s rights and they then compensate the victim up to the point of indifference, the infractor is getting all the benefits that this provides. But one could argue that it would be fair for the felon to give some compensation beyond that, just like in the marketplace, where the buyer does not necessarily just pay up to the point where the seller is indifferent from selling or not selling. There is usually room for negotiation, which raises the question of fairness. Every attempt to make a theory of a fair price in the marketplace has failed, and Nozick prefers not to try to solve the issue. Instead, he says that, whenever possible, those negotiations should take place, so that the compensation is decided by the people involved. But when one cannot negotiate, it is unclear whether &quot;all&quot; acts should be accepted if compensation is paid.

Secondly, allowing anything if compensation is paid makes &quot;all&quot; people fearful. Nozick argues that even if one knows they will be compensated if their rights are violated, they will still fear this violation. This raises important problems:
* Would financial compensation by the perpetrators include not only the damages but also compensate for the fear of the victims prior to the event, as the assaulter is not the only party responsible for that fear?
* If that is not the way to compensate, non-assaulted people would be left uncompensated for the fear they have. 
* One cannot compensate anyone for fear after the fact because we remember the fear we had as less important than it actually was. Because of that, what should be calculated instead is what Nozick calls &quot;Market Compensation&quot;, which is the compensation that would be agreed upon if the negotiations took place before the fact. But this is impossible, according to Nozick.

The conclusion of these difficulties, particularly the last one, is that anything that produces &quot;general&quot; fear may be prohibited. Another reason to prohibit is that it would imply using people as a means, which violates the Kantian principle that he defended earlier.

But if so, what about prohibiting all boundary crossing &quot;that isn&#x27;t consented in advance&quot;? That would solve the fear problem, but it would be way too restrictive, since people may cross some boundaries by accident, unintentional acts, etc.) and the costs of getting that consent may be too high (for instance if the known victim is on a trip in the jungle). What then? &quot;The most efficient policy forgoes the fewest net beneficial acts; it allows anyone to perform an unfeared action without prior agreement, provided the transaction costs of reaching a prior agreement are greater, even by a bit, than the costs of the posterior compensation process.&quot;

Note that a particular action may not cause fear if it has a low probability of causing harm. But when all the risky activities are added up, the probability of being harmed may be high. This poses the problem that prohibiting all such activities (which may be very varied) is too restrictive. The obvious response, that is, establishing a threshold value V such that there is a violation of rights if formula_1 (where p is the probability of harming and H is the amount of harm that could be done) will not fit a natural-rights position. In his own words:

Granted, some insurance solutions will work in these cases and he discusses some. But what should be done to people who do not have the means to buy insurance or compensate other people for the risks of his actions? Should they be forbidden from doing it?

(This is going to have important consequences in the next chapter, see next section).

Nozick&#x27;s conclusion is to prohibit specially dangerous actions that are generally done &quot;and&quot; compensating the specially disadvantaged individual from the prohibition. This is what he calls the Principle of Compensation. For example, it is allowed to forbid epileptics from driving, but only if they are compensated exactly for the costs that the disadvantaged has to assume (chauffeurs, taxis). This would only take place if the benefit from the increased security outweighs these costs. But this is not a negotiation. The analogy he gives is blackmail: it is not right to pay a person or group to prevent him from doing something that otherwise would give him no benefit whatsoever. Nozick considers such transactions as &quot;unproductive activities&quot;. Similarly, (it should be deduced) it is not right for the epileptic to negotiate a payment for not doing something risky to other people.

However, Nozick does point to some problems with this principle. Firstly, he says that the action has to be &quot;generally done&quot;. The intention behind that qualification is that eccentric and dangerous activities should not be compensated. His extreme example is someone who has fun playing Russian roulette with the head of others without asking them. Such action must be prohibited, with no qualifications. But one can define anything as a &quot;generally done&quot; action. The Russian roulette could be considered &quot;having fun&quot; and hence be compensated. Secondly, if the special and dangerous action is the only way a person can do something important to him (for instance, if it is the &quot;only&quot; way one can have fun or support himself) then perhaps it should be compensated. Thirdly, more generally, he recognizes he does not have a theory of disadvantage, so it is unclear what counts as a &quot;special disadvantage&quot;.

This has to be further developed, because in the state of nature there is no authority to decide how to define these terms (see the discussion of a similar issue in p. 89).

===The state===
An independent might be prohibited from using his methods of privately enforcing justice if:
* His method is too risky (“perhaps he consults tea leaves”)
* He uses a method of unknown riskiness.
Nevertheless, an independent may be using a method that does not impose a high risk on others but, if similar procedures are used by many others the total risk may go beyond an acceptable threshold. In that case it is impossible to decide who should stop doing it, since nobody is personally responsible and therefore nobody has a right to stop him. Independents may get together to decide these questions, but even if they agree to a mechanism to keep the total risk below the threshold, each individual will have an incentive to get out of the deal. This procedure fails because of the rationality of being a free rider on such grouping, taking advantage of everyone else&#x27;s restraint and going ahead with one&#x27;s own risky activities. In a famous discussion he rejects H. L. A. Hart&#x27;s &quot;principle of fairness&quot; for dealing with free riders, which would morally bind them to cooperative practices from which they benefit. One may not charge and collect for benefits one bestows without prior agreement. But Nozick refutes this.

If the principle of fairness does not work, how should we decide this? Natural law tradition does not help much in clarifying what procedural rights we have. Nozick assumes that we all have a right to know that we are being applied a fair and reliable method for deciding if we are guilty. If this information is not available publicly, we have a right to resist. We may also do it if we find this procedure unreliable or unfair after considering the information given. We may not even participate in the process, even if it would be advisable to do so.

The application of these rights may be delegated to the protective agency, which will prevent others from applying methods of which it finds unacceptable in terms of reliability or fairness. Presumably, it would publish a list of accepted methods. Anyone who violates this prohibition will be punished. Every individual has a right to do this, and other companies could try to enter the business, but the dominant protective agency is the only one that has the power to actually carry out this prohibition. It is the only one that can guarantee its clients that no unaccepted procedure will be applied to them.

But there is another important difference: the protective agency, in doing this, can put some independents in a situation of disadvantage. Specifically, those independents who use a prohibited method and cannot afford its services without great effort (or are even too poor to pay no matter what). These people will be at the expense of paying clients of the agency.

In the previous chapter we saw that it was necessary to compensate others for the disadvantages imposed on them. We also saw that this compensation would amount only to the extra cost imposed to the disadvantaged beyond the costs that he would otherwise incur (in this case, the costs of the risky/unknown procedure he would want to apply). Nevertheless, it would amount to even the full price of a simple protection policy if the independent is unable to pay for it after the compensation for the disadvantages.

Also, the protective services that count here are strictly against &quot;paying clients&quot;, because these are the ones against whom the independent was defenceless in the first place.

But wouldn’t this compensation mechanism generate another free riding problem? Nozick says that not much, because the compensation is only “the amount that would equal the cost of an unfancy policy when added to the sum of the monetary costs of self-help protection plus whatever amount the person comfortably could pay”. Also, as we just said, it is an unfancy policy that protects only against paying clients, not against compensated clients and other independents. Therefore, the more free riders there are, the more important it becomes to buy a full protection policy.

We can see that what we now have resembles a state. In chapter 3 Nozick argued that two necessary conditions to be fulfilled by an organization to be a state were:
# Monopoly of the use of force.
# Universal protection.
The protective agency resembles a state in these two conditions. Firstly, it is a &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly due to the competitive advantage mentioned earlier. It does not have any special right to be it, it just is.

Secondly, most of the people are its clients. There may be independents, however, who apply procedures it approves of. Also, there might still be independents who apply methods that it disapproves of to other independents with unreliable procedures.

These conditions are important because they are the basis for the “individualist anarchist” to claim that every state is necessarily illegitimate. This part of the book is a refutation of that claim, showing that some states could be formed by a series of legitimate steps. The &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly has arisen by morally permissible steps and the universal protection, is not really redistributive because the people who are given money or protective services at a discount had a right to this as a compensation for the disadvantages forced upon them. Therefore, the state is not violating anybody’s rights.

Note that this is not a state as we usually understand it. It is presumably organized more like a company and, more importantly, there still exist independents. But, as Nozick says:

He does recognize, however, that this entity does not fit perfectly in the Weberian tradition of the definition of the state. It is not “the sole authorizer of violence”, since some independents may conduct violence to one another without intervention. But it is the sole &quot;effective&quot; judge over the permissibility of violence. Therefore, he concludes, this may be also called a “statelike entity.”

Finally, Nozick warns us that the step from being just a &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly (the &quot;ultraminimal state&quot;) to becoming this “statelike entity” that compensates some independents (the &quot;minimal&quot; state) is not a necessary one. Compensating is a moral obligation. But this does not invalidate Nozick’s response to the individualist anarchist and it remains an invisible hand explanation: after all, to give universal protection the agency does not need to have any plan to become a state. It just happens if it decides to give the protection it owes.

===Further considerations on the argument for the state===
A discussion of pre-emptive attack leads Nozick to a principle that excludes prohibiting actions not wrong in themselves, even if those actions make more likely the commission of wrongs later on. This provides him with a significant difference between a protection agency&#x27;s prohibitions against procedures it deems unreliable or unfair, and other prohibitions that might seem to go too far, such as forbidding others to join another protective agency. Nozick&#x27;s principle does not disallow others from doing so.

===Distributive justice===
Nozick&#x27;s discussion of Rawls&#x27;s theory of justice raised a prominent dialogue between libertarianism and liberalism. He sketches an entitlement theory, which states, &quot;From each as they choose, to each as they are chosen&quot;. It comprises a theory of (1) justice in acquisition; (2) justice in rectification if (1) is violated (rectification which might require apparently redistributive measures); (3) justice in holdings, and (4) justice in transfer. Assuming justice in acquisition, entitlement to holdings is a function of repeated applications of (3) and (4). Nozick&#x27;s entitlement theory is a non-patterned historical principle. Almost all other principles of distributive justice (egalitarianism, utilitarianism) are patterned principles of justice. Such principles follow the form, &quot;to each according to...&quot;

Nozick&#x27;s famous Wilt Chamberlain argument is an attempt to show that patterned principles of just distribution are incompatible with liberty. He asks us to assume that the original distribution in society, D1, is ordered by our choice of patterned principle, for instance Rawls&#x27;s Difference Principle. Wilt Chamberlain is an extremely popular basketball player in this society, and Nozick further assumes 1 million people are willing to freely give Chamberlain 25 cents each to watch him play basketball over the course of a season (we assume no other transactions occur). Chamberlain now has $250,000, a much larger sum than any of the other people in the society. This new distribution in society, call it D2, obviously is no longer ordered by our favored pattern that ordered D1. However Nozick argues that D2 is just. For if each agent freely exchanges some of his D1 share with the basketball player and D1 was a just distribution (we know D1 was just, because it was ordered according to the favored patterned principle of distribution), how can D2 fail to be a just distribution? Thus Nozick argues that what the Wilt Chamberlain example shows is that no patterned principle of just distribution will be compatible with liberty. In order to preserve the pattern, which arranged D1, the state will have to continually interfere with people&#x27;s ability to freely exchange their D1 shares, for any exchange of D1 shares explicitly involves violating the pattern that originally ordered it.

Nozick analogizes taxation with forced labor, asking the reader to imagine a man who works longer to gain income to buy a movie ticket and a man who spends his extra time on leisure (for instance, watching the sunset). What, Nozick asks, is the difference between seizing the second man&#x27;s leisure (which would be forced labor) and seizing the first man&#x27;s goods? &quot;Perhaps there is no difference in principle,&quot; Nozick concludes, and notes that the argument could be extended to taxation on other sources besides labor. &quot;End-state and most patterned principles of distributive justice institute (partial) ownership by others of people and their actions and labor. These principles involve a shift from the classical liberals&#x27; notion of self ownership to a notion of (partial) property rights in &quot;other&quot; people.&quot;

Nozick then briefly considers Locke&#x27;s theory of acquisition. After considering some preliminary objections, he &quot;adds an additional bit of complexity&quot; to the structure of the entitlement theory by refining Locke&#x27;s proviso that &quot;enough and as good&quot; must be left in common for others by one&#x27;s taking property in an unowned object. Nozick favors a &quot;Lockean proviso&quot; that forbids appropriation when the position of others is thereby worsened. For instance, appropriating the only water hole in a desert and charging monopoly prices would not be legitimate. But in line with his endorsement of the historical principle, this argument does not apply to the medical researcher who discovers a cure for a disease and sells for whatever price he will. Nor does Nozick provide any means or theory whereby abuses of appropriation—acquisition of property when there is &quot;not&quot; enough and as good in common for others—should be corrected. 

===The Difference Principle===
Nozick attacks John Rawls&#x27;s Difference Principle on the ground that the well-off could threaten a lack of social cooperation to the worse-off, just as Rawls implies that the worse-off will be assisted by the well-off for the sake of social cooperation. Nozick asks why the well-off would be obliged, due to their inequality and for the sake of social cooperation, to assist the worse-off and not have the worse-off accept the inequality and benefit the well-off. Furthermore, Rawls&#x27;s idea regarding morally arbitrary natural endowments comes under fire; Nozick argues that natural advantages that the well-off enjoy do not violate anyone&#x27;s rights and that, therefore, the well-off have a right to them. He also states that Rawls&#x27;s proposal that inequalities be geared toward assisting the worse-off is morally arbitrary in itself.

===Original position===
Nozick&#x27;s opinions on &quot;historical entitlement&quot; ensures that he naturally rejects the &quot;Original Position&quot; since he argues that in the &quot;Original Position&quot; individuals will use an &quot;end-state&quot; principle to determine the outcome, whilst he explicitly states the importance of the historicity of any such decisions (for example punishments and penalties will require historical information).

===Equality, Envy, Exploitation, Etc.===
Nozick presses &quot;the major objection&quot; to theories that bestow and enforce positive rights to various things such as equality of opportunity, life, and so on. &quot;These &#x27;rights&#x27; require a substructure of things and materials and actions,&quot; he writes, &quot;and &#x27;other&#x27; people may have rights and entitlements over these.&quot;

Nozick concludes that &quot;Marxian exploitation is the exploitation of people&#x27;s lack of understanding of economics.&quot;

===Demoktesis===
Demoktesis is a thought-experiment designed to show the incompatibility of democracy with libertarianism in general and the entitlement theory specifically. People desirous of more money might &quot;hit upon the idea of incorporating themselves, raising money by selling shares in themselves.&quot; They would partition such rights as which occupation one would have. Though perhaps no one sells himself into utter slavery, there arises through voluntary exchanges a &quot;very extensive domination&quot; of some person by others. This intolerable situation is avoided by writing new terms of incorporation that for any stock no one already owning more than a certain number of shares may purchase it. As the process goes on, everyone sells off rights in themselves, &quot;keeping one share in each right as their own, so they can attend stockholders&#x27; meetings if they wish.&quot; The inconvenience of attending such meetings leads to a special occupation of stockholders&#x27; representative. There is a great dispersal of shares such that almost everybody is deciding about everybody else. The system is still unwieldy, so a &quot;great consolidational convention&quot; is convened for buying and selling shares, and after a &quot;hectic three days (lo and behold!)&quot; each person owns exactly one share in each right over every other person, including himself. So now there can be just one meeting in which everything is decided for everybody. Attendance is too great and it&#x27;s boring, so it is decided that only those entitled to cast at least 100,000 votes may attend the grand stockholders&#x27; meeting. And so on. Their social theorists call the system &quot;demoktesis&quot; (from Greek δῆμος &quot;demos&quot;, &quot;people&quot; and κτῆσις &quot;ktesis&quot;, &quot;ownership&quot;), &quot;ownership of the people, by the people, and for the people&quot;, and declare it the highest form of social life, one that must not be allowed to perish from the earth. With this &quot;eldritch tale&quot; we have in fact arrived at a modern democratic state.

===A Framework for Utopia===
The utopia mentioned in the title of Nozick&#x27;s first book is a meta-utopia, a framework for voluntary migration between utopias tending towards worlds in which everybody benefits from everybody else&#x27;s presence. This is meant to be the Lockean &quot;night-watchman state&quot; writ large. The state protects individual rights and makes sure that contracts and other market transactions are voluntary. The meta-utopian framework reveals what is inspiring and noble in this night-watchman function. They both contain the only form of social union that is possible for the atomistic rational agents of &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;, fully voluntary associations of mutual benefit. The influence of this idea on Nozick&#x27;s thinking is profound. Even in his last book, &quot;Invariances&quot;, he is still concerned to give priority to the mutual-benefit aspect of ethics. This coercively enforceable aspect ideally has an &quot;empty core&quot; in the game theorists&#x27; sense: the core of a game is all of those payoff vectors to the group wherein no subgroup can do better for itself acting on its own, without cooperating with others not in the subgroup. The worlds in Nozick&#x27;s meta-utopia have empty cores. No subgroup of a utopian world is better off to emigrate to its own smaller world. The function of ethics is fundamentally to create and stabilize such empty cores of mutually beneficial cooperation. His view is that we are fortunate to live under conditions that favor &quot;more-extensive cores&quot;, and less conquest, slavery, and pillaging, &quot;less imposition of noncore vectors upon subgroups.&quot; Higher moral goals are real enough, but they are parasitic (as described in &quot;The Examined Life&quot;, the chapter &quot;Darkness and Light&quot;) upon mutually beneficial cooperation.

In Nozick&#x27;s utopia if people are not happy with the society they are in they can leave and start their own community, but he fails to consider that there might be things that prevent a person from leaving or moving about freely. Thomas Pogge states that items that are not socially induced can restrict people&#x27;s options. Nozick states that for the healthy to have to support the handicapped imposes on their freedom, but Pogge argues that it introduces an inequality. This inequality restricts movement based on the ground rules Nozick has implemented, which could lead to feudalism and slavery, a society which Nozick himself would reject. David Schaefer notes that Nozick himself claims that a person could sell himself into slavery, which would break the very ground rule that was created, restricting the movement and choices that a person could make.

==Other topics covered in the book==
===Retributive and deterrence theories of punishment===
In chapter 4 Nozick discusses two theories of punishment: the deterrence and the retributive ones. To compare them, we have to take into account what is the decision that a potential infractor is facing. His decision may be determined by:

formula_2

Where G are the gains from violating the victim&#x27;s rights, p is the probability of getting caught and (C + D + E) are the costs that the infractor would face if caught. Specifically, C is full compensation to the victim, D are all the emotional costs that the infractor would face if caught (by being apprehended, placed on trial and so on) and E are the financial costs of the processes of apprehension and trial.

So if this equation is positive, the potential infractor will have an incentive to violate the potential victim&#x27;s rights.

Here the two theories come into play. On a retributive justice framework, an additional cost R should be imposed to the transgressor that is proportional to the harm done (or intended to be done).

Specifically, formula_3, where r is the degree of responsibility the infractor has and formula_4.

Therefore, the decision a potential infractor would now face would be:

formula_5

But this still will not deter all people. The equation would be positive if G is high enough or, more importantly, if p is low. That is, if it is very unlikely that an infractor will be caught, they may very well choose to do it even if they have to face the new cost R. Therefore, retributive justice theories allow some failures of deterrence.

On the other hand, deterrence theories (&quot;the penalty for a crime should be the minimal one necessary to deter commission of it&quot;) do not give enough guidance on how much deterrence should we aim at. If every single possible violation of rights is to be deterred, &quot;the penalty will be set unacceptably high&quot;. The problem here is that the infractor may be punished well beyond the harm done to deter &quot;other people&quot;.

According to Nozick, the utilitarian response to the latest problem would be to raise the penalty until the point where more additional unhappiness would be created than would be saved to those who will not be victimized as a consequence of the additional penalty. But this will not do, according to Nozick, because it raises another problem: should the happiness of the victim have more weight in the calculation than the happiness of the felon? If so, how much?

He concludes that the retributive framework is better on grounds of simplicity.

Similarly, under the retributive theory, he contends that self-defense is appropriate even if the victim uses more force to defend themself. In particular, he proposes that the maximum amount of force that a potential victim can use is:

formula_6

And in this case H is the harm that the victim thinks that the other is going to inflict upon themself. However, if he uses more force than f(H), that additional force has to be subtracted later from the punishment that the felon gets.

===Animal rights and utilitarianism===
Nozick discusses in chapter 3 whether animals have rights too or whether they can be used, and if the species of the animal says anything about the extent to which this can be done. He also analyzes the proposal &quot;utilitarianism for animals, Kantianism for people,&quot; ultimately rejecting it, saying: &quot;Even for animals, utilitarianism won&#x27;t do as the whole story, but the thicket of questions daunts us.&quot; Here Nozick also espouses ethical vegetarianism, saying: &quot;Though I should say in my view the extra benefits Americans today can gain from eating animals do &quot;not&quot; justify doing it. So we shouldn&#x27;t.&quot; Philosopher Josh Milburn has argued that Nozick&#x27;s contributions have been overlooked in the literature on both animal ethics and libertarianism.

==Reception==

&quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; came out of a semester-long course that Nozick taught with Michael Walzer at Harvard in 1971, called &quot;Capitalism and Socialism&quot;. The course was a debate between the two; Nozick&#x27;s side is in &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia,&quot; and Walzer&#x27;s side is in his &quot;Spheres of Justice&quot; (1983), in which he argues for &quot;complex equality&quot;.

Murray Rothbard, an anarcho-capitalist, criticizes &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; in his essay &quot;Robert Nozick and the Immaculate Conception of the State&quot; on the basis that:

# No existing state has actually developed by the &#x27;invisible hand&#x27; process described by Nozick, and therefore Nozick, on his own grounds, should &quot;advocate anarchism&quot; and then &quot;wait for his State to develop&quot;.
# Even if any State had been so conceived, individual rights are inalienable and therefore no existing State could be justified.
# A correct theory of contracts is the title-transfer theory which states that the only valid and enforceable contract is one that surrenders what is, in fact, philosophically alienable, and that only specific titles to property are so alienable. Therefore no one can surrender his own will, his body, other persons, or the rights of his posterity.
# The risk and compensation principles are both fallacious and result in unlimited despotism.
# Compensation, in the theory of punishment, is simply a method of trying to recompense the victim after a crime occurs; it can never justify the initial violation of individual rights.
# Nozick’s theory of “nonproductive” exchanges is invalid since in economic theory all voluntary exchanges are by definition productive, so that the prohibition of &quot;nonproductive&quot; risky activities and hence the ultra-minimal state falls on this account alone.
# Contrary to Nozick, there are no “procedural rights,” and therefore no way to get from his theory of risk and nonproductive exchange to the compulsory monopoly of the ultra-minimal state.
# Nozick’s minimal state would, on his own grounds, justify a maximal State as well.
# The only “invisible hand” process, on Nozick’s own terms, would move society from his minimal State &quot;back to anarchism&quot;.

The American legal scholar Arthur Allen Leff criticized Nozick in his 1979 article &quot;Unspeakable Ethics, Unnatural Law&quot;. Leff stated that Nozick built his entire book on the bald assertion that &quot;individuals have rights which may not be violated by other individuals&quot;, for which no justification is offered. According to Leff, no such justification is possible either. Any desired ethical statement, including a negation of Nozick&#x27;s position, can easily be &quot;proved&quot; with apparent rigor as long as one takes the licence to simply establish a grounding principle by assertion. Leff further calls &quot;ostentatiously unconvincing&quot; Nozick&#x27;s proposal that differences among individuals will not be a problem if like-minded people form geographically isolated communities.

Philosopher Jan Narveson described Nozick&#x27;s book as &quot;brilliant&quot;.

Cato Institute fellow Tom G. Palmer writes that &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; is &quot;witty and dazzling&quot;, and offers a strong criticism of John Rawls&#x27;s &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. Palmer adds that, &quot;Largely because of his remarks on Rawls and the extraordinary power of his intellect, Nozick&#x27;s book was taken quite seriously by academic philosophers and political theorists, many of whom had not read contemporary libertarian (or classical liberal) material and considered this to be the only articulation of libertarianism available. Since Nozick was writing to defend the limited state and did not justify his starting assumption that individuals have rights, this led some academics to dismiss libertarianism as &#x27;without foundations,&#x27; in the words of the philosopher Thomas Nagel. When read in light of the explicit statement of the book&#x27;s purpose, however, this criticism is misdirected&quot;.

Libertarian author David Boaz writes that &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;, together with Rothbard&#x27;s &quot;For a New Liberty&quot; (1973) and Ayn Rand&#x27;s essays on political philosophy, &quot;defined the &#x27;hard-core&#x27; version of modern libertarianism, which essentially restated Spencer&#x27;s law of equal freedom: Individuals have the right to do whatever they want to do, so long as they respect the equal rights of others.&quot;

In the article &quot;Social Unity and Primary Goods&quot;, republished in his &quot;Collected Papers&quot; (1999), Rawls notes that Nozick handles Sen&#x27;s liberal paradox in a manner that is similar to his own. However, the rights that Nozick takes to be fundamental and the basis for regarding them to be such are different from the equal basic liberties included in justice as fairness and Rawls conjectures that they are thus not inalienable.

In &quot;Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy&quot; (2007), Rawls notes that Nozick assumes that just transactions are &quot;justice preserving&quot; in much the same way that logical operations are &quot;truth preserving&quot;. Thus, as explained in Distributive justice above, Nozick holds that repetitive applications of &quot;justice in holdings&quot; and &quot;justice in transfer&quot; preserve an initial state of justice obtained through &quot;justice in acquisition or rectification&quot;. Rawls points out that this is simply an assumption or presupposition and requires substantiation. In reality, he maintains, small inequalities established by just transactions accumulate over time and eventually result in large inequalities and an unjust situation.

Some have seen his description of the private towns, set apart from his theory of the state, as if he were condoning feudal subjugation:

<text>Mario Mauro (born 24 July 1961) is an Italian politician and a university teacher of history. He is the former Minister of Defence, having served in the Letta Cabinet from 2013 to 2014. From 1999 to 2013, he was a member of the European Parliament, and he is a member of Communion and Liberation.

==Early life and education==
Mauro was born in San Giovanni Rotondo on 24 July 1961. He studied literature and philosophy at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (UCSC) in Milan and received a degree in 1985.

==Career==
Mauro began his career as a teacher in southern Italy after graduation and until 1999, he continued to serve as a teacher and established the Public Social Services University Research Centre. He was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999 with the PPE-DE group. From 1999 to 2004, he was vice president of the education and culture commission. On 2 July 2004, he was elected one of the 14 vice presidents of the parliament. His tenure as vice president lasted until 2009. In June 2009, he was elected again to the parliament. He assumed the post of the leader of the Italian center-right MEPs for the period of 2009–2013.

In addition to his position as European Parliamentary, he held the following positions: representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) against racism, xenophobia, and discrimination, concerning discrimination against Christians from 2009 to 2011, and adjunct professor at the European University of Rome from 2007 to 2009.

In 2013, Mauro resigned from Il Popolo della Libertà and joined Civic Choice (SC). He was elected senator on With Monti for Italy&#x27;s lists, a coalition between Civic Choice, Union of the Centre and Future and Freedom. He was elected the leader of the SC parliamentary group in the Senate. He was replaced in the European Parliament by Susy De Martini.

On 28 April 2013, Mauro was sworn in as defense minister in the grand coalition cabinet of Enrico Letta. After internal rifts inside the Civic Choice party, Mauro left it in November 2013 and launched the new Populars for Italy.

==Personal life==
Mauro is married to Giovanna; they have two children, Francesca Romana and Angelo.

<text>Mary Beatrice Midgley (&#x27;Scrutton&quot;&#x27;; 13 September 1919 – 10 October 2018) was a British philosopher. A senior lecturer in philosophy at Newcastle University, she was known for her work on science, ethics and animal rights. She wrote her first book, &quot;Beast and Man&quot; (1978), when she was in her late fifties, and went on to write over 15 more, including &quot;Animals and Why They Matter&quot; (1983), &quot;Wickedness&quot; (1984), &quot;The Ethical Primate&quot; (1994), &quot;Evolution as a Religion&quot; (1985), and &quot;Science as Salvation&quot; (1992). She was awarded honorary doctorates by Durham and Newcastle universities. Her autobiography, &quot;The Owl of Minerva&quot;, was published in 2005.

Midgley strongly opposed reductionism and scientism, and argued against any attempt to make science a substitute for the humanities. She wrote extensively about what she thought philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. Midgley insisted that humans ought to be understood as first and foremost, a kind of animal. Several of her books and articles discussed philosophical ideas appearing in popular science, including those of Richard Dawkins. She also wrote in favour of a moral interpretation of the Gaia hypothesis. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK&#x27;s &quot;foremost scourge of &#x27;scientific pretension&#x27;&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Midgley was born in London to Lesley and Tom Scrutton. Her father, the son of the eminent judge Sir Thomas Edward Scrutton, was a curate in Dulwich and later chaplain of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. She was raised in Cambridge, Greenford and Ealing, and educated at Downe House School in Cold Ash, Berkshire, where she developed her interest in classics and philosophy:
[A] new and vigorous Classics teacher offered to teach a few of us Greek, and that too was somehow slotted into our timetables. We loved this and worked madly at it, which meant that with considerable efforts on all sides, it was just possible for us to go to college on Classics … I had decided to read Classics rather than English – which was the first choice that occurred to me – because my English teacher, bless her, pointed out that English literature is something that you read in any case, so it is better to study something that you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t. Someone also told me that, if you did Classics at Oxford, you could do Philosophy as well. I knew very little about this but, as I had just found Plato, I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it.
Midgley took the Oxford entrance exam in the autumn of 1937, gaining a place at Somerville College. During the year before starting university, it was arranged that she would live in Austria for three months to learn German, but she had to leave after a month because of the worsening political situation. At Somerville she studied Mods and Greats alongside Iris Murdoch, graduating with a first-class honours degree.

Several of her lasting friendships that began at Oxford were with scientists, and she credited them with having educated her in a number of scientific disciplines. After a split in the Labour club at Oxford over the Soviet Union&#x27;s actions, she was on the committee of the newly formed Democratic Socialist Club alongside Tony Crosland and Roy Jenkins.

During Midgley&#x27;s time at Oxford, many of the young male undergraduates left to fight in the Second World War. This left the women undergraduates in an unlikely positions: for the first time they made up the majority in the student body. Recalling this time, Midgley writes &quot;I think myself that this experience has something to do with the fact that Elizabeth [Anscombe] and I and Iris [Murdoch] and Philippa Foot and Mary Warnock have all made our names in philosophy... I do think that in normal times a lot of good female thinking is wasted because it simply doesn&#x27;t get heard.&quot; Interest in the philosophy of the women philosophers at this time sparked the interest of two philosophers at Durham University, who began a project called &quot;In Parenthesis]&quot; which explores the connections between four women philosophers (Foot, Anscombe, Midgley and Murdoch).

==Career==

Midgley left Oxford in 1942 and went into the civil service, as &quot;the war put graduate work right out of the question&quot;. Instead, she &quot;spent the rest of the war doing various kinds of work that were held to be of national importance&quot;. During this time she was also a teacher at Downe School and Bedford School. She returned to Oxford in 1947 to do graduate work with Gilbert Murray. She began research on Plotinus&#x27;s view of the soul, which she has described as &quot;so unfashionable and so vast that I never finished my thesis&quot;. In retrospect Midgley has written of her belief that she is &quot;lucky&quot; to have missed out on having a doctorate. She argues that one of the main flaws in doctoral training is that, while it &quot;shows you how to deal with difficult arguments&quot;, it does not &quot;help you to grasp the big questions that provide its context – the background issues out of which the small problems arose.&quot;

In 1949 Midgley went to Reading University, teaching in the philosophy department there for four terms. In 1950 she married Geoffrey Midgley (died 1997), also a philosopher. They moved to Newcastle, where he got a job in the philosophy department of Newcastle University. Midgley stopped teaching for several years while she had three sons (Tom, David and Martin), before also getting a job in the philosophy department at Newcastle, where she and her husband were both &quot;much loved&quot;. Midgley taught there between 1962 and 1980. During her time at Newcastle, she began studying ethology and this led to her first book, &quot;Beast and Man&quot; (1978), published when she was 59. &quot;I wrote no books until I was a good 50, and I&#x27;m jolly glad because I didn&#x27;t know what I thought before then.&quot;

==Awards==
Midgley was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by Durham University in 1995 and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law by Newcastle University in 2008. She was an honorary fellow of the Policy, Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre at Newcastle University. In 2011 she was the first winner of the Philosophy Now Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity.

==Death==
Midgley died at the age of 99 in Jesmond on 10 October 2018.

==Ideas and arguments==

===The purpose of philosophy ===
Midgley argued that philosophy is like plumbing, something that nobody notices until it goes wrong. &quot;Then suddenly we become aware of some bad smells, and we have to take up the floorboards and look at the concepts of even the most ordinary piece of thinking. The great philosophers ... noticed how badly things were going wrong, and made suggestions about how they could be dealt with.&quot; Midgley argued that philosophy was not something that was reserved for intellectuals and academics. In her view, it is something we &quot;all&quot; do — an activity that is part of the human conditions.

=== Philosophy and religion ===
Despite her upbringing, she did not embrace Christianity herself, because, she says, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t make it work. I would try to pray and it didn&#x27;t seem to get me anywhere so I stopped after a while. But I think it&#x27;s a perfectly sensible world view.&quot; She also argues that the world&#x27;s religions should not simply be ignored: &quot;It turns out that the evils which have infested religion are not confined to it, but are ones that can accompany any successful human institution. Nor is it even clear that religion itself is something that the human race either can or should be cured of.&quot;

Midgley&#x27;s book &quot;Wickedness&quot; (1984) has been described as coming &quot;closest to addressing a theological theme: the problem of evil.&quot; But, Midgley argues that we need to understand the human capacity for wickedness, rather than blaming God for it. Midgley argues that evil arises from aspects of human nature, not from an external force. She further argues that evil is the absence of good, with good being described as the positive virtues such as generosity, courage and kindness. Therefore, evil is the absence of these characteristics, leading to selfishness, cowardice and similar. She therefore criticizes existentialism and other schools of thought which promote the &#x27;Rational Will&#x27; as a free agent. She also criticizes the tendency to demonize those deemed &#x27;wicked&#x27;, by failing to acknowledge that they also display some measure of some of the virtues.

Midgley also expressed her interest in Paul Davies&#x27; ideas on the inherent improbability of the order found in the universe. She argued that &quot;there&#x27;s some sort of tendency towards the formation of order&quot;, including towards life and &quot;perceptive life&quot;. The best way, she argued, of talking about this is using the concept of &quot;a life force&quot;, although she acknowledged that this is &quot;vague&quot;. She also argued that &quot;gratitude&quot; is an important part of the motivation for theism. &quot;You go out on a day like this and you&#x27;re really grateful. I don&#x27;t know who to.&quot;

This understanding also links with Midgley&#x27;s argument that the concept of Gaia has &quot;both a scientific and a religious aspect.&quot; She argued that people find this hard to grasp because our views on both science and religion have been narrowed so much that the connections between them are now obscured. This is not, however, about belief in a personal God, but instead about responding to the system of life, as revealed by Gaia, with &quot;wonder, awe and gratitude&quot;

She observes that &quot;practically all the great European philosophers have been bachelors&quot;, and argues that this may be responsible for the solipsism, skepticism, and individualism that dominate the tradition.

===Gaia and philosophy===
Midgley was supportive of James Lovelock&#x27;s Gaia hypothesis. This was part of her &quot;principal passion&quot; of &quot;reviving our reverence for the earth&quot;. Midgley also described Gaia as a &quot;breakthrough&quot;, as it was &quot;the first time a theory derived from scientific measurements has carried with it an implicit moral imperative – the need to act in the interests of this living system on which we all depend.

In 2001 Midgley founded, along with David Midgley and Tom Wakeford, the Gaia Network, and became its first Chair. Their regular meetings on the implications of Gaia led to the 2007 book &quot;Earthy realism&quot; edited by Midgley, which sought to bring together the scientific and spiritual aspects of Gaia theory.

Midgley&#x27;s 2001 pamphlet for Demos &quot;Gaia: The next big idea&quot; argues for the importance of the idea of Gaia as a &quot;powerful tool&quot; in science, morality, psychology and politics, to gain a more holistic understanding of the world. Instead, Midgley argued that we &quot;must learn how to value various aspects of our environment, how to structure social relationships and institutions so that we value social and spiritual life, as well as the natural world, alongside commercial and economic aspects.

Her book &quot;Science and Poetry&quot;, also published in 2001, also includes a discussion on the idea of Gaia, which she argued &quot;is not a gratuitous, semi-mystical fantasy&quot;, but instead is &quot;a useful idea, a cure for distortions that spoil our current world-view.&quot; It is useful both in finding practical solutions to environmental problems and also in giving us &quot;a more realistic view of ourselves&quot;. Gaia has, Midgley argued, both scientific and moral importance, which also involves politics. There is also a religious angle to Gaia.

===Reductionism and materialism===
&quot;Beast and Man&quot; was an examination of human nature and a reaction against the reductionism of sociobiology, and the relativism and behaviorism she saw as prevalent in much of social science. She argued that human beings are more similar to animals than many social scientists then acknowledged, while animals are in many ways more sophisticated than was often accepted. She criticized existentialists who argued that there was no such thing as human nature and writers such as Desmond Morris who she understood as arguing that human nature was &quot;brutal and nasty&quot;. Instead, she argued that human beings and their relationship with animals could be better understood by using the qualitative methods of ethology and comparative psychology, and that this approach showed that &quot;we do have a nature and it&#x27;s much more in the middle.&quot;

Writing in the 2002 introduction to the reprint of &quot;Evolution as a Religion&quot; (1985), Midgley reported that she wrote both this book, and the later &quot;Science as Salvation&quot; (1992) to counter the &quot;quasi-scientific speculation&quot; of &quot;certain remarkable prophetic and metaphysical passages that appeared suddenly in scientific books, often in their last chapters.&quot; &quot;Evolution as a Religion&quot; dealt with the theories of evolutionary biologists, including Dawkins, while &quot;Science as Salvation&quot; dealt with the theories of physicists and artificial intelligence researchers. Midgley writes that she still believes that these theories, &quot;have nothing to do with any reputable theory of evolution,&quot; and will not solve the real social and moral problems the world is facing, either through genetic engineering or the use of machines. She concludes: &quot;These schemes still seem to me to be just displacement activities proposed in order to avoid facing our real difficulties.&quot; &quot;[I]n exposing these rhetorical attempts to turn science into a comprehensive ideology,&quot; she wrote in &quot;The myths we live by&quot;, &quot;I am not attacking science but defending it against dangerous misconstructions.&quot;

Midgley argued against reductionism, or the attempt to impose any one approach to understanding the world. She suggests that there are &quot;many maps, many windows,&quot; arguing that &quot;we need &quot;scientific pluralism&quot;—the recognition that there are many independent forms and sources of knowledge—rather than reductivism, the conviction that one fundamental form underlies them all and settles everything.&quot; She writes that it is helpful to think of the world as &quot;a huge aquarium. We cannot see it as a whole from above, so we peer in at it through a number of small windows ... We can eventually make quite a lot of sense of this habitat if we patiently put together the data from different angles. But if we insist that our own window is the only one worth looking through, we shall not get very far.&quot;

She argued that, &quot;acknowledging matter as somehow akin to and penetrated by mind is not adding a new ... assumption ... it is becoming aware of something we are doing already.&quot; She suggested that &quot;this topic is essentially the one which caused Einstein often to remark that the really surprising thing about science is that it works at all ... the simple observation that the laws of thought turn out to be the laws of things.&quot;

Midgley wrote her 2014 book, &quot;Are you an illusion?&quot; as a response to Francis Crick&#x27;s argument in his book &quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis&quot; that a person&#x27;s sense of personal identity and free will is no more than the behaviour of nerve cells. She attacks the understanding inherent in this argument that everything, including a sense of self, can be understood through its physical properties. Instead, she argues that there are different levels of explanation, which need to be studied using different methods. This means that thoughts and memories are an integral part of reality for both humans and animals and need to be studied as such.

===Midgley–Dawkins debate===
In 1978, J. L. Mackie published an article entitled &quot;The Law of the Jungle: Moral Alternatives and Principles of Evolution&quot;, praising Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, and discussing how its ideas might be applied to moral philosophy. Midgley responded in 1979 with &quot;Gene-Juggling&quot;, arguing that &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; was about psychological egoism, rather than evolution. In a 1981 rebuttal, Dawkins retorted that the comment was &quot;hard to match, in reputable journals, for its patronising condescension toward a fellow academic&quot;.

The bad feeling between Dawkins and Midgley did not diminish. In a note to page 55 in the 2nd edition of &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (1989), Dawkins refers to her &quot;highly intemperate and vicious paper&quot;. Midgley continued to oppose Dawkins&#x27; ideas. In her books &quot;Evolution as a Religion&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Myths We Live By&quot; (2003), she wrote about what she saw as his confused use of language — using terms such as &quot;selfish&quot; in different ways without alerting the reader to the change in meaning—and some of what she regarded as his rhetoric (&quot;genes exert ultimate power over behaviour&quot;), which she argued is more akin to religion than science. She wrote in a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2005:

[There is] widespread discontent with the neo-Darwinist—or Dawkinsist—orthodoxy that claims something which Darwin himself denied, namely that natural selection is the sole and exclusive cause of evolution, making the world therefore, in some important sense, entirely random. This is itself a strange faith which ought not to be taken for granted as part of science.

In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; in September 2007, she argued that Dawkins&#x27; views on evolution are ideologically driven: &quot;The ideology Dawkins is selling is the worship of competition. It is projecting a Thatcherite take on economics on to evolution. It&#x27;s not an impartial scientific view; it&#x27;s a political drama.&quot; In April 2009 Midgley reiterated her critical interpretation of &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; as part of a series of articles on Hobbes in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In her 2010 book &quot;The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene&quot;, she argues that &quot;simple one-sided accounts of human motives, such as the &quot;selfish gene&quot; tendency in recent neo-Darwinian thought, may be illuminating but are always unrealistic&quot;.

==Midgley in art==
Midgley is referred to in &quot;The Lives of Animals&quot; (1999), a work of fiction by the South African novelist J. M. Coetzee. The book has been likened to a cross between a short story and a philosophical dialogue, as Coetzee&#x27;s protagonist, Elizabeth Costello, often speaks at length about philosophical ideas. Many reviewers expressed bafflement at the text, which has an enigmatic and riddling style. As one reviewer noted, &quot;the reader is not quite sure whether he is intended to spot some confusion or contradiction or non-sequitur in [the protagonist&#x27;s] arguments.&quot; Other critics however have noted many affinities between &quot;The Lives of Animals&quot; and Midgley&#x27;s philosophy, and have used Midgley&#x27;s ideas to make sense of Coetzee&#x27;s work.

The main character, who also appears in Coetzee&#x27;s novel &quot;Elizabeth Costello&quot;, is concerned with the moral status of animals, a subject Midgley addressed in &quot;Animals and Why They Matter&quot;, and discusses at length the idea of sympathy as an ethical concept, a subject Midgley wrote about in &quot;Beast and Man&quot;. Andy Lamey wrote that the result of these and other similarities is that Coetzee&#x27;s work &quot;evoke[s] a particular conception of ethics, one very similar to that of the philosopher Mary Midgley. Such a view affords a central role to sympathy and is fundamentally opposed to a long-standing rival view, most clearly exemplified by the social contract tradition, which prioritizes an instrumental conception of rationality.&quot;

Coetzee and Midgley additionally shared a longstanding fascination with Robinson Crusoe. Coetzee retells the Crusoe story in his novel &quot;Foe&quot;, while Midgley wrote about Crusoe in her essay &quot;Duties Concerning Islands.&quot; Midgley&#x27;s essay argued for the idea that human beings can have ethical obligations to non-human entities such as animals and ecosystems, an idea also found in &quot;The Lives of Animals&quot;, &quot;Foe&quot; and many other works by Coetzee.

Midgley agreed to sit for sculptor Jon Edgar in Newcastle during 2006, as part of the Environment Triptych, along with heads of Richard Mabey and James Lovelock. This was exhibited at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 2013.

<text>Theatre X was an American theater company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Until its demise in 2004, it was one of the oldest operating experimental theater ensembles in the U.S.

==History==

The company formed in 1969 as an informal workshop by a group of UW–Milwaukee faculty and students. It became a professional company by 1971, touring throughout the United States and to Europe and Japan. It was named for the algebraic symbol x, which means an unknown quantity, thus implying a theater of unlimited possibility. The ensemble was a resident company at the Water Street Art Center in Milwaukee, where they rehearsed, performed and hosted traveling productions from other theater companies. The site soon included an art gallery and small press bookstore that years later became Woodland Pattern Book Center, as well as a grass roots outreach company, Friends Mime Theatre, which evolved into the Milwaukee Public Theatre. Finally, it moved into offices in the Broadway Theater Center in Milwaukee&#x27;s Historic Third Ward and remained there until its collapse.

Much of its early work was created improvisationally as an ensemble, with influences including The Living Theatre and Jerzy Grotowski. The company created over 60 new plays among its 180 productions. In its last two years, Theatre X&#x27;s board of directors gave then producing director David Ravel and artistic director John Schneider control over play selection and casting, which had previously involved the entire group, and then dissolved the acting company. This move away from an ensemble structure led to a public dispute when the board gave ensemble members John Kishline, Deborah Clifton and Marcie Hoffmann a forced leave of absence from acting in hopes of re-structuring the company, leaving only Schneider and Flora Coker as the remaining founding members. Though litigation was proposed, the lawsuit was dropped after it became too costly. Theatre X continued for 2 seasons but chose to turn off the lights in 2004.

Willem Dafoe was an early member of the ensemble and, when he stayed in New York to eventually join the Wooster Group, was replaced by Victor DeLorenzo, who later was one of the founders of Violent Femmes. Delorenzo was later replaced by David Rommel. John Sobczak, Cate Woodruff (then Pamela C. Woodruff) and Wesley Savick were also long-time members of Theatre X. Lory Lazarus, a member of Theatre X in the mid 1970s, went on to become a writer for Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Courage, the Cowardly Dog&quot; and a songwriter for &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; on PBS. Two of Theatre X&#x27;s founding members, Conrad Bishop and Elizabeth Fuller, went on to form The Independent Eye.

Theatre X won a 1978 Obie Award for the set design and lighting design for the New York City production of their original play &quot;A Fierce Longing&quot;, based on the life of Yukio Mishima.

<text>The IBM 1403 line printer was introduced as part of the IBM 1401 computer in 1959 and had an especially long life in the IBM product line. 

==Description==
The original model can print 600 lines of text per minute and can skip blank lines at up to 75 inches per second (190 cm/s), while the model 3 can print at up to 1400 lines per minute. The standard model has 120 print positions. An additional 12 positions are available as an option. A print chain with up to 15 copies of the character set spins horizontally in front of the ribbon and paper. Hammers strike the paper from behind at exactly the right moment to print a character as it goes by. In later models, the print chain is replaced by a print train; print slugs instead of being mounted on a chain are placed in a track.
The 1403 chain or train contains 240 characters, however numerous duplications allow a line to be printed in less than the 0.4 s required for one full rotation. The original standard &quot;A&quot; chain contains 48 different characters, repeated five times each. A &quot;preferred character set&quot; variant used in later models prints the same 48 characters, but varies the number of appearances: 10 digits appear eight times each, 26 upper-case letters appear four times each, and 12 special characters codice_1 appear eight (first four), four (middle four) or two (last four characters) times each.
Special chains or trains can be ordered for other character sets. Scientific users, for example, can use a chain that has the left parenthesis, the right parenthesis, and the plus sign in place of the per cent sign (%), the lozenge (⌑), and the ampersand (&amp;). The numerics chain has 15 copies each of only 16 characters. The &quot;T&quot; chain for general text has two copies of 120 characters, including upper-and lower-case letters and numerous special symbols.

The ink ribbon is a long roll the width of the print area positioned between the print chain and the paper. The roll comes in two parts: the feeder roll and take-up roll. The roll is constantly wound and rewound during printing.
Like most IBM printers of the era, the 1403 uses fan-folded paper with perforated edges for tractor feeding. A carriage control tape or, later, a buffer, under program control, specifies form length and the form line where printing on a new page is to begin so that paper of various sizes can be used.

The overstrike capability of the printer can be used to generate a wide range of grey-scale equivalents. Many images have been scanned, converted to text and therefore can be reproduced on the 1403, most notably the Mona Lisa.

These are noisy machines, especially when the cover is raised. It is possible to create text that uses the timing of the print hammers to generate desired frequencies and thus play recognizable music when that text is printed.

== History ==

Prior to the introduction of the model 1403, IBM printers utilized technology originally developed for their line of accounting machines. Models 402 and 405 use type bars. These are vertical bars, one for each print position. Each bar is one character wide with either the entire alphabet, including numerals and symbols, or just numerals and symbols only, molded into the front surface, in a single column. In printing, each bar is raised up until the correct character for that print position is opposite the paper, whereupon the bar is pushed toward the paper, so that the correct numeral or letter pressed against the ribbon, striking the paper much the way type slugs leave an impression on paper in a standard typewriter. This action is relatively slow, as it took time for each bar to be brought up into the correct position and then drop back down in preparation to print the next line.

In the model 407, each type bar is replaced with a type wheel, with the characters along the outside edge. To print, each wheel is rotated to the correct character position, then the entire wheel is pushed forward to strike the paper. This action is somewhat faster because the wheels are less massive than the bars and can be positioned more rapidly, allowing printing at up to 150 lines per minute. Although this is slow by later printing standards, the speed at which electromechanical accounting machines can read punched cards and perform their basic arithmetic functions means that no faster printing speeds are needed. The IBM 1132 was the last printer manufactured by IBM to use this technology.
When faster computers were developed, however, the speed of card reading, magnetic tape, and early disk drives, along with newer high speed transistorized circuits, means that processing can be done at a much higher speed, and a faster print mechanism is needed to match the resulting productivity. IBM&#x27;s early computers, such as the IBM 701, were developed for higher speed calculation than was possible with earlier electromechanical calculating machines. They did not have a demand for high speed printing, as the results of massive calculations produced very little printed output. Around the time that the 1403 was introduced, IBM&#x27;s line of computers had been largely divided into two lines, &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;business.&quot; However, as newer computers were being used for a greater variety of purposes, there was a need to print a greater variety of characters from a single device, including upper and lower case alphabets. With type bars and type wheels, changing character sets is impractical. The advent of the chain printer, as used in the 1403, allows the type chain assembly to be removed and replaced within a few minutes. With the cover open, the print unit is unlatched and swung open, the ribbon roll covering the front of the chain is removed, whereupon the print chain assembly can be unlatched and lifted out.

When it was first introduced, the 1401 computer system, of which the printer was a part, leased for $6,500 per month (equivalent to $54,000 in 2017) and IBM received 3,000 orders in the first month.

== Technology ==
Chain printing allows a single set of characters to pass horizontally across the front of the paper at high speed, with a ribbon the full width of the paper passing vertically between the chain and the front of the paper. Instead of pressing the characters toward the paper, individual type hammers behind the paper, one for each column on the page (120 or 132), push the paper from behind, causing the front of the paper at that spot to push forward into the ribbon with the character behind it, causing the paper to strike the character, rather than the other way around, as had been done in the past. Each hammer is moved by a powerful electromagnet, with its coil connected to a high current drive circuit, such that the hammer can be forced out to hit the paper within only a few milliseconds, at exactly the right time to strike the correct character on the chain as it came by.

The columns on the paper are spaced at the standard typewriter pitch of 10 characters per inch, 0.1″ per column. The characters on the chain are spaced 0.1505″ apart, so that for each 0.001″ movement of the chain, a new character aligns with a print column. Moving at 7.5 feet per second, one hammer might fire each , but they were never exactly simultaneous.

=== Character set ===
== Models ==
The IBM 1403 has the following models:
* Model 1: 100 print positions, maximum of 600 lines per minute, or 1285 with the Numerical Print Special Feature.
* Model 2: 132 print positions, maximum of 600 lines per minute, or 1285 with the Numerical Print Special Feature, or 750 with Universal Character Set.
* Model 3: 132 print positions, maximum of 1100 lines per minute, or 1400 with the Preferred or Universal Character Sets.
* Model 4: 100 print positions, maximum of 465 lines per minute.
* Model 5: 132 print positions, maximum of 465 lines per minute.
* Model 6: 120 print positions, maximum of 340 lines per minute, single-carriage.
* Model 7: 120 print positions, maximum of 600 lines per minute, single-carriage.
* Model N1: 132 print positions, maximum of 1100 lines per minute, or 1400 with Universal Character Set. The model N1 has a power-driven cover that reaches the floor to decrease noise.

Only models 2, 3, 7 and N1 can be attached to the IBM System/360 and its successors. Attachment is generally by means of the IBM 2821 Control Unit, but some 360 models include an integrated control unit for direct 1403 connection.

Only the Model 6 (340 LPM) or the Model 7 (600 LPM) can be attached to an IBM 1130.

== IBM 1404 ==
The 1404 printer is an IBM impact printer with &quot;all the basic features of the IBM 1403 Printer,&quot; with the added ability to print on card documents, such as punched cards.

The 1404 can print on continuous forms at 600 lines per minute, and on cards at 800 cards per minute. The mechanism can handle cards ranging from 51 columns to a full 80 columns, and can print cards two at a time. Up to 25 lines can be printed on a card. The printer can also &quot;interpret&quot; cards, that is, read the card and print what was punched.

The 1404 was originally introduced in 1960 as a peripheral for the IBM 1401 computing system. It was later able to attach to a System/360 through an IBM 2821 control unit.

== IBM 1416 ==
The IBM 1416 is an interchangeable train cartridge introduced with the 1403-N1 and also used with the IBM 3203. This means instead of using a chain of linked characters, the printer uses a train of unlinked characters. The cartridge allows the operator to change the font and/or character set arrangement being used by the printer. It is also possible to create a custom train with unique characters. Note that while the IBM 1403 Models 2 and 7 do offer a feature known as the Interchangeable Train Cartridge Adapter, which allows the operator to easily remove and insert a chain cartridge with a different font or character set arrangement, this feature does not have a separate machine type.

<text>The 1981 Ontario general election was held on March 19, 1981, to elect members of the 32nd Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, Canada.

The governing Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, led by Bill Davis, was re-elected for a twelfth consecutive term in office. The PCs finally won a majority government after winning only minorities in the 1975 and 1977 elections. The Liberal Party, led by Stuart Smith, was able to maintain its standing in the Legislature, while the New Democratic Party, led by Michael Cassidy, lost a significant number of seats, allowing the Tories to win a majority.

=== During the 31st Parliament of Ontario ===
==Campaign==

A number of unregistered parties also fielded candidates in this election.

There were a number of Rhinoceros Party candidates in the Toronto area, and the party may have also fielded candidates elsewhere in the province. The Workers Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist) a single candidate, Judy Darcy. Ronald G. Rodgers, founder of the Détente Party of Canada, contested a Toronto constituency.

Social Credit leader Reg Gervais announced prior to the election that he planned to run in Nickel Belt, but could not follow through and resigned at a meeting of nominated candidates where John Turmel was appointed interim leader of the Ontario Social Credit Party during the campaign, though there has never been independent confirmation of this (nor is it clear if the Ottawa-area candidacies of Turmel and Raymond Turmel and Serge Girard and Dale Alkerton and Andrew Dynowski were approved by the remaining few members of the official Social Credit Party of Ontario).

<text>Pierre Moscovici (, ; born 16 September 1957) is a French politician who served as the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs from 2014 to 2019. He previously served as Minister of Finance from 2012 to 2014 and as Minister for European Affairs between 1997 and 2002.

Previously a member of the Trotskyist group the Revolutionary Communist League, Moscovici joined the French Socialist Party (PS) in 1984 and has since that time been a member of the Departmental Council of Doubs and of the French Parliament and the European Parliament.

In May 2014 he was entrusted by the Prime Minister of France with a six-month mission to assess how European policies can better contribute to growth and employment. In July 2014 French President François Hollande proposed him to be France&#x27;s representative in the next European Commission. In September 2014, he was named as European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs by President-designate of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.

==Early life and education==
Born in Paris, Moscovici is the son of the influential Romanian Jewish social psychologist Serge Moscovici and of the Polish psychoanalyst Marie Bromberg-Moscovici.

Moscovici obtained his Baccalauréat at the Lycée Condorcet in 1974, a DEA in economics and in philosophy, and he graduated from Sciences Po Paris and the École nationale d&#x27;administration, where he studied under Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who became a friend and mentor in politics. He was a president of &quot;À gauche en Europe&quot;, a group founded by Strauss-Kahn and Michel Rocard and also created his own group &quot;Besoin de Gauche&quot;.

After graduating from the École nationale d&#x27;administration in 1984, Moscovici was appointed to the Court of Audit, of which he is currently a senior member.

==Political career==
===Early political career===
Initially active in the Revolutionary Communist League, he left in 1984 to join the PS and, in 1986, became secretary of the &quot;experts&#x27; group&quot; created by Claude Allègre.

In 1988, he moved on to the Ministry for National Education in Minister Lionel Jospin&#x27;s cabinet, first as conseiller technique, then as chargé de mission.

From 1990 to 1994, he headed the Public Service Modernisation and Financing Department at the Commissariat général du Plan – French Planning Office.

=== Member of the European Parliament ===
From 1994 to 1997, Moscovici was a Member of the European Parliament. In parliament, he served on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In addition to his committee assignments, he was part of the Parliament&#x27;s delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico.

=== Minister delegate for European Affairs ===
Elected to the French Parliament from the Doubs département in 1997, he went on to become a Member of the Franche-Comté Regional Council from 1998 to 2004, and of the Doubs département General Council from 1994 to 2002.

From 1997 to 2002, Moscovici was Minister delegate for European Affairs in the government of Lionel Jospin. At the request of Chirac, he represented the French authorities at the Convention on the Future of Europe in 2002.

=== Member of the European Parliament ===
On 20 July 2004, Moscovici was elected one of the 14 Vice-presidents of the European Parliament and was re-elected on 17 January 2007. In addition, he served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Of Romanian origin, he was one of the supporters of Romania&#x27;s EU integration. He stated that he identifies itself as a half Romanian.

=== Member of the French National Assembly ===
From 2007 to 2012, Moscovici was a Member of the French National Assembly (4th constituency in the Doubs), serving on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and subsequently the Finance Committee. He also served as vice-president of the Assembly&#x27;s Committee on European Affairs.

He was President of the Pays de Montbéliard Agglomération (PMA – Greater Montbéliard Authority) from 2008 to 2012.

In 2011, Moscovici endorsed François Hollande and ran his successful campaign for the 2012 French presidential election. In the subsequent legislative election, Moscovici was re-elected to the National Assembly from the 4th constituency in the Doubs.

Moscovici served as a Member of the French National Assembly. In May 2014 he was entrusted by the Prime Minister of France with a six-month mission to assess how European policies can better contribute to growth and employment.

=== Minister for Finance and Economy ===
Moscovici served as France&#x27;s Minister for Finance and Economy from May 2012 to April 2014.

Ahead of the Socialist Party&#x27;s 2012 convention in Toulouse, Moscovici publicly endorsed Harlem Désir as candidate to succeed Martine Aubry at the party&#x27;s leadership.

Moscovici was among the guests invited to the state dinner hosted by U.S. President Barack Obama in honor of Hollande at the White House on 11 February 2014.

== Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs ==
In July 2014 President Francois Hollande nominated Moscovici to be France&#x27;s candidate for the European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker. Juncker subsequently nominated Moscovici as Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs.

Moscovici served as Commissioner from 2014 until 2019. In this capacity, he was in charge of the application of the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as ensuring the economic soundness of Commission proposals and deepening the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union to create the conditions for jobs, growth and investment, and encouraging further structural reforms. On taxation matters, he was responsible for developing a value added tax system at the European level, improving the functioning of the internal market in both direct and indirect taxation and fighting tax fraud and tax evasion. His responsibilities also included the development and management of an efficient European Union Customs Union.

By 2017, Moscovici openly advocated a fully formed eurozone finance minister, and admitted that he would be interested in that position. In the meantime, the as Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs should also assume the presidency of the Eurogroup.

In a 2018 letter to Sergei Stanishev, then chairman of the Party of European Socialists (PES), Moscovici ruled himself out of the race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker and become the commission&#x27;s next president, &quot;due to profound disagreements with [the French Socialist Party’s] political line and strategy on Europe.&quot;

==Wiretapping by NSA==
In 2015, WikiLeaks revealed that the U.S. National Security Agency wiretapped Moscovici&#x27;s communication during his time as Minister of Finance.

<text>Central railway station is located on the North Coast line in Queensland, Australia. It is the principal station on the City network and is located in the north of the Brisbane central business district. Central station is one of four inner city stations that form a core corridor through the centre of Brisbane.

==History==

The first building for Central railway station was a structure of wood and corrugated galvanised iron, and opened on 18 August 1889 as the terminus of the line when it was extended from Roma Street railway station. In 1891, the tunnel to Brunswick Street station (now Fortitude Valley) was opened so trains could run directly from Central to northern destinations.

An elegant new station was constructed and opened in 1899 with arches of corrugated galvanised iron over the platforms and a portico on Ann Street. A new entrance with its distinctive row of clocks was constructed in 1901 in sandstone from nearby quarries. In 1904, Central had the only electro-pneumatic system in Australia for changing points and signals.

The station had two through and two bay platforms. In 1909, the bay platforms were converted to through platforms.

In the 1940s, an American soldier was arrested after stabbing a Brisbane woman and a group of Australian soldiers. 

Ann Street was widened in 1954 for the construction of government offices which required the portico to be demolished. The vaulted roof was removed in 1966 and replaced by awnings over each platform.

Between 1968 and 1970, the station was redeveloped with office towers built over the platforms at the Edward Street end, involving the demolition of the 1901 entrance buildings and the construction of a modern pedestrian retail concourse behind the old station buildings. Further redevelopment saw the Sheraton Hotel Towers (now Sofitel Brisbane) constructed in 1984 over the remaining platforms.

As part of the quadruplication of the line from Roma Street station to Bowen Hills, Platforms 5 and 6 opened on 11 June 1996.

In early 2017, a major upgrade to the station commenced.

==Station configuration==
Central railway station is located at the northern end of the Brisbane central business district on Ann Street, directly opposite Anzac Square. Pedestrian access is available from the main entrance at the corner of Ann and Edward Streets, the pedestrian subway connecting Anzac Square with Upper Edward Street and from the corner of Ann Street and Creek Street. Lesser used access points are located off Wickham Terrace and from Edward Street via the courtyard of the Railway Centre.

There is elevator access to Central Station from Ann Street opposite the Shrine of Remembrance, and from Wickham Terrace on the northern corner of the complex. There are also escalators to Central station from Anzac Square Arcade, next to Anzac Square.

==Services==
Central station is served by all suburban and interurban City network lines. Also see Inner City timetable.

<doc id="852979" wikidata="Q14646758" url="?curid=852979" title="Wisconsin Death Trip">
<text>Wisconsin Death Trip is a 1973 historical nonfiction book by Michael Lesy, originally published by Pantheon Books. It charts numerous sordid, tragic, and bizarre incidents that took place in and around Jackson County, Wisconsin between 1885 and 1900, primarily in the town of Black River Falls. The events are outlined through actual written historical documents—primarily articles published in the town newspaper—with additional narration by Lesy, as well as excerpts from works by Hamlin Garland, Sinclair Lewis, and Glenway Wescott, which thematically parallel the incidents depicted. The text is accompanied by contemporaneous photographs and portraits taken in Black River Falls by photographer Charles Van Schaick. Thematically, the book emphasizes the harsh aspects of Midwestern rural life under the pressures of crime, pestilence, mental illness, and urbanization.

&quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; developed a cult following in the years following its publication. In 1999, British filmmaker James Marsh adapted the book into a critically-acclaimed docudrama film of the same name. It was subsequently reprinted in 1991 by Anchor Books, and by the University of New Mexico Press in 2000.

==Overview==
&quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; charts myriad grim and bizarre occurrences that took place in and around Jackson County, Wisconsin—in particular, the city of Black River Falls—between 1885 and 1910. In addition to a disintegration of the local economy after the closure of several industrial mines, the populace is plagued by a diphtheria epidemic that claims the lives of numerous children, as well as a series of violent crimes, murders, suicides, arsons, religious delusions, mental illness, and superstitions. The vandalism crimes of Mary Sweeny are also showcased throughout.

The book is divided in five sections, with the opening and closing chapters focusing primarily on births, children, and child death; the middle three chapters focus on an array of incidents involving adults. The various occurrences are relayed via actual articles originally published in the local newspaper, the &quot;Badger State Banner&quot;, by editor Frank Cooper and his son George, as well as written documents from a medical records keeper from Mendota State Hospital, a town historian, and a town gossip. Lesy&#x27;s own narration is also incorporated, along with selections from writings by Hamlin Garland, Sinclair Lewis, and Glenway Wescott.

Accompanying the text are approximately 200 photographs and portraits by Charles Van Schaick, a German immigrant who served as the Justice of Peace and town photographer for Black River Falls. The book emphasizes the harsh elements of Midwestern rural life during the expansion of the American Frontier and imminent urbanization, and their role in sordid incidents that unfolded in and around the community.

==Development==
Michael Lesy began developing &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; while studying for a master&#x27;s degree at the University of Wisconsin in the late 1960s, during which he came across a collection of portraits and photographs by Black River Falls photographer Charles Van Schaick—taken between 1890 and 1900—that had been preserved by the Wisconsin Historical Society. The collection had been acquired by the historical society in 1970, after having been left stored in Van Schaick&#x27;s unused studio for thirty years following his death in 1940. Van Schaik had left behind a total of approximately 30,000 glass plate negatives, approximately 8,000 of which were salvaged by the historical society. &quot;I thought some of the studio portraits were pretty amazing,&quot; Lesy recalled. &quot;The whole experience that day seemed like a separate universe.&quot;

Inspired by the images, Lesy began researching the history of the town via microforms of contemporaneous newspaper articles from the Black River Falls newspaper, the &quot;Badger State Banner&quot;, which detailed numerous accounts of economic turmoil, crime, disease, mental illness, and violence. Lesy selected approximately 200 of Van Schaick&#x27;s photographs for inclusion in the book, which he originally presented as his doctoral thesis at Rutgers University.

==Publication history==
Pantheon Books first published &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; in 1973. It has been reprinted several times in the United States, first by Anchor Books in January 1991, and later by the University of New Mexico Press in January 2000. An eBook version was released by the University of New Mexico Press in August 2016.

==Film adaptation==

The 1999 film adaptation was directed by James Marsh as a docudrama. It was shot primarily in black-and-white, with contrasting color sequences of modern life in the area. It combined re-enactments of some of the events described in the book with a voice-over narration by Ian Holm. Its visual style was intended to carry the content of the film; as Marsh said: &quot;I wanted to convey in the film the real pathos contained in a four line newspaper report that simultaneously records and dismisses the end of someone&#x27;s life.&quot;

==Legacy==
In the years following its publication, &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; developed a cult following and has been cited as an inspiration for numerous other works of music, literature, and film.

The book inspired a number of musical works, including the opera &quot;Black River&quot; by Conrad Susa, which was composed in 1975 and revised 1981; the 1999 &quot;dramatic cantata&quot; &quot;Songs of Madness and Sorrow&quot; by Daron Hagen; and the 1999 album &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; by the industrial metal band Static-X. British post-punk band Echo &amp; the Bunnymen used photographs from the book as artwork for their 2001 album &quot;Flowers&quot;, as well as its singles. A song performed by Jerry Joseph was inspired by the title of the film. Most recently, the book was adapted into a bluegrass/roots-rock opera by Tim Raphael and composer Jeff Berkson, which had its world premiere at Georgetown University&#x27;s Davis Performing Arts Center on February 1, 2008. The soundtrack for the film adaptation of the book features original music by DJ Shadow and John Cale.

The Australian author Rod Jones cites &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; as an inspiration for his novel &quot;Billy Sunday&quot;, and the American author Robert Goolrick also cites it as an inspiration for his novel &quot;A Reliable Wife.&quot; Stephen King&#x27;s book of novellas, &quot;Full Dark, No Stars&quot;, cites &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; as the inspiration for the story &quot;1922&quot;. The American author Stewart O&#x27;Nan &quot;acknowledges his great debt to Michael Lesy,&quot; citing &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; as an inspiration for his novel &quot;A Prayer for the Dying&quot;. (NB: at least one early Picador edition misattributes this to &quot;Michael Levy&quot;.)

In commentary on the two-disc DVD release of the Bob Dylan biopic &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, director Todd Haynes said that much of the imagery for the town of Riddle in the Richard Gere segment of the film was inspired by Lesy&#x27;s book. Director Walter Murch also used the book as an historical source for the 1985 cult classic &quot;Return to Oz&quot;.

The creators of the show &quot;The Heart, She Holler&quot; have discussed being influenced by the book in the creation of their show about rural America.

Author Neil Gaiman cites the book as &quot;hugely influential in the headspace&quot; that led to his 2001 novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, later adapted into a television series of the same name.

<text>Terrance Michael &quot;Terry&quot; Brunk (born December 12, 1964) is an American retired professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Sabu. He is known for his trademark style of hardcore wrestling, which he pioneered in his time with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1995 to 2000. He is a three-time World Heavyweight Champion having held the ECW World Heavyweight Championship twice and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship once.

Under the tutelage of his uncle Ed &quot;The Sheik&quot; Farhat, Brunk began his career wrestling in the North American independent scene in 1985 under the name of Sabu, before traveling to Japan, competing in Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), winning several championships, including the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. He returned to the United States in 1995, briefly working for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), before beginning his most well-known stint in ECW, where he quickly became a fixture of the promotion. During his time in ECW, he became a two-time ECW World Heavyweight Champion and a one-time ECW World Television Champion. He would have both a feud and an alliance with The Tazmaniac, defeated him for the ECW FTW Championship and winning the ECW World Tag Team Championship with him. In 1997, Sabu began a tag team with Rob Van Dam, winning the ECW Tag Team Championship twice.

After leaving ECW, Sabu wrestled in several national promotions, winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 2000. In 2006, he was hired by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as part of their new third brand, a rebooted version of ECW. Sabu would wrestle for WWE until he was fired in 2007. He also became a regular wrestler in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling since the creation of the promotion in 2002.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== Early career (1985–1991) ===
Brunk was trained by his uncle, Ed &quot;The Sheik&quot; Farhat, and was initially trained to be a technical wrestler. He began his wrestling career in 1985 in Farhat&#x27;s promotion, Big Time Wrestling, and was billed as being from Saudi Arabia under the ring names &quot;Sabu the Elephant Boy&quot; (use of &quot;The Elephant Boy&quot; was later dropped) and &quot;Terry S.R.&quot; (the &quot;S.R.&quot; standing for &quot;Sheik&#x27;s Revenge&quot;). During the 1980s, Brunk wrestled for various independent promotions in Memphis, Michigan, Ohio, Canada, and Hawaii. He was rarely billed under his real name, in order to avoid confusion with the similarly named wrestler Terry Funk, but has wrestled under his real name in Hawaii.

=== United States Wrestling Association (1991) ===
In 1991, Sabu made a few appearances for United States Wrestling Association as Samu. He feuded with Jeff Jarrett and Robert Fuller.

===World Wrestling Federation (1993)===
Sabu made three appearances for the World Wrestling Federation. He defeated Scott Taylor in a dark match before &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; on October 18, 1993. He lost to Owen Hart the next night for a dark match at a &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping and on the October 20 defeated Scott Taylor again in a dark match at a &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; taping.

=== Frontier Martial–Arts Wrestling (1991–1994) ===
In 1991, Sabu made his first tour of Japan with Frontier Martial–Arts Wrestling (FMW). While wrestling for FMW, Sabu received many of the scars on his arms and torso for which he became famous. Brunk cleared rumors that the scars were self-induced in a shoot interview with RF Video, confirming that they were a result of numerous hardcore matches he was involved in, including participating in over two dozen no-rope barbed wire death matches. In May 1992, Sabu teamed with his uncle, the Sheik, in a &quot;Ring of Fire Deathmatch&quot; against Atsushi Onita and Tarzan Goto. The match was set in a ring where the ropes were replaced with barbed wire with sheets soaked in gas wrapped around it. As the match started, the ring crew lit the sheets on fire using torches. They were in the ring for about a minute before all men got out of the ring due to the intense heat. The match ended with no winner. Sabu said in an interview that the ring burned for 19 hours.

Sabu often competed in Japanese hardcore matches, where he teamed with The Sheik, Tiger Jeet Singh and Horace Boulder. Sabu feuded with the likes of Tarzan Goto and Atsushi Onita in FMW. His final match in FMW was a loss to the debuting Hayabusa at the 1994 Summer Spectacular.

===Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993-1995)===
====Double champion (1993–1994)====
Sabu debuted in Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in October 1993 as a villain at NWA Bloodfest by defeating The Tazmaniac. One of the most notable aspects of Sabu&#x27;s early career was his refusal to speak, a gimmick that he inherited from The Sheik (who never spoke English in public to protect kayfabe). In his early career, Sabu was billed as being from Saudi Arabia, or Bombay, India (in real life he is a second generation Lebanese American from a suburb of Detroit). In ECW, however, he was clearly heard speaking in the ring on several occasions and it was fairly common knowledge that Brunk was an American citizen from birth. This led to a joke at kayfabe&#x27;s expense when Sabu began to be billed as hailing from &quot;Bombay, Michigan&quot;.

Brunk revealed in a shoot promo and in the documentary film &quot;Forever Hardcore&quot; that in fact it was not Paul Heyman that brought him into ECW but that he was at the right place at the right time. He was referred by a friend to Tod Gordon. According to the storyline, Sabu, who at that time often arrived to the ring by his handler 911, was an uncontrollable madman strapped to a gurney and with a Hannibal Lecter-style face mask while trying to break free (he claimed to hate this part of his gimmick as he was normally tired before he started his match). Sabu could only be released from his bonds to wrestle his matches. Sabu also quickly became synonymous with table-breaking at this time; if a table was not broken during the match, Sabu would break a table with his own body after the bell had sounded, sometimes leading to 911 having to restrain Sabu during backstage interviews if a table was present.

Sabu would quickly rise to main event status upon his debut. In his second match with the promotion, he defeated Shane Douglas for the ECW Heavyweight Championship. Sabu made his first successful title defense against Tazmaniac, which aired on the November 30 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. Sabu then headlined the inaugural November to Remember event on November 13 by teaming with Road Warrior Hawk in a title versus title dream partner tag team match against Terry Funk and King Kong Bundy, with Sabu&#x27;s ECW Heavyweight Championship and Funk&#x27;s ECW Television Championship on the line. Sabu pinned Funk to win the Television Championship after Bundy turned on Funk. As a result, Sabu became a double champion. The rivalry between Sabu and Funk intensified as Sabu lost the Heavyweight Championship to Funk at Holiday Hell.

Sabu received a rematch for the Heavyweight Championship against Funk in a Three Way Dance at The Night the Line Was Crossed on February 5, 1994, also involving Shane Douglas. The match ended in a sixty-minute time limit draw, which meant that Funk retained the title. Sabu would then continue to retain the Television Championship against the likes of Pat Tanaka and Mike Awesome, before losing the title to The Tazmaniac, which aired on the March 15 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. After the title loss, Sabu continued his feud with Funk, defeating him on the April 19 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. At When Worlds Collide, Sabu teamed with Bobby Eaton to defeat Funk and Arn Anderson to conclude the rivalry.

====Teaming with The Tazmaniac (1994–1995)====
At Heat Wave, Sabu turned into a fan favorite by forming a tag team with The Tazmaniac to defeat The Pitbulls. Later that night, Sabu challenged Shane Douglas for the Heavyweight Championship, but failed to win after losing by count-out. Sabu and Tazmaniac would begin feuding with The Triple Threat (Shane Douglas, Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko), which led to Sabu facing Benoit in the main event of November to Remember, headlining ECW&#x27;s premier event for the second consecutive year. The match prematurely ended when Benoit gave Sabu a back body drop and, expecting his opponent to land face-first, Sabu rotated himself in mid-air to attempt to land on his back. This injured Sabu&#x27;s spinal cord resulting in nerve damage. However, Sabu returned to action two weeks later, and continued to wrestle Triple Threat in various matches, which saw Sabu and Tazmaniac defeat Dean and Joe Malenko on the November 22 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;.

In 1995, Sabu and Tazmaniac began feuding with The Public Enemy over the ECW World Tag Team Championship, failing to win the titles on the January 3 and January 31 episodes of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. Sabu and Tazmaniac finally defeated Public Enemy in a double tables match at the Double Tables to win the World Tag Team Championship on February 4. However, Sabu and Tazmaniac lost the titles to Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko, just three weeks later at Return of the Funker. Sabu would soon wrestle his last match of his first tenure in ECW on the March 28 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot; by defeating Mikey Whipwreck.

The following month in April, after being scheduled to compete in the main event of Three Way Dance for the World Tag Team Championship, Sabu no–showed the event to accept a booking in Japan for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), which led Paul Heyman to publicly and legitimately fire Sabu at the event. Sabu stated in the &quot;Forever Hardcore&quot; documentary that he by then had a career wrestling in Japan and now only wrestled once every so often for ECW; thus, he chose Japan over ECW.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1995) ===
Sabu wrestled for New Japan Pro-Wrestling throughout 1995, making a total of 64 appearances. He made his debut on January 4 in the Tokyo Dome, teaming with Masahiro Chono to defeat Junji Hirata and Tatsumi Fujinami. Sabu and Chono teamed together on several more occasions to face Heisei Ishingun.

On May 3, 1995, Sabu defeated Koji Kanemoto at Wrestling Dontaku in the Fukuoka Dome to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Kanemoto on June 14 in Tokyo&#x27;s Nippon Budokan in a bout where Kanemoto&#x27;s UWA World Welterweight Championship was also on the line. He went on to face Gran Hamada in a series of matches, culminating in Sabu defeating Gran Hamada to win the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship on November 23, 1995, in the Todoroki Arena in Kawasaki. He held the championship for just over a week, losing to El Samurai on December 1, 1995, in Niigata City.

Sabu made his final appearance with NJPW on December 11, 1995, in Osaka, teaming with Hiro Saito to defeat Dean Malenko and Wild Pegasus.

===World Championship Wrestling (1995)===
Sabu made his WCW debut on the September 11, 1995, episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; against Alex Wright. Sabu won the match, but the decision was reversed when, after the match, he put Wright through a table. Sabu continued to wrestle some of the cruiserweights in WCW in the early days of the division, including a match against Mr. J.L. at Halloween Havoc. Sabu came out victorious against Mr. J.L. and following the match Sabu&#x27;s uncle Sheik shot J.L. in the face with his trademark fireball. His last match in WCW was against Disco Inferno, which Sabu won.

=== Big Japan and All Japan Pro Wrestling (1996-1997) ===
Sabu returned to Japan to work for Big Japan Pro Wrestling in March 1996. He had an 18-match winning streak first defeating Jason Knight on March 13 to June 4 losing to Kazuo Sakurada&#x27;s Kendo Nagasaki.

He made his debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling in November 1996 teaming with Gary Albright. In 1997, he teamed with Rob Van Dam.

In the summer of 1996, Sabu had planned on signing with the WWF. He was the original choice for The Sultan gimmick but rejected the offer when he learned that he was gonna be managed by The Iron Sheik instead of his uncle The Original Sheik and the gimmick was given to Fatu.

=== Return to ECW (1995-2000)===
====Various feuds (1995–1997)====

Sabu returned to ECW at November to Remember, defeating Hack Meyers in his first match in the promotion in eight months. He would embark on a winning streak against the likes of Cactus Jack at Holiday Hell, Stevie Richards at House Party, and Mr. Hughes at Big Apple Blizzard Blast. This led to Sabu challenging 2 Cold Scorpio for the World Television Championship. Sabu received various title shots against Scorpio at CyberSlam, Just Another Night, and Big Ass Extreme Bash, but the matches ended in twenty-minute time limit draws.

He eventually engaged in matches and a lengthy feud with Rob Van Dam after defeating him in a no time limit match at Hostile City Showdown. However, RVD insulted Sabu by refusing to shake hands with him after the match. As a result, a respect match took place between the two at A Matter of Respect. Sabu lost the match and was thus forced to shake hands with RVD, but RVD refused by saying &quot;not only do I not respect you, you&#x27;re a piece of shit&quot;. The rivalry between Sabu and RVD continued as Sabu defeated the latter in a standard match at Hardcore Heaven, a stretcher match at The Doctor Is In, and a grudge match at Unlucky Lottery, after which Sabu finally earned RVD&#x27;s respect. RVD was about to shake Sabu&#x27;s hand but The Can-Am Express attacked the two, leading to RVD and Sabu facing Can-Am Express at When Worlds Collide, a match which ended in a thirty-minute time limit draw. However, RVD and Sabu defeated Can-Am Express in a rematch at High Incident.

Sabu and RVD subsequently began teaming with each other and ended their rivalry. They began pursuing the World Tag Team Championship, facing The Eliminators in a #1 contender&#x27;s match at November to Remember. The match ended in a time limit draw and both teams faced the reigning champions The Gangstas in an immediate three-way elimination match, which Gangstas won. RVD and Sabu continued to feud with Eliminators over the titles in 1997 after the latter team won the tag team titles. They failed to win the titles from Eliminators in a standard tag team match at Crossing the Line Again and a Tables and Ladders match at CyberSlam. In the meantime, Sabu&#x27;s former tag team partner Tazmaniac (who had shortened his name to &quot;Taz&quot;) began to publicly challenge Sabu at every given opportunity, but got no response. After a year of call-outs and insults from Taz, Paul Heyman revealed that he had asked Sabu, as a friend, to ignore Taz&#x27;s challenge. This standoff culminated in a grudge match at ECW&#x27;s first pay-per-view, Barely Legal, which Taz won. Following the match, Taz&#x27;s manager Bill Alfonso turned on him and sided with Sabu and RVD. This resulted in a double turn as Taz became a fan favorite while Sabu turned heel. Sabu and Taz continued to feud on and off for the remainder of Taz&#x27;s ECW career. Sabu would continue his rivalry with Taz by defeating him in a rematch at Wrestlepalooza.

Shortly after, Sabu competed in a no-Rope barbed wire match against Terry Funk for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Born to be Wired, a match which was promoted as being &quot;too extreme even for ECW&quot;. In one of the most memorable moments in ECW history, Sabu attempted the &quot;Air Sabu&quot; corner splash on Funk, Terry moved and Sabu ended up colliding violently into the wire which tore open his biceps. He then asked his manager Bill Alfonso for some tape and after Alfonso went to get some Sabu began to tape the approximately 10 inch gash up. Funk has stated that, to this day, he has never seen anything like what Sabu did that night. The match ended with both men so badly tangled up together in the barbed wire that it took several ring technicians armed with wire cutters to free them from the predicament (on the DVD &quot;Bloodsport – ECW&#x27;s Most Violent Matches&quot; released by World Wrestling Entertainment, Paul Heyman said that the match was &quot;so gruesome, I never ever dared to schedule another one like it&quot;, and that they never had another Barbed-Wire match in ECW because &quot;no one could top that one – and in good conscience, I never wanted anyone to try&quot;). Sabu went on to win the match, winning the title for a second time. However, just eight days later, Sabu lost the title to Shane Douglas in a three-way elimination match, also involving Funk at Hardcore Heaven. Sabu received a rematch against Douglas for the title at The Homecoming, but lost.

====Teaming with Rob Van Dam (1997–2000)====

In the mid-1997, Sabu was included in the WWF invasion angle, in which ECW wrestlers invaded WWF&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; program and held ECW-style matches and angles on the show. One memorable moment occurred at this show when Sabu appeared during a match and prepared for an aerial move off the &quot;R&quot; in the &quot;RAW&quot; lettered entryway onto Team Taz members, but accidentally fell off the &quot;R&quot;. This was not planned which led to Sabu landing on top of Team Taz members and becoming an inside joke between him and Taz backstage. This was incorporated in ECW, as Sabu, RVD and Alfonso began promoting the virtues of the WWF product over ECW&#x27;s. Sabu and RVD feuded with ECW loyalists Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman during this period, and were joined by Jerry Lawler from WWF.

RVD and Sabu defeated Dreamer and Sandman in the first major meeting of the two teams at Orgy of Violence. After that, RVD and Sabu teamed with Lawler to take on the team of Dreamer, Sandman and Rick Rude in a steel cage match at Heat Wave. However, Rude turned on his teammates by attacking them and the match ended in a no contest. As a result, Sabu engaged in a lengthy feud with Sandman, resulting in a series of matches, as Sabu defeated him in a Tables and Ladders match at November to Remember, lost to him in a Stairway to Hell match at the 1998 House Party, and defeated him again in a Dueling Canes match at Living Dangerously to conclude the rivalry. Shortly after the event, RVD and Sabu turned into fan favorites. At Wrestlepalooza, Sabu challenged RVD to a match for the World Television Championship, which ended in a thirty-minute time limit draw.

On the July 1 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, Sabu and RVD defeated Chris Candido and Lance Storm to win the World Tag Team Championship, beginning Sabu&#x27;s second individual reign with the title. Sabu and RVD held the title for nearly four months, retaining the titles against various ECW teams such as Hardcore Chair Swingin&#x27; Freaks (Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney), Full Blooded Italians, and The Dudley Boyz throughout the summer of 1998. They also defeated the Japanese team of Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki at Heat Wave. RVD and Sabu finally lost the titles to Dudley Boyz on the October 28 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. Around the same time, RVD and Sabu joined forces with former rival Taz to feud with The Triple Threat and formed a short-lived alliance to counter the faction called New Triple Threat. The rivalry culminated in a six-man tag team match in the main event of November to Remember, in which New Triple Threat defeated Triple Threat.

At the ECW/FMW Supershow II in Japan, RVD and Sabu defeated Dudley Boyz to win their second World Tag Team Championship as a team, while it was Sabu&#x27;s third individual title reign. On the December 23 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, Sabu defeated Taz and Justin Credible in a three-way elimination match to win the FTW Heavyweight Championship after Taz put Sabu on top of him. As a result, Sabu began feuding with Taz in early 1999, stemming from a broken jaw and a broken neck that Brunk suffered during a match against Taz in December 1998. The injury occurred when Brunk took a Taz-Plex through a table and landed incorrectly. Sabu avenged that by interfering in Taz&#x27;s match against Shane Douglas for the World Heavyweight Championship at Guilty as Charged, attacked both men and left. After that, RVD and Sabu retained the World Tag Team Championship against Hardcore Chair Swingin&#x27; Freaks at House Party. Sabu&#x27;s rivalry with Taz led to the two competing in a falls count anywhere title unification match for Sabu&#x27;s FTW Championship and Taz&#x27;s ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Living Dangerously event. Taz won the match to unify both titles. Sabu would begin wearing a neck brace and take some time off, resulting in his partner RVD defending the World Tag Team Championship against D-Von Dudley in a singles match on the April 23 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, which Dudley won. As a result, Dudley Boyz won the titles.

In the summer of 1999, Sabu began a feud with Justin Credible, wrestling him in numerous matches at live events for various months. The rivalry led to a match between the two at Anarchy Rulz in September, which Credible won. Sabu would then challenge his tag team partner Rob Van Dam for the World Television Championship on the November 19 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot; and the November 26 episode of &quot;ECW on TNN&quot;, but failed to win the title both times. After defeating Chris Candido at November to Remember, Sabu continued his rivalry with RVD as he pursued the World Television Championship, unsuccessfully challenging RVD for the World Television Championship at Guilty as Charged on January 9, 2000. This would be Sabu&#x27;s final pay-per-view appearance in ECW. On the January 30 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, Sabu wrestled his last televised match in ECW, in which he defeated C.W. Anderson. Sabu&#x27;s last match in ECW took place on February 26, in which he defeated Scott D&#x27;Amore. After that, Sabu left ECW.

===Independent circuit (2000-2002)===
After leaving ECW, Sabu went to compete in the independent circuit. He worked for promotions such as Xtreme Pro Wrestling, IWA Mid-South, Stampede Wrestling, Border City Wrestling, and others. On April 29, 2000, he won a tournament for the vacated XPW World Heavyweight Championship defeating John Kronus in the first round, Damien Steele in the second and The Messiah in the finals. He was the only champion to defend the title outside of the States. He would hold the title for a year until it was taken away in May 2001 by Josh Lazie when Sabu was not present for an event. He would return to All Japan Pro Wrestling in 2000 as a singles competitor. In 2001, he competed against Abdullah the Butcher and Giant Kimala.

On July 8, 2001, he defeated Angel at ECW Reunion Show in Buffalo, New York. In 2002, he worked for Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling. He won the 3PW World Heavyweight Championship defeating Gary Wolfe on October 19. He would drop the title to Wolfe on December 28.

===Return to Frontier Martial–Arts Wrestling (1997-2002)===
Sabu returned to Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling on December 22, 1997, when he defeated ECW rival The Sandman at Super Extreme Wrestling War 1997 at Tokyo&#x27;s Korakuen Hall. Then on December 13, 1998, he and Rob Van Dam defeated the Dudley Boyz to retain the ECW World Tag Team Titles at ECW/FMW Supershow. He would team up with Super Leather in a few tag team matches during 1999.
On February 3, 2002, Sabu defeated former ECW wrestlers The Sandman and Vic Grimes in a three-way dance. The next day was his last match with FMW was when he teamed with Tetsuhiro Kuroda and lost to The Sandman and Kodo Fuyuki for the vacated WEW Tag Team titles. This would be the promotion last event as it went bankrupt on the 15th.

=== World Wrestling All-Stars (2002, 2003)===
Sabu competed for the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) in a number of events during 2002 and 2003. This included four appearances on PPV and a number of memorable matches. His first appearance was at Revolution PPV in Las Vegas in February 2002. He faced Devon Storm in a hardcore match. He was defeated in this match after his manager Bill Alfonso accidentally hit him with a chair after Storm moved out the way. After the match Sabu and Storm continued to fight onto the ring entrance way. Sabu placed Storm on a table and leaped from the entrance way through Storm and the table. This feud continued on the next PPV, the Eruption, in Australia in April. Sabu fought Storm in a steel cage match. The action spilled out of the ring and the cage with Sabu gaining the victory after leaping from the top of the cage through Storm, who was placed on top of two tables on top of each other.

Next up Sabu took part in WWA European tour of November–December 2002. This included the Retribution PPV in Glasgow, which was broadcast two months later in February 2003. On this tour and PPV he fought former fellow ECW stars Perry Saturn and Simon Diamond in a three-way hardcore match. Sabu took the victory in each of these matches, usually gaining the pinfall over Diamond after Saturn left the match to defend his companion. His final appearance for the WWA came in their last PPV, The Reckoning, in New Zealand. During this tour he first fought Shane Douglas but due to injury he did not face him at the PPV. Instead, Douglas came to the ring and eventually allowed Joe E Legend to face Sabu instead. Sabu won this match, his second and last WWA match ever. When the All World Wrestling League began in April 2003 (a spin-off of Big Time Wrestling), which was run by Eddie &amp; Tom Farhat, Sabu joined them for a while, before he left for another territory.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2006)===
====Early appearances and injury (2002–2004)====
Sabu debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on July 17, 2002, defeating Jerry &quot;Malice&quot; Tuite in a ladder match. The next week he faced Ken Shamrock in a ladder match which was declared a No Contest when Malice interfered.

In 2004, Sabu teamed with Raven to defeat Raven&#x27;s former &quot;Gathering&quot; protégés, CM Punk and Julio Dinero. In March, he began feuding with Monty Brown and Abyss, who outnumbered him on several occasions after Raven failed to &quot;watch his back&quot;. Eventually Raven challenged Sabu to an empty arena match to be held on June 9, but Sabu refused to wrestle him, claiming that he had promised his uncle, Ed &quot;The Sheik&quot; Farhat, that he would never fight Raven. Raven then waged a campaign against Sabu, disrespecting the memory of his uncle and assaulting Sabu&#x27;s friend Sonjay Dutt, until Sabu finally broke and attacked him on July 23. Raven defeated Sabu on August 4, and a scheduled return match on August 18 was canceled after Sabu legitimately suffered a serious back injury.

While injured, Brunk contracted a virus and was hospitalized, sidelining him for ten months. On December 12, a benefit show, &quot;A Night of Appreciation for Sabu&quot;, was held by the AWWL to raise funds for him. The show was considered a success, raising enough money for Brunk to cover the costs of his medical care and he was able to make a full recovery. In his first match back from the injury in the AWWL/BTW, he defeated N8 Mattson. Sabu then appeared at &quot;Hardcore Homecoming&quot;, where he defeated Terry Funk and Shane Douglas in a three-way no-ropes barbed wire match, and at ECW One Night Stand two days later, where he defeated Rhyno.

====Recovery and departure (2005–2006)====
Sabu returned to TNA on July 29, 2005. At Sacrifice Sabu teamed with his old enemy, and then NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Raven to face Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. Rhino and Jarrett won the match after Rhino gored Raven through a table and pinned him. The match saw Abyss interfering and attacking Sabu, starting a feud between the two of them. They went on to have a match at Unbreakable in September which Abyss won after performing his &quot;Black Hole Slam&quot; finisher on to a pile of tacks in the ring. Sabu once again found himself squaring off against Rhino and Abyss, as well as Jeff Hardy, during Bound for Glory in the Monster&#x27;s Ball 2 match. Rhino won the match. On the same night, Sabu competed in a ten-man Gauntlet Match to decide a number one contender, which he also lost, once again to Rhino.

Sabu continued his feud with Abyss, once again losing to him at Genesis after taking a Black Hole Slam onto a barbed wire steel chair. They met up again, in the promotion&#x27;s first ever Barbed Wire Massacre at Turning Point. Sabu finally beat Abyss, but following the match was not seen on TNA television for several months. He made his return at Lockdown on April 23, 2006, in a match against Samoa Joe for Joe&#x27;s TNA X Division Championship, despite Sabu having a broken forearm, a match he lost. Sabu was released soon afterwards from TNA.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2006–2007)===

Shortly after his TNA release, on April 24, 2006, Sabu&#x27;s official website reported that he had signed a one-year contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. At the ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view, Sabu faced Rey Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship. At the end of the match, Mysterio found himself standing on a ringside table with Sabu flying at him. Sabu caught the champ in a front facelock and nailed him with a DDT which caused both men to crash through the table. At this point, the WWE medical staff rushed to the injured men and declared neither man could continue and ordered the match stopped, resulting in a No Contest in which Mysterio kept his title.

On the June 13 premiere of &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, Sabu won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal with the stipulation that the winner face John Cena at Vengeance. Sabu further fueled the feud during the next week&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot;, when he interfered in a Cena match and performed a &quot;Triple Jump Leg Drop&quot; on him, diving onto Cena and putting him through the announcers&#x27; table. Cena defeated Sabu in their &quot;Extreme Lumberjack match&quot; at Vengeance. On July 2, Sabu, traveling with fellow ECW wrestler Rob Van Dam, was arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, and nine Vicodin tablets following a traffic stop in Hanging Rock, Ohio following a house show in Huntington, West Virginia. Brunk was fined $1,000 based on the guidelines of WWE&#x27;s Wellness Policy. He pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance and the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia was dropped. He was given a suspended sentence of 10 days in jail and a $500 fine. Meanwhile, he defeated Stevie Richards in an Extreme Rules match at &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXIII&quot;.
Towards the end of July, Sabu began to talk on camera for himself – instead of using a go between – and demanded a shot at Big Show&#x27;s ECW World Championship which Paul Heyman refused to grant him in order to &quot;protect&quot; his champion. Instead, he forced him into a match against the returning Kurt Angle to determine a number one contender. When that match was interrupted by the returning Rob Van Dam another match was signed, Angle versus Van Dam versus Sabu, for the number one contendership (Angle then became too injured to compete and was pulled from the match). Sabu beat Rob Van Dam in their ladder match to win a shot at Big Show at SummerSlam, a match which he ended up losing.

At Survivor Series, Sabu teamed up with John Cena, Bobby Lashley, Rob Van Dam and Kane to face the team of Big Show, Test, Montel Vontavious Porter, Finlay and Umaga. Sabu eliminated Test following a Tornado DDT, but he was later eliminated by Big Show via pinfall after receiving a chokeslam. In the end, Team Cena gained victory. At December to Dismember, Sabu was originally set to appear in the main event, an Extreme Elimination Chamber match for the ECW World Championship against Big Show, Test, Rob Van Dam, CM Punk and Bobby Lashley, but was &quot;taken out&quot; and replaced by Hardcore Holly. The following episode on &quot;ECW&quot;, CM Punk and Rob Van Dam got on the mic before their match with Test and Hardcore Holly and dedicated the match to Sabu. When Punk and Van Dam won the match, Paul Heyman and his security team came out and had beaten down on the two. Sabu later made his return with a heavily wrapped arm to make the save. Sabu made his Royal Rumble match debut in the 2007 Royal Rumble on January 28, where he was eliminated by Kane after receiving a chokeslam over the top rope and through a table.

Sabu joined the ECW Originals along with Rob Van Dam, Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman. The ECW Originals began a feud with the New Breed (Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, Marcus Cor Von and Matt Striker). The two teams faced off in a match at WrestleMania 23 in which the ECW Originals won. On the April 3 edition of &quot;ECW&quot;, the ECW Originals faced the New Breed again in a rematch, which the New Breed won after Burke performed the Elijah Express on Sabu through a table.

Sabu&#x27;s final WWE match was on the May 1 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, where he competed in a fatal four-way match against Dreamer, Van Dam and Sandman to determine the number one contender for the ECW World Championship, which Van Dam won. On May 16, 2007, Sabu was released from his WWE contract.

===Independent circuit (2007–2010)===
On July 13, 2007, it was announced that Sabu would be working in Mexico&#x27;s AAA promotion in Mexico for their Triplemanía XV event. Sabu came out during the main event and put La Parka through a table, joining forces with the heels X-Pack, Ron &quot;The Truth&quot; Killings, and Konnan. Since then, he has made appearances on their major televised programs on Galavision as a minor part of Konnan&#x27;s heel stable, La Legión Extranjera. On October 30, 2010, Sabu defeated Damián 666 to win Xtreme Latin American Wrestling&#x27;s International Championship.

===Juggalo Championship Wrestling (2007–2011)===
In 2007, Sabu teamed with Insane Clown Posse to defeat Trent Acid and the Young Alter Boys at Juggalo Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Bloodymania. During the second season of the company&#x27;s internet wrestling show SlamTV!, Raven was involved in a feud with JCW Heavyweight Champion Corporal Robinson. In the third episode, Sabu appeared from out of the crowd and saved Robinson from an attack by Raven and his lackey Sexy Slim Goody. Raven and Goody teamed up against Robinson and Sabu in the following episode, but Raven fled from the match. At Bloodymania III, Sabu defeated Raven in a Raven&#x27;s Rules match. He returned as a full-time member of the roster at Oddball Wrestling 2010, where he defeated Officer Colt Cabana in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match. Following two victories, Sabu teamed with The Weedman to defeat Bull Pain and Isabella Smothers at Hardcore Hell. After the match, per narrative thread, he aligned himself with villainous manager Charlie Brown. Sabu defeated heroic face 2 Tuff Tony at the next event, and continued to attack him after the match ended. He and Tony wrestled again at Up in Smoke in a match where Rob Conway was hired by Brown to attack Tony. After Rhino scared off Sabu and Conway, a tag team match was scheduled between the two and Rhino and Tony at St. Andrew&#x27;s Brawl.

===Return to TNA (2010)===
On August 2, 2010, it was confirmed that Sabu would be taking part in TNA&#x27;s ECW reunion show against TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam in the main event Hardcore Justice on August 8. At the event, he was defeated by former tag team partner and rival Rob Van Dam in a Hardcore Rules match. On the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni, known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they didn&#x27;t deserve to be in TNA. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter gave each member of EV 2.0 TNA contracts in order for them to settle their score with . At No Surrender, Sabu unsuccessfully challenged Douglas Williams for the TNA X Division Championship. At Bound for Glory, Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Rhino and Stevie Richards defeated Fortune members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match. On the October 21 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Sabu and Rob Van Dam were defeated in a tag team match by James Storm and Robert Roode, after Sabu accidentally hit his own partner with a chair. After the match, Van Dam and Sabu began shoving each other, before being broken up by the rest of EV 2.0. At Turning Point, EV 2.0 faced Fortune in a ten-man tag team match, where each member of EV 2.0 put their TNA careers on the line. A.J. Styles won the match for his team by pinning Sabu, who as a result was fired from TNA. It had been reported earlier that Brunk&#x27;s release from TNA was legitimate.

===Return to independent circuit (2012–2021)===

On January 14, 2012, Sabu returned to the former ECW Arena, when he defeated Justin Credible at an Evolve event in the venue&#x27;s final professional wrestling event. In 2013, Sabu completed a UK tour, wrestling for a number of the UK&#x27;s top promotions. Sabu entered the Extreme Rising World Championship tournament but was eliminated in the first round by Devon Storm.

On March 30, 2013, Sabu made his Newfoundland wrestling debut when he wrestled in the Newfoundland and Labrador based company&#x27;s CEW &quot;King Of The Rock&quot; tournament. This was a two-show event which saw Sabu defeat multiple CEW mainstays such as CEW headliners Psycho Mitch and Krys Krysmon. Sabu ultimately lost the tournament after a brutal match with Scott Gotch in which Sabu lost intentionally at the request of CEW owner Dennis Guthrie. As a reward, CEW owner enshrined Sabu as the new CEW Newfoundland Heritage Champion. He defended his title in a Fatal Four-Way elimination match on April 1, 2013, for CEW in St. Lawrence, NL against Justin Lock, Tony King and Brandon Flip. In Scotland, Sabu challenged Jack Jester for the ICW Heavyweight Championship but was defeated. Sabu returned to ICW in 2015 to continue his feud with Jester and challenge the ICW World Heavyweight Champion Drew Galloway but was again defeated.

Sabu has also worked for Pro Wrestling Holland, where he has held the PWH Championship. On October 18, 2014, at Insurrection, Sabu defeated Balls Mahoney to win the WWL Extreme Championship. He lost the title against Monster Pain. He has also wrestled for the Big Time Wrestling independent circuit.

On November 15, 2014, Melissa Coates began accompanying Sabu to the ring as the &quot;Super Genie&quot;. Their partnership continued until her death on June 23, 2021.

On June 5, 2015, Sabu lost a match to his long-time partner Rob Van Dam in Scranton, Pennsylvania. At the end of the match, after pinning Sabu, RVD helped him up off the mat and both raised hands together.

On August 17, 2018, Sabu lost to Nick Gage at a GCW event.

===Second return to Impact Wrestling (2019)===
On February 8, 2019, it was revealed that Sabu would return to TNA, now named Impact Wrestling at their following pay-per-view, United We Stand. At the event on April 4, 2019, Sabu teamed with Rob Van Dam to face Lucha Bros (Pentagón Jr. and Fénix). Sabu wrestled some of the following television tapings, but disappeared after a while. In September it was reported that Impact was going to bring him back for more dates in the future. Just days later, Sabu wrestled Rohit Raju at the Impact television tapings in Las Vegas, in a match that went to a double countout. At Bound for Glory, Sabu competed in the Call Your Shot Gauntlet match which was won by Eddie Edwards.

===Retirement (2021)===
On November 5, 2021, Sabu officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling.

===All Elite Wrestling (2023)===
On May 24, 2023, Sabu made his debut for All Elite Wrestling on Dynamite when it was revealed that he would come out of retirement for a one-off in the corner of Adam Cole along with Roderick Strong during his unsanctioned match with Chris Jericho at the Double or Nothing pay-per-view.

==Other media==
He appeared in the video game &quot;ECW Hardcore Revolution&quot;, &quot;Legends of Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Legends of Wrestling II&quot;, &quot;Backyard Wrestling: Don&#x27;t Try This At Home&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;. Sabu&#x27;s likeness also appears, albeit unofficially, in several games within the Fire Pro Wrestling franchise including &quot;Fire Pro Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Fire Pro Wrestling 2&quot;, and &quot;Fire Pro Wrestling Returns&quot;.

On September 8, 2016, Brunk guest starred on an episode of the Viceland television program, &quot;Traveling the Stars: Action Bronson and Friends Watch &#x27;Ancient Aliens&#x27;: Alien Devastation&quot; with his former tag team partner, Rob Van Dam and then manager The Super Genie.

==Personal life==
Brunk&#x27;s father is of Irish and German descent, while his mother is Lebanese. He was married to a Japanese woman named Hitomi, on June 22, 1997, in Michigan, and had a separate Japanese ceremony on December 12, 1998, in Tokyo while in Japan for the ECW/FMW Supershow. They have since separated and divorced at an unknown date. In &quot;Forever Hardcore&quot;, Brunk reveals he took his name &quot;Sabu&quot; from Indian-American actor Sabu, of whom his uncle Ed Farhat was a fan.

In July 2016, Brunk was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred &quot;long term neurological injuries&quot; and that the company &quot;routinely failed to care&quot; for them and &quot;fraudulently misrepresented and concealed&quot; the nature and extent of those injuries. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.

In the mid-2010s, Brunk began dating Melissa Coates, who also began working as his wrestling valet until her death on June 23, 2021, due to COVID-19 complications. She died in her sleep, aged 52.

==Professional wrestling style and persona==

Sabu is nicknamed &quot;The Suicidal, Homicidal, Genocidal, Death–Defying Maniac&quot; due to his mixed style of high-flying and hardcore wrestling. Some of his moves includes using a steel chair, like the &quot;Air Sabu&quot; (a heel kick to a cornered opponent, with the assistance of a steel chair), the &quot;Arabian Facebuster&quot; (Jumping, diving or a somersault leg drop, driving a steel chair into the face of the opponent) or the &quot;Arabian Skullcrusher&quot; (jumping, diving or a somersault leg drop, driving a steel chair into the back of the opponent&#x27;s head, usually through a table). Being trained by his uncle, The Original Sheik, he also uses his &quot;Arabian Clutch&quot; (a Camel clutch) as a move. His character has rarely spoken, however while working for WWE he had to do the most talking he ever did.

Sabu has been credited as a revolutionary due to his work in ECW.

<doc id="852994" wikidata="Q831027" url="?curid=852994" title="List of liberal theorists">
<text>Individual contributors to classical liberalism and political liberalism are associated with philosophers of the Enlightenment. Liberalism as a specifically named ideology begins in the late 18th century as a movement towards self-government and away from aristocracy. It included the ideas of self-determination, the primacy of the individual and the nation as opposed to the state and religion as being the fundamental units of law, politics and economy.

Since then liberalism broadened to include a wide range of approaches from Americans Ronald Dworkin, Richard Rorty, John Rawls and Francis Fukuyama as well as the Indian Amartya Sen and the Peruvian Hernando de Soto. Some of these people moved away from liberalism while others espoused other ideologies before turning to liberalism. There are many different views of what constitutes liberalism, and some liberals would feel that some of the people on this list were not true liberals. It is intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive. Theorists whose ideas were mainly typical for one country should be listed in that country&#x27;s section of liberalism worldwide. Generally only thinkers are listed whereas politicians are only listed when they also made substantial contributions to liberal theory beside their active political work.

==Classical contributors to liberalism==

===Aristotle===
Aristotle (Athens, 384–322 BC) is revered among political theorists for his seminal work &quot;Politics&quot;. He made invaluable contributions to liberal theory through his observations on different forms of government and the nature of man.

He begins with the idea that the best government provides an active and &quot;happy&quot; life for its people. Aristotle then considers six forms of government: Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Polity on one side as &#x27;good&#x27; forms of government, and Tyranny, Oligarchy, and Democracy as &#x27;bad&#x27; forms. Considering each in turn, Aristotle rejects Monarchy as infantilizing of citizens, Oligarchy as too profit-motivated, Tyranny as against the will of the people, Democracy as serving only to the poor, and Aristocracy (known today as Meritocracy) as ideal but ultimately impossible. Aristotle finally concludes that a polity—a combination between democracy and oligarchy, where most can vote but must choose among the rich and virtuous for governors—is the best compromise between idealism and realism.

In addition, Aristotle was a firm supporter of private property. He refuted Plato&#x27;s argument for a collectivist society in which family and property are held in common: Aristotle makes the argument that when one&#x27;s own son or land is rightfully one&#x27;s own, one puts much more effort into cultivating that item, to the ultimate betterment of society. He references barbarian tribes of his time in which property was held in common, and the laziest of the bunch would always take away large amounts of food grown by the most diligent.

===Cicero===
His Stoic, Cato, advocated for Greek Stoicism in Cicero&#x27;s books. It&#x27;s a development of Aristotle&#x27;s ethics and goes further, advocating equal rights for all people. It was found to be scientifically true on inspection in the &#x27;90s, by Becker (1998). He was also a major influence to John Locke.

=== Laozi ===

Laozi was a Chinese philosopher and writer, considered the founder of Taoism. Arguing that Laozi is a libertarian, James A. Dorn wrote that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, &quot;argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony.&quot;

== Liberal thinkers of the Muslim Golden Age ==

The Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th century) was marked by a flourishing of intellectual activity in the Islamic world. Several scholars and thinkers from this era contributed to ideas that align with certain liberal principles, emphasizing reason, justice, and individual rights.

=== Al-Farabi (872–950) ===

Al-Farabi, known as &quot;the Second Teacher,&quot; was a philosopher influential in transmitting Greek philosophy to the Islamic world. His political philosophy, seen in works like The Virtuous City, stressed the importance of justice and the common good in governance, influencing both Muslim and European thought.

=== Averroes (1126–1198) ===

Ibn Rushd, a Spanish-Arab philosopher, advocated for the compatibility of reason and philosophy with Islamic faith. His commentaries on Aristotle and independent works promoted the separation of reason and revelation, profoundly influencing both Islamic and Western thought.

=== Avicenna (980–1037) ===

Ibn Sina, a polymath known for contributions to medicine and metaphysics, delved into political philosophy. In *The Book of Healing*, he discussed the need for a well-ordered state, emphasizing the role of a philosopher-king guided by reason and wisdom.

=== Ibn Tufayl (1105–1185) ===

Ibn Tufail, a philosopher and physician, explored individualism and reason in Hayy ibn Yaqdhan. The novel discussed a person raised in isolation, emphasizing themes of individual pursuit of knowledge.

==From Machiavelli to Spinoza==
===Niccolò Machiavelli===

Niccolò Machiavelli (Florence, 1469–1527), best known for his &quot;Il Principe&quot; was the founder of realist political philosophy, advocated republican government, citizen armies, protection of personal property, and restraint of government expenditure as being necessary to the liberties of a republic. He wrote extensively on the need for individual initiative—&quot;virtu&quot;—as an essential characteristic of stable government. He argued that liberty was the central good which government should protect, and that &quot;good people&quot; would make good laws, whereas people who had lost their virtue could maintain their liberties only with difficulty. His Discourses on Livy outlined realism as the central idea of political study and favored &quot;Republics&quot; over &quot;Principalities&quot;.

Machiavelli differed from true liberal thinking however, in that he still noted the benefits of princely governance. He states that republican leaders need to &quot;act alone&quot; if they want to reform a republic, and offers the example of Romulus, who killed his brother and co-ruler to found a great city. Republics need to refer to arbitrary and violent measures if it is necessary to maintain the structure of the government, as Machiavelli says that they have to ignore thoughts of justice and fairness.

Anti-statist liberals consider Machiavelli&#x27;s distrust as his main message, noting his call for a strong state under a strong leader, who should use any means to establish his position, whereas liberalism is an ideology of individual freedom and voluntary choices.

===Erasmus===

Desiderius Erasmus (Netherlands, 1466–1536) was an advocate of humanism, critic of entrenched interests, irrationality and superstition. Erasmusian societies formed across Europe, to some extent in response to the turbulence of the Reformation.
In his &quot;De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio&quot; (1524), he analyzes the Lutheran exaggeration of the obvious limitations on human freedom.

=== Étienne de La Boétie ===

Étienne de La Boétie (France, 1530–1563) was a French writer, magistrate and political theorist. According to Etienne the chief question of political philosophy was the question of how people come to accept the will of tyrants.

===Thomas Hobbes===

Thomas Hobbes (England, 1588–1679) theorized that government is the result of individual actions and human traits, and that it was motivated primarily by &quot;interest&quot;, a term which would become crucial in the development of a liberal theory of government and political economy, since it is the foundation of the idea that individuals can be self-governing and self-regulating. His work &quot;Leviathan&quot;, did not advocate this viewpoint, but instead that only a strong government could restrain unchecked interest: it did, however, advance a proto-liberal position in arguing for an inalienable &quot;right of nature,&quot; the right to defend oneself, even against the state. Though his own ideological position is open to debate, his work influenced Spinoza, Locke, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and many other liberals.
* Contributing literature: 
** &quot;Leviathan&quot;, 1651 (Theologico-Political Treatise)

===Spinoza===

Baruch Spinoza (Netherlands, 1632–1677) in his &quot;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus&quot; &quot;(TTP)&quot; (1670) and &quot;Tractatus Politicus&quot; (1678) defends the importance of separation of church and state as well as forms of democracy. In the &quot;TTP&quot;, Spinoza articulates a strong critique of religious intolerance and a defense of secular government against the power of religious authorities. Spinoza laid the philosophical groundwork for the emancipation of Jews, putting them on an equal footing as other citizens.

** &quot;Tractatus Politicus&quot;, 1677 (Political Treatise)

==From Locke to Tocqueville==

===John Locke===

John Locke&#x27;s (England, 1632–1704) notion that a &quot;government with the consent of the governed&quot; and man&#x27;s natural rights—life, liberty, and estate (property) as well on tolerance, as laid down in &quot;A letter concerning toleration&quot; and &quot;Two treatises of government&quot;—had an enormous influence on the development of liberalism. Locke developed a theory of property resting on the actions of individuals, rather than on descent or nobility.

** &quot;A Letter Concerning Toleration&quot;, 1689
** &quot;The Second Treatise of Civil Government&quot;, 1689

===John Trenchard===
John Trenchard (United Kingdom, 1662–1723) was co-author, with Thomas Gordon of &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot;. These newspaper essays condemned tyranny and advanced principles of freedom of conscience and freedom of speech and were a main vehicle for spreading the concepts that had been developed by John Locke.

** &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot; / John Trenchard &amp; Thomas Gordon, 1720–1723

===Charles de Montesquieu===

Charles de Montesquieu (France, 1689–1755)
In &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot;, Montesquieu expounded the separation of powers in government and society. In government, Montesquieu encouraged division into the now standard legislative, judicial and executive branches; in society, he perceived a natural organization into king, the people and the aristocracy, with the latter playing a mediating role. &quot;I do not write to censor that which is established in any country whatsoever,&quot; Montesquieu disclaimed in the &quot;Laws&quot;; however, he did pay special attention to what he felt was the positive example of the constitutional system in England, which in spite of its evolution toward a fusion of powers, had moderated the power of the monarch, and divided Parliament along class lines.

Montesquieu&#x27;s work had a seminal impact on the American and French revolutionaries. Ironically, the least liberal element of his thought—his privileging of the aristocracy—was belied by both revolutions. Montesquieu&#x27;s system came to fruition in America, a country with no aristocracy; in France, political maneuvering by the aristocracy led to the convocation of the 1789 Estates-General and popular revolt.

===Adam Smith===

Adam Smith (Great Britain, 1723–1790), often considered the founder of modern economics, was a key figure in formulating and advancing economic doctrine of free trade and competition. In his &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; Adam Smith outlined the key idea that if the economy is basically left to its own devices, limited and finite resources will be put to ultimately their most efficient use through people acting purely in their self-interest. This concept has been quoted out of context by later economists as the invisible hand of the market.

Smith also advanced property rights and personal civil liberties, including stopping slavery, which today partly form the basic liberal ideology. He was also opposed to stock-holding companies, what today is called a &quot;corporation&quot;, because he predicated the self-policing of the free market upon the free association of moral individuals.

===John Stuart Mill===

John Stuart Mill (United Kingdom, 1806–1873) is one of the first champions of modern &quot;liberalism.&quot; As such, his work on political economy and logic helped lay the foundation for advancements in empirical science and public policy based on verifiable improvements. Strongly influenced by Bentham&#x27;s utilitarianism, he disagrees with Kant&#x27;s intuitive notion of right and formulates the &quot;highest normative principle&quot; of morals as:
&quot;Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.&quot;

Some consider Mill as the founder of Social liberalism. Although Mill was mainly for free markets, he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds. Mill was also a champion of women&#x27;s rights.

Şinasi used his newspapers, &quot;Tercüman-ı Ahvâl&quot; and &quot;Tasvîr-i Efkâr&quot;, to promote the proliferation of European Enlightenment ideals during the Tanzimat period, and he made the education of the literate Ottoman public his personal vocation. Though many of Şinasi&#x27;s projects were incomplete at the time of his death, &quot;he was at the forefront of a number of fields and put his stamp on the development of each field so long as it contained unsolved problems.&quot; Şinasi, influenced by Enlightenment thought, saw freedom of expression as a fundamental right and used journalism in order to engage, communicate with, and educate the public. By speaking directly to the public about government affairs, Şinasi declared that state actions were not solely the interest of the government.

Positive conceptions assumed that liberty could only be achieved when collective power (in the form of church or state) acted to &#x27;liberate&#x27; mankind from its worst aspects. These, Berlin felt, tended towards totalitarianism. Negative conceptions, by contrast, argued that liberty was achieved when individuals were given maximal freedom from external constraints (so long as these did not infringe on the freedom of others to achieve the same condition). Berlin was also a critic of dogmatic Enlightenment rationalism on the grounds that it was unable to accommodate value pluralism.

He argues for equal basic liberties, equality of opportunity, and facilitating the maximum benefit to the least advantaged members of society in any case where inequalities may occur. Rawls&#x27;s argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the &quot;original position&quot;, in which people deliberately select what kind of society they would choose to live in if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy.

===Bryan Magee===
The British philosopher, broadcaster, and politician Bryan Magee (1930-2019) wrote some books of political philosophy. Although he was a member of the Labour Party and then the Social Democrats, he wrote in his autobiography that he considered himself a liberal. He saw his book &quot;The New Radicalism&quot; as an attempt to convert the Labour Party to a tradition of radical liberalism, in which he included Karl Popper. He later followed this with &quot;The Democratic Revolution&quot;, which was very critical of Communism in Eastern Europe.

===Richard Rorty===
Richard Rorty (United States, 1931–2007) was one of the leading contemporary philosophers of liberalism. His fundamental claims, among others, are that liberalism is best defined as the attempt to avoid cruelty to others; that liberals need to accept the historical &#x27;irony&#x27; that there is no metaphysical justification for their belief that not being cruel is a virtue; that literature plays a crucial role in developing the empathy necessary to promote solidarity (and therefore lack of cruelty) between humans; and that private philosophising and public political discourse are separate practices and should remain so.

===Amartya Sen===

Amartya Sen (India, 1933– ) is an economist whose early work was based on Kenneth Arrow&#x27;s General Possibility Theorem, and on the impossibility of both complete pareto optimality and solely procedural based rights.

===Robert Nozick===
Robert Nozick (United States, 1938–2002) was a libertarian (or minarchist). He advocated an unapologetically reductionist political philosophy characterized by meticulous analysis of the moral aspects of each social interaction, and did not shy away from addressing hard philosophical issues such as the original appropriation of property. Nozick is best known for providing the justification of a minimal state by showing that it can be established without any unjust steps.
* Some literature:
** &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;, 1974

===Hernando de Soto===
The economist Hernando de Soto (Peru, 1941– ) is an advocate of transparency and private property rights, arguing that intransparent government leads to property not being given proper title, and therefore being &quot;dead capital&quot; which cannot be used as the basis of credit. Argues that laws which allocate property to those most able to use them for economic growth, so called &quot;squatter&#x27;s rights&quot;, are an important innovation.
* Some literature:
** &quot;The Other Path&quot;, 1986.
** &quot;The Mystery of Capital&quot;, 2000.

===Michael Meadowcroft===
A biography described the British politician Michael Meadowcroft as &quot;the main, indeed very nearly the only, philosopher of applied Liberalism within the old Liberal Party from the late 1960s onwards&quot;. On the merger of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party in the UK to form the Liberal Democrats, Meadowcroft initially reconstituted a new Liberal Party with others who did not want to compromise the philosophy of liberalism. However, the new Liberal Party became increasingly Eurosceptic under the leadership of Steve Radford and Meadowcroft joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007. He has regularly argued for the importance of political philosophy and that members of the Liberal Democrats require more conviction in their beliefs.

===Will Kymlicka===
Will Kymlicka (Canada, 1962– ) tries in his philosophy to determine if forms of ethnic or minority nationalism are compatible with liberal-democratic principles of individual freedom, social equality and political democracy. In his book &quot;Multicultural Citizenship. A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights&quot; he argues that certain &quot;group-differentiated rights&quot; of minority cultures can be consistent with these liberal-democratic principles.

<doc id="852996" wikidata="Q291804" url="?curid=852996" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver">
<text>The de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver is a single-engined high-wing propeller-driven short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft developed and manufactured by de Havilland Canada. It has been primarily operated as a bush plane and has been used for a wide variety of utility roles, such as cargo and passenger hauling, aerial application (crop dusting and aerial topdressing), and civil aviation duties.

Shortly after the end of the Second World War, de Havilland Canada decided to orient itself towards civilian operators. Based on feedback from pilots, the company decided that the envisioned aircraft should have excellent STOL performance, all-metal construction, and accommodate many features sought by the operators of bush planes. On 16 August 1947, the maiden flight of the aircraft, which had received the designation &quot;DHC-2 Beaver&quot;, took place. In April 1948, the first production aircraft was delivered to the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests. A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Beaver played a supporting role in Sir Edmund Hillary&#x27;s famous 1958 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition to the South Pole.

In addition to its use in civilian operations, the Beaver has been widely adopted by armed forces as a utility aircraft. The United States Army purchased several hundred aircraft; nine DHC-2s are still in service with the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary (Civil Air Patrol) for search and rescue. By 1967, over 1,600 Beavers had been constructed prior to the closure of the original assembly line. Various aircraft have been remanufactured and upgraded. Additionally, various proposals have been made to return the Beaver to production.

The Beaver&#x27;s versatility and performance led to it being the preferred aircraft of bush pilots servicing remote locations in the Canadian north, and it is considered by aviation historians to be a Canadian icon. In 1987, the Canadian &quot;Engineering Centennial Board&quot; named the DHC-2 one of the top ten Canadian engineering achievements of the 20th century. The Royal Canadian Mint honoured the aircraft on a special edition Canadian quarter in November 1999, and on a 50-cent commemorative gold coin in 2008. Large numbers continue to be operational into the 21st century, while the tooling and type certificate for the Beaver have been acquired by Viking Air who continue to produce replacement components and refurbish examples of the type.

==Development==
===Origins===


Following the end of the Second World War, de Havilland Canada&#x27;s management team, recognising that there would be a corresponding downturn in military orders in the immediate post-war climate, decided to focus the company&#x27;s energies upon finding work within the civilian sector. The company had recently hired Punch Dickins as Director of Sales; Dickins carried out an extensive market research program in the form of requesting and collecting feedback from other pilots, to understand what they needed in a new aircraft. It was on the basis of this information from the prospective operators themselves, as opposed to aerodynamic research or fiscal data, that the future aircraft has its origins.

In response, almost without exception, these pilots specified their desire for tremendous extra power and STOL performance, in a design that could be easily fitted with wheels, skis or floats. When de Havilland engineers noted this would result in poor cruise performance, one pilot replied, &quot;You only have to be faster than a dog sled to be a winner&quot;. Other suggestions that were seemingly mundane, but important in the bush plane world, included the installation of full-sized doors on both sides of the aircraft, which meant that it could be readily loaded no matter which side of a dock it tied up on; the doors were also made wide enough to allow for a 44 Imperial gallon drum to be rolled up into the aircraft.

On 17 September 1946, de Havilland officially put together a design team consisting of Fred Buller, Dick Hiscocks, Jim Houston and Wsiewołod Jakimiuk, led by Phil Garratt. The new aircraft was designed to be all-metal (unlike older designs, like the famous Noorduyn Norseman), using &quot;steel from the engine to the firewall, heavy aluminium truss frames with panels and doors throughout the front seat area, lighter trusses toward the rear and all monocoque construction aft&quot;. At the time, de Havilland Canada was still a British-owned company and there were plans to fit the evolving design with the British de Havilland Gipsy engine. As a result of its comparatively limited power, the wing area was greatly increased in order to maintain STOL performance. When Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada offered to supply war-surplus Wasp Junior radial engines at a low price, the aircraft ended up with extra power as well as the original long wing. The result was unbeatable STOL performance for an aircraft of its size.

In line with the convention for aircraft produced by de Havilland Canada being named after animals, it was decided that the new bush plane would be named after the beaver, which was known for its hard-working nature. On 16 August 1947, the maiden flight of the DHC-2 Beaver was in Downsview, Ontario; it was flown by Second World War flying ace Russell Bannock. After completing its flight test programme, the prototype received several adjustments and improvements in order for it to serve as a flying demonstration model ready for the sales circuit. The prototype was ultimately sold to Central British Columbia Airways, as a routine day-to-day working air-taxi airplane and continued to fly as such with various air-taxi operators until 1980, after which it was retired and preserved. In April 1948, the first production aircraft was delivered to the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests, who had been a design partner.

===Production===
Initial sales were slow, perhaps two or three a month but as the plane was demonstrated sales started to improve. A key event in the Beaver&#x27;s history occurred the next year when the US Army commenced its search for a new utility aircraft to replace their fleet of Cessnas. The competition quickly boiled down to the Beaver and the Cessna 195. The Beaver won and during the Korean War, the US Army ordered 970, more than half of the overall production run for the type.

Soon, the Beaver grew to become an export success as orders for the type increased from customers around the world. Individual military services of more than 30 different nations would ultimately be included amongst its operators. In later life, as the type was gradually phased out of military service, many examples underwent conversion work so that they could continue to be operated as civilian aircraft instead. During the 1960s, de Havilland developed an improved model of the Beaver, the Mk.III Turbo Beaver, which was equipped with a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6 turboprop engine. A total of sixty aircraft were built during the late 1960s. In 1967, when production of the type finally ceased, a total of 1,657 DHC-2 Beavers had been constructed.

The Beaver was designed for flight in rugged and remote areas of the world. Its STOL capability made it ideal for areas normally only accessible by canoe or foot. Because the aircraft often flies to remote locations and in cold climates, its oil reservoir filler is located in the cockpit and oil can be filled in flight. A series of upgrades to the basic design were incorporated. One major customer introduced the use of flat steps replacing the earlier tubes, a feature now almost universal. In 1987, the Canadian &quot;Engineering Centennial Board&quot; named the DHC-2 as one of the top ten Canadian engineering achievements of the 20th century.

===1995 to 2024 ===

At one point in its production, plans to license-build the Beaver in New Zealand were proposed. The remaining tooling was purchased by Viking Air of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, which manufactures replacement parts for most of the early de Havilland line. The company markets and sells the remanufactured DHC-2T Turbo Beaver, an improved variant of the aircraft which has been upgraded with a PT6A-34, which enables an increased maximum gross takeoff weight of and the carriage of up to of freight, a roughly 25 per cent increase in usable payload. By August 1995, Viking completed its 30th Turbo Beaver conversion. The firm has also developed and marketed other improvements for the type, such as an advanced wing and modified floats. Other manufacturers have also offered aftermarket upgrades and modifications for the type, such as re-engining programmes by Orenda Aerospace and Wipaire.

On 24 February 2006, Viking purchased the type certificates from Bombardier Aerospace for all the original de Havilland designs, including the Beaver. The ownership of the certificates gives the company the exclusive right to manufacture new aircraft. Viking has stated its interest in the potential restart of production of the Beaver, and commented that, dependent upon market demand, the firm may offer two separate models of the Beaver, one intended to be close to the design of the original batch, and another incorporating various improvements such as new avionics, engines, and doors, as well as likely being stretched to provide increased internal space.

Stolairus Aviation of Kelowna, British Columbia has developed several modifications for the DHC-2 including a STOL Kit which modifies the wing with a contoured leading edge, flap-gap seals, wing fences and drooped wingtips for increased performance. Stolairus has also developed a Wing Angle Kit which changes the incidence of the wing.

Advanced Wing Technologies of Vancouver, British Columbia has developed and certified a new wing for the DHC-2. The FAA Supplemental Type Certificate also raises the aircraft&#x27;s gross weight to . So far, at least two Beavers have been modified in such a manner.

In September 2017 the Transportation Safety Board of Canada recommended stall warning devices be mandated for commercial Beaver operators.

In March 2019, Harbour Air announced plans to convert a DHC-2 Beaver to an electric aircraft for development and prototype testing, with aspirational plans to eventually to convert its entire fleet. The first test flight of the aircraft took place in Vancouver in December 2019. By 2024, Harbor Air is anticipating the MagniX motor/battery set being airworthiness certified by Transport Canada by the end of 2026, with a plan to get the eBeaver type-certified by the end of 2027 and able to enter commercial service.

==Design==
The de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver is a single-engined high-wing propeller-driven STOL aircraft, principally operated as a bush plane and other utility roles, such as cargo and passenger hauling, aerial application (crop dusting and aerial topdressing), and general civil aviation purposes; aviation publication Plane &amp; Pilot described the type as being &quot;arguably the best bush plane ever built&quot;. The Beaver was designed to operate in all seasons and the majority of weather conditions; a large proportion were also equipped with floats for buoyancy in water; it reportedly possesses favourable performance characteristics for a floatplane. As a result of its favourable characteristics as a hard working and productive aircraft, the Beaver has had a lengthy service life and many examples have been remanufactured or have otherwise received life extension modifications.

The Beaver is typically powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior radial engine. In order to provide the necessary weight balance for optimal loading flexibility, the engine was mounted as far rearwards as possible, resulting in elements intruding into the cockpit space, such as the oil tank being positioned within the center console between the pilot and copilot&#x27;s feet and the main fuel tank within the forward belly of the aircraft, which also improves accessibility for replenishment. Many Beavers have had wingtip tanks also installed; careful fuel management between the various fuel tanks is required throughout flights in order to maintain the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity. The remanufactured DHC-2T Turbo Beaver is equipped with a PT6A-34 turboprop engine.

The Beaver is functionally shaped in order to accommodate a useful and sizable payload, typically close to , even when equipped with floats. While the front doors are narrow, the aft doors are wider, having been designed to facilitate the loading of 45 imperial gallon barrels, either upright or on their sides. The Beaver is considered a &#x27;working&#x27; aircraft, which was designed for vigorous use. In addition to cargo, passengers can also be carried; when appropriately fitted out, the Beaver Mk.I can accommodate up to seven passengers while the more spacious Beaver Mk.III can hold a maximum of 11. Various alterations have been approved, including alternative seating arrangements, enlarged cargo doors, larger windows and smaller batteries have been approved for use.

During takeoff, both the ailerons and flaps are lowered, which is a relatively uncommon design approach but results in substantially elevated STOL performance. The flaps can be deployed to an extreme range, extending out at full to a 58-degree position; the flight manual notes that the full setting is recommended only for performing emergency landings. In the skies, the Beaver is relatively easy to handle, having been described as possessing light and comfortable controls. Effective application of the rudder is necessary to counteract adverse yaw. It should be flown with a relatively nose-low pitch attitude to maintain airspeed. It is very easy to land, even in moderately rough water.

==Operational history==

Despite the fact that production ceased in 1967, hundreds of Beavers are still flying—many of them heavily modified to adapt to changes in technology and needs. Kenmore Air of Kenmore, Washington, provides Beaver and Otter airframes with &quot;zero-hour&quot; fatigue-life ratings, and owns dozens of supplemental type certificates (STCs) for aircraft modifications. These modifications are so well known and desirable in the aviation community, rebuilt Beavers are often called &quot;Kenmore Beavers&quot; or listed as having &quot;Kenmore mods&quot; installed.The original Wasp Jr radial engine of the Beaver is long out of production, so repair parts are getting harder to find. Some aircraft conversion stations have addressed this problem by replacing the piston engine with a turboprop engine such as the PT6. The added power and lighter installed weight, together with greater availability of kerosene fuel instead of high-octane aviation gasoline, make this a desirable modification, but at a high cost.

The Beaver was deployed by the British Army Air Corps during the Troubles, at least until 1979, for photo-reconnaissance missions. One of them was hit seven times by machine gun fire in South County Armagh, near the border with the Republic of Ireland in November 1979, while taking photos of an IRA checkpoint. The border crossing where the action took place became known to the British Army as &quot;Beaver Junction&quot;.

Operators of significant numbers of piston-Beavers in early 2008 include Air Saguenay and Harbour Air in Canada and Kenmore Air in the US.

American actor Harrison Ford owns a DHC-2 Beaver; he is known for referring to it as being his favourite among his entire fleet of private aircraft.The Civil Air Patrol operated many of the DHC-2 Beaver, where it was commonly used for conducting search and rescue missions. For some decades, the United States Navy has operated a pair of DHC-2s at the United States Naval Test Pilot School, where they are used to instruct students in the evaluation of lateral-directional flying qualities and for the towing of gliders.

In recent years, growing numbers of the type have been used within the leisure industry, being used for pleasure flight and as lifting platforms for skydiving and aerial film activities. The DHC-2 Beaver has been used by skydiving operators due to its good climb rate. When fitted with a roller door that can be opened in flight, it can quickly ferry eight skydivers to .

==Operators==
===Civil===
The DHC-2 is popular with air charter companies, police forces and small air taxi operators as well as private individuals and companies. Both the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Finnish Border Guard operate the aircraft. Several small airline companies in British Columbia use Beavers on scheduled routes from Vancouver to the Sunshine Coast, Vancouver Island as well as numerous nearby smaller islands. The largest of these airlines is Harbour Air.

<doc id="853003" wikidata="Q61272" url="?curid=853003" title="Christopher Franke">
<text>Christopher Franke (born 6 April 1953) is a German musician and composer. From 1971 to 1987, he was a member of the electronic group Tangerine Dream. Initially a drummer with The Agitation, later renamed Agitation Free, his primary focus eventually shifted to keyboards and synthesizers as the group moved away from its psychedelic rock origins. While he was not the first musician to use an analog sequencer, he was probably the first to turn it into a live performance instrument, thus laying the rhythmic foundation for classic Tangerine Dream pieces and indeed for the whole Berlin school sound.

After his departure from the group, he founded the Sonic Images record label, a new-age music label called Earthtone and the Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra, and produced a number of solo music works. After leaving Tangerine Dream, his only live concert was on 9 October 1991 at the Astoria Theatre in London. He performed on stage with Edgar Rothermich (a.k.a. Richard E. Roth) who is also his producer and engineer on all his solo projects and film music after 1990.

Franke moved to Los Angeles in 1991 to pursue film work. In 1995 he scored the AFI short &quot;Requiem&quot;. He may be best known for composing the music for the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, as well as the score of the anime movie &quot;Tenchi Muyo! in Love&quot; and in 2005 the music for German musical &quot;Ludwig²&quot; (with Konstantin Wecker).

<text>:&quot;This is an article about a school of thought in the area of law. For economics, see historical school of economics.&quot;
The German historical school of jurisprudence is a 19th-century intellectual movement in the study of German law. With Romanticism as its background, it conceived of law as the organic expression of a national consciousness (&quot;Volksgeist&quot;). It stood in opposition to an earlier movement called &quot;Vernunftrecht&quot; (&#x27;rational law&#x27;).

==Overview==
The historical school is based on the writings and teachings of Gustav von Hugo and especially Friedrich Carl von Savigny. Natural lawyers held that law could be discovered only by rational deduction from the nature of man.

The basic premise of the German historical school is that law is not to be regarded as an arbitrary grouping of regulations laid down by some authority. Rather, those regulations are to be seen as the expression of the convictions of the people, in the same manner as language, customs and practices are expressions of the people. The law is grounded in a form of popular consciousness called the &quot;Volksgeist&quot;.

Laws can stem from regulations by the authorities, but more commonly they evolve in an organic manner over time without interference from the authorities. The ever-changing practical needs of the people play a very important role in this continual organic development.

In the development of a legal system, is it the professional duty of lawyers – in the sense of the division of labor in society – to base their academic work on law on ascertaining the will of the people. In this way, lawyers embody the popular will.

The German historical school was divided into Romanists and the Germanists. The Romanists, to whom Savigny also belonged, held that the &quot;Volksgeist&quot; springs from the reception of the Roman law, while the Germanists (Karl Friedrich Eichhorn, Jakob Grimm, Georg Beseler, Otto von Gierke) saw medieval German law as the expression of the German &quot;Volksgeist&quot;.

The German historical school has had considerable influence on the academic study of law in Germany. Georg Friedrich Puchta and Bernhard Windscheid continued the Romanist vein founded by Savigny, leading to the so-called &quot;Pandektenwissenschaft&quot; which is seen as &quot;Begriffsjurisprudenz&quot; (&#x27;conceptual jurisprudence&#x27;).

== Criticism ==
Karl Marx devoted an 1842 essay &quot;The philosophical manifesto of the historical school of law&quot; to criticizing the historical school of law, calling it the &quot;sole frivolous product&quot; of the eighteenth century.

<doc id="853021" wikidata="Q584289" url="?curid=853021" title="Al Snow">
<text>Allen Ray Sarven (born July 18, 1963) is an American professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Al Snow. He is best known for his tenures in Extreme Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment. Snow has also held various backstage positions for professional wrestling promotions. Snow worked as a road agent for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from 2010 to 2017 and has promoted Ohio Valley Wrestling since 2018.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1982–1995)===
Sarven attended a professional wrestling try-out camp held by Ole Anderson and Gene Anderson. There he met Jim Lancaster, promoter of Ohio&#x27;s Midwest Championship Wrestling, who agreed to train him. Lancaster later described Sarven as &quot;a leader in the ring&quot; who &quot;had drive and natural ability&quot;. He made his debut on May 22, 1982. Sarven defeated Lancaster on May 5, 1985, for the Midwest Championship Wrestling title.

Sarven wrestled in various independent promotions throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, capturing both tag team and singles titles, but failed to make any big breaks. In 1993 he competed in the WWF as a jobber losing to Marty Jannetty and The Undertaker under the name Steve Moore. He gained a reputation as &quot;the best-kept secret in wrestling&quot;. Sarven helped train future Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Hall of Fame member and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dan Severn. During this time he would sometimes wrestle as Shinobi, a ninja-style masked gimmick. He wrestled in the November 19, 1994, tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but he lost to Chris Candido, the eventual winner of the tournament.

From 1995 to 1997, Snow operated a professional wrestling school called &quot;Body Slammers&quot; in Lima, Ohio, employing D&#x27;Lo Brown as an assistant trainer. It has since branched out with one of his trainers running &quot;Bodyslammers&quot; in Ottawa.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)===
After a tour of Japan, Sarven wrestled a match in Michigan against Sabu, an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) regular, who suggested he try ECW. After making his debut against The Tazmaniac and losing via pinfall on February 4, 1995, Sarven faced Chris Benoit as Al Snow, in a 15-minute match that was hailed as one of the best of the year.

===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1995)===
Sarven was also being courted by Jim Cornette for his Smoky Mountain Wrestling federation. ECW booker Paul Heyman agreed to let him work for both companies. Sarven soon found that he was not being utilized by ECW and went to Smoky Mountain full-time. In Smoky Mountain Wrestling, Snow teamed with Unabomb (Glenn Jacobs, later to be known as Kane) as the Dynamic Duo and defeated the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express for the SMW Tag Team Championship. Both wrestlers caught the attention of the World Wrestling Federation and were signed by the end of 1995.

===World Wrestling Federation (1995–1997)===

==== Various gimmicks (1995–1996) ====
Sarven began working for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) when he signed a contract in August 1995. During his tenure in the company, Sarven wrestled under numerous gimmicks, such as Avatar, which saw him come to the ring unmasked, putting on a wrestling mask to wrestle, then removing it afterwards. The gimmick was based on &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; whose popularity the company wanted to capitalize on at that time. During his particularly short run under this gimmick, Sarven&#x27;s WWF debut as Avatar took place on the October 23, 1995, episode of &quot;Monday Night RAW&quot;, defeating Bryan Walsh. About a month after his debut, he was scheduled to be the third man for The Underdogs at Survivor Series but for reasons unknown, was replaced by Bob Holly. After this, he started teaming with Aldo Montoya. His two final matches as Avatar were against Sycho Sid and 1-2-3 Kid. He was also to partake in the 1996 Royal Rumble match but once again, due to unknown reasons, never appeared. His final match in February was against Isaac Yankem. On February 20, 1996, Sarven wrestled as &quot;Shinobi&quot;, a &quot;ninja assassin&quot; hired by Jim Cornette to dispose of Shawn Michaels, who defeated Shinobi in quick fashion. Avatar returned for one last appearance against Justin Bradshaw at a house show on March 17, 1996, at Madison Square Garden in a losing effort.

==== New Rockers (1996–1997) ====
Sarven received his first mainstream exposure with the WWF as Leif Cassidy, the tag team partner of Marty Jannetty in February 1996. The duo were promoted as The New Rockers, a throwback to the original Rockers team of Jannetty and Shawn Michaels. Eventually, Jannetty left in December 1996, and Sarven was reduced to jobbing for mid-carders in January 1997. In the late 1990s, WWF and ECW began to cross-promote their organizations to counteract the success of World Championship Wrestling (WCW); Sarven was one of the wrestlers sent to Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). He left in July of that year and went to ECW. His last appearance in WWF in September 1997 was a loss to Tiger Ali Singh at WWF One Night Only.

===Return to ECW (1997–1998)===
Sarven found success back in ECW in August 1997, billed once again as Al Snow. Sarven developed a new character gimmick after reading about abnormal psychology and finding a mannequin head on the street near the ECW Arena during a Mummers Day parade. He got the idea to portray an individual with a schizophrenic disorder using the head as a prop for projection. In this role, Sarven received a lot of fan and management support for his J.O.B. Squad storyline, which promoted him as being driven insane by his years as a jobber for the WWF.

In the storyline, Snow, upset at his lot in life, asked Cactus Jack what he had to do to get anywhere in wrestling. Jack said to Snow that to become famous he had to &quot;get a little head&quot; (meaning he had to be willing to sleep with/have sex with the booker). Snow, however took this literally, and thus he started coming to the ring with the mannequin head (with the words &quot;Help Me&quot; written backwards on its forehead, an action Snow himself began to do) whom he talked to as if it were a real person, which prompted ECW crowds to chant &quot;We want Head&quot;, an intentional double entendre. ECW promoters handed out styrofoam mannequin heads at wrestling shows, and audience members started waving them and shouting, &quot;Head! Head! Head!&quot; in time to &quot;Breathe&quot; by The Prodigy, his entrance music. The entire audience would then throw the heads into the ring before the match started. The biggest match of his ECW career came when he wrestled for the promotion&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship, losing to Shane Douglas at Wrestlepalooza in 1998.

===Return to the WWF/E (1998–2008)===
====Hardcore Championship pursuits (1998–1999)====
Sarven was then recalled to the company in May 1998, where he continued his gimmick of talking to &quot;Head&quot;, creating some of the more memorable humorous skits of &quot;The Attitude Era&quot; including fighting himself in a hardcore match (which he won by putting himself through a table) and his short lived comedy tag team with Steve Blackman.

Snow received some mainstream publicity in 1999 when Wal-Mart pulled his action figure from their shelves after Sabrena Parton, a professor at Kennesaw State University, complained that &quot;Head&quot; was a &quot;decapitated woman&#x27;s head&quot; that sent an inappropriate message about violence towards women. Parton was quoted as saying &quot;What kind of message would this toy send children about brutalization of women?&quot; Sarven used the story as part of an angle in which the controversy caused Al Snow to develop depression.

At WrestleMania XV, Snow lost a WWF Hardcore Championship triple threat match involving Hardcore Holly and Billy Gunn. During the summer of 1999, at the conclusion of a storyline where Head was impaled with a spike by Prince Albert, Snow replaced Head with a chihuahua named Pepper, who he claimed talked to him. A variety of segments were broadcast showing Snow&#x27;s interactions with the dog, including bringing Pepper to the ring to either &quot;participate&quot; in matches or be held by the broadcast team. This led to a storyline where Big Boss Man kidnapped Pepper. Big Boss Man agreed to return the dog if Snow defeated him in a match for the Hardcore title; however, after losing the match he reneged and kept the dog. Later, in a segment on &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, Big Boss Man invited Snow to his hotel room to discuss the situation, before serving Snow dinner which was then revealed to be Pepper. (In a 2008 interview, Snow said that this angle had been based on a story of Mr. Fuji having done something similar with his partner Professor Tanaka&#x27;s dog.) The feud culminated at a &quot;Kennel from Hell&quot; match at Unforgiven, which consisted of a regular cage which was surrounded by a Hell in a Cell structure, with &quot;a trained pack of wild dogs&quot; in between the two, and the objective was to escape both cages without being attacked by the dogs. Snow won the match.

====Various alliances and feuds (1999–2004)====
Snow would later team with real life friend Mick Foley and became tag team champions with him for a short amount of time, but turned heel by betraying him due to Foley&#x27;s jokes about him in his autobiography, &quot;Have A Nice Day&quot;, and his growing jealousy of Foley&#x27;s tag team partner, The Rock. He would later turn face again due to fan reaction. Snow was often the butt of Foley&#x27;s jokes during Foley&#x27;s tenure as the Commissioner in 2000. However, they are close friends in real life. Foley continued to use Snow as the butt of many jokes in his second book, &quot;Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker than Wrestling&quot;.

In early 2000, he began to team with Steve Blackman as an &quot;odd couple&quot; tag team called Head Cheese (the &quot;cheese&quot; part being given various explanations, including Snow&#x27;s claim that Blackman was a voracious eater of cheese and later his attempt to force him to wear a Green Bay Packers &quot;Cheesehead&quot; hat). At WrestleMania 2000 the two suffered a loss against Test and Albert. Also in the same year, Snow won the WWF European Championship from Perry Saturn. He then began a tongue-in-cheek gimmick of entering the ring to various European countries&#x27; native music, with his theme song sung in the language of the country, and wearing attire which would suit the stereotype of that country. This continued until he lost the title to William Regal.

In 2001, Snow tried to rally support from the fans to vote for him as the new Commissioner of the company following Foley&#x27;s on-screen firing by Vince McMahon in December 2000. By March 2001, a match was set up between Snow and Regal to determine the new Commissioner, which resulted in Regal winning. Snow then took some time off from the ring in order to commit more time for the reality show &quot;Tough Enough&quot;. He made his return to the ring in October 2001 during the InVasion era and challenged Christian for the WWF European Championship at Survivor Series, which he lost.

Snow&#x27;s last championship reign came on March 11, 2002, when he defeated Goldust to win his last Hardcore Championship. He lost the title to his former &quot;Tough Enough&quot; student, Maven, a few days later. He was drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as part of the 2002 Brand Extension, where he teamed up with Maven. After taking time off again for another season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, Snow returned as a member of the &quot;Raw&quot; roster in October and eventually became a commentator for &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; alongside Jonathan Coachman. When Coachman sided with Eric Bischoff, Snow followed suit, turning heel. The two feuded with Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler, and briefly replaced them at the &quot;Raw&quot; announce table after a victory at Unforgiven in 2003. When &quot;Tough Enough IV&quot; came to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Snow was on the scene and turned face once again.

On April 12, 2004, episode of Raw, Snow dressed up as the Five Star Ninja a portray of Shinobi which he lost to Tajiri.

====Commentator and ECW (2004–2006)====
In September 2004 Snow left &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; as a commentator and went to &quot;Velocity&quot;. He continued to coach for WWE Tough Enough season 4. He did not wrestle any matches for WWE in 2005. Instead, he continued working in the independents. 

In June 2006, Snow returned to wrestling full-time as a member of the new ECW brand. His first appearance in the new brand was in the WWE vs ECW Battle Royal at the &quot;WWE vs. ECW Head to Head&quot; special, where he was accompanied by Head. He was eliminated from the match. On the June 13, 2006, debut of &quot;ECW on Sci-Fi&quot;, Snow participated in an Extreme Battle Royal, which was won by Sabu. Over the next four months, he was used sporadically, mostly as a jobber, losing to people such as Test and Kevin Thorn. Snow was taken off the ECW roster in October 2006.

====Developmental and departure (2007–2008)====
Snow then returned with the company as a trainer at Ohio Valley Wrestling in 2007. On the February 3, 2007 OVW TV tapings, Snow was named the new OVW Troubleshooter by Danny Davis in response to Danny Basham&#x27;s WWE release. On Raw XV, the 15th-Anniversary special on December 10, 2007, Snow participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal where he eliminted Doink the Clown and Gangrel. He was eliminated by Flash Funk. After WWE ceased affiliations with Ohio Valley Wrestling in February 2008, Sarven was released from his position as a trainer.

===Independent circuit (2003–2006, 2007, 2008–present)===
Snow was allowed to compete on the independent circuit while under contract with the WWE. Snow would feud with Chris Candido for Northeast Wrestling in Connecticut in the fall of 2004. On May 7, 2005, Snow teamed with D&#x27;Lo Brown losing to Mick Foley and Shane Douglas at Mark Curtis Memorial Reunion in Johnson City, Tennessee. In 2006, Snow was pinned by the Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF) Heavyweight Champion &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; Dylan Kage of Paul Bearer&#x27;s Trifecta stable at &quot;MWF Fireworks On The 4th&quot;. Snow would return to WWE&#x27;s active roster full time in June 2006. 

After being released in February 2008 by WWE, Snow has regularly competed in several independent promotions in the U.S. and Europe, especially in the U.K. and Germany. In March 2009, he made an appearance in Chikara&#x27;s King of Trios tournament, teaming up with Glacier and D&#x27;Lo Brown.

On October 21, 2022, Snow and Kal Herro won the OFE Tag Team as the Newest Rockers. Snow wore attire that he wore as Leif Cassidy.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling (2008–2017)===
In the lead-up to the December 7, 2008, TNA show Final Resolution, Mick Foley assigned himself as the special guest enforcer for the match between Kurt Angle and Rhino. Angle said he had hired &quot;another former World Champion&quot; and someone who had co-held a world tag team title with Foley. This person would debut during Angle&#x27;s match to &quot;take care of Foley&quot;. And on the night in question, Al Snow revealed himself to be the mystery ally of Angle, who interrupted the match by slapping Foley. The distraction allowed Angle to beat Rhino.

In March 2010, Sarven received a tryout as an agent for TNA Wrestling. He made his return to television on the July 15, 2010, edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, aligning himself with fellow ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Mick Foley in their invitation by Dixie Carter to TNA. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay–per–view event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company. At the event Snow was defeated by Rhino in a three-way match, which also included Brother Runt. After that, he appeared onscreen in his real-life role as company agent on multiple occasions, often alongside fellow agents Ace &quot;D&#x27;Lo Brown&quot; Conner and Pat Kenney. Sarven currently holds the title of producer for the company. In Spring 2011, Snow returned to OVW, dividing his time between his TNA duties and work as a show producer for OVW. In November of that year, OVW became TNA&#x27;s official developmental territory.

In May 2012, Snow began appearing as a judge in the monthly Gut Check segment on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. The following July, Snow started a storyline rivalry with Joey Ryan, who had been denied a spot on the TNA roster, following his appearance on TNA Gut Check. After Snow tricked Ryan into signing a contract for a match, the two met on October 14 at Bound for Glory, where Snow wrestled only his second match for TNA, losing to Ryan, following interference from Matt Morgan.
On January 12, 2013, Snow took part in Joker&#x27;s Wild (which aired May 3, 2013), teaming with recent rival Joey Ryan, in a loss against Matt Morgan and Robbie T.

On the August 7, 2014, edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Snow returned to team with Team 3D (Bully Ray and Devon) and Tommy Dreamer against Ethan Carter III, Rhino, Big Rycklon and Gene Snitsky in an eight-man Hardcore War in a winning effort.

On the February 13, 2015, edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; (which was taped on January 29), Snow returned to TV as a heel, where he was seen in the SSE Hydro, calling out Scottish wrestler and British Boot Camp 2 contestant, Grado. Grado would come out to the ring where Snow would give him the opportunity to retire from wrestling, Grado would not take the offer. On the February 20 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; (also taped January 29) Snow would face Grado in a losing effort, after which he would then go on to shake Grado&#x27;s hand turning face in the process. Afterwards, the Beat Down Clan (BDC) would go on to attack both Snow and Grado, but were saved by the debuting Drew Galloway, would fend off the BDC and who would then stand tall in the ring alongside Al Snow and his friend, Grado. At Bound for Glory 2015 Snow competed in the Bound for Gold Gauntlet. On the March 29, 2016 &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; Snow returned as a heel attacking Grado backstage.

On the April 5, 2016 &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; TNA Management Director Billy Corgan suspended Al Snow for the week without pay and said next week he must apologise. When Al Snow returned from his suspension week, he entered the ring and said the ease new talents get today with earning respect and a name in the professional wrestling business, drove him crazy as he and others of his and generations before him needed to get some for quite a long time and fight hard to prove themselves worthy back then. He invited Mahabali Shera to the ring and apologized to him for attacking him and Grado, breaking Grado&#x27;s arm in the process. Shera shook hands with him, only for Al Snow to betray and attack him once they went out of the ring. At a backstage segment, Al Snow said angrily he doesn&#x27;t need to apologize and explain himself to rookies and if they want his apology and respect they need to defeat him in a match.

A week after, Al Snow had a match with Shera in which before and a bit during the match he has blamed the wrestling changes on the fans and said they are cowards for sitting behind the barricades and not coming to the ring to face him. Shera gave a good fight, but Al Snow eventually won the match. In the May 10 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Shera and Snow had a rematch where Al Snow played games and almost won with his cheating tactics, however, he eventually failed to win due to Grado involving himself in the match, making sure Shera wins. At backstage, a bit later, Al Snow was interviewed and talked angrily, cursing Grado and Shera in the process. On May 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Al Snow went on to win a back and forth street fight against Grado with the help of the debuting Basille Baraka and Baron Dax, thus forming the tag team faction known as The Tribunal. On November 10, episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, The Tribunal attacked him until Shera made the save, turning face once again in the process. On December 8 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Snow and Shera defeated The Tribunal in a Double Strap Match to end the feud. On June 19, 2017, Al Snow was released from Impact Wrestling.

<text>Alejo Vidal-Quadras Roca (born 20 May 1945) is a Spanish former politician and radiation physicist. Born in Barcelona, he served as a Member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2014 and served as First Vice President of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2007.

== Career ==
Vidal-Quadras was elected on the People&#x27;s Party ticket and sat with the European People&#x27;s Party group. In 2014, he announced that he was leaving the People&#x27;s Party for a new party, Vox. He was the frontrunner for Vox in the 2014 European election, but the party failed to win a seat. He is a member of the European Friends of Israel, a lobby group aiming to defend Israel&#x27;s interests within the European Union.

==Relationship with Iran==
In 2013 EL Pais reported that 35 Iranian dissidents said to be affiliated to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) gave VOX about one million euros. According to Vidal-Quadras, the donations were not made to VOX but to himself.

After 2014, Vidal-Quadras operated the International Committee in Search of Justice, a Brussels-based lobby supporting the NCRI against the Iranian government.

Vidal-Quadras has aligned with People&#x27;s Mojahedin of Iran, which led the Iranian Foreign Ministry to impose sanctions on him in 2023. The Iran Foreign Ministry accused Vidal-Quadras of &quot;supporting terrorism and terrorist groups&quot; while Maryam Rajavi said that &quot;Prof. Vidal-Quadras has dedicated an important part of his life to fight against [Iran&#x27;s ruling religious fascism]&quot;.

=== Attempted assassination ===
On 9 November 2023, Vidal-Quadras was shot in the face in Madrid by a person on a motorbike in at 1:30 p.m. local time. He was taken to hospital and was described as recovering after suffering a fracture on his jawbone that required surgery. The assassination attempt is being investigated as a possible terrorist attack. On November 21, Spanish police arrested three people in connection to the shooting.

Vidal-Quadras has claimed that Iran was behind the attempted assassination. According to Vidal-Quadras, his connection to the Iranian opposition the National Council of Resistance of Iran could be linked the assassination attempt. Vidal-Quadras is one of the first politicians that Tehran has added to their terrorist list. The Iranian opposition attributes the authorship to Religious Fascism that governs the country.

In 2019 Vidal-Quadras stated that he considers the Iranian regime a cruel dictatorship which foments terrorism. He is the first European politician to be targeted within Europe.

== Aftermath ==
In January 2024, a suspect in the assassination attempt was arrested in Colombia. Currently four individuals have been arrested in connection with the shooting, while the alleged shooter, a French citizen of Tunisian descent with multiple prior convictions in France, is still at large.

Also Vidal-Quadras called for a change in the EU policy towards the Islamic Republic to avoid trying to &quot;appease, to negotiate, to dialogue and to make concessions&quot;.

== Political positions ==
Alejo Vidal-Quadras defines himself as liberal-conservative. He is opposed to abortion rights and gay marriage.

== Personal life ==
He currently lives off his pensions as a former university professor and a former member of the European Parliament. In addition to serving in the European Parliament, he has occupied several elected positions in Spain: he was a member of the Barcelona City Council (1987–1991), member of the Parliament of Catalonia (1988–1996) and Senator in the Spanish Senate (1996–1999).

<text>The Grupo Especial de Operaciones (GEO, ; &quot;&quot;, GEO), is the police tactical unit of Spain&#x27;s National Police Corps. 

==History==
With the intention of fighting against terrorism and several organized crime groups from Spain in the 1970s, in November 1977 the third section of Spanish military staff announced for members of the Policía Nacional vacancies which could be accessed freely for the newly formed Grupo Especial de Operaciones. The first training course began in March 1978.

A select group who had been months before in the GSG 9 base in San Agustín del Guadalix was selected to train this new unit. Colonel Ulrich Wegener, along with some members of his unit, took care of the equipment, the training and techniques which this new special unit in Spain would use.

The first access course of the GEO ended on 19 January 1979, with a ceremony attended by Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía of Spain. On 23 February of that year, the unit was announced to the press.

Its first planned operation took place at Madrid Barajas International Airport in August 1978 but they did not have to enter into action because the conflict was solved before their arrival. The GEO&#x27;s first action took place in Bilbao, 7 February 1981, in which five hostages were freed from two armed criminals in a branch office of the bank then known as Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. None of the criminals, hostages or police officers were hurt during the mission.

GEO was responsible for rescuing Dr. Iglesias Puga, father of singer Julio Iglesias as well as foiling an attempt by ETA to attack the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Aside from that, the GEO has disarmed several organized crime groups, arrested forty-one armed members of different terrorist groups, freed 424 persons who had been kidnapped or taken as hostages and boarded twenty ships used to carry narcotics to seize their load and arrest their crew.

During the 27 years, it has been active, five members of the GEO have died. The unit has had only one casualty in combat, which occurred during the assault on the Leganés flat where the suspected perpetrators of the Madrid train bombings of 11 March 2004 were hiding. Having realized that they were trapped, the terrorists detonated bombs in the flat killing themselves and GEO Subinspector Francisco Javier Torronteras Gadea. This fatality was probably caused by the fact that the agents who entered the flat didn&#x27;t know that the terrorists could have explosives.

As of 2005, the GEO was having problems with the number of members, which was below the necessary quantity. This meant that riot control units had to be sent to guard the Spanish embassy in Baghdad instead of GEO members, as originally intended.

On 17 August 2017, an unconfirmed amount of GEO operators were sent to Barcelona after the ramming of multiple people in the Cataluna section of the city.

==Organization==

The GEO reports to the General Operative Subdirector of the Cuerpo Nacional de Policía and its commander is a police superintendent. Its 110 members are divided into an Operative Section and a Support one.

GEO&#x27;s Operative Section is formed by two Operative Action teams, a group of Training and Specialities and a Techniques and Experiences team. The action teams are called 40 and 50 and are under the command of an inspector.

Each group, led by a Subinspector, is split into two subgroups formed by three operative commandos of five men each. Every operative commando includes two snipers, a lock picking specialist, an explosives expert, a combat diver and a special environment technician.

The Training and Specialities operative team features the instructors of the training and refresher courses. The Techniques and Experiences team tests new equipment and looks for new possible terrorist objectives.

Administrative, medical and transport personnel act as members of the Support Section. The vehicles of the GEO depend on this section.

== Capacities ==
The GEO has response capabilities and is responsible for VIP protection duties, as well as countering and responding to terrorism. 

Organized along the lines of many other police tactical units throughout Europe, the GEOs is focused on dealing with terrorist attacks, including aircraft hijackings as well as maritime threats and hostage taking. 

The GEO can also be used in a support role for Spanish Police operations outside the realm of terrorism, and is active in protecting visiting heads of state and providing security for high-profile events such as the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona. 

The GEO is a member of the ATLAS Network, that includes all the national police tactical units of European Union countries and some countries outside the European Union.

==Access and training==
Joining the GEO is accomplished by approximately 3% of the candidates every year. 

To join the GEO it is necessary to have been a member of the Cuerpo Nacional de Policía for two years, and to have at least one of the following skills: expertise in a martial art, scuba diving, being a marksmanship instructor, is an explosives expert and having worked in one of the operative groups the Police has in some province capitals.

The trial features both physical fitness and psychological tests. Its physical fitness test includes arm flexions on a bar, vertical jump, an obstacle course, running three kilometers in eleven minutes and a half, fifty meters of freestyle swimming, a strength test, a speed race and the last challenge which tests the candidates&#x27; decision-making capacity. 

On the psychological and intelligence test the mental capabilities of the candidates are checked.

===Specialization===
After having passed the access trial, GEO potential members go through a specialization course in Guadalajara which is not passed by all candidates.

There are four areas that candidates must master: instrumental, juridical, socio-professional, and police sciences and techniques. 

Police science and technique features high-speed and off-road driving, lock picking techniques, abseiling and climbing techniques, maneuvers with helicopters, transmissions, explosives and knowledge about terrorist groups. 

Instrumental area deals with physical aptitudes such as marksmanship, obstacle courses, martial arts, physical fitness, swimming, sniping, diving, and proficiency with motorcycles. 

The remaining areas are focused on the rights of terrorist groups and exchanging experience with members of similar groups of other countries.

==Equipment==
The uniform of the GEO includes: anorak, jacket, sweater, t-shirt, pants, boots and beret. Overalls are used as a complementary clothing piece. During summer, GEO members use a short-sleeved shirt instead of the sweater and the jacket.

Aside from their uniform, GEO members use protective gear which features helmets, Bolle Commando protective goggles, balaclava, Draeger gas mask, ballistic vest, Safariland sheaths for SIG P226 and gloves.
They also use vision-enhancing devices such as MATIS thermographic cameras, daylight thermographic cameras, binoculars, PalMIr 250 night vision cameras, Philips BM8028A1 binocular night vision goggles, ITT AN/AVS-9 binocular night vision goggles, ITT Pocket F6010 night vision visor and laser rangefinders.

To communicate between them they use the Matra SIRDEE (&quot;Sistema Integral de Radiodifusión Encriptada del Estado&quot;), Motorola MXR-1000 and MXR-2000 models and VHF/UHF portable repeaters.

For operations underwater they use other special gear. It includes: neoprene suits, dry suits for dives in contaminated water, &quot;twin-hose&quot; and &quot;single-hose&quot; open-circuit scubas, dive computers, underwater robots for dives up to 200 meters and dive support equipment.

The vehicles used include cars and bikes, special boats, Police helicopters and CH-47 Chinook heavy helicopters of the Spanish Army.

===Weapons===

GEO members also employ electroshock weapons, which caused some controversy when Amnesty International denounced the use of such weapons by the Policía Nacional.

To increase shooting accuracy they employ shooting support devices such as the holographic weapon sight, AMT reflex sights, Schmidt &amp; Bender 1.5 – 6 x 42 daylight sights, Simrad KN250F night vision sights, Zeiss Diavari daylight sights, Varo AN/PVS-4 night vision sights, EDS laser sights and Sure-Fire flashlights.

<doc id="853048" wikidata="Q7361491" url="?curid=853048" title="Roma Street railway station">
<text>Roma Street railway station is a commuter and long-distance passenger train station located in the central business district of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is the junction station for the North Coast, Main, Gold Coast and NSW North Coast lines. The station is one of four inner city stations that form a core corridor through the centre of Brisbane.

Although not easily visible to the public, the original 1873 Roma Street railway station building still exists within the modern complex and is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.

==History==
===1800s to 1940s===

The construction of a railway station on Roma Street was part of a plan to extend the Main Line to Brisbane. An iron station building designed by Sir Charles Fox &amp; Sons was to be imported from the United Kingdom for this purpose, but economic problems in Queensland led to the order being cancelled. In 1873, the Superintendent of Public Buildings Francis Stanley designed a smaller station for the site, with construction beginning in the same year under John Petrie. The station was officially opened on 14 June 1875 as Brisbane at the same time that the Main Line opened to Indooroopilly.

A goods and carriage shed were added shortly after. In 1882, Roma Street became a junction station with the North Coast line opening to Sandgate. With the opening of Central station as Brisbane&#x27;s principal station on 18 August 1889, the station was renamed Roma Street. As traffic grew, so did the Roma Street precinct with a locomotive shed added.

In 1911, the precinct was rearranged with the locomotive and carriage sheds relocated to Mayne near Bowen Hills.

On 30 November 1940, Roma Street again became the principal station for long-distance services with new platforms built to the south of the existing platforms.

===1970s to early 2000s===

Following the opening of the Merivale Bridge on 18 November 1978, Roma Street was also served by Beenleigh line services. On 21 June 1986, it became a dual gauge station with the extension of the standard gauge NSW North Coast line from South Brisbane. In October 1986, the Brisbane Transit Centre opened to the south of the station.

As part of the quadruplication of the North Coast line to Bowen Hills, the station was rebuilt. On 1 November 1995, a new Platform 10 was opened on the station&#x27;s north side as the platform for long-distance services; these services had previously used Platforms 2 and 3. Platforms 7, 8 and 9 opened on 11 June 1996 while refurbished Platforms 4, 5 and 6 reopened in January 1997.

In 2001, Roma Street Parkland opened to the north of the station on the site of the former Roma Street goods yards. Visitors not travelling on Queensland Rail services can obtain a free pass to transit through the station concourse from Roma Street to the parklands.

Platform 1 became part of the Roma Street busway station on 19 May 2008, with the construction of the Inner Northern Busway.

===Cross River Rail and Brisbane Metro Projects===

Roma Street Station will be affected by both the Cross River Rail and Brisbane Metro projects.

The Brisbane Transit Centre complex was planned to be demolished in 2020. Businesses in the existing buildings were closed down between late 2018 and early 2019, with reports of controversy surrounding claims for compensation by small business tenants.

According to the Cross River Rail Construction plan, new underground platforms will be constructed to service Cross River Rail services. The next stations for the Cross River Rail services will be Albert Street (southbound) and Exhibition (northbound).

The proposed Brisbane Metro Line 1 services will terminate at Roma Street Station, with the previous station being King George Square. Brisbane Metro Line 2 services will continue through Roma Street following the existing Northern Busway route, with the next stations being Normanby (northbound) and King George Square (southbound).

Due to the anticipated demolition of the Brisbane Transit Centre, a temporary long-distance bus terminal was constructed on the opposite side of Roma Street Station (near Platform 10) and opened in September 2019.

The Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) Else broke through into the new Roma Street station cavern on the 6 August 2021. The second one, TBM Merle, arrived on 23 August 2021.

==Services==
Roma Street station is served by all suburban and interurban City network lines.

It is also the terminus station for long-distance Traveltrain services and NSW TrainLink&#x27;s service to Sydney. A motorail loading dock was previously located on Platform 10 but it was removed in 2015.

==Services by platform==
==Transport links==
To the north of the station is the Brisbane Coach Terminal that opened in 2019 as replacement for the Brisbane Transit Centre. It is used by long distance Bus Queensland, Crisps Coaches, Greyhound Australia, Murrays, NSW TrainLink and Premier Motor Service services.

To the south of the station is Roma Street busway station on the Northern Busway that is served by Transport for Brisbane.

<text>António Luís Santos da Costa (; born 17 July 1961) is a Portuguese lawyer and politician who has served as President of the European Council since 2024.

He previously served as the 118th Prime Minister of Portugal from 2015 to 2024, presiding over the XXI (2015–2019), XXII (2019–2022) and XXIII Constitutional Governments (2022–2024). Costa&#x27;s near 9-year tenure as Prime Minister is the second longest, with Costa also being the longest serving politician in government functions, in Portuguese democracy, and the longest of any Iberian Peninsula national leader in the 21st century.

Previously, he was Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs from 1995 to 1997, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs from 1997 to 1999, Minister of Justice from 1999 to 2002, Minister of Internal Administration from 2005 to 2007, as well as Mayor of Lisbon from 2007 to 2015. He was elected Secretary-General of the Socialist Party in 2014, a post he held until early 2024.

On 7 November 2023, Costa resigned following an investigation involving members of his government in connection with alleged corruption and malfeasance in handling lithium mining and hydrogen projects in the country.

The President of Portugal decided to dissolve Parliament and called for a snap election, held on 10 March 2024. Costa stayed as Prime Minister in a caretaker capacity until his successor, hitherto leader of the opposition Luís Montenegro, was sworn in on 2 April 2024.

In December 2024 Costa succeeded Charles Michel as President of the European Council.

==Early life and education==
António Luís Santos da Costa was born on 17 July 1961 in Lisbon, Portugal, the son of writer Orlando da Costa and journalist Maria Antónia Palla. He is of French, Mozambican, and Goan descent. In Goa, Costa is affectionately known as &quot;Babush&quot;, a word in Konkani meaning &#x27;a young loved one&#x27;.

Costa graduated from the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon in the 1980s when he first entered politics and was elected as a Socialist deputy to the municipal council. He completed the mandatory military service in 1987 and later practised law briefly from 1988, before entering politics full-time.

==Political career==

António Costa joined the Socialist Youth in 1975, at the age of fourteen. In the 1982 local elections, Costa was elected as a member of the Lisbon municipal assembly, being re-elected in 1985 and 1989. In the 1991 legislative election, Costa was elected as member of the Assembly of the Republic from the district of Lisbon.

For the 1993 local elections, Costa was picked as the mayoral candidate for the municipality of Loures, a suburb of Lisbon. This contest threw national attention because Costa did a campaign stunt by promoting a race between a Ferrari and a Donkey to highlight the difficulty in roads and transportation to Lisbon, and to point for the necessity of better roads and a subway connection to Loures. Costa narrowly lost the mayoral race to the Unitary Democratic Coalition (CDU) candidate by a 35 to 34 percent margin. 

In the 1996 presidential election, António Costa was the campaign director of Jorge Sampaio&#x27;s successful run for the Presidency of the Republic. Costa&#x27;s first role in a Socialist government was as Minister of Parliamentary Affairs under Prime Minister António Guterres between 1997 and 1999. In Guterres&#x27; second term, Costa held the office of Minister of Justice from 1999 to 2002. Costa also coordinated the organization of the Expo &#x27;98 in Lisbon.

In the 2002 legislative election, Costa was elected a member of parliament from the district of Leiria and, due the defeat of the PS in this election, became the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader in opposition. During the 2003 Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal, António Costa&#x27;s name was involved in wiretaps where he appears to want to interfere with the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office to avoid the arrest of the PS deputy Paulo Pedroso. Costa was a member of the European Parliament for the Socialist Party (PES), heading the list for the 2004 European elections after the death of top candidate António de Sousa Franco. On 20 July 2004, he was elected as one of the 14 vice-presidents of the European Parliament. He also served on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.

Costa resigned as an MEP on 11 March 2005 to become Minister of State and Internal Administration in the government of José Sócrates following the 2005 national elections.

===Mayor of Lisbon===
António Costa resigned from all government offices in May 2007 to become his party&#x27;s candidate for the municipality of Lisbon, Portugal&#x27;s capital city. He was elected as Lisbon&#x27;s mayor on 15 July 2007 and reelected in 2009 and 2013, with a bigger majority each time. In April 2015 he resigned his duties as a mayor, while he was already the secretary general of the Socialist Party and the party&#x27;s candidate for Prime Minister, so that he could prepare his campaign for the October 2015 general elections.

===Candidate for prime minister===
In September 2014, the Socialist Party chose Costa as its candidate to be prime minister of Portugal in the 2015 national elections. In a ballot to select the party&#x27;s candidate, gaining nearly 70 per cent of the votes, he defeated party leader António José Seguro, who announced his resignation after the result. By April 2015, he stepped down as mayor to focus on his campaign.

During the campaign, Costa pledged to ease back on austerity and give more disposable income back to households. He proposed to boost incomes, hiring and growth to cut the budget deficits while scrapping austerity measures and cutting taxes for the middle and lower classes, asserting that would still allow deficits to reduce in line with the Euro convergence criteria. Also, he pledged to roll back a hugely unpopular hike in value added tax on restaurants and reinstate some benefits for civil servants.

==Prime Minister of Portugal==
=== First term (2015–2019) ===
On 4 October 2015, the conservative Portugal Ahead coalition that had ruled the country since 2011 came first in the elections winning 38.6% of the vote, while the Socialist Party (PS) came second with 32.3%. Passos Coelho was reappointed Prime Minister the following days, but António Costa formed an alliance with the other parties on the left (the Left Bloc, the Portuguese Communist Party and the Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot;), which altogether constituted a majority in Parliament, and toppled the government on 10 November (the People–Animals–Nature party also voted in favour of the motion of rejection presented by the left alliance). After toppling the conservative government, Costa was chosen as the new prime minister of Portugal by President Cavaco Silva on 24 November and assumed office on 26 November.

By March 2017, polls put support for Costa&#x27;s Socialists at 42 per cent, up 10 points from their share of the vote in the 2015 election and close to a level that would give them a majority in parliament were the country to vote again. In the 2017 local elections, Costa further consolidated power in Portugal as his party captured a record haul of 158 town halls out of the country&#x27;s 308 cities and towns; nationwide, the Socialists’ vote share topped 38 per cent, again up from their result in the 2015 parliamentary election.

During his tenure, Portugal experienced its deadliest wildfires ever, firstly in Pedrogão Grande in June 2017 (65 dead) and later across the country in October 2017 (41 dead). In October 2017, the opposition People&#x27;s Party (CDS) launched a motion of no-confidence in Costa&#x27;s government over its failure to prevent the loss of human lives in the lethal Iberian wildfires, the second such disaster in four months; the motion was largely symbolic as the minority Socialist government continued to be backed in parliament by two left-wing parties.

In April 2018, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that, &quot;Since coming to power, Costa&#x27;s government has managed to combine fiscal discipline with measures to support growth, while reversing most of the austerity policies imposed by the previous centre-right administration during the 2010–13 debt crisis. 

In early 2019, Costa&#x27;s government survived another opposition motion of no confidence lodged over a wave of public sector strikes. Ahead of the 2019 national elections, Costa ruled out a coalition government with the hard left if, as expected, his governing party won the election but fell shy of a parliamentary majority. Instead, he indicated he favoured a continuation of the current pact in parliament with the Communists and/or the Left Bloc – rather than any formal coalition in which they would have government ministers.

=== Second term (2019–2022) ===

Costa&#x27;s second government was sworn in on 26 October 2019, the biggest government in Portuguese democracy, with 70 members: 20 ministers, including the Prime Minister, and 50 secretaries of state. This government would prove to be very unstable due to the lack of an agreement between the left-wing parties, and, in the vote of the 2020 budget, BE and CDU abstained while the Socialists were the only party voting in favour.

Despite the political instability from the lack of an agreement, the XXII government was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first case appeared on 2 March 2020, and shortly after, the government declared a state of emergency, that was signed by the President, and a lockdown was also issued. The lockdown and restrictions were lifted in June 2020, but new measures would be enacted in the following months as infections and deaths rose. By mid-2022, Portugal had become one the worst affected countries in the world by the pandemic, with a death rate of 25.8 per 1 million, and an infection rate of 1,090 per 1 million. The Covid vaccination campaign in Portugal, led by Admiral Henrique Gouveia e Melo, which was nominated by the government, was a major success with more than 28 million vaccines given and nearly 9 million people fully vaccinated (85% of the population), one of the biggest rates in the world.

Between 1 January and 30 June 2021, António Costa presided over the Council of the European Union. In the 2021 local elections, the Socialist Party remained the largest party in the country but suffered heavy losses in several cities, especially Lisbon which was lost to a centre-right coalition. The results were seen as a &quot;yellow card&quot; to António Costa. At the same time, the left-wing parties, BE and CDU, were threatening to reject the 2022 budget if Costa&#x27;s government didn&#x27;t made more concessions. The President warned that budget rejection would lead to snap elections, which ultimately happened as the left-wing parties joined forces with the right-wing and rejected the 2022 budget, the first rejection in democracy. Snap elections were called for 30 January 2022.

=== Third term (2022–2024) ===
 Costa was re-elected in the 2022 Portuguese legislative election, with the PS winning 120 seats, up from 108 seats, in a surprise outright majority in the Assembly. In the weeks leading up to the election, polling suggested that Costa and the Socialist Party would retain their status as the largest party in the Assembly but would need the help of other parties to achieve a majority. In his victory speech, Costa thanked voters for giving him &quot;an increased responsibility&quot; and promising to govern &quot;with and for all Portuguese&quot;. This gave him the mandate to form the XXIII Constitutional Government of Portugal.

Costa&#x27;s third term was marred by a wave of scandals and resignations that affected his popularity negatively in the opinion polls. 11 ministers and secretaries of state left their roles, over allegations of corruption and past misconduct or questionable practices. The most significant scandal was the TAP scandal where Costa&#x27;s government has been involved. Infrastructure Minister Pedro Nuno Santos submitted his resignation in December 2022, following a public backlash over a hefty severance pay a secretary of state received from state-owned TAP, which fell under his remit.

Costa replaced Santos with João Galamba who submitted his resignation in May 2023 as the TAP scandal widened. Opposition parties said that Galamba concealed from parliament that he had proposed that then TAP CEO Christine Ourmières-Widener meet Socialist lawmakers to prepare for a parliamentary hearing about her severance package. Widener was later fired after an official inspection found that the severance was illegal. Galamba initially said the preparatory meeting was TAP&#x27;s idea, but acknowledged it was he who had told Widener that, if she wanted, she could attend the meeting where his advisors would also be present.

Galamba added that one of his advisors, who took notes on what was discussed at the meeting, had been fired, and taken a laptop with confidential information with him. The laptop was later recovered by the national intelligence service SIS, leading to accusations from the opposition of a government overreach since such cases were a police matter. Costa denied that neither he nor any member of the government had given orders to SIS to recover the laptop. He added that he would reject the resignation of Galamba, keeping him in the job against president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa&#x27;s and the opposition&#x27;s request. President Rebelo de Sousa responded by issuing a warning that Costa&#x27;s government needed to work on preserving its credibility, while refraining from using his power to dissolve parliament.

==== Resignation ====
On 7 November 2023, Portuguese prosecutors detained Costa&#x27;s chief of staff Vítor Escária and named João Galamba a formal suspect in an investigation into alleged corruption in lithium mining, green hydrogen production and a data centre deals. Over 40 searches were carried out, some of which in government and local government buildings, including Escária&#x27;s office, the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Action. Costa was also under suspicion of enabling the lithium and green hydrogen deals, and was to be inquired by the Supreme Court of Justice.

In a televised statement in the afternoon, Costa announced his resignation from the position of prime minister, saying that &quot;the dignity of the functions of prime minister is not compatible with any suspicion about his integrity, his good conduct and even less with the suspicion of the practice of any criminal act&quot;.

The President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, accepted Costa&#x27;s resignation on the same day. However, the resignation of Costa and his government was only made official on 8 December, to have the State Budget for 2024 approved. The Assembly of the Republic was also dissolved. The president scheduled early elections to be held on 10 March 2024. Costa&#x27;s government remained in office in a caretaker capacity until the new government (led by Luis Montenegro) was sworn in after the elections.

The investigation has since attracted criticism after the prosecutors admitted several mistakes, including confusion between the names of António Costa and then Minister of Economy António Costa Silva in the transcript of a wiretap.

== President of the European Council ==

In the aftermath of the 2024 European Parliament election, Costa was seen as the frontrunner candidate for the Presidency of the European Council. On 27 June 2024, António Costa was elected as President of the European Council, one of the three most important leadership posts of the European Union, by the 27 EU member state leaders. He started in the position on 1 December 2024.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Costa married Fernanda Maria Gonçalves Tadeu, a teacher. The couple have a son and a daughter. Costa also holds an Overseas Citizenship of India.

Costa is a supporter of the football club S.L. Benfica, and was a frequent spectator at their matches while mayor of Lisbon. He also accompanied Benfica to both UEFA Europa League finals, in 2013 and 2014.

<text>Paul Fauconnet (March 13, 1874 in Saint-Denis – 1938) was a French sociologist who is best known as a contributor to the &quot;L&#x27;Année Sociologique&quot;.

== Biography ==
Fauconnet aggregated in philosophy in 1892 and earned his doctorate in philosophy in 1895. He also earned a further doctorate in law in 1920, although his interest in the law was purely scholarly and he never practiced as a lawyer. He became a professor at the faculty of letters in 1907 at the University of Toulouse and later chargé de cours (lecturer) at the faculty of letters in 1921 in Paris, obtaining a chair in 1932. His dissertation was entitled &quot;La responsabilité: Etude de sociologie&quot; (Paris: Alcan, 1920; 2nd edn 1928). It adopts and develops Emile Durkheim&#x27;s teachings on the nature of criminal justice and punishment.

Durkheim&#x27;s definition of sociology as &quot;the science of institutions, of their genesis and functioning&quot; was derived from Fauconnet&#x27;s contribution on sociology, coauthored with Marcel Mauss, to &quot;La Grande Encyclopédie&quot; in 1901.

<doc id="853078" wikidata="Q5978048" url="?curid=853078" title="I Love Bees">
<text>I Love Bees (also known as ilovebees or ILB for short) was an alternate reality game (ARG) that served as both a real-world experience and viral marketing campaign for the release of developer Bungie&#x27;s 2004 video game &quot;Halo 2&quot;. The game was created and developed by 42 Entertainment. Many of the same personnel had previously created an ARG for the film &quot;A.I.&quot; titled &quot;The Beast&quot;. &quot;I Love Bees&quot; was commissioned by Microsoft, &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s publisher and Bungie&#x27;s ultimate parent company at the time.

&quot;I Love Bees&quot; was first advertised by a hidden message in a &quot;Halo 2&quot; trailer; players who investigated the titular website discovered that the pages appeared to be hacked by a mysterious intelligence. As players solved puzzles, audio logs were posted to the ilovebees.com site which gradually revealed more of the fictional back-story, involving a marooned artificial intelligence stranded on Earth and its attempts to put itself back together.

250,000 people viewed the ilovebees website when it was launched in July 2004, and more than 500,000 returned to the site every time the pages were updated. More than three million visitors viewed the site over the course of three months, and thousands of people around the world participated in the game. &quot;I Love Bees&quot; won numerous awards for its innovation and helped spawn numerous other alternate reality games for video games.

==Overview==
Alternate reality games or ARGs are designed to involve fans of video games or other media in a form of viral marketing which CNET described as encompassing &quot;real-life treasure hunting, interactive storytelling, video games and online [communities]&quot;. &quot;I Love Bees&quot; began when jars of honey were received in the mail by people who had previously participated in alternate reality games. The jars contained letters leading to the I Love Bees website and a countdown. At around the same time, theatrical trailers for &quot;Halo 2&quot; concluded with the Xbox logo and a URL, Xbox.com, that quickly flashed a link to ilovebees.com, ostensibly a hacked site related to beekeeping.

Both events, not connected publicly for several weeks, caused the curious to visit the website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting that this was a mystery that could be unraveled, &quot;Halo&quot; and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on.
The gameplay of &quot;I Love Bees&quot; tasked players around the world to work together to solve problems, with little or no direction or guidance. For example, the game presented players with 210 pairs of global positioning system coordinates and time codes, with no indications to what the locations referred to. Players eventually figured out the coordinates referred to pay phones and the times to when the phones would ring; one player in Florida stayed by a phone while Hurricane Frances was minutes away in order to recite answers to prerecorded questions. Other phone calls were made by a live person known as the &quot;operator,&quot; voiced by veteran voice actor Kristen Rutherford; these calls allowed players to interact with the characters of the games in spontaneous and occasionally humorous ways. Other players treated the corrupted data on ilovebees.com as encrypted files to decipher, or used image files found on the web server to solve puzzles. After players completed certain tasks, they were rewarded with new installments to an audio drama which revealed the reasons for the ilovebees.com malfunction.

Over time, the game&#x27;s mechanisms for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters. The game culminated by inviting players of the game to visit one of four cinemas where they could get a chance to play &quot;Halo 2&quot; before its release and collect a commemorative DVD.

==Plot==
The game&#x27;s plot begins with a military spaceship crashing to Earth in an unknown location, leaving the craft&#x27;s controlling artificial intelligence (AI) damaged. This AI, known as the &quot;Operator&quot; or &quot;Melissa&quot;, is not alone; other AI programs share its system. In an effort to survive and contact any surviving allies, Melissa transfers herself to a San Francisco-area web server, which happens to host a bee enthusiast website known as &quot;I Love Bees&quot;. To the distress of Dana Awbrey, the website&#x27;s maintainer, Melissa&#x27;s attempts to send signals began to appear largely as codes, hidden in images or other text, interfering with the operation of the &quot;I Love Bees&quot; site and corrupting much of the content.

Dana, attempting to regain control over the corrupted website, accidentally erases data which comprises part of Melissa&#x27;s memory. Furious, Melissa lashes out at the webmaster, obtaining pictures of her using the webcam on her computer and promising to take revenge. Alarmed, Dana announces that she is removing herself from the situation and is taking a previously planned trip to China earlier than expected.

All AI units contain a program called SPDR, short for System Peril Distributed Reflex. As SPDR attempts to fix Melissa, random dumps from Melissa&#x27;s memory began to spill into the website, largely detailing Melissa&#x27;s history and revealing the presence of a malicious Trojan-horse virus known as the &quot;Pious Flea.&quot; The Spider tries to erase the Flea but is outwitted, as Melissa erases the Spider instead of the Flea. The Flea continues to overwrite Melissa&#x27;s programming with its own mysterious goals, with it eventually being revealed that it is actually an espionage AI more properly called the Seeker, built by the Covenant.

With the assistance of other characters revealed by audio chapters, the fictional protagonists break into a secure military installation and manage to deactivate a Forerunner device which is implied to begin the firing sequence of the Halo installations. However, the price paid for the deactivation is a powerful energy transmission alerting the Covenant to the location of Earth. Whole again, Melissa sees how she has been manipulated by the Pious Flea, and returns to her time. &quot;I Love Bees&quot; ends with the Covenant invading Earth, corresponding to a major plot point in &quot;Halo 2&quot;.

Due to Bungie&#x27;s commitment to the development of &quot;Halo 2&quot; during &quot;I Love Bees&quot;″ run, they were unable to assist 42 Entertainment with story creation, and so the ARG&#x27;s story is only tangentially related to the main &quot;Halo&quot; storyline. The events of &quot;I Love Bees&quot; were, therefore, originally not considered to be &quot;Halo&quot; canon. In a 2006 interview, however, Bungie&#x27;s content manager Frank O&#x27;Connor expressly confirmed that &quot;I Love Bees&quot; is part of &quot;things that we embrace as canon.&quot; References to elements of &quot;I Love Bees&quot; have since appeared in the 2006 Halo Graphic Novel and the 2009 Halo Encyclopedia, both of which are official canon.

==Development==

&quot;I Love Bees&quot;″ developer, 42 Entertainment, was founded by Jordan Weisman, the former creative director for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox division. 42 Entertainment had previously created the first ARG, &quot;The Beast&quot;, which had been used to promote the movie &quot;A.I.&quot;. Other members of the &quot;I Love Bees&quot; team included Sean Stewart, a World Fantasy Award-award-winning author who served as &quot;I Love Bees&quot;″ writer, and Jim Stewartson, &quot;I Love Bees&quot;″ technical lead who produced the first commercial 3D game delivered by the internet. Weisman stated that the goal of &quot;I Love Bees&quot; was to utilize every person who interacted with the game, and to use any electronic resource to do so: &quot;If we could make your toaster print something we would. Anything with an electric current running through it. A single story, a single gaming experience, with no boundaries. A game that is life itself.&quot;

42 Entertainment conceived &quot;I Love Bees&quot; as a radio drama, and used the pay phones as a way to excite players. Chris Di Cesare, Microsoft&#x27;s director of marketing, stated that the radio drama&#x27;s similarities with &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; was intentional, and that &quot;[&quot;ILB&quot;] remains true to the radio drama tradition of Orson Welles that we were shooting for and also allowed us to tell the story in an unorthodox way.&quot; In order to prevent non-players from being scared by the sounds of gunfire from the pay phones, 42 Entertainment established passwords that had to be repeated. Stewart described writing for the game as more enjoyable than writing printed fiction, both for the money and the unique experience of ARGs as opposed to other media:

The audiences that we built for those campaigns are having a different experience. They&#x27;re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn&#x27;t really have an analog that I&#x27;ve been able to think of in the arts.

==Reception==
&quot;I Love Bees&quot; is credited with helping drive attention to &quot;Halo 2&quot;; former &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editor Dan Hsu stated in an interview that &quot;&quot;I Love Bees&quot; really got existing gamers and other consumers talking about the universe of [Halo].&quot; Billy Pidgeon, a game analyst, noted that &quot;I Love Bees&quot; achieved what it had been designed to do: &quot;This kind of viral guerrilla marketing worked ... Everyone started instant messaging about it and checking out the site.&quot; &quot;I Love Bees&quot; not only received coverage from gaming publications, but attracted mainstream press attention as well. At its height, ilovebees received between two and three million unique visitors over the course of three months. 9,000 people also actively participated in the real-world aspects of the game. The players of &quot;I Love Bees&quot; themselves were quite varied. The target demographic for the promotion was younger males, but one player noted that even middle-aged men and women were engaged in the game.

&quot;I Love Bees&quot; received several awards for its innovation. The design team was one of the recipients of the Innovation Award at the 5th annual Game Developers Choice Awards. I Love Bees was also announced as the winner of a Webby Award in the Game-Related category, presented by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.

===Legacy===
Along with 42 Entertainment&#x27;s previous ARG known as &quot;The Beast&quot;, &quot;I Love Bees&quot; is credited with bringing greater attention to the fledgling marketing form; &quot;I Love Bees&quot; not only helped assuage fears by marketers about the costs of ARG failure, but attracted interest from other game developers in using alternate reality games to promote their own products. Before &quot;I Love Bees&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;ARGs were destined to join Letsbuyit.com and Barcode Battlers in the e-dustbin of nice ideas that never really caught on&quot;; the explosion of broadband internet access and a renewed interest in codes allowed &quot;I Love Bees&quot; to become wildly successful. Bungie would later use another ARG called &quot;Iris&quot; to promote &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s sequel, &quot;Halo 3&quot;.

&quot;I Love Bees&quot; also attracted attention in the wider discussion of user-based marketing and cooperation. Author Charles Leadbeater argued that &quot;I Love Bees&quot; was an example of &quot;We-Think&quot; collective thinking; Leadbeater noted that after the &quot;puppet masters&quot; began the game, &quot;I Love Bees&quot; &quot;displayed all the characteristics of a mass movement, propelled into existence in a matter of weeks simply by collective enthusiasm guided by a few cyberspace &#x27;avatars&#x27;&quot;. The game proved successful with gamers, as well as attracting nontraditional players who had no experience with &quot;Halo&quot; before joining the game.
In a 2016 Bandcamp interview, artist Ramona Andra Xavier, known for pioneering the Vaporwave musical genre under the pseudonym Vektroid (among others), claimed to be acutely influenced by &quot;&quot;I Love Bees&quot;,&quot; in its use of &quot;hacked&quot; websites, internet communities and IRL tasks to blur the lines between reality and fiction.

<doc id="853083" wikidata="Q5188120" url="?curid=853083" title="Cross-check (chess)">
<text>In chess, a cross-check (or counter-check) is a tactic in which a check is played in response to a check, especially when the original check is blocked by a piece that itself either delivers check or reveals a discovered check from another piece. Sometimes the term is extended to cover cases in which the king moves out of check and reveals a discovered check from another piece (this is also known as a &quot;royal check&quot;); it does not generally apply to cases where the original checking piece is captured.

The cross-check is an essential tactic in winning some endgames such as those with two queens versus one, or a queen and pawn versus a queen. In these cases, the defense usually tries for a perpetual check and sometimes the stronger side can stop it only by a cross-check.
==Examples==
A cross-check occurs from time to time in games. It is an essential tactic in winning endgames such as two queens versus one queen, or queen and pawn versus queen, where it is used to stop a series of checks from the opponent and force the exchange of queens. It is also used in some chess problems.

===Botvinnik vs. Minev game===
Cross-checks are rare in actual play, though they do occur, and in some endgames, particularly queen endgames, they are very important. The position shown to the right is the final position in the famous queen endgame from the game between Mikhail Botvinnik and Nikolay Minev, Amsterdam Olympiad, 1954. In the position shown, after 91. Kc5!!, Black resigned because the promising looking checks 91...Qc7+, 91...Qg1+, 91...Qf2+ and 91...Qc2+ are answered by the cross-checks 92.Qc6+, 92.Qd4+, 92.Qd4+ and 92.Qc4+ respectively, forcing an exchange of queens in all cases, which will result in the promotion of the pawn and winning the game by a basic checkmate. This is an important theme in queen endgames: the weaker side often gives a series of checks, and it is frequently important for them to avoid simplifying cross-checks such as these in reply , . If the black queen attacks the pawn instead of checking it does no good since the promotion square of the pawn is protected by its queen. Note too that if Black instead merely allows the pawn&#x27;s promotion, another cross-check may be necessary to win, as in the next section.
===Two queens versus one===

In the position on the left from Botvinnik–Ravinsky, Black resigned. With best play according to the endgame tablebase, 126...Kb3 127.Qf7+ Ka4 128.g8=Q Qg4+ 129.Kh6 Qh4+ 130.Kg7 Qg3+ 131.Kf8 Qd6+ 132.Qe7 Qh6+ 133.Qgg7 Qf4+ 134.Qgf7 Qb8+ and the position on the right is reached. Then the cross-check 135.Qee8+ (or Qfe8+) forks the king and queen, forces an exchange, and wins the game.

===Anderson problem, 1919===
Cross-checks are relatively infrequent in actual play, but are popular in chess problems since they make for a relatively unobvious solution. In the problem shown to the right, White is to move and mate in two moves against any defence. It is by G.F. Anderson and was first published in &quot;Il Secolo&quot; in 1919. The key 1.Kd6, threatening 2.Qb7#, gives the black king two flight squares, and two of the variations exploit these: 1...Kb6 2.Bc2# and 1...Kb4 2.Kxc6#. The other two defences exploit the fact that the key exposes the white king to checks, and are answered by cross-checks: 1...Rg6+ 2.Be6# and 1...Rd3+ 2.Bd5#.
===Anderson problem, 1961===

The problem to the right, also by G. F. Anderson (first published in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1961) and also a mate in two, features no fewer than five cross-checks. The key is 1.Qb6 (threat: 2.Ne4#), with the following variations:

:1...exf6+ 2.Nb7#
:1...exd6+ 2.Nd7#
:1...Nd4+ 2.Rf5#
:1...Nxd6+ 2.Nd3#
:1...Nf-other+ 2.Ne4#
:1...Kxf6 2.Qb2#
:1...Kxd6 2.Rd4#

<text>The St. George Dragons are an Australian rugby league football club from the St George District in Sydney, New South Wales that played in the top level New South Wales competition and Australian Rugby League competitions from the 1921 until the 1997 ARL season, as well as the unified 1998 National Rugby League season. On 23 September 1998, the club formed a joint venture with the Illawarra Steelers, creating the St. George Illawarra Dragons team which competed in the 1999 NRL season and continues to compete in the league today. As a stand-alone club, it fields teams in the NSWRL underage men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions, Harold Matthews Cup, S.G. Ball, Lisa Fiaola Cup, and Tarsha Gale Cup.

Entering the New South Wales Rugby Football League in 1921, the St George club won 15 premierships including 11 in succession between 1956 and 1966, still an equal current world record for sporting competitions (shared with Bayern Munich). The Dragons thus are equal second along with the Sydney Roosters, to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in terms of total premierships won in the NSW Rugby Football League. Following the Super League war and formation of the NRL in 1998, the club still remains in a joint venture with the Illawarra Steelers known as the St. George Illawarra Dragons.

== History ==
=== Formative years ===
On Friday, 28 February 1908 at Rockdale Town Hall a meeting mainly instigated by St George rugby league pioneers, W. Munn and Joe McGraw, was attended by officials of the recently-formed New South Wales Rugby Football League and rugby players from the local district. NSWRFL president Henry Hoyle gave a convincing address and a St. George club appeared likely to form, However, the club&#x27;s application was later rejected due to an insufficient number of players. Undeterred, the St George Rugby League Football Club took form in 1910 when a team played in the NSWRL 3rd Grade Competition. The club&#x27;s first game took place against Newtown at Sans Souci and St George were victorious 36–0.
With the demise of Annandale Rugby League Club, St George was successful in November 1920 in petitioning the NSWRL for promotion. In February 1921 at the Kogarah School of Arts, the St George District Rugby League Club was founded. The first President was Arthur Yager, with Joe McGraw chosen as Secretary, Arthur Moymow named Treasurer and Allan Clark as the first club delegate to the NSWRFL. Baden Wales was delegate to the Juniors.

The club&#x27;s inaugural captain was Dual-code rugby international, Herb Gilbert who joined the club at aged 33 as captain-coach.

The club&#x27;s inaugural first grade appearance was on St George&#x27;s Day, 23 April 1921 against Glebe at the Sydney Sports Ground. The first St George team to take the field was: Lyall Wall, Norm Shadlow, Reg Fusedale, Herb Gilbert (c), George Carstairs, Frank Gray, Tommy Burns, Tony Redmond, Clarrie Tye, Sid Field, Roy Bossi, Ernie Lapham and Jack Clark. Glebe won the encounter 4–3. St George won only two matches in their first season and finished equal second last in the premiership.
Before the start of the 1921 season, trial matches were played at Sans Souci and training took place at the Drill Hall in the Sydney suburb of Arncliffe. During the 1921 season games were played at Hurstville Oval. In 1925 the club started using Earl Park at Arncliffe as its headquarters and home ground. The club played at Earl Park until the end of the 1939 season.

The new club struggled during the 1920s finishing last in 1926 and eight points behind the next placed team. The hiring of another 33-year-old veteran leader in Frank Burge saw a change in the club&#x27;s fortunes. In 1927 under Burge, the &quot;Dragon Slayers&quot;, as they were then known, qualified for their first final but were beaten by South Sydney. For each of the next three seasons the Dragons qualified for the semifinals and in 1930 they beat Wests in the final, only to suffer a return loss when Wests exercised their prerogative of the time as minor premiers to request a Grand final challenge rematch.

===1930s===
Harry Kadwell, the former South Sydney player and international half-back took over from Burge as captain-coach in 1931 and had four seasons with the club before his retirement. His leadership partner was the uncompromising hooker &quot;Snowy&quot; Justice who had been a Kangaroo tourist alongside Kadwell in 1929–30 and who took over as captain when Kadwell&#x27;s 1932 season was ended with a broken leg. Justice would play eleven seasons with the club, followed by a long post-playing career with as Football Club secretary and League&#x27;s Club secretary-manager through till the early 1970s.

In 1933 St George sneaked into the semifinals in fourth place and won their way into the final against minor premiers Newtown. They lost 18–5. That same year they won the first night competition conducted by the NSWRL, a six-club competition played on three Saturday nights at the Sydney Showground.

In 1935 St George defeated Canterbury-Bankstown 91–6, the biggest win in their history and still the biggest winning margin ever in the history of the League; every player scored during this match. In 1937 for the fourth time in the club&#x27;s short history, the Dragon Slayers finished as competition runners-up. Their inaugural premiership had still not been achieved when at the end of the decade, following the 1939 season, the club moved its home ground back to Hurstville Oval. Former Lord Mayor of Sydney, Jack Mostyn became President of the club in 1937 and retained the role for the next eight years. In 1938, Clarrie Fahy became St. George&#x27;s third secretary after the retirement of Reg Fusedale. Fahy remained as Club Secretary until 1944.
===1940s===
The long wait finally ended in 1941 when St George defeated Eastern Suburbs 31–14 at the Sydney Cricket Ground to take their inaugural First Grade premiership. They were captain-coached by Neville Smith. Brothers Jack and Herb Gilbert Jr., the sons of the club&#x27;s first captain-coach Herb Gilbert both played in the match. The following year, 1942 all three grades reached the Grand final with the 3rd-grade side victorious. The first-grade side had routed Canterbury-Bankstown, the minor premiers, in a semi-final and then beat Easts in the final but as had happened in 1930, Canterbury exercised their right as minor premiers to issue a challenge and beat Saints in a Grand final. For season 1945, St. George obtained the services of a south sea islander called Walter Mussing. A prolific try scorer, Mussing was the top try scorer for the club in 1945 and was a crowd favourite for three seasons.

St George captained by Herb Narvo and starring the backline brothers Jack and Ray Lindwall were runners up again in 1946 losing to Balmain 12–13. Ray Lindwall missed four conversion attempts that day.

During the famous tour by the 1946 Great Britain team, Frank Whitcombe&#x27;s performances on tour attracted the attention of St. George. Club official Jack Mogridge offered Whitcombe a two-year contract at £600 per season as player-coach plus costs of transport and a lucrative job, (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £59,340 in 2016). Whitcombe signed the two-year contract with St George, however on his return to Bradford the family decided to stay in Yorkshire.

In the 1949 NSWRFL season they were premiers for the second time, beating South Sydney 19–12 in a spirited win. They were captained by the Test five-eighth Johnny Hawke with Frank Facer as Vice Captain and contained a champion backline including Noel Pidding, Doug McRitchie, Matt McCoy and Ron Roberts.The Dragons had lost form in the back-end of the season but came home strongly beating minor premiers South Sydney in the semi, and Balmain in a final before meeting Souths again in the Grand final.

Some first grade players killed in World War 2 include Jack Lennox, Len Brennan, Jack Simpson and Spencer Walklate.

===1950s===

The St George Football Club came of age in the 1950s. A move from Hurstville Oval to Kogarah Oval saw St George take on Souths before a crowd of 12,500 fans in their inaugural match at the ground. Due to its close proximity to Kogarah Oval, the Carlton Hotel became the local watering hole for the players after training.

In 1953 the first St George Leagues Club was built on the corner of Princes Highway &amp; Rocky Point Road. The building later became a High School, although the building was demolished in July 2015. This club was to become the site of many victory celebrations over the next 10 years. In 1956 St George began their reign as Premiers beating Balmain 18–12 in the decider. In the following year, they won in First grade, 3rd Grade and the Presidents Cup while being runners-up in Reserve grade. Their dominance had commenced and would last until 1966, covering an unprecedented 11 victories. In the early years players such as Kearney, Wilson, Clay, Provan, Lumsden and Bath forged the club&#x27;s success. In 1959 they went through the season undefeated amassing 550 points (205 scored by Harry Bath) compared to their rivals total tally against them of just 90 points. That year the brilliant young lock Johnny Raper made his grand final debut at centre replacing the injured Reg Gasnier.
The writers Collis &amp; Whitaker, Larry Writer and Heads &amp; Middleton have all attributed the reign of success to three key factors:,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heads/Middleton p 344&quot;&gt;Heads/Middleton p 344&lt;/ref&gt;
# Club administration – the run began the same year that Frank Facer came to power as the football club Secretary. Facer had an eye for talent, was a shrewd negotiator and along with President Len Kelly and Directors Alex Mackie, Glynn Price and Laurie Doust, the leadership group planned their recruitment policy to cover team gaps well ahead of time and worked to maintain an attractive family atmosphere and an environment that fostered success.
# Club funds – the successful Leagues Club generated revenue from poker machines and liquor sales and enabled funds to be poured into local talent development but also enabled star local and overseas players to be lured to the club to share in its success.
# Mastering the art of unlimited tackle football – firstly Ken Kearney and then Harry Bath came to the club after successful careers in English rugby league and brought with them the disciplines of resolute defence, superior ball skills and an uncompromising commitment to fitness. The Dragons&#x27; stone-wall defence and controlled and punishing forward play became renowned and resulted in statistics such as the 1959 side remaining unbeaten throughout the season (snatching 19 wins and a draw against Western Suburbs); being undefeated at their Jubilee Oval home ground in twelve seasons from 1954 to end 1965; while in the total eleven premiership deciding Grand finals played, the Dragons conceded just five tries.

===1960s===

By the early 1960s St George players were afforded movie star status in Sydney and names such as Reg Gasnier and Johnny Raper were highly familiar as were later those of Graeme Langlands, Billy Smith and Johnny King.
1963 was a particularly notable year for the club. A new Leagues Club was opened on the Princes Highway at Carlton, and would become the hub of social life in the district and dubbed &quot;the Taj Mahal&quot;. On the afternoon of 24 August 1963 Saints won the Grand Final in all three grades
(First Grade 8–3 v Wests; Reserves 3-2 v Souths; 3rd Grade 12–2 v Canterbury) – this feat has not been achieved since. That same day saw the creation of an iconic image when Sydney Morning Herald photographer John O&#x27;Gready captured a photo which would become titled &quot;The Gladiators&quot; and which showed the essence of good sportsmanship as the Saints&#x27; captain Norm Provan and West&#x27;s captain Arthur Summons embraced post-match in exhausted camaraderie while barely recognisable, covered head-to-toe in mud. Reserve try scorer was R O&#x27;Loughlin.

In 1965 another record was set when a crowd of 78,056 football supporters packed the SCG to see the Dragons triumph over Souths, and the tally reached ten consecutive premierships in Norm Provan&#x27;s farewell match. Provan wrote the introduction to the Haddan book &quot;The Finals – 100 Years&quot; and reflected upon the dressing room mood before the match:
On 18 September 1966, under new captain Ian Walsh, St George won their world-record 11th straight premiership, defeating Balmain 23–4.
The end of the reign came in a year which marked the retirement of one of their greatest stars in Reg Gasnier but which also marked the first season played under the limited tackle rule, replacing the previous era (since the code&#x27;s 1908 inception) of unlimited tackles. Fitting perhaps in that the club&#x27;s stronghold had been built on the back of a 1950s style of punishing forward dominance. The end came at the hands of Canterbury-Bankstown who beat St George in the 1967 preliminary final. That year&#x27;s title, however, would go to the tough South Sydney campaigners many of whom had been on the losing end of the 1965 Grand final against the Dragons but who learnt from their experience and who would go on themselves to their enjoy own brief golden period making five successive grand finals from 1967–1971, winning four.

===1970s===
While shaded by the spectacular success of the previous decade, the Dragons remained competitive throughout most of the 1970s winning premierships in 1977 and 1979, being runner-up Grand Finalists in 1971 and 1975 and finishing the regular season in 3rd place or better in all years excepting 1974 and 1978. In the late 60s and into the early 70s St George got their best value out of Billy Smith and Graeme Langlands after all the other stars of the long reign had gone. It was largely due to their combined class and the apparent on-field intuitive understanding of each other&#x27;s kicking and positional game that the club showed consistency of form through to the mid-1970s.

During 1970, St George became the first club in any code of Football to provide three Kangaroo Captains in the same season in Graeme Langlands, Billy Smith and rugby-union convert Phil Hawthorne. Other stars in the early 1970s were Barry Beath, Ken Maddison, Rod Reddy, Steve Edge and Ted Goodwin.

In 1971 St George made it through to the Grand final against an experienced Souths side with a battle-hardened pack. Saints were the underdogs but looked well-positioned when the half-time score was 1–0. Souths then raced ahead in the second half to 11–0 lead. The Dragons fought back with tries to Barry Beath and Ted Walton, while Langlands converted both including a magnificent sideline kick giving the Saints fans great hope of an upset. However a match-winning try from Souths&#x27; Bob McCarthy showed the experience of the Rabbitohs and South Sydney took their fourth title in a five-year period.

A year of injuries in 1974 saw St George win only ten of the season&#x27;s twenty-two matches and miss the semi-finals for the first time in 23 years. In 1975 Langlands wore white boots, novel at the time, in the Grand final against Easts. Langlands had problems with a groin injury and, partially because he battled-on relying strongly on painkillers, St George was defeated 38–0. This was a record loss in a Grand Final until 2008 when Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles defeated Melbourne Storm 40–0 however that was accumulated on the four-point try system. The 1975 score on that basis would be 46-0.

In the latter half of the decade Steve Edge, Rocket Reddy, Steve Morris, Mark Shulman, Robert Stone, Bruce Starkey, John Jansen and Craig Young provided the playing leadership at the club. In 1977, enjoying a resurgence under new coach Harry Bath, St George met Parramatta in a thrilling Grand Final, which went into 20 minutes of extra time. Reddy ever the enforcer in his career, had played a brutal defensive first half resulting in post-match comments that Parramatta&#x27;s Ray Price finished the game looking like he&#x27;d been used as a punching bag.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collis/Whitaker p 150&quot;&gt;Collis/Whitaker p 150&lt;/ref&gt; Reddy&#x27;s questionable tactics, targeting Price and Higgs in the 2nd half saw a number of penalties with successful goal results go Parramatta&#x27;s way. A try with ten minutes to run saw the Eels tie up the match and in spite of missed goal attempts by both kickers and some desperate field-goal shots from the Dragons, the match finished at 9–9 with tension high amongst players, officials and supporters. It was the first time Australian rugby league had experienced a drawn Grand final and a rematch was scheduled for the next week. In the rematch St George proved too strong, defeating Parramatta 22–0. It was a fitting farewell for the stalwart Dragons second rower Barry Beath, the last Dragon to retire who&#x27;d been involved as a player in the eleven-year run. Beath is credited with the unusual statistic of winning a premiership in his first season (1966) and his last (1977), but none in ten seasons between.

Administratively, 1977 was the Saints&#x27; best-ever year financially. The crowd average was over 19,000 enabling funds for Kogarah Oval to be updated. The following year Frank Facer, the football club Secretary who had masterminded the successes of the 1950s and 1960s died of cancer. It was Facer who brought Harry Bath back to the club in 1977. Bath had coached Balmain and Newtown and had success as the national coach and Facer&#x27;s masterstroke in bringing Bath back into the Dragons&#x27; fold paid off, enabling the old campaigner &quot;Fearless Frank&quot; to see one last premiership victory before his death.

In the 1979 season, still under Bath, Saints got back into the swing of things and won the Grand Final against Canterbury 17–13. By now Edge and Young were experienced leaders and Reddy, as he&#x27;d done in the 1st 1977 Grand final, came into his own in the 1979 decider punishing the opposition forwards with his ruthless defence. As it turned out this would be the last premiership St George would win in first grade before the merger in 1999.

===1980s===
Harry Bath coached the 1980 and 1981 seasons, then from 1982 to 1987 the Dragons were coached by the articulate and tactically brilliant Roy Masters. Though he had not himself played the game at the top level he had a keen interest in team psychology and had achieved excellent results at Wests from 1978–81 and helped that struggling club to produce consistent on-field results. Under Masters, in 1985 St George were minor-premiers, runaway club champions and made it to the Grand final in all three Grades. After winning both the lower grades, the Dragons first grade team were beaten by Canterbury 7–6. At the end of this year, plans to build a new stand were deferred. A decision to move from Kogarah to the SCG had supporters and even some officials disheartened.

In 1986, with the SCG as their new home ground, St George missed the semi-finals in all three grades for the first time in 50 years. A decision was made at the end of 1987 to move St George from the SCG to the Belmore Sports Ground in 1988 with the hope of returning to Jubilee Oval Kogarah at a later stage.

Ted Glossop coached for a single season in 1988, tasting success when the Dragons won the mid-week 1988 Panasonic Cup competition. In front of 22,000 spectators at Parramatta Stadium, with millions more watching the game on television, the Dragons defeated the Balmain Tigers 16–8 with prizemoney totalling $150,000. Tries were scored by Ricky Walford, Steve Robinson and an unforgettable intercept try by Bert Gordon that &quot;brought the house down&quot;. Later, lock forward Peter Gill was awarded the Panasonic Cup &quot;Player of the Series&quot; for 1988.

In 1989, former premiership winning captain Craig Young had two seasons at the helm (1989 &amp; 1990) but left under unhappy circumstances. In 1989, Saints appointed former player Geoff Carr as secretary of club and also returned home to upgraded facilities at Kogarah Jubilee Oval but the season would end and along with it the first decade since the 1930s in which the club failed to win a premiership.

===1990s===
The &#x27;90s saw St George on a roller-coaster ride. Between 1991 and 1995, St George played one home game per year at the Adelaide Oval in South Australia in a deal with longtime major sponsor, the Adelaide based Penfolds Winery. The first game in the &quot;City of Churches&quot; in 1991 saw the Dragons defeat Balmain 16-2 in front of 28,884 fans which was in fact the NSWRL&#x27;s highest non-finals attendance for the season. Saints would go on to host Brisbane (1992, L 18-20), Canberra (1993, L 2-30), Wests (1994, W 32-16), and finally Newcastle (1995, L 13-24). In total the Dragons attracted 89,883 fans to their five home games in Adelaide. St. George would play one more game in Adelaide when they played the short-lived Adelaide Rams at the famous oval in 1998, losing a close encounter 20-22 in front of 8,506 fans. In a podcast with former NRL star Denan Kemp in 2023, former St George forward Gorden Tallis revealed the club almost moved to Adelaide in 1996 at the height of the Super League war to maintain their sponsorship with Penfolds and play as the St George Adelaide Dragons.

Saints made the Grand Final in 1992, 1993 and 1996, but were unable to win the premiership. In 1992 and 1993, coached by the former Illawarra Steelers coach Brian Smith, the Dragons met the Brisbane Broncos in successive deciders. On the first occasion St George were captained by centre Michael Beattie, but Brisbane was too classy, running away with the game in the 2nd half to win 28–8, including a 95-metre try to Broncos centre Steve Renouf in which he just outpaced Ricky Walford to score.

Twelve months later in 1993, there were high expectations for the Dragons having comfortably accounted for Canberra 31–10 and Canterbury 27–12 in the semi-finals, and with the Broncos having scraped into the finals in fifth place. The sides for the grand final replay were largely unchanged between the two years. Only one Bronco (Peter Ryan), and four of the Dragons (Jason Stevens, Nathan Brown, Gorden Tallis and Phil Blake) had not played in the 1992 Grand Final. forward Steven&#x27;s game turned sour in only the second tackle of the game when he suffered a thumb injury that required him leaving the field and being taken to hospital for surgery. Brisbane withstood an early Dragons barrage which brought much hope but no points. Then two tries to Brisbane sent them to the break with a 10–2. Saints winger Ian &quot;Chook&quot; Herron kept the Dragons in touch with three penalty goals to make it 10–6, but the title stayed north of the border when Broncos winger Willie Carne scored two minutes from full-time.

In 1995, after exploring the possibility of a merger with the Roosters in an attempt to match the turnover of the all-conquering Brisbane Broncos, chief executive Geoff Carr was sacked by his board.

St George played in their last Grand Final as a single club when they faced off against Manly-Warringah in the 1996 decider, with the Sea Eagles winning 20-8 in front of 40,985 fans at the Sydney Football Stadium. The David Waite coached Dragons had finished the season in 7th position and won their way through to the Grand Final with wins over Canberra (16-14), Sydney City (36-16), and North Sydney (29-12) in the semi-finals. St George&#x27;s last Grand Final captain was Queensland State of Origin and Australian test centre Mark Coyne.

The Dragons&#x27; first points of the Grand Final came in the 37th minute when Wayne Bartrim kicked a penalty awarded after Manly forward Owen Cunningham was penalised for stripping the ball. From the ensuing kick-off just before half-time came the game&#x27;s controversial moment and a hotly disputed try. Manly fullback Matthew Ridge made a spectacular short kick-off and regathered, catching the Dragons unaware. St George hooker Nathan Brown appeared to tackle Ridge, albeit one-handedly and by the collar. Ridge got up and ran when Brown and the rest of the Dragons were expecting him to stop and play the ball. Referee David Manson ruled that Brown had not completed the tackle. This caught the Dragons napping and Ridge was eventually tackled just a few metres from the line. Manly back-rower Steve Menzies then broke his way through Saints&#x27; defence to score next to the posts, giving Ridge an easy conversion kick. The controversial ruling by referee Manson gave Manly a 14–2 half time lead.

At the conclusion of the 1998 season, the formation of the competition&#x27;s first joint venture team occurred when St George joint ventured with the Illawarra Steelers to form the St George Illawarra Dragons.

===Post joint-venture===

The joint venture first fielded a side in the NRL competition in 1999 and reached the Grand final that year. They would later win its first premiership as a joint venture in 2010, and in 2018 a women&#x27;s side operating under the same club name was formed ahead of the inaugural NRL Women&#x27;s Premiership commencing the same year.

St. George fielded a NSW Cup team from 1921-2000, before forming a St. George Illawarra side which lasted from 2001 to 2007. The Dragons still field stand alone sides in the SG Ball and Harold Matthews competitions, last winning an SG Ball title in 1992 and have yet to taste premiership success in the under 16s Harold Mathews Cup. In 2018, the Dragons entered the Tarsha Gale Cup, a women&#x27;s Under 18&#x27;s competition, for the first time.

==Stadium==
St. George began their home-ground stadium at Hurstville Oval in 1921 until 1924. In 1925, they went to Earl Park, Arncliffe, where they remained until 1939. They returned to Hurstville in 1940, where they remained until 1949.

In 1950, the team moved to Kogarah Oval. They stayed at the venue until 1985. From 1986 until 1988 while the ground was being renovated, the Dragons moved to Sydney Cricket Ground (1986–1987) and to Belmore Oval (1988). In 1989, the team returned to Kogarah Oval where they remained until the joint-venture with the Illawarra Steelers at the end of the 1998 NRL season.

St. George&#x27;s home game crowd record was in 1975, where a crowd of 23,582 attended the game against South Sydney at Kogarah Oval.

Presently, the St. George Dragons play the bulk of home games in the SG Ball and Harold Matthews competitions at WIN Jubilee Oval, and in recent years have also hosted games at Hurstville Oval.

<text>The House of Mystery is the name of several horror, fantasy, and mystery comics anthologies published by DC Comics. It had a companion series, &quot;The House of Secrets&quot;. It is also the name of the titular setting of the series.

==First series==
===Genesis===
&quot;The House of Mystery&quot; began as a horror anthology, featuring tales of the supernatural as well as supernatural-themed mystery stories. Issue #1 was cover dated December 1950-January 1951. With the growing backlash against American horror comics in the mid-1950s, as well as the advent of the Comics Code Authority and its restrictions on horror-themed storylines (banning stories dealing with such supernatural fare as vampires and werewolves), the series was quietly revamped into dealing with science fiction-type monsters and other mystery/suspense-type tales that were permitted by the Comics Code.

===Superheroes===
In the mid-1960s, the series was revamped to include superhero stories. From &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; #143 (June 1964) to 155 (December 1966), &quot;J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz, the Manhunter from Mars&quot; headlined the book, as his back-up feature from &quot;Detective Comics&quot; was moved to &quot;The House of Mystery&quot;. This was followed with the introduction of &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot; in issue #156 (January 1966), which took over as headliner until issue #173 (March–April 1968). The Martian Manhunter was again relegated to back-up status during this time.

===Return of horror===
With issue #174, EC Comics veteran Joe Orlando was hired by DC to take over as editor of &quot;The House of Mystery&quot;. As the Comics Code Authority was now being challenged by both DC and Marvel over content restrictions, the series returned to its overt horror themes. The first issue under Orlando would be a reprint issue of old horror/suspense stories, as the new direction would truly begin with #175 (July–August 1968). The issue would introduce a new figure to the series, Cain, the &quot;able care taker&quot; of the House of Mystery who would introduce nearly all stories that would run in the series before its cancellation. Cain would also host the spin-off humor series &quot;Plop!&quot; and later become a recurring character in &quot;Blue Devil&quot; and &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

Artist Bernie Wrightson&#x27;s first professional comic work was the story &quot;The Man Who Murdered Himself&quot; which appeared in issue #179 (March–April 1969).

Under Orlando&#x27;s stewardship, the series won a good deal of recognition in the comics industry, including the &quot;Shazam Award for Best Individual Short Story (Dramatic)&quot; in 1972 for &quot;The Demon Within&quot; in issue #201 by John Albano and Jim Aparo, and the &quot;Shazam Award for Best Humor Story&quot; in 1972 for &quot;The Poster Plague&quot; by Steve Skeates and Sergio Aragonés. &quot;Limited Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-23 (Winter 1973) featured reprints of &quot;House of Mystery&quot; stories. &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #224 (April–May 1974) to 229 (Feb.–March 1975) were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format.

The series was in the Dollar Comics format for issues #251 (March–April 1977) to 259 (July–August 1978). &quot;House of Mystery&quot; featured stories by writers T. Casey Brennan (issues #260, 267, 268 and 274) and Scott Edelman (issues #257, 258, 260, 264, 266, 270, 272, 273). Orlando&#x27;s tenure as editor ended with issue #257 (March–April 1978). Karen Berger became editor of the series with issue #292 (May 1981), her first for DC Comics. Under Berger, the series experimented with long-form storylines in the popular &quot;I...Vampire&quot; serial created by writer J. M. DeMatteis. &quot;I... Vampire&quot; revolved around the heroic vampire, Andrew Bennett, who sought to defeat his nemesis and former lover Mary Seward, the Queen of Blood. This serial began in issue #290 (March 1981) and would last until issue #319 (August 1983), two issues before the title ended with issue #321 (October 1983).

Since 2006, DC Comics has reprinted stories from the original run: three black and white &quot;Showcase Presents&quot; volumes have been published, reprinting the series from #174 - 194, #195 - 211 and #212 - 226, respectively. A one-shot reprint in color, &quot;Welcome Back to the House of Mystery&quot;, featured 10 of the most highly regarded stories as selected by Alisa Kwitney in a Cain wraparound by Neil Gaiman and Sergio Aragonés under the Vertigo Comics imprint. The first issue from 1951 was reissued as a &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; bearing the Vertigo imprint.

==&quot;Elvira&#x27;s House of Mystery&quot;==
In 1986–1987, DC comics published a new series, &quot;Elvira&#x27;s House of Mystery&quot;. It lasted 11 issues, plus a special Christmas issue. The series was a quasi-follow-up of the original series, with famed horror movie hostess Elvira, Mistress of the Dark tasked by the House with finding Cain, though she spent much of her time making fun of him and introducing horror stories similar to the original series. One issue of this series, issue #3, was released without Comics Code Approval and contained significant implied nudity, but subsequent editorial comments in later issues stated that the experiment in releasing an unapproved issue was not considered successful.

==2008 series==

DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint began a new ongoing series in May 2008, written by Lilah Sturges and Bill Willingham. It features at least one different story each issue, told by people trapped in a &quot;purgatory-like house&quot;. The series ended in October 2011 with issue #42. Two &quot;Annual&quot;s were also published.

==The House==
The House of Mystery exists north of Louisville, Kentucky, where it was built and abandoned by Colonel Braitwaithe before the American Civil War, and in the Dreaming. Little is known about the House of Mystery in general. Its exterior and interior change periodically, meaning that one never enters the same room twice. The House of Mystery lies in the same graveyard as the House of Secrets, its companion. Cain lives in the House of Mystery, whereas Abel resides in the House of Secrets.

Cain is not the only person to have resided within the House; in addition to boarders, including Mister Mxyzptlk, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark took shelter within the House. Her brief stay in the House of Mystery is notable for two reasons: first, the House of Mystery is established as being the same House throughout its publication history. Three distinct personalities of the House are shown: the original horror House of Mystery, a dark humor &quot;House of Weirdness&quot;-style which harkened back to Cain&#x27;s stint in &quot;Plop!&quot;, and the current version of the House of Mystery in Kentucky. The second reason is the timing of Elvira&#x27;s stay. She took up residence during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Elvira, tasked by the House of Mystery to find Cain, took over his role of host for a brief period, while Cain was relegated to being the butt of her jokes during occasional cameos.

The House of Mystery possesses sentience, along with mystic powers. It has possessed someone before and merged with the House of Secrets briefly. It was destroyed in &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; #321 before being restored during &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

Batman entered the house in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #93, tripped on a floorboard, and would have been shot had his pursuer&#x27;s gun not jammed. He never actually met Cain, who instead narrates a story about him occurring in Scotland, which climaxes in a castle he describes as &quot;a house of mystery&quot; rather than &quot;the House of Mystery&quot;. Superman teamed with Cain against Mxyzptlk, who was attempting to take over the House, in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #53.

The House of Mystery appears mainly in various Vertigo titles, especially those tied into Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot;; it has appeared briefly in &quot;Resurrection Man&quot;. Something called the House of Mystery appeared in &quot;52&quot; #18, where it seems to have been used for some time as a base for a team of detectives called the Croatoan Society, which counts both Detective Chimp and Ralph Dibny among its members. It is unclear if the Croatoan&#x27;s House of Mystery is meant to be the same as the original House of Mystery, a post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; version of the original House of Mystery, or simply a different location with the same name. Cain&#x27;s name appeared on this house&#x27;s mailbox, implying a connection to the original House.

In &quot;The New 52&quot;&#x27;s rebooted DC continuity (launched in 2011), the House reappeared in the pages of &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, being used as a base for the team. The House is shown to currently belong to John Constantine, who claims to have won the key to the House in a poker game against Doctor Occult and Father Time. Constantine takes his time to adjust to the House of Mystery due to the changing rooms and feels that the House has to play tricks on those who enter it.

<text>The House of Secrets is the name of several mystery, fantasy, and horror comics anthologies published by DC Comics. It is notable for being the title that introduced the character the Swamp Thing. It had a companion series titled &quot;The House of Mystery&quot;.

==Publication history ==
=== First series ===
The original Silver Age series ran 80 issues, from November/December 1956 to September/October 1966. In addition to short &quot;one-off&quot; stories, several issues featured the adventures of modern-dress sorcerer Mark Merlin, who first appeared in issue #23 (August 1959). The dual-personality supervillain Eclipso (&quot;Hero and Villain in One Man!&quot;) was created by Bob Haney and Lee Elias and was introduced in issue #61 (August 1963) and continued to the series&#x27; end. Prince Ra-Man the Mind-Master bowed in #73 (July - August 1965) and was a Doctor Strange-style &quot;replacement&quot; for Mark Merlin. Prince Ra-Man twice battled Eclipso. The &quot;Prince Ra-Man&quot; feature ended in &quot;House of Secrets&quot; #80 (September - October 1966), the final issue of the series. Other, lesser continuing features included &quot;Peter Puptent, Explorer&quot;; &quot;Dolly and the Professor&quot;; &quot;Doctor Rocket&quot;; and &quot;Moolah the Mystic&quot;.

=== Revival (second run) ===
The series was revived three years later with a definite article as &quot;The House of Secrets&quot;, beginning with issue #81 (August - Sept. 1969). Now its horror and suspense tales were introduced by a host named Abel, who would also host the satirical comic &quot;Plop!&quot;. His brother, Cain, hosted &quot;The House of Mystery&quot;.

The title had an early breakthrough for the mainstream part of the medium: issue #83 had a story, &quot;The Stuff that Dreams are Made of&quot;, written by Marv Wolfman. As part of the framing story, Abel introduces the story by telling a tale told to him by a &quot;wandering Wolfman&quot;. Upon examination, the censor bureau, the Comics Code Authority refused to give the issue its seal of approval since it mentions a wolfman, which was specifically forbidden along with other classic monsters. Editor Gerry Conway explained that the term referred to Marv Wolfman, and the CCA conceded on the condition that the distinction be made obvious with a writer&#x27;s credit in the story. That directive was complied with and suddenly the editorship of DC was inundated with complaints from other writers because of Wolfman&#x27;s special consideration of a printed credit. In response, the editorship made writers credits standard practice for future publications.

Swamp Thing first appeared in &quot;The House of Secrets&quot; #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone story written by Len Wein and drawn by Bernie Wrightson. The woman appearing on the cover of this issue was modeled after future comics writer Louise Simonson. The Patchwork Man, a character from the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; ongoing series, was intended to be an ongoing feature, but only appeared in one issue.

The revival of &quot;The House of Secrets&quot;, sporting many covers by Neal Adams, Bernie Wrightson and Michael Kaluta, ran through issue #154 (Nov. 1978), with six months passing between issues #140 (February - March 1976) and 141 (August - September 1976). Cancelled as a result of the DC Implosion, it was then &quot;merged&quot; into &quot;The Unexpected&quot; with issue #189 through issue #199. The series was 68 ad-free pages, allowing all three portions to be full-length issues.

The House of Secrets also came to be the name of the actual edifice in which Abel lives. Writer Mike Friedrich and artist Jerry Grandenetti introduced the house and explained its origins. The building itself was constructed for a Senator Sanderson using only materials from Kentucky, and went under the enchantment that only pure-blood Kentuckians would be able to live there. Later, Sanderson&#x27;s wife went insane in the upper floors, leading the Senator to sell the house. The next four owners, none of them pure Kentuckians, found themselves driven away for various reasons. The following owner attempted to move the home from its original location, but the house tore itself free from its trailer, ran its owner over a cliff to his death and settled less than 200 yards from the Kentucky state line in a graveyard. Whether by fate or some mystical alignment, the companion House of Mystery stands at the other end of the graveyard. Shortly after this, Abel was driven to the house and entrusted as its caretaker by a man who revealed himself to be an aspect of the House&#x27;s existence, but making vague references to an employer. Abel was showing living in the House of Mystery in the quarterly &quot;DC Special&quot; #4, published one month earlier (July - Sept. 1969).

In the 1980s and 1990s, &quot;The Sandman&quot; series revealed that the House of Secrets edifice exists both in the real world of the DC Universe and in the Dreaming, as a repository for secrets of all kinds. The character of Abel would later become a recurring character in &quot;The Sandman&quot; (vol. 2) and related series such as &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.

=== Second series ===

DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint revived the name &quot;House of Secrets&quot; as a new title and concept. Here the House of Secrets was a mobile manor, appearing in different places. The building itself is haunted by the Juris, a group of ghosts who summon those with secrets in order to judge them and pass sentence. To the Juris, all offenses carry the same weight, from rape and murder to simply lying at a crucial moment. A runaway named Rain Harper stumbled upon the House of Secrets and took up a position as an unwilling witness to the Juris trials, validating the judgments and either condemning the tried souls to imprisonment in the basement, or setting them free to live their life purged of their secret.

Starting fresh with a new #1 (October 1996), this series ran 25 issues, plus a two-part special &quot;House of Secrets: Facade&quot;. This &quot;House of Secrets&quot; series was creator-owned, except for its title which was &quot;licensed&quot; by DC to the series&#x27; creators. The letters column in issue #6 indicates that, for legal reasons, they could not include Cain and Abel in the stories. This series was used for the framing story in the first Vertigo &quot;Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot; special, featuring Rain happening upon an art gallery in the House whose paintings allow her to see stories from &quot;The Sandman&quot; (vol. 2), &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, &quot;John Constantine, Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, &quot;The Minx&quot;, &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot; and &quot;Nevada&quot;.

== Secret Six headquarters ==
In the mid-2000s, the Secret Six made their headquarters in the House of Secrets. Scandal stated in issue #5 of &quot;Villains United&quot; that the House would not show up on technological scans or mystical surveillance. She also said that Mockingbird claimed the House was a &quot;house of victims&quot;.

==In other media==
The House of Secrets appears in the &quot;Young Justice&quot; episode &quot;Secrets&quot;. This version is a magic shop across the street from the house of Greta and Billy Hayes.

<doc id="853097" wikidata="Q4586465" url="?curid=853097" title="1990s United Kingdom local government reform">
<text>The structure of local government in the United Kingdom underwent large changes in the 1990s. The system of two-tier local government introduced in the 1970s by the Local Government Act 1972 and the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 was abolished in Scotland and Wales on 1 April 1996 and replaced with single-tier authorities. In England, some areas remained two-tier but many single-tier authorities (designated as Unitary Authorities in England) were created. No changes were made to local government in Northern Ireland.

==Background==
Prior to the 1970s, the UK had had a mixed system of local government, with some areas being covered by a county council and a more local district council, while large towns had only a single tier of authority (in England and Wales these were termed county boroughs, and in Scotland &#x27;counties of cities&#x27;). The Acts abolished the existing county boroughs or counties of cities, and created a uniform two-tier system of government with regions or counties, and districts.

In 1986, Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government abolished the county councils of the six metropolitan counties that had been created in 1974, along with the Greater London Council, effectively creating 68 new single-tier authorities: 32 London boroughs and 36 metropolitan boroughs.

In 1990, Thatcher&#x27;s government introduced the Community Charge, popularly known as the Poll Tax, a new way of funding local councils based on a fixed per-head fee. This proved very unpopular, and led to riots. Eventually, Thatcher was ousted by her own party, and the new Conservative leader and Prime Minister, John Major, pledged to abolish the Community Charge.

Legislation for the Council Tax was introduced and passed in the 1991/1992 session. Also at this time the government took the opportunity to review the structure of local government throughout Great Britain.

==England==
The Local Government Commission for England was established under the Local Government Act 1992, allowing the Secretary of State to order the commission to undertake &#x27;structural reviews&#x27; in specified areas, to create unitary authorities in the two-tier shire counties. After much political debate, the commission&#x27;s proposals resulted in:
*The abolition of the counties of Avon, Cleveland, Hereford and Worcester and Humberside, created in 1974
*The replacement of the county council of Berkshire with six unitary authorities
*New unitary authorities covering many of the larger urban districts of England.

==Scotland==
The previous system in Scotland had been the regions and districts. These were quite unbalanced in terms of population – the Strathclyde region had nineteen districts and over two million people, whereas the Borders region had four districts and only 100,000 people.

The Act established 29 new &#x27;council areas&#x27;, and retained the three Island Councils. Variance in population was much less in the council areas, with just over half a million in the largest council area, Glasgow City, compared to 50,000 in the smallest on the mainland, Clackmannanshire. These are however outliers, and only six are outside the range 75,000 to 250,000.

In some cases the names of traditional counties were revived as administrative areas, although often with vastly different borders.

==Wales==

In Wales the existing system was replaced with a new single-tier system, of counties and county boroughs, the only difference between them now being the name (and the councils of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport are styled as cities).

The 1974 reform in Wales had abandoned use of the names of the historic counties of Wales as local government areas. This was partially reversed in 1996, with Anglesey, Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Monmouthshire and Pembrokeshire all reappearing as local government areas, although not necessarily with their traditional borders.

The names and areas of the administrative counties abolished in 1996 remained in use (with modifications) as the preserved counties of Wales for purposes such as Lieutenancy.

<text>The Brisbane Transit Centre, at 151–171 Roma Street, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, was a long-distance bus station. It was closed and demolished in 2020 along with its three office towers. It was commonly regarded as the ugliest building in Brisbane.

== History ==
Opened in 1986, the Brisbane Transit Centre was between the Queensland Police Service headquarters and the Roma Street Parkland. The complex included a number of shops, cafes and restaurants, and two office towers. It also included the Travelodge Hotel which was positioned above the station, which opened in 1986. Access to the centre was from the ground floor on Roma Street or from the Roma Street Parkland. In March 2016, GPT sold its half share in the property to co-owner the Australian Prime Property Fund.

==Long distance coach travel==
The coach terminal was located on the top floor of the Brisbane Transit Centre and used by:
*Crisps Coaches to Tenterfield and Moree
*Greyhound Australia intrastate within Queensland and interstate services to Byron Bay and Sydney
*Murrays to Toowoomba and Chinchilla
*NSW TrainLink to Casino, connecting with train services to Sydney
*Premier Motor Service to Cairns, Lismore and Sydney
*Bus Queensland to Mount Isa and Charleville

==Train travel==
Roma Street railway station was accessed from the ground floor level of the Brisbane Transit Centre. Long distance Traveltrain services depart for destinations within Queensland. NSW TrainLink operate an XPT service to Sydney. It is also part of the Queensland Rail City network.

==Translink buses==
Roma Street busway station is served by Transport for Brisbane buses.

==Demolition==
The Cross River Rail Authority demolished the whole of the Brisbane Transit Centre including the East and West Tower and Hotel Jen from March 2018 to make way for Cross River Rail platforms at Roma Street. The Brisbane Coach Terminal opened to the north of Roma Street station as a replacement.

<doc id="853100" wikidata="Q15622229" url="?curid=853100" title="Patrimonialism">
<text>Patrimonialism is a form of governance in which all power flows directly from the ruler. There is no distinction between the public and private domains. These regimes are autocratic and exclude the lower, middle and upper classes from power. The leaders of these countries typically enjoy absolute personal power. Usually, the armies of these countries are loyal to the leader, not the state. In a patrimonial monarchy, the ruler&#x27;s power is fundamentally based on the ownership of a majority of the country&#x27;s territory as private property. This ownership allows the ruler to generate income from the land, which can be used to support the royal court, maintain an army, and exert immense political influence and authority. Power is centralized, and the monarch exercises direct control and ownership over the majority of the territory, resources, and institutions.

This contrasts sharply with feudal monarchies, where the vast majority of the lands are owned by vassals, where the power is decentralized and shared with vassals who govern their own fiefdoms in exchange for loyalty and military service.

==Descriptions by scholars==
=== Max Weber ===

Julia Adams states: &quot;In Weber&#x27;s &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, patrimonialism mainly refers to forms of government that are based on rulers&#x27; family-households. The ruler&#x27;s authority is personal-familial, and the mechanics of the household are the model for political administration. The concept of patrimonialism captures a distinctive style of regulation and administration that contrasts with Weber&#x27;s ideal-typical rational-legal bureaucracy&quot;. She states that Weber has used patrimonialism to describe, among other systems, &quot;estatist and absolutist politics of early modern Europe&quot;. For Weber, patriarchy is at the centre of patrimonalism and is its model and origin.

===Nathan Quimpo===
Nathan Quimpo defines patrimonialism as &quot;a type of rule in which the ruler does not distinguish between personal and public patrimony and treats matters and resources of state as his personal affair.&quot;

===Richard Pipes===
Richard Pipes, a historian and Professor Emeritus of Russian history at Harvard University defines patrimonial as &quot;a regime where the rights of sovereignty and those of ownership blend to the point of being indistinguishable, and political power is exercised in the same manner as economic power.&quot;

=== J. I. Bakker ===
J. I. Bakker, a sociologist at the University of Guelph, states:

=== Francis Fukuyama ===
In his &quot;The Origins of Political Order&quot;, Francis Fukuyama states on the matter: &quot;Natural human sociability is built around two principles, kin selection and reciprocal altruism.&quot; The principle of kin selection or inclusive fitness states that human beings will act altruistically toward genetic relatives (or individuals believed to be genetic relatives) in rough proportion to their shared genes. The principle of reciprocal altruism says that human beings will tend to develop relationships of mutual benefit or mutual harm as they interact with other individuals over time. Reciprocal altruism, unlike kin selection, does not depend on genetic relatedness; it does, however, depend on repeated, direct personal interaction and the trust relationships generated out of such interactions. These forms of social cooperation are the default ways human beings interact in the absence of incentives to adhere to other, more impersonal institutions. When impersonal institutions decay, these are the forms of cooperation that always reemerge because they are natural to human beings. What I have labeled patrimonialism is political recruitment based on either of these two principles. Thus, when bureaucratic offices were filled with the kinsmen of rulers at the end of the Han Dynasty in China, when the Janissaries wanted their sons to enter the corps, or when offices were sold as heritable property in ancien regime France, a natural patrimonial principle was simply reasserting itself.

== Examples ==

Richard Pipes cited the Egyptian Ptolemies and the Attalids of Pergamon as early patrimonial monarchies, both successor states to Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire.

Pipes argues that the Russia between the twelfth and seventeenth century, and with certain modifications until 1917, was a patrimonial system.

Jean Bodin described seigneurial monarchies in the &quot;Six Books of the Commonwealth&quot; (1576–1586), where the monarch owns all the land. He claimed that Turkey and Muscovy were the only European examples.

Indonesia, before and during the Suharto administration, is often cited as being patrimonial in its political-economy.

Randall Collins argued, based on Max Weber&#x27;s definition, that organized crime groups like gangs and mafia are patrimonial political organizations, as contrasted with the bureaucratic nature of modern states.

Johnathan Rauch claimed that Donald Trump, particularly during his second administration was patrimonial due to what Rauch described as a refusal to follow national rules, norms, and institutions.

<text>José Maria da Silva Paranhos Júnior, Baron of Rio Branco (in Portuguese: &quot;Barão do Rio Branco&quot;) (20 April 1845 – 10 February 1912) was a Brazilian noble, diplomat, geographer, historian, politician and professor, considered to be the &quot;father of Brazilian diplomacy&quot;. He was the son of statesman José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco. The Baron of Rio Branco was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, occupying its 34th chair from 1898 until his death in 1912. As a representative of Brazil, he managed to peacefully resolve all Brazil&#x27;s border disputes with its South American neighbours and incorporate 900 thousand square kilometers (roughly 10% of Brazil&#x27;s territory) through his diplomacy alone.

==Biography==
===Early life===
José Paranhos Júnior was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1845, as son of José Maria da Silva Paranhos Sr, Viscount of Rio Branco, future Prime Minister of Brazil and famous statesman and his wife, Teresa de Figueiredo Faria. He began his work in the letters in 1863, in the pages of the &quot;Popular magazine&quot;, with a biography on Luís Barroso Pereira, commander of the frigate &quot;Imperatriz&quot;. Later, in 1866, in the magazine L&#x27;Illustration, he drew and wrote about the Paraguayan War, defending the point of view of Brazil. In 1868, he replaced for three months Joaquim Manuel de Macedo as lecturer of Chorography and History of Brazil, in Colégio Pedro II.

===Diplomacy===

He began his political career as a promoter and deputy, still in the Empire. In 1871 he was editor in the newspaper &quot;A Nação&quot;, having collaborated, from 1891, in &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot;.

He became Consul General in Liverpool from 1876, was accredited minister in Germany in 1900, taking over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 3 December 1902 until his death in 1912. He held the position throughout the term of four presidents of the republic - the governments of Rodrigues Alves, Afonso Pena, Nilo Peçanha and Hermes da Fonseca - forming a national unanimity in their time.

He received the title of Baron of Rio Branco on the eve of the end of the imperial period, but continued to use the title in his signature even after the proclamation of the republic in 1889. This was due to being a convinced monarchist and to honor his late father, the senator and diplomat José Maria da Silva Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco.

===Nobleman===

In 1889, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil ennobled him as the Baron of Rio Branco (&quot;Barão do Rio Branco&quot;), a few days before the proclamation of the republic. Rio Branco continued to use the title throughout his life, despite governmental prohibition, because of his monarchist beliefs . Being a monarchist, however, was no impediment for his success as a diplomat: the Baron of Rio Branco reached the heights of his career during the Republic, when he acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs for 10 years and settled all of Brazil&#x27;s remaining border disputes by peaceful means.

===Last years===

Suffering from kidney problems, he offered his resignation, which was refused by President Hermes da Fonseca.
In his last moments of life, he lamented the bombing of the capital of Bahia, Salvador, motivated by a political crisis and which occurred on 10 January 1912.

His death, during the carnival of 1912, altered the calendar of the popular feast that year due to official mourning and great tributes in his honor in the city of Rio de Janeiro. He was buried along his father, in the Caju Cemetery in Rio de Janeiro.

Rio Branco is considered the patron of Brazilian diplomacy.

==Career history and legacy==

Rio Branco began his political career as a congressman in the House of Commons. From 1876 on, he was the Brazilian Consul General in Liverpool, England. He was also the Brazilian Ambassador in Berlin in the beginning of the 20th century.

Rio Branco&#x27;s most important legacy to Brazil was his successful effort, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, in defining the country&#x27;s borders with all of its neighbours. He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1902 and retained office until 1912, under four different Presidents, a feat unequalled in Brazilian history.

Before and during his term, he negotiated territorial disputes between Brazil and some of its neighbours and consolidated the borders of modern Brazil. He is considered one of the most prominent Brazilian statesmen ever, as his proverbial work capacity, knowledge and skills were essential for the successful outcome of difficult boundary disputes, some of which submitted to international arbitration – such as with Argentina and France –, as well as for incorporating new territory (the state of Acre, originally Bolivian).

As a mediator he negotiated and settled disputes between the United States and many European countries. On those occasions, he never abandoned his belief in diplomacy as the means to handle international matters, thus helping establish Brazil&#x27;s reputation as a peace-loving nation.

==Resolved boundary disputes==
===Border question with France===
Rio Branco obtained a victory over France on the border of Amapá with French Guiana, cause won by Brazil in 1900 in an arbitration of the Swiss government. The border was defined in the river Oiapoque.

===Treaty of Petrópolis with Bolivia===

In 1903 Rio Branco signed the Treaty of Petrópolis with Bolivia, putting an end to the dispute involving the present Brazilian state of Acre. The region was settled mostly by native Brazilians, but the Bolivian government had come close to leasing this rubber-rich area to American private entrepreneurs. Today, the state&#x27;s capital bears the name Rio Branco in his honor.

===Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty with Ecuador===

The representative of Brazil, Don José Maria da Silva Paranhos, who was Baron of Rio Branco met the representative of Ecuador, Dr. Carlos R. Tobar, in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, to peacefully discuss a final border between their countries. On May 6, 1904, an agreement was reached and the two representatives signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty, in which Ecuador renounced its claims to the disputed area between the Caquetá River and the Amazon River in favour of Brazil, in return Brazil recognized Ecuador as its neighbour. The border would be a straight line that starts midpoint between the cities of Tabatinga, Brazil and Leticia, Colombia, on the Amazon River and runs north until it reaches the Caquetá River, also known as the Japurá River.

===Other success===

Rio Branco has negotiated with Uruguay the condominium on the Rio Jaguarão and Lagoon Mirim, essentially a voluntary concession from Brazil to a neighbor who needed those channels. For this reason, he was honored by the government of Uruguay, and his name was given to the old Pueblo Artigas, now the city of Río Branco, in the department of Cerro Largo, near the Brazilian Jaguarão.

The municipality of Paranhos, in Mato Grosso do Sul, located on the border with Paraguay was baptized in his honor.
In 1908, then in Rio de Janeiro, he invited the engineer Augusto Ferreira Ramos to design a cable car system that would facilitate access to the summit of Morro da Urca, known worldwide as the Sugar Loaf.
In 1909, his name was suggested for the presidential succession of the following year. Rio Branco preferred to decline any candidacy that was not of national unanimity.

He was president of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute (1907-1912) and wrote two books.

His son, Paulo do Rio Branco, was a prominent French-born Brazilian rugby player.

==Popularity==

In 1909, Rio Branco was encouraged to run for the Presidency, but he declined, as he could not envisage consensus around his name. He was very popular, however, among the people; at the time of his death, to the point of paralysing Carnival – another unparalleled feat in Brazilian history – on the day he died (February 10), when official mourning was declared. The first recorded instance of an official moment of silence dedicated to a person&#x27;s death took place in Portugal on February 13, 1912. The Portuguese Senate dedicated 10 minutes of silence to the baron. This moment of silence was registered in the Senate&#x27;s records of that day.

As a writer he wrote many books, dealing mostly with the history of Brazil, and was awarded prizes and occupied the 34th seat of the Brazilian Academy of Literature.

Brazil&#x27;s diplomacy academy (Instituto Rio Branco) is named after the Baron. 
Rio Branco is portrayed on the fifty centavos coin of the Brazilian real currency.

<doc id="853104" wikidata="Q4631903" url="?curid=853104" title="24 Squadron SAAF">
<text>24 Squadron SAAF is a disbanded squadron of the South African Air Force. Its last role was as an attack aircraft squadron. The squadron was first formed during World War II on 5 March 1941 by renumbering 14 Squadron SAAF in Egypt. It later carried out bombing operations in Kenya and North Africa, before taking part in the Italian campaign before disbanding in late 1945 at the conclusion of hostilities. The squadron was later re-raised and operated jet aircraft in an attack role during the Border War. It was finally disbanded in early 1991.

==History==
On 5 March 1941 24 Squadron SAAF was formed when No.14 Squadron SAAF and its Maryland bombers were moved from Kenya to Egypt, and renumbered as No.24 Squadron. The squadron then operated alongside No. 39 Squadron RAF as a daytime tactical bomber unit carrying out bombing sorties against targets in the Mediterranean theatre. 24 Squadron was later in the year re-equipped with Bostons.

In December 1943, the squadron was relocated to Algeria and re-equipped with the B-26 Marauders and in 1944 flew to a new base at Pescara, Italy, before later advancing to Jesi, Italy. At the end of the war the squadron used its Marauders as transport aircraft, before moving to Egypt in October 1945 and disbanding on 6 November 1945.

The Buccaneer entered SAAF service in 1965. SAAF Buccaneers saw active service during the Border War in South-West Africa, notably at Cassinga in 1978. They flew over Angola and Namibia in the 1970s and 1980s, and attacked SWAPO guerrilla camps with rockets and bombs.

The squadron was disbanded in March 1991 at AFB Waterkloof, Pretoria.

<text>Ulm Minster () is a Lutheran church (formerly a Roman Catholic church) located in Ulm, State of Baden-Württemberg (Germany). It is the tallest church in the world. The church is the fifth-tallest structure built before the 20th century, with a steeple measuring 161.53 metres.

Though it is sometimes referred to as Ulm Cathedral because of its great size, the church is not a cathedral as it has never been the episcopal see of a bishop. Though the towers and all decorative elements are of stone masonry, attracting the attention of visitors, most of the walls, including the façades of the nave and choir, actually consist of visible brick. Therefore, the building is sometimes referred to as a brick church. As such, it lays claim to the rank of second- to fourth-largest, after San Petronio Basilica in Bologna and together with Frauenkirche in Munich and St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Gdańsk. The tower however was mainly built from sandstone.

Ulm Minster was begun in the Gothic architecture of the Late Middle Ages but the building was not completed until the late 19th century after a hiatus of centuries. When work ceased in the 16th century all of the church except the towers and some outer decorations were complete, unlike at Cologne Cathedral, where less than half of the work had been done before construction halted in the 15th century.

Visitors can climb the 768 steps that lead to the top of the minster&#x27;s spire. At it gives a panoramic view of Ulm in Baden-Württemberg and Neu-Ulm in Bavaria and, in clear weather, a vista of the Alps from Säntis to the Zugspitze. The final stairwell to the top (known as the third Gallery) is a tall, spiralling staircase that has barely enough room for one person.

==History==
===First construction phase, 1377-1543===
The original parish church in Ulm was built at the gate of the city outside the walls, and this caused much trouble for the citizens of the city in the 14th century&#x27;s conflicts that involved Ulm, as demonstrated by Emperor Charles IV&#x27;s siege of the city. This parish church had also been subordinated to Reichenau Monastery by Charlemagne in 813, and the denizens of Ulm wanted a new, independent church inside the city&#x27;s walls. To this end, the near 10,000 inhabitants of the city decided to finance construction themselves. On 30 June 1377, Mayor Ludwig Krafft laid the first stone, the foundation stone, of the new church. This church, whose design would be given to Heinrich Parler, the architect of Holy Cross Minster in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The first plan was to build a stepped hall church with aisles as wide and almost as high as the central nave, with a main spire on the west and two steeples above the choir ( long, wide). The women of the Ulmer Assemblage would also make their contributions to the foundation works, something memorialized by 17th and 18th century composer Barbara Kluntz.

Michael Parler II, who had experience from working at the Dombauhütte in Prague, assumed construction of the church in 1381 and continued work on the nave, which had originally been conceived as a triple-aisled hall church with approximately equal height and width. From 1387 to 1391, Heinrich III Parler managed construction as head of the Bauhütte. Then in 1392 Ulrich Ensingen, associated with Strasbourg Cathedral, was appointed master builder. It was Parler&#x27;s plan to construct the Ulm Minster&#x27;s spire, the highest of any church. In order to balance its proportions, the nave was now to be much taller than the Parlers had intended, making a noticeable difference in height between the chancel and nave. The church was consecrated on 25 July 1405. In 1446, Ulrich&#x27;s son Matthäus took over construction and finished the choir vault in 1449 and the vault over the northern nave in 1452. When he died in 1463, his own son, Moritz, took over construction. Himself dying in 1471, he completed the vaulting over the nave and constructed the sacrament house, finally making the church a basilica according to Ulrich&#x27;s plan.

In 1477, Matthäus Böblinger took over and made changes to the plans of the church but especially to the main tower and in doing so caused the church&#x27;s first major structural threat: the heavy vaults of the wide aisles and high nave burdened the columns with too much lateral force at different heights. A new master builder, Burkhart Engelberg of Augsburg, tackled the structural damage by reinforcing the foundation of the west tower and demolishing the heavy aisle vaults and replacing them with vaults of half widths, which afforded rows of additional columns dividing each of the aisles in two. Although catastrophe had been avoided, the walls were left without their buttresses for 350 years and the northern wall of the nave bulges outward by even today.

In a referendum in 1530/31, the citizens of Ulm converted to Protestantism during the Reformation. Ulm Minster became a Lutheran church. Despite its vast size, it is not a cathedral, as the responsible bishop of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg – member of the Evangelical Church in Germany – resides in Stuttgart.

In 1543, construction work ceased at a time when the steeple had reached a height of some . The suspension of the building process was due to a variety of factors which were political and religious, like the Reformation, as well as economic, since the discovery of the Americas during the voyages of Christopher Columbus 1492–1504, the Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India in 1497–99, and Magellan&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe led to an epochal shift in trade routes and commodities. One result was economic stagnation and a steady decline, preventing major public expenditure.

=== Resumption and completion of construction, 1844-1890 ===
In 1817, the interior frescos were covered by painting the walls grey. In 1844, construction work resumed. After a phase of repairs lasting until 1856, the central nave was stabilized by the addition of flying buttresses. Then the small steeples beside the choir were built – without medieval plans. At last, the main steeple was completed, changing the available medieval plan in making it about ten metres taller. Finally, on 31 May 1890 the building was completed.

===World War II===
A devastating air raid hit Ulm on 17 December 1944, which destroyed virtually the entire town west of the church to the railway station and north of the church to the outskirts. The church itself was barely damaged. However, almost all the other buildings of the town square (Münsterplatz) were severely hit and some 80% of the medieval centre of Ulm was destroyed.

A 500 kg-bomb fell on March 1, 1945 in the choir-room of the minster, but it did not explode.

===Current events===
Due to renovation work, the Minster Tower had been closed after the first platform (70m) and parts of the nave have been closed to visitors since March 2023, however as of August 2024 the tower is now open up to the second platform and only the uppermost portion remains off limits.

== Bells ==
The tower contains 13 bells in total and only 10 of the 13 swing. 6 bells in including the bourdon &quot;Gloriosa&quot; were cast by Heinrich Kurtz in Stuttgart 1956. Three bells serve for the clock, &quot;Leichenglocke&quot; is responsible to chime the quarter-hours, followed by the second largest bell &quot;Dominica&quot; chimes the hours. Prior to Dominica chiming the hours, a small bell called the &quot;Schlagglocke&quot; in the octagon also calls the hours. 

Only 9 of the 10 main bells swing electronically, this is because one of them known as the &quot;Schwörglocke&quot; rings only on Oath Monday via hand. The Schwörglocke is also the oldest bell in the Minister. In Germany, the bells are always numbered from largest to smallest, Bell 1 is always the tenor or bourdon.
==Architecture==
While the walls of the choir, the side aisles and the tower were constructed of brick, the upper levels of the nave are ashlar, using sandstone from Isny im Allgäu. Limestone from the nearby Swabian Jura was used in small quantities.

Works of art
* Late medieval sculptures include the tympanum of the main Western entrance depicts scenes from the Genesis. The central column bears a sculpture, the &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot;, by the local master Hans Multscher.
* The 15th century choir stalls by Jörg Syrlin the Elder, made from oak and adorned with hundreds of carved busts are among the most famous pews of the Gothic period.
* The pulpit canopy is by Jörg Syrlin the Younger.
* The original high altar was destroyed by the iconoclasts of the Reformation. The current altarpiece from the early 16th century is a triptych, showing figures of the Holy Family and the Last Supper in the predella.
* The five stained glass windows of the apse, which is in the form of half a decagon, show Biblical scenes and date to the 14th and 15th century.
*The main organ of the church was destroyed by iconoclasts and replaced in the late 16th century. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is known to have played it in 1763. For some decades it was the largest organ in existence. In the late 1960s it was reconstructed to solve acoustic problems of reverberation.
*In 1877, the Jewish congregation of the synagogue of Ulm—including Hermann Einstein, the father of Albert Einstein—donated money for a statue of the Biblical prophet Jeremiah. The figure was placed below the main organ.
*Later renovations in the modern era added gargoyles and a sculpture, &quot;The Beggar&quot;, by the expressionist Ernst Barlach.

<text>Constriction is a method used by several snake species to kill or subdue their prey. Although some species of venomous and mildly venomous snakes do use constriction to subdue their prey, most snakes which use constriction lack venom. The snake strikes at its prey and holds on, pulling the prey into its coils or, in the case of very large prey, pulling itself onto the prey. The snake then wraps one or two loops around the prey, forming a constriction coil. The snake monitors the prey&#x27;s heartbeat to ascertain it is dead. This can be a physically demanding and potentially dangerous procedure for the snake, because its metabolism is accelerated up to sevenfold and it becomes vulnerable to attack by another predator.

Contrary to myth, the snake does not generally crush the prey, or break its bones. However, wild anacondas have been observed to cause broken bones in large prey. Also contrary to prior belief, the snake does not suffocate the victim.  Instead, a study of boa constrictors showed that constriction halts blood flow and prevents oxygen from reaching vital organs such as the heart and brain, leading to unconsciousness within seconds and cardiac arrest shortly thereafter. Further, multiple species of snakes have been shown to constrict with pressures higher than those needed to induce cardiac arrest. In conjunction with observations of oral and nasal hemorrhaging in prey, constriction pressures are also thought to interfere with neural processing by forcing blood towards the brain. In other words, constriction can work by different mechanisms at varying pressures. It likely interferes with breathing at low pressures, can interrupt blood flow and overwhelm the prey&#x27;s usual blood pressure and circulation at moderate pressures, and can interfere with neural processing and damage tissues at high pressures. 

During constriction when the prey&#x27;s heart is impeded, arterial pressure drops while venous pressure increases, and blood vessels begin to close. The heart is not strong enough to pump against the pressure and blood flow stops. Internal organs with high metabolic rates, including the brain, liver, and heart, begin to stop functioning and die due to ischemia, a loss of oxygen and glucose. There is evidence that boa constrictors have more difficulty killing ectotherms—animals like lizards and snakes that rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures. A boa constrictor was observed attacking a spinytail iguana for an hour, and the iguana survived.

This relatively recent research (2015) suggests that other constrictors may kill in other ways. It had previously been accepted that constrictors used their body to hold the prey tight enough to prevent it from breathing, resulting in death from asphyxia, or that the pressure of constriction increases the pressure inside the prey&#x27;s body higher than the heart can counteract, resulting in cardiac arrest; data from earlier studies had also indicated that snakes can exert enough pressure for these to be plausible.

Certain groups of snakes have characteristic patterns of constriction, including the number of coils they use and the orientation of the coils.

Venomous snakes that also use constriction include the genus Clelia (ophiophagous South American mildly venomous rear-fanged colubrids which use constriction to subdue snakes including pit vipers), the western terrestrial garter snake (North American colubrid which is an inefficient constrictor and, like most &quot;Thamnophis&quot; garter snakes, mildly venomous), some species of &quot;Boiga&quot; snakes (Asian and Australian rear-fanged colubrids) including the brown tree snake (&quot;Boiga irregularis&quot;), some species of Australian elapids (including some of the venomous &quot;Pseudonaja&quot; brown snakes and one Australian coral snake &quot;Simoselaps&quot;), and a few Australian colubrids.

<text>Fortitude Valley railway station is located on the North Coast line in Queensland, Australia. Located beneath the Valley Metro complex, it serves the central Brisbane suburb of Fortitude Valley. The station is one of four inner city stations that form a core corridor through the centre of Brisbane.

Pedestrian access to the station is via two thoroughfares near the corner of Brunswick and Wickham Streets and a pedestrian overpass connecting to McWhirters. There is also a lesser known entrance through the car park at the Northern side of the station, both out to Alfred Street in the West and Alden Street in the east, the latter through a secluded elevator in the eastern side of the car parking complex.

On the Path to the overpass to McWhirters, exists two escalators that lead down to Wickham Street, however due to political issues these escalators are non-functional and are normally closed off with a metal door.

==History==
The station opened on 1 November 1890 as Brunswick Street with the completion of the railway from Brisbane Central.

In July 2007, an upgrade on the station commenced but being a busy station, only two platforms were able to be upgraded at any one time.

The upgrade was completed in October 2008 with escalators, elevators, new lighting, updated passenger information displays and upgraded flooring. With the upgrade completed, the station was renamed Fortitude Valley.

An upgrade of the Valley Metro Shopping centre (building that exists around the station) commenced in 2017 and has the potential to upgrade the entrances to the station.

==Services==
Fortitude Valley station is served by all suburban and interurban City network lines. Also see Inner City timetable

<doc id="853119" wikidata="Q271938" url="?curid=853119" title="Helen Baxendale">
<text>Helen Victoria Baxendale (born 7 June 1970) is an English actress of stage and television. She is known for her roles as Rachel Bradley in the British comedy drama &quot;Cold Feet&quot; (1997–2003) and Emily Waltham in the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (1998–1999).

Baxendale&#x27;s early stage credits include &quot;The Soldiers&quot; at Glasgow&#x27;s Citizens Theatre, which earned her a 1993 Ian Charleson Award nomination. Her other television credits include &quot;Cardiac Arrest&quot; (1994–1996), &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot; (1997–1999), &quot;Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years&quot; (2001), &quot;Cuckoo&quot; (2012–2019) and &quot;Noughts + Crosses&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
Baxendale was born on 7 June 1970 in Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire. Baxendale&#x27;s parents were teachers at a comprehensive school. Her sister is the screenwriter Katie Baxendale.

She grew up in Shenstone, Staffordshire, and attended King Edward VI School, Lichfield. She wanted to be a ballet dancer and trained at the Elmhurst School for Dance, until dropping out aged 17 in favour of an acting career. She moved to the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, then worked at the Glasgow Citizens&#x27; Theatre from 1992 to 1995.

==Career==
===Television===
====Early television====
Via her work at Glasgow Citizens&#x27; Theatre, Baxendale was cast in hospital TV series &quot;Cardiac Arrest&quot;, though it was not her first television role. Her performance as Dr Claire Maitland earned her a Scottish BAFTA nomination in 1995. Her role as Rachel Bradley in the TV series &quot;Cold Feet&quot; garnered her a British Comedy Award nomination. She starred in &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot;, playing Cordelia Gray. The Independent stated: &quot;her early roles were defined by icy cool, sleek bobs and ironic detachment.&quot;

====&quot;Friends&quot;====
Aged 27 Baxendale was cast in a recurring role in &quot;Friends&quot; as Ross Geller&#x27;s girlfriend, wife and ultimately ex-wife Emily Waltham. She appeared in fourteen episodes throughout Season 4 and early Season 5. Speaking to &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2022, Baxendale said &quot;I saw those people in &quot;Friends&quot;, for example, and thought: I don&#x27;t think that life is really what I want. They were hounded. They weren&#x27;t able to walk into a supermarket and buy something...&quot; On the attention she received for being in &quot;Friends&quot;, she said, &quot;This thing… this programme that I happened to be in for a few episodes. The whole thing was bonkers.&quot; Director James Burrows said about Baxendale &quot;...was nice but not particularly funny. Schwimmer had no one to bounce off. It was like clapping with one hand.&quot;

====Post &quot;Friends&quot;====
Other notable roles include Lorna Johnson in &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; alongside John Hannah, Caroline Meagher in &quot;The Investigator&quot; alongside Laura Fraser, and Julie Matthews in Curt Truninger&#x27;s &quot;Dead by Monday&quot;. She was nominated for another Scottish BAFTA in 1997 for her role as Lorna Johnson. &quot;Dead by Monday&quot; won the Angel Award for Best Film at the Monaco International Film Festival in 2003 and the Portland Festival of World Cinema award for best feature film in 2001. She played Pandora Braithwaite in &quot;Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Maggie&quot; in the multiple award-winning &quot;Bolse Vita&quot;. She appeared in &quot;Saving Nellie&quot;, a physics programme running on Teachers TV. From 2007 to January 2008 she starred in &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot; alongside Christian Slater at London&#x27;s Vaudeville Theatre.

In 2010, Baxendale appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; as Susan Harmison. In January 2011, she co-starred with Trevor Eve in the three-part ITV drama &quot;Kidnap and Ransom&quot;, filmed on location in South Africa. Later in 2011, she starred as DCI Marion Bettany in Val McDermid&#x27;s radio crime drama &quot;Village SOS&quot;. In 2012 she reprised her role in the second episode. She then appeared in the &quot;Inspector George Gently&quot; episode &quot;The Lost Child&quot; alongside Mark Gatiss. From 2012 to 2019, she starred in &quot;Cuckoo&quot; as Lorna, the mother in-law of the titular Dale &#x27;Cuckoo&#x27; Ashbrick. In 2020 she played housekeeper Meggie McGregor in &quot;Noughts + Crosses&quot;.

===Stage===
Baxendale starred as Christine in Patrick Marber&#x27;s &quot;After Miss Julie&quot;, and in 2005 appeared as Romy, the title role in &quot;The Woman Before&quot; at the Royal Court alongside Nigel Lindsay, Saskia Reeves, Tom Riley and Georgia Taylor. She played Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (the Marovitz Hamlet) alongside Henry Ian Cusick. She was nominated for an Ian Charleson Award (best classical actor under 30) for her 1993 performance in &quot;Soldiers&quot; at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre. In 2009 Baxendale played Lara in &quot;Amongst Friends&quot; alongside Aden Gillett and Emma Cunniffe at Hampstead Theatre.

===Radio===
In 2008, Baxendale guest starred in episode three of the award-winning BBC radio comedy &quot;Cabin Pressure&quot;.

==Personal life==
Baxendale has been with her boyfriend David L. Williams since her Glasgow days. Together they have three children. Her first pregnancy was written into &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot; and her second was written into the fourth series of &quot;Cold Feet&quot;. Baxendale&#x27;s oldest child is the actress Nell Williams.

Due to Baxendale&#x27;s first pregnancy, and that she lived in the UK rather than the US, her character was written out of &quot;Friends&quot; earlier than the writers had originally intended. She appeared in only 14 episodes, despite her character dating, marrying, and divorcing Ross Geller, one of the show&#x27;s six leads.
