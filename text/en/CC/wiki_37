<text>Christian Adolph &quot;Sonny&quot; Jurgensen III (born August 23, 1934) is an American former professional football quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons, playing for the Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Redskins. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Jurgensen was also a longtime color commentator for Washington&#x27;s radio broadcast crew.

==Early life==
Jurgensen was born on August 23, 1934, in Wilmington, North Carolina. He started playing sports in elementary school, when he led his school to the city grammar school titles in baseball and basketball. He later won Wilmington&#x27;s youth tennis championship and pitched for his local Civitan club, which won the city baseball title.

Jurgensen attended and played high school football at New Hanover High School. He played a number of positions for the team and as a junior was a backup quarterback on the state championship team. After a senior year where he scored three touchdowns and kicked nine extra points, he was chosen to start at quarterback for the North Carolina team in the annual North Carolina vs. South Carolina Shrine Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Jurgensen also played basketball and baseball during high school. As a senior on the basketball team, he averaged 12 points per game as a guard and the team was the state title runner-up. That same year in baseball, he batted .339 and played as a pitcher, infielder, and catcher. He also became a switch-hitter.

==College career==
Jurgensen attended and played college football at Duke University. He joined the varsity team in 1954 as a backup quarterback behind Jerry Barger and he completed 12 of 28 passes for 212 yards, with one touchdown and three interceptions.

But Jurgensen made the biggest impact that season as a defensive back, when he tied a team record with interceptions in four consecutive games. and ended the season with five interceptions. Duke finished the campaign with a 7–2–1 regular-season record and an Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) title. Then on New Year&#x27;s Day, Duke beat the Nebraska Cornhuskers 34–7 in the 1955 Orange Bowl.

Jurgensen took over as starting quarterback in 1955. He also retained a starting position in the defensive secondary.

Duke ended the season with a 7–2–1 record along with an ACC co-championship, but did not go to a bowl because Maryland received the league&#x27;s automatic bid to the Orange Bowl. That season Jurgensen completed 37 of 69 passes for 536 yards, three touchdowns and seven interceptions. He rushed 54 times for 48 yards and scored two touchdowns. He also punted four times for a 33.7 average and intercepted four passes for 17 yards.

Jurgensen&#x27;s senior season in 1956 did not start well, when Duke lost to South Carolina, 7–0, in the season opener. This game marked Duke&#x27;s first ACC loss, coming in the fourth year of the conference&#x27;s existence. Duke finished the season with a 5–4–1 mark and Jurgensen ended up 28–59 for 371 yards.

He threw six interceptions and two touchdown passes and rushed 25 times for 51 yards with three touchdowns. Jurgensen&#x27;s final career stats included 77–156 passes for 1,119 yards, 16 interceptions and six touchdowns. He also rushed for 109 yards and intercepted 10 passes.

Jurgensen also played baseball briefly at Duke and turned down an invitation to try out for the basketball team.

Before being drafted by the NFL, Jurgensen worked as a Sunday school bus driver in Herndon, Virginia.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Eagles (1957–1963)===
Jurgensen was drafted in the fourth round (43rd overall) of the 1957 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. He was Philadelphia&#x27;s backup quarterback behind Bobby Thomason in 1957 and Norm Van Brocklin from 1958 through 1960. It was during this time as a backup that Jurgensen was a part of a championship team for the only time in his professional career, when the Eagles won the 1960 NFL Championship. Although he did not play quarterback in any playoff games, Jurgensen was the holder for field goals and extra points.

After Van Brocklin retired in 1961, Jurgensen took over as Philadelphia&#x27;s starter and had a successful year, passing for an NFL record 3,723 yards, tying the NFL record with 32 touchdown passes, and was named All-Pro.

===Washington Redskins (1964–1974)===

Jurgensen was traded to the Washington Redskins on April 1, 1964, in exchange for Norm Snead and Claude Crabb. He was then selected to play in the Pro Bowl following the season and was also named second Team All-Pro.

One of Jurgensen&#x27;s most memorable games was during the 1965 season, when the Dallas Cowboys took a 21–0 lead at DC Stadium. Jurgensen then threw for 411 yards, leading the team back to win 34–31. He rushed for a touchdown on a quarterback sneak and threw a game-winning 35-yard pass to Bobby Mitchell. In 1967, Jurgensen broke his own record by passing for 3,747 yards and also set NFL single-season records for attempts (508) and completions (288). Injuries hampered his performance during the 1968 season, however, with Jurgensen missing two games with broken ribs and suffering chronic pain in the elbow of his throwing arm due to calcium deposits. Jurgensen threw the ball just 292 times during the year, completing 167 for 1,980 yards and 17 touchdowns.

However, he tied an NFL record early in the 1968 season for the longest pass play in league history. The 99-yard pass play to Jerry Allen occurred September 15, 1968, during the Redskins&#x27; game against the Chicago Bears. Coincidentally, Redskins&#x27; quarterbacks had three of the first four occurrences of a 99-yard pass play (Frank Filchock to Andy Farkas in 1939 and George Izo to Bobby Mitchell in 1963 were the other two occurrences of the play). Since Jurgensen&#x27;s feat, no other Redskins&#x27; quarterback has completed a 99-yard pass.

In 1969, Vince Lombardi took over as the Redskins&#x27; head coach. That season, Jurgensen led the NFL in attempts (442), completions (274), completion percentage (62%), and passing yards (3,102). The Redskins went 7–5–2 and had their best season since 1955 (which kept Lombardi&#x27;s record of never having coached a losing NFL team intact). Lombardi died of cancer shortly before the start of the 1970 season. Jurgensen would later say that, of the nine head coaches he played for during his NFL career, Lombardi was his favorite.

The Redskins enjoyed a resurgence in the early 1970s under coach George Allen and made it as far as Super Bowl VII, losing to the Miami Dolphins. However, Billy Kilmer started in place of Jurgensen, who was again bothered by injuries in 1971 and 1972.

During this period, a quarterback controversy developed between the two, complete with fans sporting &quot;I Love Billy&quot; or &quot;I Love Sonny&quot; bumper stickers on their vehicles. The defensive-minded Allen preferred Kilmer&#x27;s conservative, ball-control style of play to Jurgensen&#x27;s more high-risk approach. Despite the controversy, Jurgensen was helpful to his rival. Even to this day, Kilmer still stays at Jurgensen&#x27;s house when he is in town.

In 1974, at the age of 40 and in his final season, Jurgensen won his third NFL passing crown even though he was still splitting time with Kilmer. In the final game of his NFL career, Jurgensen made his first and only appearance as a quarterback in an NFL postseason game in the Redskins&#x27; 19–10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the first round of the 1974 NFC playoffs. He came off the bench in relief of Kilmer and completed six of 12 passes but also threw three interceptions.

Jurgensen is recognized as the finest pure passer of his time. A five-time Pro Bowl selection, he earned three NFL individual passing titles. He exceeded 400 yards passing in a single game five times, and threw five touchdown passes in a game twice. With a career rating of 82.6, his stats include 2,433 completions for 32,224 yards and 255 touchdowns. He also rushed for 493 yards and 15 touchdowns.

Jurgensen&#x27;s 82.62 career passer rating is the highest for any player in the &quot;Dead Ball Era&quot; (pre-1978).

Lombardi once told Pat Peppler of the Green Bay Packers head office that, &quot;If we would have had Sonny Jurgensen in Green Bay, we’d never have lost a game.”

==After football==
===Broadcasting career===
After retiring from the Redskins following the 1974 season, Jurgensen began another career as a color commentator, initially with CBS television. Later teaming with Hall of Fame linebacker Sam Huff, Jurgensen continued to cover the Washington Redskins on radio.

He covered the team for WRC-TV from 1994 until December 2008, when &quot;Redskins Report&quot; was canceled due to budget cuts. He served as a game analyst at preseason games and as studio analyst at training camp, making weekly picks, and other assignments. He retired from broadcasting prior to the 2019 season.

===Honors===

Jurgensen was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1971 and the Duke Sports Hall of Fame in 1979. He was then inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983. In 1999, Jurgensen was ranked the ninth best sports figure from North Carolina by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and became a member of Wilmington&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2004.

Washington retired Jurgensen&#x27;s #9 jersey in 2022, during their Week 18 game against the Dallas Cowboys.

He serves on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military services organization.

<doc id="854681" wikidata="Q7423968" url="?curid=854681" title="Sargon the Sorcerer">
<text>Sargon the Sorcerer is the name of several fictional characters appearing in DC Comics. The first version of the character appeared in 1941, during the period known to fans as the Golden Age.

The original incarnation of the character is John Sargent, son of archaeologist Richard Sargent, who gained magic powers after reciting an incantation while holding an artifact that had been given to him by his mother. Fearing a negative public reception from having genuine magic powers, Sargent formed a stage magician persona to disguise his abilities. Over time, he became a crime-fighter and was notably a peer of other magic users such as Zatara and Baron Winters. The character was later killed during a ritual meant to help the Swamp Thing and Deadman battle the Great Darkness.

The second Sargon, David Sargent, first appears in &quot;Helmet of Fate: Sargon&quot; #1 (April 2007) and was created by Steve Niles and Scott Hampton. David is the grandson of John Sargent. He gained a shard of the Ruby of Life from demons who had previously been unable to explore John’s estate due to magical protections; the demons were unaware of David’s relationship to John. Upon bestowing the shard in his chest, he succeeded his grandfather and established himself as a mystic superhero. The character&#x27;s tenure is short-lived, as he is seemingly killed by Lobo in Hell after sacrificing his own energies to transport heroes to the world of the living.

After the New 52 reboot, the character&#x27;s history changed; while John&#x27;s lifetime mirrors the Golden Age storyline, the character is instead succeeded by his daughter, Jaimini Sargent. Unlike prior depictions of Sargon, Jaimini is portrayed primarily as a villain. The character appears of East Indian descent and is an adversary of John Constantine, having usurped her father&#x27;s name as Sargon the Sorceress and his position within the Cult of the Cold Flame.

Sargon appeared in live-action in the Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, portrayed by Raúl Herrera.

== Publication history ==
John Sargent, the original Sargon, first appeared in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #26 (May 1941), and was created by John B. Wentworth and Howard Purcell. The character continued in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; until issue #50 (June 1943), and then moved to &quot;Comic Cavalcade&quot; (1943-1946) and &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; (1946-1948).

==Fictional character biography==
===John Sargent===

Sargon debuted in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #26, with a publication date of May 1941. He was a stage magician, dressed like a swami complete with turban, to disguise the fact that he wielded true mystic powers, passing off such feats as illusions. As a child, he came into possession of the mystic Ruby of Life which allowed him to control anything he touches (touching the ground lets him erect a wall, for instance).

Taking his professional name from the ancient king of the same name, Sargon has had a checkered career, acting mostly as a hero during the Golden Age aided first by his lady assistant Flora Styles, and later by his cartoonish fat little comic relief sidekick / manager Maximillian O&#x27;Leary as he battled crooks, spies and his azure-skinned archenemy the Blue Lama, the Queen of black magic.

He re-emerges in the Silver Age – as a villain, at least at first. It was later explained that his villainous activities were the result of certain side effects of possessing the Ruby of Life. He was brought back for occasional guest appearances in the Silver Age and was awarded with an honorary membership in the Justice League in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #99 in 1972. Sargon later explained that he moved from his home of Earth-Two to take up residence on Earth-One in 1950.

Sargon maintained contacts with several other mages in the DC Universe, notably Baron Winters, Zatara (a fellow &quot;faux&quot; stage magician), and the younger mage John Constantine. Sargon answered the summons of Constantine to participate in a ritual at the mansion of Winters to help deal with the effects of the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, using the Swamp Thing as their portal into the war being fought in Hell. Locking hands in a circle of power, and using the psychic powers of Constantine&#x27;s drunken acquaintance Mento, the group of sorcerers (which also included Zatara&#x27;s daughter Zatanna) observed the events unfolding, and attempted in turn to channel their magical powers into several other mystical characters present in Hell, including Etrigan, the original Doctor Fate, and the Spectre.

Their enemy, a primal form of evil (called the Great Evil Beast) that was surging upwards to obliterate everything in its path, sensed their interference and lashed out several times; its power raced around the circle, finding a weak link and incinerating it. The first to fall was Sargon. At first panicking and crying out for the others to help him, and almost pulling his hands away from the circle, Sargon was rebuked by Zatara to maintain his composure and die like a sorcerer. In a final act of will, Sargon apologized for his outburst, calmly sat in place and was burned alive without a whimper, never letting go of his colleagues&#x27; hands the entire time. This ritual also kills Zatara and drives Mento completely insane.

Sargon would later return in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;borrowing&quot; the body of an elderly German man named Koestler and planning to lead the souls trapped in Hell in an assault on Heaven. He sacrificed this form to save his niece, Gracie Brody.

During the &quot;Books of Magic&quot; series, the Phantom Stranger and young Timothy Hunter had a brief encounter with what was apparently Sargon&#x27;s soul, who attempted to warn the boy of the dangers and costs of pursuing magic power. He then disintegrated right before their eyes, leaving behind his Ruby of Life.

Sargon appears in the &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; series as a gray soul in the realm of Purgatory. He presumably joins in the fight against the guardians of Purgatory when a team of living heroes arrives to bring back the soul of Hal Jordan.

In 2011, DC Comics rebooted the DC universe in &quot;The New 52&quot;. Sargon appears briefly in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, where he is mentioned as one of the great magicians of the past age, among peers such as Zatara and Dr. Occult. In &quot;Constantine&quot; #1, Sargon is revealed to have been one of four powerful magicians who became corrupted by their power and formed the villainous cult known as the Cold Flame.

===David John Sargent===
The &quot;Helmet of Fate&quot; miniseries featured a &quot;Sargon the Sorcerer&quot; one-shot, starring his successor David John Sargent.

A college dropout and former band singer, David lived as a drifter. Two men claiming to represent the estate of his grandfather, the original Sargon, found David and told him that he was John’s heir. The men were demons trying to find Sargon&#x27;s Ruby of Life, but could not do so because of John’s protection spells.

David was tricked into signing away his grandfather&#x27;s estate over to the two men, who then prepared to force him to find the Ruby when the Helmet of Fate suddenly appeared. David escaped the two and was led into his grandfather&#x27;s secret attic by Sargon&#x27;s ghost. Searching around, he found his grandfather&#x27;s old props, his suit and turban, which contained some pieces of the Ruby. Those pieces then went into David&#x27;s chest; through them Sargon was able to project himself in front of his grandson. He explained to David that he needed a successor to his name to find the remaining pieces of the Ruby, which had somehow shattered, and he was the only member of his bloodline still alive. He also explained that he pulled the Helmet off its course in order to provide a distraction long enough to grant David the Ruby&#x27;s power.

David accepted the role of Sargon the Sorcerer, and armed with new mystical abilities, went to drive the two men from his home. At the time, the two used a piece of the Ruby they acquired to turn themselves into demons, and managed to weaken the Helmet. David then quickly disposed of the two, and sent the Helmet back on its course after placing a piece of himself into it.

David went on to play a part in &quot;Reign in Hell&quot;, assisting Zatanna and Blue Devil, and ultimately sacrificing himself to Lobo&#x27;s mercy to allow many heroes and anti-heroes out of Hell; this event left Zatanna and Blue Devil traumatized, as they were the ones who went to Sargon for help in the first place.

===Jaimini Sargent===
In the &quot;Constantine&quot;: &quot;The Spark and the Flame&quot;, Jamini is revealed to have taken the powers of her father (who has since became corrupted) and his role in the group, calling herself &quot;Sargon the Sorceress&quot;, and set her sights on Constantine as both sought to reconstruct a mystical item known as the &quot;Croyden Compass&quot;, a magic artifact that can seek out magic power sources, intent on increasing her already formidable sorcery. After learning Constantine was also after the artifact and already had gained its dial. As Constantine sought the lens, he is ensnared by Sargon, who attempts to force the location of the lens out of him, as she and Tannark were unable to find the lens within the shop of Agnus Croyden&#x27;s son, Phillip. Constantine reveals that his son&#x27;s eyes are the lens they sought but frees the Riddling Butcher, an enemy of Jaimini&#x27;s father in the past, and leaves her to fight the demon after predicting she would emerge victorious.

<text>The Diocese of Richmond () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical jurisdiction, or diocese, of the Catholic Church in Virginia in the United States. It is a suffragan diocese of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Baltimore.

The diocese&#x27;s current bishop is Barry C. Knestout, who was appointed by Pope Francis on December 5, 2017.

== Statistics ==
The Diocese of Richmond encompasses all of central and southern Virginia, the Hampton Roads area, and the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay.

As of 2022, the diocese had 135 diocesan and religious priests serving a Catholic population of 226,674 in 138 parishes and eight missions. The diocese was operating nine hospitals and seven facilities for the elderly.

==History==
===1600 to 1800===
Prior to the American Revolution, few Catholics lived in the British Colony of Virginia. Attempts to found Catholic settlements in Virginia were made by Lord Baltimore in 1629, and by Captain George Brent in 1687. In 1634, Reverend John Altham, a Jesuit companion of Reverend Andrew White, performed missionary work among the Native American tribes living on the south bank of the Potomac River.

The colonial government of Virginia soon enacted stringent laws against the practice of Catholicism. In 1687, Reverends Edmonds and Raymond were arrested at Norfolk, Virginia, for exercising their priestly functions. During the last quarter of the 18th century, the few Catholic settlers at Aquia Creek near the Potomac, were attended by Reverend John Carroll and other Jesuit missionaries from Maryland.

=== 1800 to 1820 ===
With the 1786 passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, proposed by future US President Thomas Jefferson, Catholics were granted religious freedom in the new State of Virginia. Reverend Jean Dubois, accompanied by several French priests and letters of introduction from the Marquis de Lafayette, arrived in Norfolk in August 1791. in December 1791, the Virginia General Assembly invited Dubois to celebrate a Mass in the courtroom of the new Virginia State House. This was the first Mass conducted anywhere in Richmond.

Future US President James Monroe hosted Dubois in Richmond until he was able to rent a house there. Dubois later opened a school to teach French, the classics and arithmetic. Virginia Governor Patrick Henry helped Dubois learn English. For two years, Dubois mainly celebrated Mass in rented rooms or at the homes of Richmond&#x27;s few Catholic families.

According to tradition, Alexandria had a log chapel with an unknown resident Catholic priest by 1776. Reverend John Thayer from Boston was stationed at the chapel in 1794. Reverend Francis Neale erected a brick church in Alexandria in 1796 and constructed a larger one there in 1811. Reverend Anthony Kohlmann and future Bishop Benedict Fenwick frequently officiated in Alexandria.

The first Catholic church in Norfolk was St. Patrick&#x27;s in 1791. Its parishioners were refugees who had fled France after the French Revolution in 1789. It is the oldest parish in the diocese. Around 1796, Reverend James Bushe started building new church in Norfolk. He was succeeded there by the future Archbishop Leonard Neale.

===1820 to 1850===

Pope Pius VII erected the Diocese of Richmond on July 11, 1820. He removed all of Virginia (except for the two counties of the Eastern Shore region) and present day West Virginia from the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Pius VII appointed Reverend Patrick Kelly as its first bishop. After arriving in New York in 1820, Kelly traveled to Baltimore to meet Bishop Ambrose Maréchal. Kelly wrote about to his brother about Maréchal:He did not receive me over kindly, and tried to persuade me it would be dangerous to take possession of my See; but his arguments did not satisfy me, and I arrived Norfolk on 19th January.In January 1821, Kelly took up residence in Norfolk which had a larger Catholic population than the episcopal see in Richmond. While bishop, Kelly opened the first Catholic school in the diocese and engaged in missionary efforts. Kelly was soon involved in disputes with Maréchal over their jurisdictions. To end the fighting, Pius VII appointed Kelly as bishop of the Diocese of Waterford and Lismore in Ireland in early 1822. There would be no new bishop in Richmond for the next 18 years.

Pope Gregory XVI named Reverend Richard Whelan as the new bishop of the Diocese of Richmond in 1840. Since Kelly&#x27;s departure in 1822, the diocese had been vacant. During that period, Richmond had become a stronghold of the Know-Nothing political party, known for its anti-Catholic bigotry and violence. As the diocese only had six priests, Whelan appealed to the Societies for the Propagation of the Faith in Paris, Lyon, France, and Vienna in the Austrian Empire to recruit priests. He also established a seminary college outside Richmond, where he resided and taught classes whenever he was in town. Whelan also established several parishes, missions and schools.

In 1848, Whelan petitioned Pope Pius IX to divide the Diocese of Richmond into two dioceses, with the Allegheny Mountains serving as the boundary. In 1850, Pope Pius IX erected the Diocese of Wheeling. He removed from the Diocese of Richmond all of Virginia west of the Allegheny Mountains and the state of Pennsylvania. Pius IX named Whelan bishop of the new diocese and replaced him in Richmond with Monsignor John McGill of the Diocese of Bardstown.

=== 1850 to 1870 ===

When McGill arrived in Richmond in 1850, the diocese had 7,000 Catholics, eight priests, and 10 churches. He convened the first diocesan synod in 1855. During his tenure, Virginia was devastated by yellow fever and cholera epidemics. Pius IX in 1858, transferred the territory of Alexandria to the Diocese of Richmond. The Federal government in 1846 had retroceded the city of Alexandria back to Virginia from the District of Columbia.

During the American Civil War, Catholics in the Confederate States were unable to purchase Catholic books published in the North. To fill the gap, McGill wrote, &quot;The True Church Indicated to the Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Our Faith, the Victory&quot;, republished as &quot;The Creed of Catholics&quot;. He also visited Union Army prisoners of war in the Libby Prison in Richmond, doing what he could to aid them. In 1867, McGill brought the Sisters of Charity from Emmitburgh, Maryland, to set up a school in the diocese. McGill died in 1872 and Pius IX named James Gibbons, then vicar apostolic of North Carolina, as the new bishop of Richmond. Gibbons stayed in Richmond for five years, at which point Pius IX appointed him coadjutor archbishop of Baltimore.

The start of the Civil War led to the formation of the state of West Virginia. It consisted of the western counties of Virginia, which had seceded from Virginia rather than be part of the breakaway Confederate States of America. However, the new state boundary between Virginia and West Virginia did not coincide with the boundary between the Dioceses of Wheeling and Richmond. This disparity endured for over a century. Pope Pius IX erected the new Diocese of Wilmington in 1868. As part of that new diocese, the pope removed two Eastern Shore counties from the Diocese of Richmond.

=== 1870 to 1910 ===

After McGill died in 1872, Pope Leo XIII appointed Reverend John J. Keane of the Archdiocese of Baltimore as the new bishop of Richmond. As bishop, Keane established the Confraternity of the Holy Ghost, a Catholic fellowship, in the diocese. He published &quot;A Sodality Manual for the Use of the Servants of the Holy Ghost&quot; in 1880. Despite opposition, Keane founded schools and churches for Catholic African-Americans in the diocese. He addressed Protestant groups to educate them about the Catholic Church. Keene was appointed rector of the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. in 1886. He resigned his post as bishop two years later to serve full time as rector.

In 1889, Leo XIII appointed Monsignor Augustine Van de Vyver as bishop of the Diocese of Richmond. In 1901, philanthropist Thomas Ryan and his wife donated almost $500,000 to buy the land and construct a new Sacred Heart Cathedral in Richmond. It was consecrated in 1906. While bishop, Van de Vyver open new religious congregations, schools and other Catholic institutions. With assistance from a donor, Van de Vyver opened an industrial college for African-American boys in Rock Castle, Virginia. Katherine Drexel, mother superior of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament. opened a school for African-American girls.

In August 1902, Reverend Joseph Anciaux a Belgian Josephite priest in Virginia wrote a letter to the Congregation of the Propaganda in Rome, condemning acceptance by the U.S. Catholic hierarchy of racial segregation in the United States. He called it a radical and non-Catholic policy, and accused Van de Vyver personally of timidity in the face of &quot;negro haters&quot;. In October 1902, Van de Vyver forced Anciaux to leave the diocese.

=== 1910 to 1970 ===

After Van de Vyver died in 1911, Pope Pius X named Auxiliary Bishop Denis J. O&#x27;Connell of the Archdiocese of San Francisco as the new bishop of Richmond. The first parish in Virginia Beach, the Star of the Sea, was established in 1915.

O&#x27;Connell resigned due to bad health in 1926 and Pope Pius XI named Auxiliary Bishop Andrew Brennan of the Diocese of Scranton to replace him. In 1929, at Brennan&#x27;s suggestion, the Holy Name Society of Richmond establish the Catholic Laymen&#x27;s League of Virginia. It was created to counteract the flow of anti-Catholic bigotry and misinformation in the media and from some Protestant ministers.

In 1935, Pius XI named Monsignor Peter Ireton of Baltimore to assist Brennan as coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Richmond, a job Ireton would hold for ten years. When Brennan resigned in 1945, Ireton automatically succeeded him as bishop of Richmond. During his tenure as bishop, Ireton established 42 parishes, built 24 schools, and increased the Catholic population from 37,000 to 147,000.

Ireton died in 1958 and Pius XI appointed Bishop John Russell from the Diocese of Charleston as his replacement. In implementing the Second Vatican Council reforms, Russell established a diocesan Commission on Ecumenical Affairs in 1963, and a diocesan Pastoral Council and a Council of Priests in 1966. A champion of civil rights, he had the parents of prospective students for Richmond&#x27;s Catholic schools be interviewed for signs of racism.

=== 1970 to 2000 ===
In 1970, Pope Paul VI named Monsignor Walter Sullivan as auxiliary bishop in Richmond. When Russell resigned in 1973, the pope appointed Sullivan as the new bishop. In 1974, Paul VI established the current boundaries of the Diocese of Richmond by:
* Transferring the two Eastern Shore counties, ceded to the Diocese of Wilmington in 1868, back to the Diocese of Richmond
* Erecting the new Diocese of Arlington, taking Northern Virginia from the Diocese of Richmond 
* Realigning the boundary between the Dioceses of Richmond and Wheeling to match the Virginia-West Virginia state line 
In 1977, Sullivan established a joint Catholic and Episcopalian parish, Holy Apostles in Virginia Beach The church had separate altars for the two denominations. That same year, he established the diocesan Commission on Sexual Minorities to reach out to LGBTQ+ Catholics.

=== 2000 to 2010 ===

The diocese was sued for defamation in July 2003 for $14 million by Carole Kahwajy. A principal of St. Benedict School in Richmond, the diocese had fired her in January 2002. Kahwajy said that diocesan officials had spread a story that she had covered up sexual abuse of boys at the school by Reverend John Hesch. She also claimed that diocese said she was sexually abusing boys at the school and had a sexual relationship with another priest. In 2003, after 33 years as bishop, Sullivan retired.

Pope John Paul II named Bishop Francis X. DiLorenzo of the Diocese of Honolulu as Sullivan&#x27;s replacement in 2004. Upon his installation, DiLorenzo reactivated the diocese&#x27;s liturgical commission to assert control over any statements or documents produced by clergy within the diocese. DiLorenzo in 2006 forcibly retired Reverend Thomas J. Quinlan, pastor of Holy Family Catholic Church in Virginia Beach for a history of using offensive language during mass. The situation had culminated with what DiLorenzo termed a sacrilegious reference to Mary, mother of Jesus, by Quinlan at a Christmas Eve mass.

DiLorenzo moved his residence from Cathedral Place in Richmond to Midlothian. Some Catholics raised questions about the move and see it as a way to distance himself from his flock. But DiLorenzo responded that he is only 25 minutes away from the diocesan offices and that the move saved the diocese money: &quot;Do I need to live in a three-story building by myself? I don&#x27;t think so.&quot; The three-story house was turned into offices for those working in a building that the diocese was renting for $35,000 a year. &quot;We saved ourselves thirty-some thousand a year,&quot; said DiLorenzo, &quot;and I moved to Midlothian, a very quiet place.&quot;

=== 2010 to present ===
In 2013, the diocese reported an increase in the number of seminarians preparing for the priesthood. According to Michael Boehling, the typical candidate was in his early to mid-20s, and was a college graduate with a degree in history, science or mathematics. &quot;They are articulate and bright, well-rounded individuals who are mature for their age,&quot;

A judge in 2016 dismissed a lawsuit filed by a former diocesan employee. The diocese had hired John Murphy to serve as executive director of Saint Francis Home in Richmond. The diocese fired him a week later after learning that he was in a same-sex marriage. Murphy asked for a dismissal after reaching a settlement with the diocese.

DiLorenzo ended the diocesan sexual minorities commission, which his predecessor had established in 1977. DiLorenzo increased the number of clustered parishes. He also brought in consultants to review some diocesan departments and commissions for dissolution. DiLorenzo retired in 2017. His replacement as bishop was Auxiliary Bishop Barry C. Knestout from the Archdiocese of Washington, appointed by Pope Francis in 2017

In January 2019, Knestout gave permission to the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia to use Saint Bede Catholic Church in Williamsburg for the ordination of Reverend Susan B. Haynes as its new bishop. The Episcopal diocese did not have a cathedral and usually rotated locations for its ordinations and other events. The announcement was met with opposition by some Catholics who objected to holding a non-Catholic worship service and the episcopal ordination of a woman in a Catholic church. Over 3,000 people signed an online petition condemning the action. Two days later, the Diocese of Southern Virginia announced it would celebrate Haynes&#x27; ordination elsewhere.

===Sexual abuse===
In March 1994, after the suicide death of a 21 year old man, his parents sent a request to the diocese that Reverend John Hesch not participate in the funeral mass. That request prompted an investigation by the diocese, which revealed allegations by the deceased man that Hesch had sexually molested him during the 1980s when he was a student at St. Benedict School. When Hesch returned from a trip to Europe in June 1994, Sullivan confronted him with the accusations. Later that day, Hesch committed suicide.

In July 1994, a former teacher at St. Benedict, Jacqueline M. Mishkel, said she and another teacher had reported Hesch to the diocese in 1985. Mishkel said that boys told her that during Hesch&#x27;s sex education classes, he had the boys feel his exposed penis. She said the diocese told her Hesch would be sent away for counseling, but nothing happened.

In April and August 1996, according to the 2023 Attorney General’s Report on Child Sexual Abuse in the Archdiocese of Baltimore, two men reported to the Diocese of Richmond that they had been sexually molested as young teenagers by Reverend John Bostwick III between 1980 and 1982. During trips with the boys, Bostwick fondled one boy&#x27;s genitals and tried the same with the second boy. Bishop Sullivan in November 1996 suspended Bostwick, then serving in Louisiana, and ordered him to attend a treatment facility, which Bostwick refused. Bostwick was never returned to ministry.

In February 2019, Knestout released a list of 42 priests with &quot;credible and substantiated&quot; accusations of sexual abuse against them. The list covered allegations from the 1950s to 1993. The liste included Bishop Carroll Dozier of the Diocese of Memphis, who was accused of committing acts of sex abuse while serving in the Diocese of Richmond.

In 2019, Knestout instructed Reverend Mark White to shut down his blog, under pain of removal from the priesthood. White had criticized the church hierarchy&#x27;s handling of the child sexual abuse crisis. His targets included former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, for whom Knestout had served as priest secretary, and Cardinal Donald Wuerl, with whom Knestout had worked as auxiliary bishop. In May 2020, Knestout removed White from his parish and trespassed him from the parish residence. Knestout ordered White to take up residence at a retreat center and undertake a ministry to prisoners. In June 2020, the Vatican denied White&#x27;s appeal of Knestout&#x27;s decree on technical grounds. In 2021, White said that Knestout was petitioning the Vatican to laicize him.

In October 2020, Richmond newspapers revealed that the diocese had paid $6.3 million to settle 51 out of 68 claims of sexual abuse. In July 2021, the diocese added four more names to its list of clergy with credible accusations of sexual abuse.

<doc id="854686" wikidata="Q744442" url="?curid=854686" title="Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard">
<text>Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard (; 13 September 1803 – 17 March 1847) was a prolific French illustrator and caricaturist who published under the pseudonym of Grandville (), and numerous variations (e. g. Jean-Jacques Grandville, Jean Ignace Isidore Grandville) throughout his career. Art historians and critics have called him &quot;the first star of French caricature&#x27;s great age&quot;, and described his illustrations as featuring &quot;elements of the symbolic, dreamlike, and incongruous&quot; while retaining a sense of social commentary, and &quot;the strangest and most pernicious transfigurement of the human shape ever produced by the Romantic imagination&quot;. The anthropomorphic vegetables and zoomorphic figures that populated his cartoons anticipated and influenced the work of generations of cartoonists and illustrators from John Tenniel, to Gustave Doré, to Félicien Rops, and Walt Disney. He has also been called a &quot;proto-surrealist&quot; and was greatly admired by André Breton and others in the movement.

Grandville was born in 1803, in Nancy, France into a family of artist and actors and received his earliest instruction in drawing from his father. He moved to Paris about 1823–1825 and began designing illustrations. His reputation was established in 1829 when he published a set of 70 lithographs titled &quot;Les Métamorphoses du jour&quot;. During the July Revolution of 1830 and the turbulent years that followed, he worked with Honoré Daumier and others producing provocative political cartoons for periodicals that were highly critical of the new monarchy of Louis Philippe I. After strict censorship laws were passed and threats from the police in 1835, Grandville turned to book illustration. He illustrated several classics such as La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables, Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, and Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. In later years his books were increasingly centered around his illustrations, with the text written for his images e.g. (1844), (1845), and (1846). Grandville typically made drawings for publishers that were later copied into lithographs and woodcuts by professional engravers, only occasionally did he make his own prints.

He married his cousin Marguerite Henriette Fischer in 1833 and they had three sons, but Marguerite and all three sons predeceased him, all on separate occasions. He remarried in 1843 to Catherine Marceline &quot;Céline&quot; Lhuillier and they had one son, Armand in 1845. Traditional accounts say that he went mad and died in an insane asylum; however, recent authors say that although the hospital where he died in Paris, Maison de Santé in Vanves, did treat the mentally ill among other illnesses, he was not &quot;mad&quot; and likely died of a throat infection, possibly diphtheria.

==Life==
===Early life: 1803–1830===

Jean Ignace Isidore Gerard, &quot;Grandville&quot;, was born on September 15, 1803, in Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, in northeastern France. His parents called him Adolphe, a name that originated from an older brother who had died three months before Grandville was born, and a name that followed him through the rest of his life. His father, Jean-Baptiste Gérard, was a noted painter of miniatures. He inherited his father&#x27;s talent and exhibited an aptitude for drawing at an early age. He received his earliest education in art from his father and several authors have noted his father&#x27;s influence on his draftsmanship and dense compositions, even in his mature work. Another painter of miniatures and lithographer, Léon-André Larue, called Mansion, was a relative who encouraged Grandville to go to Paris and learn lithography. Lithography had only recently been invented in Germany in the 1790s and was rapidly gaining popularity in Paris as a fast and cheap alternative to engraving and etching, for mass-producing prints and illustrated publications. In a period of social and political turmoil, inexpensive illustrated newspapers were coming into vogue, and opportunities for draftsmen and illustrators were also on the rise among the publishers and lithography studios in Paris at that time. Grandville was drawn to and influenced by the satirical prints, caricatures, and illustrations (often political) that were growing in popularity in France. Sources differ on the exact year and age, but after completing school, c. 1823–1825, Grandville moved to Paris and began pursuing a career in illustration and lithography. One account states his first lithograph titled &quot;La Marchande de cerises&quot; (&quot;The Cherry Seller&quot;), was published in Nancy 1824 or 1825.

Grandville&#x27;s parents had friends and family in Paris working in the theater who provided work and connections early on, including a relative, Frédéric Lemétheyer, who was a stage manager in the Opéra-Comique. He began using his pseudonym, &quot;Grandville&quot; in Paris. It was derived from &quot;Gérard de Grandville&quot;, his paternal grandparents stage name when they were actors and worked in the court of Lorraine. The pseudonym Grandville appeared in numerous variations throughout his career, including Grandville, Jean-Jacques Granville, J. J. Grandville, Jean Ignace Isidore Grandville, J. I. I. Grandville, Jean de Granville, and other variants. He designed illustrations for decks of playing cards and worked with Hippolyte Lecomte, a painter and ballet set designer in Paris, for whom he produced a set of color lithographs &#x27; in 1826. That set was followed by additional series including 12 lithographs created for the printer Langlumé titled (&quot;Sundays of a Paris Bourgeois&quot; or &quot;The Tribulations of Small Property&quot;), in 1826. Subsequent collections included 53 prints in &quot;La Sibylle des salons&quot; (&quot;The Sibyl of the Salons&quot;) in 1827 and 12 prints in &#x27; (&quot;Titles for Musical Pieces&quot;) in 1828.

Grandville lived a bohemian life in the late 1820s and early 1830s, renting in a small room on the upper floor of a building which is said to have been crowded with pens and papers where he drew incessantly. It became a gathering place for artist, writers, singers, lithographers and others. The painter Paul Delaroche was a neighbor during this period. Alexandre Dumas was among the milieu and later wrote of the time, &quot;If we had money, we had beer. If not, we were happy just to smoke, joke and argue.&quot; Grandville was described as a thin, somewhat quiet, and at times melancholy man, although Dumas noted he also had a sharp wit and a competitive side to him. It was in this period that he met the charismatic 28-year-old Charles Philipon, an editor and lithographer with the newspaper La Silhouette.

Grandville&#x27;s first real success was &#x27; (&quot;The Metamorphoses of the Day&quot;), a set of 70 color lithographs published in 1829. In this series, figures with human bodies but the heads of various animals, from fish to elephants, are depicted acting out a human comedy, perceptively satirizing the bourgeois of Paris and human nature in general. It established his reputation with the public and he was thereafter sought after as an illustrator by publishers and periodicals. In 1830 he published &#x27; (&quot;Voyage to Eternity&quot;), a series of nine lithographs in which death, in the form of a variously dressed skeleton, pays visits to a variety of Parisians, and is finally seen triumphantly leading a parade of young soldiers to their fate. Printing was stopped after only few copies were made due to the dark theme, which was possibly inspired by Thomas Rowlandson&#x27;s &quot;Dance of Death&quot;. However, it did succeed in gaining him more notoriety and the admiration of a few such as Champfleury and Honoré de Balzac.

===The French Revolution of 1830: 1830–1835===

In the French Revolution of 1830, the &quot;Three Glorious Days&quot; (July 27–29) saw the liberal, republican, working class of Paris fighting in the streets to bring down the Bourbon monarch Charles X, who was replaced by his more liberally minded cousin Louis Philippe I. These same republican workers were rapidly marginalized as the bourgeoisie appropriated the social, economic, and political gains of the revolution to their own ends. Alexandre Dumas is known to have fought with the workers and it is possible that Grandville and others in his circle participated in the fighting as well. Several satirical republican periodicals begin to emerge in Paris at this time, including La Silhouette, Tribune, &quot;La Caricature&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Artiste&quot;, &quot;Le Charivari&quot;, Corsaire, Réformateur, Bon Sens, Populaire, and others. These papers were often political, provocative, and pressed the issue that the workers had been pivotal in bringing Louis Philippe to power, but were now dismissed by the new monarchy.

The success of Grandville&#x27;s previous lithographic series led to invitations to design cartoons for these papers. The first of these was the satirical paper La Silhouette where his friend Charles Philipon was working as an editor. Grandville&#x27;s lithograph &quot;Let&#x27;s Put Out the Light and Rekindle the Fire!&quot; (&quot;the light&quot; of the Enlightenment and &quot;the fire&quot; of book-burning), criticizing censorship of the press, was published in June 1830 and quickly proscribed by the government. La Silhouette had a short run (December 1829 – January 1831), folding after the administration&#x27;s fines and pressure. It was only one in a succession of papers of similar content, many of which buckled under government pressure, and in some cases the same editors, writers, and illustrators moved from one paper to the next.

Before La Silhouette closed, Charles Philipon and Auguste Audibert founded La Caricature in 1830, with Honoré de Balzac as a literary editor and Grandville, Achille Devéria, Honoré Daumier, Edme Jean Pigal, Auguste Raffet, and Charles-Joseph Traviès de Villers as cartoonist and lithographers. As one author put it &quot;From 1830 to 1835 Philipon and La Caricature waged all-out war against Louis-Philippe.&quot; As part of this &quot;war&quot; Grandville designed numerous prints, including multi-part lithographs published over a period of weeks that collectors could piece together into one, e.g. the seven part &#x27; (&quot;The Great Crusade Against Liberty&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;The Hunters in Pursuit of Liberty&quot;). These attacks on monarchy were taken seriously and were not without consequences. Louis Philippe&#x27;s regime seized papers, levied fines, and sent editors, writers, and illustrators to prison. Daumier was fined 500 francs and spent six months in prison in 1832. Charles Philipon received even greater fines and longer prison terms as did other publishers. Grandville endured persistent harassment from the police, including searches, and one incident described as a mugging in his own building by thuggish policemen, foiled by a neighbor who confronted them with pistols. He is said to have been deeply distressed by these events. Grandville filed criminal charges asserting the police had entered his residence by force, and he later published a lithograph &quot;Oh!! Les vilaines mouches!!(Oh!! These nasty flies!! )&quot; Philipon organized L&#x27;Association Mensuelle lithographique which offered fine prints to its members in the early 1830s. Grandville produced over half the prints, with the profits going to pay the paper&#x27;s fines.

As La Caricature was collapsing, Philipon launched yet another review, Le Charivari in 1832, in which political attacks were more subtle, oblique, and veiled and the cartoons often addressed broader, less political, social satire. Grandville, Philipon, and Daumier, achieved a level of celebrity status among factions of the public, as much for their defiant opposition as their cartoons. His political cartoons enjoyed great popularity with the public and were held in high regard by many. Publishers and editors such as Edouard Charton of Le magasin pittoresque, as gave Grandville the freedom to choose his own subjects and create his images.

The business of caricaturing was financially tenuous. The papers typically paid cartoonists by the print and artist considered themselves lucky to receive a contract for drawing on a regular basis. Grandville had made his earlier lithographs himself, but after he started producing cartoons for the periodicals about 1831, he typically turned his original drawings over to publishers who had professional lithographers copy his images for printing. Color was sometimes added in colorist studios, almost always women, who applied watercolor or gouache by hand, following notes supplied by the artists.

The &quot;Fieschi attentat&quot;, an unsuccessful assassination attempt on King Louis Philippe occurred on July 28, 1835, the fifth anniversary of the July Revolution. The September Laws soon followed, with censorship of the press and significantly longer prison sentences for publishing criticisms of the king and his administration. Caricatures required approval from the government before they were published and the press was forbidden to report on trials involving the press.

Political lithographs (1830–1835)
===Later career: 1836–1847===

At the outbreak of the July Revolution of 1830, Grandville was a 26-year-old bachelor living a bohemian life. By the time the September Laws were passed in 1835, he was a 31-year-old husband, and a father. He quit producing political cartoons after the September Laws and turned to illustrating books. It has been postulated that he was relieved and even happy to leave the politics and police harassment behind at this point in his life. In July 1833 he married a cousin from Nancy, Marguerite Henriette Fischer and the couple maintained an apartment close to his studio, and rented a house near the outskirts of town. In 1834 their first son Ferdinand was born. A second son, Henri, was born in fall of 1838, but tragedy soon struck the family. Marguerite&#x27;s health is said to have declined with each birth and Ferdinand died of meningitis about the time Henri was born. In 1841 Henri choked to death on a piece of bread while his parents helplessly watched. A third son, Georges, was born in July 1842 but, Marguerite died of peritonitis later that month. Grandville remarried in October 1843 to Catherine Marceline Lhuillier (1819–1888) who was the mother of his fourth son Armand, born in 1845. One source states that from her deathbed, his first wife Marguerite, had a hand in selecting Catherine as a second wife and stepmother for her husband and son.

The first major undertaking in book illustration that Grandville undertook was a volume of song lyrics by the popular French songwriter Pierre-Jean de Béranger, first published with 38 wood engravings in 1835, and an expanded edition with 100 engravings in 1837. This was followed by several volumes of classic literature, including as &quot;La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables&quot;, Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot;, and Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. While his illustrations for classic prose include some fine, if conventional illustrations, they did not provide him with the opportunity to give free range to his imagination. He had a greater affinity for children&#x27;s literature, that shows in his illustration for La Fontaine Fables, and later the Fables of Lavalette and Florian, collectively ranking among his finest work. He made a series of drawings for Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; but these were not published.

Grandville adapted and refined his style in switching from cartoons to book illustrations, which coincided with the evolving printing technology and a shift from lithography to wood engraving. Previously, illustrations were typically printed on separate pages that were inserted into the text. With end-cut wood engravings, fine detail could be achieved on the hard end grain of wooden blocks, that could then be placed with the typographical blocks and printed on the same page with the text, lowering cost, and increasing the speed and quality of illustrated texts. Wood engravings also deteriorate less quickly than metal plates used for intaglio printing. Grandville did not engrave the wooden blocks himself. Typical of 19th century illustrators, he provided his original drawings to his publishers which were then carved by professional engravers for his book illustrations.

Book illustrations (after 1836) wood engravings
By the early 1840s, Grandville was increasingly illustrating books that were centered around his images. Working in collaboration with publishers and contemporary Parisian writers, he was at times given free regain of his imagination and the images. He produced about one book a year, his name often appearing before the authors on the title page, in which his illustrations were equally as important as the text, if not the main focus of the book. Not surprisingly some of his finest work and that for which he is best remembered today appeared in this period. Most of the authors he worked with had some past connections or background with the radical press of the early 1830s. The first was &quot;Scènes de la vie privée et publique des animaux&quot; (&quot;Scenes of the Private and Public Life of Animals&quot;), a satirical compilation of articles and short stories, first published in serial form over a couple of years, then in a two volume set in 1842, with 320 wood engravings by Grandville. Multiple authors contributed to the books including Honoré de Balzac, Louis-François L&#x27;Héritier, Alfred de Musset, Paul de Musset, Charles Nodier, and Louis Viardot.

This was followed by &quot;Petites misères de la vie humaine&quot; (&quot;Little Miseries of Human Life&quot;) in 1843, with text by , a contributor to Le Charivari who sometimes published under the pseudonym &quot;Old Nick&quot;. Old Nick also coauthored &quot;Cent proverbes: têxte par trois Tetes dans un bonnet&quot; (&quot;One Hundred Proverbs: Text by Three Heads in a Bonnet&quot;) with Taxile Delord and Louis Amédée Achard in 1845. provided the text for &quot;Un autre monde&quot; (&quot;Another World&quot;) in 1844, regarded by many as Grandville&#x27;s masterpiece and ironically the least successful volume in his lifetime. Delord, a writer and critic who was editor-in-chief of Le Charivari and later entered French politics, also wrote &quot;Les fleurs animées&quot; (&quot;Animated Flowers&quot; or &quot;Flowers Personified&quot;), completed in 1846 and published posthumously. &quot;Jérôme Paturot à la recherche d&#x27;une position sociale&quot; (&quot;Jérôme Paturot in Search of a Social Position&quot;), a social satire by Marie Roch Louis Reybaud published in 1846 and a great success, was the last book completed and published in his lifetime.

A romanticized myth emerged around Grandville&#x27;s death that persisted for 150 years or more. Traditional accounts asserted Grandville&#x27;s bizarre imagery was symptomatic of a disturbed mind, and the death of his family left him gray-haired and hunchbacked by the time he was forty, ultimately sending him over the edge into madness, and he died in an insane asylum. However, recent scholarship does not support this tale. In the days and weeks before his death Grandville was still producing some of his finest drawings, such as &quot;Crime and Expiation&quot;, and his correspondence with publishers reflect a clear and rational mind anticipating future projects. By all accounts the sudden illness and death of his third son George affected him deeply, some saying this occurred &quot;around late 1846 or early 1847&quot;, others place it only three days before his own death. On March 1, 1847, Grandville begin suffering from a sore throat and his condition progressively deteriorated over the following weeks. It has been speculated he had diphtheria. He was eventually taken to a private clinic, 8 Maison de Santé in Vanves, where Felix Voisin and Jean-Pierre Falret, two innovative psychiatrists worked. He died there on March 17, 1847 and was buried in the Cimetière Nord of Saint-Mandé of Paris next to his first wife and three sons. The artist wrote his own epitaph, translations vary: &quot;Here lies Grandville; he loved everything, made everything live, speak, and walk, but he could not make a way for himself.&quot; or &quot;Here lies J. J. Grandville. He could bring anything to life and, like God, he made it live, talk and walk. Only one thing eluded him: how to live a life of his own.&quot;

Though the designs of Grandville are occasionally unnatural and absurd, they usually display keen analysis of character and marvellous inventive ingenuity, and his humour is always tempered and refined by delicacy of sentiment and a vein of sober thoughtfulness.
Grandville&#x27;s ability for political provocation made his work much in demand. He worked in a wide variety of formats, from his first job illustrating the parlor game &quot;Old Maid&quot;, to illustrated newspaper strips of which he was a master. His illustrations for &quot;Le Diable à Paris&quot; (&quot;The Devil In Paris&quot;; 1844–1846) were used by Walter Benjamin for his study of that city as an urban organism. One of Grandville&#x27;s supreme achievements, at a time when French printing technology was ascendant, was &quot;Les Fleurs Animées&quot;, a series of images that are both poetic and satirical.

Perhaps his most original contribution to the illustrated book form was &quot;Un Autre Monde&quot;, which approaches the status of pure surrealism, despite being conceived in a pre-Freudian age. The full title of the book is, &quot;Un autre monde: Transformations, visions, incarnations, ascensions, locomotions, explorations, pérégrinations, excursions, stations, cosmogonies, fantasmagories, rêveries, folâtreries, facéties, lubies, métamorphoses, zoomorphoses, lithomorphoses, métempsycoses, apothéoses et autres choses&quot; (&quot;Another world: Transformations, visions, incarnations, ascents, locomotions, explorations, peregrinations, excursions, stations, cosmogonies, phantasmagoria, reveries, frolics, pranks, fads, metamorphoses, zoomorphoses, lithomorphoses, metempsychoses, apotheoses and other things&quot;).

Original drawings
==Legacy==
Alexandre Dumas wrote in his memoirs: &quot;Grandville had a delicate and sarcastic smile, eyes that sparkled with intelligence, a satirical mouth, short figure, large heart and a delightful tincture of melancholy perceptible everywhere — that is your portrait, dear Grandville!&quot; Interest in Grandville&#x27;s art remained relatively high for a few of decades after his death. His final works were published posthumously and several of his books were reissued in later editions and translated into other languages. Rue Grandville (48.83919°N, 2.42015°E), in the Saint-Mandé commune of Paris, is named in his honor. A monument with a by Ernest Bussière was erected in the Parc de la Pépinière in Nancy, France in 1893.

Théophile Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Portraits contemporains&quot; includes a short chapter on Grandville. Over 25 years after Grandville&#x27;s death, Gautier wrote that Grandville still enjoyed &quot;a popular reputation and whose drawings, caricatures, and illustrations are known to everyone&quot;. Although Gautier judged Grandville less a colorist than Daumier and less a poet than Tony Johannot, he stated, &quot;His original pen-and-ink drawings are exquisite in finesse, liveliness, and well rendered, and will gain in value year after year. We can ape Grandville, but will not equal it again.&quot;

Honoré de Balzac expressed ambivalent views of Grandville. He was an enthusiastic supporter and collector of Grandville&#x27;s early print series, and the two worked together at La Caricature in the early 1830s, where Balzac worked as an editor, and caricatures were an integral part of the newspaper. However in the 1840s, when publishers begin including illustrations in books, Balzac became more critical. He believed illustrations competed with the written word, distorted and diluted the text, and were undermining the market for novels, perhaps with some justification. Balzac contributed chapters to Grandville&#x27;s &quot;Scènes de la vie privée et publique des animaux&quot; (1842) which was one of the bestsellers of the 1840s, selling 25,000 copies, while Balzac&#x27;s first edition novels of the period were only selling 1,200–3,000 copies.

Charles Baudelaire, friend and champion of Honoré Daumier, was not a fan of Grandville. It seems odd that the author of &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; (&quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot;), with poems such as &quot;Spleen&quot;, and the great admirer and translator of Edgar Allan Poe, felt frightened by the images of Grandville. Today his criticisms read like an underhanded compliment.

 There are superficial people whom Grandville amuses, but as for me, he frightens me. When I enter into Grandville&#x27;s work, I feel a certain discomfort, like in an apartment where disorder is systematically organized, where bizarre cornices rest on the floor, where paintings seem distorted by an optic lens, where objects are deformed by being shoved together at odd angles, where furniture has its feet in the air, and where drawers push in instead of pulling out. Charles Baudelaire (1857)

His style and humour had a marked influence on John Tenniel and various other Punch-cartoonists.

The art historian H. W. Janson noted Grandville&#x27;s imagery anticipated various aspects of dada, surrealism, and pop art. Janson speculated if Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Tu m&quot;&#x27; (1918) could have been inspired by Grandville&#x27;s &quot;View of the Paris Salon&quot;, from &quot;Un autre monde&quot;, both of which involve subjects from the two dimensional surface of a painting emerging from the canvas into the real three dimensional space of the viewer. Janson asserted that Grandville&#x27;s illustration &quot;The Finger of God&quot;, also from &quot;Un autre monde&quot;, must have been familiar to pop artists producing large scale sculptures such as César Baldaccini&#x27;s &quot;Le pouce&quot; (&quot;The Thumb&quot;) in 1966. Grandville&#x27;s affinity with surrealism has been recognized since the 1930s. His work was included in the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s landmark exhibition &quot;Fantastic Art, Dada, and Sureealism&quot; in 1936. However, the art historian William Rubin pointed out the absence of any reference or recognition of Grandville by André Breton in his two manifestos of surrealism, or the other surrealists in the formative years of the movement in the 1920s. After a period of relative obscurity in the early 20th century, Grandville&#x27;s work became widely reproduced in the 1930s. Renewed interest in his work coincided with the rise of surrealism as a mainstream movement. It was apparently only in hindsight that André Breton, Georges Bataille, Max Ernst and others came to recognize Grandville as a significant precursor to the movement (but not an influence). Max Ernst was particularly enthusiastic about Grandville&#x27;s work and included him in a montage of 40 names, titled &quot;Max Ernst&#x27;s favorite poets and painters&quot;, originally published in View, 1941, alongside Bosch, Vinci, Shakespeare, Blake, Poe, Van Gogh, Chirico, and others. Ernst later made the frontispiece for a 1963 facsimile edition of &quot;Un autre monde&quot; with a caption reading &quot;A new world is born. All praise to Grandville.&quot;

British rock band Queen used part of his artwork for their 1991 album &quot;Innuendo&quot; and alternate pieces for most of the subsequent single releases: the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;I&#x27;m Going Slightly Mad&quot;, &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;. The video clip of &quot;Innuendo&quot; featured animated versions of the illustrations inspired by Grandville, and the single &quot;I&#x27;m Going Slightly Mad&quot; also featured one of this characters on the back of the sleeve and as the basis for a picture disc release.

American grunge band Alice in Chains used part of Grandville&#x27;s artwork for their self-titled 1995 album.

The graphic novel &quot;Grandville&quot; by Bryan Talbot was greatly inspired by Grandville&#x27;s illustrations.

Grandville&#x27;s art is used extensively in the video game &quot;Aviary Attorney&quot;, which is set during a fictionalized version of the French Revolution of 1848.

<text>The sociologist Max Weber formulated a three-component theory of stratification in which he defined party class as a group of people (part of a society) that can be differentiated on the basis of their affiliations with other engaged members in the political domain.

==Summary==

Unlike communities, where problems arise and are solved by those within the group, parties are formed when individuals seek out support beyond their immediate spatial environment. Status groups such as communities, or groups of individuals in similar class situations, become parties only when their means of mobilizing and assembling in pursuit of power becomes structured. A teachers&#x27; union is one example of a party drawn from a collective communal body. While the party may not represent the will of each individual member, it forms on the basis of rational collective interests and the assignment of outside individuals to protect those interests. For instance, when taxpayers in a geographic region mobilize to vote against support for allocation of resources to local schools, the teachers&#x27; union may enter the political realm to protect the interests of its members. These pursuits are thought to be rational in that they only represent the demands of the members insofar as they relate to the reason for that party&#x27;s congregation. While all members of the same union may support protection of local wildlife, those interests would be pursued via a separate party.

Unlike power formed on the basis of wealth or status, parties tend to most successfully aggregate and mobilize when their members represent a range of environments and social statuses. While a party&#x27;s objective may ultimately be the protection of financial capital or the status of its members, parties initially form to represent a range of group interests. A party&#x27;s political program represents both the key issues that party members decide on once congregated, and pull issues aimed at attracting members who share detached but similar interests. For instance, the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity may use political leverage to obtain funding from the local government, but the homebuilding it provides in low-income neighborhoods draws grassroots support for the organization&#x27;s efforts. While parties always seek to maintain political leverage, the local environment provides the human capital with which to mobilize those demands.

According to Weber, parties can form in unintended directions and pursue ends that are not initially part of their intended purpose. In &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;, Weber argued that the Protestant religion, initially formed as a spiritual institution, became the ethic that underlay the transition into capitalism. The initial pro-capitalist political parties that formed in Europe reflected the desire to prove success in spiritual life via the accumulation of capital, which became the pinnacle of &quot;worldly calling&quot;. As he argued of rationality in general, parties become the formally sanctioned, bureaucratic extension of emotional authority as society transitions into modernity. Parties form primarily in democratic societies because of the ideological differences that can arise between individuals in the same geographic region.

==Issues with party power==

As more contemporary theorists have noted, parties tend to become overburdened with demands as they grow larger and lose focus on initial key issues. One example, pursued by Doug McAdam in his writing &quot;Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency&quot;, was the Civil Rights Movement. Although the movement initially succeeded and made enormous social and political impact due to its rational and centered goals, the movement began to weaken throughout the 1970s due in part to irreconcilable views touted by its various leaders and sects.

<text>A Mars-crossing asteroid (MCA, also Mars-crosser, MC) is an asteroid whose orbit crosses that of Mars. Some Mars-crossers numbered below 100000 are listed here. They include the two numbered Mars trojans 5261 Eureka and .

Many databases, for instance the JPL Small-Body Database (JPL SBDB), only list asteroids with a perihelion greater than 1.3 AU as Mars-crossers. An asteroid with a perihelion less than this is classed as a near-Earth object even though it is crossing the orbit of Mars as well as crossing (or coming near to) that of Earth. Nevertheless, these objects are listed on this page. A grazer is an object with a perihelion below the aphelion of Mars (1.67 AU) but above the Martian perihelion (1.38 AU). The JPL SBDB lists 13,500 Mars-crossing asteroids. Only 18 MCAs are brighter than absolute magnitude (H) 12.5, which typically makes these asteroids with H&lt;12.5 more than 13 km in diameter depending on the albedo. The smallest known MCAs have an absolute magnitude (H) of around 24 and are typically less than 100 meters in diameter. There are over 21,600 known Mars-crossers of which only 5751 have received a MPC number.

Earth having more gravity and surface area than Mars attracts more impactors than Mars. Earth is impacted about 20 times more than the Moon, and Mars only gets impacted about 3 to 5 times more than the Moon.

<text>Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus is the thirteenth studio album by the Australian alternative rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 20 September 2004 on Mute Records. It is a double album of seventeen songs.

==History==
The album was produced by Nick Launay at Studio Ferber in Paris in March–April 2004 and Nick Cave used The Bad Seeds line up of Mick Harvey, Thomas Wydler, Martyn Casey, Conway Savage, Jim Sclavunos, Warren Ellis, and James Johnston. It was the first album by the group for which Blixa Bargeld did not perform – English guitarist and organist Johnston, of the group Gallon Drunk, replaced Bargeld. Cave decided to split drumming duties for the two parts, with Sclavunos on &quot;Abattoir Blues&quot; and Wydler on &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;. According to Launay, the whole album was completed in twelve days. The song &quot;Let the Bells Ring&quot;, was a posthumous tribute to Johnny Cash.

The album&#x27;s release was supported by the Abattoir Blues Tour, which travelled through Europe from 2 November to 5 December. In January 2007 a double live album and DVD was issued as &quot;The Abattoir Blues Tour&quot;. &quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;″s last track, &quot;O Children&quot;, was featured in the 2010 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;, and the song is referenced as an achievement in &quot;Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7&quot;. In March 2005, to complement the success of the double album, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot;, a three-disc, 56-track collection of B-sides, rarities, and tracks that had appeared on film soundtracks.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; holds a score of 88 out of 100 from Metacritic, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Susan Carpenter of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the album as &quot;a bounty of gothic rock&quot; and noted that &quot;the more driving, menacing numbers have been separated from the slow and scurrilous in a double album that is not two-halves of a whole so much as two distinct records released simultaneously and in one package.&quot; Thom Jurek of AllMusic described &quot;Abattoir Blues&quot; as &quot;a rock &amp; roll record... a pathos-drenched, volume-cranked rocker, full of crunch, punishment – and taste&quot; and &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; as &quot;a much quieter, more elegant affair... more consciously restrained, its attention to craft and theatrical flair more prevalent.&quot;. Greg Simpson of Punknews.org said that &quot;Abattoir Blues&quot; &quot;is very bluesy indeed, a rock and roll album with many angry songs and booming bass lines,&quot; while &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; &quot;insists on being a separate album, due to its completely different more gentle feel.&quot; Dan Lawrence of &quot;Stereogum&quot; ranked the album at fifth in their list of best albums in Cave&#x27;s discography, and described it musically as &quot;riotous gospel rock&quot;.

In a rave review, &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; critic Grigsby wrote that while &quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; &quot;may not be the best beginner&#x27;s guide&quot; to the band, for &quot;anyone who is a fan of the duration of his career, this album rewards the listener with a bit of the best of everything he has to offer.&quot; &quot;Paste&quot; said: &quot;Aside from the power of the music and lyrics, the set draws on Cave’s compelling persona: part priest, part sideshow barker--crooning one moment and eviscerating the next. While this has always been the core of his talent, on &quot;Abattoir/Lyre&quot; it is particularly rich and rewarding.&quot; In a more mixed assessment, Douglas Wolk, writing in &quot;Spin&quot;, was complimentary of &quot;Abattoir Blues&quot; but felt that &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; was &quot;effectively &quot;Abattoir&quot; spillover: more mellow, less grand in conception, but—somehow—more pretentious in execution.&quot; In his Consumer Guide for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau designated three songs from the album (&quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;, &quot;There She Goes, My Beautiful World&quot;, and &quot;Hiding All Away&quot;) as &quot;choice cuts&quot;, indicating good songs &quot;on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; the 180th best album of the 2000s. It was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Jules-Élie Delaunay (; June 13, 1828 – September 5, 1891) was a French academic painter.

==Biography==
He was born at Nantes in the Loire-Atlantique &quot;département&quot; of France. Delaunay studied under Flandrin, and at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris under Lamothe. He worked in the classicist manner of Ingres until, after winning the Prix de Rome, he went to Italy; in 1856, and abandoned the ideal of Raphaelesque perfection for the sincerity and severity of the quattrocentists.

After his return from Rome he was entrusted with many important commissions for decorative paintings, such as the frescoes in the church of St Nicholas at Nantes; the three panels of Apollo, Orpheus and Amphion at the Paris Opera house; and twelve paintings for the great hall of the council of state in the Palais Royal.

His &quot;Scenes from the Life of St Genevieve&quot;, which he designed for the Panthéon, remained unfinished at his death. The Musée d&#x27;Orsay has his famous &quot;Plague in Rome&quot; (shown at the Salon of 1869) and a nude figure of Diana; and the Nantes Museum, the &quot;Lesson on the Flute&quot;.

In the last decade of his life he achieved great popularity as a portrait painter. Among his subjects were his “Mother” and “Mademoiselle Toulmouche.”

He was awarded a first-class medal at the Paris Exposition of 1878, and the medal of honor in 1889. In 1878 he became an officer of the Legion of Honor, and the following year was made a member of the Institute. Jules-Élie Delaunay died in Paris in 1891.

<doc id="854706" wikidata="Q6243174" url="?curid=854706" title="John Kinsella (poet)">
<text>John Kinsella (born 1963) is an Australian poet, novelist, critic, essayist and editor. His writing is strongly influenced by landscape, and he espouses an &quot;international regionalism&quot; in his approach to place. He has also frequently worked in collaboration with other writers, artists and musicians.

==Early life and work==
Kinsella was born in Perth, Western Australia. His mother was a poet and he began writing poetry as a child. He cites Judith Wright among his early influences. Before becoming a full-time writer, teacher and editor he worked in a variety of places, including laboratories, a fertiliser factory and on farms.

==Later poetry and writing==
Kinsella has published at least fifty books and his many awards include three Western Australian Premier&#x27;s Book Awards, the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry, the John Bray Award for Poetry, the 2008 Christopher Brennan Award, the Victorian Premier&#x27;s Literary Award for Poetry, the Judith Wright Calanthe Award for poetry (twice) and the Australian Prime Minister&#x27;s Literary Award for Poetry.

His poems have appeared in journals such as &quot;Stand&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, &quot;Poetry Salzburg Review&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; and &quot;Antipodes&quot;. His poetry collections include: &quot;Poems 1980-1994&quot;, &quot;The Silo&quot;, &quot;The Undertow: New &amp; Selected Poems&quot;, &quot;Visitants&quot; (1999), &quot;Wheatlands&quot; (with Dorothy Hewett, 2000) and &quot;The Hierarchy of Sheep&quot; (2001). 
His book, &quot;Peripheral Light: New and Selected Poems&quot;, includes an introduction by Harold Bloom and his poetry collection, &quot;The New Arcadia&quot;, was published in June 2005. &quot;Drowning in Wheat: Selected Poems&quot; appeared in 2016, and &quot;Insomnia&quot; in 2019. After these came the first two volumes of his collected poems: &quot;The Ascension of Sheep&quot; (2021) and &quot;Harsh Hakea&quot; (2022).

Kinsella is a vegan and has written about the ethics of vegetarianism. He has published various books of autobiographical writing including &quot;Auto&quot; (2001) and &quot;Displaced: A Rural Life&quot; (2020). He has also written plays, short stories and the novels &quot;Genre&quot; and &quot;Post-colonial&quot;.

Kinsella taught at Cambridge University, where he is a Fellow of Churchill College. Previously, he was Professor of English at Kenyon College, United States, where he was the Richard L Thomas Professor of Creative Writing in 2001. He is emeritus Professor of Literature and Environment at Curtin
University and Visiting DAAD Professor in English at University of Tübingen, Germany.

Kinsella&#x27;s manuscripts are housed in the University of Western Australia, the National Library of Australia, the University of New South Wales, Kenyon College and the University of Leeds. The main collection is in Special Collections in the University of Western Australia Library.

Kinsella&#x27;s 2010 book, &quot;Activist Poetics: Anarchy in the Avon Valley&quot;, was published by Liverpool University Press and was edited by Niall Lucy.

==Work as an editor and critic==
Kinsella is a founding editor of the literary journal &quot;Salt&quot;, and was international editor of &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;. He co-edited a special issue on Australian poetry for the American journal &quot;Poetry&quot; and various other issues of international journals. He was a poetry critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; and is an editorial consultant for &quot;Westerly&quot;.

He is editor of the &quot;Penguin Anthology of Australian Poetry&quot; (2008), and co-editor with Tracy Ryan of the &quot;Fremantle Press Anthology of Western Australian Poetry&quot; (2017).

His critical works include the poetics of place trilogy, &quot;Disclosed Poetics: beyond landscape and lyricism&quot; (2007), &quot;Polysituatedness&quot; (2017)
and &quot;Beyond Ambiguity&quot; (2021). In these he posits his theory of
&quot;international regionalism&quot; and &quot;polysituatedness&quot;. The recent critical work &quot;Legibility: an anti-fascist poetics&quot; extends Kinsella&#x27;s
thinking around the intersections of pacifism, protest, human rights,
animal rights, environmentalism, anarchism, veganism and the role of poetry in resisting fascism.

<doc id="854707" wikidata="Q4530282" url="?curid=854707" title="List of ecoregions in India">
<text>Ecoregions of the world, spanning all land area (terrestrial) of the planet, were first defined and mapped in 2001 and subsequently revised in 2017. Later, freshwater ecoregions and marine ecoregions of the world were identified. Within India, there are 46 terrestrial ecoregions, 14 freshwater ecoregions, and 6 marine ecoregions.

==Terrestrial ecoregions==
The terrestrial ecoregions of the world include 45 ecoregions that fall entirely or partly within the boundaries of India. These ecoregions fall within two biogeographic realms: Indomalayan and Palearctic. They also fall under ten biomes: Deserts and Xeric Shrublands,  Flooded Grasslands and Savannas, Mangroves, Montane Grasslands and Shrublands, Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Temperate Conifer Forests, Tropical and Subtropical Coniferous Forests, Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests, Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands, and Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests. The ecoregion Rock and Ice is not included under any specific biome or biogeographic realm.
==Freshwater ecoregions==
Freshwater ecoregions of the world have been defined as &quot;a large area encompassing one or more freshwater systems with a distinct assemblage of natural freshwater communities and species. The freshwater species, dynamics, and environmental conditions within a given ecoregion are more similar to each other than to those of surrounding ecoregions, and together form a conservation unit.&quot; The following 14 freshwater ecoregions occur within India.
* Upper Indus
* Indus Himalayan Foothills
* Lower and Middle Indus
* Ganges Himalayan Foothills
* Middle Brahmaputra
* Chin Hills–Arakan Coast
* Ganges Delta and Plain
* Narmada–Tapti
* Northern Deccan Plateau
* Southern Deccan Plateau
* Southeastern Ghats
* Western Ghats
* Andaman Islands
* Nicobar Islands

==Marine ecoregions==
Marine ecoregions of the world have been described across the worlds oceans and seas. India&#x27;s seas are in the Western Indo-Pacific marine realm. This includes the following four provinces and six marine ecoregions. 
* West and South Indian Shelf province
** Western India
** South India and Sri Lanka
* Central Indian Ocean Islands province
** Maldives
* Bay of Bengal province
** Eastern India
** Northern Bay of Bengal
* Andaman province
** Andaman and Nicobar Islands

== Global 200 ecoregions in India ==

The following are the ecoregions in India that are included in the Global 200 ecoregions:

=== Terrestrial ===
* Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests (India)
* Eastern Deccan Plateau moist forests (old name) or East Deccan moist deciduous forests (current name) (India)
* Eastern Himalayan alpine meadows (Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal)
* Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests (Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal)
* Himalayan subtropical pine forests (Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan)
* Naga-Manipuri-Chin hills moist forests (India)
* Northeast India-Myanmar pine forests (India, Myanmar)
* Rann of Kutch seasonal salt marsh (India, Pakistan)
* South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests (India)
* Sundarbans mangroves (Bangladesh, India)
* Terai-Duar savannas and grasslands (Bhutan, India, Nepal)
* Tibetan Plateau alpine shrublands and meadows (Afghanistan, China, India, Pakistan, Tajikistan)
* Western Himalayan broadleaf forests (Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Pakistan)

<doc id="854712" wikidata="Q472235" url="?curid=854712" title="Hippolyte Flandrin">
<text>Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin (23 March 1809 – 21 March 1864) was a French Neoclassical painter. His most celebrated work, &quot;Jeune Homme Nu Assis au Bord de la Mer&quot; (1836) is held in the Louvre.

==Biography==
===Early life===
From an early age, Flandrin showed interest in the arts and a career as a painter. He was the second of three sons, all of whom were painters. Auguste, his older brother, spent most of his life as a professor at Lyon and later died there. Paul, his younger brother, was a painter of portraits and religious imagery.

Hippolyte and Paul spent some time at Lyon, saving to leave for Paris in 1829 and study under Louis Hersent. Eventually, they settled in the studio of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, who became not only their instructor but their friend for life. In 1832, he won the Prix de Rome for his painting &quot;Recognition of Theseus by his Father&quot;. This prestigious art scholarship meant that he was no longer limited by his poverty.

===Career===
The Prix de Rome allowed him to study for five years in Rome. While there, he created several paintings, increasing his celebrity both in France and Italy. His painting &quot;St. Clair Healing the Blind&quot; was created for the Nantes Cathedral, and years later, it also brought him a medal of the first class at the exhibition of 1855; this painting was destroyed in the fire which took place at Nantes Cathedral on 18 July 2020. &quot;Jesus and the Little Children&quot; was given by the government to the town of Lisieux. &quot;Dante and Virgil visiting the Envious Men struck with Blindness&quot; and &quot;Euripides writing his Tragedies&quot; are now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon.

In 1853, Flandrin was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts. On 4 April 1856, he assisted in the founding of the Œuvre des Écoles d&#x27;Orient, better known as L&#x27;Œuvre d&#x27;Orient; he was a member of its first general council on 25 April 1856. Upon his return to Paris in 1856, Flandrin received a commission from the chapel of St John in the church of St Séverin. As a result, his reputation became even more impressive, virtually guaranteeing him continuous employment for the rest of his life.

In addition to these works, Flandrin also painted a great number of portraits, including &quot;Portrait of Napoleon III&quot;, who was not very well received by the sitter. However, he is much more known today for his monumental decorative paintings. The most notable of these are found in the following locations:

* in the sanctuary, choir, and nave of St Germain des Prés at Paris (1842–1861)
* in the church of St Paul at Nîmes (1848–1849)
* of St Vincent de Paul at Paris (1850–1854)
* in the church of St-Martin-d&#x27;Ainay at Lyon (1855)

===Personal life and death===
In 1843 Flandrin married Aimée-Caroline Ancelot (1822–1882). Their son Paul Hippolyte Flandrin (1856–1921) became a painter of sacred art, portraitist and decorator.

In 1863, Flandrin&#x27;s failing health, made worse by his hard work and extended exposure to the damp and draughts of churches, induced him to visit Italy again, where he died of smallpox in Rome on 21 March 1864.

<doc id="854719" wikidata="Q885671" url="?curid=854719" title="Buford Ellington">
<text>Earl Buford Ellington (June 27, 1907 – April 3, 1972) was an American politician who served as the 42nd governor of Tennessee from 1959 to 1963, and again from 1967 to 1971. Along with his political ally, Frank G. Clement, he helped lead a political machine that controlled the governor&#x27;s office for 18 years, from 1953 to 1971.

Ellington was a supporter of President Lyndon B. Johnson; he was appointed in 1965 as the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning during the Johnson Administration.

==Early life and career==

Ellington was born in Holmes County, Mississippi, the son of Abner and Cora (Grantham) Ellington. He studied religion at Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi, but had to drop out due to financial difficulties. He edited a newspaper in Durant, Mississippi, for a brief period.

In 1929, he married Catherine Ann Cheek, and moved to her native Marshall County, Tennessee, in the south central part of the state. There he bought a store in the Verona community. He worked as a salesman for American Harvester in the 1930s, and was a supervising salesman with Tennessee Farm Bureau Insurance in the early 1940s.

Having joined the Democratic Party, in 1944, Ellington worked in the campaign of successful gubernatorial candidate, Jim Nance McCord. Two years later, he was the Marshall County manager for the campaign of US Congressman Joe L. Evins. In 1948, Ellington ran and was elected to Marshall County&#x27;s seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives.

In 1952, Ellington managed the successful campaign of Frank Clement, who defeated incumbent Gordon Browning in the Democratic primary for governor, and went on to win the general election. Clement&#x27;s campaign had the support of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump, who was seeking to regain the influence he had lost after Browning defeated his candidate, McCord, four years earlier. Clement appointed Ellington as Commissioner of Agriculture, where he served until the late 1950s under more than one administration.

==Governor==

In 1953, the Tennessee State Constitution was amended, extending the gubernatorial term from two years to four years. The new amendments prevented governors from serving consecutive terms, but a temporary exception was made for Clement. He was elected to a full four-year term in 1954 after his initial two-year term.

In 1958, with Clement term-limited, Ellington sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for governor. His opponents were Memphis mayor Edmund Orgill, Nashville attorney Clifford Allen, and Judge Andrew &quot;Tip&quot; Taylor. Since Crump&#x27;s death in 1954, the Clement-Ellington alliance had become the state&#x27;s leading political organization. Ellington won the nomination with 213,415 votes to 204,629 for Taylor, 204,382 for Orgill, and 56,854 for Allen. He won the general election by a sizeable margin over several opponents, among them former Governor McCord, who ran as an independent.

During his first term, Ellington continued many of Clement&#x27;s policies. Aided by an economic boom, he could approve raises for public school teachers and school administrators without increasing taxes. While he supported continued legal segregation, he ordered the state to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional; it ordered desegregation of the public school system.

In 1961, several Tennessee State University students who had participated in the Freedom Rides, to highlight illegal segregation on interstates buses, which were covered by federal law, were expelled after Ellington ordered an investigation into their activities. In response, dozens of protesters picketed the state capitol and demanded a meeting with Ellington, but he refused.

At the 1960 Democratic National Convention, a rift had begun to form in the relationship between Clement and Ellington. The former endorsed John F. Kennedy for president, and the latter endorsed Lyndon B. Johnson.

Following his first term as governor, which ended in 1963, Ellington returned to the private sector, working as a vice president of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Vice President Lyndon Johnson succeeded Kennedy to the presidency after he was assassinated in Dallas in November 1963.

In early 1965, President Johnson appointed Ellington as Director of the Office of Emergency Planning (later integrated into FEMA). During the Selma to Montgomery marches, which took place at the height of the civil rights movement in March of that year, Ellington played a key role in establishing contact and talks between President Johnson and Governor George Wallace of Alabama. The state provided protection for marchers in the last march. In September, Ellington helped organize federal relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Betsy.

Ellington again sought the Democratic Party nomination for governor in 1966. His opponent, John Jay Hooker, was a friend of former Governor Browning, and had been endorsed by the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;. Ellington was endorsed by President Johnson, Clement, and the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;. He defeated Hooker for the nomination, 413,950 votes to 360,105. The divide between Clement and Ellington continued to grow, as Ellington refused to endorse Clement in his US Senate primary campaign against Ross Bass. Governor Clement attempted to spend the state&#x27;s budget surplus to ensure the Ellington administration did not inherit it.

Ellington won the general gubernatorial election in 1966. By this time, he had shifted his position on segregation, and openly supported an end to the long-standing practice. In 1967, he appointed African American Hosea T. Lockard to his cabinet as administrative assistant; he was the first black cabinet member in state history. On April 4, 1968, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis led Ellington to immediately mobilize the National Guard, to prevent rioting in the city.

In September 1967, Ellington signed a bill repealing the Butler Act, the 1925 law that had outlawed the teaching of the Theory of Evolution in state schools.

==Later life==

Ellington did not seek another office after his second term as governor ended. In the 1970 gubernatorial campaign, he refused to endorse the Democratic nominee, John Jay Hooker, and quietly supported the Republican nominee (and eventual winner), Winfield Dunn. Ellington&#x27;s press secretary, Hudley Crockett, was narrowly defeated by incumbent Albert Gore Sr., in the 1970 U.S. Senate primary.

Ellington died while playing golf in Boca Raton, Florida, on April 3, 1972. Former President Johnson and Vice President Spiro Agnew were among those who attended his funeral, and President Richard Nixon issued a statement of condolence.

==Family and legacy==

Ellington married Catherine Ann Cheek in 1929. They had two children: John, who became a pilot and aviation expert, and Ann, who became an artist.

*The Ellington Agricultural Center, the headquarters of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, is named in honor of Governor Ellington. 
*A golf course at Henry Horton State Park and buildings on the campuses of Tennessee Technological University, the University of Memphis, and the University of Tennessee at Martin were also named in his honor.
*The Financial Aid and Registrar building on the campus of Austin Peay State University is named in Ellington&#x27;s honor.

<text>Louis Hersent (10 March 1777 – 2 October 1860) was a French painter.

== Life and career ==
He was born in Paris. He became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David, and obtained the in 1797. In the Salon of 1802, he showed &quot;Metamorphosis of Narcissus&quot;, and he continued to exhibit with rare interruptions up to the Salon of 1831. He married Louise-Marie-Jeanne Mauduit in 1821.

His pupils were Louis-Eugène Bertier, Auguste Bigand, Hélène Charlotte Juliette de Bourge, Augustin Luc Demoussy, Henri Joseph Constant Dutilleux, Hippolyte Dominique Holfeld, Jean-Francois-Hyacinthe-Jules Laure, Eugène Modeste Edmond Lepoittevin, Emile Aubert Lessore, Auguste Dominique Mennessier, François Alexandre Pernot, Julie Philipault, August Thomas Pierre Philippe, Pierre Poterlet, Joachim Sotta, Henry de Triqueti, and Théophile Auguste Vauchelet.
His most considerable works under the First French Empire were &quot;Achilles parting from Briseis&quot;, and &quot;Atala dying in the arms of Chactas&quot; (both engraved in Landon&#x27;s &quot;Annales du Musée&quot;); an &quot;Incident of the life of Fénelon&quot;, painted in 1810, found a place at Malmaison, and &quot;Passage of the Bridge at Landshut&quot;, which belongs to the same date, is now at Versailles.

Hersent&#x27;s typical works, however, belong to the period of the Restoration; &quot;Louis XVI relieving the Afflicted&quot; (Versailles) and &quot;Daphnis and Chloë&quot; (engraved by Laugier and by Gelée) were both in the Salon of 1817; at that of 1819 the &quot;Abdication of Gustavus Vasa&quot; brought to Hersent a medal of honour, but the picture, purchased by the Duke of Orléans, was destroyed at the Palais-Royal in 1848, and the engraving by Henriquel-Dupont is now its sole record. &quot;Ruth&quot;, produced in 1822, became the property of Louis XVIII, who from the moment that Hersent rallied to the Restoration patronized him, made him officer of the Legion of Honour, and pressed his claims at the Institut de France (Académie des Beaux-Arts), where he replaced van Spaendonck.

He continued in favour under Charles X, for whom was executed &quot;Monks of Mount St Gotthard&quot;, exhibited in 1824. In 1831, Hersent made his last appearance at the Salon with portraits of Louis Philippe, Marie Amélie and the duke of Montpensier; that of the kingwas not considered by the anonymous author in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition as equal to the portrait of Spontini (Berlin), which the author considered probably Hersent&#x27;s &quot;chef-d&#x27;œuvre&quot;.

After this date, Hersent ceased to exhibit at the yearly salons. Although in 1846 he sent a likeness of Delphine Gay and one or two other works to the rooms of the Société d&#x27;Artistes, he could not be tempted from his usual reserve even by the international contest of 1855.

<text>Glan, officially the Municipality of Glan (; , Jawi: ايڠد نوڠلن; ), is a municipality in the province of Sarangani, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 109,547 people.

Glan is the most populous municipality in Sarangani and it is located east of Sarangani Bay, west of Davao Occidental, and north of the Celebes Sea. Barangay Sufatubo as the largest barangay in Glan, It is largely based on agriculture with a high level production of copra. Aquaculture is the second biggest income earner, notably milkfish and shrimps culture. Other agricultural products are coconuts, maize, sugarcane, bananas, pineapples, mangoes, pork, eggs, beef, and fish.

The economy accelerated in 2010s due to advances in global communication technology and the finishing of a modern highway, which improved trade and transport. The municipality is classified as he &quot;heritage town&quot; by cultural conservationists, including members of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts due to the many well-preserved ancestral houses and heritage structures within the municipality. The Heritage Conservation Society suggested an ordinance, similar to the ordinance in Vigan, that would protect Glan&#x27;s heritage houses and aesthetics in 2014 for centuries to come. Some conservationists have also suggested for the town&#x27;s inclusion in the Philippines tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site enlistment.

==History==

In the early efforts of Independence from American administration, Sergio Osmeña, Sr. the president of the first convention of provincial governors had joined those nationalists who petitioned Governor William Howard Taft to allow the formation of a political party advocating immediate independence for the Philippines in 1902. Sergio Osmeña, while a governor of Cebu, he was elected as the first Speaker of national assembly in 1907 and uses the venue to request further more Filipino control in the colony or “Filipinization” of the colony. From 1907 to 1916, the executive power of the Philippines was vested in an American Governor General, assisted by the departmental secretaries. Under the Osmeña Act, which passed by the Philippine Legislature a portion of this act “which provides the colonization to all parts of Mindanao that includes Jolo, Sulo and Basilan.” Hence, the distribution of land in Mindanao, program by the Bureau of Land “Free” otherwise known as “Homestead”, comprises twenty four (24) hectares track of agricultural land in addition to townsite lot of nine hundred twenty (920) square meters to give free and distributed to Filipino families from all walks of life from Luzon and Visayas willing to owned and occupy land in Mindanao. Hence, this was known as sakada people migrated to Mindanao by way of shipment from Luzon and other parts of the Visayas.

In 1912, arriving at the port of Surigao where the office of the bureau of land under American supervision. A noticed outside the office which read “Immediate Hiring of Workers” and willing to travel to all parts of Mindanao. Thus, Elpidio Empasis Barcelona, a very poor young Spanish Filipino mestizo hails from Tanke, Talisay in island of Cebu at the age of sixteen (16) became an employee of the Bureau of Land, under an American supervision in Land Survey Party. He works as a “transit man” and was designated as an assistant to the Engineering Land Surveyor due to his knowledge in mathematics. Experienced in surveying, his first assignment was from Butuan, Davao, and others parts of Cotabato, Pikit, Pagalungan, Midsayap as far as Zamboanga, Jolo, Sulo and Basilan. Also in 1912, back to area of Cotabato member of survey party led by an American geodetic engineer, continued their task of surveying, until they reached the most southern part of Cotabato, now called “GLAN”, which was then unexplored before. The existence of the biggest form of trees with approximate diameter of five to six feet, the least was four feet in diameter. There were very few existing houses of Blaans and Maguindanaons, who were native inhabitants in the area, numbered not more than seven houses or shanties near the banks of the river, and there were also others who lived in shanties at the hinterland. They found no Christians alike, the place was still unknown its name. A member of the survey party, approached a certain native Maguindanaon man who happened sharpening his long bladed bolo, and asked the native in Cebuano, “amigo, unsay nga’an ning dapita, ning lugaraha?” (Friend, what&#x27;s the name of this area, this place?). The man did not actually understand Cebuano, as he thought the stranger was asking what he was doing he answered “GALANG” means sharpening in Maguindanaon. Then and there, the member of the survey party reported to Barcelona the name of the place is “Galang”. By mistake, it was named in the surveyed place and was established in the department of agriculture in a lot plan as “Colony No. 9- Glan”. The man was later known as Po Mangalaw.

Elpidio Empasis Barcelona made a written request to his American supervisor and recommended to the Bureau of Land Secretary to be reassigned in Cotabato colony no. 9 to assist SACADA people from Visayas in filing their free-patent application, relative to distribution and location of their homestead and also with corresponding lot number. Barcelona request&#x27;s was granted. On ground that this new unexplored land (Colony No. 9) must be distributed to people Christians alike and also includes the native Blaans and Maguindanaons.

Barcelona wrote a letter to his families back in Carcar, Cebu, inviting them and their neighbors to come and the people from San Fernando, Naga, and other parts of Cebu joined in going to a place now called Glan. These people from Carcar and neighboring towns in Cebu decided themselves by majority to charter another ship, that directly to land at its seashores at the valley of Glan. The arrival of first ship landed was on October 8, 1914. They were Fermin Adarna, Braulio Jimenez, Gavino Avila, Severino Maribosa, Esperidion Cania, Agapito Morales, Perpetuo Cellona, Luis Onin, Macario Ebona, Mamerto Del Pilar, Bernabe Flores, Jose Sarcon, Felipe Onay, Tomas Ugdamin, Damaso Intig and Eulogio Villaluz.

The second wave of southward arrival was on March 10, 1915. They were Gil Alcober, Gonzalo Cabilao, Primo Alcoriza, Braulio Calinawan, Baldomero Alducente, Gil Caliza, Gaspar Alido, Mateo Du, Urbano Alinsunurin, Felipe De Goma, Macario Alinsugay, Anatalio Flores, Graciano Algarme, Eusebio Lapis, Maximo Baclaan, Clemente Pangalao, Andres Barcelona, Eugenio Pangalao, Enrique Barcelona, Higino Paras, Arcadio Baring, Miguel Reyes, Francisco Bendigoza, Hospicio Sarmiento, Marcelo Bukog, Timoteo Sarmiento, Mariano Alinsugay and Gavino Tabanao.

These were the first Sacadas who built the town Glan. Later, Tranquilino Ruiz was assigned as Colony Supervisor around 1917 in Glan.

===Heritage Town===
The municipality is classified by members of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as a heritage town. However, no ordinance or law has yet to be legislated for protection of Glan&#x27;s heritage structures and colonial roads. A Vigan-type ordinance has been suggested by the Heritage Conservation Society, so that the town may be added to the Philippines UNESCO Tentative List in the future.

<doc id="854727" wikidata="Q1058330" url="?curid=854727" title="Militsiya">
<text>Militsiya (, ) were the police forces in the Soviet Union until 1991, in several Eastern Bloc countries (1945–1992), and in the non-aligned SFR Yugoslavia (1945–1992). The term &quot;Militsiya&quot; continues to be used in common and sometimes official usage in some of the individual former Soviet republics such as Belarus, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as in the partially recognised or unrecognised republics of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. In Russian law enforcement, the term remained in official usage until the police reform of 2011.

==Name and status==
The name &quot;militsiya&quot; as applied to police forces originates from a Russian Provisional Government decree dated April 17, 1917, and from early Soviet history: both the Provisional Government and the Bolsheviks intended to associate their new law-enforcement authority with the self-organisation of the people and to distinguish it from the czarist police. The militsiya was reaffirmed in Russia on October 28 (November 10, according to the new style dating), 1917 under the official name of the &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Militsiya&quot;, in further contrast to what the Bolsheviks called the &quot;bourgeois class protecting&quot; police. Eventually, it was replaced by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russian: МВД, &quot;MVD&quot;; Ukrainian: МВС, &quot;MVS&quot;; Belarusian: МУС, &quot;MUS&quot;), which is now the official full name for the militsiya forces in the respective countries. Its regional branches are officially called Departments of Internal Affairs—city department of internal affairs, &quot;raion&quot; department of internal affairs, &quot;oblast&quot; department of internal affairs, etc. (The Russian term for a &quot;raion&quot; department is OVD (ОВД; Отдел/Отделение внутренних дел, &quot;Otdel/Otdeleniye vnutrennikh del&quot;), for region department is UVD (УВД; Управление внутренних дел, &quot;Upravleniye vnutrennikh del&quot;) or, sometimes, GUVD (ГУВД; Главное управление внутренних дел, &quot;Glavnoye upravleniye vnutrennikh del&quot;), same for national republics is MVD, (МВД; Министерство внутренних дел, &quot;Ministerstvo vnutrennikh del&quot;).)

Functionally, Ministries of Internal Affairs are mostly police agencies. Their functions and organisation differ significantly from similarly named departments in Western countries, which are usually civil executive bodies headed by politicians and responsible for many other tasks as well as the supervision of law enforcement. The Soviet and successor MVDs have usually been headed by a militsiya general and predominantly consist of service personnel, with civilian employees only filling auxiliary posts. Although such ministers are members of their respective countries&#x27; cabinets, they usually do not report to the prime minister or parliament, but only to the president. Local militsiya departments are subordinated to their regional departments, having little accountability to local authorities.

Internal-affairs units within the militsiya itself are usually called &quot;internal security&quot; departments.

The official names of particular militsiya bodies and services in post-Soviet countries are usually very complicated, hence the use of the short term &quot;militsiya&quot;. Laws usually refer to police just as &quot;militsiya&quot;.

The short term for a police officer (regardless of gender) is &quot;militsioner&quot; (Russian: &quot;милиционер&quot;, Ukrainian: &quot;мiлiцiонер&quot;). Slang Russian terms for &quot;militsioner&quot; include &quot;ment&quot; (plural: менты, &quot;menty&quot;) and &quot;musor&quot; (plural: &quot;мусора&quot;, &quot;musora&quot;). Although the latter word is offensive (it literally means &quot;trash&quot; or &quot;garbage&quot;), it originated from an acronym for the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department (, short for ) in Imperial Russia. &quot;Ment&quot; is a close equivalent to the English slang term &quot;cop&quot; and derived from the Lwów dialect of Polish
or possibly from the Polish word &quot;menda&quot;.

The following countries have changed the name of the police force from &quot;Militsiya&quot; (or equivalent) to a western-style name analogous to &quot;police&quot;: Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Estonia, Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, Mongolia, North Macedonia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Russia and Ukraine.

In 2019, Uzbekistan officially removed references to the word &quot;Militsiya&quot; from its laws without replacing them with &quot;police&quot;.

The police are still called &quot;militsiya&quot; in Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, as well as in the unrecognized republics of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. In Kyrgyzstan active discussion continues about renaming the police force from &quot;militsiya&quot; to &quot;police&quot;.

==General overview==

The organizational structure, methods and traditions of the militsiya differ significantly from those of western police. Militsiya as an organisation consists of many functional departments, such as the GIBDD, a traffic police. Organised crime detectives form highly independent squads inside regional militsiya. Some units may have the distinctive names (like OMON in Russia) which are more specific than &quot;militsiya&quot; or &quot;militsioner&quot;.

Militsiya personnel ranks mostly follow those of the Army – from private (Russian: &quot;ryadovoy&quot;), which is the lowest rank, to colonel general – with only these exceptions: there are no ranks of Yefreytor, Army General, or Marshal. Detectives (Russian: &quot;operativnik&quot; (оперативник), &quot;operative&quot;, short for &quot;operative employee&quot; – &quot;operativniy rabotnik&quot; (оперативный работник)) hold a rank of at least lieutenant, and could be promoted to major or colonel. The militsiya of an oblast (or other equivalent subnational entity) is usually headed by a general. The rank name is suffixed with &quot;of militsiya&quot; (e.g. &quot;major of militsiya&quot; for a major). Militsiya personnel carry firearms, but are not permitted to carry their weapons when they are off duty.

Unlike in some other countries&#x27; police agencies, militsioners are not assigned permanent partners, but work alone or within larger groups. Neither uniformed officers nor detectives are allowed to drive police vehicles themselves, so a specialist driver (either a serviceman or a civil employee) is assigned to each car and is also in charge of its maintenance. Under the Patrol Police Service Regulations a designated police officer-driver is required to have a driver licence and is not allowed to abandon the vehicle. However, this refers only to fully marked police vehicles with emergency lights; detectives are allowed to drive civilian cars with are registered to the MVD, having white number plates (marked police vehicles have blue plates) with specific series (for example, &quot;o...vo&quot;, &quot;o...rr&quot;, &quot;o...mm&quot;, &quot;o...om&quot;). The last two are usually assigned to the vehicles registered to regional level MVD units. The law does not provide any preferences on the road nor allows emergency lights and/or sirens on such vehicles, therefore technically police officers do not have the right to violate traffic laws even while on an assignment. GIBDD (the traffic militsiya) is the only exception: its members drive their own (or even own private) cars and are specially trained in risk-driving.

One unique feature of militsiya policing approach is the system of territorial patronage over citizens. The cities, as well as the rural settlements are divided into &quot;uchastoks&quot; (, &quot;quarters&quot;) with a special &quot;uchastkovyi&quot; militsioner (&quot;quarter policeman&quot;), assigned to each. The main duty of &quot;uchastkovyi&quot; is to maintain close relations with the residents of his quarter and gather information among them. In particular, &quot;uchastkovyi&quot; should personally know each and every ex-convict, substance abuser, young hooligan etc. in given &quot;uchastok&quot;, and visit them regularly for preemptive influence. &quot;Uchastkovyi&quot; is also responsible for tackling minor offences like family violence, loud noise, residential area parking etc. &quot;Uchastkovyi&quot; is also the main, and actually the real, militsiya force in remote areas and small settlements where permanent police departments are not created. &quot;Uchastkovyi&quot; militsioners possess separate small offices within their quarters and maintain citizens admittance in definite weekdays.

This system slightly resembles the US system of sheriffs but shows some notable differences. &quot;Uchastkovyi&quot; is neither a chief police officer in a given community nor a universal one (not combining detective, incarceration or special tactics tasks).

The system of &quot;uchastkovyis&quot; dates back to imperial times when &quot;uriadniks&quot; were conducting lowest-level policing in rural areas. In Soviet Union, &quot;uchastkovyis&quot; were also responsible for such tasks as maintaining propiska limitations and overseeing former political prisoners, which were subject to daily registration at the local MVD office.

Although women constitute a significant proportion of militsiya staff, they are usually not permitted to fill positions that carry risks (such as patrolman, guard, SWAT), but are allowed to carry firearms for self-defence. Instead, they are widely represented among investigators, juvenile crime inspectors, clerks, etc. However, limited attempts are being made to appoint women as traffic officers or &quot;operativniks&quot;.

===Conscripted police===


Another unique militsiya feature is the use of conscripted soldiers from the Internal Troops and special motorized militsiya units (&quot;СМЧМ&quot;, SMChM) for regular urban policing and for securing various mass events, which required more force employment than usual. The Internal Troops and SMChMs are the gendarmerie-like military force who can be assigned to carry out simple public security tasks like patrolling while being accompanied by professional militsioners, or cordoning large crowds at sport events, concerts, and protests. These soldiers possess no firearms on their policing duties, however they are equipped with PR-73 rubber police batons, PR-90 tonfas and related equipment; when called to perform riot control duties, they are typically equipped with ballistic shields and tear gas. The SMChM soldiers typically wear grey militsiya uniforms, distinguished from commissioned officers by wearing standard-issued sapogi instead of individual boots or shoes, the Internal Troops wear green military uniform. During emergencies, raids, dragnets and other police operations, they are equipped with bullet-proof vests and protective gear, firearms and armoured vehicles while performing their policing duties.

While not on law enforcement duty, soldiers reside in barracks and maintain standard military training. Special motorised militsiya units stationed in the cities were all battalions with three exceptions. Kyiv and Leningrad had regiments and Moscow had a division, known as ODON, which is frequently used for policing Moscow; its soldiers can be spotted by a shoulder patch which features a white panther; other Internal troops units in the Moscow region use a shoulder patch with a white falcon.

===Rank insignia===
Until late 1936, the People&#x27;s Militsiya and Internal Troops of the NKVD had no personal ranks, much akin to the Red Army, Red Navy, and OGPU, and used position ranks. When personal ranks were reintroduced in the military in 1935, the Militsiya created a curious rank system that was a blend of standard military ranks such as sergeant, lieutenant, captain and major, and old positional ranks like &#x27;squad leader&#x27;, &#x27;inspector&#x27;, and &#x27;director&#x27;, some with several grades like &#x27;senior&#x27; or &#x27;junior&#x27;. The collar rank insignia was completely original and not based on military insignia.

This system was largely reused by the GUGB in their special rank structure introduced in 1935, although with new rank insignia and Commissar-style ranks for top officers.

New insignia were issued to GUGB in 1937 and to Militsiya in 1939. It was now based on collar rank patches of the Red Army and Internal Troops. Confusingly, the special NKVD rank system was left intact, so for example &quot;&#x27;Captain of Militsiya/State Security&quot; was assigned the three-box insignia of an army Colonel (in the Red Army, this patch was reassigned to lieutenant colonel in September 1939, but the NKVD did not alter their insignia) and &quot;Major of Militsiya/State Security&quot; was mapped to one-romb insignia of &quot;Kombrig&quot; (a brigade commander) (which was abolished for commanding officers of the Red Army in May 1940). This created a great deal of inconsistency and tension between army and NKVD/NKGB officers.

The NKVD rank system was streamlined in 1943 when imperial-style shoulder boards replaced the collar insignia patches. The ranks now copied those of the Soviet Army, with the exception of top officers starting with &#x27;Senior Major&#x27; who were renamed Commissar of Militsiya 3rd, 2nd, and 1st rank, although they still wore army-style Major General, Lieutenant General and Colonel General shoulder boards.

The GUGB/NKGB maintained their commissar ranks until 1945, and switched to equivalent General ranks after that. The Militsiya retained the commissar ranks until 1973.

Some MVD officers had distinct ranks of General of the Internal Service of 1st, 2nd and 3rd rank; they were replaced with Major General, Lieutenant General and Colonel General in the 1970s.

Ranks of militsiya are considered special ranks, not to be confused with military (all-forces) ranks, which are used by the internal troops of the MVD. All militsiya ranks have had the words &quot;of militsiya&quot; at the end, which are part of the rank name and not a descriptive addition.

==Non-police services==
The Soviet and some post-Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs have also included:

*Militarized forces (Internal Troops);
*Department of prisons (i.e. Gulag and its successor bodies), if not merged with other ministries or agencies;
*Passport and registration service, if not merged with Migration service.

These non-police services should be distinguished from the &quot;militsiya&quot; itself, except passport and registration service, which structures are often included into &quot;OVD&quot; and sometimes considered one of the important &quot;militsiya&quot; services. Their members have always used different generic names and specific ranks (e.g. &quot;Major of the Internal Service&quot;, rather than &quot;Major of Militsiya&quot;).

==Soviet militsiya (GAI) cars==
The most common types were:

==Post-Soviet Militsiya forces==

===Russia===

The Russian MVD was recreated as the MVD of the Russian SFSR in 1990, following the restoration of the republican Council of Ministers and Supreme Soviet, and remained when Russia gained independence from the Soviet Union. It controlled the Militsiya, the State Road Inspection Service (&quot;GAI&quot;), and the Internal Troops. Since the disbanding of the &quot;Tax Police&quot;, it also investigates economic crimes.

In August 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev introduced new legislation to reform and centralize the funding of the militsiya, as well as to officially change the militsiya&#x27;s name to &quot;Police&quot; (the term which was used in the Russian Empire). The change was performed on March 1, 2011.

===Ukraine===


Militsiya was the national police service of Ukraine from the 1950s until 2015. The militsiya was formed whilst Ukraine was governed by the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, part of the Soviet Union, and continued to serve as a national police service in independent Ukraine until it was replaced by the National Police of Ukraine on 7 November 2015.

===Serbia===
In Serbia the Communal Police force (or Municipal Police) was established in 2009.

In 2016 its name was changed to &quot;Communal Militsya&quot; (Serbian: &quot;Komunalna Milicija&quot; &quot;Комунална Милиција&quot;) under which it continues to operate to the current day.

===Other jurisdictions===

The term &quot;militsiya&quot; remains in use in several parts of the former Soviet Union:

* The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus operates a &quot;militsyya&quot; (), as well as other law-enforcement agencies such as the Presidential Security Service and the State Security Committee (KGB).
* Tajikistan retains the name &quot;militsiya&quot;, sometime translated as &quot;police&quot;.
* The Transdnistrian police force bears the official name &quot;PMR militsiya&quot;.

Cognate terms also came into use in several Soviet bloc countries during the Cold War. Examples included Bulgaria (Peoples&#x27; Militia), Poland (&quot;Milicja Obywatelska&quot;) and other Warsaw Pact nations, as well as the non-aligned SFR Yugoslavia (&quot;Milicija&quot;), which was phased out throughout the 1990s and replaced by &quot;policija&quot; (police) in early 1997. Bulgaria changed the name of its law-enforcement body to &quot;Policija&quot; () in 1991. Romania operated a &quot;Miliția&quot;, but after the communist regime there fell (1989), the &quot;Poliția&quot; replaced it in 1990.

<text>William Jacob Cuppy (August 23, 1884 – September 19, 1949) was an American humorist and literary critic, known for his satirical books about nature and historical figures.

==Early life==
Cuppy was born in Auburn, Indiana. He was named &quot;Will&quot; in memory of an older brother of his father&#x27;s who died of wounds he received as a Union officer at the Civil War Battle of Fort Donelson. Cuppy&#x27;s father, Thomas Jefferson Cuppy (1844–1912), was at different times a grain dealer, a seller of farm implements and a lumber buyer for the Eel River branch of the Wabash Railroad. His mother, Frances Stahl Cuppy (1855–1927), was a seamstress and worked in a small shop located next to the family home in Auburn. Young Cuppy spent summers at a farm belonging to his grandmother, Sarah Collins Cuppy (1813–1900), on the banks of the Eel River near South Whitley, Indiana. He later said that this was where he acquired his early knowledge of the natural world which he satirized in his writings.

Cuppy graduated from Auburn High School in 1902 and went on to the University of Chicago, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1907. As an undergraduate, he belonged to Phi Gamma Delta, acted in amateur theater and worked as campus reporter for several Chicago newspapers, notably the &quot;Record Herald&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;. He lingered at Chicago seven more years as a graduate student in English literature. He did not show much interest in his studies, but in 1910 produced his first book, &quot;Maroon Tales&quot;, a collection of short stories about university life. In 1914 he pulled together a short master&#x27;s thesis, took his degree and left for New York.

==Literary career==

Cuppy supported himself in New York by writing advertising copy while he tried unsuccessfully to write a play. He served briefly stateside in World War I as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Motor Transport Corps. Later he began contributing book reviews to the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, where his college friend Burton Rascoe (1892–1957) was literary editor. According to Rascoe, it was his assistant Isabel Paterson who &quot;coaxed and coddled&quot; Cuppy into writing reviews and making a success of his career as a writer. In 1926, Cuppy began writing a weekly &quot;Light Reading&quot; column, later renamed &quot;Mystery and Adventure&quot;, for the Tribune&#x27;s successor, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. He continued writing the column until his death 23 years later, reviewing a career total of more than 4,000 titles of crime and detective fiction.

Seeking refuge from city noise and hay fever (which he referred to as &quot;rose cold&quot;), Cuppy &quot;hermited&quot; from 1921 to 1929 in a shack on Jones Island, just off Long Island&#x27;s South Shore. The literary result of Cuppy&#x27;s seaside exile was &quot;How to be a Hermit&quot;, a humorous look at home economics that went through six printings in four months when it appeared in 1929. The book&#x27;s subtitle, &quot;A Bachelor Keeps House&quot;, reflects the fact that Cuppy never married. The crew at the nearby Zachs Inlet Coast Guard Station shared their food and recipes with Cuppy and helped him repair his shack.

Encroachment by the new Jones Beach State Park forced Cuppy to abandon full-time residence on the island and return to New York&#x27;s noise and soot. A special dispensation from New York&#x27;s parks czar Robert Moses (1888–1981) let Cuppy keep his shack. He made regular visits to his place at the beach until the end of his life.

From his Greenwich Village apartment, Cuppy continued to turn out magazine articles and books. He always worked from notes jotted on 3x5-inch index cards. Cuppy would amass hundreds of cards even for a short article. His friend and literary executor Fred Feldkamp (1914–1981) reported that Cuppy sometimes read more than 25 thick books on a subject before he wrote a single word about it.

Writing funny but factual magazine articles was Cuppy&#x27;s real talent. He enjoyed a brief success in 1933 with a humorous talk show on NBC radio with actress and gourmet cook Jeanne Owen, but he flopped on the lecture circuit. Basically shy, Cuppy was happiest when he was rummaging through scholarly journals prizing out facts to copy out on his note cards. According to Feldkamp, one of Cuppy&#x27;s favorite places was the Bronx Zoo, &quot;where he felt really relaxed.&quot;

Many of Cuppy&#x27;s articles for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and other magazines were later collected as books: &quot;How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes&quot; (1931); and &quot;How to Become Extinct&quot; (1941). Cuppy also edited three collections of mystery stories: &quot;World&#x27;s Great Mystery Stories&quot; (1943); &quot;World&#x27;s Great Detective Stories&quot; (1943); and &quot;Murder Without Tears&quot; (1946). His last animal book, &quot;How to Attract the Wombat&quot;, appeared two months after his death in 1949.

Cuppy&#x27;s best-known work, a satire on history called &quot;The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody&quot;, was unfinished when he died. Its humor ranges from the remark that, when the Nile floods receded, the land, as far as the eye can see, is &quot;covered by Egyptologists&quot;, to the detailed dissection, quotation, and parody, in the chapter on Alexander the Great, of the picture of Alexander as an idealist for world peace. The book&#x27;s appeal can be gauged by the fact that CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and his colleague Don Hollenbeck took turns reading from it on the air &quot;until the announcer cracked up.&quot;

&quot;The Decline and Fall&quot; was completed and published in 1950 by Fred Feldkamp, who sifted through nearly 15,000 of Cuppy&#x27;s carefully filed note cards to get the book into print within a year of his friend&#x27;s death. Feldkamp also edited a second posthumous volume, a comic almanac titled &quot;How to Get from January to December&quot;, that appeared in 1951.

Cuppy&#x27;s last years were marked by poor physical health and increasing depression. Facing eviction from his apartment, he took an overdose of sleeping pills and died ten days later on September 19, 1949, at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital.

Cuppy&#x27;s cremated remains were returned to his hometown and buried in a grave next to his mother&#x27;s in Evergreen Cemetery. His grave was unmarked until 1985, when local donors purchased a granite headstone with the inscription, &quot;American Humorist&quot;. In 2003, Cuppy received another memorial when a committee of the International Astronomical Union approved the name &quot;15017 Cuppy&quot; for an asteroid. In 2019, the Indiana Historical Bureau approved placing a state historic marker at Cuppy&#x27;s family home in Auburn.

Although Cuppy was reclusive and cultivated the image of a curmudgeon, he had many friends in New York&#x27;s literary circles. One of them was the poet William Rose Benét (1886–1950) who, writing in the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;, penned this remembrance of him:

==Cuppy documents==
Cuppy&#x27;s papers, including thousands of his notecards, are archived at the University of Chicago Library. A number of his letters to his friend and &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; colleague Isabel Paterson are among Paterson&#x27;s papers archived at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum in West Branch, Iowa.
 Two of Cuppy&#x27;s letters to Max Eastman are among Eastman&#x27;s papers at Indiana University&#x27;s Lilly Library. The Frank Sullivan Collection at Cornell University also contains correspondence from Cuppy. The papers of John Towner Frederick at the University of Iowa include letters written by Cuppy in the 1940s relating to Frederick&#x27;s &quot;Of Men and Books&quot; series for CBS Radio. Four letters from Cuppy to children&#x27;s author Anne Carroll Moore are among her papers at the New York Public Library

==Iranian controversy==
A Persian translation by Najaf Daryabandari of Cuppy&#x27;s &quot;The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody&quot; was published in 1972 under the title of &quot;Čenin konand bozorgān&quot; (چنین کنند بزرگان, &quot;Thus Act the Great&quot;). The good quality of the Persian prose and the fact of Cuppy&#x27;s being unknown in Iran led to speculation that the book was not a translation, but an original book by Daryabandari and possibly a collaborator, who was speculated to be Ahmad Shamlou. It was guessed that this had been done in order to bypass the Pahlavi era censor. Daryabandari denied it several times, even after the Iranian Revolution. The issue was not publicly settled until the satire magazine &quot;Golagha&quot; ran an article about their &quot;discovery&quot; of Cuppy, which proved Daryabandari right.

<doc id="854732" wikidata="Q1246469" url="?curid=854732" title="Hawaii Aloha">
<text>&quot;Hawaii Aloha,&quot; also called &quot;Kuu One Hanau,&quot; is a revered anthem of the native Hawaiian people and Hawaii residents alike. Written by the Reverend Lorenzo Lyons, (1807-1886), also known as Makua Laiana, a Christian minister who died in 1886, to an old hymn, &quot;I Left It All With Jesus,&quot; composed by James McGranahan (1840-1907), &quot;Hawai‘i Aloha&quot; was considered by the Hawaii State Legislature in 1967 and by the Hawaii State Constitutional Convention in 1978 to become the official state song, but &quot;Hawaii Pono‘ī,&quot; written by King David Kalākaua and composed by Royal Hawaiian Band Master Henri Berger, was chosen instead.

&quot;Hawaii Aloha&quot; is typically sung in both small and large, formal and informal gatherings, both in Hawaii and abroad, while participants stand in a circle with joined hands. It is a feature of the inauguration of the Governor of Hawaii (called Ke Kiaaina), and the opening sessions of the Hawai‘i State House of Representatives and Hawaii State Senate. Traditionally, the last chorus is sung with hands raised above heads; the act of raising hands is especially important to advocates of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.

<doc id="854733" wikidata="Q7358123" url="?curid=854733" title="Roger Dudley">
<text>Roger Dudley (born between 1535 and 1545 – 1586?/1588?) was an English soldier.

Dudley was born in London, England, and may have been baptised in Yardley Hastings, Northamptonshire. Dudley&#x27;s parentage has never been satisfactorily established. Genealogist and researcher Marshall Kirk in 1993 published the results of his exhaustive survey of the Sutton Dudley families, and came to the conclusion that Roger was the son of Henry Sutton Dudley .

Roger may also be the Roger Dudley who was matriculated as pensioner at Christ Church College, Cambridge, in 1566, but left without a degree.

It is believed that Roger married, on 8 June 1575, at Lidlington, Bedfordshire, Susannah (née Thorne), herself recorded as having been born on 5 March 1559/60 in Northamptonshire, and baptised at Yardley Hastings, the daughter of Thomas Thorne and Mary Purefoy, (the Purefoys being of noble descent).

He is reported to have been a Captain in the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s militia, fighting with a commission from Elizabeth I, and under the banner of Henry of Navarre. He was thought to have died at the Battle of Ivry, France in 1590. However, the Reverend Cotton Mather of Boston wrote: &quot;Thomas Dudley&#x27;s father was Captain Roger Dudley, -- slain in the wars, when -- his son, and one only daughter were very young&quot;. The will of Thomas Dorne (Thorne) of Yardley Hastings, Gent., dated 29 Oct 1588, bequeathed &quot;to the children of Susan Dudley, my Daughter, widow, £10 to be equally divided&quot;. (S1, S11). Therefore, Roger was dead at the time of the will of his father-in-law, which, written in 1588, eliminates the Battle of Ivry as a possible date for his death. It is most probable that he died at the Siege of Zutphen in 1586, having followed his kinsman, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who was a principal figure in that battle, which also claimed the life of Leicester&#x27;s nephew Sir Philip Sidney.

Marshall K. Kirk suggests that Roger made his home after his father&#x27;s death with Peter Grey, a &quot;Queen&#x27;s servant&quot;, whose manor of Segenhoe was two miles from Lidlington, (Bedfordshire), &quot;where Roger was later married&quot;.

Roger and Susannah Dudley left either five or two (Thomas and a sister orphaned children.:

*Thomas Dudley (second governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony)
*Mary Dudley
*Richard Dudley (b. 1583 – d. 20 Aug 1603)
*Dorothy Dudley
*David Dudley

Susannah is recorded as having died in 1585 during childbirth, at St. Dunstan&#x27;s, London and her name appears again three years later in a will, dated 29 October 1588, (Probate 9 May 1589), in which Thomas Thorne bequeaths... &quot;to the Children of Susan Dudley, my Daughter...&quot; (etc.)

Roger and Susannah Thorne Dudley&#x27;s children sired a vast progeny in America . Among many others who founded or were pillars of early New England communities, William Dudley, a son of David, was the first of this line in the family of the lords of Dudley to move to Connecticut, where he founded the settlement of Guilford on the shores of Long Island Sound. He emigrated to New England sometime between 1636 and 1643, a period corresponding to his uncle Thomas&#x27;s political ascendancy in Massachusetts.

Three of William Dudley&#x27;s great grandsons were to give their family name to their new home in the Cornwall hills, when they moved to Owlsbury from Guilford in the mid 17th century. Owlsbury was renamed Dudleytown, and thereafter the persistent legend of America&#x27;s most haunted town was born.

<text>The Royal Television Society (RTS) is a British-based educational charity for the discussion, and analysis of television in all its forms, past, present, and future. It is the oldest television society in the world. It currently has fourteen regional and national centres in the UK, as well as a branch in the Republic of Ireland.

==History==
The group was formed as the Television Society on 7 September 1927, a time when television was still in its experimental stage. Regular high-definition (then defined as at least 200 lines) broadcasts did not even begin for another nine years until the BBC began its transmissions from Alexandra Palace in 1936.

In addition to serving as a forum for scientists and engineers, the society published regular newsletters charting the development of the new medium. These documents now form important historical records of the early history of television broadcasting.

The society was granted its Royal title in 1966. The Prince of Wales became patron of the Society in November 1997.

==Activities==
The society regularly holds meetings and seminars, attended by members of the public and professionals from various areas of the television industry, and it also publishes the monthly magazine &quot;Television&quot;, covering a broad range of television topics.

Major events held by the RTS include the biennial RTS Cambridge Convention, a three-day event held at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. The convention, chaired by one of the UK&#x27;s major broadcasters, brings together influential figures from the television industry for a series of stimulating talks.

The RTS also hosts &quot;Anatomy of a Hit&quot; events, which gather together the writers, cast and commissioner of some of Britain&#x27;s most successful TV shows to discuss their qualities. Recent programmes discussed have included &quot;Sherlock&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and &quot;Humans&quot;.

The society also holds a substantial archive of printed, photographic, and audio-visual material of value to television historians and scholars.

==Awards==
The Royal Television Society hosts six national award ceremonies annually:

National Awards

*RTS Programme Awards
*RTS Craft &amp; Design Awards
*RTS Television Journalism Awards
*RTS Student Television Awards
*RTS Young Technologist Awards is given to this seen as potential future leaders in broadcasting technology.

The Royal Television Society hosts fifteen regional award ceremonies annually:

*RTS Cymru/Wales Awards
*RTS Devon and Cornwall Awards
*RTS East Awards
*RTS Isle of Man Awards
*RTS London Awards
*RTS Midlands Awards
*RTS North East and Border Awards
*RTS North West Awards
*RTS Northern Ireland Awards 
*RTS Republic of Ireland Awards 
*RTS Scotland Awards
*RTS Southern Awards
*RTS Thames Valley Awards

==RTS Futures==
RTS Futures was launched in 2007 to help people in the early stages of their television careers. RTS Futures offers the opportunity to meet with senior industry professionals, such as series producers and commissioners, as well as their peers in the television industry.
RTS Futures hosts a wide range of talks and training sessions aimed at helping young people progress in the business. Recent events have included How to be the Best Researcher and the RTS Futures Entry Level Training Fair.

<text>The Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences was a standing committee of the United States Senate from 1958 until 1977, when it was folded into the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. It was preceded by the Special Committee on Space and Astronautics, which operated from February 6, 1958, to March 11, 1959.

==History==
The Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences was established July 24, 1958, when the Senate adopted S. Res. 327, introduced by Senator Lyndon Johnson. The resolution also extended the term of the Special Committee on Space and Astronautics until March 11, 1959, so it could complete its final report. Many of the members of the special committee joined the new standing committee.

==Jurisdiction==
The standing committee was given jurisdiction over the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and all aeronautical and space sciences generally. However, matters concerning the development of weapons systems or military operations were reserved for the Senate Armed Services Committee. However, the Space Committee was permitted to survey, review, and report on both military and civilian space activities of the United States. According to Senate Rule 25, as amended at the time, the committee was to consist of 16 Senators.

<text>BitPass was an American company from 2002-2007 that developed an online payment system for digital content and services including micropayments. One of its best-known projects was the Mperia online music store catering to unsigned artists.

==Background==

Kurt Huang and Gyuchang Jun founded BitPass. Michael O&#x27;Donnell was brought on as CEO in 2004, but left by April 2005, and was eventually replaced by Doug Knopper in November 2005.

Although the origins of the idea for the company dated back to 1999, the company incorporated and got off the ground with $1.5 million in joint venture funding led by Garage Technology Ventures in late 2002. The first test version of the product was launched in June 2003. In late 2004, a second funding round of $11.75 million was announced.

For the content buyer, Bitpass worked like a pre-paid telephone card: the buyer signed up for the service and put money into an account using a credit card or PayPal. This stored-value amount could be used to purchase digital content or services. Transaction fees were paid by the content provider. For payments under $5, the charge was 15% of the price paid by the buyer (Bitpass Professional merchant account fee). BitPass also partnered with major technology and financial services companies such as Microsoft, PayPal, the Royal Bank of Scotland and First Data.

On January 19, 2007 Bitpass announced that they were shutting down, and operations officially closed on January 26, 2007.

==Mperia==

Mperia was an online music store founded in 2003 by BitPass to use the BitPass payment system. Launched by Huang and Joshua Ellis, it was aimed toward allowing independent musicians to sell their music online. Artists could upload their own music directly, and could price their own music, with tracking costing between US$0.25 and US$1.50. No digital rights management features were permitted. Artists kept 70% of each track&#x27;s revenue.

In 2004, Mperia partnered with CD Baby to sell tracks from CDBaby&#x27;s catalog.

With the shutdown of BitPass, Mperia also shut down in early 2007.

<doc id="854762" wikidata="Q1535858" url="?curid=854762" title="The Hoover Company">
<text>The Hoover Company is a home appliance company founded in Ohio, United States, in 1908. It also established a major base in the United Kingdom, where it dominated the electric vacuum cleaner industry during most of the 20th century, to the point where the Hoover brand name became synonymous with vacuum cleaners and vacuuming in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Hoover North America was once part of Maytag, but was sold by Maytag&#x27;s new owners Whirlpool Corporation in 2007 to Hong Kong multinational manufacturing company Techtronic Industries for $107 million. Hoover International had already split from Hoover North America in 1993, and was acquired by Candy in 1995, which was acquired by Haier in 2019. 

In addition to producing floorcare products, Hoover was also an iconic domestic appliance brand in Europe, particularly well known for its washing machines and tumble dryers in the UK and Ireland, and also had significant sales in many parts of Europe. Today, the Hoover Europe brand, as part of the portfolio of brands owned by Chinese multinational home appliances company Haier remains a major player in the European white goods and floor care sectors in a number of countries.

==History==
The first upright vacuum cleaner was invented in June 1908 in North Canton, Ohio, by department store janitor and occasional inventor James Murray Spangler. Spangler was an asthmatic, and suspecting the carpet sweeper he was using at work was the cause of his ailment, he created a basic suction-sweeper by mounting an electric fan motor on a carpet sweeper and then adding a soap box and a broom handle. After refining the design and obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper he set about producing it himself, assisted by his son, who helped him assemble the machines, and his daughter, who assembled the dust bags. Production was slow, completing just two to three machines a week.

Spangler soon gave one of his Electric Suction Sweepers to his cousin Susan Troxel Hoover, who used it at home. Impressed with the machine, she told her husband and son about it. William Henry &quot;Boss&quot; Hoover and son Herbert William Hoover Sr. were leather goods manufacturers in North Canton, Ohio, which at the time was called New Berlin. Hoover bought the patent from Spangler later that same year, founding the Electric Suction Sweeper Company for an initial capital investment of $36,000 ($ today), retaining Spangler as production supervisor with pay based on royalties in the new business. Spangler continued to contribute to the company, patenting numerous further Suction Sweeper designs until his death in 1915, when the company name was changed to the Hoover Suction Sweeper Company, with Spangler&#x27;s family continuing to receive royalties from his original patent until 1925.

==Henry Dreyfuss and Hoover==
In the early 1930s, the company retained the services of Henry Dreyfuss, an up-and-coming industrial designer, to give the Hoover lineup a much needed update. Before Dreyfuss&#x27;s involvement with the company, the majority of the machines manufactured consisted of a black motor and an aluminum base; this was the norm for more than twenty years. When Hoover introduced the &#x27;Hedlite&#x27; in 1932, it was rather awkward and unattractive. 

Dreyfuss made the machine more aesthetically pleasing and echoed the trends of streamlined design. In 1935, he was commissioned to completely redesign the Hoover cleaner. In 1936, for a fee of 25,000 USD, Dreyfuss sold Hoover the design which would become the Model 150 cleaner. For the first time since the introduction of the Hoover vacuum cleaner, the mechanical workings were completely concealed from sight by a Bakelite cover. This cover was a tear-drop styled shell, which seamlessly incorporated the headlight. Also, he totally revamped the base of the machine. Since the release of this design, all Hoover cleaners consisted of a fluid base and a hood to cover the electric motor. These designs suggested efficiency, cleanliness, and speed. His final design for the Hoover Company was the 1957 Convertible.

== Development ==
Faced with a total lack of interest by the public in his expensive and unfamiliar new gadget, Hoover placed an ad in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; offering customers ten days&#x27; free use of his vacuum cleaner to anyone who requested it. Using a network of local retailers to facilitate the offer, Hoover thus developed a national network of retailers for the vacuums. By the end of 1908, the company had sold 372 Model 0s. By 1912, sales had been made to Norway, France, Russia, Belgium, Holland and Scotland.

In 1919, Gerald Page-Wood – an art director of Erwin, Wasey &amp; Company, Hoover&#x27;s advertising agency – came up with a succinct slogan which summed up the Hoover&#x27;s cleaning action: &#x27;It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans&#x27;. At this time, it referred to the action of the revolving brushes, which vibrated the carpet and helped loosen the trodden-in grit. This offered an advantage over competitors&#x27; machines, which used suction alone to remove dirt, and therefore were not as efficient as the Hoover. Seven years later, the famous slogan would adapt to even more significance.

Hoover&#x27;s business began to flourish, and, a year after Hoover acquired the patent from Spangler, he established a research and development department for his new business. By 1926, Hoover had developed the &#x27;beater bar&#x27; - a metal bar attached to the rotating brush roll, situated in the floor nozzle cavity of the upright vacuum cleaner. Introduced on Models 543 and 700, the beater bars alternated with the sweeping brushes to vibrate the carpet while sucking. It provided a more distinct &#x27;tap&#x27; than the bristle tufts used on the former machines, and led to a 101% increase in efficiency. This cleaning action was marketed by Hoover as &quot;Positive Agitation&quot;. &#x27;It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans&#x27; rang more true now than ever.
In 1929, Hoover introduced the Model 200 Duster. This would be their first attempt at a cylinder cleaner. It used a Model 575 motor with a modified suction impeller, which was mounted on a unique aluminum body with runners, allowing the cleaner to be pulled behind the user. The Duster was produced for only three months and roughly 9,000 were made.

Herbert W. Hoover, Sr. took over as president of the company in 1922 and as chairman of the board of the Hoover Company in 1932. 1930 saw the introduction of the world&#x27;s first handheld vacuum cleaner, the Hoover Dustette. The good design and exceptional durability of these machines mean many are still in service today, some at over 80 years old.
In 1932, Hoover introduced a new optional headlamp called the Hoover Hedlite on Models 425, 750 and 900. By March 1932, it had become standard equipment on Models 750 and 900, and a $5 extra-cost option on Model 425. The Hoover Hedlite illuminated the floor ahead of the cleaner, useful for dimly-lit rooms and corridors, and under furniture. Several new slogans mentioned the light, including &#x27;It shows you the dirt you never knew you had!&#x27;, and &#x27;It lights where it&#x27;s going...it&#x27;s clean where it&#x27;s gone!&#x27;.

In 1936, Hoover introduced the top-of-the-line Model 150. It had a time to empty bag indicator; automatic height adjustment; a magnesium body, which made it weigh less than previous models; instant tool conversion; and a two-speed motor. One of the first Dreyfuss designs for Hoover, it was the symbol of the machine age; the beautiful Bakelite hood hid the entire motor from view and there were no protruding knobs or gadgets. It was the first Hoover cleaner that was not of the traditional &quot;coffee can&quot; style, which Hoover had been using since its earliest years. The cleaner sold from 1936 to 1939 and was priced at $80 ($ today). Two other lower-priced Hoovers sold along with the 150: the Model 25 (1937–38), which was the middle-of-the-line cleaner priced at $65 ($ today), and the Model 300 (1935–38), which became the bottom-of-the-line cleaner and sold at $49.75 ($). Due to the backdrop of the Great Depression, Hoover produced only 166,000 150s in its three-year production run.

From 1941 to 1945, Hoover ceased all vacuum cleaner production and converted the North Canton, Ohio factory to support the war effort. When World War II ended in 1945, Hoover started producing cleaners again and unveiled the Model 27 for post-war America to enjoy.

In 1950, Hoover introduced the Veriflex, which was the first rubberized suction hose in the industry. Other cleaners at the time were using cloth-braided hoses, which would deteriorate and lose suction over time. In 1954, Herbert W. Hoover Jr. took over the presidency of the company from his father. A nephew of the founder, H. Earl Hoover, also served as chairman and honorary director.

The sombre and restrained colors of the previous decades gave way to bright, striking modern color-schemes, starting with the Hoover Model 29 in 1950, which was red instead of the regular black and brown colors of the past. This was part of their policy of the continual development and modernization of their output.

In 1957, Hoover introduced the Convertible Model 65 (the De Luxe 652 in the UK). It was the last machine designed by Henry Dreyfuss, the industrial designer who had worked with the company since the early 1930s. This cleaner introduced what Hoover called &#x27;Automatic Shift&#x27;, a system whereby the tool converter plugged into the rear of the cleaner. This was not a new idea: instant tool conversion had been introduced in 1936 with the Model 150 Cleaning Ensemble. However, new to Model 65, and slightly later in Britain on the 652A, was the introduction of a switch which automatically shifted the motor to a higher speed as the converter was inserted. The Convertible, or the Senior, in Britain, remains Hoover&#x27;s worldwide bestselling cleaner. Although the domestic line was finally discontinued in 1993, a version called the Guardsman is still available in the commercial sector.

1963 saw the introduction of the Dial-A-Matic in the US – sold in Australia as the Dynamatic, and in Britain as the Convertible. This was the first-ever clean-air upright cleaner. The clean-air principle is similar to the flow of air through a cylinder/canister cleaner. Rather than the dirt passing directly through the suction fan and being blown into the bag, it passes through the bag first, leaving only clean air to pass through the fan. This principle was soon adopted by many manufacturers and continues to be used today. Also, the machine was constructed out of hard plastic. Hoover produced this cleaner from 1963 until the late 1970s in America.

In the summer of 1969, Hoover further refined the Dial-A-Matic&#x27;s design when they launched the &#x27;Powerdrive&#x27; self-propulsion system on the Hoover model 1170. This idea took much of the effort out of pushing the cleaner, because, by using a system of gears, wheels, and belts, the cleaner used its own power to drive itself forward and backwards, the speed and direction being controlled entirely by the user though the &#x27;Triple-Action&#x27; handgrip. The powerdrive feature on the model 1170 was so efficient, the user could push the bulky machine forward with one finger, and the feature could also be disengaged with a button on the handgrip so the machine could travel easily from room to room with the motor turned off, the machine was very difficult to push when the motor was turned off and the powerdrive was still activated. This was also the first vacuum cleaner available commercially that used the self-propulsion system. This extra technology made the Dial-A-Matic even heavier than the original and more expensive, at around $150 ($ today). The &#x27;Powerdrive&#x27; system was carried over into the Concept range in 1978. The powerdrive system was later renamed &quot;Self Propelled&quot;. Hoover continued to use this feature on many products of the 1980s and 1990s. It is still being used today by Hoover and numerous other companies.

In 1986, the Hoover family sold the company to the Chicago Pacific Corporation, which was created using the remnants of the bankrupt Rock Island Railroad. It was acquired by Maytag Corporation in 1989.

On Friday, 6 March 2009, Hoover confirmed that it would discontinue production of washing machines and other laundry products at its Merthyr Tydfil factory, Mid Glamorgan from Saturday, 14 March 2009; giving the reason, the company stated that it could no longer manufacture competitively priced laundry products at the plant.

Hoover had initially announced its closure intentions on Tuesday, 18 November 2008, beginning a period of staff consultation. The company was established in the town just over sixty years prior, its factory at Pentrebach, Merthyr Tydfil, opening on 12 October 1948.

Though 337 jobs were lost because of this decision, Hoover UK anticipated retaining its headquarters, logistics, storage and after sales service functions at the site, with some 113 workers retained. In 2019, Hoover opened a new head office in Warrington, Cheshire. It retained a distribution centre at Pentrebach. Hoover are the current shirt sponsor for Rugby League club Warrington Wolves.

=== Popular Hoover machines ===

;The Junior: Introduced by Hoover Limited (UK) in the 1930s, the Hoover Junior is a smaller upright type vacuum for apartments or small houses which was easy to carry around. The Junior was very popular in the UK; Hoover sold millions of them, and it became the biggest selling vacuum there. Various models were produced, with the final machine being manufactured in 1987. Hoover Limited made Juniors for export to the US from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. The exported Juniors were converted to American electrical standards by The Hoover Company in North Canton, Ohio. Finding a Hoover Junior in the USA is quite rare. The Junior was never referred to as such in the USA; it was tagged in official Hoover literature as the Lightweight Upright.
;The Dirtsearcher: Introduced again by Hoover Limited (UK) in 1969, was a development of the Junior with a Model 638 style headlamp fitted in place of the tool adapter cover at the front. This model the 1354 went on to be the most successful UK Hoover manufactured model selling in both European and Commonwealth markets, however it was never sold in the US, although there were 110 V versions of the UK-market Juniors sold in Canada (such as the 1354A). They were sold alongside the Junior and Senior/Ranger models becoming the now rare models U1016 and U1040.
;The Portable: The Hoover Portable was launched by Hoover in 1963. It is a &quot;Suitcase&quot; type canister that did not have wheels; it would tugged around with by the user. When finished, the hose, attachments, and power cord would be stored inside the machine. In 1969, Hoover added wheels to the Portable. The Portable was manufactured until 1978. Also, it used the same motor as the Hoover Dial-A-Matic, the first clean-air upright.
;The Constellation: In 1954, Hoover introduced the Model 82 Constellation. It was a radically new design in cylinder and tank cleaners. Designed by Henry Dreyfuss, it represented America&#x27;s obsession with the space race. Its spherical shape resembled the planet Saturn and impersonated developing space technology. Its most memorable attribute was the ability to &quot;walk on air&quot;, which eliminated the need for casters, wheels or runners. The cleaner was made mobile by directing its exhaust air down toward the floor, which caused the cleaner to rise enough from the floor to hover and float behind the user (starting with the Model 84). This was an engineering marvel in and of itself. The Constellation cleaner remained extremely popular in its close to 25-year run, with minor design modifications. The machine was discontinued in the mid-1970s with the introduction of the Hoover Celebrity; however, the Constellation was still produced in the UK well into the 1980s. The machine was so fondly remembered that it was reintroduced and sold from 2006 to 2009.
;Model 28: Introduced in 1946, Hoover produced over two million of this model for post-war America. It sold from 1946 to 1950.
;Model 63: In 1953, Hoover debuted the &#x27;deluxe&#x27; Model 63 for $116.95 ($ today). It was the first Hoover to utilize a full wrap around bumper and a completely disposable dust bag. The cleaner was styled in two-tone baby blue (base) and navy blue (everything except the base). It was an extremely popular model and sold over four million units. The machine was produced from 1953 to 1956. It was sold, in smaller numbers, in the UK, as the model 638. Again, this machine was designed by Henry Dreyfuss.
;Hoovermatic: A long-running line of top-loading twin-tub washing machines which ran from 1948 until 1993, sold mainly in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Hoovermatics were also sold in North America under the &quot;Washdog&quot; name. The machines used a unique washing action which made use of an impeller (known as a &quot;Pulsator&quot;), situated on the side of the wash tub, which revolved at high speed to create a moving current of water in the wash tub that dragged the laundry through the water.
;The Convertible: 1957 ushered in the &quot;long, low and rarin&#x27; to go&quot; Convertible. The name derives from the cleaner&#x27;s ability to &#x27;automatically shift&#x27; into a higher speed upon insertion of the tool converter for more powerful above the floor cleaning. Beginning with the Model 65, it soon became one of the most popular and well known cleaners in American history. The Convertible line was in production from 1957 to the early 1990s, and is still sold in variations in the commercial sector. The &quot;Convertible&quot; was also widely sold in the UK under the name &quot;Senior&quot;: the Senior Cleaners were viewed to be the model for larger homes, and although it never outsold the Junior in Britain, it was still a massively popular cleaner.

===Current products===
The products sold under the Hoover brand vary increasingly from one market to the next. For example, in the United States, the Hoover brand is used exclusively to sell floorcare products produced by TTI. Meanwhile, in the UK and most of Europe, Hoover branding appears on Candy Group products including white goods such as washing machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators, as well as floorcare products. Current details of the product range available to consumers can be found by visiting the Hoover website for the market of interest.

== The word &quot;hoover&quot; ==
In the UK and Ireland the word &quot;hoover&quot; has long been colloquially synonymous with &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot; and the verb &quot;to vacuum&quot; (e.g. &quot;you were hoovering the carpet&quot;), since the Hoover Company&#x27;s dominance there during the early 20th century. Despite Hoover no longer being the top seller of vacuum cleaners in the UK, the term &quot;hoover&quot; has remained as a genericized trademark.

== The Hoover Historical Center ==

In 1978, the Hoover Company opened a museum in the old Hoover home in North Canton, Ohio on the campus of Walsh University. It is called The Hoover Historical Center, and is dedicated to the history of the Hoover company in Canton. The museum exhibits include a number of non-Hoover hand-operated vacuum cleaners from before the company started, and displays of Hoover products throughout the company&#x27;s history. Also on display are some of the munitions the company produced during World War II to help the war effort, and Hoover family personal items.

==Ownership transitions==

The company became publicly traded in the 1940s. Stock in Hoover was first sold on August 6, 1943, allowing the company to expand. In 1985, Hoover was purchased by the Chicago Pacific Corporation, and in 1989, Chicago Pacific was purchased by Maytag.

In 1993, the Hoover Trading Company and Hoover UK merged to become the Hoover European Appliances Group. In 1995, Candy Group acquired the Hoover European Appliances Group in its entirety with the exclusive rights on the brand for the whole of Europe (including all territories of the former-Soviet Union), North Africa and selected countries in the Middle East.

In 2004, Maytag announced that it would consolidate its corporate office and back-office operations in Newton, Iowa, and close almost all of Hoover&#x27;s overlapping functions. This effectively meant that most white-collar jobs at Hoover&#x27;s North Canton location would be eliminated. The company had previously closed another manufacturing facility in Jackson Township, Stark County, Ohio, and the facility was sold to a church. Like many manufacturing companies in the United States, Hoover is experiencing pressures as consumers demand lower-priced goods. Hoover has operations in Mexico, where operating costs are lower than in the United States.

After Maytag was acquired by Whirlpool in 2006, that firm reached an agreement to sell Hoover to Hong Kong–based firm Techtronic Industries. TTI announced its intention to close the original plant in North Canton in September 2007.

==Hoover in Australia==
Since 1954, the Hoover factory at Meadowbank had manufactured washing machines and other products. A subsidiary of the US company, Hoover Australia merged with Chicago Pacific in 1985 and Maytag in 1989. Hoover Australia had its own administration, sales and marketing, large maintenance and engineering departments, a service division, and a much larger production workforce. At that time, in the early 1990s, Hoover was making healthy profits, as a result of investment in new technology and machinery through the late 1980s, a big drive towards quality improvement, and a very flexible workforce.

In 1994, Hoover Australia was to be listed as a public company with a six-monthly operating profit of $8,850,000. That sparked a fight between Email Limited and Southcorp, two of Australia&#x27;s largest white goods manufacturers for a commercial sale. Both companies were eager to strengthen their market share and further monopolize the whitegoods industry. In December 1994, Southcorp announced that it had bought Hoover Australia. In March 1996, Southcorp began a big rationalization, sacking workers at the Hoover factory involved in maintenance, stores, administration and supervision. Also in the year up to March 1996, there had been a large increase in Southcorp&#x27;s share price.

In April, 1999, Southcorp Appliances, including Hoover, Dishlex and Chef, was sold, meaning that Email had obtained a conservative 60 percent share of the Australian whitegoods market.

After the Southcorp takeover, a culture of fear was introduced, based on a concerted campaign to strip all the indirect labor from the workforce, and a myth that the factory was inefficient and unproductive. Every month it was reported the factory was losing $1 million or more. Morale at the factory went into a downward spiral. That was followed by decisions to stop production of barrel and upright vacuum cleaners, followed by front-loading washing machines. They were replaced with imported products. Plastic molding production was contracted out. The factory was being stripped of production, volume and jobs. A cost reduction campaign followed with good-quality components being replaced by inferior cheap components, and there was a complete breakdown of any real preventive maintenance program, which resulted in a large number of machine and equipment breakdowns. The reality, rather than the myth, was the Hoover Meadowbank site was being run into the ground by corporate decisions.

In the late 1990s, Email closed the Meadowbank factory and integrated its whitegoods manufacturing into the Simpson plant in South Australia. The vacuum cleaner side of the business was sold to Godfreys. Several years later, Email itself was sold and broken up, and the whitegoods division of Email was sold to Electrolux in February 2001. Shortly after taking ownership, Electrolux ceased leasing the Hoover brand name, and the manufacturing and supply of Hoover white goods ceased in Australia.. 

As of 2019, Hoover whitegoods are now being sold throughout Australia through several retailers.

==Free flights promotion==

In 1992, the British division of Hoover announced the Hoover free flights promotion, the demand for which rose far beyond the company&#x27;s expectations, resulting in major costs and public relations problems for the British division and Maytag, which eventually led to its sale to the Italian manufacturer Candy. In 1993, legal action was started in the United Kingdom to take Hoover to court over the promotion, and was successful in &quot;Hoover v. Sandy Jack&quot; at the sheriff court in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Hoover Holiday Pressure Group furthered court action against Hoover at St Helens in Merseyside.

==Competition==
In 2000, US company Hoover was found guilty of patent infringement, as they used Dyson&#x27;s Dual Cyclone in their Vortex vacuum—except they added one more Cyclone, calling it a Triple Vortex Cyclone As a result, Hoover lost its dominant position in the UK and in the United States, and now faces strong competition from numerous brands.

In the United States, Hoover&#x27;s competition includes: Royal, Dirt Devil, Oreck, and Vax (all of which are owned by Hoover&#x27;s Hong Kong owner Techtronic Industries); Kirby; Rexair; Eureka; Dyson; Electrolux; Panasonic; Bissell; and Kenmore (the house brand of American store chain Sears, which is manufactured predominantly by Panasonic and Sanyo).

Dyson and Electrolux lead the list of UK competitors, followed by Bosch, Dirt Devil, SEBO, Vax, Morphy Richards, Miele, Bissell, Numatic (maker of the famous &quot;Henry&quot; cylinder cleaner), Zanussi, Russell Hobbs, LG, and others.

<text>A tenement is a type of building shared by multiple dwellings, typically with flats or apartments on each floor and with shared entrance stairway access. They are common on the British Isles, particularly in Scotland. In the medieval Old Town, in Edinburgh, tenements were developed with each apartment treated as a separate house, built on top of each other (such as Gladstone&#x27;s Land). Over hundreds of years, custom grew to become law concerning maintenance and repairs, as first formally discussed in Stair&#x27;s 1681 writings on Scots property law. In Scotland, these are now governed by the Tenements Act, which replaced the old Law of the Tenement and created a new system of common ownership and procedures concerning repairs and maintenance of tenements. Tenements with one- or two-room flats provided popular rented accommodation for workers, but in some inner-city areas, overcrowding and maintenance problems led to shanty towns, which have been cleared and redeveloped. In more affluent areas, tenement flats form spacious privately owned houses, some with up to six bedrooms, which continue to be desirable properties.
In the United States, the term &quot;tenement&quot; initially meant a large building with multiple small spaces to rent. As cities grew in the nineteenth century, there was increasing separation between rich and poor. With rapid urban growth and immigration, overcrowded houses with poor sanitation gave tenements a reputation as shanty towns. 
The expression &quot;tenement house&quot; was used to designate a building subdivided to provide cheap rental accommodation, which was initially a subdivision of a large house. Beginning in the 1850s, purpose-built tenements of up to six stories held several households on each floor. Various names were introduced for better dwellings, and eventually modern apartments predominated in American urban living.

In parts of England, especially Devon and Cornwall, the word refers to an outshot, or additional projecting part at the back of a terraced house, normally with its roof.

==History==
One of the earliest examples of a tenement is Morris Castle in Swansea, Wales. The castle was built sometime before 1775 by Sir John Morris to house workers in the rapidly industrializing area. The castle&#x27;s location was hazardous and impractical and many workers preferred to live in individual cottages. As such, the tenement was abandoned in the 1850s.

The term &quot;tenement&quot; originally referred to tenancy and therefore to any rented accommodation. The New York State legislature defined it in the Tenement House Act of 1867 in terms of rental occupancy by multiple households, as

In Scotland, it continues to be the most common word for a multiple-occupancy building, but elsewhere it is used as a pejorative in contrast to &quot;apartment building&quot; or &quot;block of flats&quot;. Tenement houses were either adapted or built for the working class as cities industrialized, and came to be contrasted with middle-class apartment houses, which started to become fashionable later in the 19th century. Late-19th-century social reformers in the United States were hostile to both tenements (for fostering disease, and immorality in the young) and apartment houses (for fostering &quot;sexual immorality, sloth, and divorce&quot;).

==Specific places==

===New York===

As the United States industrialized during the 19th century, immigrants and workers from the countryside were housed in former middle-class houses and other buildings, such as warehouses, which were bought up and divided into small dwellings. Beginning as early as the 1830s in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side or possibly the 1820s on Mott Street, three- and four-story buildings were converted into &quot;railroad flats,&quot; so called because the rooms were linked together like the cars of a train, with windowless internal rooms. The adapted buildings were also known as &quot;rookeries,&quot; and these were a particular concern, as they were prone to collapse and fire. Mulberry Bend and Five Points were the sites of notorious rookeries that the city worked for decades to clear. In both rookeries and purpose-built tenements, communal water taps and water closets (either privies or &quot;school sinks,&quot; which opened into a vault that often became clogged) were squeezed into the small open spaces between buildings. In parts of the Lower East Side, buildings were older and had courtyards, generally occupied by machine shops, stables, and other businesses.

Such tenements were particularly prevalent in New York, where in 1865 a report stated that 500,000 people lived in unhealthy tenements, whereas in Boston in 1845, less than a quarter of workers were housed in tenements. One reason New York had so many tenements was the large number of immigrants; another was that the grid plan on which streets were laid out, and the economic practice of building on individual lots, combined to produce high land coverage. Prior to 1867, tenements often covered more than 90 percent of the lot, were five or six stories high, and had 18 rooms per floor, of which only two received direct sunlight. Yards were a few feet wide and often filled with privies. Interior rooms were unventilated.

Early in the 19th century, many of the poor were housed in cellars, which became even less sanitary after the Croton Aqueduct brought running water to wealthier New Yorkers: the reduction in well use caused the water table to rise, and the cellar dwellings flooded. Early housing reformers urged the construction of tenements to replace cellars, and beginning in 1859 the number of people living in cellars began to decline.


The Tenement House Act of 1866, the state legislature&#x27;s first comprehensive legislation on housing conditions, prohibited cellar apartments unless the ceiling was above street level; required one water closet per 20 residents and the provision of fire escapes; and paid some attention to space between buildings. This was amended by the Tenement House Act of 1879, known as the Old Law, which required lot coverage of no more than 65 percent. As of 1869, New York State law defined a &quot;tenement house&quot; as &quot;any house or building, or portion thereof, which is rented, leased let or hired out, to be occupied, or is occupied as the home or residence of three families or more living independently of each other, and doing their cooking upon the premises, or by more than two families upon any floor, so living and cooking, but having a right in the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets or privies, or some of them.&quot; L 1867, ch 908. The New York City Board of Health was empowered to enforce these regulations, but it declined to do so. As a compromise, the &quot;Old Law tenement&quot; became the standard: this had a &quot;dumbbell&quot; shape, with air and light shafts on either side in the center (usually fitted to the shafts in the adjacent buildings), and it typically covered 80 percent of the lot. James E. Ware is credited with the design; he had won a contest the previous year held by &quot;Plumber and Sanitary Engineer&quot; Magazine to find the most practical improved tenement design, in which profitability was the most important factor to the jury.

Public concern about New York tenements was stirred by publication in 1890 of Jacob Riis&#x27;s &quot;How the Other Half Lives &quot;, and in 1892 by Riis&#x27;s &quot;The Children of the Poor.&quot; The New York State Assembly Tenement House Committee report of 1894 surveyed 8,000 buildings with approximately 255,000 residents and found New York to be the most densely populated city in the world, at an average of , with part of the Lower East Side having , denser than Bombay. It used both charts and photographs, the first such official use of photographs. Together with the publication in 1895 by the US Department of Labor of a special report on housing conditions and solutions elsewhere in the world, &quot;The Housing of Working People,&quot; it ultimately led to the passage of the Tenement House Act of 1901, known as the New Law, which implemented the Tenement House Committee&#x27;s recommendation of a maximum of 70 percent lot coverage and mandated strict enforcement, specified a minimum of for a rear yard and for an air and light shaft at the lot line or in the middle of the building (all of these being increased for taller buildings), and required running water and water closets in every apartment and a window in every room. There were also fire-safety requirements. These rules are still the basis of New York City law on low-rise buildings, and they have made single-lot development uneconomical.

Most of the purpose-built tenements in New York were not slums, although they were not pleasant to be inside, especially in hot weather, so people congregated outside, made heavy use of the fire escapes, and slept in summer on fire escapes, roofs, and sidewalks.

The Lower East Side Tenement Museum, a five-story brick former tenement building in Manhattan that is a National Historic Site, is a museum devoted to tenements on the Lower East Side.

Other famous tenements in the US include tenement housing in Chicago, in which various housing areas were built to the same affect as tenements in New York.

===Glasgow and Edinburgh===

Tenements make up a large percentage of the housing stock of Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland. Glasgow tenements were built to provide high-density housing for the large number of people immigrating to the city in the 19th and early 20th century as a result of the Industrial Revolution, when the city&#x27;s population boomed to more than 1 million people. Edinburgh&#x27;s tenements are much older, dating from the 17th century onwards, and some were up to 15 storeys high when first built, which made them among the tallest houses in the world at that time. Glasgow tenements were generally built no taller than the width of the street on which they were located; therefore, most are about 3–5 storeys high. Virtually all Glasgow tenements were constructed using red or blonde sandstone, which has become distinctive.

In Edinburgh, residential dwellings in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the medieval Old Town and Georgian New Town (as well as the Victorian city centre districts immediately surrounding them) are almost exclusively tenements.
The Tenement House historic house museum in the Garnethill area of Glasgow preserves the interior, fittings and equipment of a well-kept, upper middle-class tenement from the late 19th century.

Many tenements in Glasgow were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s because of slum conditions, overcrowding and poor maintenance of the buildings. Perhaps the most striking case of this is seen in the Gorbals, where virtually all the tenements were demolished to make way for tower blocks, many of which have in turn have been demolished and replaced with newer structures. The Gorbals is an area of approximately 1 km2 and at one time had an estimated 90,000 people living in its tenements, leading to very poor living conditions. The population now is roughly 10,000.

Tenement demolition was to a significantly lesser extent in Edinburgh, thus making its later World Heritage designations in 1985 possible. Largely, such clearances were limited to pre-Victorian buildings outside the New Town area and were precipitated by the so-called &quot;Penny Tenement&quot; incident of 1959 in which a tenement collapsed.

Apartments in tenement buildings in both cities are now often highly sought after, due to their locations, often large rooms, high ceilings, ornamentation and period features.

===Berlin===
In German, the term corresponding to &quot;tenement&quot; is &quot;Mietskaserne&quot;, &quot;rental barracks&quot;, and the city especially known for them is Berlin. In 1930, Werner Hegemann&#x27;s polemic &quot;Das steinerne Berlin&quot; (Stony Berlin) referred to the city in its subtitle as &quot;the largest tenement city in the world.&quot; They were built during a period of great increases in population between 1860 and 1914, particularly after German unification in 1871, in a broad ring enclosing the old city center, sometimes called the Wilhelmian or Wilhelmine Ring. The buildings are almost always five stories high because of the mandated maximum height. The blocks are large because the streets were required to be able to handle heavy traffic, and the lots are therefore also large: required to have courtyards large enough for a fire truck to turn around, the buildings have front, rear, and cross buildings enclosing several courtyards. Buildings within the courtyards were the location of much of Berlin&#x27;s industry until the 1920s, and noise and other nuisances affected the apartments, only the best of which had windows facing the street.
One notorious Berlin Mietskaserne was in Gesundbrunnen, which at times housed 2,000 people and required its police officer to keep order.

Between 1901 and 1920, a Berlin clinic investigated and documented in photographs the living conditions of its patients, revealing that many lived in damp basements and garrets, spaces under stairs, and apartments where the windows were blocked by courtyard businesses.

Many apartments in the Wilhelmian Ring were very small, only one room and a kitchen. Also, apartments were laid out with their rooms reached via a common internal corridor, which even the Berlin Architects&#x27; Association recognized was unhealthy and detrimental to family life. Sanitation was inadequate: in a survey of one area in 1962, only 15 percent of apartments had both a toilet and a bath or shower; 19 percent had only a toilet, and 66 percent shared staircase toilets. Heating was provided by stoves burning charcoal briquettes.

===Dublin===
By the 19th and early 20th century, Dublin&#x27;s tenements () were infamous, often described as the worst in Europe. Many tenement buildings were originally the Georgian townhouses of upper-class families, neglected and subdivided over the centuries to house dozens of Dublin&#x27;s poor. Henrietta Street&#x27;s fifteen buildings housed 835 people. In 1911 nearly 26,000 families lived in inner-city tenements, and 20,000 of these families lived in a single room. Disease was common, with death rates of 22.3 per thousand (compared with 15.6 for London at the same time).

The collapse of 65–66 Church Street in 1913, which killed seven residents, led to inquiries into housing. A housing committee report of 1914 said,
Tenement life often appeared in fiction, such as the &quot;Dublin trilogy&quot; of plays by Seán O&#x27;Casey, Oliver St. John Gogarty&#x27;s play &quot;Blight&quot;, and James Plunkett&#x27;s novel &quot;Strumpet City&quot; (adapted for television in 1980). 14 Henrietta Street serves as a museum of Dublin tenement life.

The last tenements were closed in the 1970s, families being rehoused in new suburbs such as Ballymun.

===Buenos Aires===

In Buenos Aires, the tenements, called &quot;conventillos&quot;, developed from subdividing one- or two-story houses built around courtyards for well-off families. These were long and narrow, three to six times as long as they were wide, and the size of the patios was reduced until as many as 350 people could be living on a lot that had originally housed 25. Purpose-built tenements copied their form. By 1907 there were some 2,500 conventillos, with 150,000 occupants. El conventillo de la Paloma was particularly famous and is the title of a play by Alberto Vaccarezza.

=== Montevideo ===

In Montevideo, Uruguay, the tenements, called &quot;conventillos,&quot; emerged from the end of the 19th century, due to the rapid increase in the city&#x27;s population caused by the massive arrival of immigrants and the settlement of people from other areas of the country, especially from the countryside. They were located mainly in the southwestern neighborhoods of Ciudad Vieja, Palermo and Barrio Sur.

They were inhabited by low-income and working-class people, including Italian and Spanish immigrants, Sephardic Jews and Afro-Uruguayans. The now demolished &quot;Conventillo Mediomundo&quot; located in Barrio Sur was one of the most emblematic, as it was a central hub for the Afro-Uruguayan community and for candombe music and dance.

In the &quot;conventillos&quot;, social gatherings were organized where tango was danced, which arose from the mixture of the different cultures of the working class people who lived in these collective dwellings.

===Mumbai===
&quot;Chawls&quot; are found in India. They are typically four to five story buildings with 10 to 20 &quot;kholis&quot; (tenements) on each floor, kholis literally meaning &#x27;rooms&#x27;. Many chawl buildings can be found in Mumbai, where chawls were constructed by the thousands to house people migrating to the large city because of its booming cotton mills and overall strong economy.

A typical chawl tenement consists of one all-purpose room, which functions both as a living and sleeping space, and a kitchen which also serves as a dining room. A frequent practice is for the kitchen to also serve as a bedroom for a newly married couple in order to give them some degree of privacy.

===Poland===
Kamienica (plural &quot;kamienice&quot;) is a Polish term describing a type of residential tenement building made of brick or stone, with at least two floors. There are two basic types: one designed as a single-family residence, which existed until the 1800s (a burgher house), and the other designed as multi-family housing, which emerged in the 19th century and was the basic type of housing in cities. From the architectural point of view, the word is usually used to describe a building that abuts other similar buildings forming the street frontage, in the manner of a terraced house. The ground floor often consists of shops and other businesses, while the upper floors are apartments, oftentimes spanning the entire floor. Kamienice have large windows in the front, but not in the side walls, since the buildings are close together. 

The first type of kamienica is most prevalent especially in centers of historical cities such as Kraków, Poznań, Wrocław, and Toruń, whereas the second type is most prominent in Łódź. City which is known for beautiful kamienice in Art Nouveau style is Bydgoszcz. The name derives from the Polish word &quot;kamień&quot; (stone) and dates from the 15th century. Late 19th century and early 20th century kamienice often took form of city palaces with ornamental facades, high floors and spacious, representative and heavily decorated interiors. 

Later in the 20th century, especially after the Second World War, large apartments would be divided into several smaller flats due to general lack of habitable space caused by vast destruction of cities, thus lowering the generally high standard of living in so-called grand city tenements (). Examples of kamienice include Korniakt Palace and Black Kamienica in Lviv.

<text>The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) is the provincial police service for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary is one of three provincial police forces in Canada, alongside the Ontario Provincial Police and the . Uniquely, the responsibility for policing in Newfoundland and Labrador is not granted to municipalities. In Ontario and Quebec, the provincial police provide frontline police services only to small communities or at the request of a municipal council; in Newfoundland and Labrador, the Constabulary operates in all communities by default. Since 1949, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have provided police services in the province&#x27;s rural interior, in place of the RNC.

As of 2023, the Constabulary currently serves or is expanding to serve the northeast Avalon Peninsula (metropolitan St. John&#x27;s); the Bay of Islands and the Humber Valley (metropolitan Corner Brook); and western Labrador (Churchill Falls, Labrador City, and Wabush).

==History==
The first police constables in Newfoundland and Labrador were appointed by Governor Henry Osborn to six separate judicial districts in 1729. In the 19th century, the RNC was modeled after the Royal Irish Constabulary with the secondment in 1844 of Timothy Mitchell to be Inspector General. The administration of police services was centralized under one Inspector and General Superintendent of Police in 1853. Legislation governing the Newfoundland Constabulary was passed by the House of Assembly in 1871.

In January 1909, John J. Sullivan became the first Newfoundland-born police chief of the Constabulary, a post he held until September 1917.

In 1935, the Newfoundland Commission of Government established the Newfoundland Ranger Force, a police service modelled on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to serve rural parts of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Ranger Force replaced the Newfoundland Constabulary outside of the Avalon Peninsula, the Humber Arm (and in particular, the four communities that make up present-day Corner Brook), Grand Falls, and other built-up communities on the island.

During World War II, the Newfoundland Constabulary provided police and investigative services to the foreign militaries stationed at St. John&#x27;s, famously investigating the 1942 Knights of Columbus Hostel fire, a fatal structure fire believed to have been an arson attack.

After Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949, the Ranger Force was disbanded and replaced by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which also replaced the Newfoundland Constabulary outside of the City of St. John&#x27;s.

In 1979, Queen Elizabeth II of Canada conferred a royal patronage on the Newfoundland Constabulary in recognition of its long history of service to Newfoundland and Labrador. The force subsequently changed its name to the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary.

The first women were sworn in as constables in 1980.

Between 1981 and 1986, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary gradually re-expanded, replacing the RCMP in the northeast Avalon Region, parts of Labrador, and Corner Brook.

In 1998, RNC officers were authorized to begin carrying their handguns on their belt. Previously, officers were required to keep their firearms locked in the trunk of their car unless they were needed.

On May 3, 2005, the RNC made a formal exchange of colours with the Garda Síochána, one of two successor forces to the Royal Irish Constabulary. The exchange of colours was to mark the historic links between policing in Newfoundland and Ireland.

In 2019, the force hired its first Black police officers, Paul Growns and Jevaughn Coley.

In 2022, the Constabulary sparked controversy after it was revealed that a constable facing four domestic violence-related charges was granted the Chief of Police&#x27;s Commendation, which recognizes &quot;distinguished, commendable act of police duty or outstanding contribution to the RNC,&quot; during her criminal trial.

In 2023, the Constabulary re-expanded again, replacing the RCMP in the areas surrounding Corner Brook, to Pasadena in the northeast and the Bay of Islands in the west.

==Operations==
The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary operates out of five police stations, referred to as regional offices or detachments:
* St. John&#x27;s - serves as the Constabulary&#x27;s headquarters
* Conception Bay South - Detachment (of the St. John&#x27;s Regional Office)
* Churchill Falls - Detachment (of the Labrador West Regional Office)
* Corner Brook - Regional Office
* Labrador City / Wabush (Labrador West) - Regional Office

The Constabulary also maintains a satellite office of the St. John&#x27;s Regional Office in Mount Pearl.

===Organizational structure===

===Specialized units===
The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary maintains several specialized investigative and response units, including a tactical response team, criminal and general investigations units, a police dogs unit, a marine unit, a public order unit, and a collision reconstruction team.

====Mounted unit====
The RNC has operated a mounted unit since 1873.

The current horse-mounted team was created in 2003, replacing a voluntary unit. The unit&#x27;s history can be traced back to three earlier units, the Newfoundland Constabulary Mounted Force 1873–1894, New Fire Brigade Mounted Force 1895–1922, and Newfoundland Constabulary 1922–1951.

The unit has four Percheron horses:

* Dr. Rich
* Townshend
* Fraize
* Dobbin

==Fleet==

The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary maintains a fleet of vehicles of models from several major automakers, such as models including but not limited to the following:


* Other vehicles are commissioned for special purposes, such as the Tactics and Rescue Unit (TRU), Dog Services, Mounted Unit Transport, and Evidence Collection.
* 29-foot Mercury Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) with twin 200HP engines
* The RNC has no helicopters, and instead relies on the RCMP to provide police helicopter services.

==Equipment==

As a result of the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Arming Policy of the RNC, members on operational duty were permitted to wear sidearms starting 14 June 1998. Previously, members were required to keep all firearms secured in the trunk of the police cruiser and were only deployed with permission from the Chief.

<text>The Rose d&#x27;Or (&#x27;Golden Rose&#x27;) is an international awards festival in entertainment broadcasting and programming. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) first acquired the Rose d&#x27;Or in 1961, when it was created by Swiss Television in the lakeside city of Montreux. The awards stayed with the EBU for almost 40 years. The EBU re-acquired the awards in 2013 and successfully re-launched the event that year in Brussels, then relocated to Berlin from 2014 to 2018.

In 2014 the event took place on 17 September in Berlin, Germany. For the first time in its 53-year history, the competition categories were extended to include radio and online video programmes in addition to the traditional focus on television. Producers, executives from independent and public service broadcasters and heads of production companies from several countries took part.

In 2019 the EBU partnered with international publishing company and digital channels business C21Media to take over the organisation of the Rose d&#x27;Or Awards. The 60th Rose d&#x27;Or was held virtually in November 2021.

==Format==
Categories for the 2020 awards:
# Comedy: scripted and non-scripted comedy shows including sketch shows, panel, improvisation, clips, comedy specials and stand-up. Series or single programmes.
# Comedy Drama and Sitcom: scripted comedy series or one-off dramas, involving regular characters in various situations.
# Drama: scripted series or one-off dramas involving characters in various situations. A main plot can be resolved within a single episode or over a series.
# Soap or Telenovela: best multi-episode popular drama or melodrama, either on-going or limited run.

# Innovation in the time of Covid: Award for the programme or series, that, against all the odds, defined what television can achieve – and how television can be produced – in a time of unprecedented crisis.

In addition, the Rose d&#x27;Or recognises significant individual achievements by awarding one trophy each for:
* Emerging Talent Award: the Organiser, in consultation with the panel of judges, will present this award to a new talent who has made a breakthrough performance in a programme or series in the past year. 
* Performance of the Year: the Organiser, in consultation with the panel of judges, will present this award to a personality who has made an outstanding performance in a programme or series in the past year.
* Lifetime Achievement: the Organiser, in consultation with the panel of judges will award the Lifetime Achievement to a personality who has made an outstanding and extensive contribution to the world of entertainment including, but not exclusively, their work in television, audio or online media.

The ultimate accolade for a programme or series, The Golden Rose, awarded to the programme, series or individual that, in the opinion of the judges, has made the outstanding contribution of 2020.

==History==
The festival was founded by Marcel Bezençon, who was inspired by the need of what was then a small group of international colleagues to find programmes to fill their summer schedules. He had the idea that Switzerland could produce an entertainment programme, which could then be swapped with programmes from other national broadcasters. The festival was held in the spring to have programmes ready for broadcast in the summer, and the Golden Rose awards established as an extra incentive. As the festival grew, programme swaps ceased to be viable and the concept of the Film Kiosk was born. The awards became an important part of European television culture, and Golden Rose winners usually receive publicity in their home countries.

<text>The Badìa Fiorentina is an abbey and church now home to the Monastic Communities of Jerusalem situated on the Via del Proconsolo in the centre of Florence, Italy. Dante supposedly grew up across the street in what is now called the , rebuilt in 1910 as a museum to Dante (though in reality unlikely to be his real home). He would have heard the monks singing the Mass and the Offices here in Latin Gregorian chant, as he famously recounts in his &quot;Commedia&quot;: &quot;Florence, within her ancient walls embraced, Whence nones and terce still ring to all the town, Abode aforetime, peaceful, temperate, chaste.&quot; In 1373, Boccaccio delivered his famous lectures on Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; in the subsidiary chapel of Santo Stefano, just next to the north entrance of the Badia&#x27;s church.

==History==
The abbey was founded as a Benedictine institution in 978 by , in commemoration of her late husband Hubert, and was one of the chief buildings of medieval Florence. A hospital was founded in the abbey in 1071. The church bell marked the main divisions of the Florentine day. Between 1284 and 1310 the Romanesque church was rebuilt in Gothic style by famous Italian architect and sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio, but in 1307 part of the church was demolished to punish the monks for non-payment of taxes. The church underwent a Baroque transformation between 1627 and 1631. The prominent campanile, completed between 1310 and 1330, is Romanesque at its base and Gothic in its upper stages. Its construction was overseen by the famous chronicler Giovanni Villani.

Today the Badia is the home to a congregation of monks and nuns known as the Fraternità di Gerusalemme. They have sung vespers at 6pm and mass at 6:30pm every day. Locals and tourists alike claim attending their Vespers or Mass to be one of the most beautiful experiences in Florence.

The legend tells that Dante saw for the first time Beatrice in this church.

==Artworks==
Major works of art in the church include the &quot;Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard&quot; (c. 1486) by Filippino Lippi (originally commissioned by Piero del Pugliese for his chapel at or delle Campora) and the tombs of Willa&#x27;s son Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany (died 1001) and the lawyer and diplomat (1396–1456), both by Mino da Fiesole (latter completed c. 1466). The murals in the apse were completed by Giovanni Domenico Ferretti in 1734.

The attached Chiostro degli Aranci (Cloister of the Oranges) contains a fresco cycle (c. 1435–1439) on the life of St Benedict, rooted in the context of the Badia&#x27;s revitalizing by a prominent monastic reformer of Portuguese origin, Abbot Dom Gomes Eanes (OSB) (&quot;Beato Gomezio&quot; in the contemporary Italian sources) (c. 1383–1459). Many attribute the frescos to the Portuguese painter Giovanni di Consalvo, a generally unknown follower of Fra Angelico. They are more likely the work of Zanobi di Benedetto Strozzi (1412–68) under the guidance of Angelico himself. The fourth scene in the cycle was repainted c. 1526-1528 (&quot;St. Benedict chastising himself&quot;) by the young Bronzino. The cloister itself was built under the direction of Antonio di Domenico della Parte and Giovanni d&#x27;Antonio da Maiano, with some assistance by Bernardo Rossellino.

The Badia Polyptych by Giotto, now at the Uffizi Gallery, was originally located in the church. In 1940, during the safe hiding of various works during World War II, Ugo Procacci noticed the polyptych being carried out of the Santa Croce basilica. He reasoned that it had been removed from the Badia during the Napoleonic occupation and accidentally re-installed at Santa Croce. Procacci also realized that the altarpiece was too large for the site of the current altar at the Badia. He discovered that a 1628 renovation had resulted in a change of the altar&#x27;s location, as well as the demolishment of two and a half walls at the original site. The remaining left half of the rear wall had been covered by a new wall. As the polyptych was being restored in 1958, Procacci had a hole chiseled at the top of the more recent wall and found that the original wall was frescoed. The later wall was removed over six months, and three scenes were revealed: an &quot;Annunciation&quot;, a &quot;Presentation of Jesus at the Temple&quot; and &quot;Joachim Among the Shepherds&quot;. However, all but one head depicted in the frescoes, that of a shepherd, had been removed in the 1628 renovation.

<text>Lexmark International, Inc. is a privately held American company that manufactures laser printers and imaging products. The company is headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky. Since 2016 it has been jointly owned by a consortium of three multinational companies: Ninestar (formerly Apex Technology), PAG Asia Capital, and Legend Capital. It was announced Dec. 23, 2024 that Xerox will acquire Lexmark for $1.5 billion.

==History==

Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991, when investment firm Clayton &amp; Dubilier completed a leveraged buyout of IBM Information Products Corporation, the printer, typewriter, and keyboard operations of IBM. Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995 (under NYSE:LXK).

By 2016, the company struggled to keep corporate clients that are cutting costs and the consumers who are shifting to mobile devices from personal computers. It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be taken private and acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for US$3.6 billion. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction. Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015. The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and &quot;rebranded&quot; to Kofax. As part of the sale, the Perceptive Business Unit portion of Lexmark&#x27;s Enterprise Software Services division (e.g., their non-Kofax-branded document management products) was sold to the Thoma Bravo management group who agreed to in-turn sell the Perceptive Business Unit to the Hyland Corporation. The Kofax-branded applications remained as part of Lexmark, but other document management systems like Perceptive Content and NolijWeb and products like Intelligent Capture (formerly &quot;Brainware&quot;) and Enterprise Search (formerly &quot;ISYS&quot;) were absorbed by Hyland.

Late December 2024 Lexmark announced that Xerox would be buying the company, with the deal expected to close in the second half of 2025.

==Operations==
The firm&#x27;s corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and R&amp;D offices are distributed globally with additional R&amp;D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado, US; Lenexa, Kansas, US; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden and Irvine, California, US. Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. As of July 2018, the company had approximately 9,000 employees worldwide.

==Acquisitions==
* In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings. Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (&quot;Perceptive Content&quot;, ″ImageNow&quot;) and document output management applications.
* In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million. The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management, document output management and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark&#x27;s services.
* In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million. Brainware&#x27;s intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers&#x27; data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
* In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million. ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
* In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.
* In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.
* In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.
* In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR, a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.
* In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million. ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.
* In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion. Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, US was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations. This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.

==Divestitures==
* In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line. In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark&#x27;s inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark&#x27;s inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.
* In 1996, Lexmark International was prepared to shut their Lexington keyboard factory where they produced Model M buckling-spring keyboards. IBM, their principal customer—and the Model M&#x27;s original designer and patent holder—had decided to remove the Model M from its product line in favor of cheaper Asian-made rubber-dome keyboards. Rather than seeing its production come to an end, a group of former Lexmark and IBM employees purchased the factory and, in April 1996, reestablished the business as Unicomp, making their own modernized versions of the Model M keyboard.

==Legal cases==
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.

&quot;Arizona Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass&#x27;n Inc. v. Lexmark International Inc.&quot;, also referred to as &quot;ACRA v. Lexmark&quot;, was a 2005 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that an End User License Agreement on a physical box can be binding on consumers who signal their acceptance of the agreement simply by opening the box. The decision holds that Lexmark can enforce the &quot;single use only&quot; policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them (so that the cartridges would not be diverted, refilled, and then resold), or else face legal liability for not returning them to the company as agreed.

Lexmark had introduced various authentication mechanisms into their printers that rejected third-party cartridges and resisted any attempt to refill spent ones. ACRA, a consumer group representing manufacturers of third-party authentication microchips and third-party ink and toner cartridges, had challenged this policy as deceptive and unenforceable. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, allowing Lexmark to prevent the use of third-party cartridges and the re-use of empty ones. These restrictions are achieved with a combination of encryption hardware within the cartridges and printer firmware that attempts to verify their authenticity as being first-party (i.e. manufactured or distributed by Lexmark). The firmware tracks cartridge ink levels, and will permanently disable any cartridge that it has determined to have been refilled, regardless of whether it actually has been.

Subsequent challenges to the &quot;single use only&quot; policy were more successful. Lexmark lost the Supreme Court case &quot;Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.&quot;, in a 7–1 ruling that partially reversed and remanded the Ninth Circuit decision in &quot;ACRA v. Lexmark&quot; on May 30, 2017:

The decision holds that Lexmark cannot sue third-party manufacturers or resellers for patent infringement; notably, it does not mean that Lexmark cannot use firmware to detect, reject or disable third-party ink cartridges or attempted refills. As of 2024, the company continues to do so.

In 2023, Ninestar, a majority owner of Lexmark, was banned from importing goods into the United States under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. While Lexmark claimed their investors had no operational control over Ninestar, they did not respond to whether Lexmark sources products from Ninestar.

<doc id="854781" wikidata="Q322030" url="?curid=854781" title="Eugène Atget">
<text>Eugène Atget (; 12 February 1857 – 4 August 1927) was a French &quot;flâneur&quot; and a pioneer of documentary photography, noted for his determination to document all of the architecture and street scenes of Paris before their disappearance to modernization. Most of his photographs were first published by Berenice Abbott after his death. Though he sold his work to artists and craftspeople, and became an inspiration for the surrealists, he did not live to see the wide acclaim his work would eventually receive.

==Biography==
=== Early years ===
Jean-Eugène-Auguste Atget was born 12 February 1857 in Libourne. His father, carriage builder Jean-Eugène Atget, died in 1862, and his mother, Clara-Adeline Atget née Hourlier died shortly after; he was an orphan at age seven. He was brought up by his maternal grandparents in Bordeaux and after finishing secondary education joined the merchant navy.

=== Moving to Paris ===
Atget moved to Paris in 1878. He failed the entrance exam for acting class but was admitted when he had a second try. Because he was drafted for military service he could attend class only part-time, and he was expelled from drama school.

Still living in Paris, he became an actor with a travelling group, performing in the Paris suburbs and the provinces. He met actress Valentine Delafosse Compagnon, who became his companion until her death in 1926. He gave up acting because of an infection of his vocal cords in 1887, moved to the provinces and took up painting without success. When he was thirty he made his first photographs, of Amiens and Beauvais, which date from 1888.

=== Photography and documents for artists ===
In 1890, Atget moved back to Paris and became a professional photographer, supplying &quot;documents&quot; for artists: studies for painters, architects, and stage designers.

Starting in 1898, institutions such as the Musée Carnavalet and the Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris bought his photographs. The latter commissioned him ca. 1906 to systematically photograph old buildings in Paris. In 1899 he moved to Montparnasse.

While being a photographer Atget still called himself an actor, giving lectures and readings.

During World War I Atget temporarily stored his archives in his basement for safekeeping and almost completely gave up photography. Valentine&#x27;s son Léon was killed at the front.

In 1920–21, he sold thousands of his negatives to institutions. Financially independent, he took up photographing the parks of Versailles, Saint-Cloud and Sceaux and produced a series of photographs of prostitutes.

=== Later years and creative heritage ===
Berenice Abbott, while working with Man Ray, visited Atget in 1925, bought some of his photographs, and tried to interest other artists in his work. She continued to promote Atget through various articles, exhibitions and books, and sold her Atget collection to the Museum of Modern Art in 1968.

In 1926, Atget&#x27;s partner Valentine died, and before he saw the full-face and profile portraits that Abbott took of him in 1927, showing him “slightly stooped…tired, sad, remote, appealing”, Atget died on 4 August in 1927, in Paris.

=== Atget and biographical myth ===
At the moment, not many reliable facts from Atget’s life are known. It is believed that Atget was poor, while at the same time, there is an assumption that the photographer’s cramped financial circumstances are a myth established by later researchers in attempts to create the image of a romantic artist. In his research, John Szarkowski cited a fragment of Atget’s correspondence with Paul Leon, a professor at the Collège de France, an employee of the Commission on Historical Monuments and one of the top officials of the French Ministry of Culture (French), from which it follows that they sold 2,600 negatives for 10,000 francs. This is one of the largest, but not the only lifetime sales of Atget.

==Photographic practice==
=== The beginning of photography and photography of Paris ===
Atget took up photography in the late 1880s, around the time that photography was experiencing unprecedented expansion in both commercial and amateur fields.

Atget photographed Paris with a large-format wooden bellows camera with a rapid rectilinear lens, an instrument that was fairly current when he took it up, but which he continued to use even when hand-held and more efficient large-format cameras became available. The optical vignetting often seen at some corners of his photographs is due to his having repositioned the lens relative to the plate on the camera—exploiting one of the features of bellows view cameras as a way to correct perspective and control perspective and keep vertical forms straight. The negatives show four small clear rebates (printing black) where clips held the glass in the plate-holder during exposure. The glass plates were 180×240mm &quot;Bande Bleue&quot; (Blue Ribbon) brand with a general purpose gelatin-silver emulsion, fairly slow, that necessitated quite long exposures, resulting in the blurring of moving subjects seen in some of his pictures. Interest in Atget&#x27;s work has prompted the recent scientific analysis of Atget&#x27;s negatives and prints in Parisian collections and in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

=== Specifics of the technique ===
In &quot;Intérieurs Parisiens&quot;, a series of photographs he took for the Bibliotéque Nationale, he included a view of his own simple darkroom with trays for processing negatives and prints, a safelight, and printing frames. After taking a photograph, Atget would develop, wash, and fix his negative, then assign the negative to one of his filing categories with the next consecutive number that he would write the negative number in graphite on the verso of the negative and also scratch it into the emulsion. He contact-printed his negatives onto pre-sensitized, commercially available printing-out papers; albumen paper, gelatin-silver printing-out paper, or two types of matte albumen paper that he used mainly after WW1. The negative was clamped into a printing frame under glass and against a sheet of albumen photographic printing out paper, which was left out in the sun to expose. The frame permitted inspection of the print until a satisfactory exposure was achieved, then Atget washed, fixed and toned his print with gold toner, as was the standard practice when he took up photography.

Atget did not use an enlarger, and all of his prints are the same size as their negatives. Prints would be numbered and labelled on their backs in pencil then inserted by the corners into four slits cut in each page of albums. Additional albums were assembled based on a specific themes that might be of interest to his clients, and separate from series or chronology.

=== Features and specifics of photographic practice ===
One of the main issues related to Atget’s work is the nature and specificity of his legacy. Some researchers consider him, first of all, the author of romantic Parisian views. Other researchers believe that the size of the archive is important in assessing his work—the entire corpus of 10 thousand photographs, and not just individual photographs. It is believed that the meaning of his activity is not only in the creation of individual images, but also in the formation of a sequential series of images. In this case, it is important to have an exceptional number of photographs (about 10 thousand), as well as the use of a systematic archival principle. The idea of a work as a community was used by Maria Morris Hamburg and John Szarkowski when preparing a landmark exhibition at MOMA This idea has been supported by researchers such as Rosalind Krauss and other experts.

== Subject matter ==

By 1891 Atget advertised his business with a shingle at his door, remarked later by Berenice Abbott, that announced “Documents pour Artistes”. Initially his subjects were flowers, animals, landscapes, and monuments; sharp and meticulous studies centred simply in the frame and intended for artists&#x27; use. 
Atget then embarked on a series of picturesque views of Paris which include documentation of the small trades in his series &quot;Petits Métiers&quot;. He made views of gardens in the areas surrounding Paris, in the summer of 1901, photographing the gardens at Versailles, a challenging subject of large scale and with combinations of natural and architectural and sculptural elements which he would revisit until 1927, learning to make balanced compositions and perspectives.

Early in the 1900s, Atget began to document “Old Paris,” reading extensively in order to sympathetically focus on Paris architecture and environments dating prior to the French Revolution, concern over the preservation of which ensured him commercial success. He framed the winding streets to show the historic buildings in context, rather than making frontal architectural elevations.

Atget&#x27;s specialisation in imagery of Old Paris expanded his clientele. Amongst his scant surviving documents was his notebook, known by the word &quot;Repertoire&quot; on its cover (the French &quot;repertoire&quot; meaning a thumb-indexed address book or directory, but also defined, aptly in actor Atget&#x27;s case, as &#x27;a stock of plays, dances, or items that a company or a performer knows or is prepared to perform&#x27;). The book is now in the MoMA collection, and in it he recorded the names and addresses of 460 clients; architects, interior decorators, builders and their artisans skilled in ironwork, wood panelling, door knockers, also painters, engravers, illustrators, and set designers, jewellers René Lalique and Weller, antiquarians and historians, artists including Tsuguharu Foujita, Maurice de Vlaminck and Georges Braque, well-known authors, editors, publishers Armand Colin and Hachette, and professors, including the many who donated their own collections of his photographs to institutions. The address book lists also contacts at publications, such as L’Illustration, Revue Hebdomadaire, &quot;Les Annales politiques et litteraires&quot;, and &quot;l’Art et des artistes&quot;. Institutional collectors of Old Paris documents, including archives, schools, and museums were also a keen clientele and brought him commercial success, with commissions from the Bibliotèque Historique de la Ville de Paris in 1906 and 1911 and the sale of various albums of photographs to the Bibliotèque Nationale

Atget&#x27;s photographs attracted the attention of, and were purchased by, artists such as Henri Matisse, Marcel Duchamp and Picasso in the 1920s, as well as Maurice Utrillo, Edgar Degas and André Derain, some of whose views are seen from identical vantage-points at which Atget took pictures, and were likely made with the assistance of his photographs bought from the photographer for a few cents.

By the end of his career, Atget had worked methodically and concurrently on thirteen separate series of photographs including &#x27;Landscape Documents&#x27;, &#x27;Picturesque Paris&#x27;, &#x27;Art in Old Paris&#x27;, &#x27;Environs&#x27;, &#x27;Topography of Old Paris&#x27;, &#x27;Tuileries&#x27;, &#x27;Vielle France&#x27;, &#x27;Interiors&#x27;, &#x27;Saint Cloud&#x27;, &#x27;Versailles&#x27;, &#x27;Parisian Parks&#x27;, &#x27;Sceaux&#x27; and a smaller series on costumes and religious arts, returning to subjects after they had been put aside for many years.

==Atget and the concept of a work of art==
=== Atget and the problem of the archive ===
The principle of the archive is considered as the basis of the artistic program by many researchers of Atget&#x27;s work.
The research of Maria Morris Hamburg and John Szarkowski corrected the understanding of Atget&#x27;s program. It implied that the photographer was not creating a pictorial monolith, but a catalog that was part of the artistic and semantic system of his photographs. This circumstance allows us to perceive Atget’s works as an example of a specific artistic program and consider them as an example of non-logical forms in photography.

=== Atget&#x27;s photographs: the problem of the work of art ===
One of the central problems associated with Atget&#x27;s work is determining the balance between fiction and documentary. Atget created his photographs as utilitarian materials (documents for artists or archival images of Parisian monuments) - their artistic status was partly the result of later readings. Rosalind Krauss draws attention to the fact that the central theme associated with Atget’s works is the uncertainty of the boundaries of the work. It is not entirely clear what should be considered a master’s work—a single selected frame or a complete corpus of several thousand images. Atget&#x27;s photographs highlighted the problem of the singularity of the work and questioned the possibility of its integrity and semantic completeness.

== Surrealist appropriation ==
Man Ray, who lived on the same street as Atget in Paris, the rue Campagne-Première in Montparnasse purchased and collected almost fifty of Atget&#x27;s photographs into an album embossed with the name &#x27;Atget&#x27;, &quot;coll. Man Ray&quot; and a date, 1926. He published several of Atget&#x27;s photographs in his &quot;La Révolution surréaliste;&quot; most famously in issue number 7, of 15 June 1926, his &quot;Pendant l’éclipse&quot; made fourteen years earlier and showing a crowd gathered at the Colonne de Juillet to peer through various devices, or through their bare fingers, at the Solar eclipse of 17 April 1912. Atget however did not regard himself as a Surrealist. When Ray asked Atget if he could use his photo, Atget said: &quot;Don&#x27;t put my name on it. These are simply documents I make.&quot; Man Ray proposed that Atget&#x27;s pictures of staircases, doorways, ragpickers, and especially those with window reflections (when foreground and background mix and mannequins looks like ready to step out), had a Dada or Surrealist quality about them.

Abigail Solomon Godeau referred to part of Atget&#x27;s photos as surrealist .

==Atget and Walter Benjamin==
One of the earliest analytical texts about Atget is Walter Benjamin&#x27;s essay A Brief History of Photography (1931). Benjamin views Atget as a forerunner of surrealist photography, effectively making him a member of the European avant-garde. In his understanding, Atget is a representative of a new photographic vision, and not a master of idyllic photographs of 19th-century Paris. He names Atget as the discoverer of the fragment that will become the central motif of the New Vision photograph. Benjamin draws attention to the fact that Atget liberates photography from the aura that was characteristic of both early 19th-century photography and classical works of art in particular. Thus, Walter Benjamin denotes the direction of research into the frame and technical arts, which he will continue in his essay The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.

==Recognition in America==
After Atget&#x27;s death his friend, the actor André Calmettes, sorted his work into two categories; 2,000 records of historic Paris, and photographs of all other subjects. The former, he gave to the French government; the others he sold to the American photographer Berenice Abbott,

Atget created a comprehensive photographic record of the look and feel of nineteenth-century Paris just as it was being dramatically transformed by modernization, and its buildings were being systematically demolished.

When Berenice Abbott reportedly asked him if the French appreciated his art, he responded ironically, &quot;No, only young foreigners.&quot; While Ray and Abbott claimed to have &#x27;discovered&#x27; him around 1925, he was certainly not the unknown &#x27;primitive&#x27; &#x27;tramp&#x27; or &#x27;Douanier Rousseau of the street&#x27; that they took him for; he had, since 1900, as counted by Alain Fourquier, 182 reproductions of 158 images in 29 publications and had sold, between 1898 and 1927 and beyond the postcards he published, sometimes more than 1000 pictures a year to public institutions including the Bibliothèque Nationale, Bibliothèque Historique de la Ville de Paris, Musée Carnavalet, Musée de Sculpture Comparé, École des Beaux-Arts, the Directorate of Fine Arts and others.

During the Depression in the 1930s Abbott sold half of her collection to Julian Levy, who owned a gallery in New York. Since he had difficulty selling the prints, he allowed Abbott to keep them in her possession. In the late 1960s Abbott and Levy sold the collection of Atgets to The Museum of Modern Art. As MoMA bought it, the collection contained 1415 glass negatives and nearly 8,000 vintage prints from over 4,000 distinct negatives.

The publication of his work in the United States after his death and the promotion of his work to English-speaking audiences was due to Berenice Abbott. She exhibited, printed and wrote about his work, and assembled a substantial archive of writings about his portfolio by herself and others. Abbott published &quot;Atget, Photographe de Paris&quot; in 1930, the first overview of his photographic oeuvre and the beginning of his international fame. She also published a book with prints she made from Atget&#x27;s negatives: &quot;The World of Atget&quot; (1964). &quot;Berenice Abbott and Eugene Atget&quot; was published in 2002.

As the city and architecture are two main themes in Atget&#x27;s photographs, his work has been commented on and reviewed together with the work of Berenice Abbott and Amanda Bouchenoire, in the book &quot;Architecture and Cities. Three Photographic Gazes&quot;, where author Jerome Saltz analyzes historicist perspectives and considers their aesthetic implications: &quot;(...) the three authors coincide in the search for and exaltation of intrinsic beauty in their objectives, regardless of quality and clarity of their references.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In 1929, eleven of Atget&#x27;s photographs were shown at the &quot;Film und Foto&quot; Werkbund exhibition in Stuttgart.

The U.S. Library of Congress has some 20 prints made by Abbott in 1956. The Museum of Modern Art purchased the Abbott/Levy collection of Atget&#x27;s work in 1968. MoMA published a four-volume series of books based on its four successive exhibitions of Atget&#x27;s life and work, between 1981 and 1985.

In 2001, the Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired the Julien Levy Collection of Photographs, the centerpiece of which includes 361 photographs by Atget. Many of these photographs were printed by Atget himself and purchased by Levy directly from the photographer. Others arrived in Levy&#x27;s possession when he and Berenice Abbott entered a partnership to preserve Atget&#x27;s studio in 1930. Eighty-three prints in the Levy Collection were made by Abbott posthumously as exhibition prints that she produced directly from Atget&#x27;s glass negatives. Additionally, the Levy Collection included three of Atget&#x27;s photographic albums, crafted by the photographer himself. The most complete is an album of domestic interiors titled &quot;Intérieurs Parisiens Début du XXe Siècle, Artistiques, Pittoresques &amp; Bourgeois&quot;. The other two albums are fragmentary. &quot;Album No. 1, Jardin des Tuileries&quot; has only four pages still intact, and the other lacks a cover and title but contains photographs from numerous Parisian parks. In total, the Philadelphia Museum of Art holds approximately 489 objects attributed to Atget.

&quot;Atget, a Retrospective&quot; was presented at the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris in 2007.

The Atget crater on the planet Mercury is named after him, as is Rue Eugène-Atget in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.

Although no statement by Atget about his technique or aesthetic approach survives, he did sum up his life&#x27;s work in a letter to the Minister of Fine Arts;

==Copyright==
The U.S. Library of Congress was unable to determine the ownership of the twenty Atget photographs in its collection, thus suggesting that they are technically orphan works. Abbott clearly had a copyright on the selection and arrangement of his photographs in her books, which is now owned by Commerce Graphics. The Library also stated that the Museum of Modern Art, which owns the collection of Atget&#x27;s negatives, reported that Atget had no heirs and that any rights on these works may have expired.

<text>Giovanni Costa (15 October 1826 – 31 January 1903), often known as Nino Costa, was an Italian landscape painter and patriotic revolutionary.

==Biography==
Giovanni Costa was born in Rome on 15 October 1826, the fourteenth of the sixteen children of Gioacchino Costa (died 1842) and Maria Chiappi (died 1857). His father was from Santa Margherita Ligure and as a young man had moved to Rome, where he opened a wool-spinning factory and achieved wealth and position. The family lived in a large house in Piazza San Francesco a Ripa, in Trastevere, close to the factory.

When he was 12 Giovanni was introduced to the neo-classical painter Baron Vincenzo Camuccini, who encouraged him to work from nature and from what he saw around him. Soon after was sent to the Jesuit college at Montefiascone, where remained for five years.

Costa returned to Rome in 1843, the year after the death of this father, and for two years attended the Collegio Bandinelli in the via Giulia, founded by Bartolommeo Bandinelli in 1678, where he was taught drawing by Luigi Durantini. He then worked for short time in the studio of Vincenzo Camuccini before entering the schools of the Accademia di San Luca, where he studied under Francesco Coghetti, Francesco Podesti and Filippo Agricola.

He fought under Garibaldi in 1848, and served as a volunteer in the war of 1859; his enthusiasm for Italian unity was actively shown again in 1870, when he was the first to mount the breach in the assault of Rome near the Porta Pia.

He had settled meanwhile at Florence, where his fight for the independence of art from worn-out traditions was no less strenuous. Here he completed a &quot;Donne sulla spiaggia di Porto d&#x27;Anzio&quot; (Girl on the Beach of Porto d&#x27;Anzio). He also became known as a landscape-painter of remarkable originality, and of great influence in the return to minute observation of nature. He painted, mainly rustic scenes involving herders and cattle. He was a major inspiration to the artists known as the Macchiaioli, and also had many English and American friends and followers, notably Elihu Vedder, Matthew Ridley Corbet (1850–1902) and his wife Edith Corbet, and Lord Carlisle, and was closely associated with Corot and the Barbizon school, whom he met while visiting Paris. In 1853, he established a lifetime friendship with a young Frederick Leighton, who was then sojourning in Rome.

His exile from Rome lasted until 1862. An exhibition of his pictures was held in London in 1904, and he is represented in the Tate Gallery. He died at Marina di Pisa on 31 January 1903.

<doc id="854786" wikidata="Q775576" url="?curid=854786" title="Giant golden-crowned flying fox">
<text>The giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus), also known as the golden-capped fruit bat, is a species of megabat endemic to the Philippines. Since its description in 1831, three subspecies of the giant golden-crowned flying fox have been recognized, one of which is extinct. The extinct subspecies (&quot;A. jubatus lucifer&quot;) was formerly recognized as a full species, the Panay golden-crowned flying fox. Formerly, this species was placed in the genus &quot;Pteropus&quot;; while it is no longer within the genus, it has many physical similarities to &quot;Pteropus&quot; megabats. It is one of the largest bat species in the world, weighing up to —only the Indian and great flying fox can weigh more. It has the longest documented forearm length of any bat species at .

It is primarily frugivorous, consuming several kinds of fig and some leaves. It forages at night and sleeps during the day in tree roosts. These roosts can consist of thousands of individuals, often including another species, the large flying fox. Not much is known about its reproduction; it gives birth annually from April through June, with females having one pup at a time. Predators of the giant golden-crowned flying fox include raptors such as eagles, the reticulated python, and humans.

Owing to deforestation and poaching for bushmeat, it is an endangered species. Though national and international law makes hunting and trade of this species illegal, these regulations are inadequately enforced, meaning that the species is frequently hunted nonetheless. Even in roosts that are more stringently protected from poaching, it is still affected by human disturbance via tourists who intentionally disturb them during the day.

An early description of this species may be found in William Dampier&#x27;s account of his circumnavigation, A New Voyage Round the World.

==Taxonomy==
The giant golden-crowned flying fox was described as a new species in 1831 by German naturalist 
Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz. Eschscholtz placed it in the genus &quot;Pteropus&quot; with a scientific name of &quot;Pteropus jubatus&quot;. Its species name &quot;jubatus&quot; is from Latin, meaning &quot;having a mane or crest, crested&quot;. The holotype had been collected on the Philippine island of Luzon during an expedition led by Otto von Kotzebue.
The genus &quot;Acerodon&quot; was described six years later in 1837, with &quot;A. jubatus&quot; as the type species for the new genus.
As of 2005, three subspecies of the giant golden-crowned flying fox are recognized:
*&quot;A. jubatus jubatus&quot; 
*&quot;A. jubatus mindanensis&quot; 
*&quot;A. jubatus lucifer&quot; 

&quot;A. jubatus lucifer&quot; had been described as &quot;Pteropus lucifer&quot; in 1896 by Daniel Giraud Elliot. &quot;A. jubatus lucifer&quot;, commonly the Panay golden-crowned flying fox, is still sometimes considered an extinct species of megabat. A 1998 publication noted that there were no morphological differences that distinguish &quot;A. jubatus lucifer&quot; from &quot;A. jubatus&quot;. This publication was used by &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; and the IUCN as justification as listing &quot;A. jubatus lucifer&quot; as a subspecies of &quot;A. jubatus&quot; rather than as a full species.

==Description==
Overall, the giant golden-crowned flying fox is similar in appearance to many &quot;Pteropus&quot; species. It is different in its smaller canine teeth and its larger and more complex molars and premolars. Its upper incisors are slightly longer than &quot;Pteropus&quot; species, as well as sharper. Its four lower incisors have a greater disparity in length between the inner and outer pair than do &quot;Pteropus&quot;. Its dental formula is for a total of 34 teeth.
The giant golden-crowned flying fox is one of the largest bat species in the world. It is among the heaviest of all bat species, with individuals weighing up to . The only bat species known to weigh more than the giant golden-crowned flying fox are the Indian flying fox (&quot;Pteropus medius&quot;) and great flying fox (&quot;Pteropus neohibernicus&quot;), with a maximum weight of and respectively. It has the longest forearm length of any species, measuring up to . The great flying fox has a slightly shorter forearm length, and its wingspan is thus presumed to be lesser as well. The wingspan of the Indian flying fox is up to , while the giant golden-crowned flying fox has a wingspan of . This species is somewhat dimorphic, with males slightly larger than females in many cranial and external measurements.

The giant golden-crowned flying fox gets its common name from its fur coloration. It has golden coloration that begins between its eyes and terminates to a narrow &quot;V&quot; shape at the nape of its neck, though sometimes extending to the upper shoulders.
The sides of its face, brows, and throat are black, while the sides of its neck and upper back are maroon; this maroon fur transitions into brownish black, which then grades into reddish brown down the back. On its ventral (belly) side, its fur is generally black, though the front of the neck may have a maroon tinge and its belly may be interspersed with yellow hairs. Its hindlimbs are covered with brownish black fur, and its flight membranes are pale brown.

==Biology and ecology==
===Diet and foraging===

The giant golden-crowned flying fox is largely frugivorous, though it also consumes plant leaves (folivorous). One study found that it is particularly dependent on &quot;Ficus&quot; fruits (figs), with &quot;Ficus&quot; seeds found in 79% of all fecal pellets. Especially common &quot;Ficus&quot; seeds were from the &quot;Urostigma&quot; subgenus (which includes &quot;Ficus&quot; species commonly referred to as banyan), as well as &quot;Ficus variegata&quot;.

The results support that the primary food group is composed of fig species, including &quot;Ficus subcordata&quot; and unidentified leaves. There is a lack of consensus on whether items found frequently in the fecal samples are actually prioritized or found as an alternative food for these bats.

Multiple types of figs can also contribute to different nutrients for the species. Frugivorous bats usually do not consume foods rich in protein. The overconsumption of fruits, paired with leaves may contribute to an adequate amount of protein in their diet. Figs are superior sources of calcium, which may also aid in their growth to adults.

Like nearly all megabats, giant golden-crowned flying foxes cannot echolocate, and thus rely on sight to navigate. This species likely commutes long distances between its roost and foraging grounds. Individuals who roosted on the island of Maripipi, for example, were documented traveling more than to access sites on another island, Biliran.

===Roosting and behavior===
Giant golden-crowned flying foxes are nocturnal, sleeping for most of the day. They do engage in some social and maintenance behaviors during the day at times, with solitary behaviors such as self-grooming, excreting waste, and wing flapping more prevalent in the afternoon and social behaviors such as fighting and mating in the morning. It forms harmonious mixed species colonies with another megabat, the large flying fox (&quot;Pteropus vampyrus&quot;). When time to leave the roosts for nightly foraging, the two species will head in the same direction. In the 1920s, colonies of these two species would number as many as 120,000 individuals. As of 1992, the largest of these colonies was 5,000; many comprised only several hundred individuals.

===Reproduction===
Little is known about mating and reproduction of the giant golden-crowned flying fox.
The litter size is one individual, with females likely producing no more than one litter per year. It has also been speculated that females may only give birth every other year. Based on limited observation, it is thought that females may not reach sexual maturity until two years of age. On Negros Island, females gave birth in April or May; based on other observations, females likely give birth during this time across its range. On the island of Maripipi, young were born in late May and June. This species show signs of a Type II survivorship curve. Parents take effort into the survivability of the offspring to ensure maturity and independent growth. This species may live up to 13–30 years in the wild. Although they typically live a long life in the wild, they are also hunted by humans and other apex predators such as the Philippine eagle. They may also be susceptible to wildlife diseases.
The giant golden-crowned flying fox is impacted by ectoparasites (external parasites) including &quot;Cyclopodia horsfieldi&quot;, which is a species of fly in the family Nycteribiidae (&quot;bat flies&quot;). It is preyed on by several raptors including the Philippine eagle, white-bellied sea eagle, and possibly the Brahminy kite. Non-avian predators include the reticulated python and humans.

Like many bat species, the giant golden-crowned flying fox has been investigated as a source of emerging infectious disease. One study tested for the presence Reston virus, a kind of &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; that affects some primates (though not humans), in a population of giant golden-crowned flying foxes at Subic Bay. Of fifty-six individuals tested for Reston virus, three were seropositive, meaning that they tested positive for antibodies against the virus.

==Range and habitat ==
The giant golden-crowned flying fox is endemic to the Philippines; it was the first endemic species of that country to be described, which it was in 1831. Surveys reported in 2005 and 2011 documented this species on the islands of Bohol, Boracay, Cebu, Leyte, Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Negros and Polillo. It was formerly found on the island of Panay, though this population has been extirpated.

It is a forest specialist, occurring mostly at elevations from sea level to . It prefers areas uninhabited by humans. A 2005 study found none in inhabited areas. The same study also revealed that these bats use river corridors called riparian zones more than originally thought, because the fig trees located near rivers are the bats&#x27; main source of food. They like to be close to agricultural fields, but only in undisturbed forest areas.

==Conservation==
As of 2016, the giant golden-crowned flying fox is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because its population likely declined by more than 50% from 1986–2016. One of the largest factors in its decline is hunting for bushmeat. Its large body size means that it is an easier target than many other bats. The practice of shooting the giant golden-crowned flying fox at its roosts results in excessive mortality, as dead individuals may not fall from the tree, and wounded individuals may glide some distance before falling. Therefore, a poacher may kill as many as thirty bats to recover ten.

The giant golden-crowned flying fox is threatened by deforestation and has completely disappeared from many islands in the Philippines, such as Panay and most of Cebu. Since 1900 the total forest coverage of the Philippines has been reduced from 70% to 20%. Less than 10% of the original lowland forest cover now remains. Negros, an island part of its range, retains only 4% of its original forest coverage.
Internationally, the giant golden-crowned flying fox is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In 1990, two of the three subspecies (&quot;A. j. lucifer&quot; and &quot;A. j. mindanensis&quot;) were included on CITES Appendix II, meaning that trade of the taxa was strictly regulated.
In 1995, the species was placed CITES Appendix I. Appendix I is stricter than Appendix II, meaning that commercial trade of the species is only legal in exceptional circumstances.
Nationally, the species is protected by the 2001 Philippine Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, though this law is inadequately enforced.

While the majority of its roosts are within protected areas, illegal hunting occurs at a wide scale even within such areas. Three are largely protected in practice. On the island of Boracay, local landowners protect the roost from hunting disturbance. The local governments of Subic Bay and Mambukal protect another two roosts. Even though hunting pressures are lessened at these three roosts, the giant golden-crowned flying fox contends with other sources of disturbance. Tourists and their guides deliberately disturb the bats by clapping their hands or rapping on tree trunks to make the bats fly. In addition to keeping the bats from sleeping, these behaviors result in the separation of offspring from their mothers.

In 2013, Bat Conservation International (BCI) listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation.
Actions that BCI has taken to promote its conservation include partnering with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to protect its roosts, as well as educate Filipinos about bats. Some captive breeding programs exist for the species, though it is uncertain if they are sufficient to make up for population declines seen in the wild.

<text>Glyn Maxwell (born 1962) is a British poet, playwright, novelist, librettist, and lecturer.

==Early life==
Of primarily Welsh heritage — his mother Buddug-Mair Powell (b. 1928) acted in the original stage show of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; in the West End and on Broadway in 1956 — Maxwell was born and raised in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire.

His father James Maxwell (1928-2016) was an industrial chemist. Maxwell has two brothers, Alun (b. 1960), and David (b. 1964). His cousin Kerry Lee Powell is a noted Canadian writer.

He studied English at Worcester College, Oxford. He began an MLitt there but dropped out. In 1987 he moved to America to study poetry and drama with Derek Walcott at Boston University. He returned to the UK and began publishing poetry in the 1990s.

After his marriage and the birth of his daughter Alfie in 1997, he moved with his family to the USA, living and teaching at first in Amherst, Massachusetts, and then in New York City. He returned to the UK in 2006.

In the years 1991, 1993 and 1995, Maxwell staged performances of his plays in his parents&#x27; garden in Welwyn Garden City. These were featured in the national press and on radio.

==Poetry==
His three earliest collections of poetry, &quot;Tale Of The Mayor&#x27;s Son&quot; (1990), &quot;Out of the Rain&quot; (1992), &quot;Rest For The Wicked&quot; (1995) are collected as &quot;The Boys at Twilight: Poems 1990-1995&quot; (2000). &quot;The Nerve&quot; won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize in 2004. All his other collections of poems - &quot;The Breakage&quot;, &quot;Hide Now&quot; and &quot;Pluto&quot; - have been shortlisted for either the T.S.Eliot, Forward, or Costa (formerly Whitbread) Prizes. He was awarded the Society of Authors&#x27; Cholmondeley Prize for his poetry in 2014.

In 1994 he was named one of the New Generation poets and he received the E. M. Forster Award in 1997. His most recent collections are &quot;One Thousand Nights and Counting: Selected Poems&quot; and &quot;Pluto&quot;. His work appears in several anthologies of the best of 20th century poetry.

In 1999 Maxwell left Faber and Faber as a result of editorial disagreement over his poem &quot;Time&#x27;s Fool,&quot; and his work has since been published by Picador in the UK. In the US he has been published by Houghton Mifflin and Farrar Straus Giroux.
In 2014 he edited a collected edition of the poems of Derek Walcott, &quot;The Poetry of Derek Walcott 1948–2013&quot;.

His book of poetry, &quot;How The Hell Are You&quot; was published by Picador in 2020.

== Film ==
In 2018, the rights to Maxwell&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Time&#x27;s Fool&quot; (1999) were optioned by the film director Paul King and the screenwriter Jon Croker, and subsequently bought by Fox Searchlight for development as a feature film, with King and Croker as writers, and David Heyman as producer.

Maxwell co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Beast In The Jungle&quot;, a dance-film based on the Henry James novella, with the film&#x27;s director Clara Van Gool. The film premiered at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February 2019. It will also feature at the film festivals of Goteborg, San Francisco, New York and Shanghai.

==Prose==
Maxwell&#x27;s critical guidebook &quot;On Poetry&quot; (Oberon Books, 2012) was described by Adam Newey in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &#x27;the best book about poetry I&#x27;ve ever read&#x27; and by Hugo Williams in &quot;The Spectator&quot; as &#x27;a modern classic&#x27;.

A stand-alone sequel, titled &quot;Drinks With Dead Poets: The Autumn Term&quot; and set in a mysterious village, was published by Oberon in October 2016. In this &#x27;brilliantly unclassifiable&#x27; work, several deceased poets appear as characters, their speech taken &quot;verbatim&quot; from their writings. A sequel, &quot;Last Night In England&quot;, is in process.

His first novel, &quot;Blue Burneau&quot; (1994), was shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Prize and the book &quot;Moon Country&quot;, published in 1996, describes a visit to Iceland with Simon Armitage. His second novel, &quot;The Girl Who Was Going To Die,&quot; was published in 2008 by Cape in the UK and by Kunstmann in Germany.

==Drama==

Plays include &quot;After Troy&quot; (dir. Alex Clifton), a retelling of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Women of Troy&quot; and &quot;Hecabe&quot; (Oxford Playhouse/Shaw Theatre London), &quot;Lily Jones&#x27;s Birthday&quot; a satyr-play based on Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, which premiered at RADA in 2009; &quot;Liberty&quot;, about the French Revolution, which premiered at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in the 2008 season (dir. Guy Retallack) and toured the UK. In New York, &quot;Agamemnon Home&quot; (dir. Amy Wagner) received its world premiere in April 2012.

Several of Maxwell&#x27;s plays and adaptations have been staged at Chester&#x27;s Grosvenor Park Open-Air Theatre, or in the city&#x27;s new Storyhouse Theatre, which opened in 2017 under the Artistic Directorship of Alex Clifton: these were &quot;Merlin and the Woods of Time&quot; (2011, dir. Alex Clifton), &quot;Masters Are You Mad?&quot; (2012, dir. Robin Norton-Hale), &quot;Cyrano De Bergerac&quot; (2013, dir. Lucy Pitman-Wallace), &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; (2015, dir. Alex Clifton), &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, a new version of the John Gay classic, (2017, dir. Alex Clifton), &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2017, dir. Derek Bond) and &quot;The Secret Seven&quot; (2017, dir. Alex Clifton). &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; and &quot;The Secret Seven&quot; were both nominated as &#x27;Best Play For Young People&#x27; at the British Theatre Awards. His eighth play for Chester, &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot;, played in autumn 2019 at Storyhouse.

His version of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; was also staged at Southwark Playhouse in 2016 (dir. Russell Bolam) starring Kathryn Hunter. Others recent plays include &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; (2017, dir. Bill Buckhurst), starring Sheila Atim, Diana Quick and Joseph Marcell.

&quot;The Lifeblood&quot;, concerning the last days of Mary, Queen of Scots, was British Theatre Guide&#x27;s &#x27;Play of the Fringe&#x27; at Edinburgh in 2004, and was directed by Guy Retallack with Sue Scott Davison as Mary. &quot;The Lifeblood&quot; was first performed at the Hen and Chickens Theatre in 2001 with Felicity Wren as Mary. His play &quot;Mimi and The Stalker&quot; was one of six projects awarded funding by the UK Film Council in the spring 2009 quarter, for development as a screenplay under the name &quot;Witchgrass.&quot;

Other plays include &quot;Wolfpit&quot;, about two green children said to have appeared in Suffolk in the 12th century (Edinburgh 1996; New York 2006), &quot;The Forever Waltz&quot;, a reworking of the Orpheus-Eurydice story (New York 2005; Edinburgh 2005), and &quot;The Only Girl in the World&quot;, a play about Mary Kelly, the last victim of Jack the Ripper (Hoxton Hall, 2001, Arcola, 2008).

He contributed the fantasy &quot;The Black Remote&quot; to the National Theatre&#x27;s Connections series in 2006.

He is the Resident Playwright for New York&#x27;s Phoenix Theatre Ensemble, who have staged &quot;Broken Journey&quot;, &quot;Wolfpit&quot;, &quot;The Lifeblood&quot; and &quot;Agamemnon Home&quot; in New York, and will present &quot;The Gambler&quot; (after Dostoevsky&#x27;s novella) in January 2016 at the Wild Project in the East Village.

His verse monologue, &quot;The Best Man&quot;, was turned into a feature film starring Danny Swanson (dir. Jon Croker).

Several of Maxwell&#x27;s plays and opera libretti are published by Oberon Books.

Maxwell directed his own play &quot;The City of Tomorrow&quot; at the Barn Theatre, Welwyn Garden City, in 2020, as part of the centenary celebrations of his home town.

<text>Teleoceras (Greek: &quot;perfect&quot; (teleos), &quot;horn&quot; (keratos)) is an extinct genus of rhinocerotid. It lived in North America during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs during the Hemingfordian to the end of Hemphillian from around 17.5 to 4.9 million years ago. It grew up to lengths of long.

&quot;Teleoceras&quot; went extinct in North America alongside &quot;Aphelops&quot; at the end of the Hemphillian, most likely due to rapid climate cooling, increased seasonality and expansion of C grasses, as isotopic evidence suggests that the uptake of C plants was far less than that in contemporary horses. The Gray Fossil Site in northeast Tennessee, dated to 4.5-5 million years ago, hosts one of the latest-known populations of &quot;Teleoceras,&quot; &quot;Teleoceras aepysoma.&quot;

== Description ==

&quot;Teleoceras&quot; had much shorter legs than modern rhinos, and a barrel chest, making its build more like that of a hippopotamus than a modern rhino. Based on this description, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested in 1898 that it was semi-aquatic and hippo-like in habits. This idea persisted for about a century, but has recently been discounted by isotopic evidence. 

Some species of &quot;Teleoceras&quot; have a small nasal horn, but this appears to be absent in other species such as &quot;T. aepysoma&quot;. &quot;Teleoceras&quot; has high crowned (hypsodont) molar teeth, which has historically led to suggestions that the species were grazers. Dental microwear and mesowear analysis alternatively suggest a browsing or mixed feeding (both browsing and grazing) diet. Carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of tooth enamel suggests hippo-like grazing habits, but not aquatic. However, δ18O measurements from Ashfall suggest that the species &quot;T. major&quot; was semi-aquatic.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
&quot;Teleoceras&quot; was sexually dimorphic. Males were larger, with larger tusks (lower incisors), a more massive head and neck, and significantly larger forelimbs. As a result of bimaturism, females matured and stopped growing before males, which is often seen in extant polygynous mammals. Males may have fought for mating rights; healed wounds on skulls have been observed, and healed broken ribs are not uncommon (although not all have their sexes determined). This is further supported by the breeding age female-to-male ratio in the Ashfall Fossil Beds being 4.25:1. There is also a rarity of young adult males preserved at Ashfall, which may be accounted for if they formed bachelor herds away from females and dominant bulls. 
== Discovery ==

=== Ashfall Fossil Beds ===
&quot;Teleoceras major&quot; is the most common fossil in the Ashfall Fossil Beds of Nebraska. Over 100 intact &quot;T. major&quot; skeletons are preserved in ash from the Bruneau-Jarbidge supervolcanic eruption. Of the 20+ taxa present, &quot;T. major&quot; was buried above the rest, being the last of the animals to succumb (small animals died faster), several weeks or months after the pyroclastic airfall event. Their skeletons show evidence of bone disease, ie hypertrophic pulmonary osteodystrophy (HPOD), as a result of lung failure from the fine volcanic ash.

Most of the skeletons are adult females and young, the breeding age female-to-male ratio being 4.25:1. There is also a rarity of young adult males. If the rhinos at Ashfall represent a herd, this may be accounted for if young adult males formed bachelor herds away from females and dominant bulls. The age demographic is very similar to that of modern hippo herds, as amongst the skeletons, 54% are immature, 30% are young adults, and 16% are older adults. 

The greatest concentration of Ashfall fossils is housed in a building called the &quot;Rhino Barn&quot;, due to the prevalence of &quot;T. major&quot; skeletons at the site, of which most were preserved in a nearly complete state. One extraordinary specimen includes the remains of a &quot;Teleoceras&quot; calf trying to suckle from its mother.

<doc id="854794" wikidata="Q783457" url="?curid=854794" title="Trento-class cruiser">
<text>The &quot;Trento&quot; class was a group of two heavy cruisers built for the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) in the late 1920s, the first such vessels built for the Italian fleet. The two ships in the class— and , were named after the redeemed cities of Trento and Trieste annexed from the Austro-Hungarian empire after the victory in World War I. The ships were very lightly armored, with only a thick armored belt, though they possessed a high speed and heavy main battery of eight guns. Nominally built under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, the two cruisers nevertheless exceeded the displacement limits imposed by the treaty.

In the interwar period, the two cruisers served in the Cruiser Division, frequently alternating as the divisional flagship. &quot;Trento&quot; made two extensive trips abroad, the first was a tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, &quot;Trieste&quot; assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. &quot;Trieste&quot; was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore missed the First and Second Battles of Sirte, where at the latter action &quot;Trento&quot; damaged a British destroyer.

&quot;Trento&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by a British torpedo bomber and a submarine in June 1942 with heavy loss of life. In April 1943, &quot;Trieste&quot; was also sunk in port at La Maddalena during an attack by United States heavy bombers. Salvage operations began in 1950, and after it was determined that the ship&#x27;s engines had been preserved by leaked fuel oil, the hull was sold to the Spanish Navy, which planned to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier. The plan was eventually cancelled in 1956 due to rising costs of the project, and &quot;Trieste&quot; was broken up for scrap in 1959.

== Design ==
In the early 1920s, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; began design studies for cruisers that would adhere to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruisers to a displacement of and an armament of guns. The design for what became the &quot;Trento&quot; class was prepared by General Filippo Bonfiglietti in 1923. In 1924, the French Navy laid down the first of two s, prompting the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; to order two vessels to match their rival. The designers emphasized very high speed, which required a significant reduction in armor protection to keep the ships within the displacement limit. In addition, they were designed with a narrow beam to help them reach high speeds, which reduced their stability. This would be the general pattern for Italian cruisers and destroyers built in the 1920s and 1930s, with the exception of the later s and some of the later s.

While the ships were still on the slipways, officers in the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; expressed concerns that the thin armor protection of the &quot;Trento&quot;s would leave the vessels poorly equipped for combat. As a result, the navy ordered the more balanced &quot;Zara&quot;-class, which featured a significantly thicker scale of armor protection. The lightly-built &quot;Trento&quot; design nevertheless provided the basis for the s built by Odero Terni Orlando for the Argentine Navy; the Argentine vessels were scaled down slightly, with thinner armor and guns. Another derivative design built for the Italian fleet, , started construction in 1930 and was commissioned in 1933; though the &quot;Bolzano&quot; was quite different from the other two vessels, she is sometimes considered a member of the &quot;Trento&quot; class.

===General characteristics===
The ships of the &quot;Trento&quot; class were long between perpendiculars and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . They had a design displacement of and they displaced up to at full load, though their displacement was nominally within the 10,000-long-ton restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty. Their hulls had a flush deck and a bulbous bow, the first time the latter feature was employed on an Italian warship. The ships were completed with a pair of tripod masts, though on trials they were found to vibrate excessively, and the foremast was strengthened with two extra legs. They had a crew of 723 officers and enlisted men, though during the war this increased to 781. They carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.

The &quot;Trento&quot;-class cruisers&#x27; power plant consisted of four Parsons steam turbines powered by twelve oil-fired Yarrow boilers, which were trunked into two funnels amidships. The boilers were divided into three boiler rooms with four each; two powered the forward engines that drove the outboard propellers and the remaining four were allocated to the turbines that drove the center shafts. The engines were rated at for a top speed of , with projected service performance of for at normal displacement. On sea trials, &quot;Trieste&quot; only reached and &quot;Trento&quot; managed slightly less than that; these speeds could only be reached on a very light displacement, and in service, her practical top speed was only . The ships had a storage capacity of of fuel oil, which provided a cruising range of at a speed of . During refits in early 1940, funnel caps were added to reduce smoke interference with the masts.

===Armament and armor===

&quot;Trento&quot; and &quot;Trieste&quot; were armed with a main battery of eight Mod 24 50-caliber guns in four gun turrets; each turret carried the guns in a single cradle rather than independent mounts. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft, and allowed for elevation to 45 degrees, for a maximum range of . They had a rate of fire of three rounds per minute, and the guns had to reset to 15 degrees to reload. The turrets were electrically operated, including the training and elevation gear and the ammunition hoists. The guns suffered from excessive shell dispersion, like many other Italian guns of the period. Initially supplied with shells fired at a muzzle velocity of , the shells and propellant charges were reduced—to at —in an unsuccessful attempt to tighten shell grouping. The problem was in large part due to poor quality control in Italian munition factories, which failed to ensure tight manufacturing tolerances necessary for accurate shells. In addition, the single cradle mounts required the guns to be very close together; this caused the shells to interfere with each other in flight and contributed to the dispersion problem. Fire control was provided by a pair of Barr &amp; Stroud coincidence rangefinders.

Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen  47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers-Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and four machine guns. The 100 mm guns were copies of Austro-Hungarian guns designed in 1910 by Škoda that were placed in newly designed dual-purpose mounts that elevated to 85 degrees for a maximum range of . In addition to the gun armament, they carried eight torpedo tubes in four deck mounted twin launchers. The ships&#x27; secondary batteries were revised several times during their careers. Both ships had their 100 mm guns replaced with newer Mod 31 versions of the same caliber. In 1937–1938, the two aft-most 100 mm guns were removed, along with all four 12.7 mm machine guns; eight 54-cal. Breda M1932 guns and eight Breda M1931 machine guns, all in twin mounts, were installed in their place. In 1942, &quot;Trento&quot; received four 65-cal. Breda M1940 guns in single mounts, with &quot;Trieste&quot; receiving eight of those guns the following year.

Both vessels were protected with an armored citadel that covered the ships&#x27; vitals, including the machinery spaces and ammunition magazines. The vertical armor belt was thick and ran from forward of the fore main battery turrets to aft of the rear turrets. Either end of the belt was capped with armored bulkheads thick on the upper portion; the forward bulkhead had a lower section that was reduced to , and the aft bulkhead&#x27;s lower portion was reduced to . Their armor deck was 50 mm thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to aft, with thick sloped sides. The armor deck did not extend forward of the citadel. The gun turrets had thick plating on the faces and the supporting barbettes they sat in were 70 mm thick above the armor deck and 60 mm thick below. The main conning tower had 100 mm thick sides and a 50 mm thick roof; above the tower was a fire control director with thick sides and a 60 mm thick roof.

==Service history==
&quot;Trento&quot; and &quot;Trieste&quot; were named for the two largest unredeemed cities taken from Austria-Hungary in the aftermath of World War I. They frequently served as the flagship of the Cruiser Division throughout the 1930s. During the pre-war period, &quot;Trento&quot; made lengthy trips abroad, including a tour of South America from May to October 1929 and a deployment to China from January to June 1932 to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. Both vessels took part in numerous naval reviews held for visiting foreign leaders in the 1930s, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. In 1938 &quot;Trieste&quot; helped transport soldiers of the &quot;Corpo Truppe Volontarie&quot; (Corps of Volunteer Troops), which had been sent to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War, back to Italy.

After Italy entered World War II in June 1940, &quot;Trento&quot; and &quot;Trieste&quot; saw extensive action against British forces in the Mediterranean Sea, including at the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan in July and November 1940 and March 1941, respectively. &quot;Trento&quot; was present at Calabria, where she battled British cruisers but did not sustain any damage. At the Battle of Cape Spartivento, either &quot;Trento&quot; or &quot;Trieste&quot; scored a hit on the British cruiser , and &quot;Trieste&quot; was briefly engaged but not seriously damaged by the battlecruiser . At Cape Matapan, the two cruisers engaged several British cruisers at very long range, with neither side scoring any hits.

In November 1941, &quot;Trieste&quot; was torpedoed by the submarine ; she spent most of the next year under repair. In the meantime, &quot;Trento&quot; was also present during the inconclusive First and Second Battles of Sirte, and at the latter she severely damaged a British destroyer. Both cruisers were also frequently tasked with escorting convoys to supply Italian forces in North Africa as well as interdicting British convoys to the island of Malta in the central Mediterranean. During one of the latter missions to attack the British Operation Harpoon convoy in June 1942, &quot;Trento&quot; was torpedoed twice, first by a Bristol Beaufighter torpedo bomber and then sunk by the submarine with very heavy loss of life on 15 June; out of a wartime complement of 51 officers and 1,100 enlisted men, 549 were killed in the sinking, and a further 21 later died of wounds.

&quot;Trieste&quot; returned to action in August 1942 for an operation that was cancelled following the torpedoing of another Italian cruiser by a British submarine. &quot;Trieste&quot; was moved to La Maddalena, Sardinia, where she was later sunk by United States heavy bombers on 10 April 1943. Salvage work on &quot;Trieste&quot; began in 1950. Her superstructure was cut away and she was refloated and towed to La Spezia; an inspection revealed that fuel oil had leaked into the machinery spaces, protecting them while the ship had been submerged. The Spanish Navy purchased the hull in 1952 and had her towed to Ferrol, with plans to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier. The project ultimately came to nothing due to the growing costs of the project, forcing its cancellation in 1956. She was ultimately broken up by 1959.

<text>Jeremiah Joyce (1763–1816) was an English Unitarian minister and writer. He achieved notoriety as one of the group of political activists arrested in May 1794.

==Early life==
He was born 24 February 1763, the son of Jeremiah Joyce (1718–1788), a master woolcomber at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and his wife Hannah Somersett (1726–1818); his place of birth was Cheshunt, or Mildred&#x27;s Court, Poultry, London, Hannah&#x27;s family home. He attended the nonconformist school in Cheshunt run by the Rev. Samuel Worsley, who had attended Daventry Academy.

In 1777 Joyce was apprenticed to a glazier, John Willis, of Strand, London. Willis was a member of the Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Painters of Glass, and founded a building company, later Sykes &amp; Son, that still exists (as of 2022). He did work on St Clement Danes church and the Middle Temple; and in 1778 took on his own son John as apprentice. After seven years, Joyce completed the apprenticeship, going to business on his own account as a journeyman.

Joyce worked in Essex Street, London. His associations were based on rational dissent and the Bowood circle. He knew nonconformist ministers, and publishers. Before the death of his father, and with the support of his brother, Joshua, and Hugh Worthington, he studied for the Unitarian ministry at New College, Hackney. He was one of its first intake of students in 1786, with Joseph Lomas Towers, son of Joseph Towers. He became proficient in mathematics and Latin.

==Stanhope household and activism==
In 1790 Joyce was appointed to Lord Mahon, eldest son of Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope. His duties in the household extended to the younger children, and he acted as secretary to Stanhope.

Stanhope and Joyce shared radical political views: Stanhope by the end of 1789 was chairing the London Revolution Society, named for the centennial of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and took the French Revolution to heart. As well as hiring Joyce, he dismissed his governesses, and required his daughter Hester Stanhope, age 14, to mind turkeys on a village green.

Joyce became a member of the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI) and of the London Corresponding Society (LCS) founded in early 1792. At SCI meetings he encountered John Augustus Bonney who was Tom Paine&#x27;s lawyer; John Cartwright; Thomas Holcroft; Stewart Kyd; and others including a Mr Banks tentatively identified as Thomas Banks. He was involved in the distribution of Paine&#x27;s works, to Samuel Fox at Derby and via Stanhope&#x27;s residence.

By 1791, Joyce had joined the Unitarian Society (fuller name Unitarian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue, to which was added &quot;by the distribution of books&quot;). In the following years he was involved in publications, and the Society had as associate Joseph Johnson. He joined the Essex Street Chapel congregation, and formed a long-standing relationship with Theophilus Lindsey, its founder. When Lindsey retired from the chapel in 1793, Joyce for a period was minister there with John Disney, who had shared the position with Lindsey from 1783. Joyce took the afternoon services, continuing until 1804 when Thomas Belsham took over the chapel.

Ahead of the penal transportation of the Scottish Martyrs to Liberty and Maurice Margarot of the LCS, Joyce on 28 March 1794 proposed an address of support from the SCI. It contained the sentiment &quot;A full and fair Representation of the People of Great Britain we seek, with all the ardour of men and Britons&quot;. From 4 April the SCI and LCS worked together, to nominate delegates to a convention of the &quot;Friends of Liberty&quot;. Joyce was chosen, with Holcroft, Kyd, William Sharp and Thomas Wardle.

==Treason charge and acquittal==
A dozen activists were arrested in May, followed by the passing of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1794, and Joyce was one of those picked up. On 12 May Thomas Hardy of the LCS was taken into custody at home by Bow Street Runners and King&#x27;s Messengers. Shortly after that an ambiguous letter from Joyce to John Horne Tooke of the SCI, written within hours of Hardy&#x27;s arrest. was intercepted by the authorities. John Thelwall was arrested on 13 May, at Beaufort Buildings, Strand, London where he was lecturing. Horne Tooke himself was arrested on 16 May. Others detained in the sweep included the silversmith John Baxter, successor to Margarot at the LCS; the businessman John Richter, LCS and an SCI associate; and Bonney and Kyd of the LCI.
On 14 May 1794 Joyce was at Stanhope&#x27;s house Chevening in Kent, and was arrested while talking to Stanhope&#x27;s sons, by John King and a King&#x27;s Messenger. The charge was &quot;treasonable practices&quot;. The arrest occurred at around 8 am. Joyce was being examined by the Privy Council by about 1 pm that day. He refused to answer any questions without a lawyer, which he was not allowed.

Joyce remained in custody until 19 May when, with others, he was committed to the Tower of London on a charge of high treason. While he was there, he was visited by his friend William Shepherd. Two treason trials took place in Edinburgh, in August and September. In September a grand jury of Middlesex concluded that there was evidence for treason charges against 12 men. Seven of the detained group were moved from the Tower to Newgate Gaol on 24 October. They were arraigned at the Old Bailey on 25 October. The judges involved were James Eyre, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Archibald Macdonald, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, both of whom had been present at the Privy Council hearings.

After the acquittal of his co-defendants Hardy and Horne Tooke, charges against Joyce were dropped. He had suffered 23 weeks imprisonment. While Joyce was confined, supporters printed a book under his name. It was a sermon from earlier in the year, but contained also an appendix consisting of his examination by the Privy Council, and that of Bonney who was released at the same time. After his release it was being distributed by Arthur Aikin. His own work on the legal process, &quot;An Account of Mr. Joyce&#x27;s Arrest for &quot;treasonable Practices&quot;. His Examination ... With Remarks on the Speeches of Mr. Windham, &amp;c.&quot;, appeared in 1795.

==Later life==
Joyce was released on 1 December 1794, and was welcomed back to Chevening, the village being lit up; if not by the rector, the Rev. Samuel Preston, chaplain to John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham who was Lord Privy Seal. He was quick to pay a visit to William Shepherd at Gatacre.

Stanhope built Joyce a house in the grounds at Chevening. Joyce lived there for about four years, joined by his wife Elizabeth in 1796. He moved away in 1799. The troubled Stanhope household, where the father&#x27;s insistence on home education was contentious, started to break up over the period. Daughter Lady Hester in the end moved out to live at Walmer with her uncle William Pitt the Younger, the Prime Minister, in 1803 according to John Ehrman; where he reportedly told her Tom Paine was &quot;quite in the right&quot; but he couldn&#x27;t risk revolution.

At this period, Theophilus Lindsey had hopes to find Joyce a full place as Unitarian minister; but he found that impossible, as he explained to John Rowe (1764–1832). In fact, while Joyce had been a popular preacher with some Unitarian congregations after his release, he had become somewhat of an embarrassment. Rowe&#x27;s congregation at Shrewsbury would not accept him in 1799. In 1801, Joyce was linked to William Winterbotham in a pamphlet by &quot;The Enquirer&quot; (William Atkinson). In later life he lived in Holly Terrace, Highgate, and succeeded Rochemont Barbauld as minister of a small Unitarian congregation at Rosslyn Hill.

In 1799 Joyce took up a position as tutor to the sons of Benjamin Travers the elder (1752–1818), treasurer to the Gravel Pit Chapel and father of Benjamin Travers, a grocer in the sugar trade. He was in business with William Smith, who was an SCI member. The firm, later known as Joseph Travers &amp; Sons, was then trading as Smith, Travers &amp; Kemble.

For many years, Joyce was the secretary of the Unitarian Society. At the end of Lindsey&#x27;s life, Joyce was close to him. When Lindsey died in 1808, Joyce wrote an anonymous obituary, the &quot;Brief account&quot; in &quot;The Monthly Magazine&quot;; and took the lead from William Frend&#x27;s obituary, which concentrated on Lindsey&#x27;s religious involvement, to burn much of Lindsey&#x27;s political correspondence, particular that dealing with the American revolution.

==Works==
Joyce wrote a number of popular educational works on science and mathematics. He also contributed articles to &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; (1802–1819).

===As editor===
*&quot;A Narrative of the Sufferings of T. F. Palmer and W. Skirving, During a Voyage to New South Wales, 1794, on Board the Surprize Transport&quot;. Joyce prepared this work on the Scottish Martyrs from a manuscript by Thomas Fyshe Palmer brought from New South Wales by John White. Muir, Palmer and Skirving had serious criticisms of Capt. Patrick Campbell of the &quot;Surprize&quot;, but also of Margarot, included by Joyce in his introduction.

Joyce was largely responsible for the editing of two rival encyclopedic works bearing the names of others, George Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot; (from 1803) and as managing editor of William Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot; (1809). These works shared a substantial portion of their texts.

===Instructional===
*&quot;Scientific Dialogues&quot; (1800, 2 vols.) Later editions, from 1807, in 7 vols.
*&quot;System of Practical Arithmetic&quot; (1808)
*&quot;A Familiar Introduction to the Arts and Sciences for the Use of Schools and Young Persons&quot; (1810)

&quot;Systematic Education&quot; (1816) was a collaboration with Lant Carpenter and William Shepherd.

==Family==
Joyce married in 1796 Elizabeth Harding, niece of Captain George Fagg (Slouney), who as a privateer of the Anglo-French War (1778–1783) ran the blockade of Gibraltar in 1780, commanding the &quot;Buck&quot; of Folkestone. The youngest of his six children, Hannah, born the year before Joyce&#x27;s death, was fostered by his friend William Shepherd. She later married William Ridyard.

<doc id="854797" wikidata="Q4798197" url="?curid=854797" title="Arthur Caplan">
<text>Arthur L. Caplan (born 1950) is an American ethicist and professor of bioethics at New York University Grossman School of Medicine.

He is known for his contributions to the U.S. public policy, including: helping to found the National Marrow Donor Program; creating the policy of required request in cadaver organ donation adopted throughout the United States; helping to create the system for distributing organs in the U.S.; and advising on the content of the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, rules governing living organ donation, and legislation and regulation in many other areas of health care including blood safety and compassionate use.

==Early life and education==
Born in Boston in 1950 to Sidney D. and Natalie Caplan, Arthur Caplan grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts. He has described his family as &quot;Workmen&#x27;s Circle, Zionist, and secular.&quot; He credits his Jewish background with stimulating his interest in methods of inquiry and argument. At age six, Caplan was diagnosed with polio. He was successfully treated at Children&#x27;s Hospital in Boston and went on to play sports at Framingham North High School. Caplan has stated that this life-threatening illness was a formative experience that influenced his later commitment to philosophy and bioethics.

Caplan did his undergraduate work at Brandeis University, where he majored in philosophy. There he met his future wife Jane. Their son, Zachary, was born in 1984. Caplan&#x27;s second wife, Meg O’Shea Caplan, is the medical center director of the Bronx VA Medical Center.

Caplan did his graduate work at Columbia University, receiving an M.A. in 1973, an M.Phil. in 1975, and a Ph.D. in the history and philosophy of science in 1979. His dissertation, &quot;Philosophical Issues Concerning the Synthetic Theory of Evolution&quot;, was co-supervised by Ernest Nagel and Sidney Morgenbesser. Caplan worked with Nagel as a teaching assistant and was the final graduate student of Nagel&#x27;s career. During his time at Columbia, Caplan met psychoanalyst and Dean of Education Bernard Schoenberg. Schoenberg allowed him to participate as both an observer and a medical student in clinical rotations in the university&#x27;s medical college, first experiencing &quot;ethics in action&quot;.

==Career==
In 1977, Caplan met Daniel Callahan, a philosopher who co-founded The Hastings Center (now in Garrison, New York) with psychiatrist Willard Gaylin. In 1977, Caplan joined The Hastings Center, first as a junior research assistant and then as a post-doctoral fellow. He spent the next 10 years at the center, serving as the associate director from 1985 to 1987. During this time, Caplan published many papers on genetics (including the ethics of genetic testing and screening), evolution, sociobiology, and the teaching of ethics. He also became involved in the ethics of human and animal experimentation and new medical technologies, applying philosophy in public discourse and speaking on public policy issues.

In 1987, Caplan moved to the University of Minnesota, where he became a professor in the Departments of Philosophy and Surgery and the first director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics. In 1989, he organized the Center for Bioethics Conference on Medical Ethics and the Holocaust, the first conference convened to discuss bioethics and the Holocaust. During his time at Minnesota he was active on issues relating to organ transplantation and genetics and worked with Rosalie A. Kane on dilemmas of &quot;everyday ethics&quot; involving treatment of the elderly. He also wrote about bioethics in relation to the Holocaust. In 1992, he joined the Medical Advisory Council of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

Caplan secured the first apology for the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, from Lewis Sullivan, M.D., then secretary of HHS, in 1991. He worked with William Seidelman, M.D., and others to secure in 2012 an apology from the German Medical Association for the role of German physicians in Nazi prison experiments during the Holocaust.
In May 1994, Caplan went to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He founded the Center for Bioethics and the Department of Medical Ethics and had professorial appointments in a variety of departments including Medicine and Philosophy. In the mid-1990s, he and colleagues conducted the first empirical studies on organ donor eligibility and donation rates. In 2009, the Sidney D. Caplan Professor of Bioethics was established at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Perelman School of Medicine, named for Caplan&#x27;s father. Arthur Caplan became the first holder of the professorship.

While at the University of Pennsylvania, he became the first bioethicist to be sued for his professional role, after his involvement in a gene therapy trial that resulted in the death of research subject Jesse Gelsinger. The family&#x27;s suit was settled with the University for an undisclosed amount of money, in exchange for, among other things, dropping Caplan from the suit. The federal government&#x27;s suit on the same facts was settled for $500,000.

In 2009, Caplan helped develop the first flu vaccine mandate at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia and, later, New York state&#x27;s policy to require health care workers to &quot;vaccinate or mask&quot;. Also in 2009, he called for tightening restrictions on fertility clinics and IVF and has written extensively in favor of embryonic stem cell research.

In 2012, Caplan came to New York University&#x27;s School of Medicine as the Drs. William F. and Virginia Connolly Mitty Professor of Bioethics and the founding director of the Division of Bioethics.

In May 2015, Caplan launched, with pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson, a pilot project for the equitable distribution of experimental drugs outside ongoing clinical trials. He created the Compassionate Use Advisory Committee (CompAC), a panel of bioethicists, physicians, and patient advocates, to respond to appeals from terminally ill patients for a cancer drug in development by J&amp;J. It is believed to be the first of its kind in the pharmaceuticals industry.

Recent activity has included spearheading a movement to relax restrictions on blood donations by gay men and urging postponement of the Rio Summer Olympics because of the Zika virus threat. In early May 2020, the United States Conference of Mayors announced the Mayors Advisory Panel on Sports, Recreation &amp; Health, with Caplan as a co-chair, to &quot;advise mayors and sports and recreation officials on safe policies and practices as cities reopen from the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;, and in November 2020 he joined the NCAA COVID-19 Medical Advisory Group. MarketWatch featured Caplan in an article on the life of a bioethicist during the COVID-19 pandemic on August 4, 2020.

Much of his time from 2020 to present has been focused on the COVID-19 pandemic. He has spoken and written extensively on vaccine-related topics, including the ethics of placebo-controlled trials during the pandemic, what is owed to vaccine trial participants after a vaccine has been authorized, COVID-19 vaccination of transplant candidates, and more specialized topics such understanding attitudes toward the disease and vaccines among a Haredi-Orthodox Jewish community. He was one of the more vocal proponents of controversial challenge studies for SARS-CoV2 vaccines.

Caplan has been criticized by some classical philosophers for his &quot;hands-on philosophy&quot;, and by some colleagues for his enthusiastic engagement with the media. In response, he said: &quot;To me, the whole point of doing ethics is to change people, to change behavior. Why else do it?&quot;

In 2021, Caplan published a commentary on a medical news website titled &quot;It’s Okay for Docs to Refuse to Treat Unvaccinated Patients&quot;. This position was criticized by Lainie Friedman Ross in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases. In a CNN interview, Caplan said of the unvaccinated: &quot;I&#x27;ll condemn them. I&#x27;ll shame them. [...] We can penalize them more. We can say, you&#x27;re going to pay more on your hospital bill if you aren&#x27;t vaccinated. You can&#x27;t get life insurance or disability insurance at affordable rates if you aren&#x27;t vaccinated.&quot; Caplan supported the removal of an unvaccinated patient who was near death from a hospital&#x27;s transplant waitlist.

In 2022, Caplan advocated that pharmaceutical companies should stop doing business in Russia, an action that was criticized as advocating for a war crime.

==Academic work==
Caplan is the author and editor of more than 35 books and more than 860 papers in peer-reviewed journals of medicine, science, philosophy, bioethics, and health policy.

He is a regular contributor to WebMD&#x27;s Medscape and a regular commentator on CNN, WOR Radio, WGBH (FM)&#x27;s &quot;Boston Public Radio&quot; and WMNF Tampa&#x27;s &quot;Everyday Ethics&quot; podcast. He is a frequent guest and commentator on various other media outlets, discussing public health issues like obesity, Ebola virus disease, Zika virus, vaccination, and COVID-19.

He has been co-director of the Joint Council of Europe/United Nations Study on Trafficking in Organs and Body Parts. He was the co-director of a United Nations/Council of Europe Study on organ trafficking. He has called for a new international convention on criminal organ trafficking. He has spoken out on international issues such as organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China. He instituted a boycott by leading medical journals of papers about transplantation coming from China.

Internationally, he was the chair of the Advisory Committee to the United Nations on Human Cloning, and served on the special advisory committee to the International Olympic Committee on genetics and gene therapy.

Caplan has served on a number of national committees, including as chair of the National Cancer Institute Biobanking Ethics Working Group and chair of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Health and Human Services on Blood Safety and Availability. He was a member of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses and the special advisory panel to the National Institute of Mental Health on human experimentation on vulnerable subjects. He is an adviser to DARPA on synthetic biology and has addressed the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. He has also served on the ethics committee of the American Society of Gene Therapy.

Caplan has consulted with many corporations, not-for-profit organizations, and consumer organizations. He is on the board of trustees of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies.
He also sat on the board of the National Center for Policy Research on Women &amp; Families, the Franklin Institute, the Iron Disorders Foundation, and the National Disease Research Interchange. 

==Awards and honors==
Caplan has been elected as a fellow of The Hastings Center (1990), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1994), the College of Physicians of Philadelphia (1994), the New York Academy of Medicine (1997), and an honorary fellow of the American College of Legal Medicine (2008).

Caplan was named a person of the Year in 2001 by &quot;USA Today&quot;. In December 2008, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine named him one of the 10 most influential people in science, for ”translating philosophical debates into understandable ideas” and “democratizing bioethics.” He is one of the 10 most influential people in America in biotechnology, according to the &quot;National Journal&quot;; one of the 10 most influential people in the ethics of biotechnology, according to &quot;Nature Biotechnology&quot;; one of the 50 most influential people in American health care, according to &quot;Modern Health Care&quot; magazine; and one of the 100 most influential people in biotechnology, according to &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine.

Caplan holds eight honorary degrees from colleges and medical schools. He received the McGovern Medal of the American Medical Writers Association in 1999, the John P. McGovern Award Lectureship from the Medical Library Association in 2007, and the Patricia Price Browne Prize in Biomedical Ethics in 2011.

In 2014, he was given the public service award of the National Science Board/National Science Foundation. In May 2016, he received the Rare Impact Award from the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD). The American Society for Bioethics &amp; Humanities (ASBH) awarded Caplan its 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2018 the Food and Drug Law Institute honored him with a Distinguished Service and Leadership Award.

<text>The Chiesa di Santa Margherita de&#x27; Cerchi is a 13th-century, Roman Catholic church dedicated to Margaret the Virgin in the centre of Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. It is among the oldest churches in Florence.

==History==
It is first recorded in 1032 and is said, contentiously, to have been the location of Dante&#x27;s marriage to Gemma Donati in 1285 or 1290. It was certainly the Donati family&#x27;s parish church and also contains several tombs of the Portinari family, to which Dante&#x27;s great love Beatrice Portinari belonged, including Monna Tessa, her nursemaid.

The church was consecrated on the day of &quot;Saint Margaret&quot;. The main patron families of the church in the 13th and 14th century, who had chapels in the church, were the Cerchi, the Donati, and the Adimari families.

The church contains a fine altarpiece of the &quot;Madonna and Four Saints&quot; by Neri di Bicci. In the entrance is a chapel erected by Jacopo Salviati and his wife, Lucrezia de&#x27; Medici.

Tradition holds that visitors can plead in writing to Beatrice to ask her to fix their love lives, leaving the letters in a basket next to her shrine.

<text>Hwang Young-cho (; born 22 March 1970) is a former South Korean athlete, winner of the marathon race at the 1992 Summer Olympics and 1994 Asian Games.

==Career==

Born in Samcheok, South Korea, Hwang was a promising track athlete in his junior years, but after his first marathon in 1991, which he won, he decided to specialize in marathon.

The Barcelona Olympic marathon was only the fourth of his career. He had won two and placed second in his three previous marathons. In Barcelona, Hwang was in the leading pack from the start, but in a slow race, this group still numbered thirty runners at the halfway mark. However, athletes gradually fell off the pace as the second half of the race went on, until at 35 km, only Hwang and Kōichi Morishita from Japan remained. They had quite a memorable struggle, until Hwang broke away at the 40 km mark to win the gold medal.

Hwang raced sparingly after Barcelona, and he retired after injury prevented him from representing South Korea in the 1996 Olympics.

Hwang was depicted on the 2006 Berlin Marathon medal to commemorate his victory in the 1992 Olympic marathon event.

==South Koreans&#x27; Olympic marathon medals==
Hwang is one of two Koreans to have won the Olympic marathon. The other winner was Sohn Kee-chung. Hwang&#x27;s contemporary, Lee Bong-Ju won the silver medal in the marathon at the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, and Nam Sung-yong won the bronze medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin at the same race that Sohn Kee-chung won.

<doc id="854803" wikidata="Q5684233" url="?curid=854803" title="Hawaii Admission Act">
<text>The Admission Act, formally An Act to Provide for the Admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union () is a statute enacted by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower which dissolved the Territory of Hawaii and established the State of Hawaii as the 50th state to be admitted into the Union. Statehood became effective on August 21, 1959. Hawaii remains the most recent state to join the United States.

==Hawaii statehood and international law==
Prior to 1959, Hawaii was an organized incorporated territory of the United States. The territory was established in 1900 by the Hawaiian Organic Act. In 1946, the United Nations listed Hawaii as a non-self-governing territory under the administration of the United States (Resolution 55(I) of 1946-12-14). Also listed as non-self-governing territories under the jurisdiction of the United States were American Samoa, Guam, the Panama Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, the Territory of Alaska, and the United States Virgin Islands.

==Statehood vote==

Out of a total population of 600,000 in the islands and 155,000 registered voters, 140,000 votes were cast, the highest turnout ever in Hawaii. The vote showed approval rates of at least 93% by voters on all major islands. Of the approximately 140,000 votes cast, fewer than 8,000 rejected the Admission Act of 1959.

===Opposition to statehood===
The acceptance of statehood for Hawaii was not without its share of controversy. There were Native Hawaiians who protested against statehood. Prior to admission, various bills creating the state were stalled in congressional hearings since the early 1900s. There was a fear of establishing a state with an Asian American plurality. Some lawmakers worried about the addition of Hawaii&#x27;s residents to the United States, in light of protests and possibly split loyalties.

Upon the election of John A. Burns from the Hawaii Democratic Party as delegate of the Territory of Hawaii to Congress, southern leaders charged that Burns&#x27; election was evidence of Hawaii as a haven for communism. Burns, in 1959, would reflect on the obstacles against the statehood campaign and place more emphasis on the resistance to statehood in the islands, rather than in Washington itself.
The reasons why Hawaii did not achieve statehood, say, ten years ago—and one could without much exaggeration say sixty years ago—lie not in the Congress but in Hawaii. The most effective opposition to statehood has always originated in Hawaii itself. For the most part it has remained under cover and has marched under other banners. Such opposition could not afford to disclose itself, since it was so decidedly against the interests and desires of Hawaii&#x27;s people generally.
===Southern lawmakers===
Burns was involved in vigorous lobbying of his colleagues persuading them that the race-based objections were unfair and charges that Communist sympathizers controlled Hawaii were false. Minutes from Johnson&#x27;s tenure as head of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee indicate he conceded on the issue to the segregationist Senator Richard Russell.

===Alice Kamokila Campbell===
On the 53rd anniversary of the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, January 17, 1946, Territorial Senator Alice Kamokila Campbell, one of the few voices that opposed statehood for Hawaii, offered her testimony to the joint congressional committee sent to investigate and report on statehood. Kamokila Campbell testified at Iolani Palace in front of a small crowd of 600 to frequent applause. There she stated.
I do not feel...we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in Congress, that we, the lovers of Hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores, that we should satisfy the thirst for power and control of some inflated industrialists and politicians who hide under the guise of friends of Hawaii, yet still keeping an eagle eye on the financial and political pressure button of subjugation over the people in general of these islands.
In 1947, Kamokila Campbell opened the Anti-Statehood Clearing House, where she sent &quot;anti-statehood information, reports and arguments to congress.&quot;

On March 29, 1949, Kamokila Campbell successfully sued the Hawaii Statehood Commission, to stop them from spending public money to lobby for statehood, invalidating a single section of the Act which created the Hawaii Statehood Commission.

==Formation of the state==
The State of Hawaii&#x27;s territory was defined thus in the Act:

<doc id="854811" wikidata="Q3621549" url="?curid=854811" title="Écriture féminine">
<text>Écriture féminine, or &quot;women&#x27;s writing&quot;, is a term coined by French feminist and literary theorist Hélène Cixous in her 1975 essay &quot;The Laugh of the Medusa&quot;. Cixous aimed to establish a genre of literary writing that deviates from traditional masculine styles of writing, one which examines the relationship between the cultural and psychological inscription of the female body and female difference in language and text. This strand of feminist literary theory originated in France in the early 1970s through the works of Cixous and other theorists including Luce Irigaray, Chantal Chawaf, Catherine Clément and Julia Kristeva, and has subsequently been expanded upon by writers such as psychoanalytic theorist Bracha Ettinger. who emerged in this field in the early 1990s,

&quot;Écriture féminine&quot; as a theory foregrounds the importance of language for the psychic understanding of self. Cixous is searching for what Isidore Isou refers to as the &quot;hidden signifer&quot; in language which expresses the ineffable and what cannot be expressed in structuralist language. It has been suggested by Cixous herself that more free and flowing styles of writing such as stream of consciousness, have a more &quot;feminine&quot; structure and tone than that of more traditional modes of writing. This theory draws on ground theory work in psychoanalysis about the way that humans come to understand their social roles. In doing so, it goes on to expound how women, who may be positioned as &#x27;other&#x27; in a masculine symbolic order, can reaffirm their understanding of the world through engaging with their own otherness, both within and outside their own minds, or consciousness.

==Cixous==

Hélène Cixous first coined &quot;écriture féminine&quot; in her essay &quot;The Laugh of the Medusa&quot; (1975), where she asserts &quot;woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies&quot; because their sexual pleasure has been repressed and denied expression. Inspired by Cixous&#x27; essay, a recent book titled &quot;Laughing with Medusa&quot; (2006) analyzes the collective work of Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bracha Ettinger and Hélène Cixous. These writers are as a whole referred to by Anglophones as &quot;the French feminists,&quot; though Mary Klages, Associate Professor in the English Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has pointed out that &quot;poststructuralist theoretical feminists&quot; would be a more accurate term. Madeleine Gagnon is a more recent proponent. And since the aforementioned 1975 when Cixous also founded women&#x27;s studies at Vincennes, she has been as a spokeswoman for the group &quot;Psychanalyse et politique&quot; and a prolific writer of texts for their publishing house, &quot;des femmes&quot;. And when asked of her own writing she says, &quot;Je suis là où ça parle&quot; (&quot;I am there where it/id/the female unconscious speaks.&quot;)

American feminist critic and writer Elaine Showalter defines this movement as &quot;the inscription of the feminine body and female difference in language and text.&quot; &quot;Écriture féminine&quot; places experience before language, and privileges non-linear, cyclical writing that evades &quot;the discourse that regulates the phallocentric system.&quot; Because language is not a neutral medium, it can be said to function as an instrument of patriarchal expression. As Peter Barry writes, &quot;the female writer is seen as suffering the handicap of having to use a medium (prose writing) which is essentially a male instrument fashioned for male purposes&quot;. &quot;Ecriture féminine&quot; thus exists as an antithesis of masculine writing or as a means of escape for women.

In the words of Rosemarie Tong, &quot;Cixous challenged women to write themselves out of the world men constructed for women. She urged women to put themselves-the unthinkable/unthought-into words.&quot;
Almost everything is yet to be written by women about femininity: about their sexuality, that is, its infinite and mobile complexity; about their eroticization, sudden turn-ons of a certain minuscule-immense area of their bodies; not about destiny, but about the adventure of such and such a drive, about trips, crossings, trudges, abrupt and gradual awakenings, discoveries of a zone at once timorous and soon to be forthright. 
With regard to phallogocentric writing, Tong argues that &quot;male sexuality, which centers on what Cixous called the &quot;big dick&quot;, is ultimately boring in its pointedness and singularity. Like male sexuality, masculine writing, which Cixous usually termed phallogocentric writing, is also ultimately boring&quot; and furthermore, that &quot;stamped with the official seal of social approval, masculine writing is too weighted down to move or change&quot;.
Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which the publishing houses are the crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that works against us and off our backs; not &quot;yourself&quot;. Smug-faced readers, managing editors, and big bosses don&#x27;t like the true texts of women- female-sexed texts. That kind scares them.
For Cixous, &quot;écriture féminine&quot; is not only a possibility for female writers; rather, she believes it can be (and has been) employed by male authors such as James Joyce or Jean Genet. Some have found this idea difficult to reconcile with Cixous&#x27; definition of &quot;écriture féminine&quot; (often termed &#x27;white ink&#x27;) because of the many references she makes to the female body (&quot;There is always in her at least a little of that good mother&#x27;s milk. She writes in white ink&quot;.) when characterizing the essence of écriture féminine and explaining its origin. This notion raises problems for some theorists:
&quot;&quot;Ecriture féminine&quot;, then, is by its nature transgressive, rule-transcending, intoxicated, but it is clear that the notion as put forward by Cixous raises many problems. The realm of the body, for instance, is seen as somehow immune to social and gender condition and able to issue forth a pure essence of the feminine. Such essentialism is difficult to square with feminism which emphasizes femininity as a social construction...&quot;
==Irigaray and Kristeva==

For Luce Irigaray, women&#x27;s sexual pleasure &quot;jouissance&quot; cannot be expressed by the dominant, ordered, &quot;logical,&quot; masculine language because, according to Kristeva, feminine language is derived from the pre-oedipal period of fusion between mother and child which she termed the semiotic. Associated with the maternal, feminine language (which Irigaray called &quot;parler femme&quot;, womanspeak) is not only a threat to culture, which is patriarchal, but also a medium through which women may be creative in new ways. Irigaray expressed this connection between women&#x27;s sexuality and women&#x27;s language through the following analogy: women&#x27;s &quot;jouissance&quot; is more multiple than men&#x27;s unitary, phallic pleasure because 
&quot;woman has sex organs just about everywhere...feminine language is more diffusive than its &#x27;masculine counterpart&#x27;. That is undoubtedly the reason...her language...goes off in all directions and...he is unable to discern the coherence.&quot; 
Irigaray and Cixous also go on to emphasize that women, historically limited to being sexual objects for men (virgins or prostitutes, wives or mothers), have been prevented from expressing their sexuality in itself or for themselves. If they can do this, and if they can speak about it in the new languages it calls for, they will establish a point of view (a site of difference) from which phallogocentric concepts and controls can be seen through and taken apart, not only in theory, but also in practice.

==Ettinger==

Bracha L. Ettinger invented a field of notions and concepts to address and become aware of affects, feeling and trans-subjective connectivity that originates in the subject and humanizes her and him, according to Ettinger, via the feminine sexuality, pre-maternal experiences and maternal potentiality. Ettinger&#x27;s language, developed slowly from 1985 and until now in poetic writing in artist&#x27;s books and in academic writing, includes her original concepts like: matrixial time-space, matrixial space, metramorphosis, com-passion, coemergence, cofading, copoiesis, wit(h)nessing, fascinance, carriance, psychic pregnance, distance-in-proximity, borderlnking, borderspacing, proximity-in-distance, matrixial feminine/prenatal Encounter-event and ethical seduction-into-life. Many writers in the fields of film theory, psychoanalysis, ethics, aesthetics, Literature studies, Contemporary art and Art History are using the Ettingerian matrixial sphere (matricial sphere) in their analysis of contemporary and historical material.

==Critiques==

The approach through language to feminist action has been criticised by some as over-theoretical: they would see the fact that the very first meeting of a handful of would-be feminist activists in 1970 only managed to launch an acrimonious theoretical debate as marking the situation as typically &#x27;French&#x27; in its apparent insistence on the primacy of theory over politics. Nonetheless, in practice the French women&#x27;s movement developed in much the same way as the feminist movements elsewhere in Europe or in the United States: French women participated in consciousness-raising groups; demonstrated in the streets on the 8 March; fought hard for women&#x27;s right to choose whether to have children; raised the issue of violence against women; and struggled to change public opinion on issues concerning women and women&#x27;s rights.

Further criticisms of écriture féminine include what some claim is an essentialist view of the body and the consequential reliance on a feminism of &#x27;difference&#x27; which, according to Diana Holmes, for instance, tends to &quot;demonize masculinity as the repository of all that (at least from a post-&#x27;68, broadly Left perspective) is negative.&quot; It also, says Holmes in &quot;French Women&#x27;s Writings, 1848-1994&quot; (1996), would exclude much of women&#x27;s writing from the feminist canon.

==Literary examples==

As a result of the difficulties inherent in the notion of &quot;écriture féminine&quot;, very few books of literary criticism have run the risk of using it as a critical tool. A. S. Byatt offers: &quot;There is a marine and salty female wave-water to be...read as a symbol of female language, which is partly suppressed, partly self-communing, dumb before the intruding male and not able to speak out...thus mirroring those female secretions which are not inscribed in our daily use of language (&quot;langue&quot;, tongue)&quot;.

<text>United States Senate Committee on Civil Service is a defunct committee of the United States Senate. 

The first standing Senate committee with jurisdiction over the civil service was the United States Senate Committee on Civil Service and [[Retrenchment]], which was established on December 4, 1873, following unanimous approval of a resolution introduced by Henry B. Anthony of Rhode Island. On April 18, 1921, the committee was renamed the United States Senate Committee on Civil Service. 

The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 retained the Committee on Civil Service and established the committee&#x27;s jurisdiction over all the aspects of civil service, the Census Bureau and the government&#x27;s gathering of statistics, and the National Archives. The act also transferred to the committee jurisdiction over the postal service. On April 17, 1947, as specified by of the 80th United States Congress, the committee&#x27;s name was changed from the Committee on Civil Service to the United States Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service.

* [[United States Special Committee to Investigate the Administration of the Civil Service System]], 1938-1941 (75th-76th Congresses)

<text>Callenish Circle was an extreme metal band from the Netherlands. They recorded three of their albums for Metal Blade Records, and broke up in February 2007. In the early 2000s things were going well for the band. In 2002 they toured with God Dethroned, played at the Dutch version of Ozzfest and the German Party San Open Air, and opened for Dimmu Borgir. Their fourth album was released by Metal Blade in 2003; to support it they played that year&#x27;s Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze festivals in Germany, and in October they were part of the Bonded By Metal Over Europe-tour, headlined by Exodus, Nuclear Assault, and Agent Steel. In 2006 they toured Mexico (cited by the band as the high point of their career), before they decided to break up in 2007.

A part of their song “Suffer My Disbelief” is used as an outro in the online review show Angry Joe Show.

<text>The [[United States Senate]] Committee on Claims was among the first standing committees established in the Senate. It dealt generally with issues related to private bills and petitions. After reforms in the 1880s that created judicial and administrative remedies for petitioners, it declined in importance, and were abolished in 1947.

The United States House of Representatives also had a Committee on Claims until 1946, when its duties were absorbed by the United States House Committee on the Judiciary.

<doc id="854836" wikidata="Q137144" url="?curid=854836" title="Conger">
<text>Conger ( ) is a genus of marine congrid eels. It includes some of the largest types of eels, ranging up to 2 m (6 ft) or more in length, in the case of the European conger. Large congers have often been observed by divers during the day in parts of the Mediterranean Sea, and both European and American congers are sometimes caught by fishermen along the European and North American Atlantic coasts.

The life histories of most conger eels are poorly known. Based on collections of their small leptocephalus larvae, the American conger eel has been found to spawn in the southwestern Sargasso Sea, close to the spawning areas of the Atlantic freshwater eels.

&quot;Conger&quot; or &quot;conger eel&quot; is sometimes included in the common names of species of the family Congridae, including members of this genus.

== Description ==
Congers have wide mouths with sturdy teeth, usually a variant of gray or black in coloration. They have no scales. Their body weight can reach over 57 kilograms (125 lbs).

==Species==
* †&quot;Conger brevisulcus&quot; 
* &quot;Conger cinereus&quot; (longfin African conger)
* &quot;Conger conger&quot; (European conger)
* †&quot;Conger davidsmithi&quot; 
* &quot;Conger erebennus&quot; (Anaconger)
* &quot;Conger esculentus&quot; (grey conger)
* &quot;Conger japonicus&quot; Bleeker, 1879
* &quot;Conger jordani&quot; Kanazawa, 1958
* &quot;Conger macrocephalus&quot; 
* &quot;Conger marginatus&quot; (Hawaiian Mustache Conger)
* &quot;Conger melanopterus&quot; 
* &quot;Conger monganius&quot; 
* &quot;Conger myriaster&quot; (whitespotted conger)
* &quot;Conger oceanicus&quot; (American conger)
* &quot;Conger oligoporus&quot; 
* &quot;Conger orbignianus&quot; (Argentine conger)
* &quot;Conger philippinus&quot; 
* †&quot;Conger tokoroa&quot; 
* &quot;Conger triporiceps&quot; (manytooth conger)
* &quot;Conger verreauxi&quot; (southern conger)
* &quot;Conger wilsoni&quot; (Cape conger)

===Formerly Included Species===
* &quot;Conger anagoides&quot; (sea conger) - now &quot;Ariosoma anagoides&quot;
* &quot;Conger auratus&quot; (bandtooth conger) - now &quot;Ariosoma balearicum&quot;

==Fishing==
Fishing for congers was first recorded in the 12th century. The Norman taxation Pipe Roll recorded two &quot;éperquerie&quot; on Guernsey and one on Sark. These were designated places where congers were dried.

One species of the conger eel, &quot;Conger myriaster&quot;, is an important food fish in East Asia. It is often served as sushi.

==Behaviour==
Congers are predators and can attack humans. In July 2013, a diver was attacked by a European conger eel in Killary Harbour, Ireland, at a depth of . The eel bit a large chunk from his face. The diver reported the creature was more than in length and &quot;about the width of a human thigh&quot;.

==History==

Due to its favourable geographic location, together with excellent natural climate characteristics, Kočani was inhabited as early as the ancient times first by the Paionians, Meds and Thracians.
Later on, in the 6th century the Slavs inhabited parts of the region. More precisely, in the 7th century members of the Slavic tribe Smolyani colonized the Kočani valley and built a fortification. The founders of the Slavic education, brothers Kiril and Metodij (Cyril and Methodius), stayed in the valley from the year 845 to 855 and in the Bregalnica area (Morodvis) started to preach Christianity in Slavic language.

Although the settlement existed long before that, Kočani was first mentioned in a charter from 1337 in which Despot Jovan Oliver donated the church of St. Dimitrija to Kočani.

Archaeological finds in the town itself have revealed remains of a settlement here in the Roman and Byzantine periods. Early in the 15th century it fell under Turkish rule. The travel chronicler Evliya Çelebi, who visited it in 1662, recorded that it had 600 households, a mosque, a mezjid, an inn and 15 handicraft stores. During the 18th and in the early 19th century, the town growth rate stagnated. It was only around 1878 that the population began to rise, at which time it had about 450–500 households. The town has two feudal residences in the shape of towers believed to date from the 16th - 17th century.

==Monuments==
Numerous cultural and historical monuments, from ancient times to the Middle Ages, can be found in the vicinity of Kočani. One of them is an archeological site of Dolno Gradishte from the late antic period, and two medieval towers at the city center.

Monastery complexes in the nearby villages Morodvis and Panteley are world-famous both for their architecture and unique frescoes.

==Features==

The town green, especially along the river bed and banks of the Kočani river, is the pride of the local people. The town is very clean and neat, for which it has proudly held the prestigious title of the cleanest town in North Macedonia.

Today Kočani is a modern town with planned infrastructure, avenues, many modern buildings and blocks of flats, a hospital, a shopping centre, a park and a newly built industrial zone. All this is carefully planned and structured, according to modern standards of living and esthetics. New suburbs are mainly built to the east where the town almost reaches the first houses of Orizari and to the West spreading over the industrial zone.

<text>God Dethroned is a Dutch extreme metal band from Beilen, originally formed in 1990.

==Biography==
God Dethroned was formed in 1990 by singer and guitar player Henri Sattler, with Hans Leegstra (guitar) and Ard de Weerd. Sattler and Leegstra had previously been in Dysentery; Leegstra, quickly after the band formed, left the music scene altogether. They recorded a demo, &quot;Christ Hunt&quot;, in 1991, after which Marco Arends joined on bass. Their first album, &quot;The Christhunt&quot;, was released on the German label Shark. Meanwhile, Arends left (to rejoin Altar) and was replaced by Marcel Beukeveld. &quot;The Christhunt&quot; did poorly; the label had refused to feature a dissected rat on the cover and did not promote the record at all. Dethroned went on hiatus the following year, in part because Sattler&#x27;s anti-Christian sympathy was not shared by all, and Sattler formed a new group called Ministry of Terror. In 1996, after that band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Fall of Life&quot; and a supporting European tour (with Impaled Nazarene), Sattler re-formed God Dethroned with guitarist Jens van der Valk (who did not share Sattler&#x27;s anti-Christian sympathies either), bassist Beef, and drummer Roel Sanders. With this lineup a deal was signed with Metal Blade, and they issued &quot;The Grand Grimoire&quot; in Europe in 1997; the album was released in the U.S. the following year, along with a re-issue of &quot;The Christhunt&quot;, which featured the original cover art, with the dissected rat.

The Grand Grimorie did much better than The Christhunt did, and the band soon entered into a sort of high point. The lineup of Sattler, Van Der Valk, Beef and Sanders would record the album &quot;Bloody Blasphemy&quot;, which many fans of the band consider to be their best work to date. Successful tours and shows with bands like Marduk, Immortal, and Deicide would later follow. After &quot;Bloody Blasphemy&quot;, Sanders soon left the band and was replaced by Puerto Rican drummer Tony Laureano. Laureano played with the band up till 2003, when he received an offer to join the American death metal band Nile. He would record only one album with the band: 2001&#x27;s &quot;Ravenous&quot;. 

A new drummer was found, Ariën Van Weesenbeek, and the band entered the studio at the end of 2002 to record &quot;Into the Lungs of Hell&quot;. More problems began to follow, as Beef and Jens were tired with the direction of the band and wanted to push for a more heavy and extreme sound with more anti-Christian lyrics (themes that had begun to start to fade to an extent on &quot;Ravenous&quot;), whereas Sattler wanted to keep the band at a more melodic and darker sound with lyrics focused more on darkness, horror, nihilism, and other themes. After the recording and a short amount of touring for &quot;Into the Lungs of Hell&quot;, both the bassist and guitarist left the band, and Henri Sattler had to go look out for members once again. Bassist Henk Zinger was quickly brought into the fold, and Ariën van Weesenbeek recommended Belgian guitarist Isaac Delahaye to the band. This lineup would finish up the remaining tour dates and would go back into the studio to record another album, 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot;.

After touring for a little while, the band then went back into the studio with legendary producer Rick Rubin, and released &quot;The Toxic Touch&quot; in 2006 through American.

In January 2008, two personnel changes were made. Since Ariën van Weesenbeek had joined Dutch symphonic metal band Epica full-time in December 2007, he was replaced with former drummer Roel Sanders. After a writing period, &quot;Passiondale&quot; was recorded and released in early 2009. The album&#x27;s concept is based on The Battle of Passchendaele during World War I. Once the album was completed, auditions were held and Susan Gerl was selected as the new guitar player. Shortly after the release Roel Sanders was asked to leave the band and Michiel Van Der Plicht was brought in.

In 2010, Henri Sattler stated in a Metal Blade Press release:&quot;We are halfway through the writing process for a new album, which we will record starting end of May. First, we&#x27;ll play on the Killfest tour in the U.S. supporting Overkill together with label mates Woe of Tyrants and many other great bands.

Abigail Williams&#x27; axeman Ian Jekelis will take over touring duties for Susan, with whom we parted ways last January. We will announce the name of our new shredder right before we play our first European festival in May&quot;

Shortly after, guitarist Danny Tunker (Prostitute Disfigurement, Detonation) was announced as the new lead guitarist.

The new God Dethroned album &quot;Under The Sign Of The Iron Cross&quot; was released through Metal Blade on 22 November 2010 and met rave reviews. It marked the first time God Dethroned became &#x27;Album Of The Month&#x27; in the Netherlands&#x27; Aardschok magazine.

Sattler announced that 2011 will be the last year of the band and their final show will be in December, but they performed at 70000 Tons of Metal festival in January 2012, after which they officially disbanded.

Sattler announced that the band will reunite in 2015, performing at the 70,000 Tons of Metal Festival in January. While they will only be a &quot;small selection of shows,&quot; according to Sattler, the band does have more shows planned for 2015. But later on, God Dethroned played a lot of shows and in 2017 they even recorded a new album &quot;The World Ablaze&quot;.

&quot;The World Ablaze&quot; is the third album of the band&#x27;s World War I trilogy. The album got high ranks in metal charts. With lead guitarist Mike Ferguson and bass guitarist Jeroen Pomper, God Dethroned released &quot;Illuminati&quot; on 7 February 2020.

The band&#x27;s newest release, &quot;The Judas Paradox&quot;, was released on 6 September 2024.

==Musical style==
God Dethroned originally formed as a death metal band. When they reformed in 1996, they switched to blackened death metal and stayed that way until the release of &quot;Into the Lungs of Hell&quot;, when they shifted to melodic death metal. They are, however, &quot;an important part of the Dutch black metal scene&quot;, according to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Dutch Black Metal&quot;. Their latest albums saw a return to their original blackened death metal sound.

<text>The [[United States Senate]] Committee on Commerce and Manufactures was one of the original standing committees created in the Senate in 1816, but it only lasted nine years, when it was split into the Committee on Commerce and the Committee on Manufactures. It functions are now under the jurisdiction of the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

==History and activities==
The Committee on Commerce and Manufactures was established as one of the original standing committees, following adoption of a resolution proposed by James Barbour of Virginia on December 10, 1816. The committee&#x27;s records consist of petitions and memorials referred to the committee for the whole period and committee reports and papers from 1818.

With its brief existence, the records show substantial committee activity, especially regarding petitions received. In all Congresses the principle record subjects are tariffs and the regulation of shipping and revenue collection. Other subjects included the welfare of sick and disabled seamen between the 15th and 17th Congress, and harbor improvements such as lighthouses between the 16th and 18th Congress. The single most prominent subject was tariffs, particularly the protectionist Tariff of 1824 in the 18th Congress. From its beginning, the committee received petitions and memorials from various individuals or groups seeking protection for their particular industry, as well as a few from agricultural interests, such as those from various agricultural societies of Virginia, seeking less tariff protection (17th). Many memorials requesting higher duties on imported iron and products manufactured from iron were received, mainly from citizens of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, during the debate of the 1824 tariff. Prominent textile manufacturer Samuel Slater and other Rhode Island citizens also memorialized the Senate about the 1824 tariff. Other activities relating to shipping and revenue collection include registration of vessels, establishment of new collection districts and ports of entry, and collection of duties on sales at auction.

The Tariff of 1824 was a pivotal issue for the committee&#x27;s established existence. In December 1825, the chairman, Mahlon Dickerson of New Jersey, proposed that the committee be split into separate committees—one for commerce and one for manufactures. Dickerson, a protectionist, believed that it was &quot;improper to blend two subjects so distinct from each other as Commerce and Manufactures&quot; and he was supported in his proposal by fellow Senator James Lloyd of Massachusetts, a free trader, who thought that low tariff advocates on the existing committee were a distinct minority. On the other hand, Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina argued that such a division reflected narrow, sectional interests, and alternatively proposed that agriculture be added to give a single committee oversight of the Nation&#x27;s economic interests. Dickerson&#x27;s motion was adopted and the committee was split.

==Chairmen==
*William Hunter (F-RI) 1816-1817
*Nathan Sanford (DR-NY) 1817-1820

<text>Tsui is a surname. It is an alternative transcription of two Chinese surnames, namely Cuī () and Xú ().

==Origins==
Tsui may be an alternative transliteration of two separate Chinese surnames, listed below by their Hanyu Pinyin transliteration (which reflects the Mandarin pronunciation):

*Cuī (), which originated as a toponymic surname from a fief by that name in the state of Qi; a grandson of Jiang Ziya renounced his claim to the throne and went to live in that fief, and his descendants took its name as their surname. It is spelled Ts&#x27;ui in the Wade–Giles system of transliterating Mandarin (which remains common in Taiwan and was used elsewhere until the mid-to-late 20th century). The spelling Tsui may also be based on the Cantonese pronunciation ().
*Xú (), which originated as a toponymic surname from the ancient state of Xu, adopted by the descendants of Boyi after the state was annexed by the state of Chu. The spelling Tsui is based on its Cantonese pronunciation (); it is nearly homophonous with the above surname in Cantonese aside from the differing tone.

==Statistics==
The 2010 United States Census found 3,168 people with the surname Tsui, making it the 10,180th-most-common name in the country. This represented an increase from 2,725 (10,748th-most-common) in the 2000 Census. In both censuses, more than nine-tenths of the bearers of the surname identified as Asian, and roughly two percent as White.

<text>Wightwick ( ) is a part of Tettenhall Wightwick ward in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. It is named after an ancient local family the &quot;de Wightwicks&quot;. It is on the western fringe of Wolverhampton and borders the rural South Staffordshire area that includes neighbourhoods such as Perton.

Of note is Wightwick Manor, a Victorian era manor house in the arts and crafts style. The interior features extensive use of William Morris designs and is noted as one of his pioneering works. The house is the former home of the Mander family who achieved wealth through the ownership of Mander Brothers, paint and varnish manufacturers since 1773, and fame through public service and political office. Sir Geoffrey Le Mesurier Mander was the first of the Mander family to sit in the House of Commons. The house is now in the hands of the National Trust. The Mander family also owned the nearby &#x27;Mount&#x27;, seat of the Mander Baronets, which is now a hotel and conference centre with views as far as the Malvern hills, over away.

Wightwick Hall is also in the area, being less than a mile via the lanes that connect the two properties. Sir Alfred Hickman owned Wightwick Hall. Nearby Elmsdale Hall was owned by the former Wolverhampton Mayor and industrialist Sir John Morris. Morris was spontaneously knighted by Queen Victoria in 1866 at her first public appearance since the death of her husband Albert, for the unveiling of a statue of her dead husband. The hall has been converted to residential apartments.

The Staffordshire and Worcestershire canal and the Smestow Brook run through the valley beneath Wightwick Manor, roughly parallel to the &#x27;Bridgnorth Road&#x27;.

Wightwick is an extremely pleasant part of the more traditionally affluent western side of Wolverhampton.

<doc id="854871" wikidata="Q15707852" url="?curid=854871" title="Trivet">
<text>A trivet is an object placed between a serving dish, bowl, pot, or pan and a dining table, usually to protect the table from heat damage. The word &quot;trivet&quot; refers to three feet, but the term is sometimes used in British English to refer to trivets with four feet or no feet. 

&quot;Trivet&quot; also refers to a tripod used to elevate pots from the coals of an open fire (the word &quot;trivet&quot; itself ultimately comes from Latin &quot;tripes&quot; meaning &quot;tripod&quot;). Metal trivets are often tripod-like structures with three legs to support the trivet horizontally to hold the dish or pot above the table surface. These are often included with modern non-electric pressure cookers. A trivet may often contain a receptacle for a candle that can be lit to keep food warm.

A three-legged design can reduce wobbling on uneven surfaces.

Modern trivets are made from metal, wood, ceramic, fabric, silicone or cork.

When roasting any meat in an oven, trivet racks - which typically fit into roasting pans - are often used to enable the meat joint to be held above the direct heat of the roasting pan and allow the juices of the joint to drip into the roasting pan for the subsequent making of gravy. A trivet can also be made of freshly cut carrot, celery and onion. This not only raises the meat, it has the further advantage of providing a gravy-friendly liquid when the vegetables and juices are sieved at the end of cooking.

==History==
Trivets have been in use since antiquity, and are sometimes referred to as &quot;fire stands&quot;. In the tomb of the Chinese ruler Zhao Mo (2nd century BCE) were found several metal trivets that had been used by him during his lifetime, now stored at the Museum of the Mausoleum of the Nanyue King. Fire-stands were also uncovered at archaeological sites in Israel, dating back to the Philistine time-period (&quot;circa&quot; 1st millennium BCE).

<text>The [[United States Senate]] Committee on Corporations Organized in the District of Columbia was formed as a select committee in 1892, and became a standing committee in 1896. In 1921, it was abolished.

Robert M. La Follette had the distinction of chairing the committee during the 63rd through the 65th Congress, even though he was a member of the minority Republican Party. This was because the Senate had 73 standing committees in the 63rd Congress, several more than there were Democrats to chair them. Therefore, some members of the minority party were allowed to chair certain minor committees.

<doc id="854874" wikidata="Q557887" url="?curid=854874" title="Erik Morales">
<text>Erik Isaac Morales Elvira (born September 1, 1976) is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1993 to 2012. He is the first Mexico-born boxer in history to win world championships in four weight classes, ranging from super bantamweight to light welterweight.

Morales defeated fifteen world champions during the course of his career, and is famous for his trilogies with fellow Mexican legend Marco Antonio Barrera, as well as Manny Pacquiao. ESPN ranked Morales at number 49 on their list of the 50 greatest boxers of all time.

Morales was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in June 2018.

==Career history==

===Early career===
Erik Morales was born in the Zona Norte section of Tijuana. Under the tutelage of his father, José Morales, a fighter himself, Erik started boxing at the age of five and amassed a very impressive amateur career that totaled 114 fights (108–6), winning 11 major titles in Mexico in the process. Morales made his professional debut at the age of 16 by knocking out Jose Orejel in two rounds. Between 1993 and 1997, he quickly climbed the ranks in the super bantamweight division, winning 26 fights, 20 by knockout, including wins against former champions Kenny Mitchell and Hector Acero Sánchez, before challenging for his first world title. It was during this time that he signed with promoter Bob Arum.

===Super bantamweight===

====Morales vs. Zaragoza====
On September 6, 1997, in El Paso, Texas, at the age of 21, he won his first world title by stopping WBC Super Bantamweight Champion and now member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Daniel Zaragoza, via knockout in eleven rounds.

In his first defense, Morales defeated John Lowey (24–2) by knockout in the seventh round. In his next fight, he defeated Remigio Molina (31–1) by knockout in the 6th round. On May 16, 1998, he defeated former champion Jose Luis Bueno via knockout in the second round.

====Morales vs. Jones====
In September 1998, in another landmark fight, Morales knocked out former two-weight world champion Junior Jones of the United States. Jones went into the battle with a daunting record against Mexican fighters of 35 victories and no losses, most notably including two victories over the previous champion, Marco Antonio Barrera, in 1996 and 1997. Also noteworthy was that Jones was entering México for the first time to fight, and the fight was held at Tijuana. The fight went on to three contested rounds, before Morales knocked out Jones with two consecutive overhead right crosses in the fourth round.

In October 1999, Morales fought and defeated former WBC Bantamweight Champion Wayne McCullough of Northern Ireland, saying that McCullough gave him one of the three toughest fights of his career.

====Morales vs. Barrera I====

In February 2000, Morales defeated Marco Antonio Barrera to win the WBO Super Bantamweight title, in a fight that is now considered one of boxing&#x27;s classics. Morales won the fight by a controversial split decision. It was an intense battle in which both fighters were cut and battered. Many people thought Barrera had won the fight on a knockdown that he scored in the twelfth and final round. After the fight, Morales said, &quot;He was a brave fighter, and we both gave it all we had. We were both hurt during the fight. He was the biggest puncher I ever faced in the ring.&quot; &quot;The Ring&quot; named it the Fight of the Year.

===Featherweight===
After nine successful title defenses, Morales chose to vacate his WBC Super Bantamweight title to move up to featherweight division. In his second fight at this weight, he fought 33-year-old former world champion Kevin Kelley, in September 2000. Kelley was knocked down in the fifth and seventh rounds, he was finally trapped in the latter round by a flurry of five consecutive uppercuts from Morales. Supported only by the ropes, a sixth uppercut landed, and the fight was stopped. Morales became the Interim WBC Featherweight Champion.

====Morales vs. Espadas Jr.====
Morales fought again in 2000, knocking out Rodney Jones in the first round. In February 2001, he fought Guty Espadas Jr., the WBC Featherweight title holder with a thirteen fight winning streak, and whose father, Guty Espadas, Sr., was also a world champion boxer. Morales won a close twelve-round decision to claim his third world title in his second weight division. Although Morales was highly rated in the featherweight division, Naseem Hamed was seen as the Lineal Champion of the division.

In July 2001, Morales defeated future champion In Jin Chi of South Korea and retained his title. Chi gave a strong effort, but Morales was the sharper, harder puncher and outworked him for much of the fight. Morales was cut and swollen over the left eye in the sixth round by an accidental clash of heads and Chi was penalized one point in the tenth round.

====Morales vs. Barrera II====

Morales then tasted defeat for the first time in his 42nd professional fight when he lost (this time) a controversial majority decision and his WBC title against Lineal Champion, Marco Antonio Barrera in June 2002, in a re-match of their February 2000 fight. Morales constantly pressed forward and dominated much of the first half of the fight (clearly winning at least 4 of the first 6 rounds). He was cut on the bridge of the nose in the 2nd round, and cut and swollen over his right eye in the 8th. However, he punched Barrera to the canvas during the middle rounds but this was called a slip. Barrera fought cautiously in the early rounds, but rallied as the fight progressed, although Morales seemed to narrowly win rounds 10 and 11, which when including his dominance in the first half of the fight, seemed to seal him the close victory on the score-cards. HBO&#x27;s unofficial ring-side scorer: Harold Lederman, scored the fight 115–113 (7 rounds to 5) for Morales.

====Second Featherweight title reign====

Morales bounced back with a dominating twelve-round decision victory over former world champion, Paulie Ayala in November 2002 to regain the vacant WBC Featherweight title. The early rounds were close, but Morales started to dominate in the middle rounds, consistently landing the harder punches and Ayala&#x27;s left eye began to swell. He slowed his pace in the late rounds and Ayala rallied, but Morales rocked him with a series of punches in the 12th round.

Morales defeated Eddie Croft in March 2003. He scored three knockdowns and stopped Croft in the 3rd round. All the fighters on the card donated their purses to &quot;Vamos Mexico,&quot; a children&#x27;s charity headed by Marta Sahagun, wife of Mexican president Vicente Fox.

Morales defeated Fernando Velárdez later that year. He knocked down Velárdez in the 1st, 4th and 5th rounds when the fight was stopped without a count.

===Super featherweight===
====Morales vs. Espadas Jr. II====
In October 2003, Morales defeated Guty Espadas Jr. in a rematch of their first close fight, which was also a WBC Super Featherweight title eliminator. This time Morales knocked him out in three rounds. Morales vacated his WBC Featherweight title immediately after the bout, remaining in the super featherweight division.

====Morales vs. Chávez====
On February 28, 2004, Morales captured the WBC Super Featherweight title by unanimous decision over Jesús Chávez. Morales twice knocked down Chávez, which Floyd Mayweather Jr. had been unable to do. Morales was rocked midway through the 1st round, but he came back to score two knockdowns in the 2nd round and managed to cut Chavez over the left eye. Chavez injured his right shoulder early in the fight and threw very few right hands, but still fought aggressively for the rest of the fight with his jab and left hooks which cut Morales over the eye in the 4th round. With the victory he became the second Mexican boxer to win a title at three separate weight divisions, the first being the acclaimed Julio César Chávez.

On July 31, 2004, Morales unified his WBC Super Featherweight title with the IBF version by way of a twelve-round unanimous decision over Carlos Hernández. Hernández constantly pressed forward, but Morales boxed effectively consistently landing the harder, more accurate punches that rocked Hernández several times.

====Morales vs. Barrera III====

On November 27, 2004, Morales fought Barrera for the third time in a bout for the WBC Super Featherweight title. Their highly anticipated third battle drew a capacity crowd of over 11,000. Barrera started fast and rocked Morales late in the first round and bloodied his nose in the second. Morales came back strongly in the second half of the fight and won four of the last six rounds on two judges&#x27; scorecards. However, the judges scored the bout 114–114, 114–115, 113–115 in favor of Barrera, in what was justifiably a very, very close, but non-controversial and justifiable win for Barrera. Their third meeting was once again named &quot;The Ring&quot; Fight of the Year.

====Morales vs. Pacquiao I====

On March 19, 2005, as a betting underdog, Morales defeated then three-division world champion Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, by a unanimous decision. During the 12th round, Morales, comfortably ahead on the scorecards, decided to brawl with the Filipino slugger, even turning southpaw during the process. In a post fight interview, HBO broadcaster Larry Merchant, asked Morales, &quot;Why?&quot; Morales replied by asking a question of his own, &quot;Did you enjoy it? That&#x27;s why.&quot;

Later that night, at the post-fight press conference, Erik further explained his reasoning for brawling with the Filipino slugger; &quot;It was a great pleasure to fight this way. I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need to put a little flavor into the ring. My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they&#x27;re not difficult, they&#x27;re fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I&#x27;m very happy about it.&quot;

===Lightweight===
====Morales vs. Raheem====

On September 10, 2005, Erik Morales moved up to the lightweight division and was defeated by unanimous decision by Zahir Raheem. Raheem frustrated Morales with constant lateral movement. Raheem rocked Morales in the 5th round and built a lead on the scorecards, but Morales rallied in the 11th round and staggered him with a right hand as Raheem&#x27;s glove touched the canvas, but it was not scored a knockdown by referee Jon Schorle. The final scores were 118–110, 116–112 and 115–112 in favor of Raheem.

===Return to Super featherweight===
====Morales vs. Pacquiao II &amp; III====

On January 22, 2006, Morales fought Pacquiao in a rematch from their bout ten months before and was defeated in ten rounds. Pacquiao knocked down Morales twice in the final seconds of round ten and the fight was stopped.

He fought Pacquiao for the third time in a non-championship title bout, on November 18, 2006. Morales was defeated by a knockout in three rounds. After the fight, Morales said &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s time I should no longer be doing this.&quot; He sat speechless in his corner for five minutes afterward. &quot;I did everything in camp necessary to win this fight. I didn&#x27;t win it. It wasn&#x27;t my night...it just wasn&#x27;t meant to be.&quot; Asked by Larry Merchant whether he would retire from boxing, Morales offered, &quot;Maybe this is the way to end it. It&#x27;s a beautiful night, and there&#x27;s a lot of good people (here in the audience)...it was always a pleasure to give the public great fights.&quot;

===Return to Lightweight===
Morales moved up to the lightweight division in search of a possible fourth WBC title. During a holiday visit to the Philippines in January 2007, Morales told a local newspaper that he was fighting again but declined to name his next opponent. He stated that he had unfinished business in the boxing ring and was determined to regain recognition as a world champion. He also expressed his desire to become the first Mexican fighter to win four WBC titles in different divisions and surpass Julio César Chávez&#x27;s record by campaigning at the lightweight class of .

====Morales vs. Díaz====
On August 4, 2007, Morales fought David Díaz for the WBC Lightweight title and lost a close unanimous decision at the Allstate Arena. Judges Herminio, Cuevas Collazo and Robert Hecko both scored Round 1, 10–9 Morales, even though Morales knocked down Díaz in that round. Collazo then went on to score Round 2, 10–8 for Diaz, when not only did a knockdown not occur, but the two other judges saw it as a Morales round. The final scores read 114–113 (Collazo), 115–113 (Hecko) and 115–112 (Uratani), all in favor of Díaz. It was Morales&#x27; fifth loss in his last six bouts. During the post-fight press conference, Morales announced his retirement from boxing.

===Comeback===

In various interviews conducted in 2009, Morales began to state that he would fight again in late 2009 to early 2010, after he gave his body enough time to rest. Morales also stated that he would continue to fight as a lightweight.

His first comeback fight was then set for México in early 2010, against ranked Nicaraguan welterweight contender José Alfaro.

===Light welterweight===

====Morales vs. Maidana====

On April 9, 2011, the MGM Grand Garden Arena hosted HBO Pay Per View&#x27;s &quot;Action Heroes.&quot; The main event featured Erik Morales fighting against Marcos Rene Maidana.

Many boxing pundits felt that an aging Morales, fighting a couple of divisions above his best weight, stood little chance against the hard hitting Maidana. However, Morales turned back the clock and gave his best performance since beating Pacquiao. The opening bell saw Maidana jump on the older Morales. Morales&#x27; eye was badly swollen in the first round by a series of hard shots, especially a devastating uppercut, and it looked like the rout was on. However, Morales held his own through the next few rounds before rallying in the 8th–10th rounds. Although Maidana was using combos to hurt &quot;El Terrible,&quot; Morales started turning the tide mid-fight, throwing very heavy counter-punches and almost knocking Maidana down. However, just when the fight seemed within Morales&#x27; grasp, Maidana took over by throwing combos, giving him the final rounds of the fight. Morales put up a valiant effort, performed better than anyone thought possible, won the crowd over and gave the boxing public another &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; candidate. However, it just wasn&#x27;t enough. In the end, Maidana&#x27;s youth and Morales&#x27; age and mileage were just too much to overcome, and Maidana eked out a majority decision victory with scores of 114–114 and 116–112 twice.

====Morales vs. Cano====
Morales was due to fight WBO Inter-Continental Light Welterweight Champion Lucas Matthysse as an undercard to the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Victor Ortiz bout. Matthysse pulled out of the bout, citing a viral infection.

On September 17, 2011, Morales won the WBC Light Welterweight Championship with a win over un-rated Pablo César Cano. The title had been vacant after previous champion Timothy Bradley&#x27;s status had contentiously been changed to &quot;Champ in Recess&quot; due to inactivity. Many including experts and commentators saw the title won by Morales as a paper championship. Following Morales&#x27; win, he would be rated No.7 on Ring Magazine&#x27;s light welterweight ratings, with all other title holders and highly rated contenders ranked above him. Morales is the inaugural Mexico-born boxer to win world titles in four different weight classes.

====Morales vs. Garcia I &amp; II====

On March 24, 2012, Morales faced 23-year-old Danny García (22–0 14 KO&#x27;s) in another chapter of the storied &quot;Puerto Rico vs. Mexico&quot; boxing rivalry. García entered the contest following victories over former titleholders Nate Campbell and Kendall Holt. However, Morales attended the weigh-in over two pounds above the light welterweight limit. He remained champion until the fight, but only García could win the belt by defeating him, as a Morales win would vacate it. Morales lost by unanimous decision.

Morales fought on October 20, 2012, on a rematch with now &quot;The Ring&quot;, WBC &amp; WBA (Super) Light Welterweight Champion Danny Garcia. He was knocked out by Danny Garcia in the 4th round, the fight was aired on Showtime Boxing. Here is how FOX Sports described how Danny Garcia knocked out Erik Morales:

&quot;Morales is dancing in the opening seconds but is that because he&#x27;s got a second wind or because he still doesn&#x27;t know where he is. He did head to the wrong corner at the end of the last round.

This is a bad omen folks. Garcia is tapping Morales&#x27; guard with his left hand, literally telling Morales where the next shot is going to come. After four taps, Morales decides it&#x27;s time to get aggressive. Bad move. Garcia blasts Morales with a left hook that launches Morales through the ropes. You can see it in Morales&#x27; eyes, he&#x27;s not getting back up. KO for Garcia.&quot;

==Doping allegations==
Prior to Morales-Garcia rematch on October 20, 2012, United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) conducted two random drug tests (Oct 3 and 10, 2012). Morales was tested positive for use of the banned substance Clenbuterol, a weight-loss drug, it reduces fat deposits and is believed to increase muscle mass. Although the New York State Athletic Commission was notified 24 hours in advance of the Garcia-Morales bout regarding Morales’ positive drug test results, the legal process was still ongoing. The NYSAC allowed the fight to proceed.

==Retirement==
In March 2013, Morales revealed plans to fight at least once more. “The idea is to make a nice party for the farewell of my career,” he said. “I’ve had a 20-year career. “(The party is) not only for me, but for the people who stood by me – my father, my mother, my brothers, the fans, the press, especially the coaches, trainers, doctors, sparring partners and all of those who helped prepare me and demanded me to be better every day. But mostly, my children and my wife, who often had to endure my absence for long periods of time. This is not just for me, but for everyone involved in my career,” Morales said. In June 2014, Morales officially announced his retirement forgoing a farewell fight.

===Rape allegations===
On January 9, 2024, it was announced that a 54-year-old woman alleged that Morales sexually abused and harassed her in June 2013 at Morales&#x27; gym, &quot;Box Platino&quot; in Tijuana.

==Outside the ring==
Morales was trained and managed by his father José Morales and was promoted by Bob Arum and Top Rank. His brothers are Iván Morales and former WBO Super Flyweight Champion Diego Morales. Erik has four children.

Erik Morales currently spends his time managing a $3.5 million budget running the parks and recreation department in Tijuana. Morales donates his salary back to the department to further help fund it. Morales was quoted as saying, &quot;This is just a way for me to be able to thank the people who have been so good to me all my life.&quot;

On May 30, 2015, Morales agreed to train former light welterweight champion Jessie Vargas for his then-upcoming fight with Timothy Bradley. Morales replaced world champion Roy Jones Jr. as the head trainer Vargas&#x27;s corner.

It was announced on December 1, 2021, that one of Morales&#x27; sons, 23-year-old Fernando, had died. Fernando&#x27;s cause of death was not immediately known.

==Political career==
In July 2018, Morales won a seat at the Chamber of Deputies (Mexican Congress) for Baja California. He currently serves in the legislative body&#x27;s committee on sports.

<text>Pestilence is a Dutch death metal band founded in Enschede in 1986. They have been through various membership changes throughout their existence, with guitarist-vocalist Patrick Mameli as the sole constant member. After disbanding in order to pursue other musical directions in 1994, Pestilence reunited in 2008, and was put on a &quot;permanent hold&quot; in July 2014. However, the band reunited once again in October 2016. To date, Pestilence has released ten studio albums, and they are one of &quot;technical death metal&#x27;s Big Four&quot;, along with Death, Atheist, and Cynic.

==History==
===Early career (1986–1990)===
Pestilence started in the Netherlands in mid-1986 as a thrash metal band. The
lineup, consisting of Patrick Mameli (guitar, vocals), Randy Meinhard (guitar), and Marco Foddis (drums), recorded two demos before gaining the attention of Roadrunner Records. After the first demo, Martin van Drunen (bass, vocals) joined them. After signing with Roadrunner, Pestilence released their debut album, &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, in 1988, further refining their approach to thrash metal.

Meanwhile, Pestilence recruited a new guitar player, Patrick Uterwijk. In 1989, the band released their second album, &quot;Consuming Impulse&quot;, a turn toward death metal. Musically, things became heavier and more haunting. Vocally, Martin van Drunen moved away from cleaner vocals in favour of a more acidic growl. With its release, Pestilence gained international attention, and became highly regarded worldwide by death metal fans. The band embarked on a tour to support the album, playing a series of dates with Celtic Frost, Death, Carcass, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel and Bolt Thrower, among others. By the time they began working on their third album, the lineup changed once again; vocalist and bassist Martin van Drunen departed to front Asphyx.

===Success and breakthrough (1991–1994)===
Pestilence were faced with the challenge of replacing another member once again, being now without a vocalist and bassist. For their third album &quot;Testimony of the Ancients&quot; (1991), they enlisted bassist Tony Choy from death metal band Cynic while Patrick Mameli took over the vocal duties. A more technical and progressive approach, &quot;Testimony of the Ancients&quot; co-defined early progressive death metal alongside &quot;Piece of Time&quot; and &quot;Human&quot; musical and lyrical-wise, with &quot;Land of Tears&quot; getting heavy rotation on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; worldwide. In support of &quot;Testimony of the Ancients&quot;, Pestilence toured with Death again, and also shared dates with Napalm Death, Cannibal Corpse, Entombed and Dismember.

However, Tony Choy was never a permanent member, and ended up going back to Florida to eventually play with Atheist. In the meantime, Pestilence enlisted the talents of Jeroen Paul Thesseling.

Over the years, Pestilence members were getting into other forms of music, primarily jazz fusion. The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Spheres&quot; (1993), was an even more complex affair, mixing jazz elements into their death metal style while also incorporating guitar synths throughout the album.

Pestilence&#x27;s popularity had risen with the release of each album, but unfortunately, so did tensions between the members. After a short period of time, the band unanimously decided to split up, feeling they had reached their creative climax.

===Post-breakup (1995–2007)===
In 1994, Roadrunner released one last CD from Pestilence: a best-of titled &quot;Mind Reflections&quot;, containing tracks from all four albums, plus the rare song &quot;Hatred Within&quot; (originally released on the &quot;Teutonic Invasion Part II&quot; compilation) and six unreleased live tracks recorded at the Dynamo Open Air Festival in 1992. In 1998, Displeased Records re-released the debut album &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (which was originally never officially released in Europe), and included both demo recordings from 1986 and 1987.

In 2006, Metal War Productions, working with Martin van Drunen, released &quot;Chronicles of the Scourge&quot;, containing two concert recordings and one unreleased bonus track. The two concerts are Live &quot;Kix Festival&quot; – Veghel, the Netherlands (24 June 1989) and Live Bochum, Germany (18 November 1988). A bonus &quot;rehearsal disc&quot; was released with the first 1000 copies.

===First reunion (2008–2013)===

After a long period of inactivity the band returned in January 2008, The reunion line-up consisted of Mameli on vocals and guitar, Tony Choy on bass and Peter Wildoer on drums. Speaking to Blabbermouth.net regarding his decision to resurrect the band, Mameli had this to say:
It&#x27;s not a reunion, because I will not be playing with any of the old lineup guys, except Tony Choy, of course so... I always stated there WILL NEVER BE a reunion, and there won&#x27;t be, since I never look back at the past and I refuse now to play with people that are not on the same musical level as I am.

I sang on &quot;Testimony&quot; and &quot;Spheres&quot; (two albums later from &quot;Consuming Impulse&quot;!!), so no need for Martin. This because of the above statement I just made. Furthermore, Martin is doing other things. Good for him.

So now you have two members that were in Pestilence before and one new guy.

The reason why I bring Pestilence back to life is that people/fans keep asking me for this. The time is right now and Mascot is giving me the opportunity to do so.

As you know, I have always been the driving force behind Pestilence, writing all the music and so forth, so that I can state: I will bring back Pestilence to life. More tech and way more brutal than ever before.

In 2008, Pestilence decided to write and record new music for an early 2009 release working with Danish producer Jacob Hansen. Titled &quot;Resurrection Macabre&quot;, it is their first original album in sixteen years (since 1993&#x27;s &quot;Spheres&quot;). In March 2008, Patrick Uterwijk re-joined the band as second-guitarist, however he didn&#x27;t play on &quot;Resurrection Macabre&quot;.

In October 2009, Jeroen Paul Thesseling re-joined Pestilence after fifteen years of separation from the band, replacing Tony Choy&#x27;s bass position. In March 2010, Pestilence announced their first US summer tour in over 16 years which would begin at Maryland Deathfest at Sonar on 30 May. The reformed Pestilence released another album entitled &quot;Doctrine&quot; in April 2011.

On 22 February 2012, Patrick Mameli announced that Jeroen Paul Thesseling and Yuma van Eekelen both left Pestilence, to commit more on their main projects, Thesseling&#x27;s Salazh Trio, and van Eekelen&#x27;s Exivious. Thesseling was replaced by Stephan Fimmers (Necrophagist), and van Eekelen was replaced by Tim Yeung (Morbid Angel, Divine Heresy, All That Remains, Hate Eternal). The new two members were also included in the recording session of the seventh Pestilence album, &quot;Obsideo&quot;.

===Second breakup and reunion (2014–present)===
On 8 July 2014, vocalist/guitarist Patrick Mameli announced that Pestilence was on a &quot;permanent hold&quot;, as he wanted to &quot;concentrate fully&quot; on his new project Neuromorph.

On 4 October 2016, Pestilence announced on their Facebook page that they were once again active, and announced a new lineup, featuring Mameli on both guitar and vocals, Tony Choy on bass (later replaced by Tilen Hudrap), Santiago Dobles on lead guitar and Septimiu Hărşan on drums.

On 22 February 2017, the band announced via their Facebook page that a new album, titled &quot;Hadeon&quot;, was due to be released in 2017. The album&#x27;s release date was later pushed back to 2018, and was finally released on 9 March 2018.

On 24 July 2018, shortly before the bands North America tour was to begin, the metal website MetalSucks reported on a 2017 Facebook post that they alleged showed Patrick Mameli on his personal Facebook profile, in response to a photo of him with blonde dreadlocks, responding to a comment that compared his look to Milli Vanilli with the statement in his native Dutch, &quot;Je zegt dat ik een neger ben?&quot; The site alleged that the use of &quot;neger&quot; translated to the racial epithet nigger. Along with the comment, MetalSucks also alleged that the singer also &quot;propagates Jewish stereotypes&quot;, pointing to his support of United States President Donald Trump moving the nations embassy in Israel. Many commenters on the site pointed out that the website used a Facebook translation on the post that translated it to a-more offensive variant, while Google Translate would return &quot;black&quot; or &quot;negro&quot;. Due to the controversy generated from the article, the band&#x27;s entire U.S. tour was cancelled. In a post on Mameli&#x27;s Facebook page, he stated, &quot;Thanks to metalsucks and their followers, our US minitour has been cancelled by our U.S. promotor[sic].&quot;

On 24 September 2018, Tilen Hudrap announced that he is leaving Pestilence in order to join U.D.O. Edward Negrea of Necrovile was announced as replacement. The band also announced that new music, touring and festival appearances were planned for 2019.

On 1 August 2019, Pestilence announced that they had signed to Agonia Records and would release their then-upcoming ninth studio album &quot;Exitivm&quot; in the coming months. Several months later, Pestilence announced that Septimiu Hărşan had to leave the band due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; he was replaced by Michiel van der Plicht (God Dethroned and Carach Angren). After a two-year delay, &quot;Exitivm&quot; was released on 25 June 2021.

In March 2022, Pestilence announced on their Facebook page that they had finished eight songs for their upcoming tenth studio album &quot;Portals&quot;, with four more tracks to be completed. In July 2023, it was announced that Pestilence had replaced Joost van der Graaf with Roel Käller as their bassist, and were planning to release their new album later in the year or in 2024. However, there were no signs of &quot;Portals&quot;, nor any announcements from the band until September 2024, when it was reported that they were working on the album and that it will be released in 2025.

On February 22, 2024, Pestilence announced they will release &quot;Levels of Perception&quot;, a &quot;best-of&quot; album of re-recorded songs, on April 26. Shortly after the announcement, the original cover art for the album was replaced with a new cover showing the band members, due to backlash from fans over the original cover having been made using artificial intelligence (AI). This was the second controversy centered around one of Pestilence&#x27;s cover artworks, following the original cover art for the band&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Hadeon&quot;, made by Santiago Francisco Jaramillo, which was nixed in 2017 after it was pointed out to have been plagiarized from several different sources.

On January 15, 2025, Pestilence announced that guitarist Rutger van Noordenburg has left the band.

== Style ==
Pestilence&#x27;s approach to death metal is considered to be innovative. The influence of Slayer, Celtic Frost, Venom, and the Possessed has been observed in the band&#x27;s music.

<text>Mercedes-AMG GmbH, commonly known as AMG (Aufrecht, Melcher, Großaspach), is the high-performance subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG. AMG independently hires engineers and contracts with manufacturers to customize Mercedes-Benz AMG vehicles. The company has its headquarters in Affalterbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

AMG was originally an independent engineering firm specializing in performance improvements for Mercedes-Benz vehicles. DaimlerChrysler AG took a controlling interest in 1999, then became the sole owner of AMG in 2005. Mercedes-AMG GmbH is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG, which is in turn owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group.

AMG models typically have more aggressive looks, higher performance, better handling, better stability and more carbon fibre than their regular Mercedes-Benz counterparts. AMG models are typically the most expensive and highest-performing variant of each Mercedes-Benz class. AMG has also made special variants of some Mitsubishi and Honda models.

AMG variants are usually badged with two numerals, as opposed to regular Mercedes-Benz vehicles, which have three (e.g. &quot;E 63&quot; as opposed to &quot;E 350&quot;). The numerals do not always indicate engine size, but are rather a tribute to earlier heritage cars, such as the 300 SEL 6.3 litre. For example, newer-model AMG V8s such as the E 63 actually have 4.0L V8s.

The world&#x27;s first stand-alone Mercedes-AMG dealership, AMG Sydney, was opened in Sydney, Australia in 2018.

==History==

AMG was established in 1967 as a racing engine manufacturer under the name &quot;AMG Motorenbau- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH&quot; (translated from German as &quot;AMG Engine Production and Development Limited&quot;) by former Mercedes-Benz engineers Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher in Burgstall an der Murr, near Stuttgart. The name &quot;AMG&quot; is derived from the initials of Aufrecht, Melcher, and Großaspach (Aufrecht&#x27;s birthplace). In 1976, the majority of AMG&#x27;s operations moved to Affalterbach, with racing-engine development remaining in Burgstall. At this time, Erhard Melcher ceased his partnership but continued working at the Burgstall location.

By 1993, AMG became a high-profile purveyor of modified Mercedes-Benz vehicles. That year, Daimler-Benz AG and AMG entered into a cooperation agreement, enabling AMG to use Daimler-Benz&#x27;s dealer network and to develop joint vehicles, the first being the Mercedes-Benz C36 AMG.

On 1 January 1999, DaimlerChrysler AG (as it was called between 1998 and 2007) acquired 51 percent of AMG shares, and the company was renamed Mercedes-AMG GmbH. The racing engine division was separated and continues to operate in Burgstall under the name HWA, derived from Aufrecht&#x27;s initials. On 1 January 2005, Aufrecht sold his remaining shares to DaimlerChrysler, and since then, Mercedes-AMG GmbH has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mercedes-Benz Group.

===Development of the product range===

AMG started off by designing and testing racing engines. It expanded its business into building &quot;custom&quot; road cars based upon standard Mercedes cars. AMG initially produced a range of unofficial upgrade and accessories packages mainly for the Mercedes-Benz R107 and C107 (1971–1989 SL roadster), Mercedes-Benz W116 (1972–1980 S-class), Mercedes-Benz W123 (1976–1985 E-class predecessor), Mercedes-Benz W124 (1984–1997 E-class), Mercedes-Benz W126 (1979–1992 S-class), Mercedes-Benz R129 (1989–2001 SL roadster), and Mercedes-Benz W201 (1990–1993 C-class) models.

During the early 1980s and up until 1990, AMG offered a variety of engine performance packages, alloy wheels and styling products as an entirely independent company from Daimler-Benz. In 1990, AMG signed a co-operation agreement with Daimler-Benz, and AMG options and cars were then offered in Mercedes-Benz showrooms; in 1999 Daimler AG, then known as DaimlerChrysler AG, bought the controlling share of AMG and made them part of the official Mercedes-Benz line-up.

Typical AMG performance enhancements, which the buyer could custom order, included increased engine displacements (5.2 litre, 5.4 litre), performance top ends with port and polished heads and intake, lightened valve train, and more aggressive cams. The DOHC 32V engine had also just been developed and was the pinnacle of AMG performance. A Getrag five-speed manual transmission could be ordered from AMG, and Mercedes had not offered a manual transmission V8 since the early 1970s.

The performance wheels offered during the same period were 15-inch or 16-inch ATS AMG Five Spoke Road Wheels, typically coupled with an AMG performance suspension package that included uprated and lowered springs, and re-valved shock absorbers.

Also popular were AMG body kits. These ranged from subtle front spoilers to aggressive Wide Body kits for the W126 coupes (reaching more than $700k on the classic market in 2022). Other options included Recaro seats, smaller diameter steering wheels, instrument clusters, chrome delete option (all brightworks colour-coded or painted satin black), refrigerators, shift knobs, hi-fi stereo systems, custom upholstery and enhanced interior wood packages.

An AMG-modified W124 E-Class was claimed to be the world&#x27;s fastest passenger sedan in 1986. Nicknamed the Hammer, it featured an AMG-tuned 5.6-litre DOHC Mercedes-Benz V8 in a midsized sedan. Advanced for its time for a street engine, it had four valves per cylinder and was claimed to push the car faster than a Lamborghini Countach from 60 to 120 mph. Later models were even more powerful and introduced the 17-inch AMG Aero 1 Hammer wheels. 

Through the early 2000s, AMG focused principally on supercharged V8 and V6 engines, but the company officially abandoned this technology in 2006 with the introduction of the naturally aspirated 6.2 L M156 V8. On 16 January 2006, Mercedes-AMG Chairman Volker Mornhinweg told AutoWeek that the company would use turbocharging for higher output rather than supercharging. For 2011, AMG released the M157 5.5L bi-turbo V8, which has supplanted the M156 in its full-sized cars such as the S-Class and CL-Class (and is trickling down to the CLS, E-Class, and ML-class). In 2012, Mercedes-AMG Chairman Olla Kallenius said that Mercedes-AMG will not produce diesel engines to compete with BMW&#x27;s tri-turbo diesels (BMW M Performance range).
Although there were some AMG models in the 1980s with manual transmissions, almost all recent models have used automatics (5G-Tronic, 7G-Tronic and later 9G-Tronic with Speedshift), in contrast to &quot;BMW M&quot;, which used manual and recently automatic transmissions (the current type being a dual clutch transmission).

Although these are considered the most well known in-house tuning divisions, Mercedes-AMG has a considerably different philosophy than BMW M. Compared to BMW M, Mercedes-AMG is &quot;less narrow in its sporting focus, yet still combining sledgehammer performance with relaxed handling, cultured comfort, and practicality&quot;.

While founders Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher had emphasized proper racing cars, Mercedes-AMG had diverged considerably from this philosophy in recent years, with their offerings being well known for straight-line acceleration but poor handling dynamics. However, current Mercedes-AMG chairman Volker Mornhinweg has urged the division to return to its roots of building sports cars.

===Motor racing===

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, AMG entered the big Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3 V8 saloon, affectionately named the &quot;Red Sow&quot;, in the 1971 Spa 24 Hours, and the European Touring Car Championship. AMG and Mercedes worked together on Mercedes-Benz W201 cars for the 1988 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM, German Touring Car Championship). AMG was made the official partner.

When DaimlerChrysler acquired a majority share of AMG in 1999, the motor racing department was divested into HWA AG. Their first car was the ill-fated Mercedes-Benz CLR. Since 2000, HWA builds and runs the cars for Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), as well as the M271 engine tuned for use in Formula 3.

In 2000, an extensively modified one-off Mercedes-Benz AMG CLK 55 was built by the AMG Factory as a purpose-built race car to compete in the 2001 Targa Tasmania 7 day road race. Mick Doohan was the works Mercedes-Benz AMG driver.

Six successive lightly modified Mercedes-Benz AMG models (including, most recently, a C190 GT Black Series) have acted as the safety cars for the FIA Formula One World Championship.

Since 2010, the SLS AMG GT3 and the AMG GT3 have been competing in GT competitions around the world, such as the FIA GT3 European Championship, Blancpain Endurance Series, Blancpain Sprint Series, VLN, 24 Hours of Nürburgring, British GT Championship, Super GT, Australian GT Championship, Bathurst 12 Hour, Dubai 24 Hour, Macau GT Cup and Pirelli World Challenge.

In late 2011, after the end of the Formula One season, Mercedes GP Petronas announced that it would be using the AMG branding for its F1 efforts, changing its name to Mercedes AMG Petronas from the 2012 season onwards.

Three AMG E-Class V8 Supercars competed in the Australian Supercars Championship from 2013 to 2015, operated by Erebus Motorsport under the AMG Customer Sports Program.

AMG also provides engines for Pagani&#x27;s Zonda, Huayra and Utopia cars. The M297 7,291 cc displacement V12 engines were originally used in the 1998 Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR Straßenversion and made later available for the Zonda. It was the largest displacement naturally aspirated engine provided by AMG.

===Relationship with Aston Martin===
On 25 July 2013, Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd and Daimler AG announced moves towards a technical partnership with Mercedes-AMG GmbH. The deal will see Aston Martin access significant Mercedes-AMG GmbH and Mercedes-Benz Cars&#x27; resources, allowing the development of bespoke V8 powertrains and the use of certain components of electric/electronic architecture. Daimler AG now owns a stake of 5% of non-voting shares in Aston Martin, joining existing shareholders Investment DAR, Adeem Investment and Investindustrial. The technical partnership will support Aston Martin&#x27;s launch of a new generation of models and newly developed bespoke V8 powertrains.

Since the 2021 Formula One World Championship, the German marque shares the role as the official Safety Car supplier with Aston Martin.

===Relationship with Lotus===
AMG also provides engines for the Lotus Emira. The M139 I4 engine was originally used in the CLA 45 AMG.

==AMG trim==
Mercedes-Benz allows customers to upgrade nearly any model by adding an AMG trim or styling package. So customers can customize Mercedes cars to look like an AMG car, minus the AMG engine and transmission. AMG trim can include things such as a rear spoiler, body styling, deep front air dam, AMG style wheels, sport front seats, sport steering wheel, AMG floor mats, sport suspension, sport brakes, and more.

==Current AMG models==

All AMG engines – with the exception of the &quot;35&quot;, &quot;43&quot; and &quot;53&quot; models, as well as the PU106B 1.6 L V6 E-Turbo Hybrid F1 engine used on the AMG One – are hand built using a &quot;one man, one engine&quot; philosophy at the current AMG plant in Affalterbach, Germany. To signify this, each AMG engine builder stamps the engines they produce with an engraved plaque depicting their signature. According to Mercedes-Benz, there are only about 50 AMG engine builders.

As part of the official Mercedes product line, the AMG models are sold side by side with regular production models, unlike those offered by other Mercedes tuning firms such as Brabus.

==Previous AMG models==

===&quot;65&quot; M275 6.0 L V12 Bi-Turbo===

The models listed below were powered by a variant of the Mercedes-Benz M275 engine.
* 2004–2013 S65 AMG
* 2004–2014 CL65 AMG
* 2004–2011 SL65 AMG
* 2012–2018 G65 AMG
* 2012–2018 Mercedes-AMG SL 65
* 2014–2019 Mercedes-AMG S 65
This AMG powerplant had an all-new design of the bi-turbo system, which features larger turbochargers and a new, more powerful charge-air cooling system, and the increase in the engine displacement (to 5980 cc) as well as many other engine design measures. This allows it to produce a claimed 621 horsepower and of torque.

&quot;65&quot; models used a 5-speed automatic transmission for a long time, as the newer 7G-Tronic wasn&#x27;t able to handle the torque from the V12 engines. This was changed with the introduction of 2012 SL 65 AMG, which uses the same AMG SpeedShift MCT transmission as the rest of the AMG line-up.

Coinciding with the facelift of the CL-Class for the 2011 model year, the 2011 CL 65 AMG had an enhanced engine. AMG redesigned the exhaust gas turbochargers and added new engine electronics. It produced 621 horsepower, pushing the car from in 4.2 seconds (0.2 seconds faster than the 2011 CL 63), with an electronically limited top speed of . The update also improved fuel economy and reduced carbon emissions by 3.5% over the outgoing model.

===&quot;63&quot; M157 5.5 L V8 Bi-Turbo===
The models listed below were powered by the M157 variant of the Mercedes-Benz M278 engine.
* Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 (W219)
* Mercedes-AMG E 63 (W212)
* Mercedes-AMG G 63 (W463)
* Mercedes-AMG GL 63 (X166 pre-facelift)
* Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 (W166 facelift)
* Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 (X166 facelift)
* Mercedes-AMG M 63 (W166 pre-facelift)
* Mercedes-AMG S 63 (W222 pre-facelift)
* Mercedes-AMG SL 63 (R231)

Rumoured in 2009 and confirmed in 2010, AMG developed the M157, a 5.5-litre V8 with direct fuel injection and twin turbochargers. Power is rated at up to at 5,250-5,750rpm with a peak torque of made between 2,000rpm and 4,500 rpm (the amount of power and torque depends on model, but these are the maximum ratings). Both engines are mated to Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s 7-speed MCT transmission.
Unlike the M156 naturally aspirated 6.2 L V8, which was developed entirely within AMG, the M157 is based upon the M278 used in the regular Mercedes-Benz S-Class and CL-Class. The M157 boasts 25% better fuel economy (10.5 litres per 100 kilometres versus 14.4 L/100 km in the European driving cycle) over the M156, meaning it avoids the US Gas Guzzler Tax for the first time ever, despite having up to 47 horsepower more. The M157&#x27;s increased torque from both the regular version and performance package means the engine can be shifted into a taller gear sooner, keeping engine revs and fuel consumption to a minimum. The new M157 has an engine start/stop mode and is lightweight at 204 kg. The M157 is said to be ideal for powering full-size sedans such as the S-Class, but the older M156 remains in production, as its more precise throttle response is still well suited to smaller sportier models (the C-Class), until the 2015 model arrives, which is powered by a 4.0 liter V8.

5.5 L V8 BiTurbo models carry the &quot;63&quot; model designation, shared with the 6.2L V8 models. Visually, the 2011 S 63 AMG is differentiated from the 2010 model (itself face-lifted over the 2009 S 63) by the more angular design of the chromed dual exhaust tips, which also sport embossed AMG logos, as well as new forged wheels. For the CL 63 AMG, the new M157 engine coincides with the facelift of the CL-Class for the 2011 model year.

Despite common belief, 63 AMG models are typically faster than their 65 AMG counterparts. An S 63 AMG accelerates faster and handles better than an S 65 AMG (due to 4-wheel drive and decreased weight), and an SL 63 AMG accelerates faster than an SL 65 AMG due to decreased torque, lower weight, and better balance by use of the V8.

Since 2013, AMG models with the S-Model package feature all-wheel drive, which allows for better handling and better acceleration. The Mercedes-Benz CLS 63 AMG S has been tested to accelerate to 60 mph in just 3.2 seconds, with a quarter mile time of 11.6 seconds. This made it the quickest production sedan at the time. MotorTrend tested the 2014 E 63 AMG S with the M157 engine to produce an estimated and .

===&quot;63&quot; M156/M159 6.2 L V8===

* 2008-2015 C63 AMG, C63 AMG Black Series, Edition 507 (Sedan and Wagon) (facelifted for the 2012 model year)
* Mercedes E63 AMG (W211, 2009-2011, Sedan and Wagon)

* Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG (2009–2012)

AMG developed its own V8 engine (dubbed M156 in development) for the DTM series. The M156, in various states of tune, was used in models such as the SL 63, E 63, CLS 63, and S 63 until it was replaced by the M157 5.5 L Biturbo V8. This naturally aspirated V8 replaced most of the &quot;55&quot; models. The &quot;published&quot; output according to Mercedes varies from on the C 63 AMG, to on the C/CLK/R/ML/GL/S/SL/CL/E 63 AMG.

The 2008 S 63/CL 63/SL 63s that used the M156 engine at 518 horsepower edged out that of the S600/CL600/SL600, the latter powered by the 510 horsepower 5.5-liter twin-turbo V12, while also having a higher redline. However, the S600/CL600/SL600 is more expensive and has more torque at . The S 63/CL 63/SL 63, however, do have quicker acceleration times than their S600/CL600/SL600 counterparts and are the fastest in the lineup in 2014, due to the added weight and torque of the 65s, thus decreasing the 0-60 times and the handling limits.

Compared to the &quot;55&quot; supercharged 5.4 L V8 engine—which was restricted to the Speedshift 5G-Tronic five-speed automatic transmission, as it had a torque capacity of —the reduced torque of the &quot;63&quot; M156 6.2L V8 means it can be mated with the more efficient 7G-Tronic, which can withstand a limit of . Despite the reduction in torque, the increased horsepower and more efficient transmission enable the &quot;63&quot; models to match or surpass the acceleration of the &quot;55&quot; models. Most of the M156-engined models used the 7G-Tronic automatic transmission, however the more recent 2009 SL 63, 2010 E 63, and 2012 C 63 use the 7-speed MCT transmission.

In 2009, AMG developed the M159 engine, which is based on the M156 engine, to use in SLS AMG. The M159 produces 583 horsepower and 489 lb-ft of torque in the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT, and 622 horsepower and 468 lb-ft in the SLS AMG Black Series.

===&quot;55&quot; M152 5.5 L V8===
* AMG SLK 55
The M152 is a naturally aspirated, detuned version of the M157 Biturbo V8. This V8 will be used for the 2012 SLK 55 AMG, and it produces 415 hp and 398 lb-ft. This engine was discontinued in 2016 with the release of the SLC 43 AMG.

* Mercedes-AMG GLA 45
* Mercedes-AMG A 45
* Mercedes-AMG CLA 45
The 2.0 L Turbo I4 was created for use in the smaller, 45 AMG models, such as the A-Class, CLA-Class, and GLA-Class, which all share the same platform. The M133 (2015 onwards) produces and , which made it the most powerful turbo 4-cylinder in production at the time, and with a 190.5-horsepower per liter, one of the most power dense engines in production. Models with the M133 Turbo 4 are paired with a 7-speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT Dual-Clutch Transmission. The CLA45 AMG can accelerate from in 4.2 seconds, according to Motor Trend&#x27;s first test of the vehicle.

===&quot;32&quot; 3.2 L V6 Kompressor===

Powertrain consists of AMG Speedshift 5-speed automatic transmission mated to an AMG 3.2-litre V6 Kompressor engine with an output of 260 kW/349 hp and at 4,400 rpm. The engine is a special version of the 3.2 L (3199 cc) M112 E32, fitted with a helical twin-screw supercharger and water-to-air intercooler. The supercharger was developed in conjunction with IHI and features Teflon-coated rotors producing overall boost of 14.5 psi (1 bar). Compared to the standard M112 engine, the AMG version also has a new crankshaft, new connecting rods and pistons, an oil pump with a 70-percent increased capacity, lightweight camshafts, and harder valve springs for a redline of 6200 rpm, an increase of 200 rpm.

While rival BMW M developed the &quot;SMG-II&quot; automated manual for the BMW M3, the C 32 and SLK 32 have a 5-speed automatic transmission&#x27;s &quot;Speedshift&quot; system, which now has quicker response (up to 35 percent) to accelerator and shift selector movements.

The C 32 had a smaller engine than its predecessors, the C 36 AMG with the M104 3.6L I6 engine, and the C 43 AMG powered by the M113 4.3L V8 engine. The C 32 AMG can do 0– in 5.2sec 0–100 in 12.6 with a 1/4 mile of 13.6 at 106 mph (C&amp;D comparison test May 2003).

===&quot;55&quot; M113K 5.4L V8 Kompressor===

This model was nicknamed the &quot;Hammer&quot; after the original 1986 AMG Hammer (a W124 E-Class sedan with an AMG-tuned 360 hp 5.6-litre V8). The 2003 E 55 AMG could do 0– in 4.4 seconds.

The main engine is a 5.4 L V8 engine This engine comes in two configurations.
* The first configuration is a naturally aspirated V8 with that is used in the C 55 AMG, CLK 55 AMG, E 55 AMG (1999-2002), SLK 55 AMG, and ML 55 AMG. The C 43 AMG (model years 1998–2000) was powered by a naturally aspirated V8 engine from the M113 family, but at a reduced displacement of 4.3L, hence the &#x27;43&#x27; designation.
* The other configuration is a similar unit but with a highly efficient Lysholm type twin screw supercharger, as manufactured by Eaton. This supercharger is found in the rest of the AMG 55 models, which are typically midsized or larger vehicles. According to Mercedes, the &quot;published&quot; output varies from to and to , depending on various methods of power measurements and different ECU programming, in accordance with nation-specific requirements. For instance, the E 55 AMG&#x27;s engine was at the low end, yet nonetheless it was still Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s fastest sedan at the time, while the SL55 AMG&#x27;s engine had the top output. Mercedes has claimed that a more restrictive exhaust system was responsible for cutting output on the E 55 AMG, however some enthusiasts have managed to bump up horsepower to 505 on the E 55 by incorporating some parts from the SL 55.

The supercharged 5.4 L 24 valve V8 engine was mated to the Speedshift 5-speed automatic transmission, which has a torque capacity of , as the newer 7G-Tronic introduced in 2003 is limited to , which is not enough to handle the torque from the supercharged V8.

The V8 S 55 AMG had an output comparable to the V12-powered S600 throughout its production. The S 55 AMG (2001–02) was outfitted with a 5.4 L V8 engine while the later versions (2003–06) sported the same motor, but supercharged to a rated . The S600 (2001–02) was outfitted with a 5.8L V12 engine while the later versions (2003–06) sported a twin-turbocharged (or Bi-Turbo) 5.5L V12. The justification for having two models with the same power is that the S 55 AMG is sportier and more responsive, while the costlier S600 is more luxurious with a smoother ride.

AMG phased out both the naturally aspirated and supercharged 5.4 L engines in favor of the new M156 V8 beginning in 2006, which was paired with 7G-Tronic. However, some enthusiasts were disappointed because the naturally aspirated M156 produces less torque than the supercharged M113K.

For the Model Year 2009:
* M113 5.4 L &quot;55&quot; V8 models (naturally aspirated)
**SLK 55 AMG
* M113 5.4 L &quot;55&quot; V8 models (supercharged)
**G 55 AMG

===&quot;63&quot; M137 6.3 L V12===
The &quot;63&quot; badging was used on the short-lived 2001 S 63 AMG, 2001 CL 63 AMG and 2002 G 63 AMG. These were produced in limited quantities for one month and only offered through AMG to select customers in Europe and Asia, purportedly state leaders. The CL 63 AMG was the rarest C215 CL of all, and just 26 examples were built in November 2001 (51 plate), with some UK being and one for France registered in March 2002. These had a base price of £110,000 (~US$200,000). The G 63 AMG was the rarest W463 of all with just 5 examples built in September 2002 and sold in Germany at over €250,000 each.

These are powered by a naturally aspirated 6.3L V12 producing . This engine is based on the M137 5.8L V12 used in the S 600 and CL 600, but the AMG variants have a larger displacement, a new management system, a new crank case and cooling system, weight-optimized pistons, and a new camshaft with greater valve lift and modified valves. of torque are available between 2500 and 5800 rpm with a peak of at 4400 rpm while horsepower grows by almost 80 over the 5.8L V12. It is mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2001 S 63 AMG V12 had 100 hp more than the 2001 S 55 AMG, and was a few tenths faster.

===&quot;60&quot;, &quot;73&quot;, &quot;70&quot;, &quot;55&quot;===
The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class (R129) had several AMG variants during its production run from 1989 to 2001.

The SL 60 AMG was the most numerous of these rare cars. Sold from 1993 to 1998, it used a 6.0 litre V8 engine producing at 5500 rpm. AMG claimed a 0– speed of 5.6 seconds. Its top speed was limited to , but with the limiter removed, it was capable of approximately . AMG later unofficially conceded that was more like 5.0 seconds and the engine produced between 405 and 410 bhp.

Extremely rare was the SL 73 AMG, sold through Mercedes-AMG in 1995, and offering the most powerful V12 engine ever put into an SL up to that time. After a brief hiatus, the SL 73 was offered again from 1998 to 2001. The same 7.3 L V12 was later used by Pagani in the Zonda.

Even rarer is the SL 70 AMG (7.0 L (7055 cc) V12 engine).

The SL 55 AMG was sold in the R129 body style from 1998 to 2001 in limited numbers (5.4L V8, at 5500 rpm). It was the predecessor of the production R230 SL 55 AMG sold later, albeit was normally aspirated in the R129 and not supercharged as in its R230 successor.

===Electric Drive===
In 2013, Mercedes-AMG announced the SLS AMG Coupe Electric Drive, which was to be the first zero emissions vehicle from AMG. The vehicle used technology derived from Formula 1, and was the fastest electric car. The SLS AMG Electric Drive has 740 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque, and Mercedes-AMG claims a time of 3.9 seconds.

==Black Series models==

AMG Black Series models are exclusive flagship models with the maximum in performance technology for AMG road cars. The AMG Performance Studio in Affalterbach is responsible for the upgrades that make an AMG into an AMG Black Series model. The Black Series treatment is only available on 2 door vehicles, which includes weight reduction, bucket seats, exterior alterations, interior alterations, higher power, greater traction, handling, and significantly greater overall performance. Black Series models are known as street-legal race cars.
* SLK 55 AMG Black Series
* CLK 63 AMG Black Series
* SL 65 AMG Black Series
* C 63 AMG Black Series
* SLS AMG Black Series
* AMG GT Black Series
The SLS AMG Black Series was tested by Motor Trend to have a 0-60 mph time of 3.2 seconds, and a quarter mile time of 11.1 seconds at 129.8 mph. The SLS AMG Black Series &quot;demolished&quot; the Motor Trend figure eight in just 23.1 seconds, beating the McLaren MP4-12C, Ferrari 458 Italia, Audi R8 V10 Plus, and the SRT Viper. The SLS AMG Black Series had the same 1:19 time as the Lamborghini Murciélago LP670-4 SuperVeloce, the Ferrari Enzo, and beat the Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4, Porsche 997 GT2, and Nissan GT-R around the Top Gear test track.

As of July 2024, the AMG GT Black Series is the second fastest sports car in Nürburgring Nordschleife, behind the Porsche 991 GT2 RS Manthey Performance Kit.

==Non-Mercedes AMG models==
AMG is primarily associated with Mercedes-Benz, having been fully owned by the company since 2005, but it has also produced special variants of some Mitsubishi and Honda models.

===Mitsubishi AMG models===

AMG&#x27;s relationship with Mitsubishi began in 1987 with an enhanced version of the second-generation Debonair, known as the Mitsubishi Debonair V3000 Royal AMG. This model did not feature performance upgrades but included a body kit, wheels, steering wheel, and AMG badges. A long-wheelbase version was later introduced.

In 1989, the Mitsubishi Galant AMG was launched, with about 500 units produced for the Japanese domestic market until 1991. The vehicle was equipped with an AMG-tuned Mitsubishi 4G63 engine producing and featured a body kit, alloy wheels, and a full leather interior.

===Honda AMG models===
During the 1980s and 1990s, AMG developed sports variants of the Honda Ballade in South Africa. These models, known as Honda Ballade AMGs, were based on the fourth- and fifth-generation Honda Civics. They were equipped with lower Eibach springs, 15- or 16-inch Remotec aluminium wheels, and larger rear spoilers. The 180i models were powered by 1.8-litre Honda B18B4 engines, potentially tuned to , while 160i versions with 1.6-litre engines were also available.

The partnership between Mercedes-Benz and Honda in South Africa was driven by Mercedes&#x27; desire to expand its local lineup with more affordable models, while Honda sought to enter the South African market. Due to Mercedes&#x27; reluctance to invest in an entry-level model and Honda&#x27;s lack of infrastructure and brand recognition in the country, a deal was made where Mercedes-Benz South Africa would build and sell Honda models. The South African Honda Ballades were essentially rebadged Honda Civics, featuring additional luxury equipment and positioned below models such as the Mercedes 190.

<text>Tettenhall is a historic village within the City of Wolverhampton, in the county of the West Midlands, England. Tettenhall became part of Wolverhampton district in 1966, along with Bilston, Wednesfield and parts of Willenhall, Coseley and Sedgley.

==History==
Tettenhall&#x27;s name derives from the Old English &quot;Teottanhalh&quot;, meaning &quot;nook of land belonging to a man named Teotta&quot;. The original &quot;halh&quot; was likely situated in the sheltered area below the ridge where the church stands. This area, around Lower Green, was the original inhabited area of Tettenhall. In early English (Anglo-Saxon) times, as the place name evidence tells us, there were many cleared woodland areas – areas where field and settlement would have been commonplace. These can be seen today by the place name ending &quot;ley&quot;, from early English &quot;lēah&quot;, meaning woodland clearing; Wrottesley being one such example in the local area. Where most of the land was wooded, below the ridge ran, as it does today, the river Smestow - though at this time, it was a larger stream than it is today, running through extensive marshy ground.

The Battle of Tettenhall in 910 was the turning point in the battle against the Danish Viking invaders by the united forces of Edward the Elder of Wessex and Ealdorman Æthelred of Mercia. It saw the crushing defeat of the last of the large Danish Viking armies to ravage England, including the deaths of the Danish Kings, Eowils and Healfdan. In more recent times, the north part of the village became known as &quot;Danescourt&quot;.

Tettenhall has an old parish church, &quot;St Michael and All Angels&quot;, located at the base of the ridge, leading off Lower Green. An exact founding date for it is not known, though records of a fourteenth-century dispute over village land tell us that the church had been founded during the reign of King Edgar, at some point between 959 and 975 AD. The Domesday Book of 1086 informs us that before the Norman conquest, Tettenhall was held by three Englishmen – Hunta, Wulfstan, and Godwin. Of course, as with the majority of England, post-conquest, William the Conqueror gave the land to his followers.

There is a variety of pear known as &#x27;Tettenhall Dick&#x27;, named after Tettenhall, originally found in the hamlet of Perton and dating to earlier than the 18th century. These small, dry pears are traditionally used for the making of perry. The Bees &amp; Trees charity began a scheme to plant 2,000 Tettenhall Dick trees across the Midlands in a bid to save them, as very few of them existed any more. These trees were grafted from existing Tettenhall Dick trees, and the scheme has proven to be a success, with trees being planted in a variety of different locations. The variety is now part of the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale in Kent.

The original route of the London to Holyhead road ran through Tettenhall, though on a different course from the current A41 Tettenhall Road. The road, when heading north east from Wolverhampton, ran behind the shops at Newbridge, on bridges over the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal (when built in 1772) and the river Smestow, then across to Old Hill, where a steep climb was had for any carriages on route. The road then cut across Upper Green, swayed left into Wrottesley Road as far as Woodthorne Road, and then continuing on as the present Wergs Road. This route, because of the problems associated with carriages traversing the steep Old Hill, was looked at in the early 19th century by the Wolverhampton Trust and Thomas Telford, with a view to engineering a new route – either around, under, or through the ridge. Due to a dispute, Thomas Telford dropped out of the plans, leaving the Wolverhampton Trust to go it alone. The preferred method was a cutting through the ridge, with the course of the road sloping up on a gradual gradient from near the Newbridge area, cutting through and rising above Lower Green, before the direct cutting through the ridge to come out next to Upper Green. The spoil from the cutting through the ridge is what was used to create the incline of the road. Work was completed in 1823.

==Village greens==
Tettenhall is one of the few places in England to have two village greens. Tettenhall Upper Green is situated on high ground near the edge of a ridge that runs in a broadly east–west direction, from Aldersley to Perton. The Upper Green has a large paddling pool, an extensive open grass area, a cricket pitch, practice nets and the Wolverhampton Cricket Club Ground, where W. G. Grace visited and played. The area is common land that was donated by the Swindley family to the people of the parish. A clock tower, built in 1912 by the local Swindley family and donated to the parish to celebrate the coronation of King George V, is a key landmark in Upper Green.

Tettenhall Lower Green is at the bottom of The Rock, near St. Michael and All Angels Church. It is a sloping grassy area that is popular for sledging on snowy winter days.

The A41 road runs through the village green as a single-carriageway road. Despite the relatively close proximity to Wolverhampton&#x27;s city centre, Tettenhall retains its rural village character and a strong sense of identity among its residents.

== Governance ==
Tettenhall became an urban district in 1894, the district only contained the civil parish of Tettenhall. On 1 April 1966 the district was abolished and merged with the County Borough of Wolverhampton and Seisdon Rural District. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with Wolverhampton, Codsall, Lower Penn and Wrottesley. In 1961 the parish had a population of 14,867.

The village has tried to gain independence from Wolverhampton Council and has made plans to return to a parish council but this has no longer been pursued.

Two electoral wards of Wolverhampton City Council cover Tettenhall; Tettenhall Regis (the northern part) and Tettenhall Wightwick (the southern part).

==Notable people==
*Francis Smith of Warwick (1672–1738), the architect, was son of Francis Smith of The Wergs near Tettenhall. (He became identified with Warwick through setting up business in that town, which he helped rebuild after the Great Fire of Warwick in 1694.)
*Button Gwinnett (1735–1777) who later emigrated to America where he became the second signer of the United States Declaration of Independence had two daughters who were buried in St Michael&#x27;s churchyard in 1759 and 1762.
*Billy Harrison (1886–1948), professional footballer mainly for Wolverhampton Wanderers, ran a pub in the village after retiring from playing.
*Married former Olympic competitors Hugh Porter (1940–), professional track cyclist and commentator, and his wife Anita Lonsbrough (1941–), swimmer, live in Tettenhall.
*Children&#x27;s television presenter Mark Speight (1965–2008), was from Tettenhall. His ashes are interred in the parish churchyard.

==Education==

Tettenhall College is a private school based in Tettenhall Towers, the former home of the Thorneycroft family.

St Regis Church of England Academy is a Church of England school for 11- to 19-year-olds. As part of the BSF programme, the school was refurbished and now incorporates Tettenhall Wood Special School onto its site.

Christ Church Infants and Juniors are linked to the church of the same name, situated in Tettenhall Wood.

St Michael&#x27;s CofE School and Woodthorne Primary School are also located here.

==Transport==
Tettenhall has strong connections to Wolverhampton and Dudley with bus service 1 running every 9 minutes in the week and a 20-minute frequency on evenings and Sundays. Service 1 is operated by National Express West Midlands and also Let&#x27;s Go. There are also buses to Compton (10/10A) and Telford (891).

Tettenhall used to be served by three railway stations on the former Wombourne Branch Line, namely Dunstall Park, Tettenhall and Compton Halt but today the nearest railway stations to the village are Wolverhampton and Bilbrook. Since 2019 proposals have been made to open a new station on the edge of Tettenhall on the Wolverhampton–Shrewsbury line.

The Tettenhall Transport Heritage Centre is the first transport museum in the City of Wolverhampton and is found in Tettenhall.

<text>A commercial pilot licence (CPL) is a type of pilot licence that permits the holder to act as a pilot of an aircraft and be paid for their work. 

Different licenses are issued for the major aircraft categories: airplanes, airships, balloons, gliders, gyroplanes and helicopters. Depending on the jurisdiction these may all be on the same document.

A CPL will typically have no expiry date. However, a valid type rating or class rating will be required to use it, as well as a valid medical certificate. A pilot&#x27;s ratings may be listed on the licence, including the types of aircraft that can be flown (single-engine or multiengine), whether flight under instrument flight rules is allowed (instrument rating), and whether instructing and examining of trainee pilots can be done (instructor or examiner rating).

==Requirements==

The basic requirements to obtain the license and the privileges it confers are agreed internationally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However the actual implementation varies quite widely from country to country. According to ICAO, to be eligible for a commercial pilot license, the applicant must;
* be able to read, speak, write, and understand English
* already hold a private pilot licence
* have received training in the areas of a commercial pilot
* successfully complete the relevant written exams.

In most European countries, aviation regulations are set by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The requirements and privileges of a CPL are specified in EASA Part-FCL. Applicants for a CPL (aeroplanes) must have completed a solo cross-country flight of at least 300 nm with full-stop landings at two airfields other than the pilot&#x27;s airfield of origin.

In the United Kingdom, a pilot must have flown 200 hours for the issue of a CPL, including 100 hours as pilot in command. They must have completed a qualifying cross-country flight of at least 300 nautical miles as pilot in command, including full stop landings at two aerodromes different from the departure aerodrome.

In Canada, a pilot must be at least 18 years old, and must hold a Category 1 Medical Certificate. They must complete at least 80 hours of classroom instruction on a variety of topics, and pass a written exam with a score of at least 60%. They must also have logged at least 200 hours of flying experience. The experience must include 100 hours as the pilot in command, as well as specific experience at night, flying cross-country, and instrument time.

<doc id="854899" wikidata="Q6830549" url="?curid=854899" title="Michael Gawenda">
<text>Michael Gawenda (born 1947) is an Australian journalist and was editor of &quot;The Age&quot; from 1997 to 2004. He was appointed inaugural Director of the Centre for Advanced Journalism at the University of Melbourne, launched in 2008. The centre&#x27;s mission is to improve the practice of journalism through dialogue between journalists and the general community to stimulate public debate on important issues facing journalism.

==Life as a refugee==
Gawenda was born 1947 in a refugee camp in Austria. His family moved to Melbourne, Australia, in 1949. Gawenda attended Caulfield North state school. He studied economics and politics at Monash University.

==Career==
He started his career in 1970, joining &quot;The Age&quot; as a cadet journalist. In 1997 he became an editor and in 2003 the editor-in-chief. Before that, was a senior editor with &quot;TIME&quot;. During 2002 he became the subject of controversy when, as editor-in-chief, he rejected a Michael Leunig cartoon which juxtaposed an image of a Jew standing at the gates of Auschwitz with an image of a Jew with a gun standing at the border between Israel and Palestine. Leunig subsequently claimed that Gawenda did not understand the point he was making. Gawenda said &quot;I think it&#x27;s just inappropriate. Anyone seeing that cartoon would think it inappropriate.&quot;

==Writing==
===&quot;American Notebook&quot;===
On 15 April 2004, Gawenda announced that he would return to reporting as &quot;The Age&quot;&#x27;s Washington correspondent.

Gawenda&#x27;s final article from Washington was published on 28 May 2007 when he announced he will be returning to Australia and would no longer be writing for &quot;The Age&quot;. This led to the publication in August 2007 of a book, &quot;American Notebook&quot;, sub-titled &quot;A Personal and Political Journey&quot;, about American politics.

===&quot;Rocky and Gawenda&quot;===
Gawenda&#x27;s canine companion inspired him to join the blog revolution to escape from the stresses and frustration of journalism. The blog ran on the &quot;Crikey&quot; website from February to November 2009. The posts from February to June were collected in a volume titled &quot;Rocky &amp; Gawenda&quot;. The book, published by Melbourne University Press, is composed of short essays, observations and recollections, mostly reflecting on aspects of his own life: family, especially his two children; dogs; blogging; the pleasure he finds in food; friends and funerals.

===&quot;Leo Meo&quot;===
The birth of his first grandchild inspired Gawenda to write a poem every two weeks for the first year of Leo&#x27;s life. In 2017 he published the book of poetry &quot;Leo Meo – Songs to My Grandson&quot; containing these and other poems he had written.

===&quot;The Powerbroker – Mark Leibler, an Australian Jewish Life&quot;===
In 2020, Gawenda published an unauthorized biography of Australian lawyer Mark Leibler. This book shows how Leibler rose to a position of immense influence in Australian public life by skilfully entwining his roles as a Zionist leader and a tax lawyer to some of the country’s richest people. The book has interviews with former Prime Ministers Paul Keating, John Howard, Julia Gillard and Indigenous leader Noel Pearson.

===&quot;My Life as a Jew&quot;===
His 2023 memoir covers much of Gawenda&#x27;s life, from childhood experiences in a secular household, living a mainly non-Jewish life, to becoming a journalist and rising to editor of &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper. The book examines the rise of antisemitism and anti-Zionism and Gawenda&#x27;s personal journey, embracing his Jewish identity late in life.

===Columnist===
In 2023, Gawenda began contributing columns and commentary to &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper, writing about journalism and its challenges.

==Personal life==
Gawenda has a wife and two children, Evie and Chaskiel/Husky, and resides in Melbourne. Gawenda is the uncle of television producer and former sports writer and founding executive produce of &quot;The Footy Show&quot;, Harvey Silver.

<text>The Amphicar Model 770 is an amphibious automobile which was launched at the 1961 New York Auto Show. It was made in West Germany and marketed from 1961 to 1968, with production ceasing in 1965.

Designed by Hans Trippel, the amphibious vehicle was manufactured by the Quandt Group at Lübeck and at Berlin-Borsigwalde, with a total of 3,878 manufactured in a single generation. The name &quot;Amphicar&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;amphibious&quot; and &quot;car.&quot;

A spiritual descendant of the Volkswagen Schwimmwagen, and the Trippel SG6, the Amphicar offered only modest performance compared to most contemporary boats or cars, featured navigation lights and flag as mandated by the US Coast Guard – and after operation in water, required greasing at 13 points, one of which required removal of the rear seat.

In 2014, the publication &quot;Petrolicious&quot; described the Amphicar as &quot;good for one thing: fun. It’s not quick or flashy, but it’s iconic, unique and friendly. What more could you ask from a vintage car? The Amphicar might not make any sense and that’s precisely why it’s so wonderful.&quot;

==Product description (1966 Amphicar Model 770)==
Engine: Triumph four-cylinder engine of 1147 cc, 8:1 compression ratio, rated at 43 bhp

Chassis/body

Appearance

Front undersurface is slightly pointed and sharply cut away below. The wheels are set low, so that the vehicle stands well above ground level when on dry land. Front and rear bumpers are placed low on the body panels (but fairly high in relation to dry ground). The one-piece windshield is curved. The foldable top causes the body style to be classified as &quot;cabriolet&quot;. Its water propulsion is provided by twin propellers mounted under the rear bumper. The Amphicar is made of mild steel.

==Powertrain==

The Amphicar&#x27;s engine was mounted at the rear of the craft, driving the rear wheels through a 4-speed manual transmission. For use in the water, the same engine drove a pair of reversible propellers at the rear, with a second gear lever engaging forward or reverse drive. Once in the water, the main gear lever would normally be left in neutral. By engaging first gear as well as drive to the propellers when approaching a boat ramp, the Amphicar could drive itself out of the water.

== Performance ==
The powerplant was the 1147 cc (69 in³) Standard SC engine from the British Triumph Herald 1200. Many engines were tried in prototypes, but the Triumph engine was &quot;state of the art&quot; in 1961 and it had the necessary combination of performance, weight, cool running, and reliability. Updated versions of this engine remained in production in the Triumph Spitfire until 1980. The Amphicar engine had a power output of 43 hp (32 kW) at 4750 rpm, slightly more than the Triumph Herald due to a shorter exhaust. Designated the &quot;Model 770&quot;, the Amphicar could achieve speeds of 7 knots in the water and 70 mph (110 km/h) on land. Later versions of the engine displaced 1296 cc and 1493 cc and produced up to .

In water as well as on land, the Amphicar is steered with the front wheels, making it less maneuverable than a conventional boat.

== In popular culture ==

In June, 1965, two Amphicars successfully navigated the Yukon River in Alaska.

In September, 1965, two Amphicars crossed the English Channel

In August, 1967, four Amphicars participated in the 1967 Yukon River Flotilla a joint Alaska-Yukon Centennial project commemorating the memory of the rugged Klondike gold-seekers who sailed down the Yukon River in 1898.

Lea Edgar wrote in &quot;BC Shipping News&quot;, October 2018: “One more local story regarding the Amphicar is that of the 1967 Yukon River Flotilla. A 10-day, 460-mile trip from Whitehorse down river to Dawson City was planned as a joint Alaska-Yukon Centennial project. Fifty-four craft were used, of those, four were Amphicars. The owners of the Amphicars were all Americans from Alaska. On August 16, the flotilla, including the Amphicars, made it to Dawson City where Discovery Day celebrations were in full swing.”

US President Lyndon B. Johnson owned an Amphicar. Johnson, a known practical joker, was said to enjoy frightening visitors at his Johnson City, Texas, ranch by driving them downhill in his Amphicar, directly into his property&#x27;s lake, all the while shouting that he had malfunctioning brakes.

Amphicars appear in the films &quot;Rotten to the Core&quot; (1965), &quot;The Sandwich Man&quot; (1966), &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot; (1967), &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot; (1968), &quot;The Laughing Woman&quot; (1969), &quot;Savannah Smiles&quot; (1982), and &quot;Pontiac Moon&quot; (1994), and in episode five of season four of &quot;The Avengers&quot; (&quot;Castle De&#x27;ath&quot;, 1965). It also appears in the TV movie &quot;All the Way&quot; (2016). In a fifth-season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, an antique filmstrip touts Springfield&#x27;s famous &quot;aqua-car&quot; factory, showing Amphicars rolling off an assembly line and into the water.

==History==

Production started in late 1960. By the end of 1963, complete production was stopped. From 1963 to 1965 cars were assembled from shells and parts inventory built up in anticipation of sales of 25,000 units, with the last new build units assembled in 1965. Cars were titled in the year they actually sold rather than when they were produced, e.g. an unsold Amphicar assembled in 1963 or 1965 could be titled as 1967 or 1968 if that was when it was first sold. Although the inventory could not be sold in the U.S. in the 1968 model year or later due to new environmental and USDOT emissions and safety equipment standards, they were available in other countries into 1968. The remaining inventory of unused parts was eventually purchased by Hugh Gordon of Santa Fe Springs, California.

Most Amphicars were sold in the United States. Cars were sold in the United Kingdom from 1964. Total production was 3,878 vehicles, of which only 97 were right-hand drive. Some were used in the Berlin police department and others were fitted for rescue operations.

==Amphicar shows and rides==
Amphicar owners regularly convene during the spring, summer, and fall at various locations nationwide for &quot;swim-ins&quot;, the largest of which is held at Grand Lake St. Marys State Park, Ohio.

In 2015, the Boathouse at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Disney Springs in Orlando, Florida, began offering public Amphicar rides to visitors, charging $125 per ride for groups of up to three. Disney heavily re-engineered and enhanced the eight Amphicars of various original colors in its fleet for safety, reliability, and comfort.

<text>Chandra Stewart North-Blaylock (born July 31, 1970, in Dallas, Texas, United States) is an American model.

==Early years==
Growing up, North had aspirations of becoming a professional ballerina. In her teen years, North was a bit rebellious. While her classmates would be attending school dance, she would be hitting up underground night clubs. While attending Southern Methodist University, she was scouted by a male model during her spring break. Shortly thereafter, she signed with The Kim Dawson Agency in Dallas and she secured modeling jobs for local news papers and department store catalogs.

In 1991, North left Texas to pursue her dream of becoming a professional dancer. Shortly after moving to New York City, her modeling career moved her to Paris. After struggling to make it in Europe, North came back to New York where she met her future husband, then a bicycle messenger. With his support, she eventually landed more work.

==Career==
In 1995, North featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition in which she wore a grass bikini. Since then, she has been featured in advertisements for Alberta Ferretti, Versace, Saks Fifth Avenue, Givenchy, J.Crew, Valentino, Chanel, and Banana Republic. North has walked the runways for Christian Dior, DKNY, and Chanel. North has also graced the covers of Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire, and Harper&#x27;s Bazaar.

In 1999, North was featured in the Pirelli Calendar. North is currently represented by DNA Model Management, FM Model Agency and Kim Dawson Agency.

In 2012, North was the print model to celebrate Shiseido&#x27;s 140th anniversary.

<text>Mount Didgori (), 1647 m, is situated some 40 km west of Georgia’s capital Tbilisi in the eastern part of the Trialeti Range, which is part of the Lesser Caucasus. It was a site of the celebrated victory won by the Georgian king David IV over the Seljuk armies on August 12, 1121. The battlefield extends for several kilometers and is covered by abundant subalipine meadows. Early in the 1990s, an impressive monument was erected at the site of the battle, consisting of dozens of massive swords pushed into the ground and posing as crosses, and colossal sculptures of dismembered bodies of warriors scattered in the meadows, centred around a massive concrete column in the shape of a &#x27;deda bodzi&#x27;, the central column in medieval Georgian dwellings. The monument is located at 41º45&#x27;38 N, 44º30&#x27;29 E. The monument was designed by sculptor Merab Berdzenishvili and architect Tamaz Gabunia, who were awarded the for their work in 1995.

Since 1997, a commemoration of the battle, &quot;Didgoroba&quot; has been held at the monument each August 12.

Didgori is also the name of a Georgian Armoured Personnel Carrier.

<text>The Journey of Ibn Fattouma (Arabic:رحلة ابن فطومة) is an intermittently provocative fable written and published by Nobel Prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz in 1983. It was translated from Arabic into English in 1992 by Denys Johnson-Davies and published by Doubleday.

==Plot summary==
Ibn Fattouma, more commonly known by his birth name Qindil Muhammad al-Innabi, is a Muslim man disillusioned by the corruption in his home city. When he asks his teacher why a land whose people obey the tenets of Islam suffers so, Qindil is told that the answer he seeks lies far away from the city, in the land of Gebel; the land of perfection. The teacher encourages Ibn Fattouma to seek the land of Gebel, where such problems have been solved. The teacher attempted to journey there himself, but civil war in neighboring lands and the demands of family ultimately prevented him from completing the journey. Further complicating Qindil&#x27;s impending expedition, no documents exist about the land and no one is known to have returned from Gebel.

Qindil is determined to embark on the journey, for he feels betrayed by his mother, who remarried, and his lover, who was stolen by the sultan. He gives his farewells to his family and proceeds on a caravan out of his home city to the land of Mashriq. In this sexually libertine society, the women and men do not marry; rather, they share each other&#x27;s partners. The religion of Mashriq is primitive and pagan; the moon is worshiped as a god. Qindil questions the land&#x27;s customs, but he soon acculturates to their ways. He settles in Mashriq with a woman named Arousa and they have five children. Because of Qindil&#x27;s insistence upon teaching his eldest son Islam, he is exiled from Mashriq and prohibited from seeing Arousa or their children again.

Qindil then travels to the land of Haïra. The invasion of Mashriq by militaristic Haïra further separates Qindil from his family, and when the annexation of Mashriq is finished, Arousa is brought to Haïra as a slave, who is then bought by Qindil. The chamberlain of the god-king of Haïra desires Arousa as a wife and arranges Qindil to be jailed. Twenty years pass in Haïra in jail before the god-king is overthrown, and the chamberlain, who is also later jailed, tells Qindil to look in the neighboring land of Halba for Arousa and children.
In Halba, the freedom of the individual is the most important value. All religions peacefully coexist and Halba openly encourages freedom of inquiry. The Halbans are also aggressive promoters of their philosophy of life in other nations; preparations are underway as Qindil arrives for a war with neighboring Aman. There, Qindil meets and marries Samia, an intellectual Muslim pediatrician in Halba&#x27;s hospital. Qindil reunites with Arousa, who thought he was lost and had since married a Buddhist man. With Samia&#x27;s reluctant approval, Qindil decides to continue his journey before war makes such travel impossible.

In the land of Aman, justice is held as the most important value. To maintain order, he leaves just as Aman and Halba prepare to fight. His next stop, the land of Ghuroub, finds Qindil questioned to the depths of his being. Does he earnestly desire to go to Gebel, and why? Qindil states as he has many times before that he seeks to learn Gebel&#x27;s secret of perfection in life and share it with the people of his homeland. He and the other seekers of Gebel are driven from Ghuroub by an invading army from Aman, and after months of travel, they sight Gebel itself from a mountain peak. As Qindil descends to continue his journey, the story ends leaving the reader to surmise whether or not he reached the city.

==Setting==
The setting of the story is not clearly spatial or temporal; the journey moves through a space that can represent the historical Middle East, an analogical space of different periods of history or a simply imaginary space. It can be viewed as some combination of these spaces.

The story may be allegorical for the rise of Human Civilization. Qindil starts his adventure from his homeland, the Dar al-Islam, which practices traditional, familiar Islamic values but imperfectly, and with a great deal of corruption. When Qindil sets out, the first land he visits is the Land of Mashriq. Mashriq is the land of the sunrise, and may represent early civilization; particularly that of pre-Islamic Arabia. Mashriq employs a very basic religion based on worship of the moon, and incorporates primal, tribal, values representative of early human development.

Haira may thus represent the rise of human civilization and the chaos that accompanied it. Haira means “confusion” in Arabic and features the rule of a divine king and frequent wars. Its values seem to reflect those of absolutism; though without any clear historical period in mind. Qindil travels to the Halba following Haira, Halba is the land of freedom. Halba may represent Western civilization, and includes democracy, wealth, and sophistication. Halba eventually conquers both Mashriq and Haira; plausibly mirroring the historical rise of the West.

Qindil then travels to Aman; the land of security and total justice. Aman employs communism and is engaged with a struggle for influence against Halba; an interesting parallel to the time the book was written in 1983. Finally Qindil stops at Ghuroub; the land of the sunset. Ghuroub is interesting, as it has no obvious parallel in the real world. It is a transitory place, where people train to go forth to the land of Gebel. Qindil then journeys to the Land of Gebel, which is at the top of a mountain. Gebel symbolizes heaven on Earth. No man has ever returned from Gebel, the land of perfect society.

Some of the places mentioned in the book, such as Gebel, Haira and Mashriq were names of historical kingdoms in the Classical and Medieval Middle East. They are not just analogies but also references to the real, if much mythologised past.

==Analysis==
Mahfouz turned away from Western literature and looked to Arabic modes for narrative inspiration. Medieval Arabic influence was shown in the story&#x27;s episodic style with little interest in a central plot. Mahfouz used the Journey of Ibn Battuta as an inspiration but his character, Ibn Fattouma travels through time, not space. Each land fits into the evolution of civilization. The Journey is an allegory for Mahfouz&#x27;s search for a perfect socio-political system. Each land was named after its time in the history of man; Mashriq was sunrise, Haira bewilderment, Halba arena, Aman security, Ghuroub sunset, and Gebel mountain. This story ends in the present as it is fitting that it does not continue into the future. Mahfouz shows the progression of man from undeveloped to modern, developed civilizations.

The land of Mashriq (or Sunrise in the original text) represents the origin of human society. A tribal land, it has an animist religion and the people live comparatively simply to Qindil&#x27;s homeland. Next in the progression is the land of Haira (or Bewilderment), a land representing the transition to absolute monarchies in the course of human civilization. Haira incites a war against Mashriq, triumphs and promptly takes over it, showing the spread of monarchy as well as the spread of these empires. Next is Halba (or Arena), a land of freedom, where all religions are tolerated and freedom of speech is guaranteed and practice. However, it is plagued by crime. The democracy engages in war against Halba, succeeds, and takes over Haira, like the revolutions and change to democracy in much of the world in the 18th to 20th centuries. Next is Aman (or Security), a communist society in which equality is enforced and the government controls all aspects of society. The president, however, has absolute power and has a distinct social and monetary advantage over the commoners. A parallel in the world would be the Soviet Union. The land engages in a war with Halba and takes over Ghuroub out of fear of Halba taking it, much like the influence America and the Soviet Union had over other countries in the Cold War of recent times. The victor is left ambiguous, just as the victor of the Cold War was unknown in 1983, when the novel was written. Last is the land of Gebel (or Mountain); a utopia. It represents the climax of human society and the workings of the society are left unknown, just as the workings of a utopia today are unknown to humanity.

==Characters==
Qindil Muhammad al-Innabi - The narrator and the main protagonist, he is the son of an eighty-year-old man, Muhammad al-Innabi, who fell in love with a seventeen-year-old girl, Fattouma al-Azhari. He was given the name &#x27;Ibn Fattouma&#x27; i.e. &#x27;son of Fattouma&#x27;.

Arousa - The girl that Qindil falls in love with in the Land of Mashriq but the ways of the land are different and he can&#x27;t marry (or purchase) her outright. But a union, of sorts, is established and Qindil settles down in the land, staying for years and fathering her children. Driven to bring his son up on the principles of Islam, he runs afoul of local customs and is arrested and deported. They are united momentarily after Mashriq is conquered are separated when Qindil is falsely arrested. Arousa then marries a Buddhist and sees Qindil in the Land of Halba in a jewelry shop that Qindil is working in.

Ham - Qindil&#x27;s mentor throughout the land of Haira, he is the owner of the inn for foreign travelers.

Fam - Qindil&#x27;s mentor throughout the land of Mashriq, he is the owner of the inn for foreign travelers.

Halima Adlial-Tantawi - She is a young woman in Qindil&#x27;s homeland whom he spots walking throughout the streets with her father who is blind. Immediately, Qindil starts to admire her and decides to ask for her hand in marriage. Qindil&#x27;s mother is reluctant at first, due to the fact that Halima originates from a family that is of a lesser class and states that Qindil is too young and can marry any other woman but Qindil is insistent.

Fattouma al-Azhari - When only seventeen, Fattouma al-Azhari married her husband of eighty years old. Qindil is given the name &#x27;Ibn Fattouma&#x27; which means &#x27;son of Fattouma&#x27; by his brothers as a means of &quot;washing their hands of any possible relationship with them and casting doubts upon my mother.&quot;

Muhammad al-Innabi - Qindil&#x27;s father, who is eighty when he falls in love with Fattouma al-Azhari, Qindil&#x27;s mother and had produced seven notable merchant sons before him.

Samia - Qindil falls in love with her in the land of Halba. Qindil&#x27;s relationships with Arousa and Samia over the course of his travels provide him with deep happiness and satisfaction. His greatest sorrows are in losing his two loves.

Sheik Maghagha al-Gibeili - Qindil&#x27;s teacher who made a journey himself but had to stop before he could visit the land of Gebel due to a war. He marries Qindil&#x27;s mother as he &quot;cannot bear his solitude any longer&quot; at the same time as Qindil&#x27;s marriage to Halima is arranged. He is the tutor who extols the virtues of travel as a way of finding the true meaning of life.

Sheikh Hamada al Sabki - Qindil meets him in the land of Halba. He gives the call to prayer in the streets and tells Qindil that in the land of Halba, people preached that Islam encouraged homosexuality. Qindil is taken aback by this news and is disappointed by the New Islam that was manifesting itself in this country. Imam invites Qindil to his house and there, he introduces his daughter, Samia, to him.

The Sage in the Land of Ghuroub - He is an Old man located in the forest. He is the instructor of those who are perplexed, and prepares those who desire to make the journey to the Land of Gebel.

==Theme==

Throughout his ensuing journey, Ibn Fattouma undergoes many struggles both on an existential and intellectual level as he attempts to determine the meaning of life in relation to who he is. Themes present in Journey of Ibn Fattouma revolve around how to correctly organize a society and his personal existential struggles. The main character in the allegory, Qindil, travels to many lands to try to discover a perfect land and when he cannot find one, readers are left to realize whether a perfect society really exists and what a society should be based on. Qindil attempts to determine the meaning of life in relation to who he is. The story relies heavily on self-interpretation creating a path to discovery for Qindil and the reader leaving everyone to question what the real journey was.

==Translations==
The Journey of Ibn Fattouma was first published in Arabic in 1983, as رحلة إبن فطوم. and has since been translated in German, Italian, and English. The English translation was done by Denys Johnson-Davies.
In 2022, the book was translated into Pashto by veteran Pashto writer, Hamayun Masoud, from Swat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It was published by &#x27;Dust On Book&#x27;, Peshawar.

==Commercial reception==
On a scale of A-F, complete-review.com gave Journey of Ibn Fattouma an A−, stating that it is “a clever...parable of different forms of governments and societies.”

==Critical reception==

“The style of the Arabic original is descriptive, sensuous, and sometimes moving. The translation, coming from the pen of an experienced translator, is meticulously faithful to the original while maintaining complete idiomatic English that flows smoothly.”- Issa Peters, World Literature Today

As said by The Complete Review, “The Journey of Ibn Fattouma is a clever if occasionally too simplistic parable of different forms of government and society, seen especially -- and very effectively -- in relation to Islam (both theoretical and the less-than-perfect real-life examples of Islamic states). Qindil&#x27;s travels and observations are engaging and very nicely related… though much is a bit too quickly brushed over. War breaks out several times too often; presented as it is, it comes to look like an inevitability in practically each of these situations, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be what Mahfouz means. Qindil&#x27;s love-life is also a bit odd, his passion understandable but also too quickly indulged in (and then disposed of, as he leaves family after family behind). But the strengths of the text easily outweigh all the weaknesses. An enjoyable and thoughtful novel, certainly recommended,” and gave it a rating of A−.

Erik Cohen describes: “The original, archaic pilgrimage” as “the quest for the mythical land of pristine existence, of no evil or suffering, the primaeval centre from which man originally emerged, but eventually lost it,” (Cohen 182).. . . . . Erik is an Adjunct Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, as well as a member of EPPC&#x27;s board of directors. As Issa Peters says, “The Journey of Ibn Fattouma, therefore, is a kind of pilgrim&#x27;s progress, but the pilgrim here is more of a social reformer than a religious believer impelled by an apocalyptic vision of the divine.&quot;

==Inspiration==
Ibn Battuta, a 14th-century Moroccan explorer, was the inspiration and historical model for the fictitious journey in The Journey of Ibn Fattouma. He was one of the greatest travelers, having visited most of the known world of his day. Ibn Battuta recorded his experiences for posterity in his famous Journey of Ibn Battuta (partly translated into English by H A R Gibb in 1929). Based on the title, The Journey of Ibn Fattouma, Naguib Mahfouz clearly wants readers to be aware of the medieval work while reading his novel. Mahfouz was inspired by Ibn Battuta&#x27;s journey to write his book, but he did not approach his historically modeled book with a respectful attitude. His intention was partly to parody Ibn Battuta&#x27;s journey. “Whereas Ibn Battuta travelled in space, his fictitious descendant travels in time; the five &#x27;lands&#x27; he visits being, within the allegorical framework of the book, symbolic of stages in the evolution of organised society from the dawn of history to the present day.”

Mahfouz shows that Ibn Fattouma is modeled off of Ibn Battuta, but is not a mirror image of him. Ibn Fattouma criticizes his homeland, whereas Ibn Battuta idealized Islam, regardless of where he traveled. Ibn Fattouma&#x27;s critiques of Islam seem to create the basis of his journey, as he searches for a place where life is far more ideal than his homeland. He questions God as a merciful being after seeing ignorance and poverty. This fuels his journey and creates a more complex character than if the story was simply following Ibn Battuta, blindly mimicking his every trait.

==Literary significance and criticism==
The story is a &quot;Morality Play&quot;- it is not just what it may first seem, but in reality it&#x27;s a story of “extoling the virtues of tolerance and understanding&quot;
The Journey of Ibn Fattouma is a simple story of government and society. Critics say that the story is engaging, yet at the same time redundant.

Mahfouz is able to capture a lifetime&#x27;s worth of experiences in one short novel. He is considered as one of the most western of contemporary Arab novelists.

Naguib Mahfouz, the author of The Journey of Ibn Fattouma, portrays himself in his writing, and in the lands and characters of the novel. The revolution of 1919 in Egypt influenced Mahfouz and inspired him to place a symbol of rebellion in the lands Qindil visits. Qindil travels to Mashriq, and discovers the underlying rules and restrictions of the seemingly free and open land. He rebels against the land&#x27;s religion and attempts to teach his son the Islamic faith. As a result, Qindil is exiled and sent away on the next caravan that arrives. Similar to the revolution in Egypt, Qindil did not aggressively revolt using violence and anger. He was reserved and subtle in his actions. While The Journey of Ibn Fattouma symbolizes the development of human history, it also reflects the author and his connection to the Egyptian Revolution.

The novel is centered around a young traveler, Ibn Fattouma, who closely resembles a 14th-century traveler, Ibn Battuta. While Battuta did not travel to lands similar to those in the novel, his personality and background matched Fattouma&#x27;s. Ibn Battuta&#x27;s purpose was to see how the Islamic religion was perceived and practiced in different parts of the world. Ibn Fattouma was based on this real person, Ibn Battuta, who shared with him many similarities.

<doc id="854940" wikidata="Q7164790" url="?curid=854940" title="Pensions Act 1995">
<text>The Pensions Act 1995 (c. 26) is a piece of United Kingdom legislation to improve the running of pension schemes.

==Background==
Following the death of Robert Maxwell, it became clear that he had embezzled a large amount of money from the pension fund of Mirror Group Newspapers. As a result of this, a review was established to look into ways that the running of pension schemes could be improved. The end result was the Pensions Act 1995.

==Overview==
The main features of the Act included:

* The establishment of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority
* The Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR) to ensure that all pension schemes had a minimum amount of money
* A compensation fund for pension schemes in the event of fraud
* Protection for existing pension scheme benefits so that they could not be reduced in the future without member consent
* A requirement for pension schemes to have member nominated trustees
* Greater disclosure of information to members
* The introduction of clear documentation showing what should be paid into a scheme, and monitoring of those contributions
* A minimum rate of increase to apply once in payment to pension earned after the date on which the Act came into force

Many of the features introduced by the Act were abolished or amended by the Pensions Act 2004. The MFR was heavily criticised in the Myners Report (2001), which was a HM Treasury sponsored report into institutional investment in the UK. The Myners Report identified three problems with the MFR:

* For some pension funds, the level of assets under the MFR was insufficient to provide the benefits promised by the scheme
* Regulatory costs for sponsoring firms increased without any reduction in the risks of fund insolvency
* Sponsoring firms focused on meeting the narrow requirements of the MFR, rather than on ensuring that the scheme was appropriately funded.

The Pensions Act 2004 replaced the MFR from September 2005 with a new scheme-specific &quot;statutory funding objective&quot; (SFO), allowing more flexibility to individual schemes&#x27; circumstances whilst at the same time protecting members&#x27; benefits. The Act established the Pension Regulator with the power to require sponsoring companies to fully fund their pension liabilities, by adopting an appropriate recovery strategy consistent with the SFO. Liu and Tonks (2012) examine the effect of a company&#x27;s pension commitments on its dividend and investment policies, assessing the impact of funding rules under the MFR, and also under the funding requirements introduced under the Pensions Act 2004. They find a strong negative relationship between a firm&#x27;s dividend payments and its pension contributions, but a weaker effect on investments. They found that dividend and investment sensitivities to pension contributions were more pronounced after the introduction of the Pensions Act 2004.

==State pensions==
The Act also affects state pensions . A significant change was the phasing in of equalisation of state pension ages for men and women over a ten-year period.

<doc id="854942" wikidata="Q568858" url="?curid=854942" title="Freeway (1996 film)">
<text>Freeway is a 1996 American dark comedy crime thriller film written and directed by Matthew Bright and produced by Oliver Stone. It stars Kiefer Sutherland, Reese Witherspoon and Brooke Shields. The film&#x27;s plot is a dark take on the fairy tale &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.

The film premiered at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival where it competed for the Grand Jury Prize. It was later screened on HBO on June 8, 1996, and due to favorable reviews, it was given a brief theatrical release. The film has gone on to achieve cult status.

==Plot==
Vanessa Lutz is a 15-year-old illiterate teenager living south of Los Angeles. Her mother, Ramona, is arrested in a prostitution sting, and her stepfather, Larry, is taken in on drug and child abuse charges. Social worker Mrs. Sheets comes to take Vanessa away, but she runs away.

Taking her mother&#x27;s run-down car, Vanessa plans to live with her grandmother in Stockton. Along the way, she stops to see her boyfriend Chopper Wood, a gang member, to tell him about her trip. He gives her a gun to sell upon arriving at her destination. Shortly after Vanessa leaves, he is killed in a drive-by shooting. The car breaks down, leaving her on the side of the highway where she is picked up by Bob Wolverton, a counselor at a school for boys with emotional problems. He offers to take her as far as L.A.

Over the long drive, Vanessa comes to trust Bob and confesses the details of her dysfunctional life, including sexual abuse by her stepfather and foster parents. That evening, Bob reveals he is a serial killer dubbed the &quot;I-5 Killer&quot; and attacks Vanessa. She turns the tables on him, however, and shoots him several times before fleeing to a diner where her blood-stained appearance prompts the owners to call 911. She is arrested and questioned by police detectives Mike Breer and Garnet Wallace, who write her off as a carjacker, even though she insists Bob tried to kill her and told her about his crimes.

Bob survives, but the bullet wounds have left him severely handicapped and facially disfigured. Vanessa is put on trial; Bob is portrayed as an innocent victim with no criminal record, whereas Vanessa has a long string of prior offenses. Vanessa is sent to prison, while Bob and his socialite wife Mimi, who knows nothing of his crimes, are treated like heroes.

Initially scared, Vanessa makes friends in prison who include heroin-addicted lesbian Rhonda and a vicious Hispanic gang leader named Mesquita. Vanessa plots to escape to her grandmother&#x27;s house and fashions a shiv from a toothbrush. During their transport to a maximum security prison, Vanessa and Mesquita escape after killing a security guard, and they go their separate ways.

Re-examining evidence, the detectives realize Vanessa was telling the truth. They search Bob&#x27;s home and find child pornography and human remains in a storage shed. Horrified, Mimi commits suicide. Evading the police, Bob travels to Vanessa&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s trailer, using the address written on a picture Vanessa had shown him.

Posing as a prostitute, Vanessa steals a car from a prospective john, driving to the trailer. She finds Bob in bed wearing her grandmother&#x27;s nightgown and nightcap with the covers pulled up to his nose. A struggle ensues, culminating in her strangling him. Breer and Wallace arrive, finding the bodies of Bob and Vanessa&#x27;s grandmother. Outside, Vanessa sits in a chair in a daze, and then asks the detectives if they have a cigarette. They all smile and laugh.

==Cast==
== Production ==
Oliver Stone served as one of the film&#x27;s executive producers. Writer and director Matthew Bright said the film underwent multiple edits during post-production and he was not able to preserve his original version for the film, as Stone was away in Nepal at the time. It was filmed on location in Los Angeles, California from July 31 to August 28, 1995.

== Release ==
&quot;Freeway&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 1996 where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.

=== Censorship ===
In Australia, when Columbia TriStar Home Video submitted a VHS of the original 104-minute print of the film to the Australian Classification Board (then known as the Office of Film and Literature Classification), it was refused classification. The ACB had already approved of a censored version, running 102 minutes, that removed two scenes: one in which Sutherland asks Witherspoon for anal sex on top of his excessive use of obscenities, and another in which a deceased 91-year-old grandmother is shown with a vase covering her private parts and her legs spread apart; the cut version remains available on video in that country, where it is rated R18+.

==Critical reception==

Critics lauded the film&#x27;s hard-edged satire and performances. Film critic Roger Ebert gave &quot;Freeway&quot; three and a half stars out of four and stated, &quot;Like it or hate it (or both), you have to admire its skill, and the over-the-top virtuosity of Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland.&quot; It received &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot; on &quot;Siskel and Ebert At the Movies&quot;. Joe Baltake of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; gave &quot;Freeway&quot; four stars out of four and called it &quot;a wild, audacious drive-in attraction that takes the &#x27;high&#x27; from &#x27;highbrow&#x27; and the &#x27;low&#x27; from &#x27;lowdown&#x27; and shakes them up&quot;. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave &quot;Freeway&quot; four stars out of four and said that it was &quot;rude in the way the truth is rude—only funnier&quot;. Margaret A. McGurk wrote for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; that &quot;I didn&#x27;t particularly want to like &quot;Freeway&quot;, but I couldn&#x27;t help myself. Reese Witherspoon made me.&quot;

The film was not a success at the box office, but has achieved a cult following over the years through home video and HBO airings from fans who praise its satire, camp style, and Witherspoon&#x27;s performance.

==Home media==
&quot;Freeway&quot; was released on DVD by Republic Pictures on August 20, 1997. The film was released as a 4K Blu-ray Limited Edition by Vinegar Syndrome on November 25, 2022.

==Sequel==
A sequel titled &quot;Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby&quot;, also directed by Matthew Bright, was released in 1999. The original actors or characters did not appear in the sequel.
