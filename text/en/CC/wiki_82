<text>The Battle of the Allia was fought between the Senones – a Gallic tribe led by Brennus, who had invaded Northern Italy – and the Roman Republic.

The battle was fought at the confluence of the Tiber River and Allia brook, 11 Roman miles (16 km, 10 mi) north of Rome. The Romans were routed and subsequently Rome was sacked by the Senones. According to scholar Piero Treves, &quot;the absence of any archaeological evidence for a destruction-level of this date suggests that [this] sack of Rome was superficial only.&quot;

The date of the battle has been traditionally given as 390 BC in the Varronian chronology, based on an account of the battle by the Roman historian Livy. Plutarch noted that the battle took place &quot;just after the summer solstice when the moon was near the full [...] a little more than three hundred and sixty years from the founding [of Rome],&quot; or shortly after 393 BC. The Greek historian Polybius used a Greek dating system to derive the battle as having taken place in 387 BC, which is the most probable. Tacitus listed the date as 18 July.

==Background==
The Senones were one of the various Gallic tribes that had recently invaded northern Italy. They settled on the Adriatic Coast around what is now Rimini. According to Livy, they were called to the Etruscan town of Clusium (now Chiusi, Tuscany) by Aruns, an influential young man of the city who wanted to take revenge against Lucumo, whose son had &quot;debauched his wife&quot;. When the Senones appeared, the Clusians felt threatened and asked Rome for help. The Romans sent the three sons of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, one of Rome&#x27;s most powerful aristocrats, as ambassadors. They told the Gauls not to attack Clusium and that if they did, the Romans would fight to defend the town. They then asked to negotiate peace. The Senones accepted peace if the Clusians would give them some land. There was a quarrel and a battle broke out. The Roman ambassadors joined in. One of them killed a Senone chieftain. That was a violation of the rule that ambassadors had to be neutral. The brothers had taken sides and one of them had also killed a Senone. The Gauls withdrew to discuss what action to take.

According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Lucumo was the king of the city. He assigned the guardianship of his son to Aruns before he died. When the son became a young man, he fell in love with the wife of Aruns and seduced her. The grieving Aruns went to Gaul to sell wine, olives, and figs. The Gauls had never seen such products and asked Aruns where they were produced. He replied that they came from a large and fertile land, inhabited by only a few people who were not good fighters. He advised them to drive the people out of their land and enjoy the fruit as their own. He persuaded them to come to Italy, go to Clusium, and make war. Dionysius&#x27; account presumes that those Gauls had not invaded Italy and were in Gaul. When Quintus Fabius, one of the Roman ambassadors, killed a Gallic leader, they wanted the brothers to be handed over to them to pay the penalty for the men they had killed.

When the ambassadors of the Senones arrived in Rome and demanded the three Fabii brothers be handed over to them, the Senate was pressured by favouritism not to express opinions against the powerful Fabia family. To avoid being blamed for a possible defeat if the Gauls attacked, they referred the matter to the people. Livy wrote that &quot;those whose punishment they were asked to decide were elected military tribunes with consular powers [heads of state] for the coming year.&quot; The Gauls were enraged that those who had violated the law of nations had been honoured and marched on Rome, 130 km (81 mi) from Clusium. Livy wrote that &quot;in response to the tumult caused by their swift advance, terrified cities rushed to arms and the country folk fled, but the Gauls signified by their shouts wherever they went that their destination was Rome.&quot;

==Size of belligerent forces==
The number of fighters involved in the battle is not known for sure. Plutarch writes that the Romans were not outnumbered and had 40,000 men but that most were untrained and unaccustomed to weapons. Dionysius of Halicarnassus writes that the Romans had four well-trained legions and a levy of untrained citizens that was larger in number. That would give a rough figure of some 35,000. Diodorus Siculus writes that the Romans had 24,000 men. Livy gives no figures. The modern historians Cary and Scullard estimate that the Romans had 15,000 men and the Gauls 30,000 to 70,000. Peter Berresford Ellis gives an estimate of a minimum of 24,000 based on the assumption that &quot;the Romans had... four legions – for each consul had two legions under his command – and given that each legion had 6,000 men&quot;. He also thinks that there may have been a contingent of allied troops. He thinks that the &quot;Senones&#x27; tribal army could scarcely number more than 12,000&quot;.

The figures given by ancient historians for the size of the Roman army engaged in the battle are unlikely since they are notorious for exaggerating figures. Contrary to Berresford Ellis&#x27;s assertion, the Romans then had only two legions. The number of legions was not increased to four until later in the century, during the Second Samnite War (326-304 BC), and the first record of four legions occurred in 311 BC. The Romans then also had additional military commanders: the &quot;praetor&quot;, who had been instituted in 366 BC, and the &quot;proconsul&quot;, who was a consul who received an extension of his term of military command (the practice started in 327 BC). The first historical hints of the consuls leading more than one legion were for 299 BC (during a war with the Etruscans) and 297 BC, during the Third Samnite War (298-290 BC). The first explicit mention of a consul with two legions is in 296 BC. In 295 BC, the Romans deployed six legions; four led by the two consuls, and fought a coalition of four peoples (the Samnites, Etruscans, Umbrians and Senone Gauls) in the huge Battle of Sentinum. Two were led to another front by a &quot;praetor&quot;. The Battle of the Allia took place in the early days of Rome when the Roman army was much smaller and its command structure was much simpler. The Roman army had only two legions, and the two consuls were the sole military commanders, each heading one legion. In addition, the battle occurred in the early history of the Roman Republic, while the consulship alternated with years in which Rome was headed by military tribunes with consular power, often referred to as &quot;consular tribunes&quot; instead, and 390 BC was a year in which six consular tribunes were in charge. Therefore, Berresford Ellis&#x27;s assertion that the Romans at the battle of Allia had four legions, two for each of the two consuls, is doubly anachronistic. Moreover, the Roman legions had 6,000 men on only a few exceptional occasions. In the early days of the republic, when the Battle of the Allia took place, it was 4,200. Later, it was 5,200 when at full strength, which was often not the case. Accordingly, the Roman force at the battle was likely substantially smaller than estimated.

The size of the population of Rome also needs to be considered. In its early days, Rome was still a city-state of only regional significance, and its territory did not stretch beyond 50 km (30 mi) from the city. Cornell notes that the estimates of the population of Rome in the late 6th century BC, based on the size of its territory range between 25,000 and 50,000, and thinks that the more likely figure is 25,000-40,000. The seminal work by Fraccaro gives a pool of military manpower of 9,000 men of military age (between 17 and 47), which would require a minimum population of 30,000.

Archaeological evidence shows that in the 5th century BC, there was an economic downturn that would have precluded considerable population growth. The territory of Rome had increased by 75% by the early 4th century, but the bulk of the increase was caused by the recent conquest of the city of Veii and its territory, and its population did not have Roman citizenship, a requirement to serve in the Roman army. Such considerations make it unlikely that the size of the population of Roman citizens would have been large enough to provide a military pool of 24,000 or more soldiers at the time of the Battle of the Allia.

In addition to the above factors that give further reasons to doubt the figures given about the size of the Roman forces at the Battle of the Allia, the Romans did not have much time to prepare for the battle properly since, after their embassy was rebuffed by the Romans, the Gauls immediately marched on Rome, only a few days&#x27; marches away. The Roman army was then a part-time militia of peasant farmers levied for the military campaigning season and then returning to their farms. Not all men of military age were drafted every year. Some of the soldiers would have lived some distance from Rome and so needed time to walk there, the main means of travel for peasants.

The size of the Senone force should not be overestimated, either. The estimate given by Cary and Scullard of 30,000-70,000 (see above) is highly unlikely. Berresford Ellis rightly points out that his figure of 12,000 would have been quite large for a single tribe.

The Roman army was led by the tribune Quintus Sulpicius Longus.

==Battle==

There are only two ancient accounts that provide details of the battle. One is by Livy, and the other is by Diodorus Siculus.

According to Livy, no special measures were taken in Rome, and the levy &quot;was not larger than had been usual in ordinary campaigns&quot;. The Gauls marched on Rome so quickly that &quot;Rome was thunderstruck by the swiftness at which they moved, which is shown both by the haste in mustering the army as if it were meeting a spur-of-the-moment emergency and the difficulty in getting any further than the eleventh milestone.&quot; At the eastern juncture of the Tiber River and Allia brook, the parties met; the Romans presumably were outnumbered. They did not set up camp or build a defensive rampart and they did not divine the gods, as they were supposed to. They extended the wings to avoid being outflanked, but that made their line so thin and weakened that the centre could hardly be kept together. They placed the reserves on a hill on the right. Brennus, the Senone chieftain, suspected that to be a ruse and that the reservists would attack him from the rear while he was fighting the Roman army on the plain. He, therefore, attacked the hill.

The Romans panicked. The left-wing threw their arms down and fled to the bank of the River Tiber. The Gauls killed the soldiers who were blocking one another&#x27;s paths in the disorderly flight. Those who could not swim or were weak were weighed down by their armour and drowned. Still, the majority of the men reached Veii, an Etruscan city that had recently been conquered by Rome and was near the other bank. They did not even send a messenger to warn Rome. The right-wing, further from the river and closer to the hill, fled to Rome. The Gauls were surprised at how easy their victory had been.

The ancient Greek historian Diodorus Siculus said the Romans marched and crossed the River Tiber. He is the only ancient historian who placed the battle on the right bank of the river. The Romans lined up their best troops, 24,000 men, on the plain and placed the weakest troops on the hill. The Celts also lined up, placed their best men on the hill, and easily won the clash. The bulk of the Roman soldiers on the plain fled to the river in a disorderly manner and impeded each other. The Celts killed the men in the rear. Some Romans tried to cross the river wearing their armour, which, according to Diodorus, they prized more than their lives, but that weighed them down. Some drowned and some managed to reach the bank further downstream with great effort. As the Gauls kept killing the Romans, the soldiers then threw their arms away and swam across the river. The Gauls threw javelins at them. Most of the survivors fled to the city of Veii. Some returned to Rome and reported that the army had been destroyed.

Plutarch wrote that the Gauls encamped near the confluence of the Allia with the Tiber, some 18 km (11 mi) from Rome, and attacked the Romans suddenly. There was a &quot;disorderly and shameful battle&quot;. The Roman left wing was pushed into the river and destroyed while the right-wing withdrew before the Gauls&#x27; attack from the plain to the hills and most of them fled to Rome. The rest of the survivors escaped to Veii at night. &quot;They thought that Rome was lost and all her people slain.&quot;

==Sack==
===Account of Livy===
Livy provides a detailed account of the sack of Rome. The Gauls were dumbfounded by their sudden and extraordinary victory and did not move from the place of the battle, as if they were puzzled. They feared a surprise and despoiled the dead, as was customary for them. When they did not see any hostile action, they set off and reached Rome before sunset. They saw that the city gates were open and that the walls were unmanned. That was another surprise. They decided to avoid a night battle in an unknown town and encamped between Rome and the River Anio. The inhabitants of Rome were in panic and did not know that most of their soldiers had fled to Veii, instead of Rome, and thought that the only survivors were those who fled back to Rome and that they had only a tiny force. Realising that they were defenceless, they decided to send the men of military age, the able-bodied senators and their families to the Capitoline Hill with weapons and provisions to defend the fortress. The Flamen of Quirinus and the Vestal Virgins, who were priests, were to take &quot;the sacred things of the State&quot; away and continue to perform their sacred cults. The situation was so dire that the elderly were left behind in the city and former consuls stayed with them to reconcile them with their fate. However, many of them followed their sons to the Capitoline. No one had the heart to stop them. Many people fled to the Janiculum Hill just outside the city and then dispersed to the countryside and other towns. The Flamen of Quirinus and the Vestal Virgins could take only some of the sacred objects and decided to bury the rest under the chapel next to the Flamen&#x27;s house. They set off to the Janiculum with what they could carry. Lucius Albinus, who was leaving the city on a wagon, saw them walking. He ordered his wife and children to get off and gave them and the sacred vessels of Rome a lift to Caere, an Etruscan city on the coast that was an ally of Rome.

Those who had been officers of state decided to meet their fate wearing their ceremonial dresses and &quot;the insignia of their former rank and honour and distinctions&quot;. They sat on their ivory chairs in front of their houses. The next day, the Senones entered the city. They passed through the open Colline Gate and went to the Roman Forum. They left a small body to guard there against any attack from the Capitoline and went through the streets for plunder. They did not meet anybody. People moved to other houses. The Gauls returned to the area of the Forum. Livy memorably described Gauls&#x27; encounter with the elderly patricians:

Despite the above statement, Livy wrote that the fires were not as widespread as one could expect on the first day of the capture of a city and speculated that the Gauls wanted not to destroy the city but only to intimidate the men on the Capitoline Hill into surrender to save their homes. Despite the anguish at hearing &quot;the shouts of the enemy, the shrieks of the women and boys, the roar of the flames, and the crash of houses falling in&quot;, the men were resolved to continue to defend the hill. As that continued day after day, &quot;they became as it was hardened to misery&quot;. After a few days, seeing that even though nothing survived &quot;amidst the ashes and ruin&quot; of the city, there was no sign of surrender, the Senones attacked Capitoline Hill at dawn. The defenders let the enemy climb up the steep hill and flung them down the slope. The Gauls stopped halfway up the hill. The Romans charged and inflicted such high casualties that the enemy never tried to take the hill again.

Instead, they prepared a siege. They divided their forces into two. One division besieged the hill, and the other went foraging in the territories of the neighbouring cities because all the grain around Rome had been taken to Veii by the Roman soldiers who had fled there. Some Gauls arrived at Ardea, where Marcus Furius Camillus, a great Roman military commander who had seized Veii a few years earlier, had gone when he was exiled because of accusations of embezzlement. Camillus rallied the people of Ardea to fight. He marched at night, caught the camp of the Gauls by surprise, and massacred the enemy in their sleep. Some Gallic fugitives got near Antium and were surrounded by its townsmen.

Meanwhile, in Rome, both sides were quiet. The Senones conducted the siege &quot;with great slackness&quot; and concentrated on preventing the Romans from slipping through their lines. The patrician clan of the Fabii held an annual sacrifice on the Quirinal Hill. Gaius Fabius Dorsuo came down the Capitoline carrying the sacred vessels, passed through the enemy pickets and went to the Quirinal. He duly performed the sacred rites and returned the Capitoline. Livy commented, &quot;Either the Gauls were stupefied at his extraordinary boldness, or else they were restrained by religious feelings, for as a nation they are by no means inattentive to the claims of religion&quot;.

In the meantime, the survivors of the battle who had fled to Veii began to regroup. Led by Quintus Caedicius, the centurion they chose as their leader, they routed a force of Etruscans who looted the territory of Veii and intended to attack this city. They made some prisoners lead them to another Etruscan force, which was at the salt works, and inflicted even greater losses on that force. Caedicius&#x27; forces grew, and some Romans who had fled the city went to Veii. Volunteers from Latium also joined them. Caedicius decided to summon Camillus to take the command, but that required approval of the Senate. They sent Cominius Pontius, a soldier, to Rome as a messenger. He went down the River Tiber on a cork float and reached Rome. He reached the Capitoline by scaling &quot;a precipitous rock which, owing to its steepness, the enemy had left unguarded&quot;. The Senate decreed that the popular assembly was to pass a law that annulled the banishment of Camillus and appointed him dictator (commander-in-chief). Camillus was escorted from Ardea to Veii.

The Senones either found footprints left by Cominius Pontius or discovered a relatively-easy ascent up the cliff. They climbed it and reached the summit of the Capitoline at night. They were heard not by the guards and the dogs but by the geese sacred to the goddess Juno, which woke up the Romans. Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, a former consul, knocked down a Gaul who had reached the top. He fell on those behind him. Manlius also killed some Gauls who had laid aside their weapons to cling to the rocks. He was joined by the other soldiers and the enemy was repulsed. Manlius was commended for his bravery. Quintus Sulpicius wanted to court-martial the guards who had failed to notice the enemy, but the soldiers prevented him from doing so. It was agreed to blame one man, who was thrown down the cliff.

Famine began to afflict both armies. The Gauls were also affected by pestilence. They were on low ground between the hills, which had been scorched by the fires and there was malaria. Many of them died because of disease and the heat. They started to pile the dead bodies and burn them, instead of burying them, started negotiations with the Romans and called on them to surrender because of the famine. They also hinted that they could be bought off. The Roman leaders, who were waiting for Camillus to arrive with an army from Veii, refused. Eventually, the starving soldiers called for surrender or an agreement on a ransom on the best terms that they could. Quintus Sulpicius and Brennus, the leader of the Senones, held talks. They agreed on a ransom of a thousand pounds of gold. The Senones cheated, using heavier weights to weigh the gold. When the Romans protested, &#x27;Brennus tossed his sword on the scale, uttering words intolerable to the Roman ears, namely &#x27;Vae victis,&#x27; or &#x27;Woe to the vanquished!&#x27;&quot;

Paying off the Senones to leave the city was a humiliation for the Romans. However, as Livy put it, &quot;god and man forbade the Romans to be a ransomed people&quot;. Before the weighing of the gold had been completed, Camillus reached Rome and ordered the gold not to be taken away. The Gauls said that an agreement had been made, but Camillus said that since it had been struck by an official of lesser status than he was, it was invalid. Camillus then offered battle, and the Senones were easily defeated. They were defeated again 13  km (8  mi) east of Rome. Livy wrote the &quot;slaughter was total: their camp was captured and not even the messenger survived to report the disaster&quot;.

===Account of Diodorus Siculus===
In the account of Diodorus Siculus, which is much less detailed, the Senones spent the first day after the battle by the Allia cutting off the heads of the dead, which he claimed was their custom, and then encamped by the city for two days. Meanwhile, the despairing inhabitants of Rome thought that the whole army had been wiped out and that there was no chance of resistance. Many of them fled to other towns. The leaders of the city ordered food, gold, silver and other possessions to be taken to Capitoline Hill, which was then fortified. The Senones thought that the noise in the city meant that a trap was being prepared. However, on the fourth day, they broke down the city gates and pillaged the city. They made daily attacks on the Capitoline but did not hurt any civilians. They suffered many casualties. Finding that they could not take it by force, they decided to lay siege.

Meanwhile, the Etruscans raided the Roman territory around Veii, capturing prisoners and booty. The Roman soldiers who had fled to Veii ambushed them, put them to flight, seized their camp, regained the booty, and took a large number of weapons. The Romans reconstituted an army, gathered men who had dispersed in the countryside when they fled Rome and then decided to relieve the siege of the Capitoline Hill. Cominius Pontius was sent as a messenger to the Capitoline Hill to tell the besieged about the plan and that the men at Veii were waiting for an opportunity to attack. There is no mention of Camillus in the account of Diodorus Siculus.

Pontius swam across the River Tiber and went up a cliff, which was difficult to climb. After giving his message, he returned to Veii. The Gauls noticed the track left by Pontius and ascended the same cliff. The Roman guards were neglectful of their watch and the Gauls escaped detection. When the geese made a noise, the guards rushed against the attackers. Diodorus called Manlius Capitolinus Marcus Mallius and wrote that he cut off the hand of the first Senone climber with his sword and pushed him down the hill. Since the hill was steep, all enemy soldiers fell and died. Then, the Romans negotiated peace and persuaded the Gauls &quot;upon receipt of one thousand pounds of gold, to leave the city and to withdraw from Roman territory&quot;.

===Account of Plutarch===
Plutarch painted a greater picture of destruction and killings than Livy. The Gauls went to Rome on the third day after the battle, where the gates were open, and the walls were unguarded. They marched through the Colline gate. Brennus had the Capitoline Hill surrounded and went to the Forum. He was surprised to see the men sitting outdoors and remaining quiet without fear when they were approached, &quot;leaning on their staves and gazing into one another&#x27;s faces&quot;. The Gauls hesitated to get close to them and touch them and regarded them as superior beings. However, a Gaul plucked up his courage and stroked the long beard of Papirius Marcus, who hit him hard on the head with his staff. The Gauls then killed all men and sacked and burned the houses for many days. The defenders of Capitoline Hill did not surrender and repulsed an attack. The Gauls killed everyone they captured, including women, children and the elderly. The Gauls entered Rome shortly after the Ides of July and withdrew from the city about the Ides of February (February 13), the siege lasting seven months.

Plutarch also notes that some Gauls reached Ardea and that Camillus rallied the city against them and attacked them. On hearing the news, the neighbouring cities called to arms the men of military age, especially the Romans who had fled to Veii. They wanted Camillus to be their commander but refused to do so before he was legally elected. Plutarch then relayed the story of Pontius Cominius and his mission to Capitoline Hill. Camillus could not cross the bridge over the Tiber because the Gauls were guarding it and so he swam across supported by pieces of cork and went to the Carmental Gate. When he reached the top of the Capitoline, the Senate appointed Camillus as dictator. Camillus gathered soldiers from the allies and went to Veii, where there were 20,000 soldiers.

After the episode of the geese of Juno, the Gauls were less hopeful. They were short of provisions but did not go foraging because they feared Camillus. They were also affected by the disease because they were encamped amid ruins, and there were dead bodies scattered everywhere. The wind scattered ash, which made breathing difficult. They were also suffering from the Mediterranean heat to which they were not accustomed. The Gauls &quot;were now whiling away the seventh month in its siege. For all these reasons the mortality was great in their camp; so many were the dead that they could no longer be buried&quot;.

The defenders of the Capitoline, in turn, could not get news from Camillus because the city was closely guarded by the enemy. Famine worsened, and the city became dejected and agreed to pay a ransom.

When Camillus arrived in Rome, he lifted the gold from the scales and said that it was the Roman custom to deliver the city with iron, not gold. He then said that the agreement to pay a ransom had not been made legally since it was made without him, who had been made the legal ruler, and so it was not binding. The Gauls now had to say what they wanted because &quot;he [had] come with legal authority to grant pardon to those who asked it, and to inflict punishment on the guilty, unless they showed repentance&quot;. Brennus began a skirmish. The two sides could not fight a battle because no battle array was possible &quot;in the heart of the ruined city&quot;. Brennus led his men to their camp and then left the city during the night. At dawn, Camillus caught up with them and routed them &quot;[of] the fugitives, some were at once pursued and cut down, but most of them scattered abroad, only to be fallen upon and slain by the people of the surrounding villages and cities&quot;.

News of the Gallic sack reached Greece. Plutarch mentions an inaccurate story by Heracleides Ponticus and that Aristotle wrote about the capture of Rome by the Gauls and said that the saviour of the city was &quot;a certain Lucius&quot;, not Camillus.

=== Assessment of Augustine ===
Augustine discusses the causes in De Civitate Dei, part I, book III.

===Modern assessment of accounts===
The accounts of the battle of the Allia and the sack of Rome were written centuries after the events, and their reliability is questionable. That may also account for the discrepancies between Livy and Diodorus Siculus concerning the sack of the city.

The rescue of the city by Camillus is seen by many modern historians as an addition to the story since he was not mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius, another ancient Greek historian. Diodorus said that the Gauls were defeated at the Trausian Plain, an unidentified location, by an Etruscan army when they were on the way back from southern Italy. Strabo wrote that they were defeated by Caere (the Etruscan city, allied to Rome, to which the Vestal priestesses had fled) and that the Caerites recovered Rome&#x27;s ransomed gold. That runs counter to the notion that Camillus stopped the payment of a ransom to the Senones. As has been noted, Plutarch wrote that Aristotle said Rome was saved by &quot;a certain Lucius&quot;. That could be Lucius Albinus, who was said to have given the priestesses a lift to Caere. The role of Caere in the saga of the Gallic sack is unclear, and it may be that it played a more important role than in the Roman tradition.

There is also the question of what the Senones were doing in central Italy. Diodorus Siculus wrote that the Senones were &quot;distressed and eager to move&quot; because they had settled to a place (the ager Gallicus) that was too hot. They armed their younger men and sent them out to seek a territory where they might settle. Therefore, they invaded Etruria, the 30,000 sacked the territory of Clusium. However, Cornell finds that to be unconvincing. Throughout the story, the Senones appear to be a warrior band. There is no mention in any of the accounts of wives and children, who would have been present if the Gauls had been a migrating people in search of land. Cornell thinks that they were mercenaries. A few months after the sack of Rome, Dionysius I of Syracuse, the tyrant of the Greek city of Syracuse, in Sicily, hired Gallic mercenaries for a war in the south of Italy. It may well be that was why the Senones were on their way to the south. The story of their defeat on their way back from the south seems to fit with that hypothesis. It could also be that the Senones went to Clusium because they had been hired by one of two political factions at loggerheads to intervene in political struggles in the city, rather than the romanticised story of Aruns&#x27;s revenge for his wife.

==Roman recovery==
===Rome under attack===
====389–366 BC: Worsening of relations with Latin League and Hernici====
The Gallic sack was a humiliation for Rome and set in motion a series of wars against nearby peoples. Rome, in conjunction with the Latin League, a coalition of other Latin cities, and the Hernici, had spent much of the 5th century fighting against the Volsci and Aequi, who lived to the south, in response to the latter&#x27;s attacks on their territory. Immediately after the sack, there were attacks by the Volsci and the Etruscan city-states in southern Etruria. Rome responded aggressively. That led to a breakdown of her alliances with the Latin League and the Hernici and rebellions by several Latin cities. Rome spent the next 32 years fighting the Volsci, the Etruscans and the rebel Latin cities.

In 389 BC, the Volsci took up arms and encamped near the Latin city of Lanuvium. Camillus defeated them and laid &quot;waste all the Volscian countryside, which forced the Volsci to surrender.&quot; Livy wrote that with this Rome &quot;acquired undisputed control&quot; of the Pomptine Marshes in the southern part of the Volscian territory. However, the Volsci subsequently continued to fight. Camillus then moved against the Aequi who were preparing for war and defeated them, too. The Etruscans captured the Roman colony of Sutrium in southern Etruria and Camillus repelled them. In 388 BC, the Romans laid waste the territory of the Aequi to weaken them and carried out incursions into the territory of the Etruscan city-state of Tarquinii, capturing and destroying Cortuosa and Cobra. In 386 BC the Volscian of the town of Antium gathered an army which included Hernici and Latin forces near Satricum, not far from Antium. A battle with the Romans was stopped by rain, and the Latins and Hernici then returned home. The Volsci retreated to Satricum, which was taken by storm. In 386 BC, the Etruscans seized Sutrium and Nepet, two Roman colonies in southern Etruria. The Romans asked the Latins and Hernici why they did not provide Rome with soldiers, as they were supposed to, under their alliances. Both replied that it was because of &quot;their constant fear of the Volsci.&quot; They also said that their men who had fought with the Volsci had done so of their own volition and not under the orders of their councils. However, it was clear that Rome&#x27;s aggressive actions had caused them to defect and become hostile. In 385 BC, there was another war with the Volsci, who were supported by the rebelling Latins and Hernici as well as the Roman colony of Circeii and Roman colonists from Velitrae. The force was defeated, and most of the prisoners were Latins and Hernici. The Romans planted a colony with 2000 colonists at Satricum.

In 383 BC, the Latin city of Lanuvium rebelled. The Roman senate decided to found a colony at Nepet in southern Etruria and allot land in the Pomptine Marshes to the Roman poor to gain popular support for a war. An epidemic, however, prevented any war. That prompted the Romans at Velitrae and Circeii to sue for pardon, but they were dissuaded by the rebels, who also encouraged pillaging in Roman territory. The Latin city of Praeneste also became rebellious and attacked the territories of the Latin towns of Tusculum, Gabii, and Labici, which were Roman allies. In 382 BC, the Romans attacked and defeated a rebel force in which men from Praeneste almost outnumbered the force of the Roman colonists, near Levitra. The Romans did not attack the town because they were unsure about their success and did not think it was right to exterminate the Roman colony.

Still, in 382 BC, Rome declared war on Praeneste, which joined the Volsci. The joint force took the Roman colony of Satricum despite strong resistance by the Roman colonists. In 381 BC, the Romans levied four legions and marched on Satricum. There was a fierce battle that the Romans won. There were men from Tusculum among the prisoners. After Tusculum broke its alliance with the Romans, Rome declared war on it. However, when the Romans entered its territory, Tusculum did not fight and was granted peace.

In 380 BC, the Praenestines marched into the territory of Gabii and advanced against Rome&#x27;s walls at the Colline Gate and encamped near the River Allia, where the Gauls had defeated Rome. The Romans defeated them and marched into the territory of Praeneste, seizing eight towns under its jurisdiction and then Levitra. Finally, they confronted Praeneste, the heart of the rebellion, which surrendered. In 378 BC, the Volsci ravaged the borders of Roman territory. The Romans sent an army to Antium on the coast and another to Electra and the mountains and applied a scorched earth policy. In 377 BC, a joint Latin and Volscian force encamped near Satricum. The Romans levied three armies: one was a reserve legion, one defended the city and the third, the largest, marched on Satricum. The enemy was routed and fled to Antium. A quarrel now broke out between the Initiates and the Latins. The former were inclined to give up, but the latter did not and left. The Initiates surrendered their city and lands. The Latins burned Satricum in revenge. Then, they attacked Tusculum, which was rescued by the Romans.

In 370 BC, the Roman colonists of Velitrae made several incursions into Roman territory and besieged Tusculum, knowing that Rome did not have an army because the plebeian tribunes had paralysed the Roman state. Thereafter, the tribunes allowed the election of heads of state and the levy of an army, which drove the rebels from Tusculum and laid a protracted siege on Levitra. Livy did not state when it ended, but it must have been in 366 BC. In 367 BC, the rebels arrived in Latium. An ageing Camillus defeated them near the Alban Hills, and most of the rebels then fled to Apulia.

====366–358 BC: End of hostilities with Latins and Hernici====
In 366, there were reports of defection of the Hernici. In 362, Rome declared war on them. The Romans were ambushed and routed. The consul who led the army died in the battle, and the Hernici surrounded the Roman camp. The Romans sent a relief force and the Hernici were defeated in a tough battle. In 361, the Romans seized Ferentinum, a town of the Hernici. When they were on their way back, the people of the Latin city of Tibur shut the city gates on them. In 360, the Gauls encamped near the River Anio. After some skirmishes, the conflict was resolved by single combat between Titus Manlius and a Gaul, which the former won. The Gauls left, went to Tibur, and allied with it, receiving supplies from the city. Then, the Gauls went on to Campania. In 360 BC the Romans attacked Tibur, prompting the Gauls to return to render aid. They then ravaged the territories of Labici, Tusculum, and Alba Longa. The Romans kept an army at Tusculum and fought the Gauls with another one, not far from Rome&#x27;s Colline gate. After a tough battle, the Gauls went to Tibur again. The two allies were defeated by the two Roman armies. A third Roman army defeated the Hernici in a major battle. In 359, a small force from Tibur arrived at the walls of Rome, but it was repelled easily. In 358, the Etruscan city of Tarquinii was plundered by Roman territory by Etruria. The Romans levied an army against them and one against the Hernici.

That year, the war with the Latins and Hernici ended. Peace with the Latins was prompted by rumours of a Gallic war. The Latin League renewed the alliance with Rome they had made in 493 (the foedus Cassianum), which had lapsed shortly after the Gallic sack of Rome and the subsequent rebellions by several Latin cities. The Latin League provided Rome with soldiers. Thus, the Gauls were the cause of both the falling out between these two parties after the sack of Rome and their reconciliation in 358. The Gauls went to Praeneste and encamped near Pedum. The Roman commander, Gaius Sulpicius, delayed engaging in battle to wear down an enemy which had no food supplies in unfriendly territory and &quot;whose strength and courage lay wholly in attacking, and languished as soon as there came a slight delay.&quot; Eventually, the Gauls provoked a battle, which the Romans won. Another Roman army defeated the Hernici and reduced them to subjection. Meanwhile, a third Roman army was defeated by Tarquinii, which killed 307 captured Roman soldiers as a sacrifice. The city of Falerii had sided with Tarquinii but refused to hand over Roman soldiers who had fled there from the battle. Velitrae and the Volscian city of Privernum devastated the Roman fields with sudden raids.

====357–345 BC: Further conflict in region====
Although the conflict with the Latin league and the Hernici had ended, there were still troubles with the Volsci, Tibur, and the Etruscans. In 357, Rome ravaged the territory of Privernum and then attacked the city, which surrendered. In 356, a Roman army pushed a force from Tibur into their city and pillaged its fields. Another army was routed by Tarquinii and Falerii. A coalition of Etruscan city-states, led by the two cities, advanced to the salt works. The Romans crossed the River Tiber on rafts and seized the enemy camp by surprise, captured 8000 prisoners, and drove the Etruscans out of the Roman territory. In 354, the Romans seized Empulum which was in the territory of Tibur and ravaged lands that belonged to Tarquinii. In 353, they took Sassula, which also belonged to Tibur and surrendered. They also routed the army of Tarquinii, taking many prisoners. They picked 158 noblemen among them, took them to Rome, scourged them, and beheaded them in revenge for the Romans who had been sacrificed by the Tarquinenses. In 353, the Etruscan city of Caere, which had helped Rome during the Gallic sack of Rome, allied with Tarquinii. The Etruscans pillaged the area near the salt works and took their booty in the territory of Caere. The Volsci attacked Roman territory. Caere sent envoys to Rome to beg forgiveness, claiming that it was some country people who joined the pillaging and that the city had not prepared for war. Rome accepted peace and granted a hundred-year truce. The Romans turned their attention to Falerii. They did not encounter any armies and pillaged the countryside, sparing the towns.

In 350, there were troubles with the Gauls and a Greek fleet. A huge army of Gauls had encamped in Latium. The Romans levied an army of four legions led by a consul and a praetor. They encamped at a height close to the Gallic camp and then defeated them. The Roman consul, who was wounded, did not pursue the fugitives, who fled to the Alban Hills. In 349, the Gauls came down from the hills and ravaged the coastal plain. The Greeks carried out naval attacks on the coast from the mouth of the Tiber to Antium. The Gauls and the Greeks happened to encounter one another and a battle ensued, and the former then withdrew to their camp and the latter to their ships. The Latin League refused to provide Rome with soldiers. The Romans enlisted men everywhere in their territory, including the countryside, and levied ten legions with 4200 infantry each. One of the two consuls died, and the other consul took sole charge of the war. He left two legions in the city to defend it and shared the command of the other eight with a praetor, who was put in charge of preventing the Greeks from landing. The consul encamped in the Pomptine Marshes. He aimed to prevent the Gauls from obtaining their sustenance through plunder. There was single combat between a Gaul and a Roman, which the latter won. That was followed by a battle, which the Romans won. The Gauls scattered among the Volsci, and some of them went to Etruria and others to Apulia. The consuls then joined the other legions to deal with the Greek fleet. There was no battle, and the Greeks were kept offshore. Eventually, the Greeks ran out of water and left.

In 348 and 347, there was peace. In 346, the Volsci of the city of Antium sent envoys to the cities of the Latins to try to stir up a war. The Romans attacked Satricum, which the Volsci had rebuilt two years earlier. They defeated an army of Initiates and other Volsci, which had been levied in advance, and fled to Satricum. The Romans besieged the town, 4000 of the enemy surrendered, and the victorious army burned down the town. In 345, the Aurunci carried out an unexpected raid. It was feared that it was a joint design with the Latin League. The Romans defeated the Aurunci in a single battle, made a surprise attack on the Volsci, and seized the town of Sora.

===Modern evaluations of conflicts===
Some modern historians follow Karl Julius Beloch, who dismissed the Roman victories soon after the sack. One reason is that they are not mentioned by the Greek historians Diodorus Siculus and Polybius. The other is the assumption that Rome had been damaged too much to be so successful militarily.

Livy said that the city was burnt and that it then developed a haphazard layout because it was rebuilt hastily. However, Cornell notes that Diodorus Siculus and Polybius made only scarce references to the period. He also disputes the extent of the damage suffered by Rome. He points out that there is no archaeological trace of the damage to the sack. Signs of burning that were thought to be dated to this event have subsequently been dated to the rebellion that had brought down the Roman monarchy more than a century earlier. Cornell thinks that the Senones ransacked the city but were interested only in the booty, left most of the buildings alone, and went after they had been bought off. It was common for the layout of ancient cities to be haphazard. He adds that Rome&#x27;s recovery was aided by cementing the newly-conquered territory of Veii by granting its inhabitants citizenship without the right to vote and by a strengthening of the alliance with Caere, which had helped Rome during the Gallic sack. After the initial setback and attacks, Rome resumed its expansionism of the late 5th and early 4th centuries.

===Rome rebuilds its city walls===
A few years after the sack, Rome began to build new city walls using ashlar masonry from a quarry in the territory of Veii. It was a huge undertaking as the wall was 11  km (7  mi) long. The original wall had been built in Cappellaccio tuff, the local stone, which was of rather poor quality because it is a quite friable stone. The wall was rebuilt with a type of yellow tuff, named Grotta Oscura (after its main quarry), which was of much better quality, in the territory of Veii. Thus, the acquisition of Veii provided Rome with better masonry for construction. However, the new rock was harder and thus more difficult to work.

===Fear of Gauls===
The Gallic sack led to a long-lasting and profound fear of the Gauls in Rome. In 350 and 349 BC, unspecified Gauls attacked Latium. They were probably marauding raids. On the second occasion, Marcus Valerius Corvus was said to have fought a duel with a Gallic champion. Polybius said that Rome made a peace with the Gauls, who did not return for 30 years. Despite Rome defeating the Senones in the Battle of Sentinum (295) during the Third Samnite War (298-290), popular fear of Gauls persisted. In 228, 216, and 114 fears of Gallic attacks led to the Romans performing human sacrifices by burying alive a pair of Gauls and a pair of Greeks even though human sacrifice was not a Roman custom. Presumably, it was done to avert the danger of another Gallic disaster.

==Legend about Brennus==
The &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, a medieval work of fiction written c. 1136 by Geoffrey of Monmouth on the legendary kings of Britain, depicts Brennus as leading both Britons and Gauls. He besieges Rome for three days until his brother comes to aid in the invasion. The Romans defend the city for many days and are successful in repelling the invaders. Finally, the two consuls don armour and join the men defending the city. They push the invaders back, but Belinus can reform the lines and stop the attacks. Brennus and Belinus continue forward until the walls are breached and the Britons and Gauls invade the city. According to the story, Brennus stayed in Rome and ruled ruthlessly for the rest of his days.

<text>Baron Wolfgang von Strucker () is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. A former Nazi officer, he is one of the leaders of the Hydra terrorist organization, and the archenemy of Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. He has also come into conflict with the Avengers, and the interests of the United States, and is thus a fugitive. He has been physically augmented to be nearly ageless. While Strucker has been seemingly killed in the past, he returned to plague the world with schemes of world domination and genocide, time and time again.

The character has appeared in several media adaptations, including television series and video games. Strucker was portrayed by Campbell Lane in the 1998 TV film, &quot;Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, by Thomas Kretschmann in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014) and &quot;&quot; (2015), and by Joey Defore as a teenager in the television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, also set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==Publication history==
Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appears in &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot; #5 (1964).

==Fictional character biography==
Born in the late 19th century to a Prussian noble family who had relocated to Strucker Castle in Bavaria following the Franco-Prussian War, Wolfgang von Strucker became a Heidelberg fencing champion and was disfigured by facial scars.

Strucker fought for Germany during World War I, during which he first encountered the jewel &quot;Momentary Princess&quot;, which was fated to appear and disappear at regular intervals of time. Wolfgang pursued the jewel in the decades that followed.

When Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany in 1933, Baron Strucker joined the Nazi Party, becoming infamous in the following years. In 1936, he and Geist, one of Hitler&#x27;s top men, allied themselves with the Egyptian mentalist Amahl Farouk (secretly the Shadow King) in an attempt to dispute the lineage of England&#x27;s royal family and install a new king who would be sympathetic to the Nazis. Their plot was thwarted by the Canadian adventurer Logan and the time-traveling members of Excalibur, Kitty Pryde and Phoenix.

In 1937, German Intelligence agent Strucker was sent to the United States to assassinate Senator Fulton, but he was foiled by brigand-for-hire Dominic Fortune.

===World War II===
As World War II began, Strucker was appointed wing commander of the Death&#x27;s Head Squadron by Hitler, and, in 1941, he was sent to Madripoor to help the Hand ninja cult transform young Natasha Romanova into their master assassin, only to be defeated by Logan (yet to acquire the adamantium skeleton which would transform into Wolverine), Captain America, and Ivan Petrovitch. Later in 1941, Strucker invaded Latveria, seeking to use the Sturm-Fånger (&quot;Storm-Catcher&quot;) to control cosmic energies; the device was wrecked by time-traveling members of X-Force.

After the United States entered the war, the First Attack Squad of Able Company (the Howling Commandos) became a constant thorn in the Nazis&#x27; side, and Hitler turned to Strucker, ordering him to publicly humiliate the Howlers&#x27; leader Nick Fury. Strucker challenged Fury to a duel on the island of Norsehaven, and Fury violated direct orders to meet Strucker and satisfy his pride. Before their duel with plywood swords, Strucker offered Fury a toast, and secretly drugged Fury&#x27;s drink. As they fought, Strucker was surprised to find that despite his superior swordsmanship and the effects of the drug, Fury was a tenacious foe, but Fury finally succumbed to the drug&#x27;s effects. Strucker had the event recorded and sent back to Germany as propaganda material to destroy Fury&#x27;s reputation.

Hitler demanded that Strucker capture the Howlers so they could be executed in Berlin. Strucker assembled the Blitzkrieg Squad, who could match each of the Howlers skill for skill, but the Howlers defeated them at every turn. Strucker also led the Blitzkrieg Squad to England to assassinate Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, but they were foiled by the Invaders. Strucker finally abandoned the Blitzkrieg Squad, which was later led by Colonel Klaue.

While vacationing in Berlin, Strucker witnessed the Asgardian Thor&#x27;s attack on the Chancellery, after which Strucker followed a bandaged man through a portal in space. Realizing he had traveled decades into the future, Strucker stole some history books about the end of World War II. He encountered the time machine&#x27;s creator Doctor Doom, who allowed him to return to the past, not believing that Strucker could win the war even with the knowledge he had obtained.

Tiring of Strucker&#x27;s failures, Hitler assigned him to topple the resistance in the French town of Cherbeaux, or else destroy the town. Strucker rounded up the resistance to send them to camps to avoid having to destroy the town, but the Howling Commandos derailed his train, freeing the captives. Hitler demanded that Strucker destroy the town, and Strucker set the explosives, but then came face-to-face with Fury, who had rigged an explosive powerful enough to kill Strucker. Caught in a stalemate, Strucker agreed to let the people of Cherbeaux evacuate so that he and Fury could battle again. When the evacuation was complete, Strucker and Fury fought while Cherbeaux was destroyed around them, and Fury lost Strucker in the upheaval. For allowing the evacuation of Cherbeaux, Hitler had Strucker marked for death by the Gestapo.

Strucker escaped Germany because of the Red Skull, Hitler&#x27;s right-hand man, who foresaw Hitler&#x27;s fall, and wanted an alternative power base. The Red Skull sent Strucker to Japan to form this organization, but Strucker intended to run it for himself. In Japan, Strucker joined forces with the Hand and an underground subversive movement which later became Hydra where he received help from Arnim Zola into establishing it. Strucker was instrumental in Hydra&#x27;s earliest raids on war plants to supply their troops, and finally confronted the Supreme Hydra, claiming that as the organization&#x27;s true mastermind, he should be Hydra&#x27;s leader. The Supreme Hydra refused and shot him, but Strucker had worn a bulletproof vest, and slew the Supreme Hydra, claiming his title. Strucker also slew the jonin (leader) of the Hand in single combat, severing ties with the Hand to prevent Hydra agents from being seduced by promises of the dark power of the demonic Beast of the Hand.

Strucker moved Hydra&#x27;s operations to a private island in the Pacific, named Hydra Island. After he used an undetectable &quot;phantom&quot; submarine to assault allied and Japanese ships, Hydra Island was investigated by the allies&#x27; Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders, and the Japanese Samurai Squad. Captain Savage and the others managed to overcome Hydra&#x27;s forces, and Strucker was forced to detonate the island. With Hydra&#x27;s plans temporarily waylaid, Strucker was forced to return to Germany.

To regain Hitler&#x27;s favor, Strucker subjected Fury to a hallucinogenic drug in Africa, offering the formula to Hitler if it proved successful in the field. Fury was overcome by the hallucinations, but the Howlers rescued him, enabling his recovery. Ever more uncomfortable with the progress of the war, Strucker continued to operate Hydra from the shadows while pretending to be a loyal Nazi, secretly funneling Hitler&#x27;s resources into his own operation. He also obtained the Dragon of Death, a powerful Japanese submarine, and made it Hydra&#x27;s new mobile headquarters. Using his knowledge of the future, Strucker attempted to complete &quot;Uranverein&quot;, a nuclear weapons project, before the United States, sending Hydra agents to obtain the materials. Learning of this plot, the Invaders ultimately scuttled the Dragon, again delaying Strucker&#x27;s plans, and during the clash Strucker lost the books he had brought from the future. It is also likely that because of this scheme that Strucker inadvertently caused a bootstrap paradox that lead to the establishment of the United States&#x27; Manhattan Project which builds the atomic bombs and the eventual nuclear proliferation in the first place.

In 1944, Strucker encountered the Gnobians, a benevolent race of empathic extraterrestrials who had crashed near Gruenstadt. Realizing what their technology could do for Hydra, Strucker befriended the naïve creatures and killed the population of Gruenstadt to cover his tracks. The Howlers arrived, too late to prevent the tragedy, but fatally wounded Strucker. The Gnobians healed Strucker with their powers, but they went insane from absorbing some of his hate-filled psyche in the process. Strucker fled their crashed ship, taking discs of their information to his scientists. As Germany fell in 1945, Strucker had the Nazis&#x27; two greatest superhumans Master Man and Warrior Woman placed into suspended animation in opposite sides of Berlin to await later revival. Strucker also gave the Red Skull the gas used to preserve them, and it also preserved the Skull when he was buried alive in his bunker during a battle with Captain America.

Avoiding prosecution for war crimes, Baron Strucker had his scientists provide him with age-retarding serum so he could personally oversee Hydra&#x27;s progress for decades to come. He and the Baroness Adelicia Von Krupp once captured the CIA&#x27;s Agent Ten, who proved to be Strucker&#x27;s old enemy Logan, but Logan was rescued by CIA agents Richard and Mary Parker.

Needing more finances for Hydra, Strucker abducted Gabrielle Haller, who had a map leading to a fortune in lost Nazi gold hidden within her mind, but Haller was defended by her friends, the mutants Charles Xavier and Erik Magnus, and Magnus took the gold for his own purposes.

Strucker married more than once in the years that followed resulting in a son named Werner, who resisted his father&#x27;s influence, and twins Andrea and Andreas, who were genetically altered by Hydra scientists and developed super powers later in life. Strucker rebuilt Hydra Island, but concealed his role in the organization by using a front called &quot;THEM&quot;, in which he was Grand Imperator. In this role, he assigned Arnold Brown to be his Imperial Hydra, supposedly the true master of Hydra. Brown&#x27;s rule of Hydra ended when he was overcome by S.H.I.E.L.D., an espionage organization led by Nick Fury and designed to thwart Hydra, and the unmasked Brown was mistakenly shot by his own men as Hydra crumbled about him. THEM also found and revived the long-lost Red Skull, but Strucker finally abandoned THEM when the scientific research arm of Hydra and another branch splintered away to become A.I.M. and the Secret Empire, respectively.

===Death===
Strucker continued to conceal his identity, acting as Don Antonio Caballero, Emir Ali Bey, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent John Bronson. He finally revealed himself as Hydra&#x27;s true leader when he prepared to unleash the Death Spore bomb from Hydra Island. Invading the island, Nick Fury used masks to trick Strucker&#x27;s men into shooting their leader. In a panic, Strucker ran into a chamber where nuclear processes were taking place, and was immediately incinerated. Soon afterwards, Fury set the Death Spore bomb to explode within Hydra Island&#x27;s protective dome designed to keep the island safe from the spores, eradicating all Hydra personnel within.

===Life Model Decoy===
In the ensuing years, the roboticist Machinesmith built a robot duplicate of Strucker, using it to test the abilities and morality of Captain America. The robot fooled even S.H.I.E.L.D. into thinking they had captured the real Strucker. Strucker also lived on in the form of several different android LMDs (Life Model Decoy) based on his mind; one was activated on Hydra Island after Strucker&#x27;s death and believed itself to be the true Strucker, finally meeting its doom battling Captain America, Fury, and the one-time Howling Commandos. Another tricked Canada&#x27;s Department H into selling Hydra the battle-suit worn by their hero Guardian. The most destructive was the Deltite, an LMD Strucker had planted within S.H.I.E.L.D. to tear the organization apart, and ultimately wound up running S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra simultaneously, playing the two against each other. By the time the Deltite was finally revealed and destroyed, it had managed to sow distrust throughout S.H.I.E.L.D., and killed many agents, leading Fury to disband the organization.

===Resurrection===
Hydra suffered without Strucker&#x27;s leadership, and the Red Skull championed an effort to bring the Baron back, providing a distraction to occupy Fury&#x27;s newly-rebuilt S.H.I.E.L.D. while Hydra scientists found Strucker&#x27;s body and sacrificed their lives to revive him with the Death Spore bonded to his form.

===&quot;Thunderbolts&quot;===
Strucker places the hero Abner Jenkins of the Thunderbolts into his debt by funding his team, and pits the team against threats he helped fund, including the Wrecking Crew, Fathom Five, and the Great Game.

Gorgon and Elsbeth stage a coup of Hydra and kill Strucker. This Strucker was subsequently revealed to be a clone, as the real Strucker was rescued and kept in stasis before being freed by the Swordsman (who turned out to be his son, Andreas) and then Baron Helmut Zemo. Strucker agreed to work with Zemo in his grand plan to take over the world and left together. Helmut Zemo is also responsible for the murder of Strucker&#x27;s daughter Andrea.

===Secret Invasion===
During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Strucker is attacked by Skrulls who are attempting to take over Hydra. However, he is able to defeat them and destroys his own headquarters in order to eliminate any remaining invaders. Strucker also reveals that he no longer adheres to orthodox Nazi beliefs, since he does not wish to &quot;cleanse&quot; the world, but simply to rule it.

===Dark Reign===
During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Strucker&#x27;s longtime nemesis, Nick Fury, discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is, and always has been, controlled by Hydra. Strucker seems happy finding this out saying that &quot;We&#x27;ve been dancing to the melody for so long, and finally you hear it too&quot;. Strucker calls forth all Hydra leaders (Kraken, Viper, Madame Hydra, and Hive), and resurrects the Gorgon for the purpose of &quot;letting the world become aware of Hydra&#x27;s true nature&quot;. However, Nick Fury was interfering in von Strucker&#x27;s plans, so Strucker enlists the help of Norman Osborn, director of the corrupt H.A.M.M.E.R. agency, to take care of his nemesis. The news that Osborn had recently murdered his son Andreas had little impact on Strucker, who calmly declared that he now owed Osborn &quot;two favors&quot;.

It is revealed that, at some point in the past, Baron Strucker, Nick Fury, and Hand grandmaster Soji Soma had a meeting with representatives of the organization Leviathan.

Along with Nick Fury, Baron Strucker was captured by the Kraken. It was revealed that not only was Kraken really Nick Fury&#x27;s presumably dead half-brother Jake Fury (working with Nick the entire time), but it was revealed to a disbelieving Strucker that in fact S.H.I.E.L.D. had been controlling Hydra all along. Before being able to speak his final words, Nick Fury shot him in the head.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; branding, Strucker eventually emerges alive minus an eye and replaced with a prosthetic lens. He is described as no longer being Hydra&#x27;s leader, though shown to still be heavily involved in international subversive dealings. In addition, a revived Andrea and Andreas mentioned that their father &quot;took care&quot; of their return from the dead when they were asked how they were revived.

After the defeat of the Secret Empire, Strucker is given praise as a national hero for leading the defeat of multiple Hydra splinter groups. He also appears as a member of the Power Elite.

==Powers and abilities==
Baron Strucker is a highly intelligent man in peak human physical condition. He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, swordsman, and marksman. He is also a consummate military strategist and spy, and a master of disguise and excellent actor. He carries a sword and traditional firearms, but also wears the Satan Claw on his right hand: this metal gauntlet amplifies his strength and emits powerful electrical shocks. Strucker also uses serums developed by Hydra, enabling him to maintain his physical vigor at its height and retard his aging process, so that physically he remains the same, despite his advanced age.

Exposure to his Death Spore has bonded Strucker&#x27;s DNA with the Death Spore, enabling him to be revived after seemingly being killed by gunshot wounds and radiation poisoning. Strucker can now release the Death Spore virus from his body at will, killing his victims nearly instantly. If Strucker is killed, the Death Spore viruses will allegedly be set free from his body and risk infecting the entire Earth.

<text>The Portsmouth Block Mills form part of the Portsmouth Dockyard at Portsmouth, Hampshire, England, and were built during the Napoleonic Wars to supply the British Royal Navy with pulley blocks. They started the age of mass-production using all-metal machine tools (designed chiefly by Marc Isambard Brunel), and are regarded as one of the seminal buildings of the British Industrial Revolution. They are also the site of the first stationary steam engines used by the Admiralty.

Since 2003 English Heritage has been undertaking a detailed survey of the buildings and the records relating to the machines.

==Development of Portsmouth Dockyard==

The Royal Navy had evolved with Britain&#x27;s development by the middle of the eighteenth century into what has been described as the greatest industrial power in the western world. The Admiralty and Navy Board began a programme of modernisation of dockyards at Portsmouth and Plymouth such that by the start of the war with Revolutionary France they possessed the most up-to-date fleet facilities in Europe.

The dock system at Portsmouth has its origins in the work of Edmund Dummer in the 1690s. He constructed a series of basins and wet and dry docks. Alterations were made to these in the course of the eighteenth century. One of the basins had become redundant by 1770 and it was proposed to use this as a sump into which all the water from the other facilities could drain. The water was pumped out by a series of horse-operated chain pumps.

In 1795, Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham was appointed by the Admiralty, the first (and only) Inspector General of Naval Works with the task of continuing this modernisation, and in particular the introduction of steam power and mechanising the production processes in the dockyard. His office employed several specialists as his assistants — mechanists (engineers), draughtsmen, architects, chemists, clerks, and others. The Inspector General&#x27;s office was responsible for the introduction at Portsmouth of a plant for the rolling of copper plates for sheathing ship&#x27;s hulls and for forging-mills for the production of metal parts used in the construction of vessels. They also introduced similar modernisation at the other Naval dockyards in conjunction with M I Brunel and Maudslay.

By 1797 work had started on building additional dry docks and on deepening the basins, and Bentham realised that the existing drainage system would not cope with the increased demand. He installed a steam engine designed by a member of his staff, James Sadler, in 1798 which, as well as working the chain pumps, drove woodworking machinery and a pump to take water from a well round the dockyard for fire-fighting purposes. This well was some away and the pumps operated by a horizontal reciprocating wooden spear housed in a tunnel running from the engine house to the top of the well. The Sadler engine was a house-built table engine installed in a single-storey engine house with integral boiler; it replaced one of the horse-drives to the chain pumps. This engine was replaced in 1807 in the same house by another, more powerful, table engine made by Fenton, Murray and Wood of Leeds and, in turn, in 1830 by a Maudslay beam engine.

In 1800 a Boulton and Watt beam engine was ordered as back-up and was housed in a three-storey engine house in line with the Sadler engine house. This engine was replaced in 1837 by another engine made by James Watt and Co.

Space was very tight and expansion of manufacturing facilities was not possible, so by 1802 the drainage basin was filled with two tiers of brick vaults—the lower layer to act as the reservoir, the upper layer as storage, and the roof of the latter being level with the surrounding land, so creating more space. This allowed the construction of two parallel ranges of three-storey wood mills, the southern to incorporate both engine houses and their chimney stacks, the chain pumps and some wood working machinery. The northern range was directly over the vaults and was to house more woodworking machinery. The buildings were designed by Samuel Bunce, the architect of Bentham&#x27;s staff.

While the vaults were under construction Bentham was ordering woodworking machinery of his own design, mostly up-and-down saws and circular saws. These were fitted-up in both ranges, the power to drive them being transmitted from the engines to the north range by underdrives through the upper layer of vaults, and then by vertical shafts to the upper floors of the buildings. The final drives to the machines was by flat belts running on pulleys.

This machinery was planned to cut timber for the numerous smaller parts used in shipbuilding, especially joinery, which had previously been cut by hand, such as components for tables and benches, as well as small turned goods like belaying pins. There is evidence that he had developed a rotary wood-planing machine but details of this are obscure. There is also evidence that the complex housed a pipe boring machine, whereby straight elm trees were bored out for pump dales. These could be up to long and were fitted through the decks of a vessel to pump seawater to the deck. There was a machine for making treenails—long wooden dowels used for fixing wooden parts of a ship together.

==Blocks==

The Royal Navy used large numbers of blocks, which were all hand-made by contractors. Their quality was not consistent, the supply problematic and they were expensive. A typical ship of the line needed about 1000 blocks of different sizes, and in the course of the year the Navy required over 100,000. Bentham had devised some machines for making blocks, but did not develop them and details of how they worked are now obscure. In 1802 Marc Isambard Brunel proposed to the Admiralty a system of making blocks using machinery he had patented. Bentham appreciated the superiority of Brunel&#x27;s system and in August 1802 he was authorised by the Admiralty to proceed.

There were three series of block-making machines, each designed to make a range of block sizes. They were laid out to allow a production line, so each stage of the work progressed to the next in a natural flow. The yard between the two wood mill buildings was walled-off and roofed to form a new workshop to house the block-making machines.
The first set, for medium blocks, was installed in January 1803, the second set for smaller blocks in May 1803, and the third set for large blocks in March 1805. There were numerous changes of layout and some modification of the plant until in September 1807 the plant was felt able to fulfil all the needs of the Navy: 130,000 blocks were produced in 1808.

==The block-making processes using the machines==

The machines were of 22 types and totalled 45. They were driven by two steam engines. The machines included circular saws, pin turning machines and morticing machines. With these machines 10 men could produce as many blocks as 110 skilled craftsmen.

A pulley-block has four parts: the shell, the sheave, the pin for locating the latter in the shell and a metal bush, or coak, inserted into the sheave to save wear between it and the pin. Blocks can vary in size and in the number of sheaves.

The process of making the shells

* Cut slices from the trunk of a tree, and from these slices by means of the circular saws cut rectangular blocks from which the shells were manufactured.
* Bore a hole in the block for the pin, and at right angles to this a hole or holes to receive the morticing chisels (depending on the number of mortices). The clamp used to hold the block at the same time indented locating points by which the blocks were secured in the later machines, thus ensuring consistent location and measurement in the subsequent processes.
* Mortice the blocks by a self-acting machine. The morticing chisel reciprocated vertically, and at the same time the vice gripping the block was gradually moved each cut. Once the length of the mortice had been cut the machine automatically stopped to allow the block to be replaced with a new one.
* Cut the corners off the block by a circular saw with angled guides.
* Shape the four faces of the blocks to a shallow curve. This was done by a machine where a number of blocks were clamped in the periphery of a revolving wheel. The cutter was swept in a curve across the faces of the blocks as they rotated. The radius of the curve was controlled by a former. After each cut the blocks were turned 90 degrees to bring up a new face.
* Each block was then placed in a machine which scored a shallow groove, by means of a revolving cutter, to give a location for the securing ropes.

The process of making the sheaves

* Cut a slice across a trunk of Lignum Vitae. The machine for this allowed the log to be rotated at the same time as the circular saw operated, ensuring that an equal thickness was maintained. The position of the log for each new cut was controlled by a leadscrew ensuring great accuracy.
* Make a circular disc from this slice by means of a rounding saw, which simultaneously bored out the middle and shaped the outer edge.
* Mill out from each face a profile to take the outer face of the coak
* The coak was inserted into the sheave, and a retaining ring rivetted to keep it in place.
* Broach out the hole in the coak to the size of the requisite pin.
* The finished sheave was faced-off on both sides in a special lathe, and the rope groove was machined on the edge.

The process of making the pins

* The pin blanks were forged slightly oversize with a square left on one end.
* They were turned to size on the circular part in a special lathe.
* They were given a burnished finish between hardened dies
* One source says they were then tinned to preserve them from rust.

The process of making the metal coaks

* These were cast in bell-metal and the mould left grease-retaining grooves in the inner bore. One end of the coak had a flange and a loose ring was supplied for the other end, together these parts gave a seating for the rivets which fixed the coak to the sheave.

Assembly process

* The shells were smoothed by hand with a spokeshave and then the sheave and pin assembled. They were stored in the Block Mills and issued as demanded.

==Significant features==
These machines utilised several features for the first time which have since become commonplace in machine design.

* The boring operation indented gauging points in the wooden blocks which the clamps of the later machines used to locate the blocks precisely. This meant that positioning of the block in later processes ensured accurate location in relation to the tool working on it.
* Several of the machines had cone clutches.
* Brunel used detachable tool bits held in tool holders very similar to those use now on general purpose lathes.
* Expanding collet chucks were used to locate the sheaves by gripping the internal bore, during certain operations.
* Two-jaw gripping chucks were used on some machines. These were precursors of the three-jaw chucks used on lathes today.
* The morticing machines could be set to stop automatically once the operation was finished.
* interchangeability of the sheaves and pins was possible, since they were not married to a particular shell.
* The work-flow is perhaps best described as batch production, because of the range of block sizes demanded. But it was basically a production-line system, nevertheless. This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America.
*The entire system was designed to be worked by labourers and not apprentice-trained craftsmen. Each man was trained to operate two or more machines and could be moved round the plant as required.

==The manufacture of the block-making machines==
Brunel&#x27;s patent specification shows wooden framed machines, which, while they show many of the principles of the machines actually installed bear little resemblance to the final designs. The machines submitted by Brunel to the Admiralty for evaluation are now in the National Maritime Museum. Once the contract with the Admiralty had been placed Bentham engaged Henry Maudslay to make them, and it is clear the final designs had considerable input from Bentham, Maudslay, Simon Goodrich, (mechanician to the Navy board) as well as Brunel himself. Due to Bentham&#x27;s absence in Russia, it was Goodrich who actually brought the block mills into full production. Brunel&#x27;s payment was based on the saving the Navy made with the new system.

These machines were almost entirely hand made, the only machine tools used being lathes to machine circular parts, and drilling machines for boring small holes. At that time there were no milling, planing or shaping machines, and all flat surfaces were made by hand chipping, filing and scraping. There is evidence that the grinding of flats was also done to get near-precision finishes. Each nut was made to fit its matching bolt and were numbered to ensure they were replaced correctly. This was before the days of interchangeability, of course. The materials used were cast and wrought iron, brass and gun metal. The use of metal throughout their construction greatly improved their rigidity and accuracy which became the standard for later machine tool manufacture.

==Publicity==
These machines and the block mills attracted an enormous amount of interest from the time of their erection, ranging from Admiral Lord Nelson on the morning of the day he embarked from Portsmouth for the Battle of Trafalgar on 1805, to the Princess Victoria at the age of 12, as part of her education. Even during the time of the Napoleonic Wars, until 1815 there was a stream of foreign dignitaries and military men wishing to learn. The machines were fully described and illustrated in the &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot; (1811), &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot;, (1812), the supplement to the 4th edition of&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1817) and the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot;. Later encyclopaedias such as &quot;Tomlinson&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; and the &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot; derived their accounts from these earlier publications.

These accounts concentrated almost entirely on the blockmaking machinery, and ignored the saw-milling side of the mills, and in consequence modern commentators have not discussed this aspect of the Block Mills. The sawmills were important since Brunel was enabled to develop his ideas which he employed later in his private veneer mill at Battersea, and the Royal Navy sawmills at Woolwich Dockyard and Chatham Dockyard, as well as mills he designed for private concerns, such as Borthwick&#x27;s at Leith in Scotland.

==Later history==

The Block Mills have remained in constant Navy occupation ever since and in consequence are not open to the public. Manufacture of blocks using these machines naturally declined over the years, production finally stopping in the 1960s, but some of the original machines, part of the transmission drives and the engine-house shells still survive in the buildings. The National Museum of Science and Industry, London, has a selection of machines, donated by the Admiralty between 1933 and 1951, and others are on display in the Dockyard Apprentice Museum at Portsmouth. Several websites claim that the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. also has machines from Portsmouth: this is a myth, according to the Institution.

The Block Mills have not been in use for many years, although a lot of the original pulley systems remain in situ, albeit in a poor state of repair. The building is also in a poor state of repair and is a high priority for both English Heritage and the Ministry of Defence. As of 2006 a project is under way to ensure the building and contents are preserved, if not restored.

<text>Wolfgang Clement (7 July 194027 September 2020) was a German politician and a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He was the 7th Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 27 May 1998 to 22 October 2002 and Federal Minister of Economics and Labour from 2002 to 2005. He was an Honorary Member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

He was known for being one of the architects of the Agenda 2010 labor market reforms under chancellor Gerhard Schröder in the early 2000s. He was also credited with the merger of the federal ministry of economics and labor and the Hartz I through IV labor market reforms. The labor and welfare reforms have been credited with reducing unemployment and contributing to Germany&#x27;s growth years. However, the reforms have been a divisive topic and created a lasting rift between the leftists and the centrists at the SPD.

==Education and career==
Clement was born on 7 July 1940 in Bochum, North Rhine-Westphalia, and was the son of a bricklayer. He completed his schooling &quot;Abitur&quot; at the Graf-Engelbert-Schule in Bochum. He then completed his apprenticeship, &#x27;, at the &#x27; newspaper in Dortmund. He completed his degree in law at the University of Münster in 1965, including clearing the First State Examination, a qualification that allowed him to teach.

Clement later worked as an articled clerk and assistant at the Institute for Trial Law at the University of Marburg. In 1968, he returned to the &quot;Westfälische Rundschau&quot;, first as a political editor, and went onto become the head of political department, and then the deputy editor-in-chief of the newspaper. In 1986, Clement moved to the &quot;Hamburger Morgenpost&quot;, where he remained as editor-in-chief until 1989.

On 12 November 2004, he was presented with an honorary doctorate (Dr. h. c.) by the Ruhr University in Bochum.

==Political career==
Clement started his political career with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1970 and was a member of the party until 2008. Between 1981 and 1986, he was a spokesman for the party&#x27;s federal executive board, and was also the deputy party whip between 1985 and 1986.

In 1989, he was appointed head of the State Chancellery of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) by then NRW Minister President Johannes Rau&#x27;s government. He relinquished this position in favor of the position of State Minister of Special Tasks for NRW after the state elections in 1990. After the 1995 state elections, he was the State Minister of Economics and Small Business, Technology, and Transport.

===Member of State Parliament (1993–2002)===
Clement was a member of the State Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1 October 1993 to 6 November 2002. Between 1994 and 2001, he was also on the SPD State Executive in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), and was the deputy leader of the executive from 1996. He became a member of the SPD federal executive board in 1995, and served until his exit from the party in 2008.

=== Minister President (1998–2002) ===
Clement was elected as Johannes Rau&#x27;s successor as the Minister president of North Rhine-Westphalia on 27 May 1998. With state debts in excess of 130,000 million marks (DEM), he announced drastic cuts and austerity measures including reduction in the size of his own cabinet.

In one of his first moves on 17 June 1998, he announced the merger of the Justice and Interior ministries into one entity. There were doubts if this decision was compatible with the German Constitution, as it was seen by some as a violation of the division of powers. On 9 February 1999, the Constitutional Court of North Rhine-Westphalia ruled that the amalgamation violated the rights of the state parliament. In addition with pressure from coalition partner Bündnis &#x27;90/Die Grünen (the Green party), the merger was canceled. He took on the responsibilities of justice minister for a brief period between 10 and 22 March 1999, before handing the position over to Jochen Dieckmann, who served as the Justice Minister for NRW through the end of the legislature term on 27 June 2000. 
During this period, Clement also served as the deputy chairman of the SPD from December 1999. In the 2000 state elections under his leadership, the SPD received 42.8% of the votes, a drop of 3.2% from the previous election. However, the party was able to form a coalition government with the Green Party. In this coalition, there were debates between Clement and the Green Party&#x27;s Bärbel Höhn, who opposed the continuation of coal mining subsidies and the support for large industrial projects like the Garzweiler surface mine, that were supported by Clement.

After Clement started his term of office as state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia on 27 May 1998, four ministers resigned or left their position early Minister for the Economy Bodo Hombach (moved to Bonn as Minister of the Chancellery), Justice Minister Reinhard Rauball (resigned after a week in position), Minister for European and Federal Affairs (resigned due to tax misdemeanor), and Finance Minister (&quot;&quot; flights misuse). This was also the time when Clement proclaimed that the media industry in NRW would be the &quot;engine of structural change&quot; in the state. The move however, saw limited success. An animation studio in Oberhausen received €50 million in funding as part of this program, but generated limited employment in the end.

In Clement&#x27;s time in office as the state premier of NRW, four parliamentary investigative committees, or &quot;Parlamentarische Untersuchungsausschüsse (PUAs)&quot;, were set up: Review of state enterprises,&quot;&quot; High Definition Oberhausen (HDO – PUA II),&quot;&quot; High Definition Oberhausen (HDO – PUA III),&quot;&quot; and &quot;Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.&quot;

===Federal Minister of Economics and Labour (2002–2005)===

After the 2002 federal elections, Clement was part of the Social Democrats’ team in negotiations with the Green Party on a new coalition agreement for a government under the leadership of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. He gave up his office of Minister-President of NRW on 21 October 2002 and was appointed Federal Minister of Economics and Labour in the new government led by Schröder. In this role, he was taking over the newly created so-called “super ministry” that had been formed by the amalgamation of the Economic and Labour ministries.

The prevailing social democratic thinking in Europe was re-shaped by the Schröder-Blair paper of 1999, a joint working paper between German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, which introduced the &quot;third way&quot; or &quot;Neue Mitte&quot; in that a social democratic future required a comprehensive economization of society with the state withdrawing from the markets and other welfare measures. This represented an abrupt U-turn with respect to the exiting programs of the SPD. In continuation of this thinking, Schröder and Clement, came up with the Agenda 2010 series of reforms where the economy was given more freedom, and labor market reforms starting with the Hartz I through IV programs were introduced. Agenda 2010 was announced as the single largest reform efforts in post-war Germany, and included a set of actions that sought to rethink how the government organized education, social security, and employment. The market reforms relaxed labor market restrictions and reduced social benefits in a bid to boost employment. The reforms emerged to be a divisive topic in Germany with a section of the business community stating that these reforms laid the foundation for the sustainable and employment intensive recovery that took off in 2005. The labor and welfare reforms have been credited with reducing unemployment and contributing to Germany&#x27;s growth years. However, the reforms led to a rift between the left and centrist sections of the SPD, driven by oppositions from the trade unions and social organizations, ultimately resulting in the split Germany&#x27;s center-left, and led to the creation of the far-left party Die Linke and significantly weakened the SPD.

Following the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel was elected Chancellor on 22 November 2005, and Clement was replaced by Michael Glos.

On 31 July 2008, Clement was expelled from the SPD by the &quot;Landesschiedskommission&quot; (i.e. &quot;State arbitration board&quot;) of NRW after making a statement in which he advised against voting for the SPD. Clement went to the superior &quot;Bundesschiedskommission&quot; (&quot;Federal arbitration board&quot;) which subsequently cancelled the verdict on 24 November 2008. On 25 November, Clement announced his decision to leave the party. He went on to support the Free Democratic Party led by Christian Lindner, but did not join the party.

==Life after politics==

After leaving politics, Clement held various paid and unpaid positions. In 2006, he was appointed by the employers&#x27; and employees&#x27; organizations of Germany&#x27;s construction sectorthe German Construction Confederation (ZDB), the Central Federation of the German Construction Industry (HDB), and IG Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt (IG BAU) to mediate in a dispute over salary increases. In 2018, he again helped the two sides to agree on a pay hike of roughly 6 percent for more than 800,000 construction workers.

In 2007, Clement was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the Universität Essen-Duisburg&#x27;s NRW School of Governance.

In 2017, Federal Minister of Health Hermann Gröhe appointed Clement as Special Commissioner for Germany&#x27;s candidacy to become the new headquarters of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). He was also an honorary member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

==Personal life==

Wolfgang Clement married his wife, Karin, in 1966 and went on to have five daughters and thirteen granddaughters. He died at his home in Bonn on 27 September 2020, at the age of 80. He had been suffering from lung cancer.

Clement&#x27;s work ethic was praised by colleagues across both sides of the aisle. Peer Steinbrück his successor as the President Minister of NRW, recollecting their time together in NRW, noted that he could work with a &quot;sensationally low need for sleep&quot; working at his desk until 11 PM before heading out to Rhöndorf in Düsseldorf&#x27;s old town for &quot;Altbiers,&quot; before returning to work at 7AM. Der Spiegel noted that &quot;Er könne zwölf Glas Bier schneller trinken als andere zwölf Korn.&quot; or that &quot;he could drink twelve glasses of beer faster than others could drink twelve shots&quot;. He had also won a beer drinking contest, by downing a glass of Kölsch beer in 1.5 seconds at a German beer association ceremony in Cologne being held at the 487th anniversary of the Beer purity law, or &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot;, in 2003. In his own words, the secret was &quot;Man muss nur das Zäpfchen zurückklappen!&quot; or that &quot;You just have to fold back the uvula!&quot;

<text>The Beechcraft Starship is a twin-turboprop six- to eight-passenger pressurized business aircraft produced by Beech Aircraft Corporation. Notable for its unusual canard design and extensive use of carbon fiber composite, it did not sell many units and production ceased in 1995, only nine years after the Starship&#x27;s first flight.

==Development==
Development of the Starship began in 1979 when Beech decided to explore designs for a successor to its King Air line of turboprops that would fly faster and carry more passengers. 
On August 25, 1982, Beech contracted with Scaled Composites to refine the design and build an 85% scale proof-of-concept (POC) aircraft. One of the significant changes made to the design by Scaled Composites was the addition of variable geometry to the canard.

The POC aircraft first flew in August 1983. This aircraft had no pressurization system, no certified avionics, and a different airframe design and material specifications from the planned production Model 2000. Only one POC was built and it has since been scrapped.

Prototypes were produced even as development work was continuing—a system demanded by the use of composite materials, as the tooling required is very expensive and has to be built for production use from the outset. Beech built three airworthy full-scale prototypes. NC-1 was used for aerodynamic testing and had an ejection seat. This was the only Starship equipped with conventional electro-mechanical avionics. NC-2 was used for avionics and systems testing and NC-3 was used for flight management system and powerplant testing. NC-1 first flew on February 15, 1986.

The program was delayed several times, at first due to underestimating the developmental complexity and manufacturing learning curve of the production composite construction, and later due to the technical difficulties of correcting a pitch damping problem and developing the stall-warning system. By the end of development, the Starship had grown larger in cabin volume than the King Air 350 while having the same gross ramp weight of . Starship development cost $300 million. The first production Starship flew on April 25, 1989.

== Design ==
The Starship is noteworthy for its unconventional carbon fiber composite airframe, canard design, lack of centrally located vertical tail, and pusher engine/propeller configuration. The aircraft employs a variable-sweep canard surface in order to counteract the nose-down pitch from extending the flaps.

Carbon fiber composite was used to varying degrees on military aircraft, but at the time the Starship was certified, no civilian aircraft certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had ever used it so extensively. Beech chose carbon fiber composite for its durability and high strength-to-weight ratio. According to Beech, the Starship weighs less than it would have if it were built from aluminum. Nonetheless, the empty weight of production aircraft exceeded the target by several thousand pounds.

Beech studied several configurations before settling on a canard configuration in early 1980. As configured, the Starship is difficult to stall; the forward surface stalls before the main lifting surface, which allows the nose to drop and more-normal flight to resume.

A traditionally located vertical tail would have transmitted propeller noise into the airframe. In its place, directional stability and control is provided by rudders mounted on the winglets. Because of this addition Beechcraft called the winglets &quot;tipsails&quot;.

Mounting the engines so that the propellers are facing rearward, pushing rather than pulling the aircraft, is done for the purpose of a quieter cabin, since the propellers are further back from the passengers and because vortices from the propeller tips do not strike the fuselage sides. However, the propellers are operating in a turbulent airflow in the pusher configuration (due to airflow past the wings moving aft in vortex sheets) and high-velocity exhaust gases are discharged directly into the propellers, producing more noise where they are than if the propellers had been in a tractor configuration.

Flight instrumentation for the Starship included a 14-tube Proline 4 AMS-850 &quot;glass cockpit&quot; supplied by Rockwell Collins, the first application of an all-glass cockpit in a business aircraft.

==Operational history==
Beech sold only eleven Starships in the three years following its certification. Beech attributed the slow sales to the economic slowdown in the late-1980s, the novelty of the Starship, and the tax on luxury items that was in effect in the United States at the time. However, 

In an effort to stimulate demand, Beech began offering two-year leases on new Starships in 1991. One of the Starships appeared in the opening scenes of the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; TV series episode &quot;Terminal Connection&quot; in 1991.

The last Starship, NC-53, was produced in 1995. In 2003 Beechcraft said that supporting such a small fleet of airplanes was cost-prohibitive and began scrapping and incinerating the aircraft under its control. The aircraft were sent to the Evergreen Air Center located at the Pinal Airpark in Arizona for destruction. Beech worked with owners of privately owned Starships to replace their airplanes with other Beech aircraft such as the Premier I jet.

In 2004, Raytheon, Beech&#x27;s parent company, sold off its entire inventory of Starship parts to a Starship owner for a fraction of its retail value.

==Variants==
;Model 115
:Conceptual 85% scale prototype, one built by Scaled Composites. Scrapped by Beech at Mojave Airport in 1990.

;Model 2000
:Initial production version. 20 produced including three pre-production airworthy prototypes.

;Model 2000A
:Beech did not serialise the 2000A as a distinct model and it was not issued a new FAA type certificate.

:The final 2000A configuration had tuning-fork-type noise dampers and improved insulation to reduce cabin noise and redesigned exhaust stacks for more efficient engine airflow. Stall strips placed on the front wing to enhance stall behavior were removed. Elimination of the stall strips reduced stall speed by up to , which allows the 2000A to takeoff from shorter runways. The 2000 had standpipes in the fuel tanks to artificially limit fuel capacity so the aircraft would meet a target payload weight. The standpipes were removed in the 2000A, increasing fuel capacity by . Both the maximum ramp weight and takeoff weight were increased by and zero fuel weight was increased .

:Beech produced a kit to upgrade serial numbers NC-4 through NC-20 to 2000A specifications.

==Aircraft on display==
Several Starships have been donated to museums since the decommissioning program began. The Kansas Aviation Museum received the first donated aircraft, NC-41, in August 2003 and the Beechcraft Heritage Museum in Tullahoma, TN, received the second donated aircraft, NC-49, in September 2003. NC-42 was donated to the Museum of Flight in Seattle, WA, and is currently on loan to the Future of Flight at Paine Field in Everett, WA. NC-27 was donated to Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon in late 2003 and is currently on static display. NC-23 is on Airline Row at the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum. NC-6 is on display in Liberal, KS, at the Mid-America Air Museum. Aircraft NC-28 is on display at the Queensland Air Museum, after it was used by the Queensland Institute for Aviation Engineering in Caloundra. Aircraft NC-14 is on display outside at the Southern Museum of Flight.

==Surviving aircraft==
In 2003 Evergreen Air Center sold 8 Starships back to private owners for $50,000 each. Most are being used for parts; however, one of these aircraft has since been made airworthy again. Some former Starship parts have been used on the Epic turboprop kitplane.

, nine Starships held an active registration with the FAA. Three Starships were registered in Oklahoma (NC-29, NC-35 &amp; NC-45), one in Texas (NC-50), one in Colorado (NC-51), and four were registered to Beechcraft in Wichita, Kansas (NC-2, NC-8, NC-19 &amp; NC-24). NC-51 was used as a chase plane during the re-entry phase of Burt Rutan&#x27;s SpaceShipOne. In October 2008 NC-29 was the first of the five remaining privately owned airworthy Starships to complete RVSM certification, returning the aircraft&#x27;s service ceiling to the original FL410 limit.

Salt Lake Community College used a Starship in their Aviation Maintenance program until late 2012 when it was sold and scrapped for parts.

As of September 2020, only six Starships are airworthy. Two Beechcraft Starships (NC-33 and NC-50) are located in Addison, Texas. NC-33 lost its data plate when it was scrapped, was subsequently registered in Mexico, but when brought back to the US, the FAA revoked its certificate. It is now registered in the experimental category as N903SC. The other airworthy Starships are located in Oklahoma (NC-35 and NC-45), Colorado (NC-51), and Germany (NC-29, though registered with the FAA by a company in Delaware).

<text> (French, from &#x27;to knead&#x27;) is a massage technique that applies deep pressure to the underlying muscles. Kneading, wringing, skin rolling, and pick-up-and-squeeze are the movements. They are all performed with the padded palmar surface of the hand, the surface of the finger and also the thumbs.

During kneading, the hands should be moulded to the area and the movements should be slow and rhythmical, with the tissue between the hands as the focus of the work.

Knuckling is another form of kneading but using the knuckles to knead and lift in circular and upwards motions.

Scissoring is another movement that is performed only over a flat area with very little pressure. The index and middle fingers of both hands are only used for this movement. They are placed opposite each other and then are slowly worked towards each other lifting and releasing as they go.

It is also a term used in French professional bread baking describing a particular stage during dough development.

<doc id="867821" wikidata="Q3424270" url="?curid=867821" title="Foreign relations of Tibet">
<text>The foreign relations of [[Tibet]] are documented from the 7th century onward, when Buddhism was introduced by missionaries from India and Nepal. The Tibetan Empire fought with the Tang dynasty for control over territory dozens of times, despite peace marriage twice. Tibet was conquered by the Mongol Empire and that changed its internal system of government, introducing the Dalai Lamas, as well as subjecting Tibet to political rule under the Yuan dynasty. Tibetan foreign relations during the Ming dynasty are opaque, with Tibet being either a tributary state or under full Chinese sovereignty. But by the 18th century, the Qing dynasty indisputably made Tibet a subject. In the early 20th century, after a successful invasion, Britain established a trading relationship with Tibet and was permitted limited diplomatic access to &quot;Outer Tibet&quot;, basically Shigatse and Lhasa. Britain supported Tibetan autonomy under the 13th Dalai Lama but did not contest Chinese suzerainty; while &quot;Inner Tibet&quot;, areas such as Amdo and Kham with mixed Chinese and Tibetan populations to the east and north, remained nominally under the control of the Republic of China although that control was seldom effective. Although the sovereignty of Tibet was unrecognized, Tibet was courted in unofficial visits from Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and the United States during and after World War II. The foreign relations of Tibet ended with the Seventeen Point Agreement that formalized Chinese sovereignty over most all of political Tibet in 1951.

==Early history==
Little is known of Tibet before the 7th century when Buddhism was introduced by missionaries from India; since the 7th century the Tibetan Empire emerged as a strong empire which lasted until the 9th century.

==Relations with the Tang dynasty==
The Tang dynasty (618–907) and the Tibetan Empire (618–842) were both powerful empires. Sino-Tibetan relations during the period between 618 and 842 were characterized by almost constant conflict and periodic attempts at peace-making.

It is recorded in Tibetan tradition that after Songtsen Gampo died in 650, the Chinese Tang dynasty attacked and captured Lhasa, however there is no record of it from Chinese sources.

There was a stone pillar, the Lhasa Zhol rdo-rings, in the ancient village of Zhol in front of the Potala in Lhasa, dating to c. 764 CE during the reign of Trisong Detsen. The inscription contains an account of the brief capture of Chang&#x27;an, the Chinese capital, in 763 CE during the reign of Emperor Daizong of Tang. As of 1993 the pillar was surrounded by buildings and wire so it could not be approached closely.

In 785, Wei Kao, a Chinese serving as an official in Shuh repulsed Tibetan invasions of the area.

A stone monument dating to 823 and setting out the terms of peace and borders between Tibet and China arrived at in 821 can still be seen in front of the Jokhang temple in Barkhor Square in Lhasa. The monument, a treaty of friendship, is written in both Tibetan and Chinese. The inscribed pillar was erected by the Chinese in 1793 during a smallpox epidemic. It records the Sino-Tibetan treaty of 822 concluded by King Ralpacan and includes the following inscription: &quot;Tibet and China shall abide by the frontiers of which they are now in occupation. All to the east is the country of Great China; and all to the west is, without question, the country of Great Tibet. Henceforth on neither side shall there be waging of war nor seizing of territory. If any person incurs suspicion he shall be arrested; his business shall be inquired into and he shall be escorted back.&quot; The inscription also carried advice on hygiene measures to prevent smallpox.

The relations between the two countries appears to have been complex. On the one hand, the monument describes connections between China and Tibet as similar to those between uncle and nephew. The Tang dynasty of China and the Yarlung dynasty of Tibet were indeed related by marriage, yet the terms uncle and nephew are not used in relation to other groups with whom the Chinese had connections by marriage. On the other hand, the monument seems to describe the two countries as equals. The text has been published several times.

==Relations with the Song dynasty==

The Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty, both of which were military powers, fell in 842 and 907 respectively. After that, Tibet entered an era of disunity known as the Era of Fragmentation. The Sino-Tibetan relations during the Song dynasty (960–1279) were ones of relative peace and cultural creativity.

==Mongol conquest and Tibet under the Yuan dynasty==

After the Mongol Prince Köden took control of the Kokonor region in 1239, in order to investigate the possibility of attacking Song China from the West, he sent his general Doorda Darqan on a reconnaissance mission into Tibet in 1240. During this expedition the Kadampa (Bka&#x27;-gdams) monasteries of Rwa-sgreng and Rgyal-lha-khang were burned, and 500 people killed. The death of Ögödei the Mongol Khan in 1241 brought Mongol military activity around the world ground, temporarily, to a halt. Mongol interests in Tibet resumed in 1244 when Prince Köden sent an invitation to Sakya Pandita (1182–1251) to come to his capital and formally surrender Tibet to the Mongols. Sakya Pandita arrived in Kokonor with his two nephews &#x27;Phags-pa (1235–80) and Phyag-na Rdo-rje (1239–67) in 1246.

After an internecine feud among the Mongol princes Kublai was appointed by
Möngke Khan to take charge over the Chinese campaigns in 1253. Since Sakya Pandita had already died Kublai took &#x27;Phags-pa into his camp as a symbol of Tibet&#x27;s surrender. Kublai was elected Khagan in 1260 following the death of his brother Möngke, although his ascendance was not uncontested. At that point he named &#x27;Phags-pa as &quot;State Preceptor&quot; (&quot;Guoshi&quot;). In 1265 &#x27;Phags-pa returned to Tibet and for the first time made an attempt to impose Sakya hegemony with the appointment of Sakya Bzang-po (a long time servant and ally of the Sakyas) as the &quot;dpon-chen&quot; (&#x27;great administrator&#x27;) over Tibet in 1267. A census was conducted in 1268 and Tibet was divided into 13 myriarchies.

In 1269 &#x27;Phags-pa returned to Kublai&#x27;s side at his new capital Khanbaliq (modern day Beijing). He presented Kublai Khan with a new script (the &#x27;Phags-pa script) designed to represent all of the languages of the empire. The next year he was named Imperial Preceptor (&quot;Dishi&quot;) of the Yuan dynasty, and his position as titular ruler of Tibet (now in the form of its 13 myriarchies) was reconfirmed, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative rule over the region. The Yuan-Sakya hegemony over Tibet continued into the middle of the 14th century, although it was challenged by a revolt of the &#x27;Bri-khung sect with the assistance of Hülegü of the Ilkhanate in 1285. The revolt was suppressed in 1290 when the Sakyas and eastern Mongols burned &#x27;Bri-khung and killed 10,000 people (cf. Wylie 1977).

==Relations with the Ming dynasty==
Modern historians still debate on the exact relationship the Chinese Ming dynasty (1368–1644) had with Tibet. Modern Chinese sources assert that the Ming dynasty had full sovereignty over Tibet, while scholars outside China generally assert that Tibet was simply an independent tributary and that the Ming merely had nominal suzerainty over Tibet by granting some lamas honorific titles.

==Tibet under the Qing dynasty==
The armies of the Qing dynasty first entered Tibet in response to a request for help when Tibet was invaded by the Dzungar Mongols in 1717. After the defeat of a first expeditionary force in the Battle of the Salween River in 1718 the Chinese expedition in 1720 was successful in restoring the Dalai Lama to power in Lhasa. Troops were withdrawn in 1723 leaving a civilian Chinese adviser in Lhasa. When civil war broke out in 1728 there were appeals from both sides for help from China and an army was once again dispatched to Lhasa. It was decided to appoint two &quot;ambans&quot;, civilian Chinese advisers to the Tibetan government, who would be guarded by a small military force. When there was unrest in 1750 an army was again dispatched and the ambans given more power. However, the ambans, isolated from imperial power centers, soon fell under the control of the local government. There was a long period of peace, and neglect by the Chinese of Tibetan affairs, but in 1792 an invasion by Gurkas of Nepal resulted in an appeal for aid and a successful Chinese response. In 1893 the Chinese imposed reforms in Tibet which resulted in closing of its borders to foreign travelers, but despite intentions to strengthen the role of the ambens, a long period of Chinese neglect followed which continued throughout the 19th century during which Tibet was &quot;closed&quot; but effectively on its own.

China did not make any attempt to impose direct rule on Tibet and the Tibetan government around the Dalai Lama or his regent continued to manage its day-to-day affairs, thus in their own view remaining independent. It was only after the invasion of imperial troops under the command of Zhao Erfeng in 1910 that an attempt at direct rule was made. The Tibetans were not cooperative and after the Republican Revolution of 1911 openly rebelled, surviving Chinese soldiers being evacuated through India. Declarations of independence made by the Dalai Lama were not recognized by Britain or China, but an effective military frontier was established which excluded troops and agents of the Chinese government until the invasion by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in 1950.

===British mission to the Panchen Lama===

After the Panchen Lama sent a letter to Warren Hastings first Governor-General of India with respect to a conflict of the British with Bhutan the British governor-general sent George Bogle in 1774 as emissary to the Panchen Lama. Traveling through Bhutan to the Panchen Lama&#x27;s seat at Tashilhunpo in 1775 Bogle established friendly relations with the 3rd Panchen Lama, Lobsang Palden Yeshe, so friendly that he took a close relative of the Panchen Lama as his wife. On Bogle&#x27;s death Captain Samuel Turner was appointed. However, following Hastings departure from India in 1785, there were no further direct relations with Tibet until late in the 19th century. Neither envoy was able to obtain permission to visit Lhasa or gain access to the Dalai Lama.

===Russia and The Great Game===
Between 1898 and 1901 Ngawang Dorjee traveled to St. Petersburg three times as an envoy of the Tibetan government. Gifts were exchanged and friendly relationships established, but no formal recognition resulted nor establishment of a Russian diplomatic presence in Lhasa. Ngawang Dorjee, the envoy, was one of the Buryats, a Lamaist people from the trans-Baikal region of Siberia, who had traveled to Tibet as a youth, studied at Drepung Monastery, been awarded the degree of Lharam Geshe, &quot;Master of Metaphysics, and appointed one of the seven Lharam Geshe teachers of the young 13th Dalai Lama. In 1907, a treaty between Britain and Russia recognized Chinese suzerainty over Tibet and agreed not to negotiate with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese government.Tibet Justice Center - Legal Materials on Tibet - Treaties and Conventions Relating to Tibet - Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907)[391]

===The 1904 British expedition of Tibet===

In 1904 A British diplomatic mission, accompanied by a large military escort, forced its way through to Lhasa.UK and China Relations The head of the diplomatic mission was Colonel Francis Younghusband. The principal motivation for the British mission was a fear, which proved to be unfounded, that Russia was extending its footprint into Tibet and possibly even giving military aid to the Tibetan government. When the mission reached Lhasa, the Dalai Lama had already fled to Urga in Mongolia, but a treaty known as the Treaty of Lhasa was signed by lay and ecclesasiastical officials of the Tibetan government, and by representatives of the three monasteries of Sera, Drepung, and Ganden. The treaty made provisions for the frontier between Sikkim and Tibet to be respected, for freer trade between British and Tibetan subjects, and for an indemnity to be paid from the Tibetan Government to the British Government for its expenses in dispatching armed troops to Lhasa. It also made provision for a British trade agent to reside at the trade mart at Gyantse. The provisions of this 1904 treaty were confirmed in a 1906 treaty signed between Britain and China, in which the British also agreed &quot;not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet.&quot; The position of British Trade Agent at Gyantse was occupied from 1904 up until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of &quot;Head of British Mission Lhasa&quot;, that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. (McKay, 1997, p. 230-1).

==Republican period==

In 1912, in the aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution, despite Chinese troops having withdrawn from Tibet, the Republic of China officially maintained that Tibet was an integral part of China but did not attempt to re-occupy it. In 1913, Tibet and the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia signed a treaty proclaiming their independence from China, and their mutual recognition. In 1914 a treaty was negotiated in India, the Simla Convention, representatives of China, Tibet and Britain participated. Again, Chinese suzerainty over Tibet was recognized and a boundary negotiated between British India and Tibet which was very generous to Britain. The treaty was never signed by the Chinese and thus never came into force. The Chinese raised a number of objections, especially their refusal to recognize any treaty between Tibet and Britain. The subsequent outbreak of the world wars and civil war in China caused distractions for the major powers and China, and the Tibetan government continued to exercise effective control over much of the historic lands of Tibet until 1950 despite endemic war with China on its eastern frontier during much of that period.

===Relations with Britain===

During most of the Republican period Tibet looked to Britain for diplomatic and military aid with respect to China. Military aid was given, but in only small quantities.

Following expulsion of the Chinese Tibet declared itself independent but was recognized by no nation other than Mongolia. Military clashes continued on the eastern frontier with China but a truce was called, while China, Tibet, and Britain attempted to negotiate a comprehensive settlement at Simla in India from 1913 to 1915. This was a failure with respect to China, which refused to assent to expansive Tibetan demands despite having no effective control, or even access, to most of the lands claimed by Tibet. However a successful agreement was made between Tibet and Britain which established mechanisms for trade. War continued on the eastern frontier with China until a truce was signed in October, 1918 which endured until 1930. Attempts at a settlement with China were fruitless due to Tibetan demands that China adhere to the Simla Accord and nationalist popular sentiment in China.

===Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai===
The Chinese Muslim Generals Ma Qi and his son Ma Bufang, who pledged allegiance to the Chinese government, initiated a bloody campaign against Tibetans in Qinghai province to subdue the region.

===Sino-Tibetan War===
In 1932, the Muslim Qinghai and Han-Chinese Sichuan armies of the National Revolutionary Army led by Chinese Muslim General Ma Bufang and Han General Liu Wenhui defeated the Tibetan army in the Sino-Tibetan War when the 13th Dalai Lama tried to seize territory in Qinghai and Xikang. Ma Bufang overran the Tibetan armies and recaptured several counties in Xikang province. Shiqu, Dengke, and other counties were seized from the Tibetans. The Tibetans were pushed back to the other side of the Jinsha river. Ma and Liu warned Tibetan officials not to dare cross the Jinsha river again. Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetans at Dan Chokorgon. Several Tibetan generals surrendered, and were demoted by the Dalai Lama. By August, the Tibetans lost so much land to Liu Wenhui and Ma Bufang&#x27;s forces that the Dalai Lama telegraphed the British government of India for assistance. British pressure led to Nanjing to declare a ceasefire. Separate truces were signed by Ma and Liu with the Tibetans in 1933, ending the fighting.

===German expedition to Tibet===

The 1938–1939 German expedition to Tibet was an expedition that arrived to Tibetan territory in 1939 and was led by Ernst Schäfer.

On September 29, this group had been observed by the British authorities in India. The expedition under the patronage of Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s Ahnenerbe Institute was guided by Ernst Schäfer, an SS officer.

===Japanese expedition to Tibet===

At about the same time, the 1939 Japanese expedition to Tibet of the Japanese ordered Kwantung Army agents to arrive in Tibet and Xinjiang to research the country and make contact with the inhabitants. Muslim warlord Ma Bufang was also an obstruction to Japanese agents trying to contact the Tibetans, he was called an &quot;adversary&quot; by a Japanese agent.

===Wartime relations with China===
Under orders from the Kuomintang government of Chiang Kai-shek, Ma Bufang repaired Yushu airport to prevent Tibetan separatists from seeking independence. Chiang also ordered Ma Bufang to put his Muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of Tibet in 1942. Ma Bufang complied, and moved several thousand troops to the border with Tibet. Chiang also threatened the Tibetans with bombing if they did not comply. Ma Bufang attacked the Tibetan Buddhist Tsang monastery in 1941. He also constantly attacked the Labrang monastery.

===Wartime relations with the United States===
The first United States mission to Tibet entrusted to Captain Ilya Tolstoy, a grandson of the novelist, a &quot;reconnaissance mission&quot; codenamed &quot;FE-2&quot; and approved by Franklin Delano Roosevelt on May 12, 1942, was sent by the OSS &quot;...to move across Tibet and make its way to Chungking, China, observing attitudes of the people of Tibet; to seek allies and discover enemies; locate strategic targets and survey the territory as a possible field for future activity.&quot; As an aristocrat Tolstoy was well equipped to deal with the British aristocrats of the Indian Raj and the Tibetan aristocrats of Lhasa. He was accompanied by Lieutenant Brooke Dolan II who had previously engaged in extensive naturalistic explorations in Tibet on behalf of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science. Leaving Washington in July, 1942, the party spent 3 months in India arranging permission to visit Lhasa. Permission was granted by the Tibetan government in September, 1942 to come to Lhasa and present gifts and a letter from President Roosevelt. On their way to Lhasa the expedition made contact in Yatung with a member of the Pandatsang family of Kham which controlled Tibet&#x27;s external wool trade, a major source of government revenue. Arriving in Lhasa in early December, they were granted an audience December 20, 1942 with the Dalai Lama, then only 7 years old. A letter from Franklin Roosevelt was delivered which was carefully phrased as being addressed to the Dalai Lama as a religious leader but not as the ruler of Tibet. Gifts were given to the Dalai Lama and gifts were received from the Tibetan cabinet, the Kashag. Tolstoy remained for three months but did not attempt to raise the question of transshipment of supplies to China as he could see the unfavorable attitude of the Tibetans. Tolstoy, joined by the head of the British mission in Tibet, Frank Ludlow, may have intimated to the Tibetans during this period that Tibet would be permitted to send a delegation to the postwar peace conference, an unauthorized representation both knew would not be supported by their respective governments. The Tibetans, on their quarter, were enthusiastic about the prospect. Permission was granted to Tolstoy and Dolan to continue on to China. The expedition, accompanied by a monk, a Tibetan official, and 5 Tibetan soldiers, left Lhasa in late February bound for China. Tolstoy arrived at Lanzhou in late June, 1943.

Little was accomplished as a result of the Tolstoy expedition other than establishing contact and the gathering of intelligence; although, a substantial report was prepared by Tolstoy and Donal on the geography, facilities, and people encountered on their journey as well as many photographs. Contacts made would prove useful later when the CIA offered aid to Tibetan rebels. Serious consideration was given to using a route over the Tibetan Plateau, but as the amount that could be transported by pack train was minuscule, and the agreement of both the Chinese and Tibetans would have to be obtained, the idea was abandoned in summer, 1944. However a small import quota was granted to Tibetan wool dealers by the United States and the promised three radio transmitters and six receivers were delivered to the Tibetan government in 1944; although great difficulty was encountered in setting them up and using them due to lack of trained technicians. While in Tibet, Tolstoy and the British resident had raised the possibility that Tibet might participate in post-war conferences. This never came to fruition as both Britain and the United States, in consideration of their relations with China, continued to take the position that Tibet was not a sovereign country.

The subject of Tibet arose briefly in international affairs in 1942-43 as a result efforts by the U.S. to fly aid to China over the Himalayas following the closure of the Burma Road. An America plane crashed in Tibet, and its five crew members were escorted back to India. The U.S. sent a mission to Lhasa led by Captain Ilya Tolstoy to study the possibility of an air supply route crossing Tibetan territory. Although the project was not pushed any further, it created a need to clarify Tibet&#x27;s status in international law. In 1942, US State Department formally notified the Chinese government based in wartime capital Chungking (Chongqing) that it had at no time raised any doubt about the Chinese sovereignty claim over Tibet. In 1995, US State Department reiterated its position during the hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:

:&quot;&quot;The United States considers the Tibet Autonomous Region or TAR (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Tibet&quot;) as part of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This longstanding policy is consistent with the view of the entire international community, including all China&#x27;s neighbors: no country recognizes Tibet as a sovereign state. Moreover, U.S. acceptance of China&#x27;s claim of sovereignty over Tibet predates the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1942, we told the Nationalist Chinese government then headquartered in Chongqing (Chungking) that we had &quot;at no time raised (a) question&quot; over Chinese claims to Tibet.&quot;&quot;

British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden accordingly wrote a note presented to the Chinese government which describes Tibet as, &quot;an autonomous State under the suzerainty of China&quot; that &quot;enjoyed de facto independence.&quot; Meanwhile, the British embassy in Washington told the U.S. State Department that, &quot;Tibet is a separate country in full enjoyment of local autonomy, entitled to exchange diplomatic representatives with other powers.&quot; Although London repeatedly asked the United States for assistance, the U.S. State Department refuted London&#x27;s claim:

:&quot;For its part, the Government of the United States has borne in mind the fact that the Chinese Government has long claimed suzerainty over Tibet and that the Chinese constitution lists Tibet among areas constituting the territory of the Republic of China. This Government has at no time raised a question regarding either of these claims.&quot;

===Postwar diplomatic efforts===
In October, 1945 the Tibetan cabinet and senior clerics prepared a diplomatic mission to India and China. Gifts were prepared and letters congratulating the successful belligerents were carefully drafted. The mission arrived in New Delhi in March, 1946 where gifts and letters were presented to the British viceroy and to the American diplomatic mission. After a delay, perhaps occasioned by British diplomatic reluctance, they proceeded to Nanking where a carefully crafted letter to Chiang Kai-shek was presented which asserted an expansive claim of independence. The Chinese were unresponsive and the delegation left Nanking in March, 1947 without formally acknowledging Chinese sovereignty as the Chinese requested. They were invited to an international conference of Asian countries in India in fall, 1946 and were seated, displayed their national flag and participated in the conference; this conference, however, was not a formal diplomatic event.

The letters to the United States, after long delay, were translated and dispatched to Washington along with a favorable note from U.S. charge dé affairs in New Delhi which stressed the potential strategic importance of Tibet. Washington was having none of that, however, and while encouraging scouting trips to Lhasa if the occasion should arise, deprecated efforts to establish a diplomatic relationship with Tibet.

===The trade delegation of 1947-1949===

In 1947 the Tibetan foreign office began planning a trade delegation to visit India, China, the United States and Britain. Initial overtures were made to the US embassy in India requesting meetings with President Truman and other US officials to discuss trade. This request was forwarded to Washington, but the State Department proved willing only to meet with the Tibetans on an informal basis. The delegation consisted of 4 persons, Tsepon Shakabpa, Tibet&#x27;s Chief of the Finance Department, Padatsang, and two others including a monk.

Armed with the first Tibetan passports, the delegation went first to New Delhi, meeting with Prime Minister Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi. Most foreign trade from Tibet passed through India, and it was the practice of the Indian government to convert any foreign currencies received into rupees before payment to Tibet. The Tibetans were unable to negotiate any change in this practice, which would have put hard currency into their hands. One of the goals of the trade delegation was to obtain gold or other solid backing for Tibetan currency.

It was the Chinese position that a Chinese passport was required for entry into China. These were issued, and the delegation entered China at Hong Kong, using them and spent 3 months in China. For the next leg of the journey to the United States and Britain, the Chinese took the position that they would only issue exit visas on the Chinese passports. However the Tibets managed to get a British consular officer in Nanking to issue a British visa on their Tibetan passports, and, again, a US officer in Hong Kong, thus defeating the efforts of the US State Department and the British Foreign Office to deny use of the Tibetan passports, a small victory.

The delegation arrived in San Francisco in July, 1948 where they were met by the British Consul. They traveled by train to Washington where, despite strong objections by the Chinese and reassurance that the United States recognized China&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; sovereignty over Tibet, the Tibetans were received by the Secretary of State, George Marshall. There was some language in the State Department&#x27;s negotiations with the Chinese which noted that they exerted no de facto control over Tibet and noted the traditional American principle of favoring self-determination, but no more definite statement was made regarding Tibetan sovereignty.

They requested aid from the United States in convincing India to free up their hard currency earning and also for permission to purchase gold from the United States for a currency reserve. They received no help on their problem with India but were given permission to purchase up to 50,000 ounces of gold.

Not meeting with President Truman, they proceeded to New York where they were greeted by their old friend, Ilya Tolstoy, who introduced them around. They met with Lowell Thomas, who was interested in visiting Tibet, and Dwight Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University, and other eastern establishment personalities as well as Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark who had an interest in Tibet.

In November the delegation set sail for Britain where they spent 3 weeks but were received coolly. Returning through India they were able to free up some foreign exchange for the purchase of gold and, adding money of their own, effected a purchase of $425,800 in gold which was transported to Tibet by pack animals.

Being received more warmly in the United States than in Britain, with whom they had a long established relationship, set the stage for later expansion of the relationship with the United States as they attempted to deal with later Chinese efforts to reassert effective control.

==People&#x27;s Republic of China==
Neither the Nationalist government of the Republic of China (and its successor in Taiwan) nor the People&#x27;s Republic of China have ever renounced China&#x27;s claim to sovereignty over Tibet. The PRC ascribes Tibetan efforts to establish independence as due to the machinations of &quot;British imperialism&quot; 系统维护_中华人民共和国外交部. According to the Chinese, the Tibetan cabinet, the Kashag, set up a &quot;bureau of foreign affairs&quot; in July, 1942 and demanded that the Chinese mission in Lhasa, the Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, deal only with it. The Chinese successfully withstood this.

In 1950 the People&#x27;s Liberation Army entered Tibet, meeting little resistance from the small and ill-equipped Tibetan army. In 1951 the 17 Point Agreement, signed under threat of a wholesale Chinese invasion by representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, provided for rule by a joint Chinese-Tibetan authority. This agreement was successfully put into effect in Tibet but in June 1956, rebellion broke out in the Tibetan populated borderlands of Amdo and Kham when the government tried to impose the socialist transformation policies in these regions that they had in other provinces of China. Since Amdo and Kham had not been under the control of Lhasa in 1950 but under the control of Chinese warlords, they were not considered by the Chinese to be part of Tibet and thus not subject to the &quot;go slow&quot; agreement. This unrest provided the opportunity for the CIA to support an armed Tibetan rebellion which eventually spread to Lhasa. The rebellion was crushed by 1959 and the Dalai Lama fled in disguise to India. Isolated actions continued until 1969. The Panchen Lama was set up as a figurehead in Lhasa while the Dalai Lama eventually created a Government of Tibet in Exile.

===Annexation of Tibet into the PRC===

The Battle of Chamdo in 1950 resulted in a flurry of diplomatic activity as Tibet attempted to negotiate with the Chinese government, appealed futilely to the international community, and then was forced to capitulate.

====The eve of the battle====
Prior to the Chinese attack on Tibetan army positions in Kham on October 5, 1950, the Tibetan government contacted the Chinese government privately through the Dalai Lama&#x27;s older brother&#x27;s father in law and received a reply from China agreeing to meet with the Tibetan delegation in Hong Kong.

<text>When the Red King Comes is the second album by the Elephant 6 band Elf Power. It is a concept album about the Red King&#x27;s kingdom. The cover art is taken from a section of an imaginary map called “The Land of Make Believe”, drawn in 1930 by Jaro Hess. A more complete version of the map can be seen in &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Map: An Atlas of Imaginary Lands&quot;.

&quot;Needles in the Camel&#x27;s Eyes&quot; is a cover of the Brian Eno song.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;though still noisy, the improved sound coincides with a sharper focus in the songwriting (that&#x27;s good) and the first hint of impending mythological obsessions (not so good).&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; thought that &quot;in Elf Power&#x27;s hands, psychedelia is a means of transforming personal trauma into a twisted kind of triumph.&quot;

AllMusic wrote that &quot;the fuzzy, lo-fi production is an Elephant 6 hallmark, but the unique instrumentation (electric horns, pump organs, even Nepalese percussion) and cryptic, stream-of-consciousness wordplay suggest something altogether different.&quot;

<text>The Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München (State Brewery in Munich, also &quot;Hofbräu München&quot;) is a brewery in Munich, Germany, owned by the Bavarian state government. The &quot;Hof&quot; (&quot;court&quot;) comes from the brewery&#x27;s history as a royal brewery in the Kingdom of Bavaria.
The brewery owns the &quot;Hofbräuhaus am Platzl&quot;, the &quot;Hofbräukeller&quot; and one of the largest tents at the Oktoberfest (&quot;Hofbräu-Festzelt&quot;).

There are many types of beer brewed using original recipes handed down by Wilhelm V, the Duke of Bavaria. The current beers produced include a Weißbier and Helles, Maibock, Dunkel and Oktoberfest lagers.

The Hofbräuhaus am Platzl in Munich inspired the song &quot;oans, zwoa, g&#x27;suffa&quot; (The Bavarian dialect for: &quot;one, two, down the hatch&quot;).

==History==

The Hofbräuhaus am Platzl was founded in 1589 by the Duke of Bavaria, Wilhelm V. It is one of Munich&#x27;s oldest beer halls. It was founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall stands today. The beer quickly became popular thanks to the first brewer, Heimeran Pongratz, and the &quot;Bavarian Beer Purity Law&quot; of 1516 that stated that only natural ingredients could be used in the brewing process.

Maximilian I, Wilhelm&#x27;s son and heir, did not care much for the Braunbier, which was the dark and heavy brown beer. So, in the beginning of the 17th century Maximilian I turned the brewery&#x27;s focus to wheat beers and forbade all other private breweries to brew wheat beer, thus creating a monopoly. In 1612, Heimeran Pongraz&#x27;s successor, Elias Pichler, was under pressure to brew a stronger beer, hence the Maibock. In fact, the Maibock beer became so famous that it once helped save the city from annihilation. When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1632, he threatened to sack the city of Munich. He agreed to leave the city in peace after the citizens paid a tribute of 300,000 Reichsthaler and 1000 buckets of beer, of which one third were Hofbräuhaus Maibock. In 1852, King Maximilian II transferred ownership of the brewery to the Kingdom of Bavaria.

Adolf Hitler announced the official program of the Nazi Party to a meeting of around 2,000 people at the Hofbräuhaus on 24 February 1920. At the time, he was propaganda chief of the party whilst the organisation was still relatively small. On 29 July 1921, he was elected Führer of the Nazi Party during a meeting at the Hofbräuhaus am Platzl.

==Franchises==

After World War II, thanks in part to legions of American soldiers stationed in Munich bringing home beer mugs with the &quot;HB&quot; logo, the Hofbräuhaus quickly became a major tourist attraction in Munich. Demand for Hofbräuhäuser in other parts of the world began almost immediately. The first Hofbräuhaus in Europe outside Germany was opened in Genoa, Italy, see Hofbräuhaus Genova. 

In 1968, Helmut Meyer opened the first Hofbräuhaus outside of Europe, in Market Lane, Melbourne, Australia, where it still operates today. The complex includes Alpine Bar and Bier Hall.

Since October 2005, there has been a Hofbräuhaus in Hamburg, Germany. In October 2008, a Hofbräuhaus in Bremen opened. There are also Hofbräuhäuser in other German cities including Berlin.

Hofbräuhaus franchises have opened in several places around the United States. Newport, Kentucky (Greater Cincinnati, Ohio) in April 2003, Las Vegas, Nevada, in January 2004, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in March 2009, Chicago, Illinois in January 2013, Cleveland, Ohio in October 2014 and Columbus, Ohio in November 2014. A franchise opened in Buffalo, New York in September 2020. A franchise had operated in St. Petersburg, Florida from September 2015 until March 2020. There is also a chain of Hofbräu Beer Gardens in Miami, Florida, Panama City Beach, Florida, New York, New York, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin which provide the traditional food and but do not brew their own Hofbräuhaus beer, only serve it.

The first Hofbräuhaus in Latin America was opened in Belo Horizonte, Brazil in November 2015.

The Marriott International in Dubai has licensed the brand and has opened a restaurant in their hotel. The Hofbräuhaus Seoul was the first Hofbräuhaus in Asia. There was also a franchise at the Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok.

<doc id="867825" wikidata="Q961588" url="?curid=867825" title="Ikara (missile)">
<text>The Ikara missile was an Australian ship-launched anti-submarine missile, named after an Australian Aboriginal word for &quot;throwing stick&quot;. It launched an acoustic torpedo to a range of , allowing fast-reaction attacks against submarines at ranges that would otherwise require the launching ship to close for attack, placing itself at risk. By flying to a distant target, the engagement time was dramatically shorter than provided by short-range weapons, giving the target less time to respond.

==Design and development==
With the development of nuclear power, submarine performance, especially speed, improved dramatically, as did the threat they posed. Simultaneously, sonar detection capability at long range was also improving significantly, but only short-range weapons were available to surface escort warships. The final British development of the A/S mortar was the Limbo mortar, able to fire in all directions but limited to a maximum range of . 

Known initially under the Rainbow Code name Blue Duck, the Ikara was a &quot;rocket-thrown weapon&quot; with similarities to the French Malafon. It differed from Malafon in that the torpedo was semi-recessed in the missile body rather than mounted in the nose. Ikara&#x27;s range at was double that of ASROC. Ikara was generally considered a superior system to ASROC as it was accurately guided during flight to ensure optimal targeting. A submarine would be aware from sonar contacts that it was about to be attacked and could engage in evasive changes of course. In ASROC&#x27;s flight time to maximum range of 55 seconds, a submarine travelling at could move from its position at launch, and a prediction would be made of the submarine&#x27;s likely position at torpedo splashdown. But during the design of Ikara around 1960 the range of the acoustic seeker of the Mk.44 torpedo was limited to , and consequently its kill probability was low. The range of the acoustic seeker was later improved.

Ikara was guided by radio command link until it reached the vicinity of the submarine, determined by the ship&#x27;s sonar contact, where it would first jettison the rear ventral fin and torpedo rear covering and then release its 12.7 inch Mark 44 or Mark 46 acoustically-guided anti-submarine torpedo. The torpedo payload would descend by parachute while the missile itself was programmed to splashdown some distance away to avoid interference with the acoustic torpedo&#x27;s seeker head. The torpedo would then begin a circular search pattern to find and lock onto a submarine contact.

Ikara was powered by a two-stage in-line solid-fuel &quot;Murawa&quot; rocket engine developed by Bristol Aerojet Ltd in the UK.

The Turana target drone was designed and built in Australia as a development of the Ikara anti-submarine weapon system. It was a target drone with remote control that was launched from the Ikara launcher for use in naval anti-aircraft target practice.

In 1982, work began on an improved version, the Super Ikara. This was to be turbojet-powered to give a maximum range of , and would be carried in, and launched from a container. While test launches were carried out in 1986, the project was abandoned due to a lack of interest from the UK.

==British variant differences==

A variant fitted to the British Royal Navy&#x27;s s differed in several respects from the original Australian version designed to operate in the Pacific. The Royal Navy required changes to the frequencies used in order to enable Ikara to be used in the NATO area, where different electronic warfare conditions and international frequency agreements had to be taken into account. Neither the Australian-built analogue computer system, nor the American Bunker Ramo Corporation 133 digital computer system, used in most RAN systems, were compatible with the ADA digital battle-control computers being fitted into Royal Navy ships, and this was also changed. The UK-manufactured version of the Mark 44 torpedo also differed from the US-built version purchased by the Australians for their Ikara missiles. The British also required the missile payload to be changeable aboard ship to permit different payload combinations to be used, including a nuclear depth bomb (NDB) option, and this, together with the different internal ship layouts required further changes to the missile, storage and handling arrangements. The Australian practice was to combine the missile and payload at a shore-based ordnance facility and issuing the complete unit to a ship; repair or maintenance was only possible ashore. In the British ships, the changes made enabled a faulty torpedo on a missile in working order to be replaced, increasing the flexibility of use of very limited stocks aboard; especially on lengthy deployments around the globe, as was more common with British ships than their Australian counterparts. The facility to change a torpedo payload aboard ship also permitted a change from a conventional torpedo to a WE.177A NDB, a facility for a nuclear option that was not needed on ships fitted with the Australian variant of Ikara. The British launcher also differed, covered by a zareba (breakwater) when not in use to prevent icing in northern waters, and extremely accurate in training in bearing. It was also notoriously noisy.

==Ikara-fitted ships==
Ikara was fitted to all of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) frigates/destroyer escorts and guided-missile destroyers. There were three main variants of the system fitted to RAN ships; F1, F2, and F3. The F1 system, using an analogue computer, a single launcher and without a data link, was fitted to HMA Ships and only. The F3 system, with a digital computer, digital display, single launcher and a digital data link, was fitted to the other four River class ships. HMAS Stuart and Derwent were fitted with F3/0 systems during Half-life refits during the 1980s. The F2 system, using a digital computer, digital display, two launchers and with a digital data link, was fitted to the three &quot;Perth&quot;-class destroyers. The digital computer used by the RAN was the AN/UYK-1 NTDS (Naval Tactical Data System) (Bunker Ramo 133). The Ikara missile was withdrawn from service by the RAN in 1991.

Ikara was also operated by the Brazilian Navy, Royal Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy. It was phased out in the early 1990s due to the obsolescence of the Mk 44 torpedo and inability to carry the newer and heavier Mk 46 or Stingray. The British purchased Ikara to fit to the two new CVA-01 aircraft carriers planned (and later cancelled) in the 1960s, and their escorts, the Type 82 destroyers, of which only one, was built. With the cancellation of the remaining escorts, the British were left with purchased Ikara missiles in storage, and opted to fit them into eight existing Batch 1 &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates in need of modernisation: HM ships , , , , , , and .

<doc id="867837" wikidata="Q1739959" url="?curid=867837" title="Chain pump">
<text>The chain pump is type of a water pump in which several circular discs are positioned on an endless chain. One part of the chain dips into the water, and the chain runs through a tube, slightly bigger than the diameter of the discs. As the chain is drawn up the tube, water becomes trapped between the discs and is lifted to and discharged at the top. Chain pumps were used for centuries in the ancient Middle East, Europe, and China.

==In the Near East and Europe==
The earliest evidence for this device is in a Babylonian text from about 700 B.C. They were commonly powered by humans or animals. The device then appeared in ancient Egypt from about 200 B.C., featuring a pair of gear-wheels.

A version of the chain pump was used in ancient Greece and Rome, sometimes with pots, or scoops fixed to the chain, which, as they passed over the top pulley, tipped the water out; a 2nd-century example is preserved in London. Philo of Byzantium wrote of such a device in the 2nd century B.C.; the historian Vitruvius mentioned them around 30 B.C. Fragments of the cogs, crank, and discs, of a bilge pump, from a 1st-century Roman barge, were unearthed at Lake Nemi.

Chain pumps were used in European mines during the Renaissance; mineralogist Georg Agricola illustrated them in his &quot;De re metallica&quot; (1556). Chain pumps were commonly used on naval vessels of the time to pump the bilges, and examples are known in the nineteenth century for low-lift irrigation.

==China==
Chain pumps were also used in ancient China from at least the 1st century A.D. In China, they were also called &quot;dragon backbones&quot;. One of the earliest accounts was a description by the Han dynasty philosopher Wang Chong (A.D. 27–97) around A.D. 80. Unlike those found in the West, chain pumps in China resembled the square-pallet type instead of the pear-shaped bucket. Illustrations of such Chinese chain pumps show them drawing water up a slanted channel. These were sometimes powered by hydraulics of a rushing current against a horizontal water wheel acting against a vertical wheel, and others by a horizontal mechanical wheel acting upon a vertical wheel that was pulled by the labor of oxen. There were also square-pallet chain pumps operated by pedals.

From the 1st century onwards, chain pumps were widespread throughout the Chinese countryside. Chinese square-pallet chain pumps were used mostly for irrigation, though they found use in public works as well. The infamous Eastern Han court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. A.D. 189) once ordered the engineer Bi Lan (畢嵐) to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside the capital city Luoyang. These chain pumps serviced the palaces and living quarters of the Luoyang; the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a pipe system. Ma Jun, the renowned mechanical engineer of the Three Kingdoms era, also constructed a series of chain pumps for watering the palatial gardens of Emperor Ming of Wei (226–239).

During the period of agricultural expansion in Song China (10th–13th centuries CE), the technology of water-rising devices was improved. For some centuries they had been used for moving water for drainage or irrigation purposes. The simplest design, known as the counterbalanced bucket or &#x27;swape&#x27; or &#x27;well-sweep&#x27; was in common use at that time. A more complicated design, the &#x27;square-pallet chain pump&#x27;, was introduced several centuries before the growth in Song technology, but had not seen prior use for farming. They became more common around the end of the first millennium AD.

From the 13th century onwards, the Chinese also used windmills (acquired from the Middle East) to power square-pallet chain pumps. Yet there were other types of chain pumps besides the square-pallet design. In Song Yingxing&#x27;s (1587–1666) encyclopedic book the &quot;Tiangong Kaiwu&quot; (1637), there is description and illustration of a cylinder chain pump, powered by waterwheels and leading water up from the river to an elevated plain of agricultural crops.

The contribution of chain pumps to agricultural growth during the Song was extolled by poets such as Li Chuquan (李处权) of the twelfth century. The Song government actively spread the technology, introducing pumping equipment and chain pumps to those areas as yet unfamiliar with the technique.

<text>Nox is an action role-playing game developed and published by Westwood Studios and Electronic Arts in 2000 for Microsoft Windows. It details the story of Jack, a young man from Earth who is pulled into a high fantasy parallel universe and has to defeat the evil sorceress Hecubah and her army of necromancers to return home. Depending on the player&#x27;s choice of character class at the beginning of the game (warrior, conjurer, or wizard), the game follows three largely different linear storylines, each leading to its unique ending.

In multiplayer, players can compete against each other in various game modes such as deathmatch and capture the flag, while the freely downloadable expansion pack &quot;NoxQuest&quot; added a cooperative multiplayer mode. The game was generally well received by critics and the media.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Jack from oblique perspective with the mouse and a number of pre-defined hotkeys. The line of sight is limited by an innovative and well-received fog of war system named &quot;TrueSight&quot;, which dynamically blacks out portions of the screen which Jack cannot see from his current position. The single-player campaign consists of multiple locations which Jack must explore, killing enemies and monsters and assisting his allies. In each campaign the player receives a piece of a powerful magical staff and must gain the other two pieces, which are guarded by factions representing the classes not chosen by the player, ultimately using the assembled weapon to defeat Hecubah.
Most of the game time is spent in dungeons and wilderness where Jack gathers experience points and collects items such as weapons, armor and spells, which can be equipped, learned, or sold to traders found in several locations throughout the game. The story is told through dialogue with non-player characters, cut scenes using the game engine, and a few pre-rendered full motion videos.

Depending on the character class the player selects at the beginning of the game, the style of gameplay varies greatly. The warrior characters are able to equip nearly all armour and mêlée weapons available in the game but cannot use bows, magical staves, or magical spells. They do have five spell-like special abilities but instead of using up magic points like the other classes&#x27; spells, they recharge over time. The conjurer class specializes in conjuration of various monsters found throughout the game, healing himself and his allies, and the use of bows and crossbows. They have a smaller array of spells than wizards but can summon monsters they&#x27;ve learned about from items called &quot;Beast Scrolls&quot;. Alternatively, they can tame wild animals and monsters into following and fighting for them. The wizard characters are very limited in equippable weapons and armor and have very few hit points but can learn the largest array of magical spells, which they can use not only to kill enemies, but also to teleport themselves, to become invisible, and to heal themselves and their allies. Owing to its origins as a multiplayer magical combat simulator, the magic system is complex and allows for spell combinations and traps, inspired by &quot;&quot;.

Weapons in the game come in many varieties and largely restricted to certain classes: most melee weapons and a few ranged weapons can only be used by warriors; bows and crossbows, by conjurers; and many magical staves, by wizards. Some weapons have enchantments on them that add magical bonus to the physical damage they deal to enemies. Armor can also have enchantments on it, protecting the wearer from certain types of harm (fire, poison, etc.). With very few exceptions, both weapons and armor wear down when used, so the player must either have them repaired by NPC traders or replace them with new items. At several points of the single-player campaign, non-player characters temporarily follow Jack, either to assist him or to be led to safety by him. These NPCs can be neither controlled by the player nor equipped with better items.

The multiplayer game types are similar to those found in online first-person shooters: deathmatch (further subdivided into &quot;free for all&quot;, team, and clan modes), capture the flag, &quot;Flagball&quot; (similar to the &quot;Bombing Run&quot; mode in &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;), &quot;King of the Realm&quot;, and &quot;Elimination&quot; (deathmatch with limited respawns). The expansion pack &quot;NoxQuest&quot; introduced an eponymous cooperative multiplayer mode, wherein a player team must navigate through various locations, killing monsters and looting items. Originally, Westwood ran an online ladder ranking system of &quot;Nox&quot; multiplayer matches and team-based &quot;Clan Matches&quot; but it has since been closed down. The online services of the game were officially replaced by redirecting to the server portal XWIS maintaining the game&#x27;s online playability; a feature shared by other Westwood Studios &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; titles.

==Plot==
===Synopsis===
The back-story of &quot;Nox&quot; is explained through location loading screens. Some decades before Jack&#x27;s arrival to the Land of Nox (the eponymous fictional setting of the game), a group of Necromancers attempted to seize control over the world but was stopped by the legendary hero Jandor wielding an artifact weapon named &quot;the Staff of Oblivion&quot;. Following the Necromancers&#x27; defeat, Jandor trapped their souls within the magical Orb, which the Arch-Wizard Horvath then transported to another dimension later revealed to be modern Earth. One of Jandor&#x27;s last deeds of the war was saving a female infant he found in the Necromancers&#x27; lair: unsure what to do with a possible Necromancer offspring, he left the girl in the care of an Ogre village. He then disassembled the Staff and gave each piece to one of the three powerful factions in the game: the Fire Knights of the fortress Dün Mir (the Halberd of Horrendous), the wizards of Castle Galava (the Heart of Nox), and the conjurers&#x27; Temple of Ix (the Weirdling Beast). After this, he assumed the nickname &quot;Airship Captain&quot;, under which he plays a mentor role to the player throughout the game.

The game opens with a pre-rendered video of a grown-up Hecubah, the Necromancer girl, who has rediscovered her roots and proclaimed herself the Queen of Necromancers, summoning the Orb back from Earth to greatly increase her power. However, her magic also transports the current owner of the artifact, Jack (who believes it to be a fireplace mantel decoration), to the Land of Nox. Jack lands on Jandor&#x27;s airship and at this point, the storylines branch, depending on the player&#x27;s selection of character class. The warriors start the game near the subterranean fortress of Dün Mir; conjurers, near the Village of Ix; and wizards, near Castle Galava. Upon completing any one of the storylines, the Airship Captain&#x27;s voice during the rolling credits prompts the player to complete the game using another class.

* Upon reaching Dün Mir, the warrior characters must go through the Gauntlet, a labyrinth full of monsters, to prove their skills to the Warlord Horrendous and to gain the rank of a &quot;Fire Knight&quot;. Horrendous then sends the player to the Village of Ix to help the conjurers get rid of hedgehog-like monsters harassing the settlement. On the way back, Jack runs into some undead and to investigate them, the Airship Captain transports him to the Field of Valor, the battlefield-turned-graveyard of the Necromancer war. In the crypts beneath the Field, the player first encounters Hecubah and has to fight one of her Necromancer henchmen and many undead. Jack exits the crypts to find the nearby city of Brin devastated by an Ogre invasion and is entrusted with rescuing a group of women taken to the Ogre village of Grok Torr. Afterwards, Jandor arrives and tells Jack to reassemble the Staff of Oblivion and to defeat Hecubah with it. The first part to retrieve is the Halberd of Horrendous so Jack returns to Dün Mir, now besieged by undead, and witnesses Hecubah killing the Warlord. He is able to retrieve the Halberd and travels to Castle Galava to collect the second part of the Staff, the Heart of Nox, guarded by hostile wizards. The third part is the Weirdling, a living creature kept in the Temple of Ix and guarded by powerful monsters. The final part is the Orb itself, so Jack has to find his way to the Necromancers&#x27; Land of the Dead through the Dismal Swamp. Upon reassembling the Staff, he follows Hecubah to the Underworld and defeats her in the climactic final battle. After her death, Jack is immediately transferred back to Earth through a magical portal.
* The conjurers start the game in the vicinity of the Village of Ix. Jack&#x27;s first tasks are to locate his future mentor Aldwyn and to clear out the same monster lair as in the warrior&#x27;s storyline. The third task is to rescue the Mana Mine workers near Ix who were befallen by monsters and scattered. Suspecting Hecubah behind the Mana Mine incident, the Airship Captain sends Jack to the Field of Valor. This part of the game is identical to the warrior&#x27;s route, except that the conjurer must retrieve the Arch-Wizard Horvath&#x27;s Amulet of Teleportation from Grok Torr instead of rescuing Brin women. Upon retrieving the Halberd of late Horrendous, Jack travels to Galava to find it overrun by the Ogres. Unlike the warrior, the conjurer is assisted by the wizards, and Horvath sacrifices himself to let Jack escape Hecubah. Retrieving the Weirdling and the rest of the game is identical to the warrior&#x27;s storyline but the finale is different: using his abilities to possess Hecubah&#x27;s Ogre bodyguards, Jack entraps her soul within the Orb, and the ending video sees Jandor pondering how to transport him back home.
* The wizards route begins near Castle Galava, where Jack is tutored by Arch-Wizard Horvath. The first task is to locate Horvath&#x27;s missing apprentice whose death prompts the Arch-Wizard to replace him with Jack. Now a wizard apprentice, the protagonist performs multiple duties around Galava, one of which sees him fighting a Necromancer. Like in the other two storylines, the Airship Captain transports Jack to the Field of Valor after this, and the plot remains the same except that Horvath himself must be rescued from the Ogre village. Unlike the warrior and the conjurer, however, the wizard has to take the Halberd from Horrendous by killing him. Jack returns to Castle Galava where Horvath hands him the Heart of Nox before being killed by Hecubah, who also teleports Jack to the Underworld. After escaping it, Jack retrieves the Weirdling and travels to the Land of the Dead like in the other routes. However, the wizard characters receive a twist ending wherein upon being defeated, Hecubah turns into an apparently innocent and amnesiac version of herself. Jack&#x27;s final words in the game suggest that he stays in the Land of Nox with the redeemed Hecubah.

===Characters===
* Jack Mower is the protagonist of the game. At the beginning of the story, he lives in a trailer with his girlfriend Tina on Earth and is the owner of the Orb. After Hecubah&#x27;s magic transports him to the Land of Nox along with the Orb and his TV set, he is tutored by Jandor and either Horrendous, Aldwyn, or Horvath to become the new hero of Nox. In the warrior route, Jack returns to Earth; in the conjurer route, his return home is left uncertain; and in the wizard route, he stays in Nox. He is voiced by Seann William Scott.
* Hecubah is the self-proclaimed Queen of Necromancers and the chief antagonist of the game. Her origins are unknown, as Jandor found her in the Land of the Dead after the Necromancer war and left her in care of an Ogre village. Her magic summons both the Orb and Jack to the Land of Nox, eventually leading to her demise. Jack kills her in both the warrior and the conjurer routes but as a wizard, he is able to purify her soul, turning her into an innocent and amnesiac version of herself. She is voiced by Joanna Cassidy.
* Jandor, also known as the &quot;Airship Captain&quot;, is the legendary hero of the Necromancer war who defeated the Necromancer army with the Staff of Oblivion. After that, he assumed the identity of an eccentric old airship captain, who plays mentor role to Jack throughout the game. His real identity is revealed half-way through the game, when he instructs Jack to reassemble the Staff. He is voiced by Alan Oppenheimer.
* Warlord Horrendous is the leader of the Fire Knights of the fortress Dün Mir and the guardian of the first piece of the Staff of Oblivion, the Halberd named after him. In the warrior route, he tutors Jack for a short time before sending him to the Village of Ix. In all storylines, Horrendous is killed before Jack acquires the Halberd, either by Hecubah or by Jack himself (as a wizard). He is voiced by Mark Rolston.
* Aldwyn the Conjurer is the most powerful conjurer in the Land of Nox, who briefly tutors Jack in the conjurer route. He is loosely affiliated with the Temple of Ix, where the Weirdling is kept, and lives far to the east of the Village of Ix. He is brother of Mordwyn the Druggist. Aldwyn is voiced by Warren Burton.
* Arch-Wizard Horvath is the head of the wizards of Castle Galava, where the Heart of Nox, the second part of the Staff of Oblivion, is kept. He doesn&#x27;t appear in the warrior route but is a prominent figure in the wizard&#x27;s one, wherein he first accepts Jack as his apprentice, is then saved by him from the Ogre village, and finally sacrifices himself to let Jack escape Hecubah. He is voiced by Ian Abercrombie.
* Morgan Lightfingers is a notorious thief and con artist whom all classes meet under different circumstances: the Wizard must capture him early in the game, while the Warrior must cooperate with him to escape from Castle Galava prison; to the Conjurer, Morgan simply sells a cheap bow. He is voiced by Warren Burton.
* Mordwyn the Druggist is Aldwyn&#x27;s brother who lives in the Dismal Swamp and appears late in every game route to briefly assist Jack on his quest. He is voiced by Bill Woodsen, who also provides the narrator voice in the game.
* Gearhart is the chief engineer of Dün Mir whose commendation is necessary for Jack to apply for a Fire Knight rank. He is voiced by Mike Booth, who was also the author of the original concept of the game and its lead programmer.
* Mayor Theogrin is the cowardly chief of the Village of Ix. He plays a minor role in warrior and conjurer routes. He is voiced by Lee Perry.
* Tina is Jack&#x27;s girlfriend on Earth who appears in the intro and the warrior ending video. She is voiced by Susan Chesler.

==Development==
===Production===
The development of the game started in 1995 as a personal project of Mike Booth, the future technical director and lead gameplay designer of the game. An avid gamer, Booth began programming his own games on Apple II and VIC-20 computers while still at school, and started working on &quot;Nox&quot; &quot;in a spare bedroom of [his] house&quot; in college. To help produce the game, he co-founded Hyperion Technologies, a company that also worked on driving simulators. After Booth showed a demo of &quot;Nox&quot; to John Hight, an executive producer of Westwood Studios, at the 1997 Game Developers Conference, Westwood decided to acquire it and moved the development team to California.

Booth originally envisioned the game as an &quot;updated version of Atari&#x27;s &quot;Gauntlet&quot;&quot;, focusing on real-time magical combat in the vein of &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. Inspired by the &quot;epic wizard battles&quot; described in fantasy literature, Booth wanted to create a &quot;multiplayer wizard battle game&quot; and decided to set it in a medieval fantasy setting. It wasn&#x27;t until Westwood started working on the game that it began to lean towards the RPG genre and two more classes (warrior and conjurer) and a single-player campaign were added.

The game was originally intended to be played with a gamepad, with spells cast by quickly pressing several buttons, inspired by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;&#x27;s combos, but it was eventually deemed to be &quot;a large barrier for new and less dexterous players&quot; and replaced with numeric hotkeys and mouse-controlled movement. The leftovers of this system are, however, still seen in the released game in the form of syllables and hand gesture icons accompanying the casting of each spell. The &quot;TrueSight&quot; vision system has been programmed by Booth early in the development and served as one of the cornerstones of the gameplay.

The game is incredibly quick paced, requiring lightning reflexes and hand movements. Wizards have to be especially quick with hands, since toggling through 5x5 spell slots in the middle of a battle is a necessity, using obelisks and another obstacles in order to shield yourself from opponents. Warriors have to use precision and run around a lot, in order to predict the movement paths and strike in the correct moment. Conjurers are the most fragile class, but with the most deadly spells and weapons, finding angles and using monsters as their shield.

The multiplayer modes were inspired by the online first-person shooters, such as &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Unreal&quot;, both of which the development team played extensively.

===Marketing===
The game was &quot;one of the most-hyped games&quot; at E3 1999 and well received by journalists. In particular, they praised the TrueSight vision system, the &quot;elegant&quot; interface, and the dynamic game world.

In October 1999, Westwood began &quot;Meet Nox Tour&quot; in San Francisco Bay Area as part of a marketing campaign to raise awareness of the game and receive beta-testing feedback. The event was a LAN party lasted about five hours and capped off with a series of multiplayer tournaments; with a final prize of US$200 CompUSA stored-value card. The entire tour ended shortly before the release of the game and was, according to the executive producer John Hight, &quot;a tremendous success&quot;. To promote Nox in post-launch, another event was organized in June 2000 in Las Vegas by Westwood; the LAN party was a mass tournament, ended with a final head-to-head clash between two highest-score gamers to win a new computer system worth US$2,500.

&quot;Nox&quot; has been re-distributed via digital delivery on Origin, and CD Projekt&#x27;s GOG.com.

==Reception==
The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. It was often compared to &quot;Diablo II&quot;, which was released five months after it. Trent C. Ward of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game as a successful clone of &quot;Diablo&quot; and highly recommended the former, citing its graphics and gameplay quality, but criticizing some of its sound effects. P. Stefan &quot;Desslock&quot; Janicki of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that some of the gameplay elements are completely new, and appreciated both single-player and multiplayer component of the game, describing it as challenging and entertaining. On the contrary, Johnny B. of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; declared that the game has &quot;nothing very original&quot;, although it has appreciable graphics, variety and gameplay. The game was reviewed in 2000 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #271 by Johnny L. Wilson in the &quot;Silicon Sorcery&quot; column. Wilson commented that &quot;the game has beautiful art, impressive technology, near-limitless action, and a marvelous style in its use of traps&quot;. Michael Lafferty of &quot;GameZone&quot; gave it nine out of ten, saying, &quot;With the great graphics, interactive game board and challenge, this is bound to be one of the most successful titles Westwood has ever produced.&quot; However, Eric Bratcher of &quot;NextGen&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Nox&quot; will have a difficult time avoiding the dismissal, ″&quot;Diablo&quot; wannabe&#x27; (especially with &quot;Diablo II&quot; looming on the horizon), but those who try it will find a solid game that can stand on its own merits.&quot;

During the AIAS&#x27; 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Nox&quot; was a finalist for the &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot; awards, both of which were ultimately given to &quot;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&quot;, &quot;&quot; (both of them in a tie), and &quot;The Sims&quot;, respectively.
==Cancelled sequel==
Executive producer John Hight said that Westwood was considering an expansion pack and a sequel to &quot;Nox&quot;. The expansion, titled &quot;NoxQuest&quot;, was released as a free download on August 1, 2000, and focused on the multiplayer aspects of the game. It included the last patch, updating the game to version 1.2, and featured a number of new spells invented for but not implemented in the original game.

Shortly after the 1.2 patch release, Westwood Studios (which is a subset of Electronic Arts) lost full rights of &quot;Nox&quot; to EA. EA chose to no longer support &quot;Nox&quot;, and the official Westwood servers for Clan, Ladder and Standard multiplayer were closed, as well as the online ladder ranking system.

<text>The Dean of Canterbury is the head of the Chapter of the Cathedral of Christ Church, Canterbury, England. The current office of Dean originated after the English Reformation, although Deans had also existed before this time; its immediate precursor office was the prior of the cathedral-monastery. 

The current Dean, David Monteith was installed on 17 December 2022, and is the 40th Dean since the Reformation, though the position of Dean and Prior as the religious head of the community is almost identical so the line is unbroken back to the time of the foundation of the community by Saint Augustine in AD 597. The previous Dean, the Very Rev. Robert Willis, was appointed in 2001 and retired on 16 May 2022, a day before his 75th birthday.

<doc id="867848" wikidata="Q5323079" url="?curid=867848" title="EGroups">
<text>eGroups.com was an email list management website. The site allowed users to create their own mailing lists and sign up for membership. The website provided archives of the messages as well as list management functionality. Each group also had a shared calendar, file space, group chat, and a simple way to communicate. eGroups was bought in August 2000 by Yahoo! and became a part of Yahoo! Groups, which as of the end of 2019 were under Verizon ownership.

==History==
The service was started by Scott Hassan in 1997 as an email list archiving service called FindMail (mimicking the name &quot;FindLaw&quot;, a company co-founded by Martin Roscheisen). Carl Victor Page Jr., Larry Page&#x27;s brother, joined the company in May 1997. When Martin Roscheisen joined as CEO in March 1998, FindMail was incorporated (in June 1998) and shifted its focus towards hosting email groups. FindMail, then renamed &quot;eGroups&quot;, grew to 250,000 users before taking a venture finance round of $810,000 from Atlas Venture in May 1998. In October 1998, with 1.2 million users (growing at 12,000 users per day), Excite offered to acquire the company for $40 million, but the company decided instead to take $5.1 million more investment money from Sequoia Capital.
In September 1999, eGroups started work on an initial public offering but instead merged with ONElist, with 13 million users exchanging more than 1.3 billion email messages each month. In January 2000, the company raised $42 million and filed a S-1 with the SEC on March 23, 2000.

In August 2000, with 18 million users, the company was bought by Yahoo! for $432 million in a stock deal and became Yahoo! Groups.

In 2019, Verizon bought Yahoo! and shut down the ability to upload new files on October 29, 2019, and removed the existence of files in the Groups on January 31, 2020, with mailing lists remaining available.

On October 12, 2020, Yahoo announced it would permanently shut down Yahoo!Groups effective December 15, 2020. After that date, all groups would be deleted and the service would no longer be available.

<doc id="867850" wikidata="Q156999" url="?curid=867850" title="Lucien Febvre">
<text>Lucien Paul Victor Febvre ( ; ; 22 July 1878 – 11 September 1956) was a French historian best known for the role he played in establishing the Annales School of history. He was the initial editor of the &quot;Encyclopédie française&quot; together with Anatole de Monzie.

==Biography==
Lucien Febvre was born and brought up in Nancy, in northeastern France. His father was a philologist, who introduced Febvre to the study of ancient texts and languages, which significantly influenced Febvre&#x27;s way of thinking. At the age of twenty, Febvre went to Paris to enroll in the École Normale Supérieure. Between 1899 and 1902, he concentrated on studying history and geography. After his graduation from college, Febvre taught at a provincial &quot;lycée&quot;, where he worked on his thesis on Philip II of Spain and the Franche-Comté. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Febvre was forced to leave his teaching post to join the army, where he served for four years. Febvre took up a position at the University of Strasbourg in 1919 when the province was returned to France. While there, Febvre became acquainted with Marc Bloch, who shared Febvre&#x27;s philosophical and political approach, which brought the two men together.

The time Febvre spent in Paris played an enormous role in reshaping his outlook on the world. Prevalent approaches to art, philosophy and modern ways of thinking strongly influenced Febvre. He embraced 20th century modernism to the extent that he later claimed to have become &quot;untuned&quot; from the old world and the old ways of thinking.

In his approach to history, Febvre contextualized events against the geography, psychology and culture of the times about which he wrote. History as a mere collection of historical facts no longer held any interest for Febvre.

==Early work==
Febvre&#x27;s first thesis on Philip the Second and the Franche-Comté, published in 1911, showed the strength of this approach. In this work, Febvre tried to demonstrate the context that shows events in their true light. Febvre reconstructed the life of villagers and town dwellers in a small traditional province in France by contextualizing historical events in terms of the geography and environment of the times. By describing Franche-Comté&#x27;s rivers, salt mines, vineyards and other surroundings, Febvre created an accurate and true-to-life portrayal of the atmosphere and outlook of the time. With this approach, Febvre was also able to reveal a negative influence that the French Government of the time played in the life of this province. This approach to history is known as &quot;histoire totale&quot;, or &quot;histoire tout court.&quot; Later, Febvre&#x27;s work would be a paradigm for the &quot;Annales School&quot; and would become a new way of historical thinking.

Another influential work of Febvre dealt with Protestantism. Published in the &quot;Revue Historique&quot; in 1929, &quot;Une question mal posée&quot; attempted to study popular religion by trying to observe and quantify human behavior. Through an enormous amount of research, Febvre collected information from various monasteries and chapels to study the influence of new wave philosophy in religion and the clergy&#x27;s approach to understanding and translating their views to lay people. Through this work, Febvre became very involved in the field of ethnology, a field of study that quantifies human behavior. Some critics consider this work to be heavily influenced by Febvre&#x27;s own views of the surrounding world.

As time went by, Febvre grew increasingly suspicious of theology. He refused to see people as bound by forces beyond their control. He came to the view that religion and old ways of thinking were impractical, maybe even dangerous, in modern times. &quot;In the general confusion of our time,&quot; Febvre wrote, &quot;old ideas refuse to die and still find acceptance with the mass of the population.&quot; He became convinced that changing religious views and attitudes is as difficult as trying to influence the outcome of any sort of political or social upheavals. He believed that people needed to be educated in order to avoid the dangers of the old ways of thinking.

==Annales==
In 1929, Lucien Febvre, along with his colleague and close friend Marc Bloch, established a scholarly journal, &quot;Annales d&#x27;histoire économique et sociale&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Annales&quot;), from which the name of their distinctive style of history was taken. The journal followed Febvre&#x27;s approach to describing history. Its approach was to educate the world about the dangers of old-world thinking to avoid possible future economic and political disasters. Its purpose was to influence academic circles to &quot;study ... the present so as to reach a profounder understanding of the past.&quot; This journal was like no other scholarly publication at that time.

The &quot;Annales&quot; was met with a very favorable critical reception and was very successful in its early years. It was in such demand that it was able to increase the frequency of its publications in 1932. However, in 1938 the journal appeared to be running its course and the publishers ceased their support.

==Later life==
In 1933 Febvre was appointed to a chair at the Collège de France. He published vigorously throughout the 1930s and early 40s, although World War II interrupted his work (following the Fall of France, parts of the country were occupied by Germany). 

In accordance with the Nazi regime, French editorial boards were to be stripped of Jews in accordance with German racial policies; while Bloch advocated disobedience, Febvre was passionate about the survival of &quot;Annales&quot; at any cost. He believed that it was worth making concessions to keep the journal afloat and to keep France&#x27;s intellectual life alive. Bloch, forced to accede, turned the &quot;Annales&quot; over to the sole editorship of Febvre, who then changed the journal&#x27;s name to &quot;Mélanges d&#x27;Histoire Sociale.&quot; Bloch was forced to write for it under the pseudonym Marc Fougères.

In June 1944, Marc Bloch was executed, and so Febvre became the man who carried the &quot;Annales&quot; into the post-war period, most notably by training Fernand Braudel and co-founding the &quot;VI section&quot; of the École Pratique des Hautes Etudes, later known as École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS). 

Febvre died in 1956 in Saint-Amour, France, where the College Lucien Febvre and Avenue Lucien Febvre are named after him. He is also honoured in street names in Besancon and Strasbourg.

<doc id="867851" wikidata="Q489763" url="?curid=867851" title="Cleft sentence">
<text>A cleft sentence is a complex sentence (one having a main clause and a dependent clause) that has a meaning that could be expressed by a simple sentence. Clefts typically put a particular constituent into focus. In spoken language, this focusing is often accompanied by a special intonation.

In English, a cleft sentence can be constructed as follows:

:&quot;it&quot; + conjugated form of &quot;to be&quot; + &quot;X&quot; + subordinate clause

where &quot;it&quot; is a cleft pronoun and &quot;X&quot; is the cleft constituent, usually a noun phrase (although it can also be a prepositional phrase, and in some cases an adjectival or adverbial phrase). The focus is on &quot;X&quot;, or else on the subordinate clause or some element of it. For example:
*&quot;It&#x27;s Joey (whom) we&#x27;re looking for.&quot;
*&quot;It&#x27;s money that I love.&quot;
*&quot;It was from John that she heard the news.&quot;

Furthermore, one might also describe a cleft sentence as inverted. That is to say, it has its dependent clause in front of the main clause. So, rather than (for example):

*&quot;We didn&#x27;t meet her until we arrived at the hotel.&quot;

the cleft would be:

*&quot;It wasn&#x27;t until we arrived at the hotel that&quot; (or &quot;when&quot;) &quot;we met her.&quot;

== Types ==

English is very rich in cleft constructions. Below are examples of some types of clefts found in English, though the list is not exhaustive. See Lambrecht 2001 for a comprehensive survey, Collins 1991 for an in-depth analysis of it-clefts and wh-clefts in English, and Calude 2009 for an investigation of clefts in spoken English.

=== It-cleft ===
In English, it-clefts consist of the pronoun &quot;it&quot;, followed by a form of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, a cleft constituent, and a complementizer, which introduces a relative clause that is attributed to the cleft phrase. It-clefts introduce two meanings parts: (1) a presupposition that the property in the clause following the complementiser holds of some entity; and (ii) an assertion that this property holds of the entity denoted by the cleft constituent.

* English it-cleft: &quot;It was John that Mary saw.&quot;

=== Wh-cleft/Pseudo-cleft ===
In English, pseudo-clefts consist of an interrogative clause in the subject position, followed by a form of the verb &quot;be&quot;, followed by the focused element that appears at the end of the sentence. The prototypical pseudo-cleft construction uses &quot;what&quot;, while other wh-words like &quot;who&quot;, &quot;where&quot; etc. and their pro-form equivalents like &quot;thing&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;place&quot; etc. are used less frequently. Pseudo-clefts are tools for presenting and highlighting new information, serving as the building blocks of a coherent discourse progression, and a rhetorical toolkit to construct an authorial stance, being a grammatical resource for making evaluative meaning.

* English wh-cleft/pseudo-cleft: &quot;What Mary bought was a first edition.&quot;

=== Reversed wh-cleft/Inverted pseudo-cleft ===
In English, an inverted pseudo-cleft consists of the identical structure to pseudoclefting, however, the two strings around the verb &quot;be&quot; are inverted. The focus element has been brought to the front of the sentence, and the clause is sentence final.

* English reversed wh-cleft/inverted pseudo-cleft:

# &quot;A Fiat is what he wanted to buy.&quot;
# &quot;Alice was who John was talking to.&quot;

=== All-cleft ===
In English, all-cleft sentences are related to pseudo-clefts in which they are constructed with the subject of the sentence embedded in the phrase and expressed with the verb &quot;to be&quot;. Where pseudo-clefts begin with a wh-phrase (&quot;what&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, &quot;who&quot;), all-clefts begin with the use of the word &quot;all&quot;.

* English &quot;all&quot;-cleft:

# &quot;All he wanted to buy was a Fiat.&quot;
# &quot;All they want is a holiday.&quot;

=== Inferential cleft ===
In English, inferential clefts involve a subordinate clause that is embedded as a complement of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, and the sentence begins with the subject &quot;it&quot;. Oftentimes, an inferential cleft will include an adverb such as &quot;only, simply&quot; or &quot;just.&quot; While they are analyzed in written text, data on inferential clefts are often found in spoken language and act as a subordinate clause of the subject they are inferring.

* English inferential cleft:

# &quot;It is not that he loves her. It&#x27;s just that he has a way with her that is different.&quot;
# &quot;It was just that it was raining.&quot;

=== There-cleft ===
Looking at existential sentences, in all languages, they are understood to belong to a grammatically distinct construction, which is utilized to express existential positions. Cleft-sentences in English contain existential sentences that have a &quot;dummy there&quot; as a subject, &quot;be&quot; as a main verb, and an NP in the post-verbal complement position. To elaborate, &quot;dummy there&quot; can be distinguished as an adverbial, pronoun, and subject. Likewise, &quot;be&quot; can be distinguished as a main verb, and may contain other intransitive verbs such as &quot;come&quot;, &quot;remain&quot;, &quot;exist&quot;, &quot;arise&quot;, and &quot;stand&quot;. Lastly, &quot;post-verbal NP&quot; depends on the discourse of the entity or entities that refer to the novel information it is expressing.
* English dummy &quot;there&quot;-cleft:

# &quot;There&#x27;s nobody there.&quot;
# &quot;There seemed to be nothing he couldn&#x27;t do.&quot;

* English &quot;be there&quot;-cleft: &quot;There comes a stage when a player should move on.&quot;
* English post-verbal NP &quot;there&quot;-cleft: &quot;There was George Talbot and there was Ted.&quot;
* English &quot;there&quot;-cleft: &quot;And then there&#x27;s a new house he wanted to build.&quot;
=== If-because cleft ===

* English &quot;if-because&quot; cleft: &quot;If he wants to be an actor it&#x27;s because he wants to be famous.&quot;

=== Other languages ===
Traditional accounts of cleft structures classify these according to the elements involved following English-centric analyses (such as &quot;wh-words&quot;, the pronoun &quot;it&quot;, the quantifier &quot;all&quot;, and so on). This makes it difficult to conduct cross-linguistic investigations of clefts since these elements do not exist in all other languages, which has led to a proposal for a revision of existing cleft taxonomy (see Calude 2009).

However, not all languages are so rich in cleft types as English, and some employ other means for focusing specific constituents, such as topicalization, word order changes, focusing particles and so on (see Miller 1996). &quot;Cleftability in Language&quot; (2009) by Cheng Luo presents a cross-linguistic discussion of cleftability.

== Structural issues ==
The role of the cleft pronoun (&quot;it&quot; in the case of English) is controversial, and some believe it to be referential, while others treat it as a dummy pronoun or empty element. The former analysis has come to be termed the &quot;expletive&quot; view, whereas the latter is referred to as the &quot;extraposition&quot; approach. Hedberg (2002) proposes a hybrid approach, combining ideas from both takes on the status of the cleft pronoun. She shows that it can have a range of scopes (from semantically void to full reference) depending on the context in which it is used.

Similarly controversial is the status of the subordinate clause, often termed the &quot;cleft clause&quot;. While most would agree that the cleft clause in wh-clefts can be analysed as some kind of relative clause (free or fused or headless), there is disagreement as to the exact nature of the relative. Traditionally, the wh-word in a cleft such as &quot;What you need is a good holiday&quot;, pertaining to the relative &quot;What you need&quot;, is understood to be the first constituent of the relative clause, and to function as its head.

Bresnan and Grimshaw (1978) posit a different analysis. They suggest that the relative clause is headed (rather than headless), with wh-word being located outside the clause proper and functioning as its head. Miller (1996) also endorses this approach, citing cross-linguistic evidence that the wh-word functions as indefinite deictics.

The cleft clause debate gets more complex with it-clefts, where researchers struggle to even agree as to the type of clause that is involved: the traditionalists claim it to be a relative clause (Huddleston and Pullum 2002), while others reject this on the basis of a lack of noun phrase antecedent (Quirk et al. 1985, Sornicola 1988, Miller 1999), as exemplified below:
* &quot;It was because he was ill that we decided to return.&quot;
* &quot;It was in September that he first found out about it.&quot;
* &quot;It was with great reluctance that Maria accepted the invitation.&quot;

Finally, the last element of a cleft is the cleft constituent, which typically corresponds to the focus. As mentioned earlier, the focused part of a cleft is typically a noun phrase, but may in fact, turn up to be just about anything:
* Prepositional phrase: &quot;It was on foot that he went there.&quot;
* Adverbial phrase: &quot;It was greedily and speedily that Homer Simpson drank his beer.&quot;
* Non-finite clause: &quot;It is to address a far-reaching problem that Oxfam is launching this campaign.&quot;
* Gerund: &quot;It could be going home early or slacking off at work that the boss reacted to.&quot;
* Adverbial clause: &quot;It was because she was so lonely all the time that she decided to move out.&quot;

== Information structure ==
Clefts have been described as &quot;equative&quot; (Halliday 1976), &quot;stative&quot; (Delin and Oberlander 1995) and as &quot;variable-value pairs&quot;, where the cleft constituent gives a variable expressed by the cleft clause (Herriman 2004, Declerck 1994, Halliday 1994). A major area of interest with regard to cleft constructions involves their information structure. The concept of &quot;information structure&quot; relates to the type of information encoded in a particular utterance, that can be one of these three:
* NEW information: things that the speaker/writer expects their hearer/reader might not already know
* GIVEN information: information that the speaker/writer expects the hearer/reader may be familiar with
* INFERRABLE information: information that the speaker/writer may expect the hearer/reader to be able to infer either from world knowledge or from previous discourse

The reason why information structure plays such an important role in the area of clefts is largely due to the fact that the organisation of information structure is tightly linked to the clefts&#x27; function as focusing tools used by speakers/writers to draw attention to salient parts of their message.

While it may be reasonable to assume that the variable of a cleft (that is, the material encoded by cleft clauses) may be typically GIVEN and its value (expressed by the cleft constituent) is NEW, it is not always so. Sometimes, neither element contains new information, as is in some demonstrative clefts, e.g., &quot;That is what I think&quot; and sometimes it is the cleft clause that contains the NEW part of the message, as in &quot;And that&#x27;s when I got sick&quot; (Calude 2009). Finally, in some constructions, it is the equation between cleft clause and cleft constituent that brings about the newsworthy information, rather than any of the elements of the cleft themselves (Lambrecht 2001).

==Other languages==
=== Mandarin ===
The &quot;shì...de&quot; construction in Mandarin is used to produce the equivalent of cleft sentences. However, in traditional grammar, &quot;shì...de&quot; clefts were seen as a construction with a function in reference to the construction as a whole. Both &quot;shì&quot;, the copula, and &quot;de&quot; can occur in other contexts that express information-structural categories, but they are sometimes hard to distinguish from &quot;shì...de&quot; clefts. In addition, certain constructions with relative clauses have been referred to as &quot;pseudo-cleft&quot; constructions. See for details.

Examples:



=== Spanish ===
Several constructions play the role of cleft sentences in Spanish. A very common resource is the adding of &quot;es que&quot; (time-dependent). Similar to English cleft sentences, time-dependent cleft constructions in Spanish also share a temporal relationship between the verb of the relative clause and the copula.

From uncleft &quot;¿Adónde fuiste?&quot;

Another mechanism is the use of the identificating structure, or relative pronouns, &quot;el/la que&quot;, &quot;el/la cual&quot; as well as the neuters: &quot;lo que&quot; and &quot;lo cual&quot;. This form of cleft construction highlights an importance between the entity and the number and gender of said entity that is uttered in a cleft sentence.


Possible uncleft variants: &quot;No quiero ir&quot;, &quot;Ir no quiero&quot;

Furthermore, one can also utilize &quot;cuando&quot; and &quot;donde&quot; when one wants to refer to &quot;that&quot; in a frame of time or place.

&quot;&quot;Fue en Londres donde nací&quot; (It was in London that I was born), possible uncleft variants &quot;Nací en Londres&quot;

=== French ===
In French, when a cleft is used to reply to a wh-question, it can appear in a complete form Matrix &#x27;C&#x27;est XP&#x27; + relative clause &#x27;que/qui YP&#x27; or in a reduced form Matrix &#x27;C&#x27;est XP&#x27;.

Example:
*&quot;C&#x27;est Jean que je cherche&quot; (It&#x27;s Jean whom I&#x27;m looking for)
*&quot;C&#x27;est à Paris que j&#x27;habite&quot;&quot; (It&#x27;s in Paris where I live)
Example with Gloss:

Cleft sentences are the most natural way to answer a wh-question in French. For example, if one were to ask:

a.

It would be answered with the following it-cleft:

b.

=== Japanese ===
The &quot;X no wa (ga)&quot; construction in Japanese is frequently used to produce the equivalent of cleft sentences. In addition, a gap precedes its filler in both &quot;subject cleft (SC) constructions&quot; and &quot;object cleft (OC) constructions&quot;. Japanese speakers have reported that there is an object gap preference in Japanese cleft constructions due to temporal structural ambiguities in subject clefts.

Example:

Example of a subject cleft construction:

Example of an object cleft construction:

===Goidelic languages===
The construction is frequent in the Goidelic languages (Scottish Gaelic, Irish, and Manx), much more so than in English, and can be used in ways that would be ambiguous or ungrammatical in English: almost any element of a sentence can be clefted. That sometimes carries over into the local varieties of English (Highland English, Lowland Scots, Scottish English, Hiberno-English).

The following examples from Scottish Gaelic are based on the sentence , &quot;Iain heard the music last night&quot;:

* (&quot;It&#x27;s Iain who heard the music last night&quot; &quot;e.g. as opposed to Mary&quot;)
* (&quot;It&#x27;s the music that Iain heard last night&quot; &quot;e.g. as opposed to the speech&quot;)
* (&quot;It&#x27;s last night that Iain heard the music&quot; &quot;e.g. as opposed to last week&quot;)
* (&quot;It&#x27;s heard that Iain the music last night&quot; &quot;e.g. as opposed to making the music&quot;)

===Tagalog===

Cleft sentences in Tagalog are copula constructions in which the focused element serves as the predicate of the sentence.

In the examples in (1) and (2), the foci are in bold. The remaining portions of the cleft sentences in (1) and (2) are noun phrases that contain headless relative clauses. (NB: Tagalog does not have an overt copula.)

This construction is also used for WH-questions in Tagalog, when the WH-word used in the question is either &quot;sino&quot; &quot;who&quot; or &quot;ano&quot; &quot;what&quot;, as illustrated in (3) and (4).

<doc id="867853" wikidata="Q5426833" url="?curid=867853" title="FOCUS">
<text>FOCUS is a fourth-generation programming language (4GL) computer programming language and development environment that is used to build database queries. Produced by Information Builders Inc., it was originally developed for data handling and analysis on the IBM mainframe. Subsequently versions for minicomputers and such as the VAX and other platforms were implemented. FOCUS was later extended to personal computers and (in 1997) to the World Wide Web: the WebFOCUS product.

==History==
Information Builders&#x27;s FOCUS product began as an alternate product to Mathematica&#x27;s RAMIS, the first Fourth-generation programming language (4GL).

National CSS (NCSS), a Time-sharing vendor, licensed rights to make RAMIS available on its VP/CSS system.

At some point Mathematica changed its licensing price.

The interested parties were:
* NCSS, which was marketing RAMIS (and other products) for use on their time-sharing system
* Mathematica, owner of RAMIS
* Key developers/programmers of RAMIS
** some stayed with Mathematica
** others left to form the company that became Information Builders, known for its FOCUS product

===Relation to other 4GLs===
RAMIS was the direct ancestor of FOCUS.

Gerald D. Cohen and Peter Mittelman were the principal developers of RAMIS while working at Mathematica Products Group in 1970. RAMIS was licensed by Mathematica to a number of in-house clients (including Nabisco and AT&amp;T Corporation), and was also offered by the National CSS timesharing company. In October 1975 Cohen left Mathematica and formed Information Builders, after which he recreated the product he had built at Mathematica in the form of FOCUS,
which was very similar to RAMIS: &quot;the same bugs and the same misspelled error messages.&quot;
The syntax of FOCUS in its simplest elements is almost a direct clone of the syntax of RAMIS bearing a resemblance similar to the differences between various early dialects of SQL. At the same time, NCSS decided to work on its own product, later called NOMAD. All three products flourished during the 1970s and early 1980s, with FOCUS also being offered on a time-sharing basis via
Tymeshare.

Mathematica&#x27;s time ran out in the mid-80s, and NCSS also failed, a victim of the personal computing revolution which obviated commercial timesharing.

RAMIS was sold to a series of companies, ultimately landing with Computer Associates. NOMAD suffered a similar fate. FOCUS, under Cohen&#x27;s direction, continued to flourish by expanding their product line.

Loosely competitive with SAS, FOCUS never quite reached the same degree of mainstream adoption, perhaps because it had only basic analytical and statistical functions and lacked the wide array of specialized analytic tools which made SAS the standard in fields such as pharmaceutical clinical trials. Instead, FOCUS concentrated on extreme flexibility in data import and export as well as ad hoc end-user reporting.

===Integration===
Software packages with which &quot;FOCUS&quot; has linked and integrated include:
* Excel
* AJAX

===Business Intelligence competitors===
Business intelligence software competitors include:
==Description==
Although FOCUS resembles other data access and analysis tools, such as SQL and SAS, it also includes report and chart display and presentation features. It automates the process of identifying files to the operating system, opening the input file, reading the next record, opening the output file, writing the next record, and closing the files. This basic operation allows the user/programmer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record, in effect working almost entirely within an implicit program loop that runs for each record, somewhat like RPG (Report Program Generator). Other procedures operate on the dataset as a whole, for instance printing or statistical analysis, and merely require the user/programmer to identify the dataset.

Compared to general-purpose programming languages, this structure allows the user/programmer to be less familiar with the technical details of the data and how it is stored, and relatively more familiar with the information contained in the data. This blurs the line between user and programmer, appealing to individuals whose work roles are in business or research rather than information technology. This in turn has the double edged result of allowing rapid answers to business or research questions, even ones requiring several iterations to get from the initial results to a final answer; but also can contribute to the construction of a large body of poorly written and/or difficult to maintain source code.
===Master File Description (MFD)===
A feature that was unique at the time is that FOCUS features the ability for the user to construct a data description file (called a &quot;master file description&quot;) referring to the actual data file, or even several different data description files addressing the same data file in different ways, rather than the usual practice of having the file structure hard-coded into the program.

In this way, files of any structure from any source can be accessed or produced in many different ways, eliminating much of the data manipulation (for example concatenation, or parsing) at times required with other earlier programming languages. For instance, the same actual data file can be accessed (read or write) as each record being an 80 byte text string, or as 40 2 character numerical fields, other as 10 8-byte floating point numbers, etc., by the user simply re-writing the appropriate master file description as needed.

===Samples===
* (batch)
** PRINT LASTNAME FIRSTNAME AREACODE PHONUM NOTES
** PRINT PROJNAME AND PROJCOST BY CUSTNAME SUBTOTAL PROJCOST BY CUSTID

The second command would produce a report with headings
CUSTNAME CUSTID PROJNAME PROJCOST
::followed by one or more lines of detail, followed by
:: _TOTAL_ CUSTNAME xxxxx (and $z,zzz.zz for that CUSTNAME)
:::The bottom of the report would have the total for ALL projects.

* (interactive)
:: MODIFY FILE PHONEIDX
:: PROMPT AREACODE PHONUM LASTNAME FIRSTNAME NOTES
:: MATCH AREACODE PHONUM
:: ON MATCH REJECT
:: ON NOMATCH INCLUDE
:: DATA

There are keywords to facilitate modification (or deletion) of existing data, and the prompting and error messages from the interactive session can be customized.

==WebFOCUS==
In 1997, a web-based version of FOCUS was introduced called &quot;WebFOCUS&quot; which built on the data access and reporting foundation of FOCUS, expanding these to a visually oriented thin-client paradigm accessible from any web browser.

WebFOCUS&#x27;s language has both a &quot;procedural&quot; and &quot;non-procedural&quot; command structure. The former is for more immediate execution, whereas the latter &quot;are placed into a stack of memory for later execution.&quot;

<text>Clan Lord is the Macintosh&#x27;s first massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), made by Delta Tao Software. It was started in the late 1990s and is still going, with a regular update every 4 weeks. There is also a client for Windows. In 2001 it was voted one of the top ten Mac games of all time in GAMES Magazine. By the end of 2007, player participation dropped below 100 concurrently online. The game world and characters&#x27; options in it grow with each update. The game encourages cooperation and community and has only minimal opportunities for player-vs.-player (PvP) activity. On January 17, 2009, it was announced that Delta Tao would no longer charge monthly fees for play. Since then player numbers have increased from the previous low player base and it maintains a steady stream of online players.

As of 2006, there are Windows and Java ports maintained by the Arindal development team. The Windows client is also running under Linux using Wine.

==Setting==
Game characters have been exiled by the mad Emperor Mobius to the Lok&#x27;Groton Islands for &quot;crimes&quot; against the Empire. Characters are of seven races: Human, Dwarf, Sylvan, Halfling, Thoom, Ghorak Zo, and The People. Exiles may choose to pursue one of three classes: Fighter, Healer, or Mystic, and may also choose sub-classes for the Fighter class: Ranger, Champion or Blood-Mage. In addition to the dangers of the natural island wildlife, exiles must deal with other sentient beings, including the warlike Orgas, the Darshak pirates, the Undine (i.e., undead), and a group of ancient and powerful sorcerers.

==Game mechanics==
Clan Lord&#x27;s battle system is primarily based on character skill choices, rather than the items equipped by the character. Items are used more for cosmetic purposes (clothing) and access to additional abilities (e.g. a chain to drag fallen exiles to safety). Clan Lord does not have a level system with multiple skill improvements per level. Rather, skills are trained one at a time in small increments known as ranks. It is not uncommon for exiles to have thousands of ranks. Communication occurs through speech bubbles near an exile&#x27;s sprite, with options for talking, yelling, thought bubbles, whispering, and performing actions. A sunstone will allow the user to send messages directly to other exiles.

===Status bars===
There are three quantities determining an exile&#x27;s status: health, balance, and spirit, tracked through bars in the interface. The total quantity and rate of recovery of each of these can be trained by certain classes through training. Health is decreased by taking damage, and restored through healing. When the health bar is empty, the exile falls, and cannot move or fight until healed, or giving up and returning to town through Purgatory with a loss of experience. Balance is used when attacking an enemy. Spirit is used by the Healer class when healing self or others, and by the Mystic class and sub-classed Fighters for many of their respective abilities. Balance and spirit continually recharge.

===Fighting===
Clan Lord&#x27;s fighting system operates on a simple bump-to-attack system. Played in third-person view, the player moves or clicks the mouse in the direction he or she wants the exile to move. When running into an enemy, the exile will swing a weapon, if one is equipped. All classes can do this; however, those in the Fighter class have many more training options, and more powerful training options, than Healers and Mystics. This fighting system trades complexity for control, with strategy arising from the precise control the player has over the exile&#x27;s movements. Choosing a Fighter sub-class adds skills which can be used during battle.

===Healing===
Self-healing abilities in Clan Lord are limited. Instead, those of the Healer class work to keep a group of exiles alive throughout a hunt or to repel invaders. Healers start with a moonstone, an item that heals when bumping into an exile, and can be used to self-heal. Later, Healers can gain ranged healing items and abilities. Healing other exiles decreases the Healer&#x27;s health and spirit, though the health decrease is less than what is gained by the other exile. Healers can also train in the ability to be healed particularly quickly by other Healers, allowing a pair or team of Healers to soak up large amounts of damage without falling.

===Mystics===
Many of the abilities of mystics are intentionally shrouded in secrecy. However, there is some information that is easily seen by all. Mystics can give exiles near them a temporary boost in the ability to hit enemies with a Rod of Akea, or amount of balance with a Rod of Ballou. They can locate exiles with a Skristal, most often used to find fallen exiles who can then be rescued. They can also provide sunstone creation and repair services.

<doc id="867860" wikidata="Q178470" url="?curid=867860" title="Netbook">
<text>A netbook is a small-sized laptop computer; they were primarily sold from 2007 until around 2013, designed mostly as a means of accessing the Internet and being significantly less expensive than regular-sized laptops.

At their inception in late 2007, as smaller-than-typical laptop computers optimized for low weight and low cost, netbooks began appearing without certain then-standard laptop features (such as an optical drive), and with less computing power than in full-sized laptops. They ranged in size from about 5&quot; screen diagonal to 12&quot;, with a typical weight of about (), and were often significantly less expensive than other laptops. Soon after their appearance, netbooks grew in size and features, and converged with smaller laptops and subnotebooks until the specifications were so similar that there was little distinction between the devices. At their peak, the low cost gave them a significant portion of the laptop computer market.

When Windows 7 released, netbook manufacturers had to increase specifications in order for their devices to run it. This had the effect of pushing netbooks into a market niche where they had few distinctive advantages over traditional laptops. With these constraints and the increasing popularity of tablet computers in 2011, it led to declining sales of netbooks. By the end of 2012, few new laptops were marketed as &quot;netbooks&quot;, and the term disappeared from common usage.

== History ==
While Psion had unrelated netBook line of machines, the use of the broad marketing term &quot;netbook&quot;, began in 2007 when Asus unveiled the Asus Eee PC. Originally designed for emerging markets, the device weighed about and featured a display, a keyboard approximately 85% the size of a normal keyboard, a solid-state drive and a custom version of Linux with a simplified user interface geared towards consumer use. Following the Eee PC, Everex launched its Linux-based CloudBook; Windows XP and Windows Vista models were also introduced and MSI released the Wind—others soon followed suit.

The OLPC project followed the same market goals laid down by the eMate 300 eight years earlier. Known for its innovation in producing a durable, cost- and power-efficient netbook for developing countries, it is regarded as one of the major factors that led more top computer hardware manufacturers to begin creating low-cost netbooks for the consumer market.

When the first Asus Eee PC sold over 300,000 units in four months, companies such as Dell and Acer took note and began producing their own inexpensive netbooks. And while the OLPC XO-1 targets a different audience than do the other manufacturers&#x27; netbooks, it appears that OLPC is now facing competition. Developing countries now have a large choice of vendors, from which they can choose which low-cost netbook they prefer.

By late 2008, netbooks began to take market share away from notebooks. It was more successful than earlier &quot;mini notebooks,&quot; most likely because of lower cost and greater compatibility with mainstream laptops.

Having peaked at about 20% of the portable computer market, netbooks started to slightly lose market share (within the category) in early 2010, coinciding with the appearance and success of the iPad. Technology commentator Ross Rubin argued two and a half years later in Engadget that &quot;Netbooks never got any respect. While Steve Jobs rebuked the netbook at the iPad&#x27;s introduction, the iPad owes a bit of debt to the little laptops. The netbook demonstrated the potential of an inexpensive, portable second computing device, with a screen size of about 10 inches, intended primarily for media consumption and light productivity.&quot; Although some manufacturers directly blamed competition from the iPad, some analysts pointed out that larger, fully fledged laptops had entered the price range of netbooks at about the same time.

The 11.6-inch MacBook Air, introduced in late 2010, compared favorably to many netbooks in terms of processing power but also ergonomics, at 2.3 pounds being lighter than some 10-inch netbooks, owing in part to the integration of the flash storage chips on the main logic board. It was described as a superlative netbook (or at least as what a netbook should be) by several technology commentators, even though Apple has never referred to it as such, sometimes describing it—in the words of Steve Jobs—as &quot;the third kind of notebook.&quot; The entry-level model had a MSRP of $999, costing significantly more than the average netbook, as much as three or four times more.

In 2011 tablet sales overtook netbooks for the first time, and in 2012 netbook sales fell by 25 percent, year-on-year. The sustained decline since 2010 had been most pronounced in the United States and in Western Europe, while Latin America was still showing some modest growth. In December 2011, Dell announced that it was exiting the netbook market. In May 2012, Toshiba announced it was doing the same, at least in the United States. An August 2012 article by John C. Dvorak in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; claimed that the term &quot;netbook&quot; is &quot;nearly gone from the lexicon already&quot;, having been superseded in the market place largely by the more powerful (and MacBook Air inspired) Ultrabook—described as &quot;a netbook on steroids&quot;—and to a lesser extent by tablets. In September 2012 Asus, Acer and MSI announced that they will stop manufacturing 10-inch netbooks. Simultaneously Asus announced they would stop developing all Eee PC products, instead focusing on their mixed tablet-netbook Transformer line.

With the introduction of Chromebooks, major manufacturers produced the new laptops for the same segment of the market that netbooks serviced. Chromebooks, a variation on the network computer concept, in the form of a netbook, require internet connections for full functionality. Chromebooks became top selling laptops in 2014. The threat of Google ChromeOS based Chromebooks prompted Microsoft to revive and revamp netbooks with &quot;Windows 8.1 with Bing&quot;. HP re-entered the non-Chromebook netbook market with the &quot;Stream 11&quot; in 2014..

=== Educational use ===
In Australia, the New South Wales Department of Education and Training, in partnership with Lenovo, provided Year 9 (high school) students in government high schools with Lenovo S10e netbooks in 2009, Lenovo Mini 10 netbooks in 2010, Lenovo Edge 11 netbooks in 2011 and a modified Lenovo X130e netbook in 2012, each preloaded with software including Microsoft Office and Adobe Systems&#x27; Creative Suite 4. These were provided under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s Digital Education Revolution, or DER. The netbooks ran Windows 7 Enterprise. These netbooks were secured with Computrace Lojack for laptops that the police can use to track the device if it is lost or stolen. The NSW DET retains ownership of these netbooks until the student graduates from Year 12, when the student can keep it. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago—Prime Minister Kamla Persad Bisseser—is also providing HP laptops to form 1 Students (11-year-olds) with the same police trackable software as above.

Greece provided all 13-year-old students (middle school, or &quot;gymnasium&quot;, freshmen) and their teachers with netbooks in 2009 through the &quot;Digital Classroom Initiative&quot;. Students were given one unique coupon each, with which they redeemed the netbook of their choice, up to a €450 price ceiling, in participating shops throughout the country. These netbooks came bundled with localized versions of either Windows XP (or higher) or open source (e.g. Linux) operating systems, wired and wireless networking functionality, antivirus protection, preactivated parental controls, and an educational software package.

== Hardware ==

Netbooks typically have less powerful hardware than larger laptop computers and do not include an optical disc drive that contemporaneous laptop computers often had. Netbooks were some of the first machines to substitute solid-state storage devices, instead of the traditional hard disk drive commonly found on laptop and desktop computers at the time. This was due to solid-state drives being smaller, more power efficient, and more shock resistant. Unlike modern solid-state drives, these early models often did &quot;not&quot; offer better performance.

Almost all netbooks supported Wi-Fi and some supported Mobile broadband. Some also include Ethernet and/or modems.

Most netbooks used low-end, x86 processors focused on low power consumption. The majority of early netbooks typically used processors from the Intel Atom line, but some used competing processors from AMD, including netbook APUs, or VIA Technologies, including the C7 and Nano. Some very low-cost netbooks use a system-on-a-chip Vortex86 processor designed for embedded systems. A few netbooks used non-x86 processors based on ARM or MIPS architectures.

==Operating systems==

===Windows===

Microsoft announced on April 8, 2008, that, despite the impending end of retail availability for the operating system that June, it would continue to license low-cost copies of Windows XP Home Edition to OEMs through October 2010 (one year after the release of Windows 7) for what it defined as &quot;ultra low-cost personal computers&quot;—a definition carrying restrictions on screen size and processing power. The move served primarily to counter the use of low-cost Linux distributions on netbooks and create a new market segment for Windows devices, whilst ensuring that the devices did not cannibalize the sales of higher-end PCs running Windows Vista. In 2009, over 90% (96% claimed by Microsoft as of February 2009) of netbooks in the United States were estimated to ship with Windows XP.

For Windows 8, in a ploy to counter ChromeOS-based netbooks and low-end Android tablets, Microsoft began to offer no-cost Windows licenses to OEMs for devices with screens smaller than 9 inches in size. Additionally, Microsoft began to offer low-cost licenses for a variant of the operating system set up to use Microsoft&#x27;s Bing search engine by default.

Windows CE has also been used in netbooks, due to its reduced feature set.

===Android===

Google&#x27;s Android software platform, designed for mobile telephone handsets, has been demonstrated on an ASUS Eee PC and its version of the Linux operating system contains policies for mobile internet devices including the original Asus Eee PC 701. ASUS has allocated engineers to develop an Android-based netbook. In May 2009 a contractor of Dell announced it is porting Adobe Flash Lite to Android for Dell netbooks. Acer announced Android netbooks to be available in Q3/2009. In July 2009, a new project, Android-x86, was created to provide an open source solution for Android on the x86 platform, especially for netbooks.

===ChromeOS===
In 2011, Google introduced ChromeOS, a Linux-based operating system designed particularly for netbook-like devices marketed as &quot;Chromebooks&quot;. The platform is designed to leverage online services, cloud computing, and its namesake Chrome web browser as its shell—so much so that the operating system initially used a full screen web browser window as its interface, and contained limited offline functionality. Later versions of ChromeOS introduced a traditional desktop interface and a platform allowing &quot;native&quot; packaged software written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to be developed for the platform.

===Other===
Netbooks have sparked the development of several Linux variants or completely new distributions, which are optimized for small screen use and the limited processing power of the Atom or ARM processors which typically power netbooks. Examples include Ubuntu Netbook Edition, EasyPeasy, Joli OS and MeeGo. Both Joli OS and MeeGo purport to be &quot;social oriented&quot; or social networking operating systems rather than traditional &quot;office work production&quot; operating systems. Netbook users can also install other UNIX-based operating systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Darwin.

Since 2010, major netbook manufacturers no longer install or support Linux in the United States. The reason for this change of stance is unclear, although it coincides with the availability of a &#x27;netbook&#x27; version of Windows XP, and a later Windows 7 Starter and a strong marketing push for the adoption of this OS in the netbook market. However, companies targeting niche markets, such as System76 and ZaReason, continue to pre-install Linux on the devices they sell.

The Cloud operating system attempted to capitalize on the minimalist aspect of netbooks. The user interface was limited to a browser application only.

Mac OS X has been demonstrated running on various netbooks as a result of the OSx86 project, although this is in violation of the operating system&#x27;s end-user license agreement. Apple has complained to sites hosting information on how to install OS X onto non-Apple hardware (including &quot;Wired&quot; and YouTube) who have reacted and removed content in response. One article nicknamed a netbook running OS X a &quot;Hackintosh.&quot;

==Use==
A June 2009 NPD study found that 60% of netbook buyers never take their netbooks out of the house.

Special &quot;children&#x27;s&quot; editions of netbooks have been released under Disney branding; their low cost (less at risk), lack of DVD player (less to break) and smaller keyboards (closer to children&#x27;s hand sizes) are viewed as significant advantages for that target market. The principal objection to netbooks in this context is the lack of good video performance for streaming online video in current netbooks and a lack of speed with even simple games. Adults browsing for text content are less dependent on video content than small children who cannot read.

Netbooks offer several distinct advantages in educational settings. First, their compact size and weight make for an easy fit in student work areas. Similarly, their small size makes netbooks easier to transport than heavier, larger sized traditional laptops. In addition, prices ranging from $200–$600 mean the affordability of netbooks can be a relief to school budget makers. Despite the small size and price, netbooks are fully capable of accomplishing most school-related tasks, including word processing, presentations, access to the Internet, multimedia playback, and photo management.

== Trademarks and Psion lawsuit ==

In 1996 Psion started applying for trademarks for a line of &quot;netBook&quot; products that was later released in 1999. International trademarks were issued (including and EUTM 000428250) but the models failed to gain popularity and were discontinued by the time modern netbooks came about (except for providing accessories, maintenance and support to existing users). Similar marks were recently rejected by the USPTO citing a &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; under section 2(d).

Despite expert analysis that the mark is &quot;probably generic&quot;, Psion Teklogix issued cease and desist letters on December 23, 2008. This was heavily criticized, prompting the formation of the &quot;Save the Netbooks&quot; grassroots campaign which worked to reverse the Google AdWords ban, cancel the trademark and encourage continued generic use of the term. While preparing a &quot;Petition for Cancellation&quot; of they revealed that Dell had submitted one day before on the basis of abandonment, genericness and fraud. They later revealed Psion&#x27;s counter-suit against Intel, filed on February 27, 2009.

It was also revealed around the same time that Intel had also sued Psion Teklogix (US &amp; Canada) and Psion (UK) in the Federal Court on similar grounds. In addition to seeking cancellation of the trademark, Intel sought an order enjoining Psion from asserting any trademark rights in the term &quot;netbook&quot;, a declarative judgment regarding their use of the term, attorneys&#x27; fees, costs and disbursements and &quot;such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper&quot;.

On June 2, 2009, Psion announced that the suit had been settled out of court. Psion&#x27;s statement said that the company was withdrawing all of its trademark registrations for the term &quot;Netbook&quot; and that Psion agreed to &quot;waive all its rights against third parties in respect of past, current or future use&quot; of the term.

<text>Kris Holm (born July 15, 1973) is a Canadian best known for riding a unicycle in off-road conditions. He has ridden since 1985 and is considered one of the pioneers of off-road unicycling, and is the world&#x27;s best-known unicyclist. He is the founder of competitive unicycle trials (unicycle obstacle riding) and was the 1999 North American, 2002 World, and 2005 European unicycle trials champion. He also held the unicycle sidehop world record from 1998-2004 (since broken), and performed trials demonstrations with the Norco Factory Trials Team from 1998-2006.

==Career==
Holm first received a unicycle for his twelfth birthday, in 1985. Since then he has ridden off-road in many countries, including the summit of the highest mountain in Central America, the summit of the 3rd highest mountain in North America, trade-routes across the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, and on the Great Wall of China. In 2006, he climbed and attempted a unicycle descent of Licancabur, a volcano in Bolivia. In 2010, he competed against bikes in the 7-day BC Bike Race, becoming the first unicyclist to reach the podium in a major mountain bike race, with a 3rd-place finish (Men&#x27;s Solo, Challenge Category) on Stage 5. He retired from semi-professional riding in 2013 at the age of 40, but still rides actively.

Holm was the first rider to bring mountain unicycling to a mainstream audience through film, television, and magazine features, and has been an advocate for public awareness of his sport. He has appeared in over 200 media features since 1998, including 13 films screened at mountain film festivals and festival tours. This exposure caused a major increase in the worldwide popularity of unicycling. His film, &quot;Into the Thunder Dragon&quot;, was named &quot;One of the Top Twenty Adventure DVD&#x27;s of All Time&quot; in the December 2005 issue of &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;. He has also been featured in many mainstream print publications, including &quot;Sports Illustrated Adventure&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot;, &quot;ESPN Magazine&quot;, and &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot;.

In 1999 he founded Kris Holm Unicycles (KHU). Early models were prone to failure and breakages were common. KHU is now distributed around the world. KHU also sponsors a Factory Team, and offers the Evolution of Balance Award, a grant awarded annually to a team proposing a creative mountain unicycling adventure. KHU was the first Canadian company and first cycling brand to join One Percent for the Planet, an alliances of businesses donating 1% of gross revenue towards environmental causes. Holm has acted as an ambassador for the 1% brand since 2011.

His books include &quot;The Essential Guide to Mountain and Trials Unicycling&quot;, and chapters in &quot;Einradfahren: Moves &amp; Tricks für Fortgeschrittene&quot; (Meyer&amp;Meyer, 2010) and &quot;Adventurers of the 21st Century&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kris Holm graduated with a M.Sc. from the University of British Columbia in 2002, and works as a professional geoscientist while also managing his unicycling brand. He lives with his wife and daughter in Vancouver, Canada.

<doc id="867865" wikidata="Q160161" url="?curid=867865" title="Warsaw Ghetto Uprising">
<text>The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was the 1943 act of Jewish resistance in the Warsaw Ghetto in German-occupied Poland during World War II to oppose Nazi Germany&#x27;s final effort to transport the remaining ghetto population to the gas chambers of the Majdanek and Treblinka extermination camps.

After the Grossaktion Warsaw of summer 1942, in which more than a quarter of a million Jews were deported from the ghetto to Treblinka and murdered, the remaining Jews began to build bunkers and smuggle weapons and explosives into the ghetto. The left-wing Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB) and right-wing Jewish Military Union (ŻZW) formed and began to train. A small resistance effort to another roundup in January 1943 was partially successful and spurred Polish resistance groups to support the Jews in earnest.

The uprising started on 19 April when the ghetto refused to surrender to the police commander SS-Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, who ordered the destruction of the ghetto, block by block, ending on 16 May. A total of 13,000 Jews were killed, about half of them burnt alive or suffocated. Stroop reported 110 German casualties, including 17 killed.

The uprising was the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II. The Jews knew that victory was impossible and survival unlikely. Marek Edelman, the last surviving ŻOB commander who died in 2009, said their inspiration to fight was &quot;not to allow the Germans alone to pick the time and place of our deaths&quot;. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the uprising was &quot;one of the most significant occurrences in the history of the Jewish people&quot;.

== Background ==

In 1939, German authorities began to concentrate Poland&#x27;s population of over three million Jews into a number of extremely crowded ghettos located in large Polish cities. The largest of these, the Warsaw Ghetto, collected approximately 300,000–400,000 people into a densely packed, 3.3 km2 area of Warsaw. Thousands of Jews were killed by rampant disease and starvation under SS-und-Polizeiführer Odilo Globocnik and SS-Standartenführer Ludwig Hahn, even before the mass deportations from the ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp began.

The SS conducted many of the deportations during the operation code-named &quot;Grossaktion Warschau&quot;, between 23 July and 21 September 1942. Just before the operation began, the German &quot;Resettlement Commissioner&quot; SS-Sturmbannführer Hermann Höfle called a meeting of the Ghetto Jewish Council Judenrat and informed its leader, Adam Czerniaków, that he would require 7,000 Jews a day for &quot;resettlement to the East&quot;. Czerniaków committed suicide once he became aware of the true goal of the &quot;resettlement&quot; plan. Approximately 254,000–300,000 ghetto residents were murdered at Treblinka during the two-month-long operation. The &quot;Grossaktion&quot; was directed by SS-Oberführer Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg, the SS and police commander of the Warsaw area since 1941.

He was relieved of duty by SS-und-Polizeiführer Jürgen Stroop, sent to Warsaw by Heinrich Himmler on 17 April 1943. Stroop took over from von Sammern-Frankenegg following the failure of the latter to pacify the ghetto resistance.

When the deportations first began, members of the Jewish resistance movement met and decided not to fight the SS directives, believing that the Jews were being sent to labour camps and not to be murdered. But by the end of 1942, ghetto inhabitants learned that the deportations were part of an extermination process. Many of the remaining Jews decided to revolt. The first armed resistance in the ghetto occurred in January 1943.

== Uprising ==
=== January revolt ===
On 18 January 1943, the Germans began their second deportation of the Jews, which led to the first instance of armed insurgency within the ghetto. While Jewish families hid in their so-called &quot;bunkers&quot;, fighters of the ŻOB and ŻZW, resisted, engaging the Germans in direct clashes. Though the ŻZW and ŻOB suffered heavy losses (including some of their leaders), the Germans also took casualties, and the deportation was halted within a few days. About 1,200 Jews were killed, and about 5,000 deported, instead of the 8,000 planned by Germans. The fighters managed to kill about a dozen Germans and wound several dozen.

Hundreds of people in the Warsaw Ghetto were ready to fight, sparsely armed with handguns, gasoline bottles, and a few other weapons that had been smuggled into the ghetto by resistance fighters. Most of the Jewish fighters did not view their actions as an effective measure by which to save themselves, but rather as a battle for the honour of the Jewish people, and a protest against the world&#x27;s silence.

=== Preparations ===
The ŻZW and ŻOB built dozens of fighting posts and executed a number of Nazi collaborators, including Jewish Ghetto Police officers, members of the fake (German-sponsored and controlled) resistance organization Żagiew, as well as Gestapo and Abwehr agents (including the alleged agent and Judenrat associate Alfred Nossig, executed on 22 February 1943). The ŻOB established a prison to hold and execute traitors and collaborators. Józef Szeryński, former head of the Jewish Ghetto Police, committed suicide.

=== Main revolt ===


On 19 April 1943, on the eve of Passover, the police and SS auxiliary forces entered the ghetto. They were planning to complete the deportation action within three days, but were ambushed by Jewish insurgents firing and tossing Molotov cocktails and hand grenades from alleyways, sewers, and windows. The Germans suffered 59 casualties and their advance bogged down. Two of their combat vehicles (an armed conversion of a French-made Lorraine 37L light armored vehicle and an armored car) were set on fire by the insurgents&#x27; petrol bombs. The remaining Jews knew that the Germans would murder them and decided to resist to the last. While the uprising was underway, the Bermuda Conference was held by the Allies from 19 to 29 April 1943 to discuss the Jewish refugee problem. Discussions included the question of Jewish refugees who had been liberated by Allied forces and those who still remained in German-occupied Europe.

Following von Sammern-Frankenegg&#x27;s failure to contain the revolt, he lost his post as the SS and police commander of Warsaw. He was replaced by SS-Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, who rejected von Sammern-Frankenegg&#x27;s proposal to call in bomber aircraft from Kraków. He led a better-organized and reinforced ground attack.

During this fight on 22 April, SS officer Hans Dehmke was killed when gunfire detonated a hand grenade he was holding. When Stroop&#x27;s ultimatum to surrender was rejected by the defenders, his forces resorted to systematically burning houses block by block using flamethrowers and fire bottles, and blowing up basements and sewers. &quot;We were beaten by the flames, not the Germans,&quot; survivor Marek Edelman said in 2007; he was deputy commander of the ŻOB and escaped the ghetto in its last days. In 2003, he recalled: &quot;The sea of flames flooded houses and courtyards. ... There was no air, only black, choking smoke and heavy burning heat radiating from the red-hot walls, from the glowing stone stairs.&quot; The &quot;bunker wars&quot; lasted an entire month, during which German progress was slowed.

While the battle continued inside the ghetto, Polish resistance groups AK and GL engaged the Germans between 19 and 23 April at six different locations outside the ghetto walls, firing at German sentries and positions. In one attack, three units of the AK under the command of Captain Józef Pszenny (&quot;Chwacki&quot;) joined up in a failed attempt to breach the ghetto walls with explosives. Eventually, the ŻZW lost all of its commanders. On 29 April, the remaining fighters from the organization escaped the ghetto through the Muranowski tunnel and relocated to the Michalin forest. This event marked the end of significant fighting.

At this point, organized defense collapsed. Surviving fighters and thousands of remaining Jewish civilians took cover in the sewer system and in the many dugout hiding places hidden among the ruins of the ghetto, referred to as &quot;bunkers&quot; by Germans and Jews alike. The Germans used dogs to detect such hideouts, then usually dropped smoke bombs to force people out. Sometimes they flooded these so-called bunkers or destroyed them with explosives. On occasions, shootouts occurred. A number of captured fighters lobbed hidden grenades or fired concealed handguns after surrendering.

On 8 May, the Germans discovered a large dugout located at Miła 18 Street, which served as ŻOB&#x27;s main command post. Most of the organization&#x27;s remaining leadership and dozens of others committed mass suicide by ingesting cyanide, including Mordechaj Anielewicz, the chief commander of ŻOB. His deputy Marek Edelman escaped the ghetto through the sewers with a handful of comrades two days later.

On 10 May, Szmul Zygielbojm, a Bundist member of the Polish government in exile, committed suicide in London to protest the lack of action on behalf of the Jews by the Allied governments. In his farewell note, he wrote:

Besides claiming an estimated 56,065 Jews accounted for (although his own figures showed the number to be 57,065) and noting that &quot;The number of destroyed dug-outs amounts to 631,&quot; in his official report dated 24 May 1943, Stroop listed the following as captured booty:

Sporadic resistance continued and the last skirmish took place on 5 June 1943 between Germans and a holdout group of armed Jews without connections to the resistance organizations.
== Casualties ==


13,000 Jews were killed in the ghetto during the uprising (some 6,000 among them were burnt alive or died from smoke inhalation). Of the remaining 50,000 residents, almost all were captured and shipped to the death camps of Majdanek and Treblinka.

Jürgen Stroop&#x27;s internal SS daily report for Friedrich Krüger, written on 16 May 1943, stated:

According to the casualty lists in Stroop&#x27;s report, German forces suffered a total of 110 casualties – 17 dead (of whom 16 were killed in action) and 93 injured – of whom 101 are listed by name, including over 60 members of the Waffen-SS. These figures did not include Jewish collaborators but did include the &quot;Trawniki men&quot; and Polish police under his command. 

Other sources have questioned the number of German casualties. Edelman claims that the German casualties amounted to 300 killed and wounded. The official German casualty figures were kept low, while the propaganda bulletins of the Polish Underground State, claimed that hundreds of occupiers had been killed in the fighting. But according to Israel Gutman, &quot;the number cited by Stroop (16 dead, 85 wounded) cannot be rejected out of hand, but it is likely that his list was neither complete, free of errors, nor indicative of the German losses throughout the entire period of resistance, until the absolute liquidation of Jewish life in the ghetto. All the same, the German casualty figures cited by the various Jewish sources are probably highly exaggerated.&quot; Other historians such as Raul Hilberg also confirm the accuracy of official German casualty figures. 

The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II.

== Aftermath ==

After the uprising was over, most of the incinerated houses were razed, and the Warsaw concentration camp complex was established in their place. Thousands of people died in the camp or were executed in the ruins of the ghetto. The SS hunted Jews hiding in the ruins. On 19 April 1943, the first day of the most significant period of the resistance, 7,000 Jews were transported from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka extermination camp. Many purportedly developed resistance groups and helped to plan and execute the revolt and mass escape of 2 August 1943. From May 1943 to August 1944, executions in the ruins of the ghetto were carried out by:

* Officers of the Warsaw SD facility and the security police, under the supervision of Dr. Ludwig Hahn, whose seat was located in Szuch Avenue;
* Pawiak staff members;
* KL Warschau staff members;
* SS-men from the Third Battalion of the 23rd SS Regiment and the Police (Battalion III/SS-Polizei Regiment 23), commanded by Major Otton Bundtke.

Open and secret executions carried out in Warsaw were led by SS-Obersturmführer Norbert Bergh-Trips, SS-Haupturmführer Paul Werner and SS-Obersturmführer Walter Witossek. The latter often presided over the police &quot;trio&quot;, signing mass death sentences for Polish political prisoners, which were later pronounced by the ad hoc court of the security police.

In October 1943, Bürkl was tried and condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Polish Resistance&#x27;s Underground court, and shot dead by the AK in Warsaw, a part of Operation Heads that targeted notorious SS officers. That same month, von Sammern-Frankenegg was killed by Yugoslav Partisans in an ambush in Croatia. Himmler, Globocnik and Krüger all committed suicide at the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.

The General Government Governor of Warsaw at the time of the Uprising, Dr. Ludwig Fischer, was tried and executed in 1947. Stroop was captured by Americans in Germany, convicted of war crimes in two trials (U.S. military and Polish), and executed by hanging in Poland in 1952, along with Warsaw Ghetto SS administrator Franz Konrad. Stroop&#x27;s aide, Erich Steidtmann, was exonerated for &quot;minimal involvement&quot;; he died in 2010 while under investigation for war crimes. Sturmbannführer Hermann Höfle who helped carry out the July 1942 Grossaktion Warsaw committed suicide after being arrested in 1962. Walter Bellwidt, who commanded a Waffen-SS battalion among Stroop forces, died on 13 October 1965. Hahn went into hiding until 1975, when he was apprehended and sentenced to life for crimes against humanity; he served eight years and died in 1986. SS Oberführer Arpad Wigand who served with von Sammern-Frankenberg as SS and Police Leader in Warsaw from 4 August 1941 to 23 April 1943 was tried for war crimes in Hamburg Germany in 1981 and sentenced to 12.5 years in prison; died 26 July 1983. Walter Reder reportedly served in the SS Panzer Grenadier Training Battalion III; he served a jail sentence in Italy from 1951 to 1985 for war crimes committed in 1944 in Italy and died in 1991. Josef Blösche was tried for war crimes and executed in 1969. Heinrich Klaustermeyer was tried for war crimes in 1965 and sentenced to life in prison. In 1976, he was released from prison on the grounds of his advanced cancer and died 13 days later.
The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 took place over a year before the Warsaw uprising of 1944. The ghetto had been destroyed by the time of the general uprising in the city, which was part of the Operation Tempest, a nationwide insurrection plan. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Polish Home Army&#x27;s Battalion Zośka was able to rescue 380 Jewish prisoners (mostly foreign) held in the concentration camp &quot;Gęsiówka&quot; set up by the Germans in an area adjacent to the ruins of former ghetto. These prisoners had been brought from Auschwitz and forced to clear the remains of the ghetto. A few small groups of ghetto residents also managed to survive in the undetected &quot;bunkers&quot; and to eventually reach the &quot;Aryan side&quot;. Several hundred survivors from the first uprising took part in the later uprising (mostly in non-combat roles such as logistics and maintenance, due to their physical state and general shortage of arms), joining the ranks of the Polish Home Army and the Armia Ludowa. According to Samuel Krakowski from the Jewish Historical Institute, &quot;The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising had a real influence ... in encouraging the activity of the Polish underground.&quot;

A number of survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, known as the &quot;Ghetto Fighters&quot;, went on to create the kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta&#x27;ot (literally: &quot;Ghetto Fighters&#x27;&quot;), which is located north of Acre, Israel. The founding members of the kibbutz include Yitzhak Zuckerman (Icchak Cukierman), who represented the ŻOB on the &#x27;Aryan&#x27; side, and his wife Zivia Lubetkin, who commanded a fighting unit. In 1984, members of the kibbutz published &quot;Daphei Edut&quot; (&quot;Testimonies of Survival&quot;), four volumes of personal testimonies from 96 kibbutz members. The settlement features a museum and archives dedicated to remembering the Holocaust. Yad Mordechai, a kibbutz just north of the Gaza Strip, was named after Mordechaj Anielewicz. In 2008, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi led a group of Israeli officials to the site of the uprising and spoke about the event&#x27;s &quot;importance for IDF combat soldiers&quot;.

In 1968, the 25th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Zuckerman was asked what military lessons could be learned from the uprising. He replied:

On 7 December 1970, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt spontaneously knelt while visiting the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes memorial in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. At the time, the action surprised many and was the focus of controversy, but it has since been credited with helping improve relations between the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries. Many people from the United States and Israel came for the 1983 commemoration. The last surviving Jewish resistance fighter, Simcha Rotem, died in Jerusalem on 22 December 2018, at age 94.

== Opposing forces ==

=== Jewish ===

Two Jewish underground organisations fought in the Warsaw Uprising: the left wing ŻOB founded in July 1942 by Zionist Jewish youth groups within the Warsaw Ghetto; and the right wing ŻZW, or Jewish Military Union, a national organization founded in 1939 by former Polish military officers of Jewish background which had strong ties to the Polish Home Army and cells in almost every major town across Poland. However, both organisations were officially incorporated into the Polish Home Army and its command structure in exchange for weapons and training.

Marek Edelman, who was the only surviving uprising commander from the left-wing ŻOB, stated that the ŻOB had 220 fighters and each was armed with a handgun, grenades, and Molotov cocktails. His organization had three rifles in each area, as well as two land mines and one submachine gun. Due to its socialist leanings, the Soviets and Israel promoted the actions of ŻOB as the dominant or only party in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, a view often adopted by secondary sources in the West.

The right-wing faction ŻZW, which was founded by former Polish officers, was larger, more established and had closer ties with the Polish Home Army, making it better equipped. Zimmerman describes the arms supplies for the uprising as &quot;limited but real&quot;. Specifically, Jewish fighters of the ŻZW received from the Polish Home Army: 2 heavy machine guns, 4 light machine guns, 21 submachine guns, 30 rifles, 50 pistols, and over 400 grenades for the uprising. During the Uprising, ŻZW is reported to have had about 400 well-armed fighters grouped in 11 units, with 4 units including fighters from the Polish Home Army. Due to the ŻZW&#x27;s anti-socialist stand and close ties with the Polish Home Army (which was subsequently outlawed by the Soviets), the Soviets suppressed publication of books and articles on ŻZW after the war and downplayed its role in the uprising, in favor of the more socialist ŻOB. 

More weapons were supplied throughout the uprising, and some were captured from the Germans. Some weapons were handmade by the resistance; sometimes such weapons worked.

Shortly before the uprising, Polish-Jewish historian Emanuel Ringelblum (who managed to escape from the Warsaw Ghetto but was later discovered and executed in 1944) visited a ŻZW armoury hidden in the basement at 7 Muranowska Street. In his notes, which form part of Oneg Shabbat archives, he reported:
They were armed with revolvers stuck in their belts. Different kinds of weapons were hung in the large rooms: light machine guns, rifles, revolvers of different kinds, hand grenades, bags of ammunition, German uniforms, etc., all of which were utilized to the full in the April &quot;action&quot;. (...) While I was there, a purchase of arms was made from a former Polish Army officer, amounting to a quarter of a million zloty; a sum of 50,000 zlotys was paid on account. Two machine guns were bought at 40,000 złoty each, and a large amount of hand grenades and bombs.

Although the Home Army&#x27;s stocks were meager, and general provision of arms limited, the right-wing ŻZW received significant quantities of armaments, including some heavy and light machine guns, submachine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades.

=== Polish ===
Due to the nature of the conflict and that it took place within the confines of German-guarded Ghetto, the role of the Polish Home Army was primarily one of ancillary support; namely, the provision of arms, ammunition and training. However, according to Marian Fuks, the Ghetto uprising would not have been possible without assistance from the Polish Resistance. Before the uprising started, the most important aid from the Polish resistance to the Jewish resistance took part of weapon smuggling and delivery. Some of the earliest weapons delivered to the ghetto in mid-1942 came from the communist Gwardia Ludowa group, which in August 1942 provided Jewish resistance with 9 pistols and 5 hand grenades&#x27;. Antoni Chruściel, commander of the Home Army in Warsaw, ordered the entire armory of the Wola district transferred to the ghetto. In January 1943 the Home Army delivered a larger shipment: 50 pistols, 50 hand grenades&#x27; and several kilograms of explosives, and together with a number of smaller shipments transferred around that time a total of 70 pistols, 10 rifles, 2 hand machine guns, 1 light machine gun, as well as ammunition and over 150 kilograms of explosives. Acquisition of weapons was supported from both Jewish and Polish funds, including those of Żegota. The Home Army also provided intelligence on German movements, connected Jewish resistance to some black market channels, and provided planning assistance for plans to defend the ghetto and safeguard the refugees. Home Army also disseminated information and appeals to help the Jews in the ghetto, both in Poland and by way of radio transmissions to the Allies, which fell largely on deaf ears.

During the uprising, units from the Polish Home Army and the communist Gwardia Ludowa attacked German units near the ghetto walls and attempted to smuggle weapons, ammunition, supplies, and instructions into the ghetto. The command of the Home Army ordered its sabotage units, Kedyw, to carry a series of actions around the walls against the German units under the codename Ghetto Action. A failed attempt to breach the ghetto walls on 19 April has been described as &quot;one of the first large-scale battles carried out by the Home Army&#x27;s Warsaw division.&quot; Between 19 and 23 April 1943, the Polish resistance engaged the Germans at six different locations outside the ghetto walls, shooting at German sentries and positions and in one case attempting to blow up a gate. Overall, the Home Army conduced seven total operations in support of the uprising. Following two unsuccessful attempts to breach the wall, the other operations focused on harassing Germans and their auxiliaries, inflicting a number of casualies. A National Security Corps unit commanded by Henryk Iwański (&quot;Bystry&quot;) reportedly fought inside the ghetto along with ŻZW and subsequently both groups retreated together (including 34 Jewish fighters) to the Aryan side; however later research cast doubts on the veracity of Iwański&#x27;s claims. Several ŻOB commanders and fighters also later escaped through the tunnels with assistance from the Poles and joined the Polish Home Army).

The failure to break through German defenses limited supplies to the ghetto, which was otherwise cut off from the outside world by a German-ordered blockade. Records confirm that the leftist ŻOB received less weaponry and support from the Polish Home Army, unlike the ŻZW with whom the Home Army had close ties and ideological similarities. Some survivors criticized gentile Poles for not providing sufficient support; for example in her book &quot;On Both Sides of the Wall&quot;, Vladka Meed, who was a member of the ŻOB, devoted a chapter to the insufficient support from the Polish resistance. The Home Army faced a number of dilemmas which resulted in it providing only a limited assistance to the Jewish resistance; these include the fact that it had very limited supplies and was unable to arm its own troops; the view (shared by most of the Jewish resistance) that any wide-scale uprising in 1943 would be premature and futile; and the difficulty to coordinate with the internally divided Jewish resistance, coupled with the pro-Soviet attitude of the ŻOB.

=== German ===

Ultimately, the efforts of the Jewish resistance fighters proved insufficient against the German occupation system. According to Hanna Krall, the German task force dispatched to put down the revolt and complete the deportation action numbered 2,090 men armed with a number of minethrowers and other light and medium artillery pieces, several armored vehicles, and more than 200 machine and submachine guns. Its backbone consisted of 821 Waffen-SS paramilitary soldiers from five SS Panzergrenadier reserve and training battalions and one SS cavalry reserve and training battalion. The other forces were drawn from the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo) order police (battalions from the 22nd and 23rd regiments), Warsaw personnel of the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) intelligence service, one battalion each from two Wehrmacht (Heer) railroad combat engineers regiments, a Wehrmacht battery of anti-aircraft artillery, a detachment of multinational (commonly but inaccurately referred to by the Germans and Jews alike as &quot;Ukrainians&quot;) ex-Soviet POW &quot;Trawniki-Männer&quot; auxiliary camp guards trained by the SS-Totenkopfverbände at Trawniki concentration camp, and technical emergency corps.

Several Gestapo jailers from the nearby political prison Pawiak, led by Franz Bürkl, volunteered to join the &quot;hunt&quot; for the Jews. A force of 363 officers from the Polish Police of the General Government (so-called Blue Police) was ordered by the Germans to cordon the walls of the ghetto. Warsaw fire department personnel were also forced to help in the operation. Jewish policemen were used in the first phase of the ghetto&#x27;s liquidation and subsequently summarily executed by the Gestapo.

Stroop later remarked:
I had two battalions of Waffen-SS, one hundred army men, units of Order Police, and seventy-five to a hundred Security Police people. The Security Police had been active in the Warsaw Ghetto for some time, and during this program it was their function to accompany SS units in groups of six or eight, as guides and experts in ghetto matters.

By his own words, Stroop reported that after he took command on 19 April 1943, the forces at his disposal totaled 31 officers and 1,262 men:

Stroop&#x27;s report listed ultimate forces at his disposal as 36 officers and 2,054 men:
His casualty lists also include members of four other Waffen-SS training and reserve units (1st SS Panzer Grenadier; 2nd SS Panzer Grenadier; 4th SS Panzer Grenadier; 5th SS Panzer Grenadier Training Battalions). Polish police came from the Kommissariarts 1st, 7th and 8th.

== In popular culture ==
The uprising is the subject of numerous works, in multiple media, such as Aleksander Ford&#x27;s film &quot;Border Street&quot; (1948), John Hersey&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wall&quot; (1950), Leon Uris&#x27; novel &quot;Mila 18&quot; (1961), Jack P. Eisner&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Survivor&quot; (1980), Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s films &quot;A Generation&quot; (1955), &quot;Samson&quot; (1961), &quot;Holy Week&quot; (1995), and Jon Avnet&#x27;s film &quot;Uprising&quot; (2001).

The photograph of a boy surrendering outside a bunker, with Trawniki with submachine guns in the background, became one of the best-known photographs of World War II and the Holocaust: He is said to represent all 6 million Jewish Holocaust victims.

<doc id="867870" wikidata="Q4742540" url="?curid=867870" title="America's Funniest People">
<text>America&#x27;s Funniest People is an American reality show on ABC that debuted on May 13, 1990 as a 30 minute television special America&#x27;s Funniest... Part II, aired after the popular &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;. The green-lit series, then named &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; for the fall season, aired as a weekly half-hour prime time series from September 9, 1990, to June 5, 1994. It was hosted by Dave Coulier and Arleen Sorkin from 1990 to 1992. Tawny Kitaen replaced Sorkin in 1992. The announcer was Ernie Anderson. Dan Slider composed the theme song, which was performed by Peter Hix.

== Format ==
The format was similar to &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, with the main difference that while &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; spent the majority of its time with accidental follies captured on tape, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; focused on people intentionally trying to be funny, doing things such as telling jokes, doing impressions, singing, dancing, performing scripted material, attempting wacky stunts, pulling pranks, etc.

Like &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; featured a contest for funniest video, with the first prize winner receiving $10,000 and the 2nd and 3rd prize winners receiving $3,000 and $2,000 respectively. However, unlike &quot;Funniest Home Videos&quot;, which relied on studio audience voting to determine the winner, &quot;Funniest People&quot; selected its winners via telephone vote for its first five episodes, with the winners announced at the beginning of the next show; the show switched to having the studio audience select the winner afterwards, like its parent show. Also, unlike its parent show, there was no $100,000 grand prize finale.

=== Jackalope vignettes ===
Originally known as &quot;Tiny the Jackalope&quot;, or simply &quot;The Jackalope&quot;, Jackalope sketches involved a creature attacking people by playing mean tricks on them (usually as punishment for people who had been mean themselves). Typically, the main target was a muscular man who absolutely despises the creature. The character&#x27;s catchphrase was, &quot;Fast as fast can be, you&#x27;ll never catch me!&quot; Host Dave Coulier did the voices for all characters in the Jackalope skits, which were played at a faster pace than other clips. The Jackalope was later renamed &quot;Jack Ching Bada-Bing&quot; in a &quot;Name the Jackalope&quot; contest.

=== This Old Shack ===
A series of shorts that center around bumbling, clumsy carpenters, Joe-Bob and Randy-Bob, who use haywire methods to remodel houses. The shorts are a parody of the PBS Series This Old House.

=== Alien Shorts ===
The Alien Shorts feature claymation miniature aliens who attempt to take over planet earth, but are constantly defeated by humankind&#x27;s daily routines and habits.

=== Whiz on Wheels ===
A recurring bit scripted as advertisement for the fictional Whiz on Wheels company, who perform services improperly and too fast to be good, causing more damage than they fix. They claim to be faster and cheaper than competing companies.

=== Comedy Mini-Movies by Dennis M. Miller and Jason Cardwell ===
Dennis and Jason first produced an Indiana Jones spoof for &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; called &quot;Pasadena Jones and the Satire of Doom&quot;. They then moved over to &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; for its initial season and produced a dozen videos which aired every other week. Although there were several videos with original characters, there were also spoofs of Rambo, James Bond, and Dirty Harry.

In the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; spoof, Harry was downgraded to a video store detective. After chasing a suspect all over San Francisco, Harry finally cornered him in an alley. He reaches into his jacket, and slowly pulls out a VHS movie, asking the suspect &quot;What I have here is a VHS video cassette, the most popular format in the world, and the question is, punk... did you rewind it?&quot;

=== &quot;Dunk Your Parents&quot; ===
For the show&#x27;s 1993-1994 season, a new game show segment called &quot;Dunk Your Parents&quot; was added, hosted by Skip Trippendale (Coulier), in which a kid contestant could drop one of their parents into a pool of water, similar to a dunk tank. The kid chose the parent that they wanted to dunk. That parent then sat on a chair over the water. The parent was then asked a trivia question, usually involving a list — for example, &quot;Name the seven dwarfs in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;&quot;. If the parent answered the question correctly, the other parent had to take their place. If not, that parent remained in the chair. The climax of the segment was when the child pushed a button to release the seat out from underneath the parent, dropping them into the water below.

On some occasions, instead of a question, the parent would have to complete a &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;-esque stunt (but these were often nearly impossible to complete).

=== &quot;Prank Patrol&quot; ===
When the show changed format and became &quot;The New America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; for the 1993-94 season, a new segment was added called the Prank Patrol. 5 kids would run around various parks and locations near Los Angeles, performing pranks on unsuspecting visitors. The Prank Patrol consisted of Brady Bluhm, Elena Epps, Raushan Hammond, Lindsay Ridgeway, and Lance Robinson. Pranks consisted of exploding ice cream cones, a man in a gorilla suit, a squirting drinking fountain, a remote control bat, an exploding trash can, and a hand in a jar of candy. Sean Daly was also in this episode

=== &quot;Weird Sports&quot; ===
A recurring segment centering on bizarre sporting events such as Rocky Mountain Rock Fishing, Pizza Diving, Meatball Miniature Golf, Brazilian Bicep Bowling, etc. Actor/comedian Dan Sachoff had hosted this segment in later seasons.

=== &quot;Cool Ways to Scare Your Mom&quot; ===
A recurring segment centering on the comedy duo Schwartz and Chung where Caleb Chung (inventor of the Furby) would teach viewers a simple sight gag and then show it to his mom, played by Gary Schwartz (known for voicing Demoman and Heavy in the video game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;). The segment was first introduced by &quot;Full House&quot; actress Jodie Sweetin. The reactions were mad, homemade special effects. The duo appeared 11 times in the run of the show.

== Production ==
The 30 minute pilot for the series was produced in May 1990. It was called (and the special and series originally promoted as) America&#x27;s Funniest... Part II, as it was shown immediately after &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;. The host of the show, Dave Coulier, like &quot;Funniest Home Videos&quot; host Bob Saget, was also one of the stars of the popular sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; which was airing at the same time as the series. The original series logo from the pilot episode was a slight revamp of the &quot;AFHV&quot; logo. When the pilot proved successful, the series went into full production in the fall as &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot;. In future airings, the pilot&#x27;s title card was retroactively changed to reflect the new permanent name and logo of the show, though a careful viewer would still notice &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest... Part II&quot; branding behind the studio audience.

&quot;Full House&quot;&#x27;s Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen made guest appearances, as they also did on &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;. The bulk of their visits to &quot;People&quot; took place once their collective popularity with kids and pre-teens took off. Their most notable appearance was in the fall of 1992, when they plugged their first single, &quot;Brother for Sale&quot;, from the release of &quot;Mary-Kate and Ashley: Our First Video&quot;.

It was produced by Vin Di Bona Productions, even though at the end of the show&#x27;s closing credits, it credited the company as Gina Communications, Inc. The show was originally taped at The Prospect Studios (then known as the ABC Television Center), on the same soundstage used for &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; at the time. The show traveled to Universal Studios Florida in 1992, taping five shows at the Animal Actors Stage.

In 1992, Sorkin was dismissed by Vin Di Bona. In response, Sorkin filed a lawsuit against Di Bona, claiming that she was dismissed from the show due to her race, after ABC Chairman Dan Burke had suggested to Di Bona that Sorkin be replaced by an African-American or a person of another ethnic minority. Sorkin sought $450,000 for lost earnings, and an additional unspecified amount for harm to her professional reputation and emotional injury. Sorkin additionally claimed that after she denounced the move as unfair, Di Bona changed plans and hired new cohost Tawny Kitaen, who was white. Randy Davison was invited to be on multiple episodes, doing impersonations of Edith Bunker and Popeye as Elvis.

During the 1992-1993 season, the entire production moved to Universal Studios Florida. The start of the 1993-94 season modified the show&#x27;s title to &quot;The New America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot;, with an updated logo, and production moving back to Los Angeles, originating from Hollywood Center Studios. This reflected the addition of new themed segments, some special guests, and the new practice of having a guest co-host (usually a star from another ABC series) join Coulier and Kitaen each week. However, these changes were not enough to improve the show&#x27;s failing ratings, and it was cancelled at the end of that season. The network continued to air repeats until late-August.

During the latter half of the show&#x27;s run, and for at most a year after it was canceled, short 30-second segments from &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; ran in commercial breaks during ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup. These would usually consist of excerpts from longer segments, usually featuring young kids telling jokes or engaging in stunts.

The show&#x27;s premise would later integrate to &quot;AFV&quot;.

== Syndication ==

Repeat episodes of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; aired on TBS from 1998 to 2003.

== Revival ==
In April 2024, it was announced that &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; (now abbreviated as AFP) would be revived and return to ABC. The revival will be hosted by Alfonso Ribeiro, current host of sister show &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; (AFV), and is slated to premiere in summer 2025.

<doc id="867876" wikidata="Q1374863" url="?curid=867876" title="Richard Norman Shaw">
<text>Richard Norman Shaw RA (7 May 1831 – 17 November 1912), also known as Norman Shaw, was a British architect who worked from the 1870s to the 1900s, known for his country houses and for commercial buildings. He is considered to be among the greatest of British architects; his influence on architectural style was strongest in the 1880s and 1890s.

==Early life and education==
Shaw was born 7 May 1831 in Edinburgh, the sixth and last child of William Shaw (1780–1833), an Irish Protestant and army officer, and Elizabeth née Brown (1785–1883), from a family of successful Edinburgh lawyers. William Shaw died 2 years after his son&#x27;s birth, leaving debts. Two of Shaw&#x27;s siblings died young and a third in early adulthood. The family lived first in Annandale Street and then Haddington Place. Richard was educated at an academy for languages, located at 3 and 5 Hill Street Edinburgh until c.1842, then had one year of formal schooling in Newcastle, followed by being taught by his sister Janet. The eldest surviving child Robert had moved to London to work; the rest of the family followed about 1846, living in Middleton Road, Dalston. Richard began his apprenticeship almost immediately at an unknown architect&#x27;s practice. 

By 1849, he had transferred to the London office of sixty-year-old William Burn, at whose practice Shaw remained for five years. He attended the evening lectures on architecture given at the Royal Academy of Arts by Charles Robert Cockerell. He met William Eden Nesfield at the Royal Academy, with whom he briefly partnered in some architectural designs. During 1854–1856, Shaw travelled with a Royal Academy scholarship, collecting sketches that were published as &quot;Architectural Sketches from the Continent&quot;, 1858. On his return to London he moved to George Edmund Street&#x27;s practice.

==Practice==

In 1863, after sixteen years of training, Shaw opened a practice for a short time with Nesfield. In 1872, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy.

Shaw worked for, among others, the artists John Callcott Horsley and George Henry Boughton, and the industrialist Lord Armstrong. He designed large houses such as Cragside, Grim&#x27;s Dyke, and Chigwell Hall, as well as a series of commercial buildings using a wide range of styles.

Shaw was elected to the Royal Academy in 1877, and co-edited (with Sir Thomas Jackson RA) the 1892 collection of essays, &quot;Architecture, a profession or an Art?&quot;. He firmly believed it was an art. In later years, Shaw moved to a heavier classical style which influenced the emerging Edwardian Classicism of the early 20th century. Shaw died in London, where he had designed residential buildings in areas such as Pont Street, and public buildings such as New Scotland Yard.

Shaw&#x27;s early country houses avoided Neo-Gothic and the academic styles, reviving vernacular materials like half timber and hanging tiles, with projecting gables and tall massive chimneys with &quot;inglenooks&quot; for warm seating. Shaw&#x27;s houses soon attracted the misnomer the &quot;Queen Anne style&quot;. As his skills developed, he dropped some of the mannered detailing, his buildings gained in dignity, and acquired an air of serenity and a quiet homely charm which were less conspicuous in his earlier works; half timber construction was more sparingly used, and finally disappeared entirely.

==Family and later life==
On 16 July 1867, Shaw married Agnes Haswell Wood at the parish church in Hampstead. She was the daughter of James Wood and was born in New South Wales, and most of the Wood siblings were sent to England for part of their education. All the children but Agnes returned to New South Wales and from there, most of the family moved to Christchurch in New Zealand. Agnes lived with an aunt in England and in 1866, she became engaged to Shaw. Her nephew, Cecil Wood (1878–1947), was gifted at drawing and Shaw&#x27;s career is assumed to have been an influence in Cecil Wood becoming an architect.

In later life he lived at 6 Ellerdale Road, Hampstead, London. He died in London and is buried in St John-at-Hampstead Churchyard, Hampstead, London.

==Bedford Park, London==
One of Shaw&#x27;s major commissions was the planning and designing of buildings for Bedford Park, London. Shaw was commissioned in 1877 by Jonathan T. Carr though his involvement only lasted until 1879. He designed St Michael and All Angels, Bedford Park, as the Anglican parish church for the development.

<text>In financial markets, a share (sometimes referred to as [[stock]] or [[Equity (finance)|equity]]) is a unit of equity ownership in the capital stock of a corporation. It can refer to units of mutual funds, limited partnerships, and real estate investment trusts. Share capital refers to all of the shares of an enterprise. The owner of shares in a company is a shareholder (or stockholder) of the corporation. A share expresses the ownership relationship between the company and the shareholder. The denominated value of a share is its face value, and the total of the face value of issued shares represent the capital of a company, which may not reflect the market value of those shares.

The income received from the ownership of shares is a dividend. There are different types of shares such as equity shares, preference shares, deferred shares, redeemable shares, bonus shares, right shares, and employee stock option plan shares.

==Terminology==

* Stock 
* Equity 
* Shares outstanding are shares that are authorized by the government, issued by the company, and held by third parties.
* Treasury shares are shares that are authorized, issued, and held by the company itself.
* Issued shares are the sum of shares outstanding and treasury shares.
* Shares authorized include both issued (by the board of directors or shareholders) and unissued but authorized by the company&#x27;s constitutional documents.

==Valuation==

Shares are valued according to the various principles in different markets, but a basic premise is that a share is worth the price at which a transaction would be likely to occur were the shares to be sold. The liquidity of markets is a major consideration as to whether a share is able to be sold at any given time. An actual sale transaction of shares between buyer and seller is usually considered to provide the best prima facie market indicator as to the &quot;true value&quot; of shares at that particular time. A minority discount is usually applied when valuing a minority shareholding (less than 50%), where ownership of the shares offers limited control over the business if this is held by a majority shareholder.

==Tax treatment==
Tax treatment of dividends varies between tax jurisdictions. For instance, in India, dividends are tax free in the hands of the shareholder up to INR 1 million, but the company paying the dividend has to pay dividend distribution tax at 12.5%. There 
is also the concept of a deemed dividend, which is not tax free. Further, Indian tax laws include provisions to stop dividend stripping.

==Share certificates==
Historically, investors were given share certificates as evidence of their ownership of shares. In modern times, certificates are not always given and ownership may be recorded electronically by a system such as CREST or DTCC, a central securities depository.

==Tracing shares==

As of May 2022, the United States Supreme Court was considering the case of &quot;Slack Technologies, LLC v. Pirani&quot;, No. 22-200, 598 U.S. ___ (2023), with regard to whether Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 require plaintiffs to plead and prove that they acquired shares of stock registered under and traceable to the registration statement they claim was misleading.

<text>Latin Rock is a term to describe a subgenre blending traditional sounds and elements of Latin American and Hispanic Caribbean Folk with Rock Music. However, it is widely used in the English-language media to refer any kind of rock music featuring Spanish or Portuguese vocals. This has led to controversy about the scope of the terminology.

Latin Rock should not be confused with &quot;rock music from Latin America&quot; or Rock en Español. It&#x27;s also closely related to the Latin alternative scene (which combines Latin elements with Alternative Rock, Pop, electronic music, indie or hip hop among others) a term often used to refer the same phenomenon.

== History ==

=== Origins (1950s–1960s) ===
 Rock and roll music of the 1950s originated from a variety of sources including rhythm and blues, blues, gospel, country, bluegrass, western swing, and Tin Pan Alley pop music. Also, there was some influence of the traditional Latin music. Caribbean rhythms like calypso were used in surf music; and there were some rock and roll songs based on cha-cha-chá or mambo.

Latin rock was born in the United States during the late 1950s, though the term was not yet created. In 1958 an adaptation of a Mexican folk song called &quot;La Bamba&quot; was recorded by the Chicano rock artist Ritchie Valens. That same year, instrumental rock band the Champs released &quot;Tequila&quot;, a song that incorporates clear Latin sounds and was composed by the band&#x27;s chicano saxophonist Danny Flores).

During the 1960s, there were more examples of rock artists like Thee Midniters, Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians, Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs or Sir Douglas Quintet that included Latin rhythms on their compositions. Also Chicano rock became popular in California; although not all of these can be considered early Latin rock artists since many of them lacked the Latin folk influences.

In some Latin American countries, Latin rock started to develop as well. In Peru, Colombia, Argentina, but specially Brazil where Tropicália appeared in the mid-1960s with the first releases of Os Mutantes, Gal Costa and Caetano Veloso from 1967 to 1970, a music movement that merged rock music with bossa nova, psychedelia and other Latin elements, and this can be regarded as the main root of the genre.

=== &quot;Latin rock&quot; term born (1970s) ===

 In 1969, after the release of the debut album by Santana, the term &quot;Latin rock&quot; appeared in the US and other parts of the world. It was an attempt to describe the band&#x27;s music style as a fusion of Latin American and Caribbean rhythms, soul, jazz, funk, blues, psychedelia and rhythm and blues based on rock music.

Following Santana, other American bands appeared like Malo, Ocho, Mandrill, El Chicano, Eddie Palmieri&#x27;s Harlem River Drive, War, Sapo and Azteca in the early 1970s popularizing the genre in the USA and the rest of the world.

The Latin American counterpart of Latin rock bands could be seen in Peru with bands like Telegraph Avenue, Traffic Sound, the Mad&#x27;s, El Polen and specially Black Sugar melting rock with jazz music, Peruvian folk, progressive rock and Latin elements; in Colombia highlighted Siglo Cero, Génesis and La Columna de Fuego; in Argentina Arco Iris; and in Chile, Los Jaivas; in Brazil, artist such as Jorge Ben developed samba rock.

In the Philippines band, Maria Cafra fused elements of blues, rock, Latin and kundiman to mold their distinct sound.

The genre arrived in Europe with the Spaniards Barrabás, Dutch Massada and African-British Osibisa.

Meanwhile, reggae music achieved a great success around the world. This rhythm originated in Jamaica during the 1960s, evolving from ska, rocksteady and bluebeat. Since its origins along with rock music and rhythm and blues with Jamaican folk rhythms, the Caribbean and Continental Latin America elements influenced the scene. Nevertheless, Reggae or Ska are not considered as part of the Latin Rock. On the other hand, disco also influenced Latin rock during the 1970s.

=== Latin rock evolution (1980–present)===
 After the birth of punk in late 1970s, the genre also was influenced by many other music styles. Some British punk and new wave acts like the Clash included elements that could be considered as &quot;latin&quot; in &quot;Sandinista!&quot; (1980). Other bands such as Bow Wow Wow, Haircut One Hundred, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Modern Romance, Special AKA and Blue Rondo a la Turk did as well.

 In Spain, Los Coyotes, Los Mestizos and Radio Futura, that had emerged as new wave and post-punk acts, finally got influenced by Latin music at mid 1980s. Spain would go on to produce some Latin acts like Macaco, Amparanoia and Jarabe de Palo.

In France, bands like Les Negresses Vertes played a fusion of rock with World music including Latin elements. But Manu Chao was the major success of Latin rock in France with the band Mano Negra (also as a solo artist) with a style that would be known later as Latin alternative. A mix of rock, with Latin elements, Arabic music, punk, rap, flamenco, ska and reggae.

In the US during this period musicians like Los Lobos, El Vez, Sheila E., David Hidalgo, David Byrne (ex-leader of Talking Heads), and Cesar Rosas fused Latin music and rock music. David Byrne was interested in Brazilian music.

The genre consolidated during the 1990s in Latin America. Many bands appeared such as Rio Roma (Mexico), Maná (Mexico), Caifanes (Mexico), Café Tacuba (Mexico), Aterciopelados (Colombia), Paralamas do Sucesso (Brazil), Bersuit Vergarabat (Argentina), Karamelo Santo (Argentina), Maldita Vecindad (Mexico), Carmina Burana (Argentina), Los Fabulosos Cadillacs (Argentina), Soda Stereo (Argentina), Los Prisioneros (Chile), Los Tres (Chile), Octavia (Bolivia), Karnak (Brazil), Chancho en Piedra (Chile), Julieta Venegas (Mexico), Arena Hash (Peru) and Los Rabanes (Panama), that incorporated Latin folk rhythms on their compositions (especially Caifanes and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs). Ecuadorian rock incorporated recently indigenous musical influences.

== Controversy about the term ==

 During the late 1990s, the rising population of &quot;Latinos&quot; in the US (term popularized since the 1960s due to the incorrect and confusing use of the term &quot;Spanish&quot; and the unpopular term &quot;Hispanic&quot;) led the music industry to create the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences as a sub-department of National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Also, in 2000 the Latin Grammy Awards were created. Thus, a great part of the English media started to refer to any kind of music featuring vocals in Spanish as &quot;Latin music&quot;.

This term achieved a great success in some Latin American countries, where some of their regional press started to use the new terminology. This phenomenon spread the use of the &quot;Latin rock&quot; term with a quite different meaning from the original one. This led to controversy and confusion among many in the population.

<text>Agnico Eagle Mines Limited is a Canadian-based gold producer with operations in Canada, Finland, Australia and Mexico and exploration and development activities extending to the United States. Agnico Eagle has full exposure to higher gold prices consistent with its policy of no-forward gold sales. It has paid a cash dividend every year since 1983.

==History==
In 1953, five struggling mining companies joined together to become Cobalt Consolidated Mining, which would last until 1957, when the company changed its name to Agnico Mines. &quot;Agnico&quot; is derived from the periodic table of elements using the symbols for silver (Ag), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co).
In 1963, Paul Penna became the president of Agnico Mines, and he eventually oversaw the merger of Agnico Mines with Eagle Mines Ltd, a successful gold exploration company, enabling the development of Eagle&#x27;s Joutel mining complex in northern Quebec. The newly formed company became Agnico Eagle Mines Limited.

In 1974, the Joutel mine went into production and would eventually produce approximately 1.1 million ounces of gold until its closure in 1993. During this period, Agnico Eagle also acquired the property and assets of Dumagami Mines Limited in north-western Quebec, which had recently gone into production a year earlier in 1988. The Dumagami mine would eventually be renamed the LaRonde mine, which is now considered the flagship mining operation for Agnico Eagle, and one of the largest gold deposits in Canada. With LaRonde producing steadily, Agnico Eagle acquired more assets over the following years.

In 1993, they completed the purchase of the Goldex mine, becoming the 100% owner of the largest unexploited gold deposit in Quebec. This was followed by the purchase of the Lapa gold deposit in 2000, Riddarhyttan Resources AB (the 100% owner of the Suurikuusikko gold deposit in northern Finland, which would become the Kittilä mine) in 2005, the Pinos Altos project in Mexico in 2006, and the purchase of Cumberland Resources in 2007, giving Agnico Eagle 100% control of the Meadowbank gold project in Nunavut, Canada.

As a result of these purchases, the following years would see Agnico Eagle grow from a single-operation gold producer (LaRonde) to a much larger company consisting of 6 mines in total, with Goldex going into production in 2008, Kittila, Lapa and Pinos Altos in 2009, and Meadowbank in 2010.

In 2010, Agnico Eagle completed the purchase of the Meliadine property, located southeast of Meadowbank near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut. In 2011, the company also announced a $70 million (CAD) investment in Rubicon Minerals, representing a 9.2% ownership stake and access to the Phoenix gold project located in the heart of Red Lake, Ontario.

In 2016, Agnico Eagle was ranked as the 14th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights in Arctic resource extraction.

In 2018, CEO Sean Boyd received &quot;The Northern Miner&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Mining Person of the Year Award&quot; at the annual Pacific Mine Forum (PMF).

In the 2021 Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI) Agnico Eagle Mines Limited was ranked no. 35 among 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle.

In 2021, a $13.5 billion merger between Kirkland Lake Gold and Agnico consolidated the largest gold mines in Canada&#x27;s Abitibi gold belt.

Company veteran Ammar Al-Joundi was appointed CEO of Agnico on 1 March 2022, after Tony Makuch, the holdover CEO from its merger with KL Gold, lasted only three weeks in the job and was fired by Sean Boyd who had progressed by then to the Chair the amalamgated company, which at the time had a market capitalization of $29 billion.

==Operations==

=== LaRonde gold mine ===
The LaRonde mine, formerly Dumagami Mine, is located alongside the Trans-Canada highway in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region between Cadillac and Val-d&#x27;or, Quebec.

LaRonde&#x27;s Penna shaft, also known as shaft 3, is believed to be the deepest single lift shaft in the Western Hemisphere, descending more than three kilometres (or 9800 ft) below the surface. It is estimated to have the longest potential lifespan of Agnico Eagle&#x27;s six operating mines, estimated to be approximately 35 years once completed, from 1988 to 2023. The lifespan is now expected to run until 2032. The operation currently mines gold, zinc, copper and silver ores and employs 1,042 workers.

The mine was renamed to the LaRonde Mine by company founder Paul Penna, to honour its first project manager, mining engineer Donald J. &quot;Don&quot; LaRonde (c. 1931-1986).

=== Goldex ===
Employing 213 people, with an estimated mine life of 10 years (2008-2018); Goldex is an underground mine located just outside Val-d&#x27;Or, Quebec, Canada. Goldex is unique due to its partnership with the Quebec government in the restoration of the nearby abandoned Manitou mine tailings site. Through an innovative approach, the tailings from the Goldex mine are sent through a 25 km long pipeline to the Manitou site where they neutralize the acidic waters in the area, the result of years of poorly confined tailings generated between 1942 and 1979 by the mining companies operating the Manitou project at the time. Not only do the Goldex tailings neutralize and help rehabilitate the site, but the system also eliminates the need for a tailings pond at the Goldex site itself.

The mine is expected to run until 2032 and currently produces roughly 134,000 oz of gold per year.

=== Lapa ===
Lapa, located about 11 km away from the LaRonde mine (see above), in the Rivière-Héva municipality of the Abitibi region in Quebec, Canada, is one of Agnico Eagle&#x27;s smaller operations employing 192 people, with a 6-year mine life expectancy (2009-2015). The main headframe that is used at the Lapa mine was constructed almost entirely from a pre-existing headframe at LaRonde. The original headframe was dismantled, sand blasted and painted before it was installed at Lapa. Although Lapa may be a smaller operation in comparison to our other mines, it is one of Agnico Eagle&#x27;s highest-grade mines, with reserve grades twice as rich as the company average.

=== Kittilä ===
In the Lapland region of Northern Finland, Agnico Eagle&#x27;s Kittilä operation has a life expectancy of 23 years (2009–2032). With 375 employees, this open pit and underground mine is one of the largest known gold deposits in all of Europe, containing almost 4.9 million ounces of gold in reserves. Aggressive exploration is also currently underway; with the Kittilä mine serving notice that gold-mining is again a booming industry in northern Finland.

=== Pinos Altos ===
Agnico Eagle&#x27;s largest employer, with 972 employees, is the Pinos Altos mine located in the state of Chihuahua, in northern Mexico. Pinos Altos began operation in 2009 and is expected to continue until 2026, resulting in an estimated 17 years of production. The open-pit and underground mining operation is in the mountainous Sierra Madre gold and silver belt of northern Mexico.

=== La India ===
La India is an open pit mine is located approximately 200 km east of Hermosillo in Sonora, Mexico. It began production in February 2014 and has a mine life expectancy of 6 years.

=== Meadowbank ===

Meadowbank is an open-pit mine in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut with an 8-year life expectancy (2010 – 2017). Meadowbank is one of Agnico Eagle&#x27;s most recent mine to begin operation, and has about 650 employees. In 2010 the first gold brick was poured at Meadowbank, which was also the first ever gold brick to be poured in the history of Nunavut. Meadowbank is also Agnico Eagle&#x27;s largest producer, estimated to produce 430,000 ounces of gold in 2014.

==Exploration==
The 2011 exploration program is expected to include more than 410 km of planned drilling to expand resources and convert our large gold resource to reserves. 
Major programs are planned at the following locations:

Meliadine – 90,000 meters of diamond drilling, an underground bulk sample, new permanent accommodations at the exploration camp, permitting infrastructure upgrades.

Kittilä – 56,200 meters of exploration and conversion drilling, and construction of an exploration ramp to accelerate the definition of resources and facilitate additional exploration at depth.

Goldex – 58,200 meters of diamond drilling will principally target resource expansion for the D zone. Pending the results of a planned mining study in 2011, a reserve conversion program will also be considered.

LaRonde/Bousquet/Ellison – 42,050 meters of drilling, which includes a follow-up exploration program for Ellison.

Pinos Altos – 33,800 meters of drilling including minesite (reserve conversion) and regional (resource expansion) drilling, and an underground exploration program and scoping study for the Cubiro zone.

Meadowbank – 32,000 meters of conversion and exploration drilling targeting extensions of the Vault deposit and underground potential beneath Goose South.

Gilt Edge – In 2018, a former gold mine in South Dakota was acquired in an exploration-environmental partnership with the EPA.

In December 2016 Agnico invested CA$4.5 million into Canadian junior mining company Cartier Resources to conduct exploration on the Chimo, Benoist, Wilson, Fenton and Cadillac Extension projects in Quebec.

==Carbon footprint==
Agnico-Eagle Mines Group reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for 31 December 2020 at 578 Kt (+57/+11% y-o-y). The growth accelerated compared to the long-term upward trend (CAGR of +7.6% since 4Q&#x27;16).

<text>Julie Ellen &quot;Tawny&quot; Kitaen ( ; August 5, 1961 – May 7, 2021) was an American actress. She began her career as a television actress, appearing in the television films &quot;Malibu&quot; (1983) and &quot;California Girls&quot; (1985). She also starred in the comedies &quot;The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak&quot; and &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; (both 1984), and the horror film &quot;Witchboard&quot; (1986).

Kitaen garnered widespread recognition for her appearances in a number of music videos, including Ratt&#x27;s &quot;Back for More&quot; (1984) and Whitesnake&#x27;s &quot;Still of the Night&quot;, &quot;Is This Love&quot; and &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; (all 1987).

In the 2000s, Kitaen transitioned into appearing on reality television series, including &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; (2006) and &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot; (2008), the latter of which documented Kitaen&#x27;s issues with substance abuse.

==Early life==
Julie Ellen Kitaen was born in San Diego, California on August 5, 1961. She was the eldest of three children born to Linda Kitaen (née Taylor), a housewife and one-time beauty pageant participant, and Terry Kitaen, an employee of a neon sign company. Kitaen&#x27;s mother was of Scottish and Irish descent, while her father was of Russian-Jewish heritage.

Kitaen was raised in the Jewish faith. She began using the nickname &quot;Tawny&quot; at the age of 12 on her own initiative. As a child, she struggled with dyslexia, which led to her to drop out of Mission Bay High School. At the age of 14, with backstage passes after a Peter Frampton concert at Balboa Stadium, she witnessed the VIP treatment afforded Frampton&#x27;s girlfriend Penny and aspired to achieve it for herself.

==Career==
Kitaen modeled and appeared in television commercials for Jack LaLanne&#x27;s European Health Spas in the early 1980s. In a January 2021 Instagram post a few months before her death, she claimed the experience inspired her to become an actress.

Kitaen appeared on the cover of Ratt&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Ratt&quot; (1983) and the band&#x27;s debut Atlantic studio album &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot; (1984). She was dating the band&#x27;s guitarist Robbin Crosby at the time.

Kitaen began her acting career in 1983 with a minor role in the television movie &quot;Malibu.&quot; In 1984, she starred as the title character of the erotic adventure movie &quot;The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak,&quot; also called &quot;Gwendoline.&quot; Her other film appearances include &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; (1984) as the bride-to-be of Tom Hanks&#x27; character, and starring roles in the minor box office hit &quot;Witchboard&quot; (1986), &quot;White Hot&quot;, and &quot;Dead Tides.&quot;

She appeared in several music videos in the 1980s for the band Whitesnake, including the hits &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, &quot;Still of the Night&quot;, &quot;Is This Love&quot;, and &quot;The Deeper the Love&quot;. She also appeared in Ratt&#x27;s &quot;Back for More&quot; music video.

From February to July 1989, she appeared as Lisa DiNapoli on the daytime serial &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. She appeared on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as Jerry&#x27;s girlfriend in the 1991 episode &quot;The Nose Job.&quot; She appeared in 19 episodes of the TV series &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; from 1991 to 1993 as nighttime DJ Mona Loveland, who has a show called &quot;Mona Til Midnight.&quot; She also had recurring parts in &quot;&quot; and co-hosted &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; from 1992 to 1994.

Kitaen joined the cast of the sixth edition of the VH1 reality television show &quot;The Surreal Life,&quot; which began airing in March 2006. She also appeared in the second season of the VH1 reality TV show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew,&quot; which began in October 2008. She appeared in the Season 4 Episode 12 of &quot;Botched&quot;, requesting that her breast implants be removed.

==Personal life and death==
Kitaen dated Ratt guitarist Robbin Crosby during and after high school. They moved in together as teenagers when Crosby was in the band Phenomenon.

She married Whitesnake singer David Coverdale in 1989; they divorced in 1991.

Kitaen had a year-long affair with football player, actor and media personality O. J. Simpson while he was married to Nicole Brown Simpson. The affair was revealed at Simpson&#x27;s 1997 civil trial for wrongful death.

Kitaen was married to baseball player Chuck Finley from 1997 to 2002, with whom she had two daughters, Wynter and Raine. In 2002 she was charged with domestic violence for an incident involving Finley; in a plea bargain, she agreed to enter a spousal battery counseling program and avoid contact with Finley. Three days later, Finley filed for divorce.

In November 2006, prosecutors charged Kitaen with possessing 15 grams of cocaine in her San Juan Capistrano home in Orange County. The authorities said her two children were home at the time and that she had granted deputies permission for the search. In December 2006, Kitaen entered a six-month rehabilitation program in exchange for the dismissal of a felony drug-possession charge.

On September 26, 2009, Kitaen was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in Newport Beach, California. The following July, she pleaded no contest to misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to two days in jail, ordered to attend a first-offender alcohol program and required to perform 64 hours of community service.

On July 22, 2019, Kitaen was again arrested for DUI in Newport Beach. She was formally charged with a misdemeanor related to the arrest on October 22 of that year. Kitaen pleaded not guilty and was scheduled for a pretrial hearing on May 18, 2021. However, she died before the hearing could take place. If convicted, Kitaen could have been incarcerated.

=== Death ===
Kitaen died at her Newport Beach home on May 7, 2021, at the age of 59, from heart issues and drug ingestion. She had been working with author and historian Colin Heaton on her memoirs for the past year. Kitaen&#x27;s death was confirmed to &quot;The New York Times&quot; by her daughter Wynter Finley, who told the paper that the cause of death was not immediately known. Police reported that nothing at the scene indicated alcohol or drugs as a factor in the death. The Orange County coroner&#x27;s office declared it a &quot;residential death&quot;, without further details.

In October 2021, the Orange County coroner&#x27;s office announced Kitaen&#x27;s official cause of death was dilated cardiomyopathy, a common type of heart disease. Other contributing factors to her death included mild coronary atherosclerosis and drug ingestion, including mirtazapine, alprazolam, acetaminophen, pregabalin, and hydrocodone.

<text>Many colleges and universities publish satirical journals, conventionally referred to as &quot;humor magazines.&quot;

Among the most famous: The Harvard &quot;Lampoon&quot;, which gave rise to the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; in 1970, &quot;The Yale Record&quot;, the nation&#x27;s oldest college humor magazine (founded in 1872), the Princeton &quot;Tiger Magazine&quot; which was founded in 1882, Pennsylvania &quot;Punch Bowl&quot;, founded in 1899, the &quot;Stanford Chaparral&quot; founded in 1899, and &quot;Jester of Columbia&quot;, founded 1901.

In 2022, leadership of several college humor magazines pooled together to form the College Satire Guild, a nonprofit with the stated purpose of &quot;fostering creative expression...through satirical journalism.&quot; Currently, the membership includes thirteen colleges.

<text>Baron Zemo () is the name of two supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. [[Heinrich Zemo]] and his son [[Helmut Zemo]] have both been depicted as a major adversary of Captain America and the Avengers, as well as the leader of the Masters of Evil, a team comprising numerous villains in the Marvel Universe.

In the 2021 radio drama podcast series &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Wastelanders&quot;, two original incarnations of King Zemo (voiced by James Saito) are introduced as Helmut Zemo&#x27;s successors as Dictators of the Wastelands: Herman Zemo (voiced by Ki Hong Lee) and [[Spider-Bitch (Ashley Barton)|Ash Morse]] (voiced by Sasha Lane).

==Publication history==
The initial published version of Baron Zemo was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and was first seen in a flashback in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #4 (March 1964). The character did not actually appear in person and was not identified as Heinrich Zemo until &quot;The Avengers&quot; #6 (July 1964) and &quot;Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos&quot; #8 in the same month. Zemo was retroactively added into the history of Captain America upon the hero&#x27;s reintroduction to the Silver Age two issues prior. The character subsequently appears in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #7 (Aug. 1964), #9-10 (October–November 1964), &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #60 (December 1964), and &quot;The Avengers&quot; #15 (April 1965), in which he is killed.

Since then, Helmut Zemo has used the Baron Zemo title since &quot;Captain America&quot; #275.

Harbin Zemo, the progenitor of the Zemo line was first seen, via flashback, in the &quot;Avengers/Thunderbolts&quot; limited series. The backstory of the 11 barons before Heinrich and Helmut was later touched upon in the limited series &quot;Thunderbolts Presents: Zemo – Born Better&quot;. So far it seems that every baron is succeeded by his son. According to Wendell Volker&#x27;s notes, Harbin had other children before Hademar who did not survive to adulthood; Herbert had two sons who died of illness prior to Helmuth.

==Fictional character biography==
===Barony of Zemo===
The Zemo barony started in Zeulniz, Germany in 1480 when Harbin Zemo, the granary charge man and ministerialis of the town borrowed a suit of armor and stood alone against an invading horde of Slav raiders. Harbin slew the entire horde and so impressed the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire that he was elevated to nobility and awarded Zeulniz. As time went on Harbin Zemo became irritated and tired of the demands of the barony. Harbin died of old age in 1503 and was succeeded by his son Hademar. Hademar was a weak man who had never seen battle, but who was all too eager to become the next baron. Shortly after Harbin&#x27;s death, Hademar was made baron. Hademar&#x27;s 12-year-old son Heller plotted to kill his father and soon became the next baron, thanks to the help of his time-travelling descendant Helmut Zemo. History looks upon Heller as the most progressive of all the 13 barons in the Zemo line.

Helmut&#x27;s next few trips in time involved him going into battle in 1556 alongside Heller&#x27;s son Herbert Zemo, who was a proud warrior, assassinating Herbert&#x27;s son Helmuth Zemo in 1640 and narrowly escaping death at the hands of Helmuth&#x27;s son, Hackett Zemo in 1710.

Helmut later arrived at Castle Zemo in the 1760s around the time that the seventh baron, Hartwig Zemo died in battle during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Helmut began to observe Hartwig&#x27;s son Hilliard as he romanced Elsbeth Kleinenshvitz, the daughter of a Jewish merchant whose family had worked for the Zemo family from the inception of the barony. After Hartwig died, Hilliard became the eighth baron and was forced to turn against Elsbeth and her family. Men loyal to the barony murdered Elsbeth&#x27;s family to keep them from becoming too powerful. A pregnant Elsbeth was saved by Helmut Zemo, who was still travelling in time. Hilliard would later go on to marry an Austrian girl named Gretchen.

Helmut is next seen in 1879 as a member of the travelling guard of the tenth Baron Zemo, Hobart. Helmut had worked for Hobart for several weeks and routinely had to defend Hobart from civilian assassination attempts. Unrest had broken out in the German Empire after William I, German Emperor passed legislation to curb socialism following attempts on William&#x27;s life. The commoners grew angry with the noblemen, including Hobart, despite the fact that Hobart fought for their rights. Helmut Zemo leaped to another time and was unable to save Hobart from being killed.

Helmut next arrived during World War I to meet his grandfather Baron Herman Zemo. Herman was defending Germany against a battalion of British soldiers led by the original Union Jack. Helmut witnessed his grandfather employ his own concoction of mustard gas against the British troops and watched as they died in agony (Union Jack had fled the battle by this time). Helmut went with Herman and his men back to Castle Zemo to find it devastated. Helmut leaped to his next time period to see his father&#x27;s role in Nazi Germany.

===Heinrich Zemo and Helmut Zemo===
The 12th Baron Zemo, Heinrich Zemo is depicted as one of the top scientists in the Nazi Party. Zemo fought both Captain America and his allies the Howling Commandos during World War II. A brilliant and sadistic scientific genius, Zemo created many weapons of mass destruction for Hitler&#x27;s army.

In an attempt to regain a level of anonymity, Zemo began wearing a reddish-pink hood over his face as he continued to build weapons for the Nazis. His activities ultimately drew the attention of Captain America, resulting in a confrontation just as Heinrich was ready to unveil his newest scientific breakthrough: Adhesive X, an extremely strong adhesive that could not be dissolved or removed by any known process at the time. It was only after the war that the adhesive-using villain Paste-Pot Pete (later known as the Trapster) found a way to neutralize it.

To ensure that the Nazis could not use Adhesive X against Allied troops, Captain America confronted Zemo in an attempt to destroy the limited supply. Captain America threw his shield at the vat to release the adhesive onto the ground. Zemo, however, was standing right next to the vat containing the chemical, which poured over his face and permanently bound his mask to his face. Believing that he had killed his rival at long last, Zemo fled to South America as Hitler and the Nazis fell and World War II ended, abandoning his long-suffering wife and toddler son, toward whom he had become physically and emotionally abusive. With an army of mercenaries loyal to him, Zemo enslaved a tribe of natives and lived as a king, as he tried desperately to find a solvent that would remove his mask. After decades passed, Captain America was revived by the Avengers. This causes Zemo to renew his rivalry with the Captain. Among his attempts included sending agents to take the place of participants of a hand-to-hand combat demonstration with Captain America to capture him. As Captain America learned that Zemo was behind this attack, he sent a taunting message on Zemo&#x27;s minions&#x27; communicator to provoke the villain into becoming more carelessly aggressive against him and thus provide an opportunity for the superhero to deal with the villain directly.

Heinrich then formed the original Masters of Evil to serve as an evil version of the Avengers; the other founding members included the villainous Black Knight, the Melter, and the Radioactive Man who were gathered by his pilot. He tried to have Adhesive X spread over New York, but the Teen Brigade seized Zemo&#x27;s pilot, preventing him from speaking, then tied him up to stop him causing trouble. They switched the adhesive with the remover made by Paste-Pot Pete. Zemo used his sceptre&#x27;s hypno-ray on the Teen Brigade, placing them under his control.

In his final battle with Captain America, Captain America used his shield to deflect the Sun&#x27;s rays and cause Zemo to shoot blindly. His ray gun&#x27;s shot hit a rock, starting an avalanche that killed him, and Captain America felt that Bucky&#x27;s death had finally been avenged.

The 13th Baron Zemo, Helmut J. Zemo, the son of Heinrich Zemo, then followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, battling Captain America many times to avenge the killing of his father. Helmut was then responsible for bringing back the Masters of Evil and then forming the Thunderbolts. He still remains the current Baron Zemo.

<text>The Glozel artifacts are a collection of over 3,000 artifacts, including forged clay tablets, sculptures and vases, some of which were inscribed, discovered from 1924 to 1930 in the vicinity of French hamlet of Glozel.

Promoted by their discoverers as proof of an advanced prehistoric civilization, the finds initiated a series of claims and counterclaims. The objects were all initially dismissed as a hoax by professional archaeologists. Later research confirmed that some of the items date back to the Iron Age, but it was not before a 1995 study ordered by the French Ministry for Culture that the &quot;prehistoric civilization&quot; thesis was rebutted and the vast majority of the finds dated to the Middle Ages, with significant presence of alterations and forgeries.

==Discovery and excavation==
The initial discovery was made on 1 March 1924 by 17-year-old Émile Fradin (born August 8, 1906, died February 10, 2010, age 103 ) and his grandfather Claude Fradin. Émile was guiding a cow-drawn plow when the cow&#x27;s foot became stuck in a cavity. Freeing the cow, the Fradins uncovered an underground chamber, with walls of clay bricks and 16 clay floor tiles, containing human bones and ceramic fragments.

Adrienne Picandet, a local teacher, visited the Fradins&#x27; farm in March, and afterwards informed the Minister of Education about the site. On July 9, another teacher, Benoit Clément, visited the Fradins representing the Société d&#x27;Émulation du Bourbonnais, later returning with a man called Viple. Clément and Viple used pickaxes to break down the chamber&#x27;s remaining walls, which they took away with them. Later, Viple wrote to Émile Fradin identifying the site as Gallo-Roman, dating to between about A.D. 100–400, and possibly of archeological importance. The January issue of the &quot;Bulletin de la Société d&#x27;Émulation du Bourbonnais&quot; mentioned the finds, intriguing Antonin Morlet, a Vichy physician and amateur archaeologist. Morlet visited the farm on 26 April, offering 200 francs to be allowed to complete the excavation. Morlet began his excavations on 24 May 1925, discovering tablets, idols, bone and flint tools and engraved stones. Morlet identified the site as Neolithic in a report entitled &quot;Nouvelle Station Néolithique&quot; published in September 1925, with Émile Fradin listed as co-author.

Two other tombs were uncovered in 1927. More excavations were performed in April 1928. After 1941, a new law outlawed private excavations, and the site remained untouched until the Ministry of Culture re-opened excavations in 1983. The full report was never published, but a 13-page summary appeared in 1995. The authors suggest that the site is medieval (roughly A.D. 500–1500), possibly containing some earlier Iron Age objects, but was likely enriched by forgeries. A group of scholars organized by René Germain held an annual colloquium about Glozel in Vichy from 1996 to 2009.

===Glozel affair and controversy===
French archaeological academia was dismissive of Morlet&#x27;s 1925 report, published by an amateur and a peasant boy. Morlet invited a number of archaeologists to visit the site during 1926, including Salomon Reinach, curator of the National Museum of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, who spent three days excavating. Reinach confirmed the authenticity of the site in a communication to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Similarly, famous archaeologist Abbé Breuil excavated with Morlet and was impressed with the site, but on 2 October, Breuil wrote that &quot;everything is false except the stoneware pottery&quot;.

At the meeting of the International Institute of Anthropology in Amsterdam, held in September 1927, Glozel was the subject of heated controversy. A commission was appointed for further investigation, arriving at Glozel on 5 November 1927. During their three-day excavation campaign, the archaeologists were observed by spectators, who were by now flocking to the site, finding various artifacts, but in their report of December 1927, the commission declared everything at Glozel with the exception of a few pieces of flint axes and stone were fake. René Dussaud, curator at the Louvre and famous epigrapher, also accused Émile Fradin of forgery. On 8 January 1928, Fradin filed suit for defamation against Dussaud.

Felix Regnault, the president of the French Prehistoric Society, visited Glozel on 24 February 1928. After briefly visiting the site&#x27;s small museum, he filed a complaint of fraud. On 25 February, the police, under the direction of Regnault, searched the museum, destroyed glass display cases and confiscated three cases of artifacts. On 28 February the suit against Dussaud was postponed due to Regnault&#x27;s pending indictment against Fradin. A new group of neutral archaeologists, called the Committee of Studies, was appointed by scholars who were uncomfortable with the ongoing controversy. They concluded that &quot;that the whole of Glozel
was a fake&quot;.

Excavating from 12 to 14 April 1928, they found more artifacts, and in their report asserted the authenticity of the site, which they identified as Neolithic. Gaston-Edmond Bayle, chief of the Criminal Records Office in Paris, analyzed the confiscated artifacts. Bayle&#x27;s report identified the artifacts as recent forgeries, and on 4 June 1929, Émile Fradin was indicted for fraud on the basis of Bayle&#x27;s report. The verdict against Fradin was reverted by an appeal court in April 1931. The defamation charge against Dussaud came to trial in March 1932, and Dussaud was found guilty of defamation.

==Dating the artifacts==

Glass found at Glozel was dated spectrographically in the 1920s, and again in the 1990s at the SLOWPOKE reactor at the University of Toronto by neutron activation analysis. Both analyses place the glass fragments in the medieval period. Alice and Sam Gerard together with Robert Liris in 1995 managed to have two bone tubes found in Tomb II C-14 dated at the AMS C-14 laboratory at the University of Arizona, finding a 13th-century date.

Thermoluminescence dating (TL) of Glozel pottery in 1974 confirmed that the pottery was not produced recently. By 1979, 39 TL dates on 27 artifacts separated the artifacts into three groups: the first between 300 BC and 300 AD (Celtic and Roman Gaul), the second medieval, centered on the 13th century, and the third recent. TL datings of 1983 performed in Oxford range from the 4th century to the medieval period.

Carbon-14 datings of bone fragments range from the 13th to the 20th century. Three C-14 analyses performed in Oxford in 1984 dated a piece of charcoal to the 11th to 13th century, and a fragment of an ivory ring to the 15th century. A human femur was dated to the 5th century.

==Glozel tablets==

Some 100 ceramic tablets bearing inscriptions are among the artefacts found at Glozel. The inscriptions are, on average, six or seven lines, mostly on a single side, although some specimens are inscribed on both faces.

The symbols on the tablets are reminiscent of the Phoenician alphabet, but they have not been conclusively deciphered. There were numerous claims of decipherment, including identification of the language of the inscriptions as Basque, Chaldean, Eteocretan, Hebrew, Iberian, Latin, Berber, Ligurian, Phoenician and Turkic.

<doc id="867895" wikidata="Q397223" url="?curid=867895" title="Agrium">
<text>Agrium Inc. was a major retail supplier of agricultural products and services in North America, South America and Australia and a wholesale producer and marketer of all three major agricultural nutrients and a supplier of specialty fertilizers in North America.

In 2018, Agrium merged with PotashCorp to form Nutrien.

==History==

Agrium was founded as Cominco Fertilizers (short for Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company) in 1931 and changed its name to Agrium in 1995. Agrium was headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Crop Production Services, Inc., a subsidiary company, was based in Loveland, Colorado and was the location of Agrium&#x27;s Retail Business Unit head office. The company was a part-owner of Canpotex, which manages all potash exporting from Saskatchewan.

On September 12, 2016, Agrium announced that it had agreed to merge with PotashCorp, which will make the combined company, Nutrien, the largest producer of potash and second-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer worldwide. Agrium divested certain U.S. assets. The merger closed on January 1, 2018.

==Business units==

Agrium operated in two business segments:

===Retail===

Agrium operated close to 1,500 retail agricultural centres in the U.S., Canada, South America and Australia under the brand names Crop Production Services (CPS), Crop Production Services Canada (CPSC), Agroservicios Pampeanos S.A. and Landmark. Crop Production Services was acquired in 1994.

On December 3, 2010, Agrium announced the completion of the acquisition of the Australian Wheat Board for a total acquisition price of $1.236-billion Australian dollars. This acquisition added to the retail division of Agrium. Roughly 40% of the AWB holdings were sold to Cargill, including the Commodity Management Business.

In October 2013, Agrium announced the acquisition of Viterra&#x27;s Canadian retail assets, after previously acquiring Viterra&#x27;s retail locations in Australia.

===Wholesale===

The Wholesale segment produced nitrogen, phosphate, potash, and sulphur-based fertilizers. This segment also owned and operated a potash mine and production facility in the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No. 345 in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a phosphate mine in Conda, Idaho, U.S.

The Wholesale segment engaged in the ownership of nitrogen-based fertilizer plants in Bahía Blanca, Argentina, and in Damietta, Egypt.

==Environmental and social impacts==
In 2003, Agrium was issued an administrative compliance order for excessive emissions at a Kennewick, Washington plant. Agrium discovered the violations at the Kennewick facility through a comprehensive Clean Air Act audit of the facility in late 2000. Agrium promptly reported the audit findings to EPA under EPA&#x27;s policy on Incentives for Self-Policing, also referred to as the &quot;Self-Disclosure Policy&quot;. In 2005, Agrium was fined for failure to disclose release of toxic gases at this same plant.

<doc id="867901" wikidata="Q3777572" url="?curid=867901" title="1922 Dutch general election">
<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 5 July 1922. They were the first elections held under universal suffrage, which became reality after the acceptance of a proposal by Henri Marchant in 1919 that gave women full voting rights. Almost all major parties had a woman elected. The number of female representatives increased from one to seven. Only the Anti-Revolutionary Party principally excluded women from the House of Representatives. Another amendment to the electoral law increased the electoral threshold from 0.5% to 0.75%, after six parties had won seats with less than 0.75% of the vote in the previous elections.

The General League of Roman Catholic Electoral Associations remained the largest party, increasing from 30 to 32 seats, whilst the Anti-Revolutionary Party increased from 13 to 16 seats, and the Christian Historical Union went from 7 to 11 seats. The left-wing Christian Democratic Party and the Christian Social Party both lost their sole seats, disappearing from the House, while the Reformed Political Party (SGP) won a seat. The SGP, an orthodox Protestant party established in 1918, was opposed to the co-operation of the Protestant ARP and CHU with the Catholics.

The Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party lost two seats, whilst left-wing splinter parties also suffered losses, and went from four to two seats.

Several liberal groups had merged in 1921 to form the Liberal State Party, but lost further seats as they were reduced from fifteen to only ten. However, a new Liberal Party led by the 85 year old Samuel van Houten, won a seat. Van Houten himself did not take the seat, which was instead occupied by his representative, Lizzy van Dorp.

The Free-thinking Democratic League maintained, against most expectations, their five seats, whilst of the remaining splinter parties, only the Peasants&#x27; League was able to survive, rising from one to two seats.

After a relatively short formation, the second Ruijs de Beerenbrouck cabinet was formed, with largely the same composition as the previous one.

<text>Bell Aliant is a brand name used by Bell Canada for telecommunications services in Atlantic Canada.

Prior to 2015, Bell Aliant Inc. (formerly Aliant Inc.) was a separate company providing telecom services in the Atlantic provinces and a few other areas throughout Canada. Bell Canada, which had been the largest shareholder in the company and most of its predecessors throughout their respective histories, took full ownership of Bell Aliant in late 2014. Shortly thereafter, Bell Aliant and its subsidiaries were wound up and their operations absorbed by Bell Canada, which nonetheless continues to use the Bell Aliant brand name in Atlantic Canada.

==History==
Bell Aliant was the successor to Aliant Inc., formed from the 1999 merger of Maritime Telegraph and Telephone Company (MT&amp;T), Island Telecom (which had been majority-owned by MT&amp;T), Bruncor (parent of NBTel), and NewTel Enterprises (parent of NewTel Communications), then the four main incumbent telephone companies in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, respectively. Bell Canada was the largest shareholder of MT&amp;T, Bruncor, and NewTel prior to the merger, and received a 53% stake in the merged company, Aliant. At the time that Aliant Inc. was being formed, the executives of the four merging companies agreed to a co-operative management strategy which would see no specific province have a Bell Aliant head office; instead the headquarters functions would be spread across its constituent companies. The telecom operating subsidiaries of each of the merging companies were later amalgamated under the name Aliant Telecom Inc. (later renamed Bell Aliant Regional Communications).
On April 14, 2006, Bell and Aliant announced plans to merge Aliant&#x27;s operations into those of Bell. Specifically, Aliant&#x27;s &quot;high growth&quot; wireless and retail (DownEast) networks would be folded into Bell&#x27;s wholly owned Bell Mobility and Bell World operations, respectively. Aliant, under a new income trust structure, would acquire Bell&#x27;s &quot;regional&quot; landline operations (i.e. outside of major city centres) in Ontario and Quebec. This created the significant challenges involved with merging English-speaking operations with French-speaking operations. The transaction was completed on July 10, 2006, and saw the appointment of Stephen Wetmore, formerly of Bell, as president and CEO. Bell Canada retained 45% of the restructured Aliant. Fund units representing about 28.5% of Bell Aliant were distributed to shareholders of Bell&#x27;s parent company, BCE. Shareholders of the former Aliant Inc. received units representing 26.5% of the firm. (The company would convert back to a regular corporation at the end of 2010.)


The purpose was to separate out the more stable (or low-growth) parts of Bell&#x27;s holdings, i.e. wireline operations in markets with relatively little competition, to satisfy investors. The restructuring was not expected to have any effect on end consumers in terms of existing pricing or bundling practices. Meanwhile, Bell Canada proper continues to have full control over its wireless and satellite/cable operations throughout Canada, as well as wireline operations in major centres such as Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and surrounding areas.

Bell Aliant has also assumed Bell&#x27;s 63.4% interests in both NorthernTel and Télébec. Since January 30, 2007, both are 100%-owned by Bell Aliant. Since 2016 they have been considered subsidiaries of BCE as Bell Aliant&#x27;s operations were consolidated into those of Bell Canada. Both firms continued to operate their own wireless networks until 2015.

On January 1, 2013, Bell Aliant completed its purchase of Dryden Municipal Telephone Service (DMTS), a municipal telephone utility in Dryden, Ontario.

On July 23, 2014, BCE announced it would privatize Bell Aliant by acquiring the interest of Bell Aliant&#x27;s public minority shareholders. On October 3, 2014, BCE announced the successful completion of its tender offer to purchase all outstanding Bell Aliant publicly held common shares. On November 3, 2014, BCE announced the formal close of the transaction as BCE acquired all remaining Bell Aliant common shares not acquired under BCE&#x27;s tender offer through a compulsory acquisition effective October 31, 2014. Bell Aliant common shares were de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on October 31, 2014.

In October 2014, Bell Aliant completed its acquisition of Ontera, the telecommunications division of the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission (a Crown agency of the Government of Ontario).

==Operations==
Currently, the company operates as &quot;Bell Aliant&quot; in Atlantic Canada. The Atlantic Canada services were known as simply &quot;Aliant&quot; until summer 2008. Similarly, the former Aliant wireless and retail networks initially operated under the &quot;Aliant&quot; brand in Atlantic Canada, albeit now under the direct control of Bell. Wireless services transitioned to the Bell brand in April 2008.

In Atlantic Canada, Bell Aliant&#x27;s services include high-speed and dial-up internet access, wireline telephone service, and IPTV cable television. Its main competitors are the region&#x27;s incumbent cable providers, EastLink (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and parts of Newfoundland and Labrador) and Rogers Communications (New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador), who had eroded Bell Aliant&#x27;s market share until mid-2009, and as of 2015, the unrelated Island Telecom, a fibre optic service provider in Prince Edward Island.

In 2009 Bell Aliant launched &quot;FibreOp,&quot; now marketed under the common Bell parent product name Fibe; as of mid-2011, the service was available to 294,000 homes and businesses in Atlantic Canada.

Bell Aliant&#x27;s email service has been excoriated in various media outlets and by customers for service failures and an outdated webmail program. A Google News search reveals some of the problems, which have persisted into 2019.

<text>Clarence Harrison DeMar (June 7, 1888 – June 11, 1958) was a U.S. marathoner, winner of seven Boston Marathons, and Bronze medalist at the 1924 Paris Olympics. He was known by the nickname &quot;Mr. DeMarathon.&quot;

==Biography==
DeMar was born in Madeira, Ohio. The 1910 Boston Marathon was DeMar&#x27;s first; he finished 2nd. Later, in 1910, he was advised by a doctor that he had a heart murmur and should stop running within a year or two. The next year at the Boston Marathon, the doctors on the starting line advised him of his heart murmur and told him that he should drop out if he were fatigued and that he should not run any more races. Nevertheless, he won in 2:21:39, a course record. DeMar was one of the twelve members of the U.S. marathon team in the 1912 Summer Olympics, where he ran poorly, finishing 12th, complaining that the coaching staff&#x27;s dictatorial control over the athletes&#x27; training had harmed the team&#x27;s performance.

Although DeMar ran a few races after the Olympics, he soon took a break from serious competition. In his autobiography, he gave his reasons as (1) continuing warnings from doctors that he was endangering his health, (2) concern that striving for individual athletic glory was incompatible with the spirit of his religion, and (3) demands on his time from the University extension courses that he was taking at Harvard and Boston University. In June 1915, DeMar received an Associate of Arts degree from Harvard while working as a printer in the Boston area.

DeMar resumed marathoning in 1917, finishing third in the Boston Marathon despite little training. He then set a course record in the Brockton Fair marathon. Sometime later, he was drafted into the army.

Although he ran some races while in the army, DeMar did not return to serious competition until 1922, when he again won the Boston Marathon in a course record 2:18:10. He repeated the victory in 1923 and 1924. In the latter year, the full Olympic distance – 26 miles, 385 yards – was run. He was selected as one of the six U.S. Olympic marathon team runners for the 1924 Summer Olympics, where he finished third.

DeMar continued his success with a second-place finish at the 1925 Boston Marathon and a third-place finish the next year. He followed that with five consecutive marathon victories: at the Baltimore Marathon in mid-May 1926; the Sesqui-Centennial Marathon (in Philadelphia) in June; the Port Chester Marathon in October; the Baltimore Marathon again in March 1927; and, on April 19, 1927, the Boston Marathon. He won at Boston again the next year to secure a spot in the 1928 Summer Olympics but ran poorly there in cool weather, finishing 27th. He would win one more Boston Marathon in 1930 at the age of 41.

In 1929, DeMar married and took a job teaching printing and industrial history at Keene Normal School to secure a more stable income. He spent time at Camp Zakelo (on Long Lake, in Maine), supervising the publication of the youth camp newspaper. In the fall of 1932, he began to work on a master&#x27;s degree (which he earned in June 1934) at Boston University. He ran, walked, and hitchhiked to Boston from Keene, New Hampshire (by one route, 90 miles) and back each week. DeMar continued running until shortly before his death, running his last Boston marathon at age 65 and a 15 kilometer race at age 69. He died of cancer at the age of 70. In 2010, DeMar was posthumously inducted into the National Distance Running Hall of Fame. The Clarence DeMar marathon has been held in Keene annually since 1978 in his honor.

<doc id="867905" wikidata="Q678972" url="?curid=867905" title="Stray Dog (film)">
<text>is a 1949 Japanese crime drama noir film directed and co-written by Akira Kurosawa, starring Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura. It was Kurosawa&#x27;s second film of 1949 produced by the Film Art Association and released by Shintoho. It is also considered a detective movie (among the earliest films in that genre) that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery. The film is also considered a precursor to the contemporary police procedural and buddy cop film genres, based on its premise of pairing two cops with different personalities and motivations together on a difficult case.

==Plot==
The film takes place during a heatwave in the middle of summer in post-war Tokyo. Murakami (Toshiro Mifune), a newly-promoted homicide detective in the Tokyo police, has his Colt pistol stolen while riding on a crowded trolley. He chases the pickpocket, but loses him. A remorseful Murakami reports the theft to his superior, Nakajima, at police headquarters. After Nakajima encourages him to conduct an investigation into the theft, the inexperienced Murakami gets a lead from one of the ladies who traveled in the trolley and goes undercover in the city&#x27;s backstreets for days, trying to infiltrate the illicit arms market. He eventually locates a dealer who agrees to sell him a stolen gun, but when Murakami arrests the dealer&#x27;s girlfriend at the exchange, he is distraught to find that she doesn&#x27;t know anything about his missing gun. 

With the aid of a self-missed test fired bullet retrieved in a tree trunk by Murakami, the police forensic firearms expert determines that Murakami&#x27;s Colt was used to mug a woman of ¥40,000. Nakajima partners him up with veteran detective Satō (Takashi Shimura). After Satō skillfully questions the girlfriend, the two detectives learn that the gun dealer Tachibana, who is using the alias of &#x27;Honda&#x27;, is a fan of baseball. They stake-out a local high-attendance baseball game looking for Tachibana and manage to lure him away from the crowd before taking him into custody. A rice ration card found on his person reveals that the gun was loaned to Yusa, a disenchanted war veteran who has become involved with the yakuza to support himself. The detectives interview Yusa&#x27;s sister, one of his yakuza associates, and his sweetheart, showgirl Harumi Namiki (Keiko Awaji); but none of these visits produce any useful leads. Satō takes Murakami to eat at his place, where he meets Satō&#x27;s wife and children. 

Murakami&#x27;s gun is used again, this time to murder another woman during a robbery. He and Satō continue to question Namiki at her mother&#x27;s house. She is still reluctant to talk, so Satō leaves to trace Yusa&#x27;s movements, while Murakami remains behind hoping that Namiki&#x27;s mother can persuade her to begin cooperating. Satō finds the hotel where Yusa is staying. He tries to call Murakami, but just as he is about to reveal Yusa&#x27;s location, the criminal (having overheard the hotel owners mention that a cop is present) shoots Satō twice before making his escape. Satō, badly wounded but alive, staggers out the door, passes out from blood loss, and is taken to the hospital. A distraught Murakami is forcibly removed from the hospital on Nakajima&#x27;s orders when he becomes disruptive and starts wailing loudly. 

The following morning, Namiki has a change of heart and informs Murakami that Yusa called and asked her to meet him at a train station so they can skip town. Murakami races to the station and manages to get a positive identification on Yusa by taking into account his age, white suit stained with mud, and left-handedness, three tips he has collected over the past few days. Yusa tries to flee and Murakami pursues him into the forest; Yusa is able to wound him in the arm, but then panics, wastes his last two bullets, and throws the gun away. Murakami, in spite of his injury, wrestles Yusa down, handcuffs him, retrieves the gun, and takes him into custody. Days later at the hospital, Satō has recovered and congratulates Murakami on receiving his first citation. Murakami admits that he sympathizes with Yusa&#x27;s situation, to which Satō replies that there are lots more like Yusa and that he will lose such sentimentality over time as he arrests more people.

==Cast==
==Production==

Kurosawa mentioned in several interviews that his script was inspired by Jules Dassin’s &quot;The Naked City&quot; and the works of Georges Simenon. &quot;Stray Dog&quot; was the first time that Kurosawa collaborated with Ryuzo Kikushima, with the former sending the latter to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to collect cases that they could use as the basis for the script of the film, choosing a case where a young detective lost his pistol. It also takes inspiration from contemporary debates in Japan about the &quot;après-guerre&quot; generation with its apparent rise in delinquency and crime. Despite being one of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s most critically renowned postwar films, &quot;Stray Dog&quot; was not always held in such high regard by the director himself. Kurosawa initially said that he thought little of the film, calling it &quot;too technical&quot; and also remarking that it contains &quot;all that technique and not one real thought in it.&quot; His attitude had changed by 1982, when he wrote in his autobiography that &quot;no shooting ever went as smoothly,&quot; and that &quot;the excellent pace of the shooting and the good feeling of the crew can be sensed in the finished film.&quot; However, Kurosawa was rankled when someone from the ASPCA accused him of infecting a dog with rabies for the movie&#x27;s opening shot of a canine panting in the heat. He had to write a letter to American occupation officials denying the allegation, and he later said that he never felt &quot;a stronger sense of regret over Japan&#x27;s losing the war.&quot;

&quot;Stray Dog&quot; was mostly shot at a studio rented by Toho with more than thirty sets built. Ishirō Honda, who would go on to direct several monster movies such as &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Mothra&quot;, served as Kurosawa&#x27;s chief assistant, shooting second unit footage for the 10-minute long sequence of Murakami roaming through Tokyo, and often doubled for Toshiro Mifune in waist shots. Kurosawa later praised Honda for helping him capture the atmosphere of post-World War II Tokyo. The film marks the first appearances of Minoru Chiaki, Noriko Honma and Isao Kimura in a Kurosawa film. Chiaki would go on to appear in ten more movies by the director, Honma played the medium in &quot;Rashomon&quot; and Kimura played the youngest of the seven samurai in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. The baseball game scene was shot at the actual Korakuen Stadium.

The film was also the debut of then sixteen-year old Keiko Awaji, who plays Harumi Namiki, a dancer and the girlfriend of Yusa, the villain of the film. She was chosen over other actresses because of her mean looks. Kurosawa described her as being too spoiled and that she could not cry on cue, and never cast her again in another movie of his. Awaji would later regret her unprofessionalism during filming. Kurosawa became so close with his cast and crew during filming that he remarked later it was difficult for him to break up with them after filming was completed.

==Release==
&quot;Stray Dog&quot; was distributed theatrically by Toho in Japan on 17 October 1949. The film received a theatrical release in the United States by Toho International with English subtitles on August 31, 1963.

==Reception==
&quot;Stray Dog&quot; holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. At the 1950 Mainichi Film Concours, it won awards for Best Actor (Takashi Shimura), Best Film Score (Fumio Hayasaka), Best Cinematography (Asakazu Nakai) and Best Art Direction (Sō Matsuyama). The film was included on &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; &quot;Best Ten&quot; of the year at third place. In 2009, the film was voted at No. 10 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;.

==Remake==
The film was remade in 1973, under the name &quot;Nora inu&quot;, for Shochiku. It was later remade for television in 2013.

An Indian Tamil film, &quot;8 Thottakkal&quot;, was loosely inspired by the film, which was remade in Kannada as &quot;8MM Bullet&quot; (2018), Telugu as &quot;Senapathi&quot; (2021), and Malayalam as &quot;Corona Papers&quot; (2023).

<doc id="867927" wikidata="Q420197" url="?curid=867927" title="Integron">
<text>Integrons are genetic mechanisms that allow bacteria to adapt and evolve rapidly through the stockpiling and expression of new genes. These genes are embedded in a specific genetic structure called gene cassette (a term that is lately changing to integron cassette) that generally carries one promoterless open reading frame (ORF) together with a recombination site (&quot;attC&quot;). Integron cassettes are incorporated to the &quot;attI&quot; site of the integron platform by site-specific recombination reactions mediated by the integrase.

== Discovery ==
Integrons were initially discovered on conjugative plasmids through their role in antibiotic resistance. Indeed, these mobile integrons, as they are now known, can carry a variety of cassettes containing genes that are almost exclusively related to antibiotic resistance. Further studies have come to the conclusion that integrons are chromosomal elements, and that their mobilisation onto plasmids has been fostered by transposons and selected by the intensive use of antibiotics. The function of the majority of cassettes found in chromosomal integrons remains unknown.

== Integron function ==
Cassette maintenance requires that they be integrated within a replicative element (chromosome, plasmids). The integrase encoded by the integron preferentially catalyses two types of recombination reaction: 1) attC x attC, which results in cassette excision, 2) attI x attC, which allows integration of the cassette at the attI site of the integron. Once inserted, the cassette is maintained during cell division. Successive integrations of gene cassettes result in the formation of a series of cassettes. The cassette integrated last is then the one closest to the Pc promoter at the attI site. The IntI-catalysed mode of recombination involves structured single-stranded DNA and gives the attC site recognition mode unique characteristics. The integration of gene cassettes within an integron also provides a Pc promoter that allows expression of all cassettes in the array, much like an operon. The level of gene expression of a cassette is then a function of the number and nature of the cassettes that precede it. In 2009, Didier Mazel and his team showed that the expression of the IntI integrase was controlled by the bacterial SOS response, thus coupling this adaptive apparatus to the stress response in bacteria. 

== Structure ==
An integron is minimally composed of:
* a gene encoding for a site-specific recombinase: &quot;intI, &quot;belonging to the integrase family
* a proximal recombination site: &quot;attI&quot;, which is recognized by the integrase and at which gene cassettes may be inserted
* a promoter: &quot;Pc&quot;, which directs transcription of cassette-encoded genes

=== Gene cassettes ===

Additionally, an integron will usually contain one or more gene cassettes that have been incorporated into it. The gene cassettes may encode genes for antibiotic resistance, although most genes in integrons are uncharacterized. An &quot;attC&quot; sequence (also called 59-be) is a repeat that flanks cassettes and enables cassettes to be integrated at the &quot;attI&quot; site, excised and undergo horizontal gene transfer.

== Occurrence ==
Integrons may be found as part of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and transposons. Integrons can also be found in chromosomes.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;super-integron&quot; was first applied in 1998 (but without definition) to the integron with a long cassette array on the small chromosome of &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;. The term has since been used for integrons of various cassette array lengths or for integrons on bacterial chromosomes (versus, for example, plasmids). Use of &quot;super-integron&quot; is now discouraged since its meaning is unclear.

In more modern usage, an integron located on a bacterial chromosome is termed a &quot;sedentary chromosomal integron&quot;, and one associated with transposons or plasmids is called a &quot;mobile integron&quot;.

<doc id="867928" wikidata="Q3326044" url="?curid=867928" title="Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument">
<text>Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument is a U.S. National Monument that includes the area around Mount St. Helens in Cowlitz, Lewis, and Skamania Counties, Washington. It was established by Congress on August 27, 1982, following the 1980 eruption. The 110,000 acre (445 km2) National Volcanic Monument was set aside for research, recreation, and education. Inside the monument, the environment is left to respond naturally to the disturbance. It was the third national monument to be managed by the U.S. Forest Service and is part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.

At dedication ceremonies on May 18, 1983, Max Peterson, head of the USFS, said, &quot;we can take pride in having preserved the unique episode of natural history for future generations.&quot; Since then, many trails, viewpoints, information stations, campgrounds, and picnic areas have been established to accommodate the increasing number of visitors each year. Due to the eruption, the state recognizes the month of May as &quot;Volcano Awareness Month&quot; and events are held at Mount St. Helens, or within the region, to discuss the eruption, safety concerns, and to commemorate lives lost during the natural disaster.

Beginning in 1983, visitors have been able to drive to Windy Ridge, only northeast of the crater.

Mountain climbing to the summit of the volcano has been allowed since 1986 and requires a permit.

== Mount St. Helens Visitor Center at Silver Lake ==
The Mount St. Helens Visitor Center at Silver Lake, about west of Mount St. Helens and five miles (8 km) east of Interstate 5 (outside the monument), opened in 1987 by then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. The center was formerly operated by the U.S. Forest Service and has been operated by Washington State Parks since October 2007.

Exhibits include the area&#x27;s culture and history, and the natural history and geology of the volcano and the eruption, including the recovery of the area&#x27;s vegetation and animal life. The Center includes a theater, a gift shop and outdoor trails. By the end of 1989, the center had hosted more than 1.5 million visitors and in 2007, approximately 300,000 guests were recorded. The space underwent its first upgrade in 2024, which included artworks, displays, and exhibits expanding on the history and connection of the Cowlitz Indian Tribe to the mountain and surrounding lands.

== Johnston Ridge Observatory ==

The Johnston Ridge Observatory is east of Castle Rock, Washington, at the end of Washington State Route 504, four miles from the mountain. Open daily mid-May through October, exhibits focus on the geologic history of the volcano, eyewitness accounts of the explosion, and the science of monitoring volcanic activity. Two movies and ranger-led programs are available every hour. A half-mile paved trail provides views of the lava dome, crater, pumice plain, and landslide deposit, with access to hiking trails in the restricted area.

The observatory is located near the site of volcanologist David A. Johnston&#x27;s camp on the morning of May 18, 1980, and was opened in 1997.

On May 14, 2023, access to the observatory was barred due to the 2023 South Coldwater Slide, a landslide that destroyed a bridge on Washington State Route 504. A team composed of U.S. Forest Service staff and volunteers hiked to the building to retrieve scientific items and supplies so that work to observe the volcano, as well as the continuation of services for visitors, could proceed at the Coldwater Science and Learning Center. Another landslide a month later would affect access to Windy Ridge. In early 2024, Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) announced that because of cost and a limited construction schedule for repairs due to a combination of weather, elevation, and issues with the terrain, the highway and access to the observatory would be closed until 2026. The USFS and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) disclosed that the site is without electricity and that the observatory may not open until spring 2027.

== Science and Learning Center at Coldwater ==

The Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center in the Coldwater Lake area opened in 1993, operated by the Forest Service, but closed in November 2007 due to a lack of funding. The grounds were reopened in 2011 for limited use, providing educational programs and events to the public.

The center reopened as the Science and Learning Center at Coldwater (SLC) in May 2013, operating as an educational facility and conference center in cooperation with the nonprofit Mount St. Helens Institute. It was open to the public on weekends from 10am to 6pm, though many of the exhibits were removed, the gift shop, theatre, and some signage remained. The campus was closed during the Covid-19 pandemic, though it was available for educational residential visits, and reopened to weekend visits in 2022 and normal visitation in 2023.

A proposed expansion of the SLC would include space for an amphitheater, overnight camping, an outdoor school, improved hiking trails, and timber lodges. Starting from a 30-year permit from the U.S. Forest service, the upgrades are projected to cost $35 million. , the beginning phases of the project has raised 20% of its projected $10 million, including a $900,000 donation from a foundation run by the Cowlitz Indian Tribe.

After the South Coldwater Slide in 2023, the center was outfitted with exhibits and other facilities as a temporary alternative to the Johnston Ridge Observatory while cleanup and repairs were underway. By 2024, students participating in educational adventures held by the SLC could camp overnight in the building.

The Winds of Change Trail #232, a short, barrier-free interpretive trail, departs from the Science and Learning Center.

== South and east sides of Mount St. Helens ==

The southern and eastern sides of Mount St. Helens are accessible only by U.S. Forest Service roads. The main roads are:
* U.S. Forest Service Road 25 – Monument entrance from U.S. Route 12 to Road 90.
* U.S. Forest Service Road 26 – Road 99 to Norway Pass to Road 25.
* U.S. Forest Service Road 81 – SR 503/Road 90 to Merrill Lake, Kalama Horse Camp, and Climber&#x27;s Bivouac.
* U.S. Forest Service Road 83 – Road 90 to Ape Cave, Ape Canyon, Lava Canyon lahar, and Smith Creek.
* U.S. Forest Service Road 90 – Monument entrance from State Route 503.
* U.S. Forest Service Road 99 – Road 25 to Bear Meadows, Meta Lake and Miner&#x27;s Car, and Windy Ridge.

=== Bear Meadows ===
Bear Meadows is an alpine meadow and viewpoint northeast of Mt. St. Helens. It is located on U.S. Forest Service Road 99. Gary Rosenquist camped here with friends on May 17–18, 1980. He started taking his famous eruption photographs from this location. The sequence of eruption photos provide a time-lapse view of the developing eruption. As the lateral blast developed, he and his friends abandoned their campsite fearing for their lives. He continued taking photos as they escaped in a car. The eruption&#x27;s lateral blast narrowly missed the site as it was deflected by a ridge just west of the meadow. In an interview with KIRO-TV in 1990, a friend called that ridge &quot;the line of death.&quot;

=== Windy Ridge ===

Windy Ridge is the closest view point accessible to the general public. Beginning in summer 1983, visitors have been able to drive to Windy Ridge, on U.S. Forest Service Road 99, only northeast of the crater. From this vantage point overlooking Spirit Lake, people see not only the evidence of a volcano&#x27;s destruction, but also the remarkable, gradual (but faster than originally predicted) recovery of the land as revegetation proceeds and wildlife returns.

=== Ape Cave ===

Ape Cave is a lava tube located in Gifford Pinchot National Forest just to the south of Mount St. Helens. Its passageway is the longest continuous lava tube in the continental United States and the third longest (in total mapped length) lava tube in North America at 2.5 miles (4,023 meters). The cave was formed approximately 1,900 years ago, is situated at an average depth of 50 feet below ground, and the air temperature remains a constant 42 degrees throughout the year.

Lava tubes are an unusual formation in this region, as volcanoes of the Cascade Range are mostly stratovolcanos and do not typically erupt with pahoehoe (fluid basalt).

Two competing mentions of its discovery exist. The cave was discovered in 1947 by a logger who almost fell into the system while operating a tractor. Another account mentions a discovery around 1951 by Lawrence Johnson, also a logger, when he noticed a tree that &quot;looked wrong.&quot; After investigating the tree, he discovered it tilted into a lava tube collapse. A few days later, Johnson brought a group of other people back to the cave, and an individual named Harry Reese was lowered to the floor and became the first known person to explore the interior. The cave system takes its moniker from a local Boy Scout troop, named the Mount St. Helens Apes, who undertook subsequent explorations of the tube after its discovery.

Ape Cave is a popular hiking destination with beautiful views of the Mount St. Helens lahar region. Ape Cave Trail No. 239, which runs along the interior of the cave, is a National Recreation Trail receiving 170,000 visitors each year.

==Trails and recreation==
In 2024, trails in the area of Spirit Lake were closed during weekdays due to a project to repair the 1985 drainage tunnel. Closure of the area for hiking is expected to last through 2027.

<doc id="867929" wikidata="Q3136940" url="?curid=867929" title="History of Canadian animation">
<text>The History of Canadian animation involves a considerable element of the realities of a country neighbouring the United States and both competitiveness and co-operation across the border.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest known pieces of Canadian animation were paper animated 35mm films created by Jean Arsin and Charles Lambly in 1910, but all of these are now lost. &quot;Romulus and Remus&quot;, a 25-minute film by Lambly for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal, was made in 1926, but is now lost. &quot;The Man Who Woke Up&quot;, created in 1919 by J.A. Norling and William Ganson Rose for the Federated Budget Board of Winnipeg, is the oldest surviving piece of animation.

In 1927, Bryant Fryer proposed silhouette animation films to Cranfield and Clarke, the producers of &quot;Carry on, Sergeant!&quot;. His films were funded by Filmart and created the &quot;Shadowlaughs&quot; shorts with Geoffrey Keighley. These were never theatrically released due to financial difficulties faced by Cranfield and Clarke. Fryer was unable to produce more animation until gaining the financial backing of Albert Gooderham in 1933. He was unable to find distributors due to a monopoly by Famous Players, which only distributed Fleischer Studios shorts.

Raoul Barré opened an animation studio with William C. Nolan in 1914, and hired Gregory La Cava and Frank Moser. Barré streamlined the animation process by reducing the amount of drawing needed. He partnered with Charles Bowers, but went into retirement in 1919 after disagreements with him. He left retirement in 1926, and animated ten &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; shorts.

Prior to 1939, animation production was a very low scale with small production that were often discouraged by theatre chains like Famous Players. Such companies did not want Canadian competition to their parent companies&#x27; product. However, independent animators such as Jack (J.A). Norling in Winnipeg, Jean Arsin and Charles Lambly in Montreal, and Harold Peberdy, Bert Cob, Walter H. Swaffield and Bryant Fryer in Toronto, were able to produce short animations, primarily for advertising and educational purposes.

====National Film Board====
The National Film Board of Canada was organized in 1939, under the leadership of John Grierson. Grierson initially contracted the Walt Disney Company for $20,000 to make five films (&quot;Stop That Tank!&quot;, &quot;The Thrifty Pig&quot;, &quot;7 Wise Dwarfs&quot;, and &quot;Donald&#x27;s Decision&quot;) for the war effort and selling war bonds. The NFB held the distribution rights for these films until 1945. Philip Ragan, an American animator, was hired as part of the agreement with the National War Finance Committee and Ragan produced over thirty films. The NFB did not have an internal animation department until Grierson brought Norman McLaren to Canada in 1941, and produced &quot;Mail Early&quot;, his first film there. McLaren requested workers in 1942, and hired from École des beaux-arts de Montréal and OCAD University. The department, Studio A, became an official unit in January 1943. By 1945, 35 of the 335 films produced by the NFB were from the animation unit.

Jim Mackay replaced McLaren as animation director in 1945. Wolf Koenig, Colin Low, and Robert Verrall joined that year. Mackay&#x27;s &quot;Teeth Are to Keep&quot; was praised by Stephen Bosustow, co-founder of United Productions of America, as &quot;one of the freshest, best pictures of its kind that we have ever had the pleasure of seeing&quot;. The NFB experimented with cel animation in the 1940s with &quot;Auprès de ma blonde&quot;, &quot;Good-Bye Mr. Gyp&quot;, and &quot;Bid It Up Sucker&quot;, but animators were still using paper cutout animation following World War II.

Mackay resigned in 1949, and was replaced by 25-year old Low in 1950. Allan Ackman started &quot;Teamwork - Past and Present&quot;, but was fired for his communist views. Low and six animators completed the film which was the first colour cel animated film by the NFB. &quot;The Romance of Transportation in Canada&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award in 1953. Evelyn Lambart disliked cel animation as it was too simplistic and had &quot;people who just did cel and didn&#x27;t have to have any brains&quot; while Koenig supported it as the only way to have fluid animation and full facial expressions.

McLaren recruited French-Canadian animators from École des beaux-arts de Montréal, including René Jodoin. Jodoin created a French animation unit in 1966, which included Laurent Coderre and Bernard Longpré. The unit was given an initial budget of $50,000. Jodoin led the unit until his replacement in 1978, by Robert Forget, who led until 1989. Yves Leduc replaced Forget and led the unit until 1996. Pierre Hébert replaced Leduc.

Koenig and Verrall co-managed the NFB animation studio from 1964 to 1967, Verrall alone until 1972, when Koenig replaced him. Koenig managed the studio until his replacement by Derek Lamb in 1975. The studio won two Academy Awards and received three other nominations during Lamb&#x27;s tenure.

The NFB suffered from financial troubles in the 1970s and enforced layoffs, including in the animation studio. The computer animation program, which was established by Forget, was suspended due to budget cuts although the NFB&#x27;s French Animated Studio, founded by René Jodoin in 1966, created Peter Foldes&#x27;s &quot;Metadata&quot; in 1971, and the &quot;Hunger&quot; in 1973. The NFB returned to computer animation in the 1980s, but was reduced under Leduc.

====Development====
John Phillips and Harry Gutkin founded Phillips-Gutkin-Associates in Winnipeg in 1948, and it was the largest animation studio in Canada in the 1950s. The company created animated commercials, but the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation banned animated commercials aimed at children. Gutkin met with John Halas in 1960, about creating &quot;T. Eddy Bear&quot;, what would have been the first Canadian animated television show, but it was not made.

&quot;Le village enchanté&quot; was the first recorded animated feature film in Canadian history and &quot;Return to Oz&quot; which was based on &quot;Tales of the Wizard of Oz&quot;, the first recorded Canadian animated television series, was the second recorded animated feature film.

Al Guest formed Spectrum Productions, the company&#x27;s name was altered multiple times, in 1957. Guest made a $1 million deal with Steve Krantz in 1967, to make 52 episodes of &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot;. Krantz sent Ralph Bakshi to oversee production. Guest attempted to not deliver the show due to non-payment, but Bakshi took any materials possible and completed the series with Krantz using material from &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. Guest was unable to afford a lawsuit and liquidated his company.

One of the main sources of work for animation companies in Canada were animated commercials, but Quebec passed legislation in 1972 prohibiting animation in commercials aided at children.

Michael Mills left the NFB in 1973, and formed Michael Mills Productions in 1974. The company&#x27;s 1980 short &quot;History of the World in Three Minutes Flat&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award.

Kenn Perkins, an animator from Winnipeg, formed Kenn Perkins and Associates in the 1960s. Cordell Barker, Brad Caslor, Christopher Hinton, and John Paizs were employed by the company. The company produced animation for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; through a contract with CBC Winnipeg for four years. The work was grueling and Caslor, the company&#x27;s second employee, left after two years to form Credo Group with Derek Mazur. Hinton later joined Credo Group.

&quot;Primiti Too Taa&quot; was the first animated film made for IMAX.

====Nelvana====
Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert, and other animators formed Laff Arts in 1967. Hirsh and Loubert reformed this with Clive A. Smith into the more professionally-named Nelvana.

Longer term successes began with the establishment of the Canadian animation studio Nelvana Limited in 1971. Before they were huge, they mainly did the production for live-action/animated shorts. These were known as Small Star Cinema, in production from 1974 until 1975. Nelvana took advantage of the new Canadian content broadcast rules to produce a successful series of acclaimed TV specials. They also had some success in the United States, working on productions like the animated segment of &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; in 1978.

Ivan Reitman gained a deal with Columbia Pictures to create an animated film and asked Gerald Potterton to oversee it. This film, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, was a box office success. The success of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; inspired Nelvana to produce &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;. The film went $3 million over budget and was a financial failure that heavily indebted Nelvana. The company produced a large amount of television content, &quot;a lot of bad television&quot; according to Hirsh, to pay off this debt.

Nelvana started creating cartoons based on toys, including the Care Bears. &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, by Nelvana, was the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film at the time of its release. They also produced &quot;Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation&quot;, &quot;The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, but those were less financially successful. In 1999, Nelvana made a $40 million deal with PBS.

===1950s-1980s===
Apart from the National Film Board, Canadian production in the commercial sphere was largely as limited as before. The biggest contribution in the 1960s and much of the 1970s was in the field of voice acting with many major television productions like &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; sporting Canadian voice actors like Paul Soles and Paul Kligman.

In the 1970s, independent companies were formed to produce low budget children&#x27;s programming. Some examples are &quot;The Undersea Adventures of Captain Nemo&quot;, and &quot;The Toothbrush Family&quot; as well as &quot;Ukaliq&quot; and &quot;The Sunrunners&quot; all written, produced and directed by Al Guest and his partner Jean Mathieson at their Toronto company Rainbow Animation.

Two new players suddenly appeared in Ottawa, with Atkinson Film-Arts producing TV specials based on the Jean De Brunhoff &quot;Babar&quot; books and the Lynn Johnston comic strip &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;, as well as the series &quot;The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin&quot;, &quot;Dennis The Menace&quot;, and animation for the film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and the specials and subsequent series of Kevin Gillis&#x27; popular &quot;The Raccoons&quot;. Disputes between Atkinson management and the &quot;Raccoons&quot; producers led Gillis&#x27; &quot;Raccoons&quot; production partner Sheldon Wiseman to form a new Ottawa studio, Hinton Animation Studios. Hinton took over animation for &quot;The Raccoons&quot;, and produced animation for projects under Wiseman&#x27;s own Lacewood Productions. When the studio&#x27;s feature film &quot;The Nutcracker Prince&quot; performed poorly at the box office, Hinton found itself unable to pay off the money it borrowed to finance the feature; the situation was further exacerbated by creative tensions between Gillis and Wiseman. Due to these problems, Hinton dissolved in 1990, bringing an end to &quot;The Raccoons&quot; and Gillis and Wiseman&#x27;s partnership the following year. Wiseman subsequently reorganized the Hinton animation staff as Lacewood Studios, which produced a new series of &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; specials, and co-produced several television series with producers in the United States and France.

In the 1980s the animation department of the French division of the CBC in Montreal took centre stage by winning two Oscars for its animation shorts: &quot;Crac&quot; in 1981 and &quot;The Man Who Planted Trees&quot; in 1987. Both were produced by Frédéric Back. In about the same period private and public colleges started offering complete animation programs. In 1984 Sheridan College of Oakville won an Oscar for &quot;Charade&quot;, by one of its graduating students, Jon Minnis.

Notable NFB shorts during this era included &quot;The Street&quot; (1976), &quot;The Big Snit&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Cat Came Back&quot; (1988).

===1990s-2000s===
With the renaissance of animation in the 1990s, Canadian animation further prospered with conventional fare from companies like Nelvana and Cinar (now part of WildBrain) while innovative work from Mainframe Entertainment such as the first computer animated series, &quot;ReBoot&quot; drew considerable success on its own.

Cinar was known for &quot;Caillou&quot;, which aired from 1997 to 2010 and then in the United States on PBS from 2000 to 2021. Although &quot;Caillou&quot; initially received positive reviews during its original run, it has drawn heavy viewer criticism since its cancellation, notably for the title character&#x27;s negative behavior starting in the first and second seasons which resulted in four episodes of the show being banned by PBS Kids.

The demand for animators during this time (and also during the slow period of the 1980s) caused a global search for excellent and skilled animators causing many talented Canadians to wander the globe to fill the demand. Many Canadians can be found worldwide in prominent positions in animation companies throughout the world. From Richard Williams directing animation on the Oscar-winning &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; in the late 1980s in Britain (while also working on his unfinished film &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot; there as well) to others directing creating and supervising animation in television and commercial studios around the world including many prominent video games such as &quot;Halo 2&quot;, &quot;Rayman&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. Canadians John Kricfalusi and Lynne Naylor were among the founders of the studio Spümcø, creating series such &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; and &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot; for television, and &quot;Weekend Pussy Hunt&quot; and &quot;The Goddamn George Liquor Program&quot; for the emerging web.

In 1997, Teletoon (a bilingual service with separate French-language and English-language feeds) was established as Canada&#x27;s first dedicated animation television channel whose broadcast licence agreement stipulated at least one original animated television series a season. The &quot;O Canada&quot; anthology series helped introduce American viewers to the works of the National Film Board.

Companies such as Montreal&#x27;s Toon Boom and Toronto&#x27;s Alias Research/Wavefront Technologies and Side Effects Software have not only helped to define international technical standards, but have assumed a leadership role within the computer software industry. Toon Boom&#x27;s &quot;Harmony&quot;, Alias/Wavefront&#x27;s &quot;Maya&quot; and Side Effects Software&#x27;s &quot;Houdini&quot; are leading animation software packages used in many animated features and special effects. From shows as simple as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (Harmony), &quot;South Park&quot; (Maya) and &quot;Angela Anaconda&quot; (Houdini) to special effects as fantastic and complex as those seen in the Harry Potter films (both software packages) and more.

In September 2000, Corus Entertainment acquired Nelvana for $540 million, complementing its children&#x27;s television networks, YTV and Treehouse TV.

Flash cartoons, which were originally released on the web, began making their way to television; such as March Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Chilly Beach&quot; (2003-2006), on the CBC, as well as Ocnus Productions&#x27; &quot;Kevin Spencer&quot; (1999-2005) and Smiley Guy Studios&#x27; &quot;Odd Job Jack&quot; (2003-2007) on the Comedy Network; also joined by the puppetry show &quot;Puppets Who Kill&quot; (2002-2006), which had similarly started as an independent one-man live theatre show. After three seasons, &quot;Chilly Beach&quot; expanded to include two feature films.

In a similar vein, the CGI science fiction comedy show &quot;Tripping the Rift&quot; aired between 2004 and 2007 on Space and Teletoon. It was animated by &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot; producer CinéGroupe, after starting out as web shorts. The &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; television series (2006) aired on G4 was animated by Canadian studio Fatkat, and based on the earlier web series of the same name. &quot;Queer Duck: The Movie&quot; (2006) was a Canadian-British-American co-production based on the web series by Mike Reiss, with similar humour also present in the series &quot;Rick &amp; Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World&quot; (2007-2009).

This also signaled the adoption of animation more aimed at adults pioneered in the United States by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and specialty blocks such as Adult Swim. Teletoon entered this market in September 2002 with its own adult programming blocks (later to be known as Teletoon at Night and Télétoon la nuit) and original programming. Teletoon originals that aired throughout the decade include &quot;Undergrads&quot; (2001) and &quot;Clone High&quot; (2002-2003) (both of which were co-produced with MTV), &quot;Daft Planet&quot; (2002), &quot;Delta State&quot; (2004-2005), &quot;Zeroman&quot; (2004), &quot;Bromwell High&quot; (2005), &quot;Station X&quot; (2005), &quot;The Wrong Coast&quot; (2005), &quot;Sons of Butcher&quot; (2005-2007), &quot;Punch&quot; (2008), &quot;Life&#x27;s a Zoo&quot; (2008-2009), and &quot;The Dating Guy&quot; (2008-2010).

G4 also launched its own Adult Digital Distraction on June 9, 2009, before being shut down by the CRTC in late 2011 for violating the station&#x27;s mandate; the block returned again in 2012. Adult Swim later came to Canada itself on July 4, 2012. The late-night Bionix block aired on YTV from September 10, 2004 to February 7, 2010, airing content aimed at an older audience than usual, including Japanese anime.

The studio a.k.a. Cartoon, led by animator Danny Antonucci, successfully pitched a number of series to U.S. networks like MTV and Cartoon Network. These have included the critically panned &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot;, the anthology &quot;Cartoon Sushi&quot;, and the better-received &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot;.

Similar success was attained by Cuppa Coffee Studios working on series like &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;, &quot;Starveillance&quot;, &quot;Glenn Martin, DDS&quot;, and &quot;Ugly Americans&quot;.

Nelvana had even experimented in the 1990s with series such as Brad Bird&#x27;s &quot;Family Dog&quot; (1993), the British Channel 4 co-production &quot;Bob and Margaret&quot; (1998-2001), &quot;Committed&quot; (2001), and &quot;John Callahan&#x27;s Quads!&quot; (2001-2002).

APTN also aired its own adult animation, &quot;By the Rapids&quot; (2008-2012), a landmark for indigenous animation. APTN Kids has also broadcast cartoons such &quot;Bizou&quot; (2007), &quot;Animism&quot; (2013), &quot;Kagagi&quot; (2014), and &quot;Lil Glooscap and the Legends of Turtle Island&quot; (2022), as well as the stop motion series &quot;Wapos Bay&quot; (2005-2011) and &quot;Guardians Evolution&quot; (2014-2015), with the former produced with the assistance of the National Film Board of Canada.

Further experimentation and exploration in the art of animation which began with the National Film Board of Canada and the works of Norman Mclaren has continued through the decades through the techniques and films of other NFB animators such as Jacques Drouin, Chris Hinton (&quot;Blackfly&quot;), Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis (&quot;When the Day Breaks&quot;), Janet Perlman and many others. A few Independent organizations such as the Toronto Animated Image Society in Toronto and especially the Quickdraw Animation Society in Calgary have also formed and continue to contribute, explore the art of animation and produce new works by emerging and established Canadian animators and artists. This exploration and blending of assorted and unusual techniques can be seen in the many boutique animation companies and independent animators that have sprung up throughout Canada and has continued to propel Canada&#x27;s reputation of interesting and innovative animation techniques. The Board also co-produced the feature film &quot;The Human Plant&quot; in 1996.

<text>Shati Al-Qurum (also written Shatti Al-Qurm) is a residential locality and district situated on the coast of Muscat, the capital of the Sultanate of Oman. Known for its upscale businesses and expensive homes, it is also notable as Muscat&#x27;s Diplomatic District due to many embassies and consulates being located there.

Shatti Al-Qurum is bordered by Qurum to the east, the Ministries and Embassies to the west and Madinat Qaboos to the south. It is a recent development, begun in the mid-1980s. The most noticeable sight while driving down the Sultan Qaboos Highway used to be the Intercontinental Hotel but today several other significant constructions have been built. Shatti is also the home of several more hotels including the Grand Hyatt,W Hotel Muscat, Crowne Plaza and budget hotels such as Days Inn. After PDO, this is the most popular destination for expatriates living in Muscat. The common and unique feature to Shatti is the ocean of white houses. Royal Opera House Muscat, cinema, theatre, schools and a hospital are also located there.

<text>is a 1963 Japanese police procedural crime film directed and edited by Akira Kurosawa. It was written by Kurosawa, Hideo Oguni, Eijiro Hisaita, and Ryūzō Kikushima as a loose adaptation of the 1959 novel &quot;King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; by Evan Hunter. Starring Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai, Kyōko Kagawa, Tatsuya Mihashi, Yutaka Sada, and Tsutomu Yamazaki, it tells the story of Japanese businessman Kingo Gondo (Mifune) struggling for control of the major shoe company at which he is a board member. He plans a leveraged buyout of the company with his life savings, when kidnappers led by Ginjirо̄ Takeuchi (Yamazaki) mistakenly kidnap his chauffeur&#x27;s son to ransom him for 30 million yen.

Production began in 1962 at Toho Studios. Shot mostly on location at Yokohama, and on set at Toho, filming lasted from 2 September to 30 January 1963. The film has been regarded as embodying the post-World War II Japanese economic miracle prior to the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, particularly in its highlighted use of the Kodama express train. The film&#x27;s complex approach to issues of social class and narrative structure have been critically analysed as substantial adaptational accomplishments. Post-production took just under a month, and after positive test-screenings in mid-February 1963, it received a wide distribution.

Released in Japan on 1 March 1963, &quot;High and Low&quot; received generally positive reviews domestically and abroad. With a budget of ¥230 million, it was the largest budget Kurosawa had worked with at the time, and became the highest-grossing film at the Japanese domestic box office that year. It was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and Best Foreign Film at the Golden Globe Awards for 1964. The film has since received greater acclaim, and is considered by some to be equal to Kurosawa&#x27;s films &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950) and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954). It is viewed as influential on police procedurals, and has been remade multiple times internationally.

==Plot==
A wealthy executive named Kingo Gondo is in a struggle to gain control of a company called National Shoes. One faction wants the company to make cheap, low-quality shoes for the impulse market as opposed to the sturdy and high-quality shoes the company is currently known for. Gondo believes that the long-term future of the company will be best served by well-made shoes with modern styling, though this plan is unpopular because it means lower profits in the short term. He has secretly set up a leveraged buyout to gain control of the company, mortgaging all he has. Just as he is about to put his plan into action, Gondo receives a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped his son, Jun. He is prepared to pay the ransom, but the call is dismissed as a prank when Jun comes in from playing outside. However, Jun&#x27;s playmate, Shinichi, the child of Gondo&#x27;s chauffeur, is missing. The kidnappers had mistakenly abducted him instead.

In another phone call, the kidnapper reveals that he has discovered his mistake but still demands the same ransom. Gondo is now forced to make a decision about whether to pay the ransom to save the child or complete the buyout. After a long night of contemplation Gondo announces that he will not pay the ransom, explaining that doing so would not only mean the loss of his position in the company, but cause him to go into debt and throw the futures of his wife and son into jeopardy. His plans are weakened when his top aide lets the &quot;cheap shoes&quot; faction know about the kidnapping in return for a promotion should they take over. Finally, after continuous pleading from the chauffeur and under pressure from his wife, Gondo decides to pay the ransom. Following the kidnapper&#x27;s instructions, the money is put into two small briefcases and thrown out from a moving train; Shinichi is found unharmed.

Gondo is forced out of the company and his creditors demand the collateral in lieu of the debt. The story is widely reported however, making Gondo a hero, while the National Shoes Company is vilified and boycotted. Meanwhile, the police eventually find the hideout where Shinichi was kept prisoner. The bodies of the kidnapper&#x27;s two accomplices are found there, killed by an overdose of heroin. The police surmise that the kidnapper engineered their deaths by supplying them with uncut drugs. Further clues lead to the identity of the kidnapper, a medical intern at a nearby hospital, but there is no hard evidence linking him to the accomplices&#x27; murders.

The police lay a trap by first planting a false story in the newspapers implying that the accomplices are still alive, and then forging a note from them demanding more drugs. The kidnapper is then apprehended in the act of trying to supply another lethal dose of uncut heroin to his accomplices, after testing the strength on a drug addict who overdoses and dies. Most of the ransom money is recovered, but too late to save Gondo&#x27;s property from auction. With the kidnapper facing a death sentence, he requests to see Gondo while in prison and Gondo finally meets him face to face. Gondo is now working for a rival shoe company, earning less money but enjoying a free hand in running it. The kidnapper at first feigns no regrets for his actions. As he reveals that envy from seeing Gondo&#x27;s house on the hill every day led him to conceive of the crime, his emotions gradually gain control over him and he ends up breaking down emotionally before Gondo after finally facing his failure.

==Production==
&quot;High and Low&quot; was filmed at Toho Studios and on location in Yokohama. The film foregrounds the modern infrastructure of the economic miracle years and the run-up to the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, including rapid rail lines and the proliferation of personal automobiles. Based on Evan Hunter&#x27;s novel &quot;King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (1959), Toho Studios purchased the rights to produce the film version of the book in the summer of 1961 for $5,000 .

Preproduction began on 20 July 1962, when Kurosawa began casting roles that had not been filled yet. Having appeared in the 1962 film &quot;My Daughter and I&quot;, directed by Kurosawa&#x27;s former assistant Hiromichi Horikawa, the decision to cast Tsutomu Yamazaki as the kidnapper may have been at Horikawa&#x27;s suggestion. During the audition Yamazaki recalled feeling anxious and nauseous, calming down only after he began exchanging lines with Kurosawa. The role launched him to acting success, appearing in two more of Kurosawa&#x27;s films—&quot;Red Beard&quot; (1965) and &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980)—and starring in the popular 1970s TV series &quot;Hissatsu Shiokinin&quot;. Kurosawa also included cameos of his previous collaborators.

=== Writing ===
Kurosawa co-wrote the screenplay with Hideo Oguni, Eijiro Hisaita, and Ryūzō Kikushima. The story was written faithfully to Evan Hunter&#x27;s novel, but contains significant differences, especially in the ending wherein Kurosawa&#x27;s ambivalent note contrasts Hunter&#x27;s optimistic embrace of his main character and his wealth. Unlike the novel too, Gondo does not catch the kidnapper himself. The script originally ended with Inspector Tokura and Gondo having a conversation before Kurosawa changed his opinion in the edit.

Similarly to &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961) and &quot;Sanjuro&quot; (1962) before, the script was written straight-to-final draft. Around this time, during the creation of &quot;High and Low&quot;, co-writer and producer Ryūzō Kikushima took a seat on the board of Kurosawa Productions. Kurosawa said after the release of &quot;Red Beard&quot; that he wrote &quot;High and Low&quot; because a friend of his had their son kidnapped. Despite not being particularly impressed with the writing of Hunter&#x27;s novel, he was apparently struck by the concept of such a kidnapping. Even though he was shocked at the brazenness and cruelty of the crime, Kurosawa felt that his criminal deserved a sympathy in tandem with the sadistic impulses he was subjected to.

=== Set design ===
Gondo&#x27;s home overlooking Yokohama is in fact two different sets. One is filmed on location, overlooking the city. The night scenes showing the same location and view were filmed with a miniature display outside the window as the location set did not photograph the outside well enough at night. The scenes with the curtains drawn were filmed at Toho Studios. The set itself was a room with an open wall, with the camera rarely entering.

An additional, large, set was made for the original final scene.

=== Filming ===
Filming began on 2 September 1962 and began with the film&#x27;s first act. Many of the takes shot for the film&#x27;s first half were ten minutes long, and may have been longer if the capacity of the cameras&#x27; magazines were larger. The film is shot using CinemaScope, a widescreen filming system. Long-distance lenses were used, particularly during the first half of the film. The main body of the first half was filmed at Toho Studios. During production of his films Kurosawa would take his frustrations out on the cast and crew, but it became worse during &quot;High and Low&quot;″s creation—it was here that his reputation of making difficulties for the studio and those working on the film began to precede him.

The kidnapping exchange scene wherein money is dropped through the open window of a Kodama express train required nine cameras to be used in the shoot. Due to budgetary restrictions on the reservation of the express train, the scene could only be done in one take. The scene is shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras. All the cameramen at Toho were required to shoot the film simultaneously, which led to all other film productions being shut down for a day. A camera was positioned under the bridge where the money drop took place, during the sequence a camera following one of the detectives on the train didn&#x27;t work.

While preparing for the train scene, the crew made numerous enquiries to Japanese National Railways; unaware of the reason for their questions one official eventually got suspicious and questioned their intentions. The train was hired and the scene was shot while the train was running along the Tōkaidō Line. Reportedly the actors rehearsed the scene on-set for a week before the one take. According to Teruyo Nogami, script supervisor on many of Kurosawa&#x27;s films, claims that Kurosawa ordered the destruction of a private home because it was blocking the kidnapper actor&#x27;s face are exaggerated. Instead a blue sheet was used to disguise alterations made to the second floor of a nearby building, a job conceived and executed just a day before filming took place.

In early 1963, the Yokohama exteriors were filmed, but the cold January weather made it difficult to act convincingly as though it were summer. During a conversation scene between actors Isao Kimura and Takeshi Kato, Kurosawa dyed the nearby river with black paint and poured dirt into it to make the environment filthier. While filming the final scene, Yamazaki burnt his hands on the wire mesh from the heat of the lighting. Filming ended on 30 January 1963.

=== Editing ===
In the editing of &quot;High and Low&quot;, Kurosawa presents past and present together at the same in the continuity of his narrative. The use of multiple cameras simultaneously during the film&#x27;s first half meant that a ten-minute scene would have a corresponding hour of footage to cut between. Mid-way through the film, Kurosawa employs colour for the first time in any of his films. Using a trail of pink smoke in a pair of shots that propel the investigation, the moment acts as a singularising pivot around which the investigation is pursued. At this point in his career, Kurosawa felt that he and his crew were still too unfamiliar with the use of colour in film, and so decided to continue shooting films in black and white. 

The original script ending was changed when Kurosawa noted the performance of Yamazaki as being especially powerful, the original final scene contained a reflective conversation between Mifune and Nakadai. Although the crew spent two weeks filming the scene, Kurosawa ultimately cut it. The film was test-screened in mid-February. The final cut is 3,924 metres of film in length.

=== Music ===
Scored by Masaru Sato, this was the eighth film he worked on with Akira Kurosawa. The film includes stock music from &quot;The H-Man&quot;, the music of which was also produced by Sato. To Kurosawa, music in films was supposed to reflect the mood of the scene, with its context and volume under tight control, the opening titles feature a slow mambo, which is used as a tone-setter and thereafter used sparingly throughout the rest of the film. This contextual focus on the use of music extended to either supporting or combatting the image with aural cues, as he did with the use of trumpets with the discovery of clues in the film. During the scene where the kidnapper is first seen by the audience, Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; can be heard on the radio. When the police are in pursuit of the kidnapper, the Neapolitan song &quot;&#x27;O sole mio&quot; is played, but the relative lack of music was intentional during the climactic scenes of his films so as not to disrupt their meaningful moments.

== Themes ==
In his analysis of intertextuality, scholar and acquaintance of Kurosawa Donald Richie notes the oppositional extremity of &quot;High and Low&quot;&#x27;s Japanese title, &quot;Tengoku to Jigoku&quot;—which translates to &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;—and underlines that by comparing Yokohama to Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. In this comparison, Mifune&#x27;s Gondo takes on the role of Dante himself, with the head detectives fulfilling the role of the angels, demigods, and Virgil. Richie writes that it is &quot;the most black and white of all of Kurosawa&#x27;s films because its eventual ambiguity is not one of character.&quot; He concludes in his moral analysis of the film that good and evil are made to coincide and made equal in their shared identity, that in realising themselves both Gondo and Takeuchi are offending the other. Stuart Galbraith IV also compares &quot;High and Low&quot; to the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, noting also that while Gondo&#x27;s house looks down on the people below, Kurosawa conducts a &#x27;hell&#x27; in Yokohama &quot;that is, in part at least, seductive.&quot; He proposes that Gondo&#x27;s &quot;nouveau riche&quot; background and moral compass match Kurosawa and Mifune&#x27;s own personalities.

When asked in 1975 whether it was correct to view the film as being anti-capitalist, Kurosawa responded:&quot;Well, I did not want to say so formally. I always have many issues about which I am angry, including capitalism. Although I don&#x27;t intend explicitly to put my feelings and principles into films, these angers slowly seep through. They naturally penetrate my filmmaking.&quot;

Stephen Prince notes, in his study of Kurosawa&#x27;s filmography, a dialectical enquiry of perspective running through the film. He underscores this by focusing on the blocking of Kurosawa&#x27;s characters and the use of modern technology that works to conceal identity. The narrative bifurcation that occurs between the wealthy Gondo&#x27;s home and the geographical shift down the hill into the shanty town below it during the second half structures Kurosawa&#x27;s framing of characters&#x27; decisions and moral perspectives. When Gondo and the kidnapper meet in the film&#x27;s final scene, &quot;the existence and structure of class relations, is veiled, mystified to the sight of both an executive living at the heights of the society and a criminal who is aware of profoundly unequal standards of living ... It is the image of Gondo&#x27;s house, not who he is personally, that triggers the crime&quot;.

To historian and film scholar David Conrad, the film&#x27;s foregrounding of Japan&#x27;s economic growth (such as the proliferation of personal luxuries, cars, air conditioning) reflects its growing internationalism. This is observed through elements such as the Old West cowboy outfits Jun and Shinichi are seen playing in, and the nightclub seen towards the end of the film. In particular, Conrad draws attention to the narrative&#x27;s drug-related criminal theme and waste management as aspects that receive attention during the police investigation as indicative of the concerns of contemporary society. He comments that despite the usual association of Kurosawa&#x27;s films with a humanistic sentiment, &quot;High and Low&quot; does not &quot;question the desirability of the death penalty as punishment.&quot; In addition he describes &quot;the specter of miscegenation&quot; that is evoked in the nightclub scene, broaching a &quot;taboo topic in 1960s Japan&quot; while subtly placing foreign influence under suspicion by linking it to criminality.

Film scholar James Goodwin views the narrative&#x27;s investigative structure to be an interrogation of social divisions and the nature of power on the human spirit. He compares the third act&#x27;s showdown in the unrecovered slum with the sump in &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; (1948) and the bombed out factories in &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot; (1960) as functional representations in the environment of the social harm of executive power. Gondo&#x27;s heroic actions as the protagonist are questioned by his similarity to the kidnapper. Similarly, Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto views this sense of bifurcated identity to present the film as an embodiment of urban anxiety during Japan&#x27;s post-World War II recovery. New train lines were being built, the urban poor were being expelled from the cities, and the &quot;emergence of a new urban topography meant that the old map of Tokyo was no longer useful.&quot; The spatial reorganisation occurring in Yokohama is thus an interpretative act in the investigation which forms part of the characters&#x27; subjectivity. He concludes that it does not fully reflect a renewed sense of nationhood, however, and considers its class commentary &quot;reactionary&quot;.

Philosopher Gilles Deleuze writes in his book &quot;Cinema 1: The Movement Image,&quot; that &quot;High and Low&quot; demonstrates the situation-action paradigm in its structure; that is, the second half is a &quot;senseless, brutal action&quot; after the confined and theatrical space of its situational first half. To Deleuze, this transition from situation to action represents an expansion of space which sees the exploration and exposition of &#x27;heaven and hell&#x27;; at the same time, the Kurosawan hero crosses through that space laterally. The process of the situation-action paradigm in the film represents a mutual agreement across the class divide.

==Release==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;High and Low&quot; was released in Japan on 1 March 1963. Upon &quot;High and Low&quot;″s release in Japan, people called the Kurosawa household and threatened to kidnap his daughter. As a precaution, she was driven to and from school everyday, and grounded in order to prevent a potential kidnapping. During the production of &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot;, Kurosawa had been approached to direct a documentary of the 1964 Summer Olympics after &quot;High and Low&quot; finished production. While he was initially interested, by the release of &quot;High and Low&quot;, the Olympics were just a year and a half away, and the budget his staff submitted to the Organising Committee and Toho was considered excessive. His interest waned, and he officially backed out three weeks after the wide release of &quot;High and Low&quot; on 21 March. The documentary, &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot;, was eventually directed by Kon Ichikawa, and had a similar budget and crew to what Kurosawa had asked for.

In August 1963, the film was entered into the Venice Film Festival, being nominated for the Golden Lion even though it would not see a general release in Italy for a few years afterwards. The film was released by Toho International with English subtitles in the United States on 26 November 1963. Debuting in Toho Cinema, New York, the film acquired a wider, though modest, distribution through Walter Reade–Sterling. It received a wider release in Europe from 1967 onwards, premiering in the United Kingdom in April and Spain in July; but not in France until 1976. The film was re-released in the United States, on new 35mm prints in 1986, and again in 2002. In January and February 2023 the BFI ran a Kurosawa Season hosted by Asif Kapadia, Sonali Joshi, and Ian Haydn Smith.

=== Home media ===
A VHS version of the film was released in 1988 by Pacific Arts Video. Another VHS was released by Home Vision Cinema on 6 June 2000. The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD on 14 October 1998, and again with updated picture and sound quality on 22 July 2008. A Blu-ray version was released on 26 July 2011; included are interviews with Tsutomu Yamazaki and Toshiro Mifune, an audio commentary by Stephen Prince, and a 37-minute documentary detailing the film&#x27;s production. The British Film Institute released a DVD of the film on 28 March 2005, with a Blu-ray version released on 27 January 2025. The BFI and Criterion have also released &quot;High and Low&quot; alongside other Kurosawa films in box sets.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
The film was a box office success in Japan, garnering ¥460.2 million in ticket sales and becoming the highest grossing domestic film that year. The assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, during the film&#x27;s opening week at the Toho Cinema in New York, dampened ticket sales. By the end of its eight-week run in that cinema alone, the film generated more than $46,800 total in box office returns. Beginning in its fifth week, the penultimate week of December in 1963, it started to play in different cinemas across New York. The critical and commercial success of Kurosawa&#x27;s films during the 1960s prompted 20th Century Fox to approach him with an offer to direct the Japanese half of &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970)&quot;,&quot; a film about the attack on Pearl Harbor. Kurosawa initially accepted the job, but was fired during filming and replaced as the director. &quot;High and Low&quot; was re-released in the United States in 2002 as part of the &quot;Kurosawa &amp; Mifune&quot; film festival; a multi-title release that in total accrued $561,692.

=== Critical response ===

==== Contemporary opinion ====

Contemporary reviews of &quot;High and Low&quot; were generally positive, but somewhat mixed. Critic Masahiro Ogi praised Kurosawa&#x27;s eye for detail, contrasting &quot;High and Low&quot;&#x27;s details to the way many contemporary Japanese films used them superfluously. However, Tadao Sato believed it, along with other works of Kurosawa&#x27;s made after &quot;I Live in Fear&quot; (1955), to be drained of thematic and sentimental meaning. He accused the characters of acting irrationally, particularly concerning the motivation of Yamazaki&#x27;s kidnapper.

Most American reviewers found its formal style captivating, but did not think the source content was worthy of the art. Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; questioned why Kurosawa made the film, but said he did not want to discourage people from seeing it, as &quot;two hours and twenty three minutes of fine entertainment are not a commonplace achievement.&quot; He commended Kurosawa and every person who worked on the film for executing an excellent detective thriller. In &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s review, Kurosawa&#x27;s scene composition was praised, as was his ability to build suspense, declaring &quot;High and Low&quot; to be a &quot;triumph of man over matter&quot;; yet the review criticised its pacing after the kidnapper&#x27;s identity is discovered, further referring to the film as &quot;hackneyed, and at times impausible [sic]&quot;. Upon release in the United States, some critics questioned whether investigative techniques such as handwriting profiling and voiceprint analysis were possible in Japan at the time.

Judith Crist of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; referred to the film as &quot;detecting without glamour, suspense created by reality&quot;, praising the expansion of the novel&#x27;s moral conflict; but she did not consider it one of the ten best films of the year. &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared the film to be &quot;one of the best detecting thrillers ever filmed,&quot; going on to commend the performances of Mifune and Nakadai and finally commenting on Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;remarkable movie mosaic, both spine-tingling and compassionate&quot;. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; considered it a structural departure from Kurosawa&#x27;s earlier films, celebrating &quot;High and Low&quot;&#x27;s camera work and social perspective.

&quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, viewing the film at the Venice Film Festival, dismissed it as &quot;turgid and disappointing&quot;. Upon release in the UK in 1967, a review in the magazine by Robert Vas referred to &quot;High and Low&quot;&#x27;s structure as &quot;definitive and divergent at the same time.&quot; Vas praised the film&#x27;s technical elements, such as the lighting and blocking, however, he criticised the film&#x27;s ending, negatively comparing it to Kurosawa&#x27;s 1952 film &quot;Ikiru&quot; and referred to the final meeting as a &quot;simple, meagre point&quot; between obvious metaphors. A negative review in &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; dismissed the film&#x27;s modern context and its &quot;metaphysics and morality [...] taking precedence over suspense&quot;, despite praising the train scene as &quot;beautiful&quot;, it further critcised the film for police apologia and having sympathy for its rich protagonist.

==== Retrospective opinion ====

Retrospective reviews of &quot;High and Low&quot; have been almost universally positive, with the film being referenced by reviewers and filmmakers as an important work in Kurosawa&#x27;s filmography. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;High and Low&quot; has an approval rating of 96% based on 24 critic reviews, with an average score of 8/10. As of 2024, it was the 6th highest-rated feature film on the social film cataloguing site Letterboxd, as an average of the site&#x27;s user ratings; it is the second-highest rated Kurosawa film on the site, after &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. On the media database IMDb, the film is the 84th highest-rated film as an average of user reviews.

Prior to the 1986 American re-release of &quot;High and Low&quot;, Paul Attanasio, writing in &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; favourably compared the film&#x27;s plot and symbolism with William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. He wrote that it did not count among Kurosawa&#x27;s masterpieces, but that it is &quot;in a way, the companion piece&quot; to &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; (1957), Kurosawa&#x27;s adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;: &quot;[&quot;High and Low&quot; is] &quot;Macbeth,&quot; if Macbeth had married better.&quot; Tsutomu Yamazaki, viewing the film nearly 30 years after its release at the Sydney Film Festival, still considered the film &quot;fresh and interesting&quot;, but cringed upon seeing his own acting. Meanwhile, Yutaka Sada considered it his best performance in all of Kurosawa&#x27;s films. David Parkinson, writing for &quot;Empire&quot; in 2006, gave it four out of five stars, commenting on the film&#x27;s use of &quot;deceptive appearance&quot; to illustrate that &quot;all men are essentially equal and the only thing that really separates them are the choices they make in the depths of a crisis.&quot; Scott Tobias wrote for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2008 that the film&#x27;s split nature turned a &quot;mundane follow-through of police work into the stuff of white-knuckle suspense.&quot;

In a 1988 special edition of &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; magazine, a poll of readers and 39 critics ranked the film the second best film of 1963, behind only &quot;The Insect Woman&quot;. In 2009, &quot;High and Low&quot; came 13th on the list of &quot;The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;. Film director Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker&quot; in 2014, and on the list of his 84 favorite films in 2024. In 2024, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named the film the 42nd best film noir, saying it &quot;stretches what initially seems like a straightforward procedural to the level of Shakespearean tragedy&quot;. That same year, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine said it was Kurosawa&#x27;s 5th best film, and that its first half is &quot;most tension-filled ransom exchange sequence ever filmed&quot;.

Reportedly after the film&#x27;s release, the number of kidnappings in Japan increased slightly. Kurosawa, in emphasizing the lenient sentencing of Japanese kidnapping laws, had intended to inspire tougher sentences; but was instead blamed for their increase. &quot;High and Low&quot; is said to have been partially responsible for reforming the Penal Code of Japan in 1964.

The film is often considered among Kurosawa&#x27;s greatest works, despite failing to achieve the same level of notoriety as &quot;Rashomon&quot; or &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. Film scholar Audie Bock appraised the film as the last of Kurosawa&#x27;s great humanistic dramas, believing his subsequent films to lack its moral sense. It has been compared to Kurosawa&#x27;s earlier police procedural &quot;Stray Dog&quot; (1949), with their moral themes and depiction of contemporary Japan—during midsummer, in the investigation of a crime.

&quot;High and Low&quot; has been viewed as influential on the genre of police procedurals, including Bong Joon-ho&#x27;s &quot;Memories of Murder&quot; (2003) and David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007). The 2019 Korean film &quot;Parasite&quot;, directed and co-written by Bong Joon-ho, has a similar premise as &quot;High and Low&quot;: a family living in an expensive house on a hill are unknowingly shadowed by criminals living in the poorer, lower part of the city. Bong confirmed that &quot;Parasite&quot;″s themes of class disparity, as well as the design of the wealthy family&#x27;s house, were directly inspired by Kurosawa&#x27;s film. The design of a set in &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022), and the premise of a deleted scene for the film, were revealed by its production designer to have taken inspiration from &quot;High and Low&quot;. &quot;The Batman&quot;″s director, Matt Reeves, had previously cited Kurosawa as one of his filmmaking heroes. American director and actor Chris Weitz named &quot;High and Low&quot; his favourite Kurosawa film, stating that he&#x27;s &quot;drawn a lot from [it]&quot;.

The Indian film &quot;Inkaar&quot; (1977) has been described as a Bollywood reproduction of &quot;High and Low&quot;. The rights to remake the film were acquired by Universal in 1993, Martin Scorsese was set to direct a script written by David Mamet, but the project lingered in development purgatory; an attempt to revive it with Scorsese as co-producer in 2001 also failed to materialise. In 2007 the film was adapted into a J-drama by Yasuo Tsuruhashi for TV Asahi. The plot of the 2023 miniseries &quot;Full Circle&quot; was inspired by &quot;High and Low&quot;. Apple Original Films announced in 2024 that Spike Lee will be directing a reinterpretation of the film titled &quot;Highest 2 Lowest&quot;, starring Denzel Washington, Ice Spice, ASAP Rocky, and Jeffrey Wright. In collaboration with A24, filming started in March and wrapped in June, set to be released in the spring of 2025.

<text>The Afanc (, sometimes also called Addanc, ) is a lake monster from Welsh mythology. Its exact description varies, being described as resembling a crocodile, beaver or dwarf-like creature, or a platypus and is sometimes said to be a demon. The lake in which it dwells is also uncertain and it is variously said to live in Llyn Llion, Llyn Barfog, near Brynberian Bridge or in Llyn yr Afanc, a lake near Betws-y-coed that was named after the creature.

==Legends and traditions==
The afanc was a monstrous creature that, like most lake monsters, was said to prey upon any foolish enough to fall into or swim in its lake.

One of the earliest descriptions of it is given by the 15th-century poet Lewys Glyn Cothi, who described it as living in Llyn Syfaddon, in Powys.

One tale relates that it was rendered helpless by a maiden who let it sleep upon her lap; while it slept, the maiden&#x27;s fellow villagers bound the creature in chains. The creature was awakened and made furious; its enraged thrashings crushed the maiden, in whose lap it still lay. It was finally dragged away to the lake Cwm Ffynnon, or killed by Peredur (Percival, Peredur&#x27;s name in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; telling of the Arthurian cycle).

In the tale, Peredur son of Efrawg, translated by Lady Charlotte Guest in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; taken from the &quot;White Book of Rhydderch&quot; and &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;, the &quot;Addanc of the Lake&quot; resides in a cave near the &quot;Palace of the Sons of the King of the Tortures&quot;. The palace is so named because the Addanc slays the three sons (chieftains) of the king each day, only for them to be resurrected by the maidens of the court. It is not stated why this cycle of violence continues, but when Peredur asks to ride with the three chieftains, who seek out the Addanc daily, they state that they will not accept his company as if he was slain they would not be able to bring him back to life.

Peredur continues to the cave on his own, wishing to kill the creature to increase his fame and honour. On his journey he meets a maiden who states that the Addanc will slay Peredur through cunning, as the beast is invisible and kills his victims with poison darts. The maiden, actually the Queen of Constantinople, gives Peredur an adder stone that will make the creature visible.

Peredur ventures into the cave and with the aid of the stone, pierces the Addanc before beheading it. When the three chieftains arrive at the cave they state that it was predicted that Peredur would kill the Addanc.

==Iolo Morganwg==
According to a version of an afanc legend as put forth by the famous writer of myths and folklore Edward Williams known as Iolo Morganwg, its thrashings caused massive flooding which ultimately drowned all inhabitants of Britain save for two people, Dwyfan and Dwyfach, from whom the later inhabitants of Prydain descended.

According to one version of the myth, also put forth by Iolo Morganwg, Hu Gadarn&#x27;s oxen dragged the afanc out of the lake; once it was out of the water, it was powerless and could be killed. This version locates the creature in Llyn Llion.

==Orthography==
The correct rendering of this name in Modern Welsh depends on the specific source. The Middle Welsh of Llyn Barfog is in Modern Welsh, a word which is now used to mean &quot;beaver&quot;. The form is also used in the Red Book of Hergest and most other medieval sources. In the Middle Welsh version of Peredur&#x27;s tale in the &quot;White Book of Rhydderch&quot;, the creature in the cave is called the . is by far the most common spelling.

==In popular culture==
An afanc appears in &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, the final book in Susan Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Dark is Rising&quot; sequence.

In the &quot;Merlin&quot; episode &quot;The Mark of Nimueh&quot;, the villainess Nimueh creates an afanc by molding a small figure out of clay and hatching it from an egg-like container. The creature spreads a deadly disease across Camelot through the water it inhabits, until Merlin and Arthur manage to destroy it.

In China Miéville&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;The Scar,&quot; the floating city-state of Amarda summons an avanc, attaching it to the city and using its huge pulling-power to cross the ocean.

In the October Daye series by Seanan McGuire, afanc are a marsh creature about the size of a cow with fur, scales, and a &quot;disturbing&quot; number of teeth.

The &quot;Super Sentai&quot; TV series &quot;Juken Sentai Gekiranger&quot; features the Genjuken Warrior known as Genju Afanc-Fist Sojo who is modeled after the rodent depiction of the Afanc and is also based on the rat of the Chinese zodiac. In &quot;Power Rangers Jungle Fury&quot;, he is adopted into Badrat of the Phantom Beasts.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; video game, the culture of Dunland, sparsely described by J. R. R. Tolkien, is heavily based on the Welsh mythology. The &quot;Avanc&quot; appear as wildlife monsters in Dunland with an appearance resembling that of a crocodile with fur and scales.

In the 2024 YA novel &quot;The Wild Huntress&quot; by Emily Lloyd-Jones (based on Welsh mythology), the title character Branwen wields a dagger made from an afanc fang, Prince Pryderi was raised and exploited by an afanc as a young boy, and the Otherking’s champion huntress Cigfa wears a cloak of afanc scales.

== Afanc in Welsh Folklore ==
The &quot;Afanc&quot; is a creature from Welsh Folklore, often described as a dangerous, water-dwelling monster. While some stories picture it as a crocodile-like beast, others imagine it as a giant serpent. It symbolizes the untamable power of nature, particularly water. In one famous myth, heroes battle the &quot;Afanc&quot; to stop a flood that threatens their village. The creature&#x27;s presence in these tales underscores not just fear, but respect for nature&#x27;s raw force. 

David Williams, in his book Welsh Folklore: A Guide to the Mythical and the Mysterious, highlights that the Afanc was a symbol of both danger and courage in Welsh myth.

<doc id="867952" wikidata="Q1341875" url="?curid=867952" title="Drunken Angel">
<text>is a 1948 Japanese yakuza noir film directed and co-written by Akira Kurosawa. It is notable for being the first of sixteen film collaborations between director Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune.

== Plot ==
Sanada is an alcoholic doctor (the titular &quot;drunken angel&quot;) in postwar Japan who treats a small-time yakuza named Matsunaga after a gunfight with a rival syndicate. The doctor, noticing that Matsunaga is coughing, diagnoses the young gangster with tuberculosis. After frequently pestering Matsunaga, who refuses to deal with his illness, about the need to start taking care of himself, the gangster finally agrees to quit boozing and womanizing and allow Sanada to advise care for him. The two enjoy an uneasy friendship until Matsunaga&#x27;s fellow yakuza and sworn brother, Okada, who is also the abusive ex-boyfriend of the doctor&#x27;s female assistant Miyo, is released from prison. In the meantime, Sanada continues treating his other patients, one of whom, a young female student, seems to be making progress against her tuberculosis.

Matsunaga quickly succumbs to peer pressure and stops following the doctor&#x27;s advice, slipping back into old drinking habits and going to nightclubs with Okada and his fellow yakuza. Eventually, he collapses during a heated dice game after losing heavily, and is taken to Sanada&#x27;s clinic for the evening. Okada shows up and threatens to kill the doctor if he does not tell him where to find Miyo, and while Matsunaga stands up for the doctor and gets Okada to leave, he realizes that his sworn brother cannot be trusted. Matsunaga then finds out that the boss of his syndicate, who gave him control of Okada&#x27;s territory during his time in prison, intends to sacrifice him as a pawn in the war against the rival syndicate. Okada orders the storeowners in his territory to refuse service to Matsunaga as retaliation for challenging him.

Sanada goes to report Okada&#x27;s harassment to the police, while Matsunaga discreetly leaves the clinic and goes to Okada&#x27;s apartment. There, he finds the yakuza with Nanae, Matsunaga&#x27;s former lover, who had abandoned him due to his failing health. He angrily tries to stab Okada, but starts to cough up blood; Okada then stabs him in the chest, and Matsunaga stumbles outside before he succumbs to his wounds and dies.

Okada is later arrested for the murder, but Matsunaga&#x27;s boss refuses to pay for his funeral. A local barmaid, who had feelings for Matsunaga, pays for it instead and tells Sanada that she plans to take Matsunaga&#x27;s ashes to be buried on her father&#x27;s farm, where she had offered to live with him. The doctor retorts that while he understands how she feels, he cannot forgive Matsunaga for throwing his life away. Just then, his patient, the female student, arrives and reveals that her tuberculosis is cured and the doctor happily leads her to the market for a celebratory sweet.

==Cast==

* Takashi Shimura as Doctor Sanada
* Toshiro Mifune as Matsunaga
* Reisaburo Yamamoto as Okada
* Michiyo Kogure as Nanae
* Chieko Nakakita as Nurse Miyo
* Eitarō Shindō as Takahama
* Noriko Sengoku as Gin
* Shizuko Kasagi as Singer
* Masao Shimizu as Oyabun
* Yoshiko Kuga as Schoolgirl

==Production==
The film was produced by Toho and shot in black-and-white. During writing for the film, Keinosuke Uekusa met up with a yakuza life-model to develop the character of Matsunaga; while he and Kurosawa had intended for his counterpart to be a morally upright humanistic young doctor, the character was difficult to conceptualise and was changed when the two remembered an encounter they had an encounter with an unlicensed alcoholic doctor in Tokyo&#x27;s black market district. The film was built around a pre-existing set, used in Kajirō Yamamoto&#x27;s &quot;These Foolish Times&quot;. While looking for an actor to play Matsunaga, Kurosawa was told by one of the casting directors about Mifune, who was auditioning for another movie where he had to play an angry character. Kurosawa watched Mifune do this audition, and was impressed by Mifune so that he cast him as Matsunaga. On the film&#x27;s Criterion Collection DVD, Japanese-film scholar Donald Richie comments that Kurosawa was impressed by the athletic agility and &quot;cat-like&quot; moves of Mifune, which also had bearing in his casting.

Kurosawa slipped several references to the occupation, all of them negative, past the censors. The opening scene of the film features unlicensed prostitutes known as &quot;pan pan&quot; girls, who catered to American soldiers. The gangsters and their girlfriends all wear Westernized clothing and hairstyles. Kurosawa was not allowed to show a burned-out building in his black-market slum set, but he did heavily feature the poisonous bog at the center of the district. English-language signage was also not allowed, but the markets on set have several examples of English usage on their signs. The dance scene in the nightclub features an original composition (&quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;, sung by Shizuko Kasagi) with lyrics by Kurosawa, satirizing American jazz music; Kasagi imitates Johnny Weissmuller&#x27;s famous yell from the &quot;Tarzan&quot; movies, and the way Kurosawa frames the singer parodies the American film noir movie &quot;Gilda&quot;. The censorship board was unable to catch these subtle breaches due to overwork and understaffing, but censors did require Kurosawa to rewrite the film&#x27;s original, more &quot;gruesome&quot; ending.

A 150 minute cut was made but never released, all existing negatives and prints are of the 98 minute cut.

The film was made in the context of a series of labor disputes with the Toho company. Since the end of 1947, during which the union-run studio was becoming increasingly less profitable, the union&#x27;s influence on filmmaking was waning and Kurosawa managed to produce the film with minimal interference. After the film&#x27;s completion, the strikes escalated, upon which Kurosawa left Toho, being both disillusioned by studio executives&#x27; attitudes to the union and by the state of siege the occupying strikers were put under by police and American military forces. In his memoir Kurosawa writes that the studio &quot;I had thought was my home actually belonged to strangers&quot;.

===Music===
Kurosawa used music to provide contrast with the content of a given scene. In particular was his use of &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot; by J. E. Jonasson. During filming, Kurosawa&#x27;s father died. While he was in a sad state, he heard &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot; playing in the background, and the whimsical music made him even more depressed.

Kurosawa decided to use this same effect in the film, at the low point in the life of Matsunaga, when the character realizes that he was being used all along by the syndicate boss. Kurosawa had the sound crew find the exact recording of &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot; that he had heard after his father died, and had them play the instrumental beginning of the song repeatedly for the scene in which Matsunaga walks down the street after leaving the boss. In the opening scene for Okada, Kurosawa wanted him to perform on guitar &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;. Originally &quot;Die Moritat von Mackie Messer&quot; which was a song composed by Kurt Weill with lyrics by Bertolt Brecht for their music drama &quot;Die Dreigroschenoper&quot;, but the studio could not afford the rights to the song.

==Themes==

Stephen Prince in his analysis of Kurosawa&#x27;s filmography considers the &quot;double loss of identity&quot; present within the film. One loss implying a reformation of social identity whereby the progressive individual should separate themselves from the family (embodied in the yakuza), and the other being symptomatic of a &quot;national schizophrenia&quot; that has resulted from the Americanization of Japan. In the film the young are cut off from the past but still bound by its social mores. Prince writes that the narrative and spatial confinement of much of the film close to the sump returns the action to sickness, posing the question of how recovery can emerge from a humane ethic under post-war conditions. 

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Drunken Angel&quot; was released in Japanese cinemas on 27 April 1948. 

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; has a 93% approval rating.

Writing in 1959 for the New York Times, Bosley Crowther cites the film&#x27;s developing &quot;brooding and brutish mood&quot; and &quot;poisonous atmosphere&quot; in his positive appraisal of its symbolic moral conflict. He also gives a positive account of the acting and Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;forceful imagery&quot;, despite criticizing some of the film&#x27;s &quot;derivative techniques&quot; and clichés.

==Legacy==
&quot;Drunken Angel&quot; is often considered Kurosawa&#x27;s first major work. The director later reflected on the film&#x27;s structural weakness which he mostly attributed to Mifune&#x27;s intense screen-presence, one which overshadowed Shimura&#x27;s role as the moral center of the film. 

In &quot;The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films&quot; (2003), Mark Schilling cited the film as the first to depict post-war yakuza, although he noted the movie tends to play off the yakuza film genre&#x27;s common themes rather than depict them straightforwardly.

<text>Melksham () is a town and civil parish on the River Avon in Wiltshire, England, about northeast of Trowbridge and south of Chippenham. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 18,113.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Excavations in 2021 in the grounds of Melksham House found fragments of locally made pottery from the early Iron Age (7th to 4th centuries BC). There is evidence of settlement continuing into the later Iron Age and Roman periods, including Roman clay roof tiles.

Melksham developed at a ford across the River Avon. The name is presumed to derive from &quot;meolc&quot;, the Old English for milk, and &quot;ham&quot;, a village. On John Speed&#x27;s map of Wiltshire (1611), the name is spelt both &quot;Melkesam&quot; (for the hundred) and &quot;Milsham&quot; (for the town itself).

Melksham is also the name of the Royal forest that occupied the surrounding of the area in the Middle Ages.

=== Landowners ===
In 1268, Henry III of England gave the manor of Melksham to Amesbury Abbey for the souls of his late cousins Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany and Arthur I, Duke of Brittany.

In 1539 the prioress and nuns of Amesbury surrendered to the king their Melksham estates, which they had held for some 250 years. This property, which consisted of the lordship of the manor and hundred, was in 1541 granted to Sir Thomas Seymour. He then sold it to Henry Brouncker, who also had lands nearby at Erlestoke. At some uncertain date, perhaps about 1550, Brouncker built a residence for himself near Melksham church on the site of an earlier mansion. This was known as Place House.

Three generations of the family lived here: Henry Brouncker the founder, (d.1569), his son, Sir William, and his grandson Henry. On the death of this last Henry, about 1600, it became manifest that the Brouncker estate was heavily encumbered, and in the course of the next twenty or thirty years, all the property was alienated with the exception of Erlestoke, where William Brouncker, the heir, retired with his wife Anne, daughter of Sir John Dauntesey. Meanwhile, Place House was occupied for ten or eleven years by Henry Brouncker&#x27;s widow and her second husband, Ambrose Dauntesey. After their death, in 1612, the house apparently was occupied by the steward, and afterwards it was conveyed to Sir John Danvers, who married into the family, in 1634. Danvers died in 1655 and the lordship of Melksham passed to his son, who then conveyed the estate to Walter Long the Younger, of Whaddon. The lordship remained in the Long family, who were descended from the first Henry Brouncker, until the early part of the 20th century, having passed to the 1st Viscount Long of Wraxall.

===Melksham Bank===
An announcement was made in the &quot;Bath Chronicle&quot; in June 1792 of the establishment of the Melksham Bank by the firm of Awdry, Long &amp; Bruges. In November 1813 the misquoting of part of an advertisement in two London newspapers caused panic amongst the bank customers, many of whom quickly withdrew their money, reportedly causing &quot;some bustle&quot; among the partners of the bank. There was further trouble in 1812, when the bank was listed on a Parliamentary Paper of the House of Commons under the title &quot;Country Banks Becoming Bankrupt&quot;.

Moule&#x27;s bank became the North Wilts Banking Company in 1835, which merged in 1877 to form Capital and Counties Bank. The latter developed a nationwide branch network and was taken over by Lloyds Bank in 1918.

===Masonic Lodge===
The Chaloner Lodge of Freemasons (no.2644) was named after its first Worshipful Master Richard Godolphin Walmesley Chaloner, 1st Baron Gisborough, who, when not in London, resided at Melksham House. He was the brother of the 1st Viscount Long. The lodge was consecrated on 27 February 1897, with the first meeting scheduled for 4 pm 19 March, held at the town hall. Writing from London while attending his Parliamentary duties as MP for Westbury, he complained that this date was inconvenient due to his having to be at Melton Mowbray to ride in the House of Commons point to point steeplechase the next day. Despite this, the meeting went ahead and Chaloner initiated 13 of the candidates, returning to London overnight by train, getting virtually no sleep before his ride in the steeplechase early the next morning, resulting in him twice falling heavily from his horse. Later while deciding what extra furniture the lodge required, he asked that he have a special footstool, as his chair was high and his feet &quot;dangled unpleasantly&quot;.

===The Spa===
In 1815 the Melksham Spa Company was formed by a group of &#x27;respectable gentlemen&#x27;, with names such as Methuen, Long and others, all of whom had done very well from the now declining textile industry. Their aim was to promote a spa, after abortive attempts to find coal had uncovered two springs. As a consequence they built six large three-storeyed, semi-detached lodging houses forming a crescent, a pump room and hot and cold private baths. This suburban area at the southern end of the town is now known as The Spa, belonging to the civil parish of Melksham Without. A plan for a similar crescent on the north side never materialised. Simultaneously an Act was obtained to &#x27;improve the pleasing town of Melksham&#x27; by paving and improving its footways and cleansing, lighting and watching the streets. The spa was not as successful as had been hoped, due in part to the popularity of the waters at nearby Bath.

== Buildings and structures ==
There are two Grade II* listed structures in the parish: St Michael&#x27;s Church and one of the chest tombs in its churchyard.

Pevsner wrote that &quot;the only rewarding part of Melksham is by the church&quot;. Melksham House, south of the church, is early 18th century but largely rebuilt after a 1920 fire and adapted for use as a sports and social club. Southwest of the church, a 15th-century tithe barn was remodelled into a school by G. E. Street in 1878; the school left the premises in 1973 and the building is now residential.

The area around Canon Square, north of the church, has several Grade II listed houses and cottages, among them a former vicarage dating from the late 17th century, remodelled in 1877 by Street and now divided into two residences. There is also a small two-storey roundhouse, built in the late 18th century for the wool industry.

The town&#x27;s four-span bridge over the Avon is from the late 18th century.

== Religious sites ==

A church was recorded at Melksham in the Domesday Book of 1086. The parish church of St Michael and All Angels has 12th-century origins, and was enlarged in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries; in 1845 it was restored by T. H. Wyatt and is now a Grade II* listed building. As the town expanded, in 1876 St Andrew&#x27;s church was built in Early English style to serve the Forest area to the northeast of the town.

A Baptist chapel was erected at Old Broughton Road in 1714, and replaced with a larger building on the same site in 1776 which was enlarged in 1839. In 1850 there were 165 members, and 340 children attended the Sunday School. In 1909, school buildings were completed on land in front of the chapel.
Ebenezer Baptist Church, Union Street, was built in 1835 by Particular Baptists. A Methodist chapel was built on the High Street in 1872, its two-storey front having four large Corinthian columns and a cornice with oculus. This became the United Church after the union of the Methodists and Congregationalists in 1976, and the Congregational church off the Market Place closed.

A Catholic church, St Anthony of Padua, was built in pale brick to the south of the town centre and opened in 1939. An independent congregation built Queensway Chapel in the eastern suburbs in 1967.

Melksham has a long history of Quakerism, beginning with meetings nearby at Shaw in the 17th century. A meeting-house was built in 1698 at what is now King Street, and rebuilt on the same site around 1777 (or 1734). Quakerism declined in the 19th century but the Melksham meeting continued until 1950. The meeting-house was sold in 1958 and was used as a Spiritualist church for a time; in 2015 the building was restored and converted into offices.

==Governance==

Until 1974 the town was managed by Melksham Urban District Council, based at Melksham Town Hall. It was then managed by West Wiltshire District Council, but since the abolition of West Wiltshire in 2009, the most significant local government functions (including schools, roads, social services, recycling, emergency planning, leisure services, housing, development control and waste disposal) have been carried out by Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority.

Melksham civil parish is divided into four electoral divisions, each electing one member to Wiltshire Council. These are Melksham Forest, Melksham East, Melksham South, and Melksham Without North &amp; Shurnold; the latter extends north beyond the parish to include Whitley, Shaw and Beanacre.

The civil parish has a town council, with fifteen members elected by four wards: East, Forest, North and South. The councillors elect one of their number as Mayor of Melksham for a one-year term. As well as having a consultative role, the town council runs the Assembly Hall events venue. Since 2019–2020 it is responsible for the town&#x27;s play areas and King George V playing field, after transfer of ownership from Wiltshire Council.

The outskirts of Melksham, and most of the surrounding rural communities, are administered by another parish council, Melksham Without.

For Westminster elections, Melksham is part of the Melksham and Devizes constituency, which was created following a boundary review and first contested at the 2024 general election, when it was won by Brian Mathew for the Liberal Democrats.

==Geography==

The civil parish of Melksham includes Melksham Forest, formerly a separate settlement to the northeast and now a suburb of the town. It has an Anglican church (St Andrew&#x27;s, 1876) and had a Methodist chapel (1905 to before 2010).

The parish of Melksham Without includes several villages and suburbs of Melksham:
*Bowerhill, a large residential community generally considered as separate from Melksham, with a large industrial area
*Hunter&#x27;s Meadow, a 2020s development north of Bowerhill
*Berryfield, a village south of and adjacent to Melksham, often considered part of the town
*Beanacre, a village to the north, again often considered as a northern suburb of the town.

== Demography ==
In the 19th century, the population of Melksham parish increased from 4,000 at the 1801 census to 5,800 in 1851, then declined to 2,100 in 1891. Numbers increased slowly in the first half of the 20th century and more rapidly in the second half, rising to 14,204 by 2001. The 2011 census saw a modest increase to 14,677.

The wider built-up area – which includes Berryfield and Bowerhill, both in Melksham Without parish – had a population of 19,357 at the 2011 census.

==Economy==

The &quot;Shell Guide to Wiltshire&quot;, published in 1968, characterised the town as &quot;with the exception of Swindon the most industrialized in the county&quot;. Today, Melksham has varied industries including Avon Rubber, which previously owned the Avon Tyre plant on a riverside site in the town centre. The plant became the home of Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber (a subsidiary of the American Goodyear company) and was a major employer in the town, producing &quot;Cooper Avon&quot; and &quot;Avon Tyres&quot; brands until the site closed at the end of 2023. In 2000, Avon Rubber moved to a large purpose-built facility to the south of the town near Semington, employing over 300 on products such as gasmasks.

Also to the south of the town, an area of light industry at Bowerhill is partly on the site of the former RAF Melksham training schools. Modern buildings here include regional headquarters designed by Sir Nicholas Grimshaw for the American office furniture maker Herman Miller, and the UK headquarters of Knorr-Bremse, designer and manufacturer of railway braking systems.

Melksham has a number of pharmacies, high street clothes shops, charity shops and privately run individual stores. It has five supermarkets: Asda, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Waitrose, Lidl and Aldi.

==Culture and community==
Melksham has an Assembly Hall and the Rachel Fowler Centre, while many of the surrounding villages have community halls which offer a wide variety of activities. Melksham Oak Community School offers a variety of sporting and cultural facilities to the community of Melksham.

The town has an annual &#x27;Party in the Park&#x27; which usually takes place in July. It includes a fair with rides and amusements, a fireworks display, a stage hosting musical and dance acts and a carnival parade through the town with floats promoting local businesses and clubs and raising money for charity.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Melksham Independent News is the town&#x27;s family-owned independent newspaper, established in 1981. Over 13,700 copies of the paper are distributed across the town and surrounding villages biweekly. The town is also served by the regional newspapers, Gazette and Herald and Wiltshire Times.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wiltshire on 104.3 FM, Heart West on 102.2 FM, and Greatest Hits Radio South West on 107.5 FM.

==Sport and leisure==
Melksham Community Campus, built by Wiltshire Council on a central site next to Melksham House, opened in 2022. It provides a swimming pool, library, sports centre and council offices.

Melksham has a non-League football club, Melksham Town F.C., who play at the Oakfield Stadium on Eastern Way, which opened in January 2017. In 2018 the club won promotion from the Western League to the Southern League. Melksham Rugby Union Club also play at the Oakfields complex, on separate pitches.

The Wiltshire School of Gymnastics is at Bowerhill. Melksham has a cricket club who play their home matches at the Melksham House ground. The club has both youth and adult teams; in the 2019 season their Saturday side competed in Division 4 of the Wiltshire County Cricket League following promotion in 2018.

==Transport==

Melksham railway station, on the branch of the Wessex Main Line from Chippenham to Trowbridge, has services roughly every two hours in each direction on weekdays. Trains are operated by Great Western Railway, with services marketed as the &#x27;TransWilts line&#x27; between Westbury and Swindon.

Melksham is served by bus companies including Faresaver and First West of England.

The town is on the north–south A350 primary route from the M4 motorway (Junction 17, near Chippenham) to Poole on the south coast. In February 2020, the central government gave approval for a £125m re-routing of the A350 to the east of Melksham.

Stonar School, an all-ages independent day and boarding school, is nearby at Atworth.

==Dinosaur==
Melksham is the namesake for a prehistoric crocodile species discovered in the town. &quot;Ieldraan melkshamensis&quot;, or the Melksham Monster, was 10 ft long and was an apex predator in the waters around the UK during the Jurassic period. The fossil had been in the possession of the Natural History Museum since 1875, until a team from the University of Edinburgh led by Davide Foffa classified it in 2017 as a distinct species.

<text>Ebernoe Horn Fair is held in the small Sussex village of Ebernoe, the location of which is about five miles north of Petworth (). The fair is held annually on Saint James&#x27;s Day, 25 July. The tradition is centuries old though it appears to have been revived in 1864 after a long lapse. The celebration is held on the village common and the main attraction is a cricket match between Ebernoe and a nearby village. Towards the end of the day the highest scoring batsman is presented with a set of horns. These are taken from a sheep which has been roasted during the day. It is thought the presentation of horns is associated with the custom of dressing up with horns as a symbol of cuckoldry (a cuckold is an old English term for a man whose wife has had an adulterous affair. It relates to the cuckoo, a bird which lays its eggs in another bird&#x27;s nest). Centuries ago horn fairs were boisterous events where cuckoldry and seduction would not be unknown. The practice of dressing up with horns is alluded to in the traditional Horn Fair Song. The old saying &quot;All&#x27;s fair at Horn Fair&quot; probably originates from such events. In days gone by it seems that Ebernoe Fair was often beset by thunderstorms. However, the storms were taken as a good luck sign and farmers would look forward to a good harvest. The absence of a storm would suggest the crops would fail. Ebernoe Horn Fair was also the day on which gardeners were reminded to sow their spring cabbages.

There was no fair in 1915–18, 1940–45 and 2020.

==Horn Fair song==
As I was a-walking one fine summer morn,

So soft was the wind and the waves on the corn.

I met a pretty damsel upon a grey mare,

And she was a-riding upon a grey mare.

&quot;Now take me up behind you fair maid for to ride&quot;,

&quot;Oh no and then, Oh no, for my mammy she would chide,

And then my dear old daddy would beat me full sore,

And never let me ride on his grey mare no more.&quot;

&quot;If you would see Horn Fair you must walk on your way,

I will not let you ride on my grey mare today,

You&#x27;d rumple all my muslin and uncurl my hair,

And leave me all distrest to be seen at Horn Fair.&quot;

&quot;O fairest of damsels, how can you say No?

With you I do intend to Horn Fair for to go,

We&#x27;ll join the best of company when we do get there,

With horns on their heads, boys, the finest at the Fair.

They are the finest horns you did ever behold,

They are the finest horns and are gilded with gold.

So merrily, right merrily, to Horn Fair we did go,

A jolly brisk couple boys, and all in a row.&quot;

This song also seems to have been used at a Horn Fair at Charlton in Kent which, after a history dating at least from the 16th century, died out in 1872. In 1951 Mr Morrish of Great Allfields Farm, Balls Cross reintroduced the song. Mr Tom Stemp, then aged 75, said he could well remember it being sung by an old Ebernoe woodman, David Baker, who died in 1943 at the age of eighty. The folk duo Spiers and Boden also sing this version of the song.

<text>A country club is a privately-owned club, often with a membership quota and admittance by invitation or sponsorship, that generally offers both a variety of recreational sports and facilities for dining and entertaining. Typical athletic offerings are golf, tennis, and swimming. Where golf is the principal or sole sporting activity, and especially outside of the United States and Canada, it is common for a country club to be referred to simply as a golf club. Many country clubs offer other new activities such as pickleball, and platform tennis.

Country clubs are most commonly located in city outskirts or suburbs, because of the need for substantial grounds for outdoor activities. This factor distinguishes them from an urban athletic club.

Country clubs originated in Scotland and first appeared in the US in the early 1880s. Country clubs had a profound effect on expanding suburbanization and are considered to be the precursor to gated community development.

== By nation ==

=== United States and Canada === 
Country clubs can be exclusive organizations. In small towns, membership in the country club is often not as exclusive or expensive as in larger cities where there is competition for a limited number of memberships. In addition to the fees, some clubs have additional requirements to join. For example, membership can be limited to those who reside in a particular housing community. Early clubs focused primarily on equestrian-related sports: coaching, racing, jumping, polo, and foxhunting. In the 1980s, the nationwide interest shifted more towards golf.

Country clubs were founded by upper-class elites between 1880 and 1930. The Brookline Country Club was founded in 1882 and is esteemed to be the nation’s first by the &quot;Encyclopaedia of American Urban History&quot;. By 1907, country clubs were claimed to be “the very essence of American upper-class.” The number of country clubs increased greatly with industrialization, the rise in incomes, and suburbanization in the 1920s. During the 1920s, country clubs acted as community social centers. When people lost most of their income and net worth during the Great Depression, the number of country clubs decreased drastically for lack of membership funding.

Historically, many country clubs were &quot;restricted&quot; and refused to admit members of specific racial, ethnic or religious groups such as Jews, African Americans and Catholics. Beginning in the 1960s civil rights lawsuits forced clubs to drop exclusionary policies. In a 1990 landmark ruling at Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club, the PGA refused to hold tournaments at private clubs that practiced racial discrimination. This new regulation led to the admittance of black people at private clubs. The incident at Shoal Creek is comparable to the 1966 NCAA basketball tournament, which led to the end of racial discrimination in college basketball.

The Philadelphia Cricket Club is the oldest organized country club in the United States devoted to playing games, while The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts is the oldest club devoted to golf.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, many country clubs are smaller than those in the USA though examples similar in size and scope to the American country club also exist. Gentlemen’s clubs in Britain—many of which admit women while remaining socially exclusive—fill many roles of the United States&#x27; country clubs.

===Spain===

Similar to the United States, Spain has had a tradition of country clubs as a pillar of social life. This began during the reign of Alfonso XII and was consolidated during the reign of his son and successor Alfonso XIII, who granted royal status to a handful of country clubs. Most country clubs in Spain are typically associated with the upper classes, and were conceived around a central sport such as golf, polo or tennis, although some of them did eventually offer other sports. Examples include Real Club de la Puerta de Hierro, Club de Campo Villa de Madrid, Real Club de Polo de Barcelona, Real Sociedad de Golf de Neguri, Real Club Pineda etc. Many of them are also located in those cities or towns that hosted the summer vacations of the royal family. Such is the case of Real Sociedad de Tenis de la Magdalena, Real Golf de Pedreña or Real Golf Club de Zarauz for example. The most notable difference between Spanish and American country clubs is that the former are not normally located in the countryside but either within a city or town itself or in the outskirts at most.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
Many of the gentlemen&#x27;s clubs established during the British Raj are still active in major cities, for example the Bangalore Club, Lahore Gymkhana, Karachi Gymkhana, Nizam Club, and Bengal Club.

Gymkhanas are sporting or social clubs across the subcontinent.

=== Australia ===
 Country clubs exist in multiple forms, including athletic-based clubs and golf clubs. Examples are the Breakfast Point Country Club, Cumberland Grove Country Club and Terrey Hills Golf &amp; Country Club in Sydney, the Castle Hill Country Club, the Gold Coast Polo &amp; Country Club, The Heritage Golf and Country Club, Elanora Country Club, and the Sanctuary Cove Golf &amp; Country Club.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, almost all golf clubs are called &quot;Country Clubs&quot; by their owners.

<doc id="867975" wikidata="Q338613" url="?curid=867975" title="Aeolipile">
<text>An aeolipile, aeolipyle, or eolipile, from the Greek &quot;Αἰόλου πύλη,&quot; , also known as a Hero&#x27;s (or Heron&#x27;s) engine, is a simple, bladeless radial steam turbine which spins when the central water container is heated. Torque is produced by steam jets exiting the turbine. The Greek-Egyptian mathematician and engineer Hero of Alexandria described the device in the 1st century AD, and many sources give him the credit for its invention. However, Vitruvius was the first to describe this appliance in his &quot;De architectura&quot; ().

The aeolipile is considered to be the first recorded steam engine or reaction steam turbine, but it is neither a practical source of power nor a direct predecessor of the type of steam engine invented during the Industrial Revolution.

The name – derived from the Greek word Αἴολος and Latin word &quot;pila&quot; – translates to &quot;the ball of Aeolus&quot;, Aeolus being the Greek god of the air and wind.

Because it applies steam to perform work, an Aeolipile (depicted in profile) is used as the symbol for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Boiler Technician Rate, as it was for the earlier Watertender, Boilermaker, and Boilerman ratings.

==Physics==

The aeolipile usually consists of a spherical or cylindrical vessel with oppositely bent or curved nozzles projecting outwards. It is designed to rotate on its axis. When the vessel is pressurised with steam, the gas is expelled out of the nozzles, which generates thrust due to the rocket principle as a consequence of the 2nd and 3rd of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. When the nozzles, pointing in different directions, produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the bearings, the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment (mechanical couple), or torque, causing the vessel to spin about its axis. Aerodynamic drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed (rpm) and consume the accelerating torque, eventually cancelling it and achieving a steady state speed.

Typically, and as Hero described the device, the water is heated in a simple boiler which forms part of a stand for the rotating vessel. Where this is the case, the boiler is connected to the rotating chamber by a pair of pipes that also serve as the s for the chamber. Alternatively the rotating chamber may itself serve as the boiler, and this arrangement greatly simplifies the pivot/bearing arrangements, as they then do not need to pass steam. This can be seen in the illustration of a classroom model shown here.

==History==

Both Hero and Vitruvius draw on the much earlier work by Ctesibius (285–222 BC), also known as Ktēsíbios or Tesibius, who was an inventor and mathematician in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt. He wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps.

===Vitruvius&#x27;s description===
Vitruvius (c. 80 BC – c. 15 BC) mentions aeolipiles by name:

===Hero&#x27;s description===
Hero (c. 10–70 AD) takes a more practical approach, in that he gives instructions how to make one:

==Practical usage==

It is not known whether the aeolipile was put to any practical use in ancient times, and if it was seen as a pragmatic device, a whimsical novelty, an object of reverence, or some other thing. A source described it as a mere curiosity for the ancient Greeks, or a &quot;party trick&quot;. Hero&#x27;s drawing shows a standalone device, and was presumably intended as a &quot;temple wonder&quot;, like many of the other devices described in &quot;Pneumatica&quot;.

Vitruvius, on the other hand, mentions use of the aeolipile for demonstrating the physical properties of the weather. He describes them as:

After describing the device&#x27;s construction (see above) he concludes:
In 1543, Blasco de Garay, a scientist and a captain in the Spanish navy, allegedly demonstrated before the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V and a committee of high officials an invention he claimed could propel large ships in the absence of wind using an apparatus consisted of copper boiler and moving wheels on either side of the ship. This account was preserved by the royal Spanish archives at Simancas. It is proposed that de Garay used Hero&#x27;s aeolipile and combined it with the technology used in Roman boats and late medieval galleys. Here, de Garay&#x27;s invention introduced an innovation where the aeolipile had practical usage, which was to generate motion to the paddlewheels, demonstrating the feasibility of steam-driven boats. This claim was denied by Spanish authorities.

<doc id="867979" wikidata="Q1030234" url="?curid=867979" title="Anti-authoritarianism">
<text>Anti-authoritarianism is opposition to authoritarianism. Anti-authoritarians usually believe in full equality before the law and strong civil liberties. Sometimes the term is used interchangeably with anarchism, an ideology which entails opposing authority or hierarchical organization in the conduct of human relations, including the state system.

== Views and practice ==
After World War II, there was a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on anti-fascism in Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from occupation and to fears arising from the development of superpowers. Anti-authoritarianism has also been associated with countercultural and bohemian movements. In the 1950s, the Beat Generation were politically radical and to some degree their anti-authoritarian attitudes were taken up by activists in the 1960s. In the 1970s, anti-authoritarianism became associated with the punk subculture.

<text>The LynxOS RTOS is a Unix-like real-time operating system from Lynx Software Technologies (formerly &quot;LynuxWorks&quot;). Sometimes known as the Lynx Operating System, LynxOS features full POSIX conformance and, more recently, Linux compatibility. LynxOS is mostly used in real-time embedded systems, in applications for avionics, aerospace, the military, industrial process control and telecommunications.

== History ==
The first versions of LynxOS were written in 1986 in Dallas, Texas, by Mitchell Bunnell and targeted at a custom-built Motorola 68010-based computer. The first platform LynxOS ran on was an Atari 1040ST with cross development done on an Integrated Solutions UNIX machine. In 1988-1989, LynxOS was ported to the Intel 80386 architecture. Around 1989, application binary interface (ABI) compatibility with UNIX System V.3 was added. Compatibility with other operating systems, including Linux, followed.

Full Memory Management Unit support has been included in the kernel since 1989, for the reliability of protected memory and the performance advantages of virtual addresses. The PowerPC architecture is also supported, and in February 2015 Lynx announced planned support for the ARM Cortex A-family.

LynxOS components are designed for absolute determinism (hard real-time performance), which means that they respond within a known period of time. Predictable response times are ensured even in the presence of heavy input/output (I/O) due to the kernel&#x27;s unique threading model, which allows interrupt routines to be very short and fast.

Lynx holds an expired patent on the technology that LynxOS uses to maintain hard real-time performance. was granted to Lynx November 21, 1995: &quot;Operating System Architecture using Multiple Priority Light Weight kernel Task-based Interrupt Handling.&quot;

In 2003, Lynx introduced a specialized version of LynxOS named LynxOS-178, especially for use in avionics applications that require certification to industry standards such as DO-178B.

In late 2022, support for the programming language Rust was added to the certified toolchain for LynxOS-178 and LynxElement unikernel.

The Usenet newsgroup is devoted to discussion of LynxOS.

<text>Narrator is a screen reader in Microsoft Windows. Developed by Professor Paul Blenkhorn in 2000, the utility made the Windows operating system more accessible for blind and visually impaired users.

==Overview==
Narrator is included with every copy of Microsoft Windows, providing a measure of access to Windows without the need to install additional software as long as the computer in use includes a sound card and speakers or headphones. Windows 2000 was the first Microsoft operating system released with some degree of accessibility for the blind built in, permitting a blind person to walk up to any such computer and make some use of it immediately.

The Windows 2000 version of Narrator uses SAPI 4 and allows the use of other SAPI 4 voices. The Windows XP version uses the newer SAPI 5. However, it only allows the use of the default voice, Microsoft Sam, even if other voices have been installed.

In Windows Vista and Windows 7, Narrator has been updated to use SAPI 5.3 and the Microsoft Anna voice for English. In Windows Ultimate and Windows editions for China, the Microsoft Lili voice for Mandarin Chinese is included.

In Windows 10, Narrator is available in English (United States, United Kingdom, and India), French, Italian, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin (Chinese Simplified and Chinese Traditional), Cantonese (Chinese Traditional), Spanish (Spain and Mexico), Polish, Russian, and Portuguese (Brazil).

A version of Narrator is also included in all Windows Phones, though with far fewer settings than the Narrator for the desktop. Narrator for Windows Phones previously only worked if the phone&#x27;s language is set to &quot;English (United States)&quot;.

There are numerous voices included in the narrator pack, such as Microsoft David, Microsoft Zira, Microsoft Mark, and in earlier editions, Microsoft Hazel.

In Windows 11, the Narrator app was redesigned and new natural voices were added. The app is available in both Dark and Contrast Themes.

<doc id="867986" wikidata="Q262660" url="?curid=867986" title="Kevin Carter">
<text>Kevin Carter (13 September 1960 – 27 July 1994) was a South African photojournalist and member of the Bang-Bang Club. He was the recipient in 1994 of a Pulitzer Prize for his photograph depicting the 1993 famine in Sudan; he died by suicide four months after at the age of 33. His story is depicted in the book &quot;The Bang-Bang Club&quot;, written by Greg Marinovich and João Silva and published in 2000.

== Early life ==
Kevin Carter was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and grew up in a middle-class neighbourhood. As a child, he occasionally saw police raids to arrest black people who were illegally living in the area. He said later that he questioned how his parents, a Catholic, &quot;liberal&quot; family, could be what he described as &quot;lackadaisical&quot; about fighting against apartheid.

After high school, Carter dropped out of his studies to become a pharmacist and was drafted into the army. To escape from the infantry, he enlisted in the Air Force in which he served four years. In 1980, he witnessed a black mess-hall waiter being insulted. Carter defended the man, resulting in him being badly beaten by the other servicemen. He then went absent without leave, attempting to start a new life as a radio disc-jockey named &quot;David&quot;. This, however, proved more difficult than he had anticipated. Soon after, he decided to serve out the rest of his required military service. After witnessing the Church Street bombing in Pretoria in 1983, he decided to become a news photographer and journalist.

== Early work ==
After completing his military service, in 1983 Carter returned to Johannesburg and took a job in a photographic supply store. This is how he met local photojournalists and received his first commission. He partnered with the &quot;Johannesburg Sunday Express&quot; and became a weekend sports photographer. He took photos at Saturday and Sunday matches. In 1984, he moved on to work for the &quot;Johannesburg Star&quot;, exposing the brutality of apartheid.

Carter was the first to photograph a public &quot;necklacing&quot; execution by black Africans in South Africa in the mid-1980s. Carter later spoke of the images: &quot;I was appalled at what they were doing. But then people started talking about those pictures... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn&#x27;t been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn&#x27;t necessarily such a bad thing to do.&quot;

== In Sudan ==
In March 1993, Robert Hadley of the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan offered João Silva the opportunity to travel to Sudan and report about the famine in South Sudan embedding with the rebels in that area&#x27;s civil war. Silva told Carter, who felt it was an opportunity to expand his freelance career and use work as a way to address personal problems. Operation Lifeline Sudan had been having funding difficulties, and the UN believed that publicising the area&#x27;s famine and needs would help aid organisations sustain funding. Silva and Carter were apolitical and desiring only to photograph.

After flying to Nairobi, the two found out that new fighting in Sudan would force them to wait in that city indefinitely. During this time, Carter made a day trip with the UN to Juba in the south Sudan to photograph a barge with food aid for the region. Soon afterwards, the UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Hadley invited Silva and Carter to fly there with him. Once in Ayod, Silva and Carter separated to shoot photos of famine victims, discussing between themselves the shocking situations they were witnessing. Silva found rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority. Carter joined him. One of the soldiers, who did not speak English, was interested in Carter&#x27;s wristwatch. Carter gave him the cheap watch as a gift. The soldiers served as their bodyguards.

=== Pulitzer Prize photograph in Sudan===
Carter shot an image of a child who appeared to be a little girl, fallen to the ground from hunger, while a vulture lurked on the ground nearby. He told Silva he was shocked by the situation he had just photographed, and had chased the vulture away. A few minutes later, Carter and Silva boarded a small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.

Sold to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the photograph first appeared on 26 March 1993, and syndicated worldwide. Hundreds of people contacted the newspaper to ask the fate of the girl. The paper said that according to Carter, &quot;she recovered enough to resume her trek after the vulture was chased away&quot; but that it was unknown whether she reached the UN food center. In April 1994, the photograph won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography.

In 2011, the child&#x27;s father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of &quot;fevers&quot;, according to his family.

The photo, and its associated moral and political implications, have appeared in sociological academic journals.

== Other work ==
In March 1994, Carter took a photograph of the three Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging members being shot during their abortive invasion of Bophuthatswana just before the South African election. Carter ran out of film halfway through the incident. Eamonn McCabe of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said: &quot;It was a picture that made nearly every front page in the world, the one real photograph of the whole campaign.&quot;

== Death ==
Four months after being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography, Carter died of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on 27 July 1994 at the age of 33. Desmond Tutu, Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, South Africa, wrote of Carter, &quot;And we know a little about the cost of being traumatized that drove some to suicide, that, yes, these people were human beings operating under the most demanding of conditions.&quot;

Carter&#x27;s suicide note read:

The final line is a reference to his recently deceased colleague Ken Oosterbroek.

==In popular culture==
The 1996 song &quot;Kevin Carter&quot; by rock band Manic Street Preachers, from their fourth album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;, was inspired by Carter&#x27;s life and suicide. The lyrics were written by Richey Edwards shortly before his own disappearance.

A main character in the book &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, Will Navidson, is a photojournalist who is tormented by guilt over winning a Pulitzer Prize for a photo of a starving Sudanese girl but not helping her. In Footnote 336 it is mentioned that this is &quot;clearly based on Kevin Carter&#x27;s [...] photograph&quot;.

The 2001 album &quot;Poets and Madmen&quot;, by American heavy metal band Savatage, is inspired by the life and death of Carter.

<doc id="867987" wikidata="Q1067217" url="?curid=867987" title="Phreatic eruption">
<text>A phreatic eruption, also called a phreatic explosion, ultravulcanian eruption or steam-blast eruption, occurs when magma heats ground water or surface water. The extreme temperature of the magma (anywhere from ) causes near-instantaneous evaporation of water to steam, resulting in an explosion of steam, water, ash, rock, and volcanic bombs. At Mount St. Helens in Washington state, hundreds of steam explosions preceded the 1980 Plinian eruption of the volcano. A less intense geothermal event may result in a mud volcano. 

Phreatic eruptions typically include steam and rock fragments; the inclusion of liquid lava is unusual. The temperature of the fragments can range from cold to incandescent. If molten magma is included, volcanologists classify the event as a phreatomagmatic eruption. These eruptions occasionally create broad, low-relief craters called &quot;maars&quot;. Phreatic explosions can be accompanied by carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide gas-emissions. Carbon dioxide can asphyxiate at sufficient concentration; hydrogen sulfide acts as a broad-spectrum poison. A 1979 phreatic eruption on the island of Java killed 140 people, most of whom were overcome by poisonous gases.

==Examples of phreatic eruptions==

* Cumbre Vieja - In the 2021 La Palma eruption, new eruptive vents tended to announce themselves with a phreatic explosion, followed soon after by the opening of a new fissure vent in the same location.
* Krakatoa – Indonesia, 1883 (see 1883 eruption of Krakatoa) – it is believed that the eruption, which obliterated most of the volcanic island and created the loudest sound in recorded history, was a phreatomagmatic event.
*Ritter Island – Papua New Guinea, 1888 (see 1888 Ritter Island eruption and tsunami) – Resulted in the largest lateral spreading of a volcanic cone in human history.
* Kilauea – Hawaii, United States – the volcano has a long record of phreatic explosions; a 1924 phreatic eruption hurled rocks estimated at eight tons up to a distance of one kilometer.
* Surtsey – Iceland, 1963–65
* Taal Volcano – Philippines, 1965, 1977, 2020
* Mount Ontake – Japan, 2014 (see 2014 Mount Ontake eruption)
* Mayon Volcano – Philippines, 2013
* Whakaari/White Island – New Zealand, 2019 (see 2019 Whakaari/White Island eruption)
* Mount Bulusan – Philippines, 2022

<doc id="868002" wikidata="Q622554" url="?curid=868002" title="The Summons (Grisham novel)">
<text>The Summons is a legal thriller novel written by American author [[John Grisham]], first published in February 2002. Known for his courtroom dramas, Grisham once again explores the legal world in this novel, though with a significant departure into family dynamics and mystery.

==Plot summary==

The main character, Ray Atlee, is a law professor with a good salary at the University of Virginia. He has a brother, Forrest, and a father, known to many as Judge Reuben V. Atlee. Ray is sent to his father&#x27;s house in Clanton, Mississippi, to discuss issues regarding the old man&#x27;s will and estate. To do this, Ray has to go to fictional Ford County, Mississippi, the setting for four of John Grisham&#x27;s other books including &quot;A Time To Kill&quot;. When he finds his father dead in the study, Ray discovers a sum of over $3 million in the house, money which is not part of Judge Atlee&#x27;s will. Ray immediately thinks the money is &quot;dirty&quot; because his father could not possibly have made so much money in his career.

Assuming that he is the only one who knows about the money, Ray decides to take it without making it officially part of the estate, and does not tell anyone about it: he knows that if he made it a part of the estate, taxes would take most of the money. But later reality proves otherwise. Ray is being followed; someone else knows about the money. After his own investigations into the roots of the money and the identity of his shadow—including trips to casinos and shady meetings with prominent southern lawyers—he eventually discovers that Forrest has the money. He finds Forrest in a drug rehab compound and confronts him. At the end both part, with Forrest telling Ray that he will contact him in a year. 

=== Themes ===
The novel explores themes of family tension, moral dilemmas, and the gray areas of legality and ethics. The central mystery of the unexplained money leads Ray to question not only his father&#x27;s integrity but also his own as he struggles with the decision of what to do with the fortune.

=== Critical Reception ===
While &quot;The Summons&quot; follows in the tradition of Grisham&#x27;s legal thrillers, it has been noted for its focus on personal relationships and internal conflict rather than courtroom drama. Critics have praised Grisham&#x27;s storytelling and his ability to create suspense, though some have commented that the resolution leaves several unanswered questions about the characters&#x27; futures.

<doc id="868004" wikidata="Q271117" url="?curid=868004" title="Andrea Jung">
<text>Andrea Jung (; born September 18, 1958) is a Canadian-American executive, non-profit leader, and prominent women&#x27;s-issues supporter based in New York City. In April 2014, she became president and CEO of Grameen America, a nonprofit microfinance organization founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner, Muhammad Yunus. From 1999 until 2012, she served as the first female CEO and chairman of Avon Products, Inc., a multi-level marketing company. Jung was also the first woman to serve as Chairman of the Cosmetic, Toiletry &amp; Fragrance Association, and Chairman of the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations.

Jung received the 2010 Clinton Global Citizen Award for her leadership of the Avon Foundation for Women and other public-private partnerships to end violence against women and to stem the breast cancer epidemic. Under her leadership, the Avon Foundation for Women raised and awarded nearly US$1 billion to support health and empowerment causes, becoming the largest women-focused corporate philanthropy around the world.

After resigning her CEO role at Avon, Jung continued as chair of Avon&#x27;s board of directors through the end of 2012 and then as a senior advisor to Avon&#x27;s board through April 2014.

== Early life ==
Jung was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1958 and raised in Wellesley, Massachusetts. As a child, she studied the piano and took lessons in Mandarin on Saturday mornings.

Her mother is a Shanghai-born amateur pianist. Jung&#x27;s father is a Hong Kong-born retired architect, formerly a partner at TRO Jung Brannen, who also taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jung graduated magna cum laude with an A.B. in English from Princeton University in 1979 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;The Fiction of Katherine Mansfield: Reconciliation of Duality.&quot; She is fluent in Mandarin. Her brother, Mark Jung, also graduated from Princeton University and went on to become co-founder and CEO of IGN which he continued to run after its acquisition by NewsCorp.
== Career ==
Jung was executive vice president of Neiman Marcus, responsible for all of women&#x27;s apparel, accessories, and cosmetics. Before that, she was senior vice president, general merchandising manager, for I. Magnin.

Jung joined Avon Products, Inc. in 1994 as the company&#x27;s president in its product marketing group. She became president of global marketing in 1996 and executive vice president/president of global marketing and new business in 1997. Her responsibilities at that time centered primarily around market research, joint ventures and strategic planning. She then became president and chief operating officer, with responsibility for all business units of Avon worldwide. She has been on the company&#x27;s board of directors since 1998. In November 1999, Jung was promoted to chairman of the board and chief executive officer.

In December 2011, Avon announced that it had initiated a search for a new chief executive with Jung helping to choose her replacement and continuing as chairman of the board for the next two years. Avon faced several controversies at the time of her resignation. The company&#x27;s stock had dropped 45 percent in 2011. Avon&#x27;s third quarter earnings report stated that sales targets would be unattainable and disclosed that there were two ongoing SEC inquiries. Net income in the third quarter fell to $164.2 million, or 38 cents a share (below analysts&#x27; estimates of 46 cents a share), from $166.7 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier. The results marked the fourth time in five-quarters that profit trailed analysts&#x27; projections. There was also a three-year probe into an alleged bribery of foreign officials has already caused the dismissal of four Avon executives.

Jung was named one of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most powerful women in 2004. In 2009, Forbes ranked her the 25th most powerful woman. In 2012, she was named in the list of the worst 5 CEOs of 2012 by Bloomberg Businessweek.

In 2014, Andrea Jung became president and chief executive officer of a non-profit organization, Grameen America. This organization, founded by Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist, &quot;provided assistance, often in the form of microloans, to women looking to start small businesses.&quot;

<text>George Gerald Reisman (; born January 13, 1937) is an American economist. He is Professor Emeritus of Economics at Pepperdine University and the author of &quot;The Government Against the Economy&quot; (1979), which was praised by both F. A. Hayek and Henry Hazlitt, and &quot;Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics&quot; (1996). He is known as an advocate of free market or &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism.

==Biography==
Reisman was born in New York City and graduated from Columbia College in 1957. As a sophomore in 1954, he was a supporter of Sen. Joseph McCarthy and spoke at a testimonial dinner to McCarthy&#x27;s chief aide, Roy Cohn, following the latter&#x27;s resignation. At the dinner, according to Time magazine, Reisman, representing the Students for America, called Cohn &quot;the American Dreyfus,&quot; adding: &quot;Roy Cohn and Joe McCarthy will be redeemed when the people have taken back their government from the criminal alliance of Communists, Socialists, New Dealers and the Eisenhower-Dewey Republicans.&quot;

He earned his PhD from New York University under the direction of Ludwig von Mises, whose methodological work &quot;The Epistemological Problems of Economics&quot; Reisman translated from the German original to English.

In the 1980s, with his wife, psychologist Edith Packer, he organized the Jefferson School of Philosophy, Economics, and Psychology, which held several conferences and seminars, the first being held at University of California, San Diego. Its lecturers included Leonard Peikoff, Edward Teller, Petr Beckmann, Hans Sennholz, Bernard Siegan, Anne Wortham, Robert Hessen, Allan Gotthelf, David Kelley, John Ridpath, Harry Binswanger, Edwin Locke, Walter E. Williams, Mary Ann Sures, Andrew Bernstein and Peter Schwartz. Attendees of these conferences include later Objectivist writers Tara Smith and Lindsay Perigo.

Reisman was a student of Ayn Rand, whose influence on his thought and work he described as being as great as that of his mentor, Mises.

<text>Linda Lee Thomas (November 17, 1883 – May 20, 1954) was an American socialite and the wife of musical theatre composer Cole Porter.

==First marriage==
She was born Linda Belle Lee to the prominent Lee family of Virginia. Her father was Louisville banker William Paca Lee and her mother Lily Lee (née Hill). Friends introduced her to Edward Russell Thomas, a son of Union Army general Samuel Thomas and owner of the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot; (and who later became the first American to kill someone in a car accident) . They married on June 29, 1901, at Newport, Rhode Island. She was 17. They lived a life of luxury, with houses in Palm Beach, Manhattan, and Newport. It was said that her favorite &quot;department store&quot; was Van Cleef &amp; Arpels. They divorced on October 26, 1912, reportedly due to his abuse.

==Marriage to Porter==
Thomas and Cole Porter met on January 30, 1918, at the wedding of Henry Potter Russell to heiress Ethel Borden Harriman, daughter of railroad and investment banking tycoon J. Borden Harriman and his wife, née Florence &quot;Daisy&quot; Hurst, at the Hôtel Ritz Paris.

Linda and Cole were married on December 18, 1919, in the city hall of the 8ème arrondissement of Paris.

From 1930 to 1939, the Porters lived at 13 rue Monsieur, a house next door to Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and with a garden adjoining the future residence of Nancy Mitford. They were married 34 years, and although they had no children born of their marriage, Linda conceived and miscarried.

Linda died from emphysema in 1954, aged 70, in the couple&#x27;s apartment in the Waldorf Towers. She left an estate of over $1.5 million (over $ million today) in which Cole inherited a lifetime interest. Her jewelry collection included pieces by Paul Flato. She was buried in the Porter family plot at Mount Hope Cemetery in Peru, Indiana.

==Portrayals==
Thomas is portrayed by Alexis Smith in the 1946 film &quot;Night and Day&quot; and by Ashley Judd in the 2004 film &quot;De-Lovely&quot;. A one-woman show about her life with Porter, titled &quot;Love, Linda: The Life of Mrs. Cole Porter&quot;, starring jazz vocalist Stevie Holland, ran Off-Broadway at the York Theatre in 2013.

<doc id="868019" wikidata="Q489448" url="?curid=868019" title="Trunk shot">
<text>The trunk shot is a cinematic camera angle which captures film from inside the trunk of a car. Though the trunk shot can be produced by placing the camera inside the trunk, the considerable bulk of a conventional movie camera and camera operator makes this difficult. Therefore, the shot is usually &quot;cheated&quot; by having the art department place a trunk door and some of the trunk frame close enough to the camera to make it appear to be shot from within a car. The trunk shot is a specialized type of low-angle shot.

==In film==
This camera angle is often noted to be the trademark of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. Although he did not invent it, Tarantino popularized the trunk shot, which is featured in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;, &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. In &quot;Death Proof&quot;, Tarantino&#x27;s traditional shot looking up at the actors from the trunk of a car is replaced by one looking up from under the hood.

The earliest trunk shot can be noted in the 1948 movie by Anthony Mann (though credited to Alfred L. Werker), &quot;He Walked by Night&quot;, when the police are inspecting the contents of a murder suspect&#x27;s trunk. Another use of the shot is in 1967 film &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (directed by Richard Brooks) after the two outlaws cross the borders to Mexico in a stolen car. In the thriller &quot;Spasmo&quot;, directed by Umberto Lenzi in 1974, this shot can be seen when the main character opens the trunk and a dead man appears. A trunk shot appears also in George Miller&#x27;s 1985 movie &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; when Max, Master and the savage children are following Jedediah&#x27;s son while escaping from their chasers guided by Entity. It is also used in the John Hughes film &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989), wherein Buck (John Candy) opens his trunk to reveal a tied up teenager who cheated on Buck&#x27;s niece. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot; has a trunk shot where the kids are discussing whether the babysitter&#x27;s body will fit. The 1992 film &quot;Sneakers&quot; contains a trunk shot when Robert Redford&#x27;s character is kidnapped. There is also a trunk shot used in &quot;A Good Day to Die Hard&quot;, when John McClane and his son Jack find a trunk full of guns and ammo in a car they are about to steal. Paul Thomas Anderson used the shot in his short film &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Coffee&quot; (1993) and Jonathan Mostow in &quot;Breakdown&quot; (1997). In &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006), there is a scene with a similar perspective, where Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth and Norrington find a buried chest and the camera looks up to them from inside the hole in the ground that the chest is in.
This shot was also featured in a south Indian film named Aavesham (2024) in a song sequence which features the lead character’s birthday celebration.

==In television==
In episode 11 of the first season of &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, a series of trunk shots are used during the episode&#x27;s intro. In the CW&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural&quot; TV series, trunk shots can be seen looking up at the protagonists, Dean Winchester and Sam Winchester, in both the pilot episode and the second season&#x27;s finale. In the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;The Boys&quot;, a trunk shot is used many times throughout the show. Both &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;The Boys&quot; were developed by Eric Kripke. The trunk shot is also used several times in AMC&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. A trunk shot can be seen in the episode &quot;18 Miles Out&quot; (episode 10) from the second season of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. On &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; season 8 episode 18, &quot;Emmett&#x27;s Brother-In-Law&quot;, Andy, Howard, and Goober are seen looking under the hood of Emmett&#x27;s brother-in-law&#x27;s car. In the Netflix series &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot;, season 1 episode 3, a trunk shot is seen when the two hitmen open the car to reveal Klaus in the trunk.

==In music videos==
* In Colombian pop-singer Shakira&#x27;s music video &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;, Shakira is shown from a trunk shot, smiling sadistically at her ex-boyfriend and his mistress, who are bound and gagged in the trunk of her car, which she then slams shut.
* In Axelle Red&#x27;s 1998 music video &quot;Rester Femme&quot;, Axelle is shown from a trunk shot looking at her husband, who is bound and gagged in the trunk of her car, which she then slams shut and blasts off.

==Other uses==
The trunk shot was used in the 2002 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, in a scene resembling the trunk shot scene of Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. In it, Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance pull weaponry from a car&#x27;s trunk before storming in on Ricardo Diaz&#x27;s mansion.

<text>Agathos Daimon (, , ) originally was a lesser deity (&quot;daemon&quot;) of classical ancient Greek religion and Graeco-Egyptian religion. In his original Greek form, he served as a household god, to whom, along with Zeus Soter, libations were made after a meal. In later Ptolemaic antiquity he took on two partially distinct roles; one as the Agathos Daimon a prominent serpentine civic god, who served as the special protector of Alexandria. The other as a genus of serpentine household gods, the Agathoi Daimones, individual protectors of the homes in which they were worshipped.

== Early history ==
Agathos Daimon was attested in domestic context in Greece as early as the fifth century BC, and yet he was typically not represented there in the form of a snake, as opposed to in Alexandria, where he was abundantly so represented.

: &quot;His origin in Alexandria is a matter of dispute, with two conflicting views either painting Agathos Daimon as a Greek cultural importation later identified with Serapis and with Egyptian gods Šai (Shai), Knephis (Kneph), Khnum, Soknopis, or as a Hellenized native Egyptian household god. Quaegebeur points out the near absence of Greek sources of the Ptolemaic age for the cult of Agathos Daimon, contrasted with the abundance of Egyptian attestations of the god Šai in this age and the poignant evidence of the Oracle of the Potter ...&quot;

The Oracle of the Potter, an Egyptian nationalistic text, predicted the coming doom of Alexandria, with the local gods Knephis (also often represented as a serpent) and Agathos Daimon leaving the city for Memphis, and the defeat of the Macedonian invaders, and their &#x27;age of chaos&#x27;.

==Greek classical period==
Though he is noted in Greek mythology (Pausanias conjectured that the name was merely an epithet of Zeus), it was customary to drink or pour out a few drops of unmixed wine to honor the Agathos Daimon after a meal. In Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Peace&quot;, when War has trapped Peace (Εἰρήνη &quot;Eirene&quot;) in a deep pit, Hermes comes to give aid: &quot;Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when, freed of quarrels and fighting, we should rescue sweet &quot;Eirene&quot; and draw her out of this pit... This is the moment to drain a cup in honor of the &quot;Agathos Daimon&quot;.&quot; A temple dedicated to them was situated on the road from Megalopolis to Maenalus in Arcadia.

&quot;Agathos Daimon&quot; was the spouse or companion of &quot;Tyche Agathe&quot; (, &quot;Good Fortune&quot;). &quot;Tyche we know at Lebadeia as the wife of the Agathos Daimon, the Good or Rich Spirit&quot;. Their numinous presence could be represented in art as a serpent or more concretely as a young man bearing a cornucopia and a bowl in one hand, and a poppy and an ear of grain in the other.

Agathos Daimon was also identified with Zeus Meilichios, as well as with Serapis.

In Egypt, a similar deity was Shai, who was known as the god of fate. His worship went back as far as the time of Akhenaten in the New Kingdom.

==Egyptian late antiquity==
In the syncretic atmosphere of late Antiquity, agathodaemons could be bound up with Egyptian bringers of security and good fortune: a gem carved with magic emblems bears the images of Serapis with crocodile, sun-lion and Osiris mummy surrounded by the lion-headed snake Chnum–Agathodaemon–Aion, with Harpocrates on the reverse.

<doc id="868024" wikidata="Q3121666" url="?curid=868024" title="Razzle (musician)">
<text>Nicholas Charles Dingley (2 December 1960 – 8 December 1984), better known by his stage name Razzle, was an English musician, who was the drummer of the Finnish glam rock band Hanoi Rocks from 1982 until his death in 1984.

==Early years==
Born in Royal Leamington Spa, England, to a young single mother, Patricia Ingram, who decided to give up her child for adoption. He was adopted by Henry and Irene Dingley. The family&#x27;s only child, he grew up in Coventry, after which the family moved to the village of Binstead, Isle of Wight.

Prior to joining Hanoi Rocks, Razzle started playing in local Binstead small ensembles, one of which was called Thin Red Line. In 1980 he moved to London, where he played in several punk rock bands. Also, he joined Demon Preacher (featuring Nik Wade, later of Alien Sex Fiend), The Fuck Pigs and The Dark, with whom he released one EP &quot;The Living End Live&quot; in 1981, which was recorded at the band&#x27;s last gig in London&#x27;s 100 Club which, in his own words, was heavy punk, almost heavy metal.

==Hanoi Rocks==

Razzle first collaborated with Hanoi Rocks on Sounds magazine pages. After seeing the band performing at the Zig-Zag Club, Razzle was convinced that Hanoi Rocks was a band he would like to join. He came backstage and asked to be the band&#x27;s drummer. Gyp Casino, who was the band&#x27;s drummer, was fired for his porn addiction, depression and suicidal thoughts; and Razzle became his replacement. Although Razzle was depicted on the &quot;Self Destruction Blues&quot; album cover, he didn&#x27;t play on the record.

He became an important element of Hanoi Rocks, due to his repartee and an ability to find a way out of difficult times and problems between members.

In 1983, Sami Yaffa disclosed that he and Razzle were planning to leave the band, citing Andy McCoy&#x27;s insufferable behaviour as the main cause.

In 1984 Razzle along with the other members of Hanoi Rocks appeared on the first eponymous album by the punk band Fallen Angels, a project of Knox of The Vibrators. At the time Knox and the Hanoi Rocks shared the same manager.

==Death==
In late 1984, Hanoi Rocks were on their first American tour. Frontman Michael Monroe fractured his ankle, so the band had to skip a few shows to allow Monroe to heal. During that break, Mötley Crüe&#x27;s singer Vince Neil invited the band to visit his home in Redondo Beach, California.

On 8 December, Hanoi Rocks band members were partying with Mötley Crüe at Neil&#x27;s house. The party stopped when everybody noticed they were out of beer. Neil and Razzle, both drunk, went to a nearby liquor store in Neil&#x27;s De Tomaso Pantera, with Neil driving. On the way back, they crashed into another car. Razzle was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead at 7:12 p.m.; he had died instantly in the collision.

Both occupants of the other car were seriously injured, sustaining brain damage as a result of the crash. Vince Neil was charged with vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol in connection with the crash. His blood alcohol content was 0.17, above the California legal limit at that time of 0.10. In September 1985, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Edward Hinz, Jr., sentenced Neil to 30 days in jail and five years probation.

Andy McCoy and Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee went looking for Neil and Razzle. They drove by the crash site, and saw Neil handcuffed and placed in a police car. They were informed that Razzle had been taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. McCoy informed the band&#x27;s manager Seppo Vesterinen, who then told the rest of the band.

He was buried at Holy Cross Church in Binstead, on the Isle of Wight in 1984.

Neil dedicated &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot;, Mötley Crüe&#x27;s third studio album, to Razzle. In 2015, Neil admitted to Ultimate Classic Rock that he paid $US2.5 million to the courts, so he only served 19 days of a 30-day sentence for the reckless death.

Neil&#x27;s account of this event, which is contradictory to witness accounts, is documented in Mötley Crüe&#x27;s 2001 autobiography &quot;The Dirt: Confessions of the World&#x27;s Most Notorious Rock Band&quot;.

==Media portrayal==
Max Milner portrayed Razzle in the 2019 film adaptation of Mötley Crüe’s autobiography.
