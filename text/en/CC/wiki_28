<text>Mu&#x27;izz al-Din Muhammad ibn Sam (; 15 March 1206), also known as Muhammad of Ghor or Muhammad Ghori, was a ruler from the Ghurid dynasty based in the Ghor region of what is today central Afghanistan who ruled from 1173 to 1206. Muhammad and his elder brother Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad ruled in a dyarchy until the latter&#x27;s death in 1203. Ghiyath al-Din, the senior partner, governed the western Ghurid regions from his capital at Firozkoh whereas Muhammad extended Ghurid rule eastwards, laying the foundation of Islamic rule in South Asia, which lasted after him for nearly half a millennium under evolving Muslim dynasties.

During his early career as governor of the southern tract of Ghurid Empire, Muhammad subjugated the Oghuz Turks after a series of forays and annexed Ghazni where he was installed by Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad as an independent sovereign. Expanding the Ghurid dominion east of the Indus Delta from his base in Ghazni, Muhammad crossed the river Indus in 1175, approaching it through the Gomal Pass and captured Multan and Uch from the Carmathians within a year. Afterwards, Muhammad took his army by the way of lower Sindh, endeavoring to penetrate into present-day Gujarat through the Thar Desert, only to end up getting wounded and routed near Mount Abu at Kasahrada by a coalition of Rajput chiefs led by the Chaulukya king Mularaja, which forced him to change his route for future inroads into the Indian Plains. Hence, Muhammad pressed upon the Ghaznavids and uprooted them by 1186, conquering the upper Indus Plain along with most of the Punjab. After expelling the Ghaznavids from their last bastion, Muhammad, thus secured the Khyber Pass, the traditional route of entry for invading armies into northern India.

Extending the Ghurid dominion further eastwards into the Gangetic Plain, the Ghurid forces suffered a decisive reverse and Muhammad himself got wounded in engagement with the Rajput Confederacy led by the Chahamana ruler Prithviraj Chauhan at Tarain in 1191. Muhammad returned to Khurasan, and returned a year later with a vast army of mounted archers to secure a decisive victory in the return engagement on the same battleground and executed Prithviraj shortly afterwards. He limited his presence in India afterwards, deputing the political and military operations in the region to a handful of elite slave commanders who swiftly raided local Indian kingdoms and extended the Ghurid influence as far east as the Ganges delta in Bengal and regions to the north in Bihar.

After the death of Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad in 1203, Muhammad of Ghor ascended the throne of Firozkoh as well, becoming the supreme Sultan of the Ghurid Empire. Within a year or so, Muhammad suffered a devastating defeat at Andkhud against their Turkish rivals Khwarazmians aided by timely reinforcements from the Qara Khitais, which resulted in the Ghurid power ebbing out in most of the Khurasan. Muhammad quelled the widespread insurrection throughout his empire after the debacle and ordered the construction of a bridge over the Oxus River to launch a full-scale invasion of Transoxiana in order to avenge his defeat at Andkhud, although a rebellion by the Hindu Khokhars forced him to move towards the Salt Range, where he brutally crushed the Khokhar revolt during his last campaign.

On his way back, Muhammad of Ghor was assassinated on the bank of Indus at Damyak on 15 March 1206, by the Ismāīlī emissaries while offering evening prayers. Muhammad&#x27;s assassination led to the rapid decline of the Ghurids and enabled Shah Muhammad II to annex remaining Ghurid territories west of the Indus River by 1215. However, his conquests east of the Indus in the Indian Subcontinent, evolved into the formidable Delhi Sultanate under his slave commander Qutbuddin Aibak.

==Early life==
===Birth===
Muhammad of Ghor was born in the Ghur region of present-day west-central Afghanistan to the Ghurid ruler Baha al-Din Sam I who ruled his ancestral realm briefly before he died in 1149, when Muhammad of Ghor was a child. His name is variously transliterated as Muizuddin Sam, Shihabuddin Ghuri, Muhammad Ghori and Muhammad of Ghor. According to the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, his birth name was &quot;Muhammad&quot; which is vernacularly spelt as &quot;Hamad&quot; by the Ghurids. During his childhood, his mother used to call him &quot;Zangi&quot; due to his dark skin tone. After the coronation in Ghazni, he styled himself as &quot;Malik Shihabuddin&quot; and after his occupation of Khurasan, he took the title of &quot;Muizzuddin&quot; or &quot;Mu&#x27;izz al-Din&quot;.

The synchronous accounts did not write much about Muhammad&#x27;s exact birth date, although based on the writings of Juzjani - Muhammad was younger to Ghiyath al-Din by three years and few months, who was born in 1140. Therefore, Muhammad&#x27;s birth year can be dated to 1144.

===Accession to the throne===
The early years of both Muhammad and his brother Ghiyath al-Din were spent in constant hardship. Their uncle Ala al-Din Husayn after his campaign in Ghazni, initially installed them as governors of Sanjah. However, their efficient administration of the province, made him doubtful of their loyalty and seeing a possible challenge to his own authority, he ordered his nephews to be imprisoned in the castle of Gharjistan. Although, they were released from the captivity by his son Sayf al-Din Muhammad after the death of his father in 1161. Sayf al-Din, later died in a battle against the nomadic Oghuzs of Balkh.

‌After their release from the captivity, &quot;Tarik-i-Firishtah&quot; states that the Ghurid siblings were reinstated in Sanjah, although the earlier account of &quot;Tabaqat-i-Nasiri&quot; stated that the hardship continued due to their financial conditions. Muhammad thus, took shelter in the court of his uncle Fakhruddin Masud who held the principality of Bamiyan as vassal of their uncle Alauddin Husayn.

Later, Fakhr al-Din Masud laid his own claim for the succession after Sayf al-Din death as the elder member of the Ghurid family. Muhammad helped his brother in suppressing the revolt of Fakhruddin who garnered a sizeable army in alliance with the chiefs of Balkh and Herat who both were executed in the battle, although Fakhruddin was reinstated in Bamiyan in 1163. Afterwards, with the support of the remaining local Ghurid officers and &quot;maliks&quot;, his brother succeeded Sayf al-Din to the throne in 1163 and initially placed Muhammad as a minor officer in his court, which result in him retiring (unhappy with his position) to the court of Sistan where he spend a whole season. However, later Ghiyath-al din sent an envoy to brought him back who subsequently placed him in charge of the southern part of the Ghurid domains which possibly included Istiyan and Kajuran. 
During the early campaigns of Muhammad as a prince, he was instructed to subdue the Oghuz tribes whose power and influence began to wane, although they were still controlling extensive territories. He used Kandahar as a base and raided the principality of Oghuzs multiple times, before defeating them decisively along with Ghiyath al-Din and followed up their victory by conquering Ghazni in 1169 along with some other territories in what is present-day eastern Afghanistan. Soon, Muhammad&#x27;s coronation took place in Ghazni in 1173 and his brother returned to Firuzkuh for the westwards expansion in Transoxania. Subsequently, Muhammad utilized the city of Ghazni as a launch pad to led a series of lucrative forays down to the Indus Delta and beyond. In 1174, Muhammad led an expedition against the Ghuzzs of Sanquran in present-day Turkmenistan and subdued them.

In 1175, Muhammad marched from Ghazni and helped his brother in the annexation of the cosmopolitan city of Herat and Pushang after defeating a former general of the Seljuks. The Ghurid siblings advanced into the present-day Iran and brought Nasrid dynasty of Sistan under their sway whose ruler Taj al-Din III Harb ibn Muhammad ibn Nasr acknowledged the Ghurid suzerainty and later sent his armies several times assisting the Ghurids in their warfares. Afterwards, Ghiyath al-Din captured Balkh and territories adjoining Herat in Khurasan.

===Title===
After the death of Ghiyath Al-Din Muhammad – the senior partner in the dyarchy – Muhammad assumed the title of &quot;Al-Sultan Al-Azam&quot; which meant the &quot;Greatest Sultan&quot;. On one of colonnade in the Qutb Minar along with some of his golden mints circulated in India – Muhammad is eulogized as the &quot;Sikander Al-Thani&quot;. (Second Alexander)

Muhammad&#x27;s courtier rhetorically aggrandize him as the champion of Islam styling him as the &quot;Sultan-i-Ghazi&quot; (sultan of the holy warriors) portraying his Indian expeditions as the engagement between the army of Islam (&quot;Lashkar-i Islam&quot;) and the army of infidels (&quot;Lashkar-i Kuffar&quot;).

== Invasion of India ==
===Early invasions===
The Ghurid brothers ruling in a dyarchy with the senior partner Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad engaged in a protracted duel with the Khwarazmians from his capital Firuzkuh situated in west-central Afghanistan, while Muhammad expanded the Ghurid domains eastwards into the Indian plains from his capital at Ghazni. The expeditions into the Indian plains and the plunder extracted from the sacking of lucrative Hindu temples in the Gangetic Plain, gave Muhammad access to a vast amount of treasure in Ghazni which according to chronicler Juzjani based on the authority of Muhammad&#x27;s comptroller included 60,000 kg (1500 mann) of jewels.

Muhammad&#x27;s expeditions in the Indian subcontinent started against the Qarmatians (sevener branch of Isma&#x27;ilis) who regained a foothold in Multan, soon after the death of Mahmud of Ghazni who installed a Sunni governor there. Muhammad defeated the Qarmatian ruler Khafif in 1175 and annexed Multan. The defeat turned to be a death blow for the Qarmatian power in Multan, who never regained their influence in the region again.

After the conquest of Multan, Muhammad captured Uch which was situated south of the confluence of the rivers Chenab and Jhelum. His campaign in Uch is not mentioned in detail in the near contemporary accounts except Kāmil fit-Tārīkh, although the detail in the text about his expedition in Uch is possibly blurred by a legend associated with the Bhati Rajputs. Nonetheless, Firishta, a later chronicler mentioned the year of Uch conquest as 1176. It was placed under Malik Nasiurdin Aitam until his death in the Battle of Andkhud in 1204. Afterwards, it was placed under Nasiruddin Qabacha.

During the course of his early invasions, Muhammad avoided Punjab and instead focused on lands bordering the middle and lower course of the Indus. Therefore, to outflank the Ghaznavids in Punjab and to open up an alternative route to the Northern India, Muhammad turned south towards present-day Gujarat in Anhilwara. Before entering in Anhilwara, he laid siege to the fort of Nadol (around Marwar) and captured it after a short siege from Kelhanadeva along with sacking the Shiva temple in Kiradu. After marching through the dry Thar Desert south of Marwar, the Ghurid army got exhausted, when they reached Mount Abu where they were routed in the mountainous pass of Gadararaghatta, by the Solanki ruler Mularaja II who was also aided by other Rajput chiefs mainly the Naddula Chahamana ruler Kelhanadeva (who was earlier deposed by from Nadol by Muhammad), the Jalor Chahamana ruler Kirtipala, and the Arbuda Paramara ruler Dharavarsha. The Ghurid army suffered heavy casualties during the battle, and also in the retreat back across the desert to Ghazni. The defeat forced Muhammad to opt for the northern routes who thenceforth, concentrated on creating a suitable base in Punjab and northwest for further incursions into northern India.

===Conquest of Punjab===

In 1179, Muhammad conquered Peshawar which was possibly ruled by the Ghaznavids. Thereafter, he advanced further and besieged Lahore in 1181, although Khusrau Malik managed to keep him around the borders of Lahore for few more years by sending tributes along with one of the Ghaznavid prince (Malik Shah) under his custody in Ghazni as a hostage. In 1182, Muhammad followed a southerly arc to the port city of Debal on the Arabian Sea coast of Sindh, subjugating the Soomras. In the subsequent years, he expanded and consolidated his conquests around present-day Pakistan and annexed Sialkot along with sacking Lahore and the countryside. After Khusrau Malik made an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the Ghurid garrison in Sialkot, Muhammad made the final assault on Lahore and forced him to surrender after a short siege. He imprisoned Khusrau Malik in the fort of Gharchistan, breaching his own agreement of safe conduct for his presence. Khusrau Malik was sent to Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad in Firuzkuh where he and all his kinfolks were executed before 1192. Thus, ended the lineage of Ghaznavids and their historic struggle with the Ghurids.

After uprooting the Ghaznavids, Muhammad now established his sway over the strategic Indus Basin including most of the Punjab. He, appointed Mulla Sirajuddin who was earlier a high-ranking Qāḍi in his father court, as the head of judicature department in the newly conquered Ghaznavid territories along with the charge of Multan. His son Minhaj al-Siraj Juzjani (born 1193) later composed the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri in 1260 which is regarded as a monumental work from the medieval period on the Ghurid dynasty and the Delhi Sultanate.

=== First Battle of Tarain ===

In 1190, after consildating in Sindh and western Punjab, the Ghurid generals began to raid the eastern Punjab region and captured a castle - Bathinda in present-day Punjab state on the northwestern frontier of Prithviraj Chauhan&#x27;s kingdom. After appointing a Qazi Zia-ud-Din of Tulak as governor of the fortress with 1200 horsemen, Muhammad received the news that Prithviraj&#x27;s army, led by his vassal prince Govind Rai were on their way to besiege the fortress. The two armies eventually met near the town of Tarain, 14 miles from Thanesar in present-day Haryana. The battle was marked by the initial attack of mounted Mamluk archers to which Prithviraj responded by counter-attacking from three sides and thus dominating the battle. Muhammad mortally wounded Govind Rai in personal combat and in the process was himself wounded, whereupon his army retreated and Prithvīrāj&#x27;s army was deemed victorious.

According to Juzjani, Muhammad was carried away from the battleground in wounded state by a Khalji horsemen. A largely different account from Za&#x27;inul Masir claimed that Muhammad after being wounded in combat with Govindraja fell unconscious and his forces withdrew in disarray after assuming him to be dead, later a remnant of his soldiers arrived in the night and searched for his body at the battle site. Muhammad in extremely critical situation recognised his soldiers, who rejoiced after finding him alive and took him from the battlefield in a litter to Ghazni. However, the version from Za&#x27;inul Masir is not corroborated by any other contemporary and later writers, which made its authenticity dubious and the version of Juzjani more credible.

The Ghurid garrison of Tabarhind under Ziauddin, held out for thirteen months before being capitulated. The Rajputs could not make quick progressions during the siege due to absence of siege engines on their part, which strengthened the position of Muhammad during these months to raise a formidable army.

=== Second Battle of Tarain ===

After the defeat in Tarain, Muhammad meted out severe punishments to the Ghurid, Khalji and Afghan &quot;emirs&quot; who fled during the battle. The wallets filled with grains were tied around their necks and under this condition they were paraded through Ghazni, those who refused were beheaded. The late medieval historian Ferishta further states on the testimony of folklore in Ghazni, that Muhammad vowed not to visit his royal harem and heal his wounds sustained in the battle till he avenged the humiliation of his defeat. Husain Kharmil, a prominent Iranian general of the Ghurids, was called from Ghazni with a large contingent along with other seasoned warlords like Mukalba, Kharbak and Illah. Muhammad made necessary arrangements to counter the elephant phalanx of the Rajput forces by having them attack mock elephants made of mud and wood. The near contemporary chroniclers Juzjani and Isami stated that Muhammad brought 120,000-130,000 fully armoured men to the battle in 1192. Ferishta placed the strength of Rajput army in the decisive battle at 3,000 elephants, 300,000 cavalry and infantry (most likely a gross exaggeration).

Prithviraj Chauhan had called his banners but hoped to buy time as his banners (other Rajputs under him or his allies) had not arrived. Instead of engaging in direct confrontation as they did in the initial Battle of Tarain, the Ghurids adopted a strategy of deceit and diplomacy to overcome the Rajputs, as documented in Taj-ul Ma&#x27;asir by Hasan Nizami. Upon Ghori&#x27;s arrival on the battlefield, Prithviraj, the Rajput leader, purportedly sent a formal message suggesting a peaceful resolution, stating, &quot;It would be wise for you to return to your homeland, and we have no intention of pursuing you.&quot; In response, Ghori replied, indicating that he had come to face challenges on the directive of his ruling sibling and proposing the dispatch of an envoy to negotiate peace.

According to accounts from Hasan Nizami, Muhammad Ufi, and Firishta, it becomes evident that Ghori employed deception, and Prithviraj, considering it a genuine truce, accepted the proposal. Before the next day, the Ghurids attacked the Rajput army. The assault occurred before sunrise, catching the Chahamana army off guard as they had spent the night in a state of unawareness. Although they were able to quickly form formations, they suffered losses due to surprise attacks before sunrise. Juzjani attributed the success of the Ghurid army to the 10,000 elite mounted archers whom Muhammad stationed at a small distance from the elephant phalanx of the Rajput forces and which ultimately scattered the &quot;infidel host&quot;. Prithviraj was captured during the battle on the bank of river Saraswati (present-day Sirsa) and summarily executed. After the victory, Muhammad took over much of the Chahamana kingdom and sacked their capital Ajmer during which several Hindu temples were desecrated by the Ghurids in Ajmer.

Muhammad captured and placed strong garrisons at the strategic military stations of Sirsa, Hansi, Samana and Kohram. Muhammad later installed Prithviraja&#x27;s minor son Govindaraja IV as his puppet ruler on condition of heavy tribute. However, later after a revolt by his uncle Hariraja, Govindraja was forced to move towards Ranthambore, where he established a new dynasty of the Chahamanas. Hariraja, briefly dislodged the Ghurid garrison from Ajmer, but was later defeated by Qutb ud-Din Aibak. Subsequently, Hairaja immolated himself on a funeral pyre and the Ghurids reoccupied Ajmer and placed it under a Muslim governor. Soon after, Delhi was also captured by Muhammad and Qutb al-Din Aibak in 1193, although in continuation with the policy adopted earlier in Ajmer, a puppet Rajput scion was installed in Delhi on tribute. (possibly the son of Govindraja who died in Tarain) However, he was soon deposed on the account of treason.

While, Muhammad continued to carry raids in the north Indian plain, although later he got preoccupied with the Ghurid expansion in Transoxiana against the Khwarezmian Empire as his brother Ghiyath al-Din began to have health problems. Notwithstanding, Muhammad as per the writings of Fakhr-i Mudabbir and Minhaj-i Siraj Juzjani, appointed Aibak as his administrator of the Ghurid domains in North India after the Second Battle of Tarain. His lieutenants - Qutb ud-Din Aibak, Bahauddin Tughril, Bakhtiyar Khalji and Yildiz before his assassination, swiftly raided the local kingdoms and expanded his empire in the Indian Subcontinent up to north-western parts of Bengal in east, Ajmer and Ranthambore (Rajasthan) in north and till the borders of Ujjain in south.

=== Further campaigns ===

After Aibak consolidated the Ghurid rule in and around the Delhi doab, Muhammad himself returned to India to further expand down the Ganges Valley. Accordingly, in 1194, he crossed the Jamuna river with an army of 50,000 horsemen where he confronted the forces of the Rajput Gahadavala king Jayachandra in the Battle of Chandawar. The Ghurid army was victorious, Jayachandra was killed in the battle, and much of his army was slaughtered. Following the battle, the Ghurids took the fort at Asni, where they plundered the royal treasure of the Gahadavalas, and went on to take the pilgrimage city of Varanasi, which was looted and a large number of its temples destroyed. The Gahadavala capital Kanauj was annexed in 1198. During this campaign, the Buddhist city of Sarnath was also sacked.

===Conquest of Bayana===

Muhammad returned to the Indian frontier again around 1196 to consolidate his hold around the present-day Rajasthan. The territory of Bayana at the time was under the control of a sect of Jadaun Rajputs. Muhammad along with Aibak advanced and besieged Thankar whose ruler Kumarpal was defeated. Muhammad placed the fort under his senior slave Bahauddin Tughril, who later established Sultankot and used it as his stronghold. After the conquest of Thankar, Bahaurddin Turghil reduced the fort of Gwalior whose Parihar chief Sallakhanapala surrendered after a long siege and accepted the Ghurid suzerainty. After the assassination of Muhammad, Tourghil styled himself as the Sultan in Bayana.

In 1197, Qutb ud-Din Aibak invaded Gujarat and defeated Bhima II in Sirohi after a sudden attack and afterwards sacked his capital Anhilwara. Thus, Aibak avenged the rout of Muhammad at the same place in 1178.

==Struggle in Central Asia==
Muhammad continued to aid his brother for the expansion in west against the Khwarezmians in the interlude of his eastwards expansion. Meanwhile, in the affairs of Khurasan, Sultan Shah was defeated by his brother Ala al-Din Tekish in alliance with the Qara Khitai troops and the latter succeeded the throne of Khwarezm in December 1172. Sultan Shah fled to the Ghurid brothers and asked for their assistance in order to expel his brother Tekish. While they received him well, they refused to give him military aid against Tekish, with whom the Ghurids were on good terms till then. Sultan Shah, carved out his independent principality in Khurasan and began plundering the regions of Ghor along with his governor Bahauddin Turghil. Thus, Ghiyath al-Din asked for aid from Muhammad, who was occupied with his Indian expeditions at the time, marched with his army from Ghazni. The Ghurid feudatories: Shamsuddin Muhammad of Bamiyan and Tajuddin of Herat joined them with their respective contingents against the Khwarezmians.

The Ghurid forces decisively defeated Sultan Shah on the banks of river Murgabh after months of campaigning and executed their governor of Herat Bahauddin Turghil while Sultan Shah fled to Merv. The Ghurids followed their victory by recapturing Herat. Sultan Shah died after a year in 1191 possibly due to the drug overdose. According to historian A.B.M. Habibullah, the Ghurids could not annex any territory in Khurasan outside Herat which remained under the sway of Tekesh and who by 1193 captured much of the Persia along with the Trans-Caspian belt. Conversely, C. E. Bosworth stated that Ghurids annexed some part of Khurasan after their victory in Merv.

===Later===

Tekish died in 1200, which led to a brief period of struggle for the succession between Alauddin Shah of Khwarezm and his nephew Hindu Khan. The Ghurid siblings seized the opportunity and amidst the turmoil in the Khwarezmian house for succession, Muhammad and Ghiyath al-Din invaded and captured the oasis cities of Nishapur, Merv and Tus and reached as far as Gorgan. The Ghurids, thus, for a short span established their sway over most of the Khurasan for first time in their history. However, their success turned to be a short-term affair as Alauddin succeeded the throne in August 1200 and soon after recaptured his lost territories by 1201. Despite the success against the Ghurids, Alauddin sent an envoy for diplomacy to Muhammad, probably in order to focus solely on overcoming from the suzerainty of Qara Khitais by sougthing peace with the Ghurids. However, the attempt turned to be futile and Muhammad marched again with his forces on Nishapur which forced Alauddin to shut himself inside the city walls. Muhammad recaptured Tus along with Herat and sacked the country-side.

Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad around this time died at Herat on 13 March 1203, after months of illness which briefly diverted Muhammad&#x27;s attention from the existing state of affairs. Thus, taking advantage of his absence from Herat where he appointed his nephew Alp Ghazi, Khwarezmian forces captured Merv and beheaded the Ghurid governor Karang there. Muhammad of Ghor, possibly to take over the entire Khwarezmian Empire, laid siege to their capital Gurganj, instead of Herat which was besieged by the Khwarezmians after Ghiyath al-Din&#x27;s death. Alauddin retreated on the Ghurid advance and desperately requested aid from the Qara Khitais, who sent a sizeable army to aid the Khwarezmians. Muhammad, because of the pressure from the Qara Khitai forces was forced to relieve the siege and retreat. However, he was chased on his way to Firuzkuh and was decisively defeated in the Battle of Andkhud in 1204 by the combined forces of Qara Khitai and Kara-Khanid Khanate under Taniku and Uthman ibn Ibrahim. He was allowed to return to his capital, after paying a heavy ransom to the Qara Khitai general Taniku (Tayangu) which included several elephants and gold coins. According to Juzjani, the negotiations between Muhammad and Taniku were arranged by Uthman ibn Ibrahim of Samarkand who did not want the &quot;Sultan of Islam&quot; to be captured by &#x27;the infidels&quot;. Following the defeat, the Ghurids lost the control over most of the Khurasan except Herat and Balkh. Thus, Muhammad of necessity agreed for a cold peace with the Khwarezmians.

==Final days==
After the disaster of Andkhud and the subsequent rumours of Muhammad&#x27;s death in the battle led to widespread insurrections throughout the Ghurid Sultanate, most notably by Aibak Beg, Husain Kharmil and by the governor of Ghazni, Yildiz, as well. Muhammad first marched to Multan instead of Ghazni, where his slave general Aibak Beg (who rescued him in Battle of Andkhud) assassinated the Ghurid governor Amir Dad Hasan in a personal meeting and issued a fake decree of him being appointed by Muhammad as the new governor of Multan. Muhammad defeated Aibak Beg decisively and captured him in the battle. Afterwards, he marched towards Ghazni, where Yildiz mutinied earlier and seized the city. On the advance of a vast army of Muhammad of Ghor, foreseeing an inevitable defeat, Yildiz and his aristocrats surrendered to Muhammad, who pardoned them.

Thus, Muhammad successfully restored his empire to stability, after suppressing the mutineers and turned his attention towards the affairs of Central Asia again to avenge the rout at Andhkhud and to reclaim his holdings in Khurasan. Accordingly, by July 1205, Muhammad&#x27;s governor of Balkh besieged Tirmidh in the present-day Uzbekistan and captured the city following a short siege, destroying the Qara Khitai garrison stationed there and placed it under his son. Afterwards, 
Muhammad ordered his viceory in the Bamiyan Valley, Baha al-Din Sam II to construct a boat bridge and a castle across the river Oxus to facilitate the march of his armies in Transoxiana. Muhammad also directed his Indian soldiers to join him in the expedition against the Qara Khitais. However, soon another political unrest broke out which turned Muhammad towards Punjab again where he was eventually assassinated.

===Campaign against Khokhars===

The Khokhar tribe whose influence extended from the lower Indus until Siwalik hills, arose in the wake of Muhammad&#x27;s rout in the Battle of Andkhud and rebelled by disrupting the Ghurid communication chain between Lahore and Ghazni along with plundering Lahore. According to Juzjani, the Khokhars were hostile to Muslims and use to &quot;torment every &quot;Musalman they captured&quot;.

Hence, Muhammad marched from Ghazni in December 1205 for his last campaign in order to subjugate the Khokhars. The Khokhars led by Bakan and Sarkha offered a battle somewhere between the Chenab and Jhelum rivers and fought valiantly until the afternoon but Muhammad carried the day after Iltutmish arrived with a reserve contingent, whom Muhammad earlier stationed on the banks of Jhelum. Muhammad followed his victory by a large scale slaughter of the Khokhars. His armies also burnt down the forests where many of them took refuge while fleeing.

Iltutmish was rewarded for his gallantry against the Khokhars with a presentation of special robe of honour from Muhammad. According to Juzjani, Muhammad also manumitted Illtutmish, despite the fact that his master Aibak who purchased him originally was still a slave along with other senior slaves of Muhammad who were not manumitted until that point.

==Assassination==
After crushing the Khokhars, on his way back to his capital in Ghazni, Muhammad&#x27;s caravan rested at Dhamiak near Sohawa (which is near the city of Jhelum in the Punjab province of modern-day Pakistan) where he was assassinated on March 15, 1206, by the Ismāʿīlī emissaries.

According to some sketchy accounts regarding the identity of Muhammad&#x27;s assassins, claimed that the assassins were sent by Muhammad II of Khwarezm. However, the Khwarezmians already curbed the Ghurid ambition in Transoxiana after the Andkhud debacle and were not facing any potential danger from them. Hence, historian Mohammad Habib theorizes that this speculation that the Ismaili assassins were sent by the Khwarezmian Shah is unlikely to be correct. Muhammad&#x27;s assassins were probably sent by the Imam of Alamut whose castle he sacked during the Khurasan expedition.

Some later accounts possibly with the genesis in the writing of Ferishta claimed that his assassins were Hindu Khokhars. In &quot;Tarikh-i-Firishta&quot;, he stated that &quot;Twenty Khokhar infidels&quot; who were cowed down by him earlier attacked his carvan and stabbed him with a &quot;dagger&quot;. However, this account is not corroborated by the earlier authorities. Minhaj al-Siraj Juzjani, Hasan Nizami and Shams ad-Dīn adh-Dhahabi all contemporary or near contemporary accounts confirmed that Muhammad was assassinated by a &quot;Heretic devote&quot; (&quot;fida-i-mulahida&quot;). The story of his assassination by the Khokhars is probably an invention of later times based on indirect evidences. Muhammad&#x27;s coffin was carried from Dhamiak to Ghazni by his Vizier Moidul Mulk along with other elites, where he was buried (Ghazni) in the mausoleum of his daughter.

Despite the debacle of Andhkhud and the successive plummet of their western frontier, Muhammad&#x27;s empire at the time of his assassination still spread out as far as Herat in the west, Zamindawar Valley in the south and the Yasin Valley in the north-east.

== Succession ==
Muhammad&#x27;s only offspring was his daughter who died during his own lifetime. His sudden assassination in Damyak led to a period of struggle among his slaves and other senior Ghurid elites for the succession. The Ghurid aristocrats of Ghazni and Fīrūzkūh supported the succession of Baha al-Din Sam II from the Bamiyan branch, although his Turkic slaves supported Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud who was his nephew and son of his brother Ghiyath al-Din. Nonetheless, Baha al-Din died on his march to Ghazni on 24 February 1206 due to illness.

Thus, Muhammad was succeeded by Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud in 1206, although most of his conquests in the Ganga Valley were in the grasp of his lieutenants – Qutb ud-Din Aibak, Taj al-Din Yildiz, Bahauddin Tughril, Nasir ad-Din Qabacha and Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji who barely consulted Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud in their affairs. Notwithstanding, they still paid him a minimal tribute. During his reign, Mahmud also officially grant &quot;manumission&quot; on Aibak and Yildiz. Thus, freed from the slavery and with investment of a &quot;chatr&quot; from Mahmud, Yildiz established himself as the king of Ghazni in 1206 and Aibak in Lahore (who declared independence in 1208) established the Delhi Sultanate. Historian Iqtidar Alam Khan though, doubted that Aibak styled himself as the &quot;Sultan&quot; as it is not attested by the numismatic evidences. Soon, Mahmud was enforced to accept suzerainty of Alauddin Shah of Khawarazm as attested by the numismatic evidences in which he minted his name along with placing Alauddin&#x27;s name in the &quot;khuṭbah&quot; until his assassination in 1212.

Afterwards, the Khwarazmians established their puppet government in the Ghurid lands, although Yildiz drove them back in 1213 before Alauddin eradicated the Ghurids and annexed Fīrūzkūh from Zia al-Din Ali in 1215 who either died as his captive (burned in Iran) or retired to Delhi in exile. Alauddin also defeated and executed the last Ghurid ruler Jalal al-Din Ali from the Bamiyan line in the same year. Thus, the Šansabānī house was extirpated by 1215. Yildiz was toppled from Ghazni around the same time as well who later fled to Delhi and laid his own claim for succession of the Ghurid conquests of Muhammad of Ghor. However, he was defeated and executed in 1216 by Iltutmish in Tarain.

===Relations with slaves===
According to Juzjani&#x27;s Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (c.1260), Muhammad enthusiastically used to purchase several slaves during his lifetime who later according to Juzjani became renowned for their calibre in &quot;east&quot;. Muhammad purchased a young Qabacha who was sold into slavery and was later bestowed with the domains of Kerman and Sanjar for his Iqṭāʿ by the Ghurid Sultan. He raised his slaves with affection and treated them as his sons and successors, after his despondency with his own Ghurid household in his later days. According to another contemporary account of Fakhr-i Mudabbir who wrote under the patronage of Qutb ud-Din Aibak also emphasized upon the importance of each of the Turkish slaves (&quot;bandagan&quot;) to Muhammad. He further panegyrise Aibak for enduring the trust of his master. Muhammad&#x27;s slaves played a key role in the expansion and consolidation of the Ghurid conquests in the Ganga-Jamuna doab when he was engaged in the affairs of Khurasan and amidst this also raised their own authority in the North India while still regarding Muhammad as their supreme master until his assassination.

Muhammad, later also organized matrimonial alliances among the families of his slaves in accordance with the practise of endogamy. The notable among these alliances, were the marriages of the daughters of Taj al-Din Yildiz to Qutb ud-Din Aibak and Nasir ad-Din Qabacha. Further, two daughters of Aibak were married to Qabacha. This policy was continued by Aibak as well, who married his daughter to his slave Illtutmish.

In popular traditions, when a courtier lamented that the Sultan (Muhammad) had no male heirs, he retorted:
== Legacy ==
During the dyarchy of Muhammad and his elder brother Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad, the Ghurids emerged as one of the major powers in the eastern Islamic world. The Ghurids reached the greatest extent of their territorial expansion, where they briefly ruled over a territory which spanned over 3000 km from east to west. During these years, their empire stretched from Gorgan in eastern present-day Iran to Lakhnauti in present-day Bangladesh and from the foothills of the Himalaya south to Sindh (Pakistan).

The Catastrophe of Andkhud and the collapse of the Šansabānī dynasty within a decade of his assassination along with the rise of Genghis Khan who carved out the largest contiguous empire in history made his short-lived successes in the Khurasan and Persia as less consequential in contrast to the more substantial Islamic monarchs of Central Asia. While, Muhammad was not much successful against his Turkish adversaries in the Transoxiana, notwithstanding, his success in the Indian Subcontinent had far flug consequences. The 13th century chronicle &quot;Jawami ul-Hikayat&quot;, by Muhammad Aufi, mentioned that the Sultan (Muhammad of Ghor) &quot;khuṭbah was read in all the mosques from Herat to Assam&quot;. His decisive victory in the Second Battle of Tarain against the Rajput forces of Prithviraja III laid to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate by Qutb ud-Din Aibak which was further consolidated by his slave commander Illtutmish. In the ensuring times, the Sultanate of Delhi turned to be the only major Islamic state that survived amongst the carnage in the Central Asia caused by the Mongols during the thirteenth century.

The Ghurids similar to the Ghaznavids were unpopular among their subjects of the Khurasan. According to Juzjani, Muhammad imposed heavy taxes, plundered and seized the property in Tus for the expanses of his army, which was committed for the protection of a Imam&#x27;s shrine. These events eventually turned the people belligerent towards the Ghurids who retaliated when Muhammad besieged Gurganz and militarily supported the besieged Khwarezmian Shah who as a result collected a hughe army of 70,000 which eventually forced Muhammad to relieve the siege and retreat before being cornered by the Qara Khitai forces.

The Ghor region, however, during his reign did prospered and became a leading centre of learning and culture. He also gave grants to various theologians like Maulana Fakharudin Razi who preached the Islamic teachings in the backward regions of the Ghurid empire. Muhammad also briefly contributed in the archietectural aspect of his region, chiefly constructing distinctive kind of Islamic glazed tiles in his capital Ghazni.

===Memorials===

* A shrine for Muhammad Ghori was built in Dhamiak by Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan in 1994-1995 and was later handed over to the Punjab archaeology department. Following his assassination in Dhamiak, the corpse of Muhammad Ghori was actually placed in the mausoleum of his daughter in Ghazni.
* Pakistani military named three of its medium-range ballistic missile Ghauri-I, Ghauri-II and Ghauri-III, in the memory of Mu&#x27;izz.

==Coins==
The circulation of coins from Muhammad&#x27;s court in Ghazni around 1199, confirming to the numismatic standards of the Islamic world, carried only Arabic calligraphy with the qalma and name of his sibling Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad along with his title on the obverse side of coin, whereas the reverse side of coin featured Muhammad&#x27;s name and his title along with the title of Caliphate. The paradigm of coins issued by Muhammad and Ghiyath al-Din shifted drastically from 1199 onwards to a further more orthodox ideologue with the Quranic verses on both sides. The radical shift to orthodoxy in the coinage is probably to propound their recent change of school from Karramiyya to the mainstream Hanafi and Shafi&#x27;i schools of Islam by Ghiyath al-Din and Muhammad respectively in order to embed themselves within cosmopolitan networks of the wider Islamic world and shed off their backward origin.

The coins issued by Muhammad in northern India followed the Indian standards of weight and metallic purity. The Ghurid coins in India except Bengal, continued on the same paradigm of pre-conquest with the existing Hindu iconography juxtaposed with the name of Muhammad written in Nāgarī, the script of northern Indian literate elites and not in the Arabic. Coins minted by Muhammad and his lieutenants in north India continued featuring the iconographic programme of Hindu deity Lakshmi (based on the existing pattern of Chahamanas) on one side and Muhammad&#x27;s name in the Nāgarī script on other side written in Sanskrit. Similarly in Delhi, the Ghurid circulation continued on the pre-conquest paradigm of the jital coin which had the iconography of Nandi Bull and a &quot;Chahaman horsemen&quot; juxtaposed with Muhammad&#x27;s name written &quot;Sri Muhamdada Same&quot; around the bull, and on the reverse around the horseman &quot;Shri Hammirah&quot;. The use of the Indic honorific &quot;Sri&quot; (literally &quot;radiant&quot;) and &quot;Hammirah&quot;, a Sanskritized form of the Arabic title &quot;Amir&quot;, all in Nāgarī script, are in keeping with the tradition of the jital coin as a fusion of Indic and Iranic motifs and linguistic elements throughout its history.

Finbarr Barry Flood commented on the notion of continuity of the pre-conquest arrangements in the numismatics as a pragmatic measure of Ghurids to met the economic realities in northern India. Sunil Kumar further elaborated on the basis of hoard evidences that the coins issued by Muhammad were accepted on the same scale by the local Indian financiers and bankers as the previous coins which were issued by the Rajputs, despite a period of transition (regime change) in the political milieu of northern India.

In the 2022 film &quot;Samrat Prithviraj&quot;, Manav Vij portrayed Muhammad of Ghor.

<doc id="852297" wikidata="Q3586383" url="?curid=852297" title="1985 Ontario general election">
<text>The 1985 Ontario general election was held on May 2, 1985, to elect the members of the 33rd Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Canada. The Progressive Conservatives won a plurality, but came up short of a majority.

Shortly afterward, the 42 years of PC governance in Ontario came to an end by a confidence vote defeating Premier Frank Miller&#x27;s minority government. David Peterson&#x27;s Liberals then formed a minority government with the support of Bob Rae&#x27;s New Democratic Party.

==Prelude==
Around Thanksgiving in 1984, Ontario Premier Bill Davis announced that he would be stepping down from his longtime post and as leader of the Ontario PCs in early 1985. In office since 1971, he had a string of electoral victories by pursuing a moderate agenda and by relying on the skill of the Big Blue Machine team of advisors. Davis, who remained generally popular throughout his term in office, would unveil a surprise legacy project: full funding for Ontario&#x27;s separate Catholic school system, which would become known as Bill 30. That decision was supported by both other parties but was generally unpopular, especially in the PC base.

The subsequent leadership race saw the party divide into two rough camps. The moderate and mainly-urban wing was represented by the second-place finisher, Larry Grossman. The more conservative rural faction backed the eventual victor, Frank Miller. After Miller&#x27;s victory at the convention, the party&#x27;s factions failed to reconcile, which was especially important since many moderate members of the Big Blue Machine were pushed aside.

==Election==
Despite those problems, the PCs remained far ahead in the polls, and when Miller called an election just six weeks after becoming premier, he was about 20% ahead of the Liberals. Over the campaign, however, the PC lead began to shrink as the Liberals waged a highly effective campaign. During the campaign, the separate schools question re-emerged when the Anglican prelate of Toronto, Archbishop Lewis Garnsworthy, held a news conference on the issue in which he compared Davis&#x27; methods in pushing through the reform to Adolf Hitler, saying: &quot;This is how Hitler changed education in Germany, by exactly the same process, by decree. I won&#x27;t take that back.&quot; Garnsworthy was much criticized for his remarks, but the issue was revived, which alienated the PC base, some of whom chose to stay home on election day.

The election held May 2, 1985, ended in a stalemate. The PCs emerged with a much-reduced caucus of 52 seats. The Liberals won 48 seats but won slightly more of the popular vote. The NDP held the balance of power, with 25 seats. Despite taking 14 seats from the PCs, the Liberals were somewhat disappointed, as they felt that they had their first realistic chance of winning government in recent memory. The NDP was also disappointed by the election result, as the party had been nearly tied with the Liberals for popular support for several years and had hoped to surpass them.

==Aftermath==
The incumbent PCs intended to remain in power with a minority government, as they had done on two occasions under Davis&#x27; leadership. Rae and the NDP had little interest in supporting a continuation of PC rule, while the Liberals were also more amenable to a partnership compared to in the 1970&#x27;s. Among other things, the Liberals repeatedly pointed out that (again, unlike in the previous decade) their party had won the popular vote and therefore, in their view, had at least as much of a right to govern the province as the Conservatives. The NDP began negotiations on May 13 to reach an agreement with the Liberals. Rae and Peterson signed an accord on May 29 that would see a number of NDP priorities put into law in exchange for an NDP motion of non-confidence in Miller&#x27;s government and the NDP&#x27;s support of the Liberals. The NDP agreed to support a Liberal minority government for two years during which the Liberals agreed not to call an election.

Miller, apprised of negotiations, considered a plan to address the province on television two days before the throne speech, disown funding for Catholic schools, and announce he was meeting with the Lieutenant Governor to request an election before a confidence vote could take place. Believing that the Lieutenant Governor would have to call an election if requested before the confidence vote, Miller refused to do so since he believed the party&#x27;s finances to be too fragile for a second campaign and that repudiating a key Davis policy would tear the party apart.

In what was by then a foregone conclusion, on June 18, 1985 the PC government was defeated by the passage of a motion of no confidence introduced by Rae. Lieutenant-Governor John Black Aird then asked Peterson to form a government. Privately, Aird&#x27;s actions suited Miller since even without party infighting and finances to consider, the PC&#x27;s internal polling had by then clearly indicated the voters did not want another election and that even if the Lieutenant-Governor could have been convinced to call one, the Liberals would have been likely to win in a landslide. The actions of Aird, who was appointed by former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, therefore allowed Miller to portray his relinquishing of the premiership as a grudging acquiescence that he was forced to undertake by a representative of the sovereign, who the PCs would subsequently claim had breached constitutional convention and inappropriately engaged in partisanship to elevate the second-place party to government. In any case, Miller resigned on June 26 and Peterson&#x27;s minority government was sworn in on the same day.

<doc id="852298" wikidata="Q3182381" url="?curid=852298" title="Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet (2 August 1820 – 24 August 1888) was a Scots-Quebecer politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada and the Executive Council of the Province of Canada. After Confederation, he held the offices of Solicitor General of Canada, Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance in the new federal government. In the United Kingdom, he held the offices of Receiver General of the Duchy of Cornwall and Privy Counsellor.

In 1872, he was created 1st Baronet Rose, of Montreal. His eldest son inherited the title and in 1909, his second son, Sir Charles Day Rose, was created 1st Baronet Rose of Hardwick House in his own right. His home from 1848, Rosemount, was in Montreal&#x27;s Golden Square Mile. From 1872, he lived in England at Loseley Park.

==Early life in Scotland==
John Rose was born 2 August 1820, at Gask, near Turriff, Aberdeenshire. He was the son of William Rose (b. 1792), of Gask, and Elizabeth (d. 1822), daughter of Capt. James Fyfe. John&#x27;s father, William, was a great-grandson of Hugh Rose, 16th Baron of Kilravock and Chief of Clan Rose. The estate of Gask had passed to John&#x27;s father through his ancestor, Lt.-General Alexander Forbes (d. 1672), 10th Lord Forbes. John Rose was educated at Udny Academy and King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen.

==Career==

In 1836, he immigrated to Huntingdon, Quebec, in what was then Lower Canada, where he was active in suppressing the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. He was admitted to the bar in 1842 and established a commercial practice in Montreal. From 1857 until 1867, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, and he was a member of the Executive Council from 1858 until 1861.

He was Lower Canada&#x27;s Solicitor General from 1857 to 1858 and from 1858 to 1859, and he also acted as various times as commissioner of public works and Receiver General. In 1864, the British government appointed him to the commission to settle claims under the Oregon Treaty with the United States.

Rose was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the electoral district of Huntingdon, Quebec on 20 September 1867, and was later appointed Minister of Finance in the government of John A. Macdonald. He resigned from Parliament on 29 September 1869, to return to private life with the banking firm of Morton, Rose and Co.

Rose was a delegate to the London Conference of 1866. In 1869, Rose moved to England to practise law and acted as an unofficial representative of the Canadian government. His was one of the first missions of a partly diplomatic nature which Canada ever sent abroad. He was sent partly because his was perceived as being &quot;gentlemanly&quot; enough for the world of London politics. He worked for Canada&#x27;s interests in trade and immigration, and lobbied for Canada&#x27;s viewpoint on matter of Anglo-American relations. In this function, he answered directly to the Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, since it was an informal position and was therefore not under the purview of the Governor General, meaning that communications could be kept secret from the Imperial Government. As well, Canada did not have a foreign affairs department at the time.

He also sat on a number of Royal Commissions in Britain and became a baronet in 1872, and a member of the Imperial Privy Council in 1886. Following his passing in 1888, Sir John Rose was interred at Mount Cemetery in Guildford, near the Loseley Park estate, which he had rented for some years.

==Family==

He was succeeded by his elder son Sir William Rose, 2nd Baronet. His daughter Mary Rose married Major-General Sir Stanley de Astel Calvert Clarke, K.C.V.O., C.M.G.

His Clarke granddaughters, Mrs. Edith Mary Bibby and Mrs. Baird, were two of the noted beauties of the day, and their portraits by Fildes, R.A. (former) and by Shannon (latter) were exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1896.

They were the daughters of Mrs. Edith Mary Bibby married Frank Bibby, of Sansaw, near Shrewsbury, England, 1890, and the couple had two sons and two daughters.

<text>The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) is a self-governing corporate body of the State of Hawaii created by the 1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention. It is often described as the fourth branch of government in Hawaiʻi.

OHA&#x27;s mandate is to advance the education, health, housing and economics (&quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot;) Native Hawaiians. It relies on &quot;ʻohana&quot;, &quot;moʻomeheu&quot; and &quot;ʻāina&quot; to effect change. OHA conducts research and advocacy to shape public policies. OHA works with communities to share information and build public support for Hawaiian issues.

OHA was given control over certain public lands, and acquired other land-holdings for the provision of housing, supporting agriculture, and supporting cultural institutions. The lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, which had gone through various forms of public ownership since the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom.

OHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawaiʻi through popular suffrage.

==Background==
In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. In 1921, in order to make amends for injustices associated with the overthrow and annexation, the US created the Hawaiian Homes Commissions Act which set aside 200,000 acres of land for the use of homelands for Native Hawaiians of 50% blood quantum or more. It was meant to create some compensation for forced colonization of the indigenous peoples, but in 1959 Hawaii was officially adopted as the fiftieth state of the US, with the Statehood Admissions Act defining &quot;Native Hawaiian&quot; as any person descended from the aboriginal people of Hawaii, living there prior to 1778. The Ceded lands (lands once owned by the Hawaiian kingdom monarchy) were transferred from the federal government to the State of Hawaii for the &quot;betterment of the conditions of the native Hawaiians&quot;. In 1978 the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) was created in response to the growing Hawaiian sovereignty movement of the 1970s to manage that portion of the ceded lands allotted to Hawaiian Homelands, advance the lifestyle of Native Hawaiians, preserve Hawaiian culture and protect Native Hawaiian rights. It was established during the 1978 state constitutional convention. Government funding has created programs, schools, scholarships and teaching curriculums through OHA. Many of these organizations, agencies and trusts like OHA, have had a good deal of legal issues over the years. In the US Supreme court case &quot;Rice v. Cayetano&quot;, OHA was accused of violating the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States constitution with voting provisions that were race-based. The court found for the plaintiff that OHA had violated the fifteenth amendment. OHA has also been questioned for programs and services to Hawaiians of less than the fifty percent, required blood quantum (The minimum requirement to qualify for Hawaiian Homelands).

==Board of trustees==
The Office of Hawaiian Affairs is governed by an elected board of nine trustees. The constitution provides an outline of that board, &quot;There shall be a board of trustees for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs elected by qualified voters who are Hawaiians, as provided by law. The board members shall be Hawaiians. There shall be not less than nine members of the board of trustees; provided that each of the following Islands have one representative: Oahu, Kauai, Maui, Molokai and Hawaii. The board shall select a chairperson from its members. The board of trustees provision was amended upon a United States Supreme Court ruling in the case of &quot;Rice v. Cayetano&quot; that non-Hawaiians could not be excluded from the election process, including the right of non-Hawaiians to run for such an office. Trustees are elected to a four-year term by general election of Hawaii registered voters. The board of trustees generally meets twice a month.

The constitution adds, &quot;The board of trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs shall exercise power as provided by law: to manage and administer the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the lands, natural resources, minerals and income derived from whatever sources for native Hawaiians and Hawaiians, including all income and proceeds from that pro rata portion of the trust referred to in section 4 of this article for native Hawaiians; to formulate policy relating to affairs of native Hawaiians and Hawaiians; and to exercise control over real and personal property set aside by state, federal or private sources and transferred to the board for native Hawaiians and Hawaiians. The board shall have the power to exercise control over the Office of Hawaiian Affairs through its executive officer, the administrator of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, who shall be appointed by the board. On January 30, 1989 the board of trustees agreed that salaries should be consistent with other departments of the State of Hawaii.

<text>Otherworld is an American science fiction television series that aired for eight episodes from January 26 to March 16, 1985 on CBS and was created by Roderick Taylor. Taylor gave himself a cameo role in each episode. The series was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel.

==Overview==
In the first episode, the Sterling family (Hal, June, Trace, Gina, Smith) take a tour of the interior of the Great Pyramid of Giza during a conjunction of the planets which takes place once in ten thousand years. They are mysteriously transported to a planet which may or may not also reside in a parallel universe.

The other planet, Thel, is inhabited by humans (and some androids) and divided into isolated provinces with different governments and ways of life. Travel between provinces is strictly regulated by &quot;Zone Troopers&quot; and the people of one province know nothing of the others. The province of Imar (ruled by a Praetor) appears to be the central seat of government for the whole of the planet. The pilot episode refers to &quot;territories&quot;, android creators, and &quot;wars of unification&quot;. The Church of Artificial Intelligence is the official state religion of Thel, and no conflicting ideologies are permitted. 

Having acquired an access crystal by accident, after a scuffle with a high-ranking Zone Trooper named Commander Kroll (Jonathan Banks) the Sterlings can now access all of the Zones. Kroll then pursues the Sterlings in effort to take back the crystal.

A series of Egyptian-like stone markers (obelisks), each with one eye, are supposed to mark the way to Imar, a city with beautiful buildings and a suspension bridge (the city shown in the opening credits, apparently intended to be Imar, is a photographic negative of New York City).

Each episode has the family dealing with the unfamiliar ways of life in each zone, and at the end of the episode, fleeing one zone for another, pursued by Commander Kroll who seeks the crystal, and also revenge.

==Cast==
* Sam Groom as Hal Sterling (father)
* Gretchen Corbett as June Sterling (mother)
* Tony O&#x27;Dell as Trace Sterling (teenaged son)
* Jonna Lee as Gina Sterling (teenaged daughter)
* Brandon Crane and Chris Hebert as Smith Sterling (youngest son); Crane played Smith in the pilot, which was aired as the first and fifth episodes
* Jonathan Banks as Kommander Nuveen Kroll
* Wayne Alexander as Lieutenant Zero (Kommander Kroll&#x27;s aide)

==Syndication==
The series was rerun on the USA Network, and re-shown several times on the Sci-Fi Channel. &quot;Otherworld&quot; was aired in the United Kingdom on the ITV network, except in the Thames/LWT region.

<doc id="852320" wikidata="Q5192003" url="?curid=852320" title="Cuban Boys">
<text>Cuban Boys are an English electronic group and production team, currently composed of Skreen B and Ricardo Autobahn; the band formerly also included B.L. Underwood (&quot;Blu&quot;) and Jenny McLaren (Autobahn&#x27;s sister). Their music is characterised by fast electronic beats, heavy reliance upon samples and the repetition of the name drop &quot;The Cuban Boys&quot; in the background of many of their tracks. They achieved success after being aired on John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show with sample-heavy dance tracks and cut-ups and were responsible for the UK No. 4 hit single &quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot; which was released through EMI.

==Band formation==
The Cuban Boys formed in 1998 using the Internet as a publicity and collaboration tool from the outset. After a web-only release of an anonymous dance track, &quot;Diophantus Arithmetica&quot;, with hints that it was by Noel Gallagher, they recorded &quot;Oh My God! They Killed Kenny&quot; (later retitled &quot;Kenny&quot;), which featured sampled dialogue from &quot;South Park&quot; combined with &quot;The Bump&quot; by Kenny. This was played extensively by John Peel and took the 6th position in the 1998 Festive Fifty. Following this it was released as the band&#x27;s first single. A six-track EP, &quot;Blueprint for Modernisation&quot;, followed. A track from this EP, &quot;Cuban Boy (Cuban Boys Go Boom! Mix)&quot;, went on to be used as the theme music for the BBC sitcom &quot;Still Game&quot;.

==&quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot;==
The Cuban Boys&#x27; next single, &quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot; was built on a sample used from &quot;Whistle Stop&quot; by Roger Miller which was featured in the Disney movie &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. It was first featured online as part of the Hampster Dance song on the website of the same name. It was picked up by producer Jonathan King who championed it and found a label to release it. The same sample was later used as the basis for the song &quot;Irritating Hamster&quot; by DJ Mavica, then as part of the Cuban Boys&#x27; hit (a close but noticeably different imitation of the original sample was used in the final release, as the licensing fees could not be met).

&quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot; became a No. 4 hit in the UK in December 1999, outsold only by Westlife, Cliff Richard (with &quot;The Millennium Prayer&quot;), and a re-release of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;. It also took the number one position in the 1999 Festive Fifty.

The Cuban Boys co-wrote Atomic Beat Boy with Helen Love, released as a CD single, followed by a 12-inch remix EP &#x27;Helen Love Vs Cuban Boys: Does Your Heart Go Boom&#x27;.

==&quot;Eastwood&quot;==
In 2000, the Cuban boys released their first album, &quot;Eastwood&quot;, through EMI but, despite the popularity of &quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot;, &quot;Eastwood&quot; suffered poor sales. It was not released in time to capitalise on the success of &quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot; and was given limited marketing. Some of the older tunes featuring unauthorised samples had them replaced by obvious imitations.

Following the commercial failure of &quot;Eastwood&quot;, the band were dropped by the label and left with some bitterness, later expressed through their releasing of a 7-inch cover version of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;EMI&quot;.

==Later work==
Commercially, little was heard of the band itself after &quot;Eastwood&quot;, although they released several limited release singles and EPs. The band focused mainly on Internet downloads, and made much of their early discography available free of charge from their various websites and on Myspace. All the members became involved in other projects and although the Cuban Boys never formally split up, the band ceased to be active around 2001. Its members continued to work together under various names, most notably Spray.

Following the death of John Peel in 2004, the Cuban Boys (now consisting only of Skreen B and Ricardo Autobahn) reformed to release a tribute song, &quot;The Nation Needs You&quot;, as a free download. Following this, they returned to producing individual tracks, releasing some of them as download-only or limited release CD singles. In 2008, they released their first full album since &quot;Eastwood&quot;, &quot;The Satellite Junkyard&quot; on their own record label, House of Beauty.

In 2010, the Cuban Boys released a greatest hits compilation of their singles. &quot;Art vs Commerce&quot; amounted to twenty one tracks, and was released once again on House of Beauty Records. The cover for the CD consists of a booklet with new artwork and a detailed history of the band.

Their third album, &quot;Machines&quot; was released in 2017.

<text>The Interactive Disassembler (IDA) is a disassembler for computer software which generates assembly language source code from machine-executable code. It supports a variety of executable formats for different processors and operating systems. It can also be used as a debugger for Windows PE, Mac OS X Mach-O, and Linux ELF executables. A decompiler plug-in, which generates a high level, C source code-like representation of the analysed program, is available at extra cost.

IDA is used widely in software reverse engineering, including for malware analysis and software vulnerability research. IDA&#x27;s decompiler is one of the most popular and widely used decompilation frameworks, and IDA has been called the &quot;de-facto industry standard&quot; for program disassembly and static binary analysis.

== History ==
Ilfak Guilfanov began working on IDA in 1990, and initially distributed it as a shareware application. In 1996, the Belgian company DataRescue took over the development of IDA and began to sell it as a commercial product, under the name IDA Pro.

Initial versions of IDA did not have a graphical user interface (GUI), and ran as an extended DOS, OS/2, or Windows console application. In 1999, DataRescue released the first version of IDA Pro with a GUI, IDA Pro 4.0.

In 2005, Guilfanov founded Hex-Rays to pursue the development of the Hex-Rays Decompiler IDA extension. In January 2008, Hex-Rays assumed the development and support of DataRescue&#x27;s IDA Pro.

In 2022, Hex-Rays was acquired by a group of investors led by Smartfin, a European venture capital and private equity investor. Co-investors in the acquisition included the Belgian public holding company , and the Walloon public investment firm Regional Investment Company of Wallonia (SRIW).

== Features ==
IDA disassembles a compiled program back into an assembly language representation. In addition to performing basic disassembly, IDA also automatically annotates disassembled programs with information about:

* cross-references between code and data in the program
* function locations, function stack frames, and function calling conventions
* reconstructed data types

However, the nature of disassembly precludes total accuracy, and a great deal of human intervention is necessarily required; IDA has interactive functionality to aid in improving the disassembly. A typical IDA user will begin with an automatically generated disassembly listing and then convert sections from code to data and vice versa, rename, annotate, and otherwise add information to the listing, until its functionality becomes clear.

=== Scripting ===
&quot;IDC scripts&quot; make it possible to extend the operation of the disassembler. Some helpful scripts are provided, which can serve as the basis for user written scripts. Most frequently scripts are used for extra modification of the generated code. For example, external symbol tables can be loaded thereby using the function names of the original source code.

Users have created plugins that allow other common scripting languages to be used instead of, or in addition to, IDC. IdaRUB supports Ruby and IDAPython adds support for Python. As of version 5.4, IDAPython (dependent on Python 2.5) comes preinstalled with IDA Pro.

=== Debugging ===
IDA Pro supports a number of debuggers, including:

* Remote Windows, Linux, and Mac applications (provided by Hex-Rays) allow running an executable in its native environment (presumably using a virtual machine for malware)
* GNU Debugger (gdb) is supported on Linux and OS X, as well as the native Windows debugger
* A Bochs plugin is provided for debugging simple applications (i.e., damaged UPX or mpress compacted executables)
* An Intel PIN-based debugger
* A trace replayer

== Versions ==
The latest full version of IDA Pro is available via paid annual subscription (version 9.0sp1 as of December 2024), while a less capable version (limited to x86), named IDA Free, is available for download free of cost.

== Logo ==
IDA Pro&#x27;s logo is a cropped image of Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon. The logo image is similar to a miniature painting of Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné attested to a painter in the circle of Pierre Mignard.

The original greyscale version of the logo was introduced in September 1999, with the release of IDA 4.0. Ilfak Guilfanov has stated that the logo is not a depiction of Saint Ida of Louvain.

<text>The Labour Member of Parliament for [[Tottenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Tottenham]], Bernie Grant, died on 8 April 2000, creating a [[by-election]] in his constituency.

Grant was one of the first four black MPs and the constituency was one of the centres of the London Afro-Caribbean community. However, Grant&#x27;s widow Sharon (who was white) declared her intention to seek selection and this split opinion within the local Labour Party. Both Sharon and Bernie Grant had been on the left-wing of the party whereas the leading black contender for the nomination, David Lammy, was a supporter of Tony Blair. Following a close-fought selection battle, Lammy was chosen. During the campaign, Sharon Grant made a public show of supporting his election campaign in order not to allow disunity in the Labour Party.

Polling day in the by-election was on 22 June, when Lammy comfortably retained the seat for Labour on a low turnout. Neither of the other main party candidates was able to mount a credible challenge in a seat where Labour was so strongly ahead, with Liberal Democrat candidate and future Chippenham MP Duncan Hames finishing second, and Conservative candidate and future Battersea MP Jane Ellison coming third.

All three candidates from the Labour, Conservative and Lib Dem parties in this by-election would go on to become MPs. Lammy won and became the MP for Tottenham a seat he holds to this day, Lib Dem Duncan Hames became the MP for Chippenham in 2010, losing in 2015 and Jane Ellison became the MP for Battersea in 2010, losing in 2017.

<text>The Embraer R-99 is the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) military designation of the EMB-145-RS. Various models of the aircraft have been produced to perform special mission duties, including the E99 for airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) missions, the R-99 for remote sensing, and the P-99 for maritime patrol.

Development of the R-99 began during the 1990s in response to a FAB requirement for an airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) platform, as well for the export market. The airframe is based on the ERJ 145 civil regional jet and modified with specialised mission equipment based on the mission role desired. It is typically powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce AE1 3007 turbofan engines; the military versions provide 20% more thrust than the civil version. The maiden flight of the R-99 took place in 1999; it entered operational service with the FAB two years later. 

Export customers for the type include the Hellenic Air Force, Mexican Air Force, and the Indian Air Force. Some customers have opted to buy the airframe and separately outfit it with their own electronics packages. It has been deployed in response to various events, including the Shining Path hostage crisis, the loss of Air France Flight 447, the 2011 military intervention in Libya, and the SIVAM program. During the 2010s, the FAB opted to modernise their R-99 fleet, not only extending its service life but also giving it new capabilities, such as a longer effective radar range and datalink facilities. Embraer has proposed new variants of the type, such as the armed &quot;P-99&quot; anti-submarine warfare (ASW), which is to be capable of using both torpedoes and anti-ship missiles.

== Variants ==

The &quot;R-99A/E-99/EMB 145 AEW&amp;C&quot; is an airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft, equipped with the Erieye active electronically scanned array radar from Saab Microwave Systems. During the aircraft&#x27;s development, particular attention was paid to market interest as well the specific requirements of the Brazilian Air Force (FAB). The FAB have claimed that R-99 has 95% of the capability of larger AEW&amp;C aircraft which are in service in the air forces of other nations. During 2008, the FAB redesignated the R-99A as the E-99, the factory name for the Embraer EMB-145SA (Surveillance Aircraft), a special military conversion of the passenger version of the Embraer ERJ-145LR.

The &quot;R-99B/R-99/EMB 145 MULTI INTEL&quot; is a remote sensing aircraft. It employs a synthetic aperture radar, combination electro-optical and FLIR systems as well as a multi-spectral scanner. The aircraft also possesses signal intelligence and C3I capabilities. During 2008, the FAB redesignated the R-99B as the R-99, for the Embraer EMB-145RS (Remote Sensing), a special military conversion of the passenger version of the Embraer ERJ-145LR.

The &quot;EMB 145 MP&quot; is the maritime patrol version of the EMB-145. It shares much of the same sensor suite as the R-99B, but most visibly, lacks the multi-spectral scanner and the side-looking radar. It retains many of the C3I and ELINT capabilities of the EMB-145-RS. Mexico was the launch customer for this variant.

The &quot;P-99&quot; would be the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) modification of the &quot;EMB 145 MP&quot; and would have four underwing hardpoints, which could be mounted with a variety of torpedoes and/or anti-ship missiles. No prototype with those modifications was ever flown.

During June 2019, it was announced that Embraer had partnered with the Israeli defense electronics company Elta Systems to develop the &quot;P600 AEW&quot;, which will be initially based on the Embraer Praetor 600 super-midsize business jet. In December 2020, an Embraer spokesperson stated that the P600 AEW system is likely to eventually replace the E-99 AEW; however, the Brazilian Air Force has currently committed itself to the moderization of its existing E-99 fleet, thus it is likely that the E-99M will be in service for a long time, while there were no orders placed for the P600.

== Operational history ==

During September 2003, a Brazilian R-99 was deployed on request of Peruvian authorities to locate the site where 71 hostages were being kept by the armed group Shining Path. The aircraft detected the origin of VHF signals, and thus aided the Peruvian authorities in the recovery of the hostages.

On 1 June 2009, a R-99 was deployed on the search for the missing Air France Flight 447. The fact is reported as the first real mission of a Brazilian R-99 on maritime search. The R-99 synthetic-aperture radar allowed to locate — even at night and under bad weather conditions — aircraft&#x27;s debris and victims bodies 800 km away from Fernando de Noronha Archipelago. Various pieces of debris from the lost Airbus A330-200, the largest being the empennage and a galley, were located by the R-99.

During early 2011, a Greek EMB-145-H was deployed to perform AEW missions as part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya, specifically in the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libya, in response to the Libyan Civil War.

The Indian Air Force has procured an initial three aircraft, which have been outfitted in India with an AESA radar array developed by the Electronics and Radar Development Establishment along with a datalink, identification friend or foe (IFF), radar warning receiver (RWR), and other systems. The first aircraft was delivered from Brazil on 16 August 2012 while the second followed in December 2012. The Air Force has the option to purchase another seven aircraft. Following a long &quot;technology absorption&quot; process, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has been selected as the Engineering and Life Support Agency (ELSA) for India&#x27;s DRDO&#x27;s (Defence Research and Development Organisation) EMB-145i AEW&amp;C mission systems, while Embraer will be responsible for supporting the aircraft. The platform is in service with No. 200 Squadron IAF, based at Bathinda AFS.

In Brazilian service, the E-99 and R-99 are based in Anapolis AFB. Five E-99s and three R-99s are operated by the Brazilian Air Force as part of the SIVAM program. Starting in 2013, these E-99s have undergone a modernization program that involved the updating of all onboard electronics, including a new Erieye-ER (extended range) radar, the same used on GlobalEye Detection range increased from 450 km to 723 km in the E99M version. The range of targets that can be detected ranges from vessels and large aircraft to watercraft, rubber dinghies and vehicles, as well as hovering helicopters. The first E-99M (&quot;M&quot; stands for modernized) was handed over to Brazilian Air Force on 27 November 2020.

During 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hellenic EMB-145H&#x27;s flew several daily combat missions, monitoring NATO allied airspace over Romania and Bulgaria while covering part of the Black Sea.

<text>Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) (), also called the Tehran Polytechnic, is a public technological university located in Tehran, Iran. Founded in 1958, AUT is the oldest technical university established in Iran.

It is referred to as the &#x27;Mother of Engineering Universities&#x27;. Acceptance to the university requires scoring among the top 1% of students in the Iranian University Entrance Exam, known as &#x27;Konkour&#x27;

The university was founded in 1928 as a technical academy and was further transformed into a full-fledged university by Habib Nafisi in 1956. After that, it was extended and enlarged by Dr. Mohammad Ali Mojtahedi, during the Pahlavi dynasty. Named the Tehran Polytechnic, it initially offered five engineering degrees, namely; Electrical and Electronics, Mechanical, Textile, Chemistry, and Construction and Infrastructure. Six months before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Tehran Polytechnic, was renamed after the Iranian prime minister Amir Kabir (1807–1852).

The university now has 18 science and engineering departments, dozens of research groups and laboratories, and three other affiliated centers, located in Garmsar, Bandar Abbas and Mahshahr. Around 13,400 students are enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs. AUT has more than 500 full-time academic faculty members and 550 administrative employees. The executive branch consists of four departments that receive participation from councils in planning and administering affairs.

AUT has signed agreements with international universities for research and educational collaboration. There is a joint program between AUT and the University of Birmingham.

AUT is the pioneer of sustainable development in Iran and established the Office of Sustainability in 2011. The activities of this office contribute to the AUT campus by reducing energy consumption, costs, and emissions, and also provide student coursework, volunteer opportunities for students, as well as research and education academic activities on sustainable development.
==History==
The establishment and formation of the Amirkabir University of Technology dates back to October 1956 by Eng. Habib Nafisi (). The core of the university was formed at that time under the name Tehran Polytechnic in order to expand the activities of two technical institutes: the Civil Engineering Institute and the Higher Art Center. After Habib Nafisi, the founder of Tehran polytechnic, Dr. Abedi, became the president of the university for a few months until Dr. Mohammad Ali Mojtahedi, the principal at the renowned Alborz High School, was appointed as president of the university early in 1963. Among the accomplishments of Dr. Mojtahedi is the construction of a central amphitheatre, a dining area and a sports ground as well as various faculty buildings.

The university has grown into a national center of science and engineering and its undergraduates number more than 7,000, with a further 6,400 graduate students. The university boasts 35 undergraduate majors, around 90 M.Sc. majors and 36 Ph.D. and post-doctoral programs.

==Rankings and reputation==

Amirkabir University has been consistently ranked as one of Iran&#x27;s top universities. The 2011 &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; ranked the university 301–350 in Engineering and Technology in the world. Iran&#x27;s Ministry of Science, Research and Technology ranked AUT among the Top 3 high ranked universities in the country. In Webometrics Ranking of World Universities (2012), the university also ranks among the top three highest ranked universities in Iran.

In the 2013 Shanghai Rankings Amirkabir University&#x27;s Computer Science department ranked 100–150 among World Universities. In 2014, the Shanghai ranking placed Amirkabir University&#x27;s Engineering Sciences 151–200 among World Universities. The Polymer Engineering Department of Amirkabir University of Technology is the first and most prestigious Polymer Engineering program in Iran. AUT also ranked first among Iranian universities in 2014 in the CWTS Leiden Ranking. In 2014, the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Amirkabir University of Technology&#x27;s Engineering Sciences 89 among world universities. Also, Computer Science of AUT ranked 90 among World Universities.

The 2021 edition of the QS World University Rankings placed Amirkabir University 477th in the world and second in Iran with an overall score of 24.8, behind only Sharif University of Technology which stood at 407th.

<doc id="852337" wikidata="Q1928494" url="?curid=852337" title="Education in Indonesia">
<text>Education in Indonesia falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (&quot;Kementerian Pendidikan Dasar dan Menengah&quot; or &quot;Kemendikdasmen&quot;), Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology (&quot;Kementerian Pendidikan Tinggi, Sains, dan Teknologi&quot; or &quot;Kemendikti Saintek&quot;), and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (&quot;Kementerian Agama&quot; or &quot;Kemenag&quot;). In Indonesia, all citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of six years at elementary level and three each at middle and high school levels. Islamic, Christian, Hinduism, Buddhist and Confucianism schools are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Religious Affairs.

Education is defined as a planned effort to establish a study environment and educational process so that the student may actively develop their own potential in religious and spiritual level, consciousness, personality, intelligence, behaviour and creativity to themselves, other citizens and the nation. The Constitution also notes that there are two types of education in Indonesia: formal and non-formal. Formal education is further divided into three levels: primary, secondary and tertiary education.

Schools in Indonesia are run either by the government (&quot;negeri&quot;) or private sectors (&quot;swasta&quot;). Some private schools refer to themselves as &quot;national plus schools&quot; which means that their curriculum exceeds requirements set by the Ministry of Education, especially with the use of English as medium of instruction or having an international-based curriculum instead of the national one. In Indonesia there are approximately 170,000 primary schools, 40,000 junior-secondary schools and 26,000 high schools. 84 percent of these schools are under the Ministry of Education and Culture and the remaining 16 percent under the Ministry of Religious Affairs.

==History==

===Islamic kingdoms period===
The emergence of Islamic state in Indonesia is noted by the acculturation of Islamic and Hindu-Buddhist traditions. At this time, &quot;pondok pesantren&quot;, a type of Islamic boarding school was introduced and several of them were established. The location of pesantren is mostly faraway from the hustling crowd of the city, resembling the location of Karsyan.

===Dutch colonial period===
Elementary education was introduced by the Dutch in Indonesia during the colonial era. The Dutch education system are query strings of educational branches that were based on social status of the colony&#x27;s population, with the best available institution reserved for the European population.

In 1870, with the growth of Dutch Ethical Policy formulated by Conrad Theodor van Deventer, some of these Dutch-founded schools opened the doors for pribumi (lit. native Indonesians). They were called &quot;Sekolah Rakjat&quot; (lit. folk school), the embryo of what is called &quot;Sekolah Dasar&quot; (lit. elementary school) today. In 1871 the Dutch parliament adopted a new education law that sought to uniform the highly scattered and diversified indigenous education systems across the archipelago, and expand the number of teacher training schools under the supervision of the colonial administration. The budget for public schooling was raised in steps from ca. 300,000 guilders in 1864 to roughly 3 million guilders by the early 1890s. Most often, however, the education development were starved of funding, because many Dutch politicians feared expanding education would eventually lead to anti-colonial sentiment. Funding for education only counted for 6% of the total expenditure of the colonial budget in the 1920s. The number of government and private primary schools for natives had increased to 3,108 and the libraries to 3,000 by 1930. However, spending sharply declined after the economic depression in 1930.

The Dutch introduced a system of formal education for the local population of Indonesia, although this was restricted to certain privileged children. The schools for the European were modeled after the education system in Netherlands itself and required proficiency in Dutch. The Dutch language was also needed for higher education enrollment. The elite native/Chinese population who lack Dutch language skills could enroll in either Dutch Native or Chinese schools. The schools were arranged in the following levels:
*ELS (&quot;Dutch: Europeesche Lagereschool&quot; lit. &quot;European Low School&quot;) – primary school for Europeans
*HSS (&quot;Dutch: Hollandsch-Schakelschool&quot; lit. &quot;Dutch-Switch School&quot;)
*HIS (&quot;Dutch: Hollandsch-Inlandscheschool&quot; lit. &quot;Dutch-Native School&quot;) – primary school for natives
*HCS (&quot;Dutch: Hollandsch-Chinescheschool&quot; lit. &quot;Dutch-Chinese School&quot;) - primary school for Chinese
*MULO (&quot;Dutch: Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs&quot; lit. &quot;More Advanced Low Education&quot;) – middle school
*AMS (&quot;Dutch: Algemene Middelbareschool&quot; lit. &quot;General Middle School&quot;) – high school or college
*HBS (&quot;Dutch: Hogere Burgerschool&quot; lit. &quot;Higher Citizen School&quot;) – pre-university


For the population in rural areas, the Dutch created the &quot;Desa Schools&quot; or village schools system which aimed to spread literacy among the native population. These schools provide two or three years training of vernacular subjects (reading, writing, ciphering, hygiene, animals and plants, etc.) and served as cheaper alternative schools. These village schools, however, received much less funding than the privileged European schools, thus the quality of education provided is often lacking. Despite its flaws, the number of village schools reached 17,695 by 1930. The rest of the rural education were left to the work of Christian missionary, which are considered more cost-efficient.

The segregation between Dutch and Indonesian in education pushed several Indonesian figures to start educational institutions for local people. Arab Indonesians founded Jamiat Kheir in 1905, Ahmad Dahlan founded Muhammadiyah in November 1912, and Ki Hajar Dewantara founded Taman Siswa in July 1922 to emancipate the native population. Pesantrens (Islamic schools) were also mushrooming rapidly during this period.

During the colonial period there was a large gap between the educated male and female population. In 1920, on the island of Java and Madura out of the 6.5% literate male population, only 0.5% of the female native population are literate. Similar phenomenon can be observed on the &#x27;Foreign Orientals&#x27; (Arabs and Chinese), with 26.5% literate male population and only 8.5% literate females out of the total population. In the outer islands beyond Java the difference between literate male and female population are 12% and 3% out of the population respectively. Inspired by a Javanese-born aristocrat Kartini who died young at the age of 25, the Van Deventer family worked to increase female involvement in education and received support from the Dutch government — eventually leading to foundation of Kartini Schools in 1911.

The Dutch colonial government established universities and colleges for native Indonesian on the island of Java. Before founding the Bandung Institute of Technology in 1920, there was no university-level education in the country; students had to go abroad (mainly to Netherlands) to receive it. Most of these universities have become the country&#x27;s top educational institution as of today. These institutions are as follow:
*&quot;School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen&quot; or STOVIA, a medical university which later become &quot;Geneeskundige Hogeschool&quot; in Batavia.
*&quot;Nederland-Indische Artsen School&quot; or NIAS, a medical school in Soerabaja.
*&quot;Rechts-Hoge-School&quot;, a law school in Weltevreden, Batavia.
*&quot;De Technische Hoge-School&quot;, or THS, a technic school in Bandoeng and the first full-fledged university in the country (opened in 1920).
*&quot;Middelbare Landbouw-school&quot;, an agriculture college which later become &quot;Landbouwkundige Faculteit&quot; in Buitenzorg
*&quot;Opleiding-School voor Inlandsche Ambtenaren&quot; or OSVIA, colleges for training native civil servants.
*&quot;Hollandsche-Indische Kweek-school&quot;, colleges for training teachers.

By the 1930s, the Dutch had introduced limited formal education to nearly every province of the Dutch East Indies, although by this period only 7.4% of the population were literate in 1931 and 2% were fluent in Dutch. Around the outer islands beyond Java, to meet demand of schooling, the Dutch government relied heavily on missionary schools that mostly provide basic and moral education.

===Japanese occupation===

During the Japanese occupation in World War II, the operations of the Dutch education system were consolidated into a single operation that parallel the Japanese education system. The Japanese occupation marked the deterioration of education in Indonesia, as schools were organized with the goal of creating Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere of influence. As a result, schools began training in military and physical drill that were anti-West oriented. It included indoctrination of Japanese culture and history. Students were required to raise the Japanese flag and bow to the Emperor every morning. The Japanese made schools less stratified; despite this, enrollment had shrunk by 30% for primary education and 90% for secondary education by 1945.

===Post independence===

Under the Japanese and Dutch occupation, most of the educational institutions were created to support the needs of the occupying power. There were very few efforts to promote the intellectual advancement of the indigenous population. After Indonesia declared its independence in 1945, the surviving education system was fragile and unorganized. In addition there was a shortage of teachers, as most of them had been Dutch or Japanese. Very few Indonesians had experience in managing schools.

Eager to address the neglect of focused education on native population, the first government of Indonesia had to create a system from scratch and reject the colonial European system. An Act declared in the 1945 constitution as Chapter 8, article 31, clause 1 that &quot;every citizen has the right for education&quot;. The Ministry of Education, Instruction and Culture was founded with its first minister, Soewandi. The new institution sought to create an education that is anti-discriminatory, -elitist, and -capitalist to promote nationalism of the new republic of Indonesia. It was also decided that religion deserved a proper place and attention under the new republic, resulting in an increased support for Pesantren and Islamic Madrasah.

In 1961, 46.7% of the population were literate.

==Early education==
Pre-school education in Indonesia is covered under PAUD (&quot;Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini&quot;, lit. Early Age Education) that covers &quot;Taman Bermain&quot; (playgroup) and &quot;Taman Kanak-Kanak&quot; (kindergarten, abbreviated TK). PAUD is under direct supervision and coverage of Directorate of Early Age Education Development (Direktorat Pengembangan Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini).

From the age of 2, parents send their children to &quot;Taman Bermain&quot;. From the age of 4, they attend &quot;Taman Kanak-Kanak&quot;. Most TKs arrange the classes into two grades: A and B, which are informally called &quot;kelas nol kecil&quot; (little zero grade) and &quot;kelas nol besar&quot; (big zero grade) respectively. While this level of education is not compulsory, it is aimed to prepare children for primary schooling. Of the 49,000 kindergartens in Indonesia, 99.35% are privately operated. The kindergarten years are usually divided into &quot;Class A&quot; and &quot;Class B&quot; with students spending a year in each class.

==Public primary and secondary education==

Indonesians are required to attend 12 years of school. Students must go to school five days a week (some schools still employ 6 school days a week) from 07:30 a.m. (sometimes as early as 06.25 a.m. in some schools) until 15.30 p.m. Students can choose between state-run, nonsectarian public schools supervised by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Kemendikbudristek) or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools supervised and financed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Students can choose to participate in extracurricular activities provided by the school such as sports, arts, or religious studies. However, although 86.1 percent of the Indonesian population is registered as Muslim, according to the 2000 census only 15 percent of school-age individuals attended religious schools. Overall enrollment figures are slightly higher for girls than boys and much higher in Java than the rest of Indonesia.

A central goal of the national education system is to impart secular wisdom about the world and to instruct children in the principles of participation in the modern nation-state, its bureaucracies, and its moral and ideological foundations. Beginning under Guided Democracy (1959–65) and strengthened in the New Order after 1975, a key feature of the national curriculum — was the case for other national institutions — has been instruction in the Pancasila. Children age six and older learned by rote its five principles — belief in one God, humanitarianism, national unity, democracy, and social justice — and were instructed daily to apply the meanings of this key national symbol to their lives. But with the end of the New Order in 1998 and the beginning of the campaign to decentralise the national government, provincial and district-level administrators obtained increasing autonomy in determining the content of schooling, and Pancasila began to play a diminishing role in the curriculum.

A style of pedagogy prevails inside public-school classrooms that emphasises rote learning and deference to the authority of the teacher. Although the youngest children are sometimes allowed to use their local language, by the third year of primary school nearly all instruction is conducted in Indonesian. Teachers customarily do not ask questions of individual students; rather, a standard teaching technique is to narrate a historical event or to describe a mathematical problem, pausing at key junctures to allow the students to call out responses that &quot;fill in the blanks&quot;. By not identifying individual problems of students and retaining an emotionally distanced demeanor, teachers are said to show themselves to be patient, which is considered admirable.

Children ages 6–12 attend primary school, called Sekolah Dasar (SD). As of 2014, most elementary schools are government-operated public schools, accounting for 90.29% of all elementary schools in Indonesia. Students spend six years in primary school, though some schools offer an accelerated learning program in which students who perform well can complete the level in five years.

Three years of junior high school (Sekolah Menengah Pertama, or SMP) follows elementary school. Some schools offer an accelerated learning program in which students who perform well can complete the level in two years.

There are academic and vocational junior high schools that lead to senior-level diplomas. There are also &quot;domestic science&quot; junior high schools for girls.

After completion, they may attend three years of high school (Sekolah Menengah Atas or SMA). Some high schools offer an accelerated learning program so students who perform well can complete their level in two years. Besides high school, students can choose among 47 programmes of vocational and pre-professional high school (Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan or SMK), divided in the following fields: technology and engineering, health, arts, craft and tourism, information and communication technologies, agro-business and agro-technology, business management. Each requires three years of study. At the senior high school level, three-year agricultural, veterinary, and forestry schools are open to students who have graduated from an academic junior high school.

Special schools at the junior and senior levels teach hotel management, legal clerking, plastic arts, and music.

Students with disabilities/special needs may opt to be enrolled in a separate school from the mainstream called &quot;Sekolah Luar Biasa&quot; (SLB, lit. Extraordinary School).

The Indonesian education system is the fourth largest in the world with more than 50 million students, 3 million teachers, 300,000 schools. Primary to high school level is compulsory. Primary and middle school is free, while in high school, there are small fees. The completion rate for Indonesian primary schools is high. In 2018, the net enrollment rate for primary, middle school, and high school each is 93.5%, 78.84%, and 60.67%. The tertiary-education participation is low at 36.31%. In 2011, the survival rate for primary, middle, and high school as the following numbers: 95.3%, 97.68%, and 96.8%. The higher the percentage of survival rate means that fewer students at certain education level who drop out. Although the Indonesian government has achieved significant improvement in the education sector, there are still many challenges that should be addressed, including funding, management, equity, and education quality.

Teacher-training programs are varied and gradually being upgraded. For example, in the 1950s anyone completing a teacher-training program at the junior high school level could obtain a teacher&#x27;s certificate. Since the 1970s, however, primary-school teachers have been required to have graduated from a senior high school for teachers, and teachers of higher grades have been required to have completed a university-level education course. Remuneration for primary- and secondary-school teachers, although low, compares favourably with that in other Asian countries such as Malaysia, India, and Thailand. The student–teacher ratio is 17 to 1 and 15.2 to 1, respectively, for primary and secondary schools in 2018; that same year, the overall averages for East Asia &amp; Pacific countries were 17.5 to 1 and 14.8 to 1, respectively.

By 2008, the staff shortage in Indonesia&#x27;s schools was no longer as acute as in the 1980s, but serious difficulties remain, particularly in the areas of teacher salaries, teacher certification, and finding qualified personnel. In many remote areas of the outer islands, in particular, there is a severe shortage of qualified teachers, and some villages have school buildings but no teachers, books, or supplies. Providing textbooks and other school equipment to Indonesia&#x27;s 37 million schoolchildren throughout the far-flung archipelago continues to be a significant problem as well, especially in more remote areas.

===School grades===
The school year is divided into two semesters. The first commences in July and ends in December while the latter commences in January and ends in June.

==Islamic schools==

There are three types of Islamic schools in Indonesia: &quot;pesantren&quot;, &quot;madrasah&quot;, and &quot;sekolah islam&quot;. &quot;Pesantren&quot; can be small with just a few teachers and students to quite large with dozens of teachers and hundreds of students. &quot;Pesantren&quot; are led by hereditary kyais, who lead the school and have religious authority. &quot;Madrasah&quot; vary in their ideological foundations and vary in the provision of secular and religious content. &quot;Sekolah Islam&quot; use the Ministry of Education and Culture&#x27;s secular curriculum and add their own Islamic curricula.

The secular and nationalist emphasis in public schools has been resisted by some of the Muslim majority. A distinct and vocal minority of these Muslims prefer to place their children in a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) or Islamic school. Usually found in rural areas and directed by a Muslim scholar, pesantren are attended by young people seeking a detailed understanding of the Quran, the Arabic language, sharia, and Muslim traditions and history, as well as more modern subjects such as English, mathematics, and geography. Students can enter and leave the pesantren any time of the year, and the studies are not organized as a progression of courses leading to graduation.

Although the chief aim of pesantren is to produce good Muslims, they do not share a single stance toward Islam or a position on secularism. Some pesantren emphasise the autonomy of modern students to think for themselves and to interpret scripture and modern knowledge in a way that is consistent with the teachings of Islam. Others are more traditional and stress the importance of following the wisdom of elders, including their teachings on science, religion, and family life. Although the terrorist bombings in Kuta, Bali, in 2002 raised suspicions about whether pesantren promote extremist views, the majority of these schools in Indonesia are theologically moderate, reflecting the views of the Indonesian population as a whole. For those who opt for a pesantren education, a sixth-grade equivalency certificate is available after successful completion of a state test.

For students to adapt to life in the modern nation-state, in the 1970s the Muslim-dominated Department of Religion (now the Ministry of Religious Affairs) advocated the spread of a newer variety of Muslim school: the &quot;madrassa&quot;. This kind of school integrates religious subjects from the pesantren with secular subjects from the Western-style public-education system. Although in general the public believes that Islamic schools offer lower-quality education, among Islamic schools a madrassa is ranked lower than a pesantren.

&quot;Raudhatul Athfal&quot; (RA) is the Islamic pre-schooling equivalent of TK, &quot;Madrasah Ibtidaiyah&quot; (MI) is the Islamic schooling equivalent of SD, &quot;Madrasah Tsanawiyah&quot; (MTs) is the Islamic schooling equivalent of SMP. &quot;Madrasah Aliyah&quot; (MA) is the Islamic schooling equivalent of SMA while &quot;Madrasah Aliyah Kejuruan&quot; (MAK) is the equivalent of SMK.

==Higher education==
Higher education in Indonesia is offered by several types of institutions depends on the nature of academic education, vocational education, and professional education.

Since 2012, the Indonesian education system has been organized on Indonesian National Qualification Framework (Indonesian: &quot;Kerangka Kerja Nasional Indonesia&quot;, KKNI).

<text>PressPlay (stylised press&quot;play&quot; not be confused with Pressplay.app a streaming guide for movies and tv-shows) was the name of an online music store that operated from December 2001 until March 2003. It was created as a joint venture between Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment in response to the popularity of Napster.

Universal and Sony created PressPlay rather than joining RealNetworks&#x27; online service MusicNet, which had signed BMG, EMI and AOL Time Warner. It was originally announced under the name Duet in May 2001 and launched as PressPlay in December 2001.

Apart from Universal and Sony, the service carried some music from BMG, EMI and Warner, as well as various independent labels. It was branded for multiple services, most notably Yahoo.com.

The service allowed users 500 low-quality audio streams in DRMed Windows Media Audio, 50 song downloads and 10 songs burnt to CD, for $15 a month. It could also build and store users&#x27; playlists. Not every song could be downloaded, and users could not burn more than two tracks from the same artist to CD. Downloads expired after 30 days. Songs could not be transferred to a portable player.

Artists were paid around $0.0023 (0.23 of a cent) per song. Many artists, outraged at this rate and stating their songs were being used without proper permission, sought to have their music removed from the service unless they were paid a licensing fee rather than a CD-style royalty.

Even before it was launched, the restrictions meant the service was not attractive to consumers. PressPlay and rival MusicNet were given the shared 9th place in PC World&#x27;s 2006 list of the &quot;25 Worst Tech Products of All Time&quot;, which stated that &quot;the services&#x27; stunningly brain-dead features showed that the record companies still didn&#x27;t get it&quot;.

Universal and Sony had also licensed at least a portion of their catalog to other, more successful online music stores such as
Streamwaves&#x27; Christian music service HigherWaves, FullAudio and Streamwaves&#x27; full product.

Roxio acquired the service on May 19, 2003, and used it as a base to launch their paid music service under the brand name Napster, and in 2004, Sony launched its Sony Connect service.

The disastrous history of Pressplay was later detailed in &quot;How Music Got Free&quot; by Stephen Witt, from the viewpoint of Universal Music CEO Doug Morris.

<text>The Air Assault Badge is awarded by the U.S. Army for successful completion of the Air Assault School. The course includes three phases of instruction involving U.S. Army rotary wing aircraft: combat air assault operations; rigging and slingloading operations; and rappelling from a helicopter.

According to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry, &quot;The Air Assault Badge was approved by the Chief of Staff, Army, on 18 January 1978, for Army-wide wear by individuals who successfully completed Air Assault training after 1 April 1974. The badge had previously been approved as the Airmobile Badge authorized for local wear by the Commander of the 101st Airborne Division, effective 1 April 1974.&quot; The division had been reorganized from parachute to airmobile in mid-1968 in Vietnam and designated the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile). The parenthetical designation changed to Air Assault on 4 October 1974 and the name of the badge was likewise changed.

==History==
On 7 February 1963, the colors of the 11th Airborne Division were reactivated at Fort Benning, GA, as the 11th Air Assault Division (Test). The 11th was a small unit, never intended for deployable status, and used to test the airmobile concept then under development. Units of the 2d Infantry Division, also located at Fort Benning, were “borrowed” for large-scale airmobile tests and maneuvers.

An earlier Air Assault Badge, pictured on the right, was worn in the early 1960s by troops of 11th who qualified for it by making three helicopter rappels from and three from . Soldiers were also required to be knowledgeable of aircraft safety procedures; familiar with aircraft orientation; proficient in hand and arm signals and combat assault operations; able to prepare, inspect and rig equipment for external sling loads; and able to lash down equipment inside helicopters. The badge was first awarded in early 1964 and was only authorized for wear by soldiers within the 11th, as it was a division award and not authorized for Army-wide wear by the Department of the Army.

On 30 June 1965 the 11th Air Assault Division was inactivated and its assets merged with the 2d Infantry Division to become the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). The colors of the 2d Infantry Division were sent to Korea where the existing 1st Cavalry Division was reflagged as 2d Infantry Division and the colors of the 1st Cavalry Division sent to Fort Benning. Shortly thereafter the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) was sent to Vietnam.

Maj. Jack R. Rickman is credited with the design of the Air Assault Badge when, in 1971, he was on tour with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam. He thought little of the outcome of the design assignment, given to him by a division operations officer, which the Army adopted officially in January 1978. He was made aware of his part in the badge design years later when he recognized his design work seen in a published photograph. He never earned a badge himself.

The design was influenced by the Parachutist Badge worn when the division was on jump status, as well as the Glider Badge worn by glider units during World War II. Charles Bloodworth, a pathfinder officer in the 101st during the early 1970s, wrote, &quot;Locally designed and fabricated, the badge was deliberately crafted to mimic the glider wings of WWII. The nose of the Huey took the place of the glider body, and the horizontal rotor blade was the spitting image of the glider wing.&quot; 

The 101st returned from Vietnam to Fort Campbell, Kentucky and the 173rd Airborne Brigade was inactivated with its assets transferred to form the division&#x27;s 3rd Brigade, at the time was on jump status. The remainder of the division was organized as Airmobile. In February 1974, Major General Sidney B. Berry, Commanding General, signed Division General Order 179 authorizing the wearing of the Airmobile Badge effective 1 April 1974, the same date that the 3rd Brigade would terminate its jump status.

Bloodworth describes the transition of the post-war division to fully Air Assault and the adoption of the Air Assault Badge in his article titled, &quot;History of the 101st (Post-Vietnam).&quot;

==Training==

Currently, in order for a US servicemember to be awarded the Air Assault Badge, they must first complete a 10 1/2-day course of instruction at the US Army Air Assault School. This course consists of the following phases of training:
* Day Zero: Candidates must successfully complete an obstacle course and a two-mile run before they are officially considered “Air Assault Students.”
* Day One: Candidates will undergo a six-mile march, followed by a strict inspection.
* Combat Assault Phase: During this three-day phase, candidates will learn aircraft safety and orientation, along with the principles of aero-medical evacuation, pathfinder operations, and combat assault operations among several other topics. Soldiers will be given a written and “hands-on” test following this phase.
* Slingload Operations: During the second three-day phase of Air Assault School, candidates will learn how to rig equipment onto rotary aircraft with a sling, an operation that generally requires the loading soldier to hook a tether to the underbelly of a helicopter hovering just a few feet above the ground. Typical loads can range anywhere from 1,000 to 8,000 pounds. Trainees must pass a written and hands-on test before moving to the next phase.
* Rappelling Phase: In the third and final three-day phase of Air Assault training, soldiers receive basic instruction on ground and aircraft rappelling procedures. By the end of the phase, trainees must complete two rappels from a 34-foot tower and two rappels from a UH-60, hovering at 70–90 feet.
* Graduation Day: Soldiers must complete a 12-mile foot march in full gear plus a rucksack in less than three hours. Graduates are awarded the Air Assault Badge and the &quot;2B&quot; Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) upon completion of the march.

===Training locations===
Formal air assault training has been conducted at Fort Campbell, Kentucky by the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) since the Air Assault School was formed in 1974. During the early stages of the occupation of Iraq in late 2003, the division conducted a course in-theater to maintain Air Assault proficiency.

==Wearing of the badge==
===Army Wear===

The wearing of the Air Assault Badge on Army uniforms is governed by Department of the Army Pamphlet (DA PAM) 670-1, &quot;Guide to the Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia.&quot; Under this DA PAM, the Air Assault Badge is defined as a Group 4 precedence special skill badge which governs its wear in relation to other combat and special skill badges and tabs. The basic eligibility criteria for the badge consist of satisfactory completion of an air assault training course in accordance with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command&#x27;s standardized Air Assault Core Program of Instruction or completion of a standard Air Assault Course while assigned or attached to the 101st Airborne Division since 1 April 1974.

To be awarded an honorary Air Assault Badge, veterans must have been assigned or attached to a combat unit in the 101st Airborne Division, 101st Air Cavalry Division, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile), or 1st Cavalry Division during the period from 1965 through 1972, serving in direct combat in a combat arms duty military occupational specialty, or while in a combat support military operational specialty assigned to a 101st or 1st Cavalry Division combat unit in Vietnam.

====Airborne background trimmings====

When the 101st Airborne Division was converted to air assault, it carried over the wear of the cloth airborne background trimmings (ovals) from its time as an active airborne unit. According to DR 670-1, airborne background trimmings are authorized for organizations designated (by structure, equipment and mission) &quot;Airborne&quot; or &quot;Air Assault&quot; by Headquarters, Department of the Army. The following are airborne background trimmings currently authorized for wear behind the Air Assault Badge:

Background trimmings have been denied by the US Army&#x27;s Institute of Heraldry to other units with a parenthetical designation of “Air Assault” such as the California Army National Guard&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry Regiment. The rationale given by The Institute of Heraldry was that units outside of the 101st Airborne Division did not have an &quot;air assault mission.&quot; The reason various ARNG units were organized according to the Air Assault Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE) was because such units were authorized fewer personnel and less equipment, thus making them less expensive to operate and maintain. They were not organized with actual air assault missions in mind.

===Department of the Air Force wear===

All of the military services can send personnel to the U.S. Army&#x27;s Air Assault Schools, but only the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Space Force allows for the Air Assault Badge to be worn on their uniforms. For several decades only U.S. Air Force personnel attached to the 101st Airborne Division were allowed to wear the badge and only while assigned, paralleling U.S. Army policy from 1974 to 1978 for Army soldiers. However, as of the 17 January 2014 update to uniform instructions, Department of Air Force personnel are authorized to wear the Air Assault Badge along with other special skill badges they have earned through other uniformed services.

===Maritime services wear===
The Air Assault Badge is not authorized for wear on uniforms of the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps. With the proper documentation filed in a unit&#x27;s administrative department, prior U.S. Army service members who have enlisted or commissioned in the U.S. Coast Guard may wear the Air Assault Badge.

<text>The Capital Region (, ) was the administrative name of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg and the counties of Frederiksborg, Copenhagen, and Roskilde. It was replaced by the Capital Region of Denmark () as an administrative region on 1 January 2007 as part of the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform.

The new region includes the island of Bornholm (in the Baltic Sea 100 nautical miles from Copenhagen), and excludes the southwestern parts of Greater Copenhagen that were covered by Roskilde County. These southwestern areas are instead included in Region Zealand ().

==Composition==
In 2007 the Capital Region had a population of 1,834,492 and an area of 2,861.41 km2

The area consisted of:


== Today ==
The same area has (31 December 2012) 1,937,450 inhabitants (680 inhabitants/km2)
However the Capital Region has been expanded and Stevns Municipality has been added.
That area is 3030 km2 and has 1,957,611 inhabitants (646 inhabitants/km2).

The Capital Region is still in use at several levels:

* Local public traffic, ticket fare zones (Metro, S-train, Local trains, Regional trains within the area, busses etc.) 
* Television – three regional TV-channels broadcast over the entire area
* The area is a region for &quot;Vejdirektoratet&quot;, the Danish motorway &amp; road maintenance authority
* It is also a region of the Danish national rail, DSB. If for instance buying a ticket in Jutland, the ticket is valid for any station within the Capital Region.
* Public identification, people that live within its boundaries usually identify themselves as inhabitants of the Capital Region.

<text>The Minister of Public Works was a position in the Cabinet of Canada who oversaw the public works portfolio of the federal government.

The office was established upon Confederation (1 July 1867) by Order-in-Council, and was given statutory basis later that year on December 21, through Statute 31 Victoria, c. 12. On 12 July 1996, as part of substantial governmental reorganization under the leadership of Jean Chrétien, the position was merged with that of the Minister of Supply and Services to create the office of Minister of Public Works and Government Services.

<text>Planetfall is a science fiction themed interactive fiction video game written by Steve Meretzky, and published in 1983 as the eighth game from Infocom. The original release was for Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, TRS-80, and IBM PC compatibles (both as a self-booting disk and for MS-DOS). Atari ST and Commodore 64 versions were released in 1985. A version for CP/M was also released. &quot;Planetfall&quot; was Meretzky&#x27;s first published game, and it proved one of his most popular works and a best-seller for Infocom. It was one of five top-selling games to be re-released in Solid Gold versions with in-game hints. &quot;Planetfall&quot; uses the Z-machine originally developed for &quot;Zork&quot; and was added as a bonus to the &quot;Zork Anthology&quot;.

The word &quot;planetfall&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;planet&quot; and &quot;landfall&quot;, and occasionally used in science fiction to that effect. The book &quot;Planetfall&quot; written by Arthur Byron Cover, uses the game image on the cover, and is marketed &quot;In the bestselling tradition of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.&quot; A sequel, &quot;Stationfall&quot;, was released in 1987.

==Plot==

The game starts with the user assuming the role of a lowly Ensign Seventh Class on the &quot;S.P.S. Feinstein&quot;, a starship of the Stellar Patrol. Overbearing superior Ensign First Class Blather assigns the player to mop decks, not exactly the glorious adventures promised by the recruiters on Gallium. In the diary provided in the &quot;feelies&quot;, the player is on the verge of deserting ship. But a sudden series of explosions aboard the ship sends the player scrambling for an escape pod, which eventually crash-lands on a nearby planet. There are signs of civilization, but curiously no traces of the beings that once lived there. Eventually encountering a helpful but childlike robot named Floyd, the player must unravel the mysteries of the single deserted structure on the planet, Resida, and find a way to get back home. As the fate of the planet&#x27;s former inhabitants becomes clearer, a time limit also imposes itself.

The adventurer does not remain on &quot;S.P.S. Feinstein&quot; for long. Talking to the alien ambassador and performing the assigned task of scrubbing the floor don&#x27;t accomplish much. Wandering to other parts of the ship merits demerits from Blather and an ultimately fatal run-in with the Brig unless the player returns to work. Soon, an explosion occurs and an escape pod door opens. The pod safety netting breaks the player&#x27;s fall and an escape kit is produced, which proves critical to survival. With great exertion, the adventurer swims out of the pod and climbs up to a mysterious deserted base.

By putting together various clues, slowly the player realizes that the nearly uninhabited island is in fact one of the last remaining landmasses on a planet on the verge of destruction. A deadly plague for which no cure existed threatened to kill off all inhabitants of the world. The inhabitants initiated a planetwide project to place everyone under suspended animation while automated systems of robots and computers worked towards finding a cure. Once the cure was found, the inhabitants could be revived.

By the time the player arrives, it is clear that the project is on the edge of success, but the planet itself is on the verge of destruction. The planetary orbit has decayed, leading to massive global warming and an enormous rise in the oceanic levels. Meteorites bombard the planet with ferocious intensity, and the project to find a cure for the plague is itself threatened by the failure of the main computer and repair systems. Adding to the challenge is the fact that some of the puzzles are not solvable. Determining which ones are impossible and avoiding even trying is essential.

Early on in the game, the player finds what at first appears to be the only remaining inhabitant of the island: Floyd, a childish yet endearing robot. He is both a constant source of comic relief (e.g. &quot;Oh, boy! Are we going to try something dangerous?&quot; when the player saves the game in his presence), and also critical in advancing the plotline. Once Floyd realizes that the ProjCon repair robot (aptly named Achilles) is non-functional, and that the Project is close to completion, he performs the ultimate sacrifice and gives his life to retrieve the vital Miniaturization Card from the Bio-lab (the mutants within kill the player if he tries to get it himself). As Floyd lies dying, the player sings the &quot;Ballad of the Starcrossed Miner&quot; to him (itself an allusion to the earlier Infocom game &quot;Starcross&quot;).

The adventurer then uses the Miniaturization Booth to access malfunctioning Relay Station #384 and repairs the main computer by removing an offending speck of dust with a laser. After defeating a giant microbe, the adventurer is informed that the primary Miniaturization Booth is malfunctioning and is rerouted to the Auxiliary Booth. Unfortunately, this puts a room full of mutants between the player and the endgame.

With a biomask and the help of the Laboratory&#x27;s poison gas system, the player makes it through the Bio-lab but emerges with the mutants on his tail. However, the adventurer makes it to the Cryo-Elevator which is hidden behind a mural. The elevator takes the adventurer to a secret room where the survivors of the infection were cryogenically frozen, just as the entire facility staff is reanimated by the antidote discovered by the ProjCon Computer. The adventurer is proclaimed a hero, Floyd is repaired, and Blather is demoted.

There are 41 ways to die. The adventurer must sleep in a Dormitory each night and eat when hungry. Taking more than a few days causes the adventurer to succumb to the infection which apparently has ravaged the facility unless the antidote is obtained at the underground site. But even taking the antidote only buys a little time as the planet is nearing its sun. To achieve the optimum ending, the adventurer also must repair the three Planetary systems: the Communications System, the Planetary Defense System, and the Course Control System.

==Release==
The game included the following physical items:
#A Stellar Patrol &quot;Special Assignment Task Force&quot; ID card (about the size and shape of a credit card). The ID number printed on the card is the telephone number of MIT&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Tech&quot;, which was in the way of a prank by Meretzky.
#Three interstellar postcards
#A Stellar Patrol recruiting manual, &quot;Today&#x27;s Stellar Patrol: Boldly Going Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot;
#A short diary kept by the player&#x27;s character (in the Solid Gold release, an in-game object included in the player&#x27;s starting inventory rather than the packaging)

==Reception==
&quot;Softline&quot; stated that &quot;the puzzles are good; the character of Floyd is great&quot;. The magazine stated that the &quot;game is excellent&quot;, but criticized the ending as &quot;unabashed adolescent wish fulfillment ... more like a fairy tale&quot;. In 1984 the magazine&#x27;s readers named the game the tenth most-popular Apple program of 1983. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called Floyd&#x27;s role as sidekick &quot;unique&quot; and hoped that future games would add such innovations. It stated that &quot;Planetfall&quot; was &quot;another excellent adventure&quot; for text-adventure fans, and a good place to start for those new to interactive fiction. &quot;Creative Computing&quot; wrote that &quot;Planetfall&quot; &quot;is as remarkable, funny, perplexing, and entertaining a game as you are likely to find anywhere.&quot; It praised Floyd as &quot;the most imaginative and cleverly written part of the entire game, Floyd, besides being hysterically funny through most of the adventure, evokes in the player of Planetfall authentic feelings of affection and attachment&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; recommended the game as among the best adventures for the Atari 8-bit.

Steve Meretzky stated that Floyd &quot;was the result of research into how an artificially intelligent mind might work&quot;. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 1984 described the robot as &quot;the most popular Infocom character&quot;. &quot;Planetfall&quot; has been described as &quot;still lovingly remembered&quot;, and parts have been described as &quot;transcendent&quot;, including Floyd&#x27;s death. Meretzky claims that &quot;numerous players&quot; have told him that they cried over the death of Floyd. &quot;Softline&quot; wrote, &quot;You don&#x27;t feel like this very often. Maybe after you&#x27;ve read &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;. Maybe when they shot Bambi&#x27;s mother. Maybe when Raskolnikov got religion in the Siberian slave labor camp. But this scene is from a computer game. A game!&quot; A game developers round table on GEnie concluded that Floyd&#x27;s death was a sad moment that could make someone cry.
Floyd&#x27;s death has been described as directly evoking the player&#x27;s emotions because the story and gameplay are aligned.
The death of Floyd has been described as changing the game to an &quot;evocative theatrical experience&quot; after which &quot;the player feels lonely and bereaved.&quot;
The memory of Floyd&#x27;s death remains with players for years and is remembered as a direct experience.
Floyd&#x27;s death &quot;convey[ed] a sense of wonder at the unexpected and touching quality of the gesture.&quot;
The scene has been described as a minor milestone toward computer games as an expressive narrative art.

Game designer Raph Koster feels that Floyd&#x27;s death is &quot;cheating&quot; because it occurs in a cut scene.

*&quot;The V.I.P. of Gaming Magazine&quot; #3 (April/May, 1986)

==Legacy==
In February 1992, a remake of was developed and published by Japanese software development company SystemSoft for the NEC PC-9801, over eight-and-a-half years after the original &quot;Planetfall&quot;. There are differences in this enhanced remake: the game recognizes verb commands typed in kana (Japanese syllable system) or Latin alphabet. For convenience, some of the most common verb commands (Look, Take, etc.) can be accessed by pressing a corresponding button, but the player still has to type the name of an object. This remake also helps the player to interact with the environment by displaying a list of objects after the player has typed a command. Also, unlike the original, the remake contains enhanced graphics; every location has a unique background picture, on which the text is super-imposed, like in the PC-9801 version of &quot;Zork I&quot; and &quot;Enchanter&quot;.

<doc id="852374" wikidata="Q505147" url="?curid=852374" title="Weil der Stadt">
<text>Weil der Stadt is a town of about 19,000 inhabitants in the Stuttgart Region of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is about west of Stuttgart city centre, in the valley of the River Würm, and is often called the &quot;Gate to the Black Forest&quot;.

==Name==
The name Weil derives from the Latin word &quot;villa&quot;, an estate or manor. The suffix &quot;die Stadt&quot; (the town) was added to distinguish Weil from various nearby villages of the same name, such as Weil im Dorf and Weil im Schönbuch. The modern name is unusual in that it contains the dative article &quot;der&quot; rather than the nominative article &quot;die&quot;. This quirk arose because place names typically come after prepositions that govern the dative case in German, such as &quot;in&quot; or &quot;aus&quot;. The Roman origins of the town are immortalized in its coat of arms, which features the motto SPQR.

==History==
The village of &quot;Wile&quot; was first mentioned in 1075, and described as the property of the famous abbey of Hirsau. Weil der Stadt became a Free Imperial City in the 13th century, but had existed for centuries before as an important trading place.

The city was completely destroyed during the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648 but was subsequently rebuilt, and is still dominated by buildings from this period. The city&#x27;s fortifications have survived largely intact, with city walls, gates, and several towers.

Weil der Stadt is best known as the birthplace of the astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), and it bears the unofficial title of &quot;Keplerstadt&quot;, or Kepler town. Another famous son is the Protestant reformer Johannes Brenz (1499–1570). Due to its surroundings and attractive cityscape, dominated by the church steeple of St. Peter and Paul, Weil der Stadt is a popular destination for excursions in the Stuttgart region.

==Events==
Weil der Stadt is a stronghold of traditional carnival, which is celebrated with a parade in the city centre. In contrast to the carnival in the Rhineland, the carnival in Weil der Stadt, called Fasnet, is based on Alemannic traditions, shared by various towns in southwestern Germany and Switzerland.

Weil der Stadt escaped destruction in World War II when a French artillery barrage was called off in honour of it being Kepler&#x27;s birthplace.

== Notable people ==
* Heinrich Steinhöwel (ca. 1410 - 1479), German doctor, humanist, translator and writer. 
* Paul Scriptoris (ca. 1460 – 1505), a German Franciscan mathematician and Scotist
* Johannes Brenz (1499–1570), Lutheran theologian and the Protestant Reformer.

<doc id="852381" wikidata="Q1473702" url="?curid=852381" title="Peneda-Gerês National Park">
<text>Peneda-Gerês National Park (, ), also known simply as Gerês, is a national park in Norte Region, Portugal. Created in May 1971, it is the oldest protected area and the only national park in Portugal. It covers an area of , occupying the Districts of Viana do Castelo, Braga, and Vila Real and bordering the Spanish Baixa Limia – Serra do Xurés natural park to the north, with which forms the UNESCO biosphere reserve of Gerês-Xurés.

Peneda-Gerês was given its name by its two main granite massifs, the Serra da Peneda and the Serra do Gerês which, with the Serra Amarela and the Serra do Soajo, constitute the park&#x27;s highest peaks. On the other hand, the precipitous valleys, crossed by high flowing streams, host lush temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of oak and pine, being one of the last strongholds of the typical Atlantic European flora of Portugal, contrasting with an evolving Mediterranean biome. The park is also home to around 220 vertebrate species, some only native to the Iberian Peninsula including the threatened Pyrenean desman, Iberian frog, or gold-striped salamander.

The area now occupied by the park has had a long history, reflected by its countless megalithic structures and Roman remains. Presently it is home to around 9,000 people scattered throughout small villages.

The aims of the park are to protect the soil, water, flora, fauna and landscape, while preserving its value to the existent human and natural resources.

==History==
 

Probably due to the inhospitality of the Gerês Mountains, the oldest signs of human presence date only from 6000 BC to 3000 BC; dolmens and other megalithic tombs remain interspersed within the region, including near Castro Laboreiro and Mourela. Human activities consisted of animal husbandry and incipient agriculture, and archaeological evidence points to the beginning of a decrease in forest cover.

The Roman Geira, a Roman road, which formerly connected the Roman &quot;civitates&quot; of Asturica Augusta and Braccara Augusta, crossed what is now the park. Long stretches of the road along the Homem River are still preserved, as are several Roman bridges and numerous millenarium markers. The Germanic tribe of the Buri accompanied the Suebi in their invasion of the Iberian Peninsula and establishment in Gallaecia (modern northern Portugal and Galicia). The Buri settled in the region between the Cávado and Homem rivers, in the area later known as Terras de Bouro (&quot;Land of the Buri&quot;). The move from the terraced cliffs and slopes to the lowland river valleys brought-on a patterned of new deforestation.

The reoccupation of mountain areas started in the 12th century, intensifying in the 16th century with the introduction of maize, beans, and potatoes from the Americas. Agricultural fields occupied former pastures, and these were displaced to more elevated areas resulting in a mosaic of fields, pastures, and forests.

The reforestation of uncultivated lands, imposed by the government in 1935, reduced the available pastures, and contributed to a rural exodus that continued after the 1950s. Yet it was still common practice for the residents of mountain communities to spend part of the year in two locations, primarily near Castro Laboreiro. From about Easter to about Christmas, residents would live in homes over 1,000 m above sea level, known as &quot;branda&quot; (from the Portuguese &quot;brando&quot;, meaning &#x27;mild&#x27; or &#x27;gentle&#x27;). In the remaining part of the year, these inhabitants would occupy homes in the river valley, known as &quot;inverneira&quot; (from the Portuguese &quot;inverno&quot;, meaning &#x27;winter&#x27;).

In 1970, the village of Vilarinho das Furnas was flooded with the construction of a dam on the Homem River. During years with low rainfall, the village ruins stands above the water, attracting a considerable number of tourists.

The creation of the national park (completed under decree no. 187/71, 8 May 1971) envisioned a planning area of mountainous spaces, in order to conserve the environment, while permitting human and natural resource activities, which would include educational, touristic and scientific projects. At heart is the conservation of soils, water, flora and fauna, in addition to the preservation of landscapes within the vast mountainous region in the northwest of Portugal.

In 1997, Peneda-Gerês was included in the Natura 2000 network, and in 1999, designated a Special Protection Area for Wild Birds. Moreover, it also encompasses an important area of natural forest, which forms part of the European Network of Biogenetic Reserves, and is recognized as a national park by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In 2007, it was accepted in the PAN Parks network that certifies the quality protected areas, according to rigorous criteria of nature conservation, cultural services and sustainability.

== Geography ==
The Peneda-Gerês National Park is located in the northwest of Portugal, extending through the municipalities of Melgaço, Arcos de Valdevez and Ponte da Barca (in the district of Viana do Castelo), Terras de Bouro (district of Braga), and Montalegre (district of Vila Real). The park includes an area of 702.90 km2, of which 52.75 km2 are public lands, 194.38 km2 are private property and the remaining 455.77 km2 are commons.
===Physical geography===


The park is a vast amphitheatre-shaped space sculpted during the Variscan orogeny by geological forces, wind and water, and extends from the Castro Laboreiro to the Mourela plateaus, encompassing the Serra da Peneda, Serra do Soajo, Serra Amarela and the Serra do Gerês. These form a barrier between the ocean plains to its west and the plateaus in the east. The highest peaks are Peneda (1340 m), Soajo (1430 m), Amarelo (1350 m), Gerês (1545 m) and Altar dos Cabrões (1,538 m) located on the border with Galicia, continuing into this territory as part of the Serra do Xurés.
The granitic rocks that dominate this shield were deposited during the process of continental collision that brought together the lower Iberian peninsula with Europe, between 380 million and 275 million years; the oldest of them, at Amarela, date from 310 million years ago. The most extensive of the granitic rocks that occur within the park are the Peneda-Gerês pluton which is an exposed relief that became exposed around 290-296 Ma by the Gerês-Lovios fault. Sedimentary layers laid down between 435 and 408 Ma (Silurian epoch) were deformed and metamorphosed into schists, greywackes and quartzites (such as in the area of Castro Laboreiro). Also, dykes and sills formed from quartz and aplite-pegmatites were mineralized resulting in tin, tungsten, molybdenum and gold (which would become the focus of mining in the human era, at the now-closed mines of Carris and Borrageiro). Generally, the lithological structures can be divided into three layers:
* Gerês granite structures - includes Gerês, Paufito, Carris, Borrageiro and Tieiras, and is composed of special mineralogical and geochemical intrusions that occurred through third phase of Hercynian faults, caused by a differentiating of basic magmas. The terrain in these regions include a vigorous relief, a rounded granite petrography, such as in the Serra da Peneda;
* older granite structures - includes a very heterogeneous group of Mezio, Soajo, Serra Amarela, Linhoso, Parada, Tourém, Pedrada e Ermida, Germil, Sezelhe and Frades, with a texture and composition that quite variable, from the crustal fusion of various materials with surface contamination;
* sedimentary formations - includes sediments deposited in Silurian waters and metamorphosed during the Devonian period, as well as carbon and more recent sediments, resulting during the Quaternary. The first group includes principally schists and quartz-feldspar, greywackes and quartzites with meta-crystals, such as andalusite, cordierite and sillimanite. These sedminentary deposits are prominently preserved in two linear patches: Vale das Antas and Louriça, near Castro Laboreiro, between two granite structures. The most recent geological formations are those created by fluvial, torrential and glacial deposits.

During the Pleistocene (approximately 1.8 to 0.001 Ma ago) climatic variations resulted in an extension of glacial fields to the mid-latitudes. While there are no remnants of glaciers now, their Ice Age products (U-shaped valleys, moraines, glacial deposits, polished and natural granite surfaces) are identified in the Serra da Peneda, Serra do Soajo and Serra do Gerês mountain ranges. The principal watersheds that cross the park are those of the Minho (occupying 2% of the park), Lima (47.8%) and Cávado (50.2%), with brooks and waterfalls common on many of the mountain slopes, in addition to several secondary tributaries (such as the Homem, Rabagão, Castro Laboreiro, and Arado rivers). The Lima cuts across the PNPG east to west, while the Cávado serves the southern limits of the districts of Vila Real and Braga. Fractures in the landscape have confined the rivers to deep, straight valleys and are visible in the younger granite outcrops visible in the uncovered higher altitudes. Owing to the number tributaries, the construction of hydroelectrical dams has been undertaken to generate electricity across six locations: Alto Rabagão, Paradela, Caniçada, Vilarinho da Furna, Touvedo and Lindoso.

Soils within the elevated terrains and inclined spaces are non-existent, while the valleys are rich and deep, deposited and transported by pluvial action. These strata are textured, permeable, easily worked, albeit with a weak consistency, and marked by the peculiarities of local agriculture. The incorporation of biomass and elevated precipitation, along with the low autumn-winter temperatures give an origin to the alterations in pH levels. The elevated levels of incompletely decomposed organic material, low in phosphorus and intermittently low/high in potassium, are subject of alluvial deposition.

===Climate===

The region of the Parque Nacional Peneda Gerês falls within a transitional zone between the Atlantic and Mediterranean environments, and is influenced by various climatic systems: Atlantic, Mediterranean and Continental. Its climate is greatly influenced by the topography; the mountains exert a barrier effect to the passage of hot and wet air masses coming from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in elevated precipitation throughout the year.

It falls in a part of Portugal (and Europe) that is affected by extreme rainfall, obtaining precipitation levels of per year on higher altitudes, and at lower altitudes, with more than 130 rainy days per year. Average daily high temperatures range from , with some variation; the high lands have an average high temperature of about , ranging from , one of the few places in Portugal with an oceanic climate, while areas in the valleys (such as the Homem, Lima and Cávado river valleys) have warmer climates, with daily max temperatures ranging from (with an average of ), transitioning into a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate.
Consequently, the area is prone to various micro-climates, affected by variations in altitude, topographic characteristics, human occupation, different exposures and thermal variation. Similarly, this difference has resulted in an interchange of vegetation characteristic of Mediterranean, Euro-Siberian and Alpine environments.


===Biome===
Rivas-Martinez defined the foothills of both the Serra do Gerês and the Serra da Cabreira (lands below the Tâmega, Ave and Cávado watersheds) as the frontier between the Euro-Siberian and Mediterranean regions, granting a significant floral and phytogeographic importance to the National Park.

====Flora====
Biomass coverage of the Serra do Gerês, Serra Amarela, Serra do Peneda and Serra do Soajo, as well as the Mourela and Castro Laboreiro plateaus, are dominated by four distinct biomes: oak forest, shrubbery, marshes and riparian vegetation.

The floristic diversity includes 823 vascular taxa that occur in 128 types of natural vegetation. The oak forests which are common throughout the park, are especially concentrated in the Ramiscal, Peneda, Gerês and Beredo river valleys. These forested areas are dominated by an alliance between the Pyrenean (&quot;Quercus pyrenaica&quot;) and European (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;) oaks, which themselves are differentiated among the lower altitudes and exposed flanks (the &quot;Rusceto-Quercetum roboris&quot;) and those of typical Atlantic environments (&quot;Myretillo-Quercetum roboris&quot;). The first association is commonly found with European oak (&quot;Quercus rober&quot;), cork oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;), butcher&#x27;s broom (&quot;Ruscus aculeatus&quot;), maple (&quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;) and Portuguese laurel (&quot;Prunus lusitanica&quot;), while the second association unites the European and Pyrenean oaks with bilberry (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;), strawberry tree (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;) and European holly (&quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;). In upper altitudes there are patches of European oak that enter into their own association (&quot;Holco-Quercetum pyrenacia&quot;), which is integrated into another group (&quot;Quericon robri-patraea&quot;). These oaks have been, over the course of human settlement, the object of intense use, resulting in a general degradation of the spaces into nothing more than shrubbery.

The bush and shrublands, which characterize the remainder of the spaces (74% of the park), are dominated by dwarf (&quot;Ulex minor&quot;) and European (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;) gorse and heather (&quot;Erica umbellata&quot; and &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), with a mixtures of common juniper (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot;), southern heather (&quot;Erica australis&quot;) in the upper altitudes, while lower altitude bush includes cross-leaved heather (&quot;Erica tetralix&quot;), dwarf gorse (&quot;Ulex minor&quot;), Dorset heath (&quot;Erica ciliaris&quot;), common sundew (&quot;Drosera rotundifolia&quot;), pale butterwort (&quot;Pinguicula lusitanica&quot;), marsh violet (&quot;Viola palustris&quot;) and purple moor grass (&quot;Molinia caerulea&quot;).

Riparian and marshlands along the river courses are also sites of rare species of chain ferns (&quot;Woodwardia radicans&quot;), willow (&quot;Salix repens&quot;), downy birch (&quot;Betula pubescens&quot;), deciduous shrubs (&quot;Spiraea hypericifolia&quot;), Portuguese enchanter&#x27;s nightshade (&quot;Circaea lusitanica&quot;) and angelica herbs (&quot;Angelica laevis&quot;).

There are 627 flora species identified by Serra and Carvalho (1989) as under pressure and considered endangered, which included two medicinal plants: tutsan (&quot;Hypericum androsaemum&quot;) and sundew (&quot;Drosera rotundifolia&quot;). Based on the protection list of botanical species, and UICN categories: 18 are considered in risk of extinction, 17 are vulnerable and one is rare. They also identified two species as extinct within the park boundaries: a geranium (&quot;Geranium lanuginosum&quot;) and fragrant orchid (&quot;Gymnadenia conopsea&quot;). There are three endemic species. Those factors that have been identified that threaten these habitats include: natural and manmade fires, use of forest for fuel wood and agricultural use of habitats.

====Fauna====

Many of the studies conducted on the species that inhabitant the park have been concentrated in the area of Matas de Albergaria/Palheiros, traditionally identified as the &quot;heart&quot; of the park. Work by the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Porto and University of Minho have concentrated on a few mammals (Pyrenean desman, European otter, roe deer, and wild boar), reptiles and fish. These studies looked into the numbers of species and factors influencing their habitats.

Approximately 235 vertebrate species were identified within the boundaries of the park, of which 200 are threatened or under protection. These include three species of bat under pressure (of the eight that exist): greater horseshoe bat (&quot;Rhinolophus ferrumequinum&quot;), lesser horseshoe bat (&quot;Rhinolophus hipposideros&quot;) and Mediterranean horseshoe bat (&quot;Rhinoloplus euryale&quot;). Other species of particular importance: the Iberian shrew (&quot;Sorex granarius&quot;), the European pine marten (&quot;Martes martes&quot;), the European wildcat (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;), the gold-striped salamander (&quot;Chioglossa lusitanica&quot;) and the snub-nosed viper (&quot;Vipera latastei&quot;). A few of the local species are protected by the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. The red squirrel (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;) whose habitat is restricted and marginal in continental Portugal, is another species that is common to the park. After four centuries absent from Portuguese territory, its population began to be recorded in 1985–1986, in Viana do Castelo. There were also registered sightings in Albergaria, Lamas de Mouro and Serra da Paneda, while comparable encounters in Spain were identified across the border. Roe deer, which are a symbol of the park are encountered in prolific quantity, along the margins of the park, where they find shelter and food.

Meanwhile, other mammals, such as the population of Iberian wolf (&quot;Canis lupus signatus&quot;) have collapsed with human encroachment, while the number of exemplars are limited. Along with the golden eagle, the wolf was seen as a threat to livestock, and was almost hunted to extinction, although protected by law since the end of the 20th century. Brown bears disappeared from the region in the 17th century, and the extinct Portuguese ibex (&quot;Capra pyrenaica lusitanica&quot;), locally known as &quot;Gerês goat&quot;, was last seen in the 1890s. More than a century later, its vacant ecological niche was reoccupied naturally by Spanish ibex coming from Galicia, and their population numbered about 100 animals by 2011.

Worthy of mention are the &quot;Garrano&quot; (or Minho horse), a breed of small equine species who were ancestors of the Galician pony and Andalusian horse, which mostly live in the wild, but are a gentle breed with no significant fear of humans. For a long time these horses permeated the farms of Vilarinho das Furnas (before it was inundated with the dam&#x27;s construction), but later began to freely move between the Portuguese-Spanish border after 1979.
There are 147 avian species that are associated with the Peneda-Gerês park, especially along the Mourela region in the southern part of its frontier. In this region, although it might vary throughout the year (given climate and season), approximately 36 species make their nests in the area. Of particular note in this park are the: hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;), European honey buzzard (&quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;), common snipe (&quot;Gallinago gallinago&quot;), red-backed shrike (&quot;Lanius collurio&quot;), yellowhammer (&quot;Emberiza citrinella&quot;), garden warbler (&quot;Sylvia borin&quot;) and whinchat (&quot;Saxicola rubetra&quot;). For the winchat, the area of Mourela is the unique nesting ground in Portugal, while the red-backed shrike and yellowhammer are limited to Castro Laboreiro plateau and northern corners of the park.

Also important to highlight is the gold-striped salamander (&quot;Chioglossa lusitanica&quot;) a species endemic to the northwest Iberian peninsula, typically associated with mountainous areas with elevated precipitation.

The waters of the park teem with various species, often called &quot;Rios truteiros&quot; (&quot;Trout Rivers&quot;) for the abundance of trout. Although stocks have diminished, the salmon populations still spawns in the rivers of the park.

Species well represented in the biotopes of Peneda-Gerês include: 
* Pyrenean desman (&quot;Galemys pyrenaicus&quot;), commonly restricted to northern portions of the Iberian Peninsula and French Pyrenees;
* European otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;), a carnivore well adapted to waters of the park, but in decline throughout Europe, it inhabits the watercourses and uses the banks for shelter;
* Iberian emerald lizard (&quot;Lacerta schreiberi&quot;), endemic to the western portions of the Iberian peninsula, it inhabits mountainous river valleys, where it is protected by vegetation;
* Iberian frog (&quot;Rana iberica&quot;), common to Portugal, northwestern Iberia, and mountainous lands

===Ecoregions, zoning and management plan===

The 1971 classification of Peneda-Gerês as a national park came from a group of rules/requirements established to allow: the prudent use of the park&#x27;s resources, preservation of existing flora and fauna species, allowing for the continued cohabitation, while providing an environment for scientific, educational and touristic investigation. These specified:

* Areas of Natural Environments (), these were defined in 1991 into three zones:
** Integrated reserves: to preserve habitats and natural elements that were unique, vulnerable, rare, threatened or representative;
** Partial reserves: to allow conservation and environmental interpretation;
** Complementary areas: a transition zones between natural and rural environments.
* Freshwater Environments (): to provide means of management and conservation that would allow the constant preservation of existing water-based environments. The park is located within mountainous granite geomorphology, characterized by narrow watercourses, irregular inclines and unmineralized, highly oxygenated, semi-acidic, cold waters, which are the base of the ecosystem. Its importance, therefore, resulted in three-level classification of freshwater environments characterized by the natural resources that existed, and those activities which were permitted in each environment.
* Sites of Ornithological Interest (): areas identified for avian species conservation were prepared by Neves et al.

In 2011 a new management plan was published for Peneda-Gerês NP defining 5 levels of protection: total protection area, partial protection areas (levels I and II) and complementary protection areas (levels I and II). This management plan was based on a combination of biodiversity conservation and wilderness protection approaches. The plan was based on an up-to-date synthesis of all information and literature available about the protected area.

===Human geography===

Although there has been variable growth throughout the Norte region, there has been a general population decrease in those administrative units that fell within the Peneda-Gerês National Park (1981–1991), in the municipalities of Melgaço (-16.8%), Arcos de Valdevez (-13.4%), Ponte da Barca(-6.1%), Terras de Bouro (-7.2%), and Montalegre (-20.3%). There was a population of 9,099 according to the 1991 census, a 16% decrease from the 10,849 registered in 1981. There are no positive-negative variations between civil parishes; of those civil parishes that fell within the PNPG authority, their populations dropped from 0.8% (Vilar da Veiga) to 38.6% (Sezelhe).

These residents are concentrated primarily in various agglomerations: small nuclei separated from each other; an extension of buildings located along roadways; some isolated groups; constructions along agricultural roads in pasturelands; and three or more homes isolated by pastures. Consequently, there are six homogeneous zones:
* Castro Laboreiro and Rio Laboreiro Valley - consisting of small agglomerations separated by short distances. It was still common practice for the residents of mountain communities to spend part of the year in two locations, primarily near Castro Laboreiro. From about Easter to about Christmas, residents would live in homes above 1,000 m above sea level, known as &quot;branda&quot; (from the Portuguese &quot;brando&quot;, meaning &quot;mild&quot; or &quot;gentle&quot;). In the remaining part of the year, these inhabitants would occupy homes in the river valley, known as &quot;inverneira&quot; (from the Portuguese &quot;Inverno&quot;, meaning &quot;winter&quot;);
* Serras da Peneda and Serras do Soajo - small pastoral agglomerations, with different summer and winter residences;
* Lima Valley and Serra Amarela - where the Lima Valley consists of two or more agglomerations connected by lines of residences between them, while in the Serra Amarela populations are concentrated in isolated pockets;
* Gerês Valley - development of tourism, around the Caniçada Dam and Thermal baths, resulted in uncontrolled re-construction, re-modelling and expansion of existing residences, although there already existed a tendency for expansion along the avenues and accessways along the valley;
* Cabril-Gerês - steep areas along the River Cávado and Salamonde Dam, where buildings are concentrated along the accessways, and Cabril River, with pasturelands located between agglomerations;
* Mourela/Barroso Plateau - extending south, southeast and southwest, the plateau is a series of agglomerations, connected by avenues of built-up occupation. The expansion of Várzea, owing to the construction of the Paradela Dam, resulted in the reduction of cultivatable lands, meadows and marshes.

Some of the villages in the high lands are located near the arable lands. Terraces, built to make better use of these scarce lands, and traditional houses, with granite walls and thatch roofs, shape the landscape with an indelible, harmonious, human mark in some of the most isolated villages such as Pitões das Júnias and Ermida.

== Research ==
Over the last 50 years, the Peneda-Gerês National Park has been one of the most important sites for ecological research in Portugal, but also for other natural and social sciences. A number of studies have been conducted from the Peneda Field Station in Castro Laboreiro run by Prof. Henrique M. Pereira. These studies have looked at patterns of species diversity at multiple scales and their response to the habitat composition of the landscape and multiple land-uses. They have also documented a new moth species for science in 2015, &quot;Isotrias penedana&quot;.

==Economy==
The primary economic sector dominates the activities of residents that live within the park&#x27;s territory. Although agricultural activity remains difficult, it still out-paces secondary and tertiary activities which, apart from the Terras de Bouro and Ponte da Barca, have been insignificant. The inaccessibility and diminished exterior investment potential, has concentrated those activities in the region primarily in the exploration of forestry, the support of hydro-electrical generation and tourism. But this too is limited; tourism is concentrated generally in the vicinity of Caldas do Gerês, hydro-electrical transmission has not affected the local economy, and along with forestry, has not seen an appreciable re-investment or re-capitalization of wealth (with income generated transferred outside the local market).

The primary sector, although the largest contributor, is subsistence at best: supported by an ageing (mostly female) population; individual parcels are small and over-subdivided; producers that support familial or local clients; a production that is primarily concentrated on personal consumption; poor commercial networks; and physical and social isolation, with limited educational supports. Between 60 and 70% of the production is supported by subsidies.

Industrial activities in the civil parishes within the park are poorly diversified and support familial businesses. Civil construction, although one of the larger economic supporters, has little effect on local incomes, since a majority of the employed come from outside the region. Although there are a few larger operations (bread-making, construction and saw-milling/carpentry) most are small owner-operators, that support local consumption or occasional sales. Frequently, artisanal producers have disappeared, and have not been replaced by mass-produced or comparable vendors.

Similarly, tertiary activities are limited small operators; commonly poorly diversified, dominated by commercial establishments and focused on local consumption, they are operated by families and do not generate much in employment. Cafés and restaurants, are a good example of entrepreneurship, with many dotting the settlement landscape of the park&#x27;s limits, primarily in the area of Gerês. Other service sector activities are concentrated within the urbanized municipal seats and larger villages, with many of the more dynamic nuclei the centre of postal services, banks, posts for the G.N.R. or health centres.

== Barroso Agro-sylvo-pastoral System ==

In 2018 the Barroso Agro-sylvo-pastoral System (BASP) where trees are cultivated alongside crops was amongst the first European sites designated as &#x27;Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System&#x27; (GIAHS) by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The BASP is integrated into the Peneda-Gerês National Park as it is farming in harmony with nature. Of the 57 GIAHS that existed in the world 2018, only six were designated in Europe. The autochthonous Barrosã cattle with long curved horns, which can grow well over 100 cm in length. The animals graze freely on traditional pastures and marshes in conditions that are ideal for their welfare. The cattle enjoy a purity of nature that is characteristic of these places, contributing greatly to the preservation and biodiversity of the landscape as well as to the rural economic sustainability. Barrosã cattle have been extensively studied because of their ancient genetic heritage.

== Tourism ==

The park tries to simultaneously encourage and control tourism, since the park&#x27;s nature would not resist a massive flow of tourists. Accordingly, there are six small camping sites and several hikingtrails are marked, making it relatively easy to find many of the most interesting spots, such as the castros at Castro Laboreiro and Calcedónia and the monastery at Pitões das Júnias. The trail at Mézio as a particular concern in describing some of the local features.

Locations near the few major roads are the most visited. Many of them are related to the religiousness of the people in northern Portugal namely the shrines at Senhora da Peneda and São Bento da Porta Aberta. Others, such as Soajo and Lindoso, display small, traditional granaries built of granite, the &quot;espigueiros&quot; (from the Portuguese &quot;espiga&quot;, meaning &quot;spike&quot;/ear)). Soajo is a typical Portuguese village, located on one of the slopes of Peneda Mountains. The 24 espigueiros were erected on a granite slab and are still used today for drying corn.

Some of the two most known and visited features are the many waterfalls, including the one near the old frontier station at Portela do Homem, and the Vilarinho das Furnas village, whenever the Vilarinho das Furnas Dam is low enough, and the cascades along the Arado river.

The domestic animals also deserve being noted. The autochthonous &quot;Barrosã&quot; and the smaller &quot;Cachena&quot; cattle, used in agriculture, is nowadays endangered because it is losing its utility; as is also the Castro Laboreiro dog, a hunting dog.

<text>Clifford Forsythe, the Ulster Unionist Party Member of Parliament for South Antrim, died on 27 April 2000; as result, a [[by-election]] was held in the constituency on 21 September 2000.

==Candidates==

The election arose after the Good Friday Agreement, with prisoner releases having started, but before the pro-agreement parties had reached an agreement on the shape of a devolved government. After a disputatious selection contest, the London-based public relations executive David Burnside was selected as the new Ulster Unionist Party candidate. Burnside claimed to have supported the Agreement at the time of its negotiation but to have since turned against the way in which it was being implemented. However this was at odds with his party&#x27;s policy. This was seized upon by the Democratic Unionist Party candidate, former Mid-Ulster MP Rev. William McCrea in campaigning. McCrea campaigned on a policy of refusal to co-operate with Sinn Féin in the absence of progress on arms decommissioning.

The Northern Ireland Unionist Party initially selected Norman Boyd, who was a local member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (elected as a member of the United Kingdom Unionist Party). However, during the campaign Boyd withdrew, urging voters not to divide the anti-agreement vote, and supported McCrea. Although the Progressive Unionist Party had secured 8.7% of the vote at the previous general election, they did not stand on this occasion.

The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland selected David Ford, who was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the area and who had previously fought the seat in the 1997 general election. With all the Unionist candidates opposed to the Good Friday Agreement to some degree, Ford hoped to gain the support of pro Agreement unionist voters. However, with the Unionist parties fighting fiercely, Ford faced the difficult task of convincing voters that a vote for the Alliance was not wasted, especially when many who supported the Agreement argued that the best realistic result for maintaining it would be for Burnside to win the seat.

The nationalist SDLP also ran their local assembly member, in this case Donovan McClelland. With the constituency overwhelmingly Protestant the SDLP had no chance of winning and much of the spotlight on them concerned their electoral battle with Sinn Féin as a prelude to forthcoming Assembly elections. Sinn Féin had no Assembly members but ran Martin Meehan, who had been their sole Assembly candidate the last time, in the hope of increasing his profile and building up their local organisation in preparation for a shot at the next election. The battle between McClelland and Meehan attracted much attention as it would indicate the movement of votes within the nationalist community between the two parties, though most agreed that it was always likely for the SDLP to come out on top in the highly middle-class constituency.

In addition the Natural Law Party selected David Collins. This was to be one of the last occasions that the party would fight an election in Northern Ireland.

==Campaign==

With delays over the selection and the summer holiday intervening, polling day in the by-election was held off until 21 September, allowing extensive campaigning. The constituency is strongly Protestant and it was always clear that the real contest was between the two Unionist parties. Away from these two, interest was piqued by the advance of Sinn Féin, overtaking the Alliance in the number of votes won. Many believed that this heralded the former party subsequently taking the latter&#x27;s Assembly seat in the next assembly election, but in the event Ford narrowly held on.

<text>Warrington Wolves are a professional rugby league club based in Warrington, England. They play home games at the Halliwell Jones Stadium, and compete in Super League, the top tier of British rugby league.

Warrington Wolves are the only British based club to have played every season in the top flight. They have won the League Championship three times and the Challenge Cup nine times.

The club&#x27;s traditional home colours are white, primrose and blue and have local rivalries with Widnes, St Helens and Wigan.

==History==
===Early years: 1876–1895===
Although the official foundation date for the club is given as 1876, rugby football was certainly played in the town before that date and there was an earlier club bearing the name of Warrington Football Club. Under the heading &#x27;Outdoor Sports – Football&#x27; the Widnes Guardian of 25 January 1873 reports on a recent game between Warrington and Wigan at the unnamed ground of the former. On 6 December 1873 that same newspaper carried details of a match involving Warrington and Zingari (probably a Withington, Manchester club of that name) and in subsequent weeks there were matches with Sale and Free Wanderers. This club folded after its ground was lost to development work.

&quot;Warrington Zingari Football Club&quot; was formed in 1876 by seven young local men. Zingari is the Italian word for gypsies and was commonly adopted by clubs that lacked a permanent base. The team initially played on a field in the Howley Wharf area. Warrington Zingari&#x27;s first recorded game was an away game against Penketh on 28 October 1876, resulting in a defeat by a goal to nil. When the earlier Warrington club folded, Warrington Zingari decided to take the vacant Warrington Football Club name for the start of the 1877–8 season.

Over the next seven years, Warrington Zingari would have five new homes – off Sankey Street at two different sites, off Wilderspool Causeway at two different sites and Slutchers Lane. Amalgamations followed with Padgate Excelsior in 1881 and Warrington Wanderers in 1884 but the team retained the name Warrington.

Both the Lancashire and Cheshire Rugby Unions suspended all their competitions in the 1880s, clubs such as Warrington, St Helens, Widnes, Wigan and Runcorn that wanted to play in cup competitions formed a West Lancashire and Border Towns Union which ran a league competition until 1895 and competitions for a few years after 1895. In 1886, Warrington won their first silverware, the West Lancashire and Border Towns Trophy. 
Whilst Warrington were founder members of the West Lancashire League in 1889, they decided not to play in the competition in the 1890-1 and 1891–2 seasons, but became inaugural members of the Lancashire Club Championship First Class Competition in 1892–3.

On 28 August 1895, the committee decided to join with 21 other clubs throughout Lancashire and Yorkshire to form a new &#x27;Northern Union&#x27; and resigned from the RFU.

===Northern Union to the First World War: 1895–1918===
The new competition drew the top teams from Yorkshire and Lancashire led to a rise in the standard of opponents. Warrington defeated Hunslet 5–4 in their opening match but this was followed by four successive defeats. In a tough first season, Warrington finished 13th out of 22.

After only a single season of the cross-county competition, the Northern Union was boosted by a number of clubs defecting from the RFU. The Northern Union reverted to two county based leagues, and Warrington took part in the Lancashire Senior Competition, but could only manage a mid-table finish. The Wire fared better in the new Northern Union Challenge Cup and made it to the semi-final against eventual winners Batley before bowing out.

In 1898, Warrington moved to their Wilderspool Stadium home. A 10-year lease was agreed with Greenall Whitley for land on the east side of their existing ground, a pitch previously used by Latchford Rovers Rugby Club.

In 1900–01, Warrington reached the final of the Challenge Cup, facing Batley. A crowd of 29,000 turned out at Leeds to see Warrington battle hard but be beaten by two tries to nil. Warrington also appeared in the renamed South West Lancashire Cup against Leigh two days later. The strenuous game against Batley took its toll on the Warrington players and the match ended in a 0–0 draw, the replay never took place as Warrington were unable to raise a team and so forfeited the trophy.

Warrington&#x27;s first trophy in the new era followed the next season when the Wire picked up the South West Lancashire League when a play-off was required to beat Widnes after the teams finished level on points.

The 1901–2 season saw the reestablishment of a cross-county league, Warrington were one of the 14 teams that were to form the Northern Rugby Football League.

In 1903–04, Warrington defeated Bradford Northern in a semi-final replay to earn a place in the final of the Challenge Cup. Warrington put up a fine performance against Halifax but lost 8–3. After two Challenge Cup final defeats, Warrington finally succeeded in bringing home the cup in 1904–05, Warrington beat Hull Kingston Rovers 6–0 in front of a crowd of 19,638. A highest to date league finish of fifth was achieved in the same season.

Warrington&#x27;s second Challenge Cup victory came two years later in 1907, when Warrington beat Oldham 17–3. A Lancashire Cup final defeat to Broughton Rangers occurred in the same season.

In 1908, 14 November the first touring Australian rugby league team visited Warrington. The Kangaroos embarked upon a massive six months tour of Britain taking in 45 matches. Their timing was not good as the north of England was hit by strikes in the cotton mills, which badly affected attendances as fans could not afford to watch the pioneering Aussies. On Saturday 14 November 1908 Warrington played the Kangaroos. Warrington won the match 10–3, with Jackie Fish the hero scoring one try and Ike Taylor the other, Fish and George Dickenson kicked a goal each. A crowd of 5,000 watched the match at Wilderspool. The Warrington team that day was Jimmy Tilley, Jack Fish, George Dickenson, Ike Taylor, Lewis Treharne, Ernest Brooks, John Jenkins, William Dowell, Alfred Boardman, Billy O&#x27;Neill, George Thomas, Peter Boardman, and John Willie Chester. The Australians came back to Wilderspool for &quot;revenge&quot; later in the tour but tries from Jack Fish, and John Jenkins earned the &#x27;Wirepullers&#x27; an 8–8 draw. Two members of the Kangaroo squad, Dan Frawley and Larry O&#x27;Malley later signed for Warrington and played the next season at Wilderspool. Warrington have the best record of any club side against the touring Kangaroos with eight wins, one draw, and seven defeats from sixteen matches.

In 1913, Warrington reached their fifth Challenge Cup Final, with wins over Keighley, Hull Kingston Rovers, Salford and Dewsbury. The final was lost 9–5 to the mighty Huddersfield &quot;Team of all the Talents&quot;. Warrington scored first through a try by Bradshaw converted by Jolley and gave a wonderful display in what was considered to be the best Cup Final of the pre-war era. A disappointing league season had seen Warrington finish 18th, their lowest pre Great War. So the Challenge Cup performances were a tremendous achievement.

Warrington purchased Wilderspool in 1914 with the freehold being held in trust for club members. At first, the beginning of the First World War did not impact rugby league competitions, as authorities decided to continue with normal fixtures, in part due to the mistaken belief that the war would be short.

Competitive fixtures were suspended for the 1915–16 season and Warrington did not play any friendly matches due to difficulty raising a team. Wire recommenced playing in 1916 following the introduction of conscription which meant that they would not be accused of keeping men from volunteering for the First World War.

===The inter war years: 1918–1939===
After the war ended, Warrington took part in the hastily arranged Lancashire League played during 1918–9. In the Lancashire League, a runners-up spot was achieved in 1920–1.

After a bad start to the 1921–22 season, Warrington won 12 out of 13 matches. This included an 8–5 victory over the visiting Australasian team of the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. Warrington beat St. Helens Recs and Leigh to reach the final of the Lancashire Cup. Wire beat Oldham 7–5, despite playing with only 12 men for most of the match after centre Collins sustained a broken collar bone.

After finish in a record low position of 20th in 1923–4, the club improved to ninth the following season, before finishing second, and securing a first ever top four play-off, in 1925–6. Swinton were beaten in the semi-final, but the final against Wigan ended in disappointment.

After a bad start to the 1927–28 season and a poor previous season, culminating in an all-time low in 1928 when the club suffered its then record defeat 68–14 at Hunslet, Warrington notched up victories over Hull Kingston Rovers, Huddersfield and finally Leeds in the semi-final of the Challenge Cup. The final against Swinton was played at Central Park, Wigan, with an estimated 12,000 travelling from the town to watch the match. Warrington were beaten 5–3, but a contentious decision could have cost the Wire the match. The Kangaroos visited Wilderspool again in 1929, Wire were without five regular players either playing for Lancashire or injured. Despite this, Warrington beat the tourists 17–8.

In 1932–33, the Lancashire Cup was won by beating St Helens in a close fought match, the final result being 10–9 to Warrington. St. Helens Recs. and Wigan were disposed of on the way to that particular victory. As well as doing well in the league the team had reached the Challenge Cup final for the seventh time. This was the first time Warrington played at Wembley. The Wire lost 21–17 to Huddersfield. In the 1933–34 season, Warrington played Australia and for once were beaten. Warrington also had the honour of playing the first rugby league match against a French side, captained by Jean Galia. In a season of firsts a match was played in Dublin to introduce the game to Ireland. A good crowd saw Wigan beat Warrington by 32–19.

The highlight of the 1935–36 season was a place in the Challenge Cup final at Wembley. Barrow were beaten in the first round, the second round was drawn away at Halifax with Warrington winning the replay at Wilderspool 18–15. Wigan were then beaten 5–2 to set up a semi-final against Salford at Wigan. Warrington was short of regular players and were thought to stand little chance, but as ever in they rose to the occasion to gain victory. Fifteen special trains were laid on as the town made its way to London for the final, however Leeds ran out 18–2 winners.

Chris Brockbank became Wire&#x27;s first team manager in 1936. In the 1937–38 season, Oldham and Widnes were both knocked out by Warrington as they headed for another Lancashire Cup victory, this time 8–5 over Barrow.

During World War II, it was difficult to play matches and therefore pay the bills. To help out the club committee decided that a Limited Company of 10,000 £1 shares was to be created. The Warrington Football Club Limited was born. Warrington dropped out of the wartime Lancashire league in 1941–42 due to Wilderspool Stadium being requisitioned by the United States Air Force for storage, and did not return to league competition until 1945–46.

===Post Second World War, the Bevan era: 1945–1962===
The early post-war years saw a boom in rugby league in general, and the glory years of the Warrington club. An Australian winger named Brian Bevan made his debut for Warrington in 1945. He would be Warrington&#x27;s top try scorer in all but one season until his retirement in 1962 with a total of 740 tries in 620 games for Warrington. The Wire won all the code&#x27;s major honours during his period at the club.

Warrington got off to a bad start to the 1947–8 season but the club signed new forwards Harold Palin, Bill Darbyshire and Bill Riley. Warrington then went two months without defeat. The club also signed centres Albert Pimblett and Bryn Knowelden. With these new signings, Warrington went undefeated in 20 games from December 1947 to April 1948, won the Lancashire League and gained a place in the championship top four play-off. The club&#x27;s first championship win came that season. Warrington defeated Huddersfield in the league semi-final. The final, against Bradford Northern, was staged at Maine Road and Warrington took the trophy by a margin of 17–5.

Warrington won the 1948–9 Lancashire League after 19 straight wins at the start of the season. The record attendance at Wilderspool was set on 13 March 1948 when 34,304 spectators saw Warrington play Wigan. They reached the 1948–9 Lancashire Cup final but Wigan beat them to take the trophy. In the league Warrington lost only five matches all season. Huddersfield exacted one of Wire&#x27;s few defeats in the play-off final as Wire missed out on back-to-back championships by just one point, 13–12.

Wire paid a then record fee of £4,600 for Ally Naughton from Widnes. Naughton would play a major part in a good cup run took the Wire to the 1950 Challenge Cup final. This time they were to play local rivals Widnes. They led 14-nil at half-time, eventually taking the trophy by 19-nil. This was Wire&#x27;s first Challenge Cup triumph at Wembley.

The 1950–1 season saw Warrington finish the year as Lancashire League winners, Lancashire Cup runners-up and championship runners-up. Warrington lost the Lancashire Cup final to Wigan 28–5 at Swinton in front of a record 42,541 supporters. Warrington paid their third visit in four years to Maine Road to face Workington in the championship final. Despite leading 8–3 at half-time, Wire went down to a 26–11 defeat. In 1951 Ces Mountford was appointed coach with a ten-year contract after Chris Brockbank ended 15 years at the helm to take up a hotel business in Blackpool.

The pinnacle of Warrington&#x27;s achievements was reached in 1953–4. Consistent league form secured the Lancashire League, and saw a second-placed finish in the championship and qualified for the top four play-off. St. Helens came to Wilderspool and were well beaten 11–5. They despatched Leeds in the Challenge Cup to get to their second final of the season, they were to play Halifax in both games. The intense Wembley final ended in a draw, two goals a piece. The replay was held at Odsal, Bradford and a record 102,569 paid to see Warrington defeat Halifax 8–4. Thousands more got in for free and estimates of the total crowd were in the region of 120–130,000. The week after the two teams met again in the championship final at Maine Road. Warrington secured another victory by four goals to Halifax&#x27;s two goals and a try. The club had done the league and cup double as well as the Lancashire Cup.

Wire secured the league championship for the second successive season in 1954-5 They beat Halifax in the semi-final on the way to the final against Oldham at Maine Road. For the second consecutive season Warrington took the honours, the final score was 7–3. Warrington won the Lancashire League as well to make it ten pieces of silverware in eight years. That championship success was the last to date for Wire.

The 1955–56 season saw a tournament titled the ITV Floodlit Competition. Eight clubs participated in a series of games played at football grounds in the London area, with Warrington eventually running out 43–18 victors over Leigh at Loftus Road. Warrington made it to the 1956 championship final held at Maine Road but lost to Workington Town.

Wire&#x27;s run of success came to a sudden stop in 1956–7. It was a transformation period for Warrington with many big name players top names ending their Wire careers. Ces Mountford used a total of 40 players during the campaign, the highest since World War Two and a figure that was not beaten until 1976–7. Unsurprisingly, Wire finished only tenth in the league. Attendances were down on previous seasons and on 19 January 1957, Warrington launched a lottery, which played an important part in the club&#x27;s finances in future seasons.

In the 1959–60 season, they won the Lancashire Cup for the first time in 22 years, playing all their games away from home. St. Helens were the final hurdle but the Wire managed a 5–4 win at Central Park. This ended a period of four seasons without silverware.

In 1961, Warrington reached the championship final held at Odsal, but Leeds had total control over the match and ran out 25–10. This also turned out to be the last match for long serving coach Ces Mountford.

Ernie Ashcroft took over as coach for the 1961–62 season. Easter Monday 1962 saw Brian Bevan&#x27;s last match for Warrington, a 29–17 defeat of Leigh.

===1962–1971===
There was a split into two divisions in 1962–3 with Warrington gaining sixth spot in the top flight.

During the early part of the 1965–66 season floodlights were installed and a friendly match against Wigan was arranged. They were officially switched on for the match on Tuesday 28 September, Wigan winning the match. Warrington&#x27;s home game against Widnes became the first rugby league match to be broadcast on BBC albeit only to the south of England. The final of the Lancashire Cup was reached by gaining a 21–10 victory over Oldham in the semi-final. The final against Rochdale Hornets, at Knowsley Road, was won 16–5. It was Ashcroft&#x27;s only trophy in his time as Wire coach.

Success was proving difficult for Warrington. Attendances had dwindled, costs were rising and the club were having financial difficulties. Wire appointed a new coach Jackie Fleming in 1967 who won the Lancashire League (1967-8) then Joe Egan in 1969.

After a disastrous start to the 1970–71 season, coach Joe Egan decided to stand down. He was replaced by Peter Harvey. The change made little difference as the club won only 11 out of 24 matches. The club also had debts of around £33,000. The club was saved by a take-over bid from new chairman Ossie Davies and as part of the rescue package on 20 May 1971, Alex Murphy was appointed the new player-coach of the club.

===Alex Murphy era: 1971–1978===
After crashing out of the Lancashire Cup and the Floodlit Trophy in 1971–2, the team created a club record eight successive defeats. Warrington improved for the Challenge Cup; reaching the semi-finals, only missing out on a Wembley trip after losing a tense replay against St Helens. Murphy had brought renewed optimism to Wilderspool and average attendances went up by more than a thousand.

Success came in 1972–3. Warrington lost only one of their opening 22 games and ended the season with the League Leader&#x27;s Trophy.

Next season, 1973-4 was arguably Warrington&#x27;s most successful for 20 years. The Captain Morgan Trophy competition was run for the first and only time and Wire clinched it with a 4–0 defeat of Featherstone. Warrington followed that up with a 27–16 defeat of Rochdale Hornets in the John Player final and then Murphy&#x27;s men beat Featherstone for the second time that season in a cup final 24–9 win the Challenge Cup. The icing on the cake was the top eight play-off trophy, secured after a 13-12 success over St. Helens for a four-cup haul.

In 1974-5 Wire returned to Wembley for the Challenge Cup final only to have their celebrations spoiled by Widnes while they also had to settle for runners-up in the Floodlit Trophy.

In contrast to recent seasons, nothing went right for Warrington in 1975–76. They finished tenth in the league and crashed out of the Lancashire Cup and the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy competitions in the opening round. Challenge Cup hopes ended in the third round at home to Widnes but they were lucky not to have been knocked out in the first round by amateurs Leigh Miners at Wilderspool. Warrington struggled to a 16-12 success.

There was no silverware again in 1976-7 but Warrington finished fifth in the league. They crashed out of the Premiership play-offs at the first hurdle, but yet appeared in the final, after Hull Kingston Rovers fielded an ineligible player and the match was awarded to Warrington. Wire won through to the final but lost to St Helens at Swinton 32–20.

In 1977–8, Murphy&#x27;s reign came to an end despite winning the John Player Trophy 9–4 against Widnes at Knowsley Road, St Helens. Poor league form had left Wire dangerously close to the drop at one point and that meant Murphy lost many friends on the terraces.

===Late 1970s to mid-1990s===
In 1978, Warrington appointed Billy Benyon as Alex Murphy&#x27;s successor. A solid year-round performance saw Warrington finish second in the league, losing only 8 matches all year. A major highlight of the season was the controversial 15–12 victory over the Ashes-winning 1978 Kangaroo tourists. For the second year running the club reached the John Player Trophy final, but were unable to repeat the previous year&#x27;s victory, the match going to Widnes by 16–4.

Wire celebrated their centenary in 1979 owing to an erroneous belief that the club had been founded in 1879 rather than 1876.

The 1980–1 season brought the Lancashire Cup and the John Player Trophy. After consistently good performances in the league, they were league championship runners-up. They also won the 1985 Premiership Trophy final against Halifax. Warrington also made it to the 1986–87 John Player Special Trophy held at Burnden Park but were beaten 4-18 by Wigan.

Warrington had another new coach in 1982, their former Challenge Cup medal winner Kevin Ashcroft. Benyon was later to win an unfair dismissal case against Warrington. Ashcroft steered Warrington to Lancashire Cup glory in his first full season, a year marred by the Wilderspool fire which wiped out the complete main stand.

Warrington and Ashcroft parted company in May 1984, despite Ashcroft still having two years on his contract. Reg Bowden, Wire&#x27;s third new coach in six years, took over. Bowden&#x27;s two-year spell as coach was notable for some of his signings, most notably a world record fee for Great Britain and Widnes scrum half Andy Gregory, rather than success on the field. The new signings didn&#x27;t bring success, and Bowden resigned and assistant coach Tony Barrow took over as caretaker coach in March 1986.

Success soon followed. A home win against Widnes and away to Wigan put Wire in the final of the Premiership Trophy against champions Halifax at Elland Road. Wire ran out 38–10 winners. In 1986–7, Wire finished third place in the league and runners-up in the John Player Trophy and in the revamped Premiership Trophy.

Australian Brian Johnson was appointed the club&#x27;s head coach and manager in 1988. Warrington won the Lancashire Cup final a year later in 1989. In 1990 Warrington made it to the final of the Challenge Cup at Wembley Stadium and faced arch rivals Wigan. Warrington lost 34–16 and this is the last appearance in the Challenge Cup final before their success in 2009.

Warrington won the Regal Trophy in 1991 beating Bradford Northern 12–2 at Headingley, Leeds. In June 1993 due to financial pressures, Warrington listed 13 players for a total of £340k when they refused lower contract payments. Warrington made it to the final of the Regal Trophy in 1994 but lost 40–10 to Wigan at McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield, they also came close to winning the championship finishing third on points difference behind Wigan and Bradford. The following season, Warrington made the Regal Trophy final once more, again losing to Wigan.

With the advent of Super League, several mergers between clubs were proposed. Warrington were scheduled to merge with Widnes to form &quot;Cheshire&quot; who would compete in Super League. This brought an outcry from both sets of fans, and Warrington were awarded a place in the Super League as an unmerged side.

The need to switch to summer, led to a truncated 1995–6 season which ran from August–January, with October reserved for the World Cup. Despite Warrington&#x27;s mediocre league form, they found themselves in the semi-final of the Regal Trophy at St Helens. This ended in an 80–0 defeat which brought about the departure of coach Brian Johnson, and a run of seven defeats.

===Super league era: 1996–2002===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. Warrington added &quot;Wolves&quot; to their name for the start of the 1997 season; wolf symbols had started to appear on Warrington shirts in the early nineties, and a wolf featured in the middle of the town&#x27;s coat of arms. To mark this change Warrington produced a new logo.

John Dorahy took over as coach and the new era started optimistically. Their first Super League game was a 22–18 win at Leeds and Wolves finished fifth place in the inaugural Super League. This was as good as it got for Wolves a long time, Warrington became a ‘selling club’, first losing Iestyn Harris to Leeds, then Paul Sculthorpe to Saint Helens. Dorahy resigned in March 1997, before the end of the season with Warrington sitting on the bottom of the Super League ladder. 
In 1997, Darryl van der Velde took over as head coach. Plans to move from Wilderspool Stadium were announced with Burtonwood the likely site. The former brewery on Winwick Road was chosen to be the new home for Warrington and Tesco were also to develop on the land with their first ever supermarket in the town. A lengthy planning process finally ended with permission finally given for a 14,206 capacity stadium and supermarket to be built. The capacity was reduced to 13,500 on safety grounds after the first match.

Wilderspool stadium was sold to the local council for £1 million in 1998 but despite this Wolves finish the season in financial trouble with massive debts.

In 2000, retired Australian captain and scrum-half, Allan Langer came out of retirement to play in Super League for Warrington Wolves. He captained the side and took them to within one match of the Challenge Cup final in 2000.

Steve Anderson succeeded van der Velde in August 2001, he was replaced by his assistant David Plange mid-season following a run of 11 defeats which threatened Warrington&#x27;s record of continuous top level rugby. Paul Cullen was appointed head coach in 2002, becoming the third coach of the season. Cullen not only achieved survival but also led Wolves to a first ever play-off appearance since the reintroduction of this format in 1998.

===Move to Halliwell Jones Stadium: 2004–2009===
Warrington&#x27;s first season in the Halliwell Jones Stadium saw slight underachievement on the pitch reflected in their finishing position of eighth in Super League, though they did make the Challenge Cup semi-finals. However, they recorded a significant increase in their average attendances and midway through the season the club was purchased by events promoter Simon Moran. Moran immediately released fresh investment into the club, enabling coach Paul Cullen to sign Great Britain centre Martin Gleeson for a club record fee reported in the region of £200,000 as well as New Zealand internationals Henry Fa&#x27;afili and Logan Swann.

Their best season in Super League has been the 2005 season (Super League X), where they finished in 4th place and earned a home tie in the playoffs. Australian Andrew Johns played 3 games for the club when his Australian club Newcastle concluded their season. He is rumoured to have been paid around £40,000 (A$100,000) per match for the Wire. The signing caused controversy for a number of reasons: if the Wire had made the Super League Grand Final, it would have clashed with the Kangaroos Tri-Nations test against New Zealand in Sydney, Australia; also, many people questioned why Warrington were allowed to bring in a player in time for the Super League play-offs after he had finished playing a full season in Australia. The signing and subsequent confusion over the rules led other Super League clubs to follow the example set by the Wire and signed their own Antipodean players on short-term contracts.

On 22 September 2006, Warrington beat Leeds 18–17 at Headingley to progress to the second round of the Super League play-offs. This was the first time during the Super League era that the Wire had progressed past the first round of the play-offs. However, they were unable to progress any further as they were beaten 40–24 by Bradford Bulls at Odsal Stadium.

For the 2007 season, Warrington signed current Great Britain international Adrian Morley on a four-year deal from the Sydney Roosters NRL club, Paul Johnson, another Great Britain international, from Bradford Northern on a three-year deal and New Zealand international back rower or centre Vinnie Anderson, 27, on a three-year deal from St Helens, paying a £50k transfer fee. Warrington finished the 2007 season seventh in the table, which was seen as a disaster for the club following the impressive signings made during the close season. Finishing 7th resulted in Warrington missing out on the end of season playoffs for the first time in three years with local rivals Wigan pipping the Wire on the last weekend of the season.

On 27 May 2008, Paul Cullen resigned from the coaching role at the club following a run of only one victory in seven league fixtures. James Lowes was appointed as the new head coach of the club and given a contract until the end of the 2010 season. The club went on to finish the season in sixth position in the table and securing a play-off tie away to Catalans Dragons. The Wolves lost 46–8 ending what was another season to forget for the club.

===Tony Smith era: 2009–2017===

On 5 March, after losing all three of their opening games to the Super League XIV season, Warrington removed James Lowes from the position of head coach, and replaced him with then-England coach, Tony Smith who was also given the role of director of rugby.

On 30 May 2009, Warrington reached the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup, beating Hull Kingston Rovers 24–25 via a drop goal from Lee Briers in golden point extra time to earn a place in the last four. The semi-final draw pitted the Wire against Wigan. On 8 August 2009, Warrington beat Wigan to reach Wembley for the first time in 19 years and despite only averaging crowds of 8,000 in recent seasons (2009 average attendance 8,155) they sold just over 34,500 tickets for the Challenge Cup final. Wolves faced the Huddersfield Giants in the final at Wembley Stadium in front of a 76,560 crowd. Warrington scored first after a charge down with Richie Mathers going over the line under the sticks. Warrington eventually won the game 25–16 with Michael Monaghan winning the Lance Todd Trophy for the man-of-the-match performance. Warrington returned home from Wembley with the cup and was greeted by more than 100,000 fans who had been starved of success for 35 years. This was their first Challenge Cup win since 1974, and the team arrived home on an open top bus, and paraded the trophy round the town before heading to the town hall. Warrington finished the 2009 season in lowly 10th place missing out on the play-offs yet again. After the final game of the season Chairman Lord Doug Hoyle announced that he would be stepping down from the post and leaving the Wolves.

On 8 August 2010, the Wolves emphatically beat Catalans Dragons 54–12 at the Halton Stadium, Widnes to reach the Challenge Cup Final for the second consecutive season. Warrington went on to win the final, defeating Leeds Rhinos 30–6. Once again over 35,000 Wolves supporters travelled down to Wembley Stadium to see the Wolves lift the trophy for the second successive time, this being the first time in the club&#x27;s history this has been done. On the return to Warrington the following day over 100,000 people lined the streets of the town to welcome home the team and the trophy.

The 2010 Super League season saw the Wolves finish in 3rd place the club&#x27;s highest ever finish in the Super League era. Warrington qualified for the end of season play-offs only to lose both fixtures to St. Helens and Huddersfield Giants. This meant that the Wolves had only won one of the club&#x27;s six play-off fixtures to date.

The 2011 Super League season saw Wolves end their St. Helens hoodoo with victory in the away fixture which was played at the Halton Stadium, Widnes. The Wolves secured their double over the St. Helens with a 35–28 triumph over the rivals in the reverse fixture later in the season. 2011 saw the Wolves register impressive victories away to Leeds Rhinos (6–42), Bradford Bulls (14–58) and Salford City Reds (0–60). They also registered big scorelines at home to Harlequins RL (84–6), Bradford Bulls (64–6), Wakefield Trinity Wildcats (66–12) and Castleford Tigers (62–0). On 20 August 2011, the Wolves beat Catalans Dragons 12–25 in Perpignan to register the club&#x27;s 8th successive league victory for the first time in the Super League era. On 9 September 2011, the Wolves beat Hull F.C. to secure the League Leaders Shield for the first time. Warrington were beaten in the play-off semi-final by Leeds Rhinos who eventually went on to win the Grand Final beating St Helens at Old Trafford on 8 October.

Going into the 2012 Super League season the Warrington club announced that they had over 8,000 season tickets, which is a record for Warrington and a vast improvement on the crowds of just 3/4,000 in the Wilderspool days.

In 2012, the Wolves enjoyed another successful season in both the league and cup competitions. In the 2012 Challenge Cup the Wolves were crowned cup winners for the 3rd time in 4 years following a 35–18 victory over Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium. Over 35,000 Wolves supporters made the trip to see the side bring back the famous trophy. The Wolves also made it through to the Super League Grand Final and were backed by 40,000 fans at the theatre of dreams. The Wolves faced the Rhinos for the right to become champions but it was Leeds who held on to become back-to-back champions.

In 2013, Warrington finished Super League XVIII in second place with 41 points, only 1 point behind League Leaders Shield winners Huddersfield Giants. Warrington won their qualifying play-off against Leeds with the final score 40–20, Ben Westwood scored 4 tries. The result put Warrington through to the qualifying semi-final against Huddersfield, who were defeated 30–22. In the Grand Final Warrington Wolves faced Wigan Warriors and lost by 30–16.

In 2016, the club&#x27;s 140th year, the club reached the Challenge Cup final losing 10–12 to Hull F.C. but the Wolves went on to win the League Leader Shield against Hull F.C. at the KCOM Stadium, bringing the first piece of silverware back to the Halliwell Jones Stadium since 2012, and bagging a home Semi-final tie against St. Helens. This was won, earning them the right to play in the Super League Grand Final against Wigan Warriors. Warrington fell to a 6–12 defeat, with Declan Patton scoring all the Wires&#x27; points, despite leading 6–2 at half-time.

The Wolves failed to make the Super 8s in 2017, finishing ninth in the regular season as they suffered from inconsistency. Warrington secured Super League status with seven wins out of seven. In the Challenge Cup, the Wolves fell at the quarter-final stage following a nervy 26–27 home defeat by the Wigan Warriors. In September 2017, the Wolves announced that head coach Tony Smith would leave his position at the club following nine successful years which has seen the Wolves compete in seven major finals, winning three Challenge Cups and two League Leaders Shields.

===Steve Price: 2018–2021===
In the Super League XXIII season, Warrington reached the 2018 Super League Grand Final against Wigan but lost the match 12–4 at Old Trafford.
During the Super League XXIV season, Warrington reached the Challenge Cup final against St Helens and won the match 18–4 at Wembley Stadium. It was Warrington&#x27;s first Challenge Cup triumph in seven years.
Warrington finished the Super League XXIV season in 4th place on the table and qualified for the finals. Warrington&#x27;s season was ended the following week when they lost 14–12 against Castleford in the elimination final.

In the 2020 Super League season, Warrington finished third on the table. However, they were eliminated from the first week of the playoffs losing to Hull F.C.

In the 2021 Super League season, Warrington finished in third place on the table. However, just like the 2020 season, the club were eliminated from week one of the playoffs losing to Hull Kingston Rovers 19–0. It was also the final game in charge for Steve Price, who left the club at the end of the season, being replaced by former Castleford boss Daryl Powell for the 2022 season.

===Daryl Powell: 2022-2023===
In the 2022 Super League season, Warrington endured a difficult campaign finishing 11th on the table with the club winning just nine games all year in the league.

At the start of the 2023 Super League season, Warrington recorded eight consecutive victories to sit top of the Super League table. However, from round 9 to round 20, the club only recorded four victories. After losing 42–6 to bottom placed Wakefield Trinity in round 20, Powell departed the club by mutual consent. Warrington had lost their final six games under Powell which saw them fall to sixth on the table.
Warrington would eventually finish sixth on the table to qualify for the playoffs. Warrington would lose their elimination play off final against St Helens 16-8 which ended their season.

===Sam Burgess: 2024===
On 7 August 2023, Burgess signed a two-year contract to become Warrington&#x27;s new head coach ahead of the 2024 Super League season.
Under Burgess, Warrington started the season in good fashion and at the halfway point of the season were sitting fourth on the table. On 8 June 2024, Burgess coached Warrington in their 2024 Challenge Cup final defeat against Wigan.
Warrington would finish the 2024 Super League season in third place on the table. After defeating St Helens 23-22 in the elimination playoff, the club would fall one game short of the grand final losing to Hull Kingston Rovers 10-8. This extended Warrington&#x27;s championship drought to 70 years.

==Stadiums==
===1881–2003: Wilderspool===

Warrington moved into the Wilderspool in 1881 and spent over 130 years there. In the late 1990s the club planned to move to a new stadium instead of redeveloping Wilderspool.

===2004–present: Halliwell Jones Stadium===
In 2004 Warrington moved into a new stadium 13,012 capacity stadium. The stadium was notable for bucking the common trend of modern stadia by including terracing areas rather than being an all-seater stadium. There were originally 4 stands in the stadium – the North Stand (reserved seating), the East Stand (originally unreserved seating but later became reserved seating), the South Stand (home terracing), and the West Stand (visitors&#x27; terracing and overflow of home terracing). It also has enormous pitch dimensions of 120 m x 74 m, as requested by Warrington&#x27;s head coach of the time, Paul Cullen, due to his desire to play expansive rugby. In 2012 the stadium capacity was expanded to 15,200 by filling in two corners of the stands. In 2017 the stadium added two permanent big screens, one outside the north east corner for advertising, and one inside the south east corner to enhance gameday experience.

==Rivalries==


The Warrington Wolves have several rivalries, the fiercest of which is with the Widnes Vikings. Widnes were out of the top flight for a large period of the Super League era so the rivalry is not as fierce as it used to be. Games involving the Wigan Warriors have gained a rivalry due to the recent success of the Wolves and the Warriors and with both teams continuing to be among the Top-4 clubs in the Super League era.

Since the start of the Super League the fixtures against St Helens have become a fierce battle due to the St Helens holding a hoodoo over Warrington. From 1992 to 2010, Warrington only managed to beat Saints once (in 2001). However, in 2011 and 2012, the Wire managed to win three of six derbies, including a win in the 2012 playoff semi-final. Saints continued their dominance with a 22–10 victory the next year. In 2015, Warrington lost their first away match at Langtree Park to St Helens, as well as the Magic weekend fixture at St. James&#x27; Park, Newcastle 20–16, giving Warrington their first Magic loss to the Saints.

Other rivalries include the Salford Red Devils and the Leigh Centurions for geographical reasons.

<text>Timken OK Load is a standardised measurement that indicates the possible performance of extreme pressure (EP) additives in a lubricating grease or oil. The units of measurement are pounds-force or kilograms-force. This measurement is performed using a special test machine and standard block and ring test specimens.

The test machine is based on a machine manufactured by the Timken Company from 1935 to 1972, It is now an industry recognized standard test to compare extreme pressure resistance of greases and oils in a reproducible way. 

It is not to be confused with some smaller lubricity testers that are also often erroneously called Timken: the confusion originates from a now obsolete Italian brand TIMPKEN.

The test machine consists of a standardized bearing race mounted on a tapered arbour rotating at high speed. The race is brought into contact with a square steel test block under a constant load. The contact area is flooded with the lubricant or grease being tested. The Timken OK Load is the highest standard load at which the spinning bearing race produces no scouring mark on the test block, but only a uniform wear scar.

Timken OK Loads are listed on grease and oil property charts and are part of many specifications. It was once generally assumed that the measure and the film strength of the lubricant were directly related. Today, the primary purpose of the test is to determine whether EP additives are present and functioning. A measure of 35 pounds (16 kilograms-force or 155 newtons) or more means that EP additives are present and working well.

The Timken OK Load test methods are ASTM D-2509 for greases and ASTM D-2782 for oils.

There are a few portable versions of smaller testers utilizing similar test methods for public demonstration or for product showcase.

<text>The 2000 Preston by-election was a parliamentary by-election held in England on 23 November 2000, to elect a new Member of Parliament (MP) for the House of Commons constituency of Preston in Lancashire.

The vacancy was caused by the death on 2 September 2000 of Audrey Wise, the constituency&#x27;s Labour Party MP. The Labour vote share declined, but with the main beneficiaries being fringe parties, the Labour candidate Mark Hendrick held the seat comfortably. The by-election was held on the same day as the 2000 West Bromwich West by-election and the 2000 Glasgow Anniesland by-election, both also won by the Labour Party.

Peter Garrett used the description &quot;Preston Christian Alliance&quot;. David Braid used the description &quot;Battle for Britain&quot;.

23 November 2000 was the last time three or more by-elections occurred on a single day until November 2012, when three by elections occurred on 15 November and three more on 29 November.

<doc id="852421" wikidata="Q3308581" url="?curid=852421" title="Pensacola Christian College">
<text>Pensacola Christian College (PCC) is a private Christian college in Pensacola, Florida. Founded in 1974 by Arlin and Beka Horton, it has been accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools since 2013.

==History==

Arlin and Beka Horton graduated from Bob Jones University in 1951, and moved to Pensacola, Florida, in 1952 to found a Christian grade school. That school, Pensacola Christian Grade School, opened in 1954; it was later renamed Pensacola Christian Academy.

In 1974, the Hortons opened Pensacola Christian College to further their vision of &quot;Education from a Christian Perspective.&quot; The college had 100 students its first year open, and was based in a single building, Ballard Hall.

Pensacola Theological Seminary, an extension of PCC&#x27;s graduate school, was founded in 1998. Its avowed purpose is &quot;to fill each student&#x27;s mind and heart with what the Bible says.&quot;

In February 2012, Arlin Horton announced that he would be retiring from the ministry after May 2012. The school&#x27;s board voted unanimously to install Troy Shoemaker, a PCC graduate, as president of the college. Shoemaker, a former administrator at Pensacola Christian Academy, completed his undergraduate education at PCC and holds a Doctor of Education degree from the institution as well as an education specialist degree from the University of West Florida. In July 2019, Shoemaker hired Jon Lands as the executive vice president. Lands completed his undergraduate education at PCC, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in pastoral ministries. He also received his honorary doctorate from PCC in 2011.

A concert at the school on February 11, 2023, by the British a capella ensemble the King&#x27;s Singers was cancelled with two hours&#x27; notice due to &quot;concerns&quot; about the &quot;lifestyle&quot; and sexual orientation of a member of the group. Pensacola Christian College&#x27;s Articles of Faith classify homosexuality as a form of sexual immorality along with adultery, fornication, bestiality, incest, and use of pornography, citing passages in the Book of Matthew, the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and the Book of Hebrews.

==Academics==

PCC has nine academic divisions including Bible, business, education, engineering and computer science, humanities, natural sciences, nursing, performing arts, and visual arts. Graduate degrees are offered through the graduate school at PCC and through Pensacola Theological Seminary in the fields of Bible, business administration, communicative arts, divinity, education, ministry, music, and nursing.

The college markets its education programs as being specifically intended to prepare educators for employment at Christian schools rather than public schools, though graduates of the programs have been eligible to apply for public school teacher certification in Florida since 2000.

Because the college accepts a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative from the Bible and rejects evolution and other mainstream theories about the origins and age of Earth, students are taught young Earth creationism, and that God created the Earth in six literal 24-hour days. PCC&#x27;s biology classes are based on creationism.

===Accreditation===

Since 2013, Pensacola Christian College has been accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), a religious national accreditation agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, to offer associates to doctorate degrees. However, Pensacola Christian College does not participate in any federal or state funded financial aid programs. In consequence, the college is exempt from federal guidelines concerning many forms of discrimination (e.g., Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972), investigations into accusations of sexual abuse, and sharing of information about crimes on campus (Clery Act).

From 1974 until 2011, Pensacola Christian College did not seek accreditation. In numerous publications the school explained that it eschewed accreditation, indicating that an outside agency that did not share its religious and moral views might try to pressure the college to change or eliminate its beliefs.

The college changed course on November 9, 2011, when the administration informed its students that PCC had been awarded candidacy for accreditation, a pre-accreditation status, by Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools. In October 2013, PCC was officially accredited by TRACS.

The baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degrees in nursing at Pensacola Christian College are also accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing, and the baccalaureate degree in engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.

==Student life==

===Athletics===

PCC participates in the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) for intercollegiate sports. Sports include men&#x27;s basketball and soccer and women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball. The men&#x27;s wrestling team won the NCCAA national championship in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1998, the last year before the NCCAA discontinued the sport. The Men&#x27;s Eagles Basketball games as well as the Lady Eagles basketball games are played in the arena level of the Sports Center. PCC also hosts a number of invitational high school sporting tournaments and camps.

In addition to intercollegiate athletics, PCC students are also afforded the opportunity to play intramural sports through their Collegians. Sports offered through collegians include soccer, basketball, softball, volleyball, and broom-hockey among others, and the Eagles have a cheerleading squad called the Blue Crew. Every fall Collegian Soccer culminates with the winners of the playoffs facing each other in the annual Turkey Bowl held over the Thanksgiving weekend. In the spring, students can play softball and basketball.

===Recreation===

The campus offers opportunities for individual or group recreation, such as the Arlin R. Horton Sports Center which originally opened in 1993. The sports center has facilities for ice skating, bowling, racquetball, miniature golf, table tennis, and weight lifting. In addition with an expansion completed in 2008 by Hewes &amp; Company, LLC, it includes a surfing wave, water cannons, an inline skating track, a rooftop sun deck, a snack bar, and climbing walls. The campus also has the John Ray Hall Field House in which students can play basketball, swim, work out in the weight room, and play tennis. For students willing to make the 30-minute drive, the West Campus has 24 Hobie catamarans with classes &quot;offered in sailing, kayaking, swimming, and lifeguarding.&quot;

===Rules and regulations===

PCC policies govern many aspects of the students&#x27; lives, including dress, hairstyles, cleanliness of residence hall rooms, styles of music, borrowing, off-campus employment, and Internet access. For example, &quot;All students are expected to dress modestly, in conservative fashions and . . . men are not to wear effeminate hairstyles or apparel.&quot;

PCC also prohibits physical contact and interaction between unwed members of the opposite sex. Mixed groups must obtain a &quot;3+ Pass&quot; to hang out off campus, however, men and women are not allowed to ride in the same vehicle to the destination without an approved chaperone. Students over the age of 23 are not required to have a chaperone on a date, but cannot go to a beach or a park after dark.

Most stairwells, elevators, and parking lots on campus are segregated by gender. This includes all residence halls where the students live. 

Other prohibited activities at PCC include &quot;fornication, adultery, homosexual behavior, or any other sexual perversion. Also, any involvement in pornography or sexual communications, including verbal, written, or electronic.&quot; In addition, &quot;most forms of dancing,&quot; profanity, hazing, discrimination, gambling, stealing and &quot;witchcraft, séances, astrology, or any other satanic practices&quot; are also banned. Students are also not allowed to use, possess, or &quot;associate&quot; with alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. Policy violations also include visiting movie theaters, patronizing unauthorized area businesses, being off campus after hours, and being in a residence hall belonging to a member of the opposite sex.

====Demerits and discipline====

PCC has three levels of punishment; students can be given &quot;infractions,&quot; &quot;demerits,&quot; or be expelled. The school operates a &quot;demerit&quot; system where &quot;demerits&quot; are &quot;recorded on a student&#x27;s record for the purpose of limiting continued misconduct, given for continued neglect of responsibilities or for more serious offenses.&quot; Students may be given notices, charges, demerits, or be expelled. Students who have these demerits are subject to administrative review by the Student Court, during which demerits are assigned or canceled corresponding to the degree of the infraction or circumstantial conditions surrounding the incident in question.&quot;

In the past (at least until 2008), students who acquired a certain number of demerits in a semester were &quot;campused,&quot; meaning they were not allowed to leave campus for a period of time. Students suspected of more serious violations could be subject to being &quot;shadowed,&quot; where they were assigned to a Residence Assistant (a fellow student who was selected by PCC to provide leadership in the residence hall and to enforce college regulations). This included being required to attend the Residence Assistant&#x27;s classes and moving to the Residence Assistant&#x27;s room. While being shadowed the student was prohibited from speaking with any student other than with the Floor Leader who was shadowing them.

The rules and disciplinary policies at Pensacola Christian College have been the subject of criticism. In 1996 a PCC alumnus started an electronic newsletter entitled &quot;The Student Voice&quot;, which criticized PCC, particularly the school&#x27;s rules and demerit system. It was originally published in a newsletter format distributed exclusively via e-mail, and it was later published at www.pensacolachristiancollege.com. Following numerous attempts by the college to have the website shut down through arbitration and lawsuits, the website&#x27;s owners relinquished control of the domain to the college, who has redirected the domain to the main PCC website.

Students may also be written up for infractions such as but not limited to: frayed pants, going off campus with a person of the opposite sex, watching movies rated PG-13 or higher, and listening to &quot;worldly music&quot;.

===Faith and King-James-only debate===
PCC rejects hyper-Calvinism, Modernism, Neo-orthodoxy, and the modern day charismatic movement and specifically states that &quot;Pensacola Christian is not a part of the &#x27;tongues movement&#x27; and does not allow students to participate in or promote any charismatic activities, nor do we permit students to promote hyper-Calvinism.&quot;

PCC also states the belief that the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; is the superior Greek text of the Bible and upon this basis uses the King James Version of the Bible for all pulpit ministry and classroom Bible instruction.

==Affiliated ministries of PCC==

===Campus Church===

The Campus Church, an Independent Baptist church, meets in the 6200 seat, 314,000 Sq. Ft. Crowne Center on Pensacola Christian College&#x27;s campus and has Sunday morning, evening and Wednesday evening services. The Campus Church is not a department of the college, but is a separate entity operating alongside the college.

===&quot;Rejoice in the Lord&quot;===

The Campus Church holds weekly services from the Crowne Center at Pensacola Christian College. The services are recorded and edited for the weekly television broadcast of &quot;Rejoice in the Lord&quot;. The programming of &quot;Rejoice in the Lord&quot; consists of musical numbers performed by the Rejoice Choir, various PCC musical ensemble groups, congregational singing recorded in the Campus Church and preaching by Pastor Jeff Redlin. The hour-long television program is broadcast at 8 p.m. Eastern on Sundays on the Daystar Television Network.

===WPCS===

Pensacola Christian College owns radio station WPCS 89.5 FM, known on-air as Rejoice Radio. WPCS is the main station of the Rejoice Broadcasting Network (sometimes referred to as &quot;RBN&quot;). The content heard on Rejoice Radio consists primarily of inspirational music and syndicated Christian radio programming.

===Abeka ===
Abeka, formerly known as A Beka Book, is a publisher affiliated with Pensacola Christian College that produces K–12 curriculum materials that are used by Protestant fundamentalist and other conservative Evangelical Christian schools, as well as non-fundamentalist Christian schools and homeschooling families around the world. It is named after Rebekah Horton, wife of college president Arlin Horton, both of whom founded both PCC and Abeka, administering them simultaneously. Abeka and BJU Press (formerly Bob Jones University Press) have been considered the two major publishers of Christian-based educational materials in America.

Abeka has been criticized for selling works that do not follow a scientific consensus regarding the origins of the universe, origins of life, and evolution. In &quot;Association of Christian Schools International et al. v. Roman Stearns et al.&quot;, a judge upheld the University of California&#x27;s rejection of Abeka publications for preparatory use because the books are &quot;inconsistent with the viewpoints and knowledge generally accepted in the scientific community.&quot;

In 1996, state and federal agencies requested millions of dollars of unpaid taxes between 1988 and 1995 from A Beka Book, at the time a division of PCC. In a settlement without any admission of wrongdoing, Pensacola Christian College paid $44.5 million in federal taxes. The organization also voluntarily paid $3.5 million Florida state taxes in full even though it had received legislative relief from them and no longer bore any legal liability for them, to avoid any appearance of offense or subsidization by the state. Amy Yohe is the administrator of Abeka.
=== Chris-Tex ===
Chris-Tex is a public foundation based in Pensacola, Florida that was founded in 1998 made to function as the investment and endowment manager for Pensacola Christian College. For the fiscal year 2022, revenue was $61 million with assets reported of $1.36b.

<doc id="852431" wikidata="Q5158825" url="?curid=852431" title="Concord Monitor">
<text>The Concord Monitor is the daily newspaper for Concord, the state capital of New Hampshire. It also covers surrounding towns in Merrimack County, most of Belknap County, as well as portions of Grafton, Rockingham and Hillsborough counties. The &quot;Monitor&quot; has several times been named as one of the best small papers in America and in April 2008, became a Pulitzer Prize winning paper, when photographer Preston Gannaway was honored for feature photography.

After publishing seven days a week for decades, starting in March 2024, it ceased print publication on Sundays.

==History==
The &quot;Monitor&quot; has been published continuously since 1864, under a variety of names, including the &quot;Evening Monitor&quot;, and owners. In the late 19th century it was owned by a publishing company called the Republican Press Association which also published a paper named the &quot;Independent Statesman&quot;. Its masthead calls it the &quot;Concord Monitor and New Hampshire Patriot&quot;, although the &quot;Monitor&quot; name is the only one in widespread use. James M. Langley, who had acquired both publications in the 1920s, was responsible for the merger.

William Dwight, publisher of the &quot;Holyoke Transcript-Telegram&quot; in Massachusetts, bought the &quot;Monitor&quot; from Langley in 1961, becoming its publisher. When he retired in 1975, his son-in-law George W. Wilson took over both the &quot;Monitor&quot; and Newspapers of New England Inc., the holding company of Dwight&#x27;s newspapers in Concord, Holyoke and Greenfield, Massachusetts.

The &quot;Monitor&quot; has been flagship of this chain — now encompassing four dailies and three weeklies in New Hampshire and Massachusetts — since 1993, when the &quot;Transcript-Telegram&quot; folded.

Its 2004 circulation was 22,000 daily, 23,000 Sundays. More recent figures put the daily circulation around 20,000.

In 2005, George W. Wilson retired as president of Newspapers of New England. Tom Brown became president of NNE, and Geordie Wilson, George W. Wilson&#x27;s son, became publisher of the &quot;Monitor&quot;. Brown retired in 2009 and was replaced by Aaron Julien, George W. Wilson&#x27;s son-in-law. John Winn Miller, former publisher of &quot;The Olympian&quot; of Olympia, Wash., was named the &quot;Monitor&quot;&#x27;s publisher in 2010.

In early 2013, Mark Travis, who had spent more than two decades at the paper as a reporter and editor, succeeded Miller as publisher. In June 2013, Travis also became editor. Travis left his dual roles at the paper in February 2014, with David Sangiorgio stepping in as acting publisher. Heather McKernan replaced Sangiorgio as publisher in May 2017; she also continued to hold the title of publisher at the &quot;Monadnock Ledger-Transcript&quot; in Peterborough, another NNE-owned newspaper.

==Awards and honors==
Photographer Preston Gannaway won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography in April 2008, shortly after departing from the &quot;Monitor&quot;. Gannaway was honored for her work on a project called &quot;Remember Me&quot; chronicling a local woman&#x27;s death.

It was the first time a newspaper in New Hampshire was awarded the prize. The &quot;Monitor&quot; stood out as the smallest paper to win an award that year, with its circulation just a fraction of the next smallest, the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot;.

While 2008 was the first year the &quot;Monitor&quot; or one of its staff won a Pulitzer, the paper has a number of alums who have been honored, including Jo Becker of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Steven Pearlstein of &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; both of whom also won the award in 2008.

In 1999, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; said that the &quot;Monitor&quot; was the best small paper in America and &quot;Time&quot; magazine has named it one of &quot;America&#x27;s best newspapers&quot;.

<text>The 2000 West Bromwich West by-election was a by-election held on 23 November 2000 for the British House of Commons constituency of West Bromwich West.

The constituency&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP) was the Rt. Hon. Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker. She resigned from the House of Commons as an MP and as Speaker on 23 October 2000, triggering a writ to move the by-election.

In 1997 the major parties had observed a recent tradition by not opposing the Speaker seeking re-election. On its return to partisan politics the seat reverted to Labour, in a similar result to that seen in 1992.

<text>William Alexander Macdonald (1860 – October 1, 1946) was a Manitoba lawyer and politician and British Columbia judge. He briefly served as leader of the Manitoba Conservatives during the 1890s.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Macdonald was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, the son of Frederick William Macdonald, and was educated there and at Osgoode Hall. Macdonald was called to the bars of both Ontario and Manitoba in 1882. He practised in Brandon, Manitoba from 1882 to 1897.

=== Political career ===
Macdonald first ran for public office in the provincial election of 1888, losing in the riding of North Brandon to Liberal Clifford Sifton, who went on to become an important provincial and federal cabinet minister. Macdonald was elected for Brandon City in 1892, defeating incumbent Liberal James Smart by 12 votes.

Before the 1892 election, Rodmond Roblin had been the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the opposition Conservative caucus. With Roblin having lost his seat, Macdonald was chosen as his replacement and was recognized as the official leader of the opposition. He did not serve in this capacity long; Macdonald&#x27;s election was declared void in mid-1893, and he lost a by-election to Liberal Charles Adams on September 8 of the same year.

In 1896, Macdonald ran federally as the official Conservative candidate in Brandon. He was defeated by D&#x27;Alton McCarthy, a maverick Conservative who opposed the extension of French-language rights and was supported by local Liberals. 

=== Later years ===
From 1897 to 1909, Macdonald practised law in Nelson, British Columbia. In 1909, he moved to Vancouver, where he was counsel for the board of trade. In 1913, Macdonald was named judge in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. He died in Vancouver at the age of 86.

<doc id="852442" wikidata="Q621977" url="?curid=852442" title="ASTM International">
<text>ASTM International, formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials, is a standards organization that develops and publishes voluntary consensus technical international standards for a wide range of materials, products, systems and services. Some 12,575 apply globally. The headquarters is in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, about northwest of Philadelphia. It was founded in 1902 as the American Section of the International Association for Testing Materials.

== History ==
In 1898, a group of scientists and engineers, led by chemist, industry leader, and proponent of standardization Charles Dudley, formed the American Society for Testing Material (ASTM) to address the frequent rail breaks affecting the fast-growing railroad industry. The group developed a standard for the steel used to fabricate rails.

In 1961 the name &quot;American Society for Testing and Materials&quot; was adopted.

In 2001, ASTM officially changed its name to &quot;ASTM International&quot; and added the tagline &quot;Standards Worldwide&quot;.

In 2014, the tagline changed to &quot;Helping our World Work better.&quot; ASTM International had offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Peru, Washington, D.C., and West Conshohocken, PA.

In April 2016, the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI) became a subsidiary of ASTM International. SEI is an accredited third-party certification organization that certifies various types of PPE to industry consensus standards.

On June 9, 2022, it was announced that the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and ASTM International agreed to extend and expand a Technical Cooperation Agreement from 2019.

== Membership and organization ==
Membership in the organization is open to anyone interested in its activities. Standards are developed within committees, and new committees are formed as needed, upon request of interested members. Membership in most committees is voluntary and is initiated by the member&#x27;s request, not by appointment or invitation.

Members are classified as users, producers, consumers, and &quot;general interest&quot;. The latter includes academics and consultants. Users include industry users, who may be producers in the context of other technical commodities, and end-users such as consumers. To meet the requirements of antitrust laws, producers must constitute less than 50% of every committee or subcommittee, and votes are limited to one per producer company. Because of these restrictions, there can be a substantial waiting-list of producers seeking organizational memberships on the more popular committees. Members can participate without a formal vote and their input will be fully considered.

As of 2015, ASTM has more than 30,000 members, including over 1,150 organizational members, from more than 140 countries. The members serve on one or more of 140+ ASTM Technical Committees. ASTM International has several awards for contributions to standards authorship, including the ASTM International Award of Merit (the organization&#x27;s highest award) ASTM International is classified by the United States Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

== Standards compliance ==
ASTM International has no role in requiring or enforcing compliance with its standards. The standards may become mandatory when referenced by an external contract, corporation, regulation, law, or government.

In the United States, ASTM standards have been adopted by incorporation or reference in many federal, state, and municipal government regulations. The 1995 National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act requires the Federal government to use privately developed consensus standards whenever possible. The Act reflects what had long been recommended as best practice within the Federal government. Other governments, including state and foreign, have also referenced ASTM standards.

Corporations doing international business may choose to reference an ASTM standard. All toys sold in the United States must meet the safety requirements of ASTM F963, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety, as part of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008. The law makes the ASTM F963 standard a mandatory requirement for toys while the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) studies the standard&#x27;s effectiveness and issues final consumer guidelines for toy safety.

<doc id="852451" wikidata="Q152013" url="?curid=852451" title="General Motors EV1">
<text>The General Motors EV1 is a battery electric car produced by the American automaker General Motors from 1996 until its demise in 1999.

A subcompact car, the EV1 marked the introduction of mass produced and purpose-built battery electric vehicles. The conception of the EV1 dates back to 1990 when GM introduced the battery electric &quot;Impact&quot; prototype, upon which the design of the production EV1 was largely inspired. The California Air Resources Board enacted a mandate in 1990, stating that the seven leading automakers marketing vehicles in the United States must produce and sell zero-emissions vehicles to maintain access to the California market. 

Mass production commenced in 1996. In its initial stages of production, most of them were leased to consumers in California, Arizona, and Georgia. Within a year of the EV1&#x27;s release, leasing programs were also launched in various other American states. In 1998 GM unveiled a series of adaptations for the EV1, encompassing a series hybrid, a parallel hybrid, a compressed natural gas variant, as well as a four-door model, all of which served as prototypes for possible potential future models. Despite favorable customer reception, GM believed that electric cars occupied an unprofitable niche of the automobile market. The company ultimately crushed most of the cars, and in 2001 GM terminated the EV1 program, disregarding protests from customers.

Since its demise, the EV1&#x27;s cancellation has remained a subject of dispute and controversy. Electric car enthusiasts, environmental interest groups, and former EV1 lessees have accused the company of self-sabotaging its electric car program to avoid potential losses in spare parts sales, while also blaming the oil industry for conspiring to keep electric cars off the road.

== History == 
In contrast to numerous electric vehicles of its time, the EV1 was a purpose-built electric vehicle, not a conversion of another car. This factor contributed to its significant development cost of US$350 million, as well as its high production costs. Kenneth Baker, a General Motors engineer, served as the lead engineer for the EV1 program, having previously served as such for the unsuccessful Chevrolet Electrovette program in the 1970s.

=== Origins ===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the automobile industry saw little progress in electric car development; over 80 percent of vehicles produced in the United States featured V8 engines. But shifts in federal and state regulations began to influence this. The enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment and the 1992 Energy Policy Act, alongside the introduction of new transportation emissions regulations by the California Air Resources Board, contributed to a revived interest in electric vehicles in the United States.

In January 1990 GM chairman Roger Smith demonstrated the Impact, a battery electric concept car, at the 1990 Los Angeles Auto Show. GM aimed for a production rate of 100,000 cars per year, as opposed to the initially proposed 20,000. Developed by the electric vehicle company AeroVironment, the Impact drew upon design insights acquired from GM&#x27;s participation in the 1987 World Solar Challenge. This challenge was a trans-Australia race for solar vehicles, in which the company&#x27;s Sunraycer was victorious. Alan Cocconi of AC Propulsion designed and built the original drive system electronics for the Impact, and the design was later refined by Hughes Electronics. The car was powered by 32 lead–acid rechargeable batteries. On April 18, 1990 Smith announced that the Impact would become a production vehicle with a goal of 25,000 vehicles. The Impact achieved a top speed of .

Impressed by the feasibility of the Impact and spurred by GM&#x27;s commitment to produce a minimum of 5,000 units, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) initiated a significant environmental effort in 1990. They mandated that each of the seven largest automakers in the U.S., with GM being the largest among them, must ensure that two percent of their fleet would be emission-free by 1998, increasing to five percent by 2001 and ten percent by 2003, based on consumer demand. The board clarified that the mandate aimed to address California&#x27;s severe air pollution issue, which, at that time, exceeded the combined pollution levels of the other 49 states. Other participants of the former American Automobile Manufacturers Association, including Toyota, Nissan, and Honda, also individually developed prototype zero-emissions vehicles in response to the new mandate.

In 1994, GM initiated &quot;PrEView&quot;, a program in which fifty handcrafted Impact electric cars would be loaned to drivers for durations of one to two weeks, with the stipulation that their feedback and experiences would be documented. Volunteers were required to possess a garage suitable for the installation of a high-current charging unit by an electric company. Driver response to the cars was favorable, as were reviews by the automotive press. According to &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, the Impact &quot;is precisely one of those occasions where GM proves beyond any doubt that it knows how to build fantastic automobiles. This is the world&#x27;s only electric vehicle that drives like a real car.&quot; &quot;Automobile&quot; called the car&#x27;s ride and handling &quot;amazing&quot;, praising its &quot;smooth delivery of power&quot;. That year, a modified Impact set a land speed record for production electric vehicles of . Despite the good reception, as highlighted in a front-page feature in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, GM appeared to be less than enthusiastic about the prospect of having created a thriving electric car:

According to the report, GM viewed the PrEView program as a failure, leading them to believe that the electric car was not yet viable, and that the CARB regulations should be removed. Dennis Minano, GM&#x27;s vice president for Energy and Environment, questioned whether consumers desired electric vehicles. Robert James Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, also doubted the readiness of mass produced for electric cars, stating in 1994 that &quot;if the law is there, we&#x27;ll meet it ... at this point of time, nobody can forecast that we can make an electric car&quot;. These automakers&#x27; skepticism was criticized by Thomas C. Jorling, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation for New York State, which had adopted the California emission program. According to Jorling, consumers had shown significant interest in electric cars. Jorling suggested that automakers were hesitant to transition from internal combustion engine technology due to their massive investments.

=== First generation ===
Following the PrEView initiative, work on the GM electric car program persisted. While the original fifty Impact cars were destroyed after testing was finished, the design had evolved into the GM EV1 by 1996. The first generation, often referred to as the &quot;Gen I&quot;, would be powered by lead–acid batteries and had a stated range of 70 to 100 miles. A production run of 660 vehicles ensued, with paint options including dark green, red, and silver. The vehicles were offered through a leasing arrangement, explicitly prohibiting the option to buy under a contractual provision (with a suggested retail price listed at $34,000). Saturn assumed responsibility for leasing and maintenance of the EV1. Analysts projected a potential market ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 cars annually.

Similar to the PrEView program, lessees were pre-screened by GM, with only residents of Southern California and Arizona initially eligible for participation. Leasing rates for the EV1 ranged from $399 to $549 a month. The car&#x27;s debut was marked by a significant media event, featuring a US$8 million promotional campaign incorporating prime-time TV commercials, billboards, a dedicated website, and an appearance at the premiere of the Sylvester Stallone film Daylight. Among the initial lessees were notable figures such as celebrities, executives, and politicians. At the release event, 40 EV1 leases were signed, with GM anticipating leasing 100 cars by year&#x27;s end. Deliveries began on December 5, 1996. In the first year on the market, GM leased just 288 cars. But in 1999 Ken Stewart, the brand manager for the EV1 program, characterized the feedback from the car&#x27;s drivers as &quot;wonderfully-maniacal loyalty&quot;.

Joe Kennedy, Saturn&#x27;s vice president of marketing at GM, acknowledged concerns regarding the EV1&#x27;s price, the outdated lead–acid battery technology, and the car&#x27;s restricted range, stating, &quot;Let us not forget that technology starts small and grows slowly before technology improves and costs go down&quot;. Some groups opposing taxation expressed disapproval of the exemptions and tax credits given to EV1 lessees, arguing it amounted to government-subsidized driving for affluent individuals. Certain groups, such as the fake consumer organization &quot;Californians Against Utility Company Abuse&quot;, which opposed the use of taxpayer funds for public EV charging stations, were accused of being funded by oil companies with interests in maintaining the dominance of gasoline cars.

Marvin Rush, a cinematographer for the TV series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, noticed that GM was not adequately promoting the EV1. Concerned, he personally invested $20,000 to create and broadcast four unofficial radio commercials for the car. Although GM initially opposed this initiative, their stance shifted later on. They decided to endorse the commercials and reimburse Rush for his expenses. In 1997 the company allocated US$10 million for EV1 advertising and pledged to raise this amount by an additional US$5 million the next year.

=== Second generation ===
In 1998 for the 1999 model year GM released a second iteration of the EV1. Noteworthy improvements included lower production costs, quieter operation, extensive weight reduction, and the advent of a nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH). The Gen II models were released with a 60 amp-hour, 312-volt () Panasonic lead–acid battery pack. Subsequent models featured an Ovonics NiMH battery, rated at 77 Ah with 343 volts (). Cars with the lead–acid pack had a range of , while the NiMH cars could travel between charges. The second generation EV1 leasing program expanded to several other American cities, with monthly payments ranging from $349 to $574. A total of 457 second generation GM EV1s were produced by the company and leased to customers.

On March 2, 2000 GM issued a recall for 450 first generation EV1s. The automaker had determined that a faulty charge port cable could eventually build up enough heat to catch on fire. Sixteen &quot;thermal incidents&quot; were reported, including at least one fire that resulted in the destruction of a charging vehicle. The recall did not affect second generation EV1s.

=== Costs ===
GM established lease payments for the EV1 based on an initial vehicle price of . Lease payments varied from approximately $299 to $574 per month. An industry official suggested that each EV1 cost the company around , including research, development and other associated costs; other estimates placed the vehicle&#x27;s actual cost as high as $100,000. GM invested slightly less than $500 million into the EV1 and electric vehicle-related technologies, and over $1 billion in total.

== Design ==
=== Construction and technology ===
To enhance its efficiency, extensive wind-tunnel testing was conducted on the EV1, and GM additionally implemented partial fender skirts on the rear wheelhouses. The rear wheels are closer together than the front wheels, thereby creating the &quot;teardrop&quot; shape. These factors resulted in a very low and a . Its design incorporated super-light magnesium alloy wheels and self-sealing, low-rolling resistance tires developed by Michelin rounded out the EV1&#x27;s good efficiency characteristics. These tires, mounted on the lightest fourteen-inch wheels ever used, are inflated to 50 pounds per square inch (psi), compared to the standard 35 psi for normal tires. The special rubber compound utilized in these tires, along with their hardness, contributed to its low rolling resistance. 

Its recyclable aluminum structure was the world&#x27;s lightest, weighing . Thus it constituted 10 percent of its overall weight, in comparison to the usual 20 percent. The EV1 features regenerative braking, a system in which applying the brakes turns the drive motor into a generator. This process not only slows down the vehicle but also captures its kinetic energy, returning it to the battery for reuse. To save weight and maximize performance, GM designed the EV1 as a subcompact two-seater vehicle. Efforts to minimize weight extended to most of the components of the car, including the incorporation of magnesium in the frames of the seats. In addition, the power-assisted anti-lock brakes are electrically activated. The front disc brakes operate on an electro-hydraulic system. The rear drums represent an industry first, being fully electric, which eliminates the requirement for hydraulic lines or parking brake cables. 

Traditionally vehicles use heat produced by the engine to heat the passenger compartment. But since electric vehicles generate minimal waste heat, an alternative solution had to be conceived. GM opted for a heat pump to regulate the temperature inside the EV1, consuming a third of the energy required by a traditional unit for both cooling and heating. Nevertheless the system effectively warmed passengers only when temperatures exceed . To address colder climates, upcoming electric vehicles were anticipated to incorporate heat pumps alongside compact fuel-fired heaters.

=== Drivetrain and battery ===
The electric motor in the EV1 operated on a 3-phase AC induction system, generating at 7,000 revolutions per minute (RPMs). The EV1 could maintain its full torque capacity across its entire power range, delivering of torque from 0 to 7,000 RPMs. Power was transmitted to the front wheels through an integrated single-speed reduction transmission.

The first generation EV1 models featured lead–acid batteries weighing . These batteries, initially supplied by GM&#x27;s Delco Remy Division, were rated at 53 amp-hours at 312 volts (16.5 kWh), offering an initial range of per charge. In 1999 the second generation EV1 cars adopted a new set of lead–acid batteries from the Japanese electronics company Panasonic, increasing the weight to . The batteries were rated at 60 amp-hours at 312 volts (18.7 kWh), extending the EV1&#x27;s range to . Shortly after the introduction of the second generation cars, the planned nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) &quot;Ovonics&quot; battery pack, developed under the Delco Remy organization, commenced production. This pack made the car&#x27;s curb weight . The NiMH batteries were rated at 77 amp-hours at 343 volts (26.4 kWh), providing a range of 160 miles (257 km) per charge, doubling the range of the original first generation cars. Charging the NiMH-equipped cars to full capacity could take six to eight hours.

The EV1 used the Magne Charge inductive charging paddle, manufactured by Delco Electronics, a subsidiary of GM. This paddle was inserted into a slot located between the EV1&#x27;s headlights. The wireless charging technology ensured that no direct connection was required, although there were rare instances of fires starting at the charge port. For fast recharging of the vehicle, a home charger provided by GM was necessary. In addition to the fast charger, GM offered a 120-volt AC convenience charger for the lead–acid battery that could be utilized with any standard North American power socket for slower charging of the battery pack.

== Conversions ==
GM revealed a family of alternative fuel prototype models at the 1998 Detroit Auto Show. Among these, the compressed natural gas variant was the only model in this family that was not electric, and it was a conversion of the standard two-seat EV1 platform. It featured a 1.0-liter turbocharged engine, and its advertised fuel efficiency was rated at . The series hybrid prototype featured a auxiliary power unit (APU) housing a gas turbine engine situated in the trunk. Supplied by Williams International, an American manufacturing company founded by Sam B. Williams, the unit comprised a lightweight gas turbine and a high-speed permanent magnet AC generator, the former of which primarily charged the vehicle&#x27;s batteries. The Williams APU had the capability to operate on either compressed natural gas or gasoline. According to GM&#x27;s assertions, the vehicle could attain when running on the latter, offering a total range of . Conversely when operating solely in electric mode, it was estimated to achieve a range of . The parallel hybrid variant featured a 1.3-liter Isuzu turbocharged, direct injection diesel engine, delivering . GM also introduced a fuel cell variant; its system comprised a fuel processor, an expander/compressor, and a fuel cell stack. Another noteworthy development was the unveiling of a four-passenger variant of the EV1, extended in length by .

== Demise ==
Despite favorable customer reception, GM believed that electric cars occupied an unprofitable niche of the automobile market. The company ended production of the EV1 in 1999, after 1,117 examples were produced over its tenure of under three years. On February 7, 2002 Ken Stewart, the brand manager of GM Advanced Technology Vehicles, informed lessees that GM would be recalling the cars from the road, which contradicted a previous statement indicating that GM had no plans to withdraw cars from customers. The EV1 program was terminated in late 2003 under the leadership of then-GM CEO Rick Wagoner.

58 EV1 drivers submitted letters along with deposit checks to GM, seeking lease extensions with no financial burden on the automaker. These drivers indicated their willingness to cover maintenance and repair expenses for the EV1, while granting GM the authority to terminate the lease in case of costly repairs. Despite this proposal, in June 2002 GM declined the offer and returned the checks, totalling over US$22,000. In November 2003 GM initiated the retrieval of the vehicles; approximately forty units were donated to museums and educational establishments, albeit with deactivated power systems intended to prevent future operation. However, most of the vehicles were dispatched to car crushing facilities for demolition.

In 2003 Peter Horton, an actor reporting for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, sought to lease an EV1 from GM but was informed that he &quot;was welcome to join their waiting list [of a few thousand] along with [an undisclosed number of] others for an indefinite period of time, but his chances of getting a car were slim&quot;. In March 2005 GM spokesman Dave Barthmuss discussed the EV1 with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, noting that &quot;There [was] an extremely passionate, enthusiastic and loyal following for this particular vehicle [...] There simply [were not] enough of them at any given time to make a viable business proposition for GM to pursue long term&quot;.

By the end of August 2004 GM had reclaimed all leased EV1s from their lessees, resulting in the absence of any EV1s on the road. However, one EV1 was showcased at the Main Street in Motion exhibit at Epcot in Walt Disney World, located in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

Five EV1s were reported to be donated to China in 1998, specifically to the National Electric Vehicle Experimental &amp; Demonstration Area (NEVEDA), a government research institute in Shantou. By 2018, only two EV1s were seen at the facility, while the whereabouts of the three other EV1s were unknown.

=== Reaction and image ===
Since its demise and destruction, GM&#x27;s decision to cancel the EV1 has generated dispute and controversy. The American &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; described the EV1 as &quot;not technically a failure&quot;, whereas the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; newspaper contended that while &quot;successful, [the EV1] was doomed to fail&quot;. These opinions were due to the economic infeasibility of the EV1, and GM has been acknowledged for discontinuing the EV1, with the newspaper &quot;Automotive News&quot; asserting that this decision helped GM avoid decades of losses. But despite this praise, many criticized GM&#x27;s decision to phase out the EV1. Electric car enthusiasts, environmental interest groups, and former EV1 lessees have accused the company of self-sabotaging its electric car program to avoid potential losses in spare parts sales, while also blaming the oil industry for conspiring to keep electric cars off the road.

As car sales declined later in the decade amid the onset of global oil and financial crises, perspectives on the EV1 program underwent a shift. In 2006 Wagoner admitted that his decision to discontinue the EV1 electric-car program and neglect hybrid development was his biggest regret during his tenure at GM. He emphasized that while it didn&#x27;t directly impact profitability, it did tarnish the company&#x27;s image. Wagoner reiterated this sentiment in a National Public Radio (NPR) interview following the December 2008 Senate hearings on the U.S. auto industry bailout request. In the March 13, 2007 issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;GM R&amp;D chief Larry Burns ... now wishes GM hadn&#x27;t killed the plug-in hybrid EV1 prototype his engineers had on the road a decade ago: &#x27;If we could turn back the hands of time,&#x27; says Burns, &#x27;we could have had the [Chevrolet] Volt ten years earlier&#x27;&quot;, alluding to the Volt considered as the indirect successor to the EV1.

== Legacy and post-demise ==
The demise of the EV1 inspired the conception of the American battery electric carmaker Tesla Motors. Appalled by GM&#x27;s decision to discontinue and destroy it, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning established Tesla Motors in July 2003. Just half a year later, Elon Musk provided substantial funding and assumed the role of chairman. Musk stated in a 2017 Twitter post that &quot;Since big car companies were killing their EV programs, the only chance was to create an EV company, even though it was almost certain to fail&quot;. He stated in a subsequent tweet that it had &quot;nothing to do with government incentives or making money. I thought there was a 90 probability of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance&quot;.

Research showed that manufacturers were at least a decade behind in terms of electric vehicle adoption, technology, and infrastructure. While EV1 is considered ahead of its time, it could also be seen as a product of its era and the technologies available at that time. Lead–acid and NiMH batteries had been around for decades, aerodynamics were well understood, and electric motors were already in widespread use.

As part of GM&#x27;s vehicle electrification strategy, and following the introduction of the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid vehicle to the American market in late 2010, the Chevrolet Spark EV was launched in June 2013. It marked GM&#x27;s first all-electric passenger car release in the United States since the discontinuation of the EV1 in 1999. The Spark EV was phased out in December 2016, coinciding with the introduction of the Bolt by Chevrolet.

== In popular media ==
The EV1&#x27;s demise is explored in the 2006 documentary film titled &quot;Who Killed the Electric Car?&quot;. The film covers the history of the electric car, its modern development, and its commercialization. It addresses future concerns regarding air pollution, oil dependency, and climate change. The documentary explores various factors contributing to the EV1&#x27;s cancellation, including the CARB&#x27;s decision to reverse the mandate after pressure and lawsuits from automobile manufacturers, influence from the oil industry, anticipation surrounding a future hydrogen car, and the perfidy of the George W. Bush administration. The film extensively covers GM&#x27;s efforts to convince California that there was no demand for their product, followed by their decision to repossess and dispose of nearly every EV1 manufactured.

The news magazine &quot;Time&quot; named the EV1 as one of the &quot;50 Worst Cars of All Time&quot;. The magazine lauded its design and engineering, stating that it &quot;was a marvel of engineering [and was] absolutely the best electric vehicle anyone had ever seen&quot;, but criticized it for being very expensive to build, which led GM executives to terminating the program. They described GM as the company that &quot;killed the electric car&quot;.

<text>Sean Maher ( ; born April 16, 1975) is an American actor. He is known for his portrayal of Simon Tam in the science fiction television series &quot;Firefly&quot; and follow-up movie &quot;Serenity&quot;.

==Early life==
Maher was born in Pleasantville, New York to Joseph and Margaret Maher. After graduating from Byram Hills High School, Maher trained at New York University where he earned his drama degree in 1997. He acted on stage in several productions, including &quot;Yerma&quot; and &quot;Into the Woods&quot;.

==Career==
Maher starred as the title character, a rookie police officer, on the short-lived TV series &quot;Ryan Caulfield: Year One&quot;. In 2000 he played one of the main characters on the short-lived (dropped after seven episodes) Fox series &quot;The $treet&quot;, and he has also appeared on the television series &quot;Party of Five&quot; (as Adam Matthews) and on &quot;&quot;.

He reprised his role from &quot;Firefly&quot; in the film &quot;Serenity&quot; (2005). Maher was also cast as a chief resident in a hospital on the new series &quot;Halley&#x27;s Comet&quot;. He appeared in the 2005 Lifetime network movie &quot;The Dive From Clausen&#x27;s Pier&quot; as Michelle Trachtenberg&#x27;s new love interest. He also appeared as Brian Piccolo in the 2001 remake of &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;.

In 2006, he appeared in the television movie &quot;Wedding Wars&quot;. After taking a brief break from acting, Maher came back to TV in 2009 as a guest star in Lifetime Television&#x27;s pilot episode of &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot;, followed by 2010 guest appearances in the second season of &quot;The Mentalist&quot; (CBS), the first season of &quot;Human Target&quot; (FOX) and the second season of &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; (on Syfy).

In 2011 Maher landed a role in the television series &quot;The Playboy Club&quot;. He played Sean, a closeted gay man who is in a sham marriage with a closeted lesbian Playboy Bunny. He appeared in eight episodes, in 2011 and 2012, in another series, &quot;Make It or Break It&quot;, as the character Marcus. He played the villainous Don John in Joss Whedon&#x27;s 2012 adaptation of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

In 2014, Maher voiced Dick Grayson/Nightwing in &quot;Son of Batman&quot;, a direct-to-video animated film. It is part of the DC Universe Animated Original Movies. This was followed by the same role in &quot;Justice League vs. Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;&quot; in 2016 and &quot;Teen Titans: The Judas Contract&quot; in 2017.

==Personal life==
Maher publicly came out as gay in 2011, using his role as a closeted gay man on &quot;The Playboy Club&quot; as a platform. He and his husband Paul have two adopted children: a daughter, Sophia, and a son, Liam. Following the birth of their daughter in 2007, Maher took two years off from acting to be a stay-at-home dad.

<text>The pottos are three species of strepsirrhine primate in the genus Perodicticus of the family Lorisidae. In some English-speaking parts of Africa, they are called &quot;softly-softlys&quot;.

==Etymology==
The common name &quot;potto&quot; may be from Wolof (a tailless monkey).

The generic name &quot;Perodicticus&quot; is composed of Greek (, ‘maimed’) and (, &quot;able to show/indicate&quot;, cf. , , ‘index finger’). It refers to the stubby index finger that seems mutilated.

==Taxonomy==
There are three species recognized by the IUCN Red List and American Society of Mammalogists:


Formerly, all species were classified under one species, &quot;P. potto&quot;. However, variation among pottos is significant, prompting speculation that there may be more than one species. A 2015 study confirmed there to be three distinct potto species with deep genetic divergence dating to the Miocene for all three species.

A few closely related species also have &quot;potto&quot; in their names: the two golden potto species (also known as angwantibos) and the false potto. Although it has been suggested that the differences that separate the false potto from the West African potto are a result of an anomalous specimen being used as the holotype which may have been a West African potto.

The Central and South American kinkajou (&quot;Potos flavus&quot;) and olingos (&quot;Bassaricyon&quot; sp.) are similar in appearance and behavior to African pottos, and were formerly classified with them (hence &quot;Potos&quot;). Olingos and kinkajous are now known to be members of the raccoon family.

==Description==

The potto grows to a length of 30 to 39 cm, with a short (3 to 10 cm) tail, and its weight varies from . The close, woolly fur is grey-brown. The index finger is vestigial, although it has opposable thumbs with which it grasps branches firmly. Like other strepsirrhines the potto has a moist nose, toothcomb, and a toilet claw on the second toe of the hind legs. In the hands and feet, fingers three and four are connected to each other by a slight skin fold, while toes three through five are joined at their bases by a skin web that extends to near the proximal third of the toes.

The neck has four to six low tubercles or growths that cover its elongated vertebrae which have sharp points and nearly pierce the skin; these are used as defensive weapons. Both males and females have large scent glands under the tail (in females, the swelling created by the glands is known as a pseudo-scrotum), which they use to mark their territories and to reinforce pair bonds. The potto has a distinct odor that some observers have likened to curry.

==Distribution and habitat==
Pottos inhabit the canopy of rain forests in tropical Africa: from Nigeria, Guinea to Kenya and Uganda into the north of the Democratic Republic of Congo. They are nocturnal and arboreal, sleeping during the day in the leaves and almost never descending from the trees.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Pottos move slowly and carefully, always gripping a branch with at least two limbs. They are also quiet and avoid predators using cryptic movement. The most common call is a high-pitched &quot;tsic&quot;, which is used mainly between mother and offspring.

Studies of stomach contents have shown the potto diet consists of about 65% fruit, 21% tree gums and 10% insects. Pottos have also occasionally been known to catch bats and small birds. Their strong jaws enable it to eat fruits and lumps of dried gum that are too tough for other tree-dwellers. The insects they eat tend to have a strong smell and are generally not eaten by other animals.

Pottos have large territories which they mark with urine and glandular secretions. Same-sex intruders are vehemently guarded against, and each male&#x27;s territory generally overlaps with that of two or more females. Females have been known to donate part of their territories to their daughters, but sons leave their mother&#x27;s territory upon maturity.

As part of their courting rituals, pottos often meet for bouts of mutual grooming. This is frequently performed while they hang upside down from a branch. Grooming consists of licking, combing fur with the grooming claw and teeth, and anointing with the scent glands. Pottos mate face-to-face while hanging upside down from a branch.

After a gestation period of about 193–205 days, the female gives birth, typically to a single young, but twins are known to occur. The young first are clasped to the belly of the mother, but later she carries them on her back. She can also hide her young in the leaves while searching for food. After about six months, they are weaned, and are fully mature after about 18 months.

===Predators and defences===

Pottos have relatively few predators, because large mammalian carnivores cannot climb to the treetops where they live, and the birds of prey in this part of Africa are diurnal. Pottos living near villages face some predation from humans, who hunt them as bushmeat; the West African potto is thought to be threatened due to this. They are sometimes preyed upon by African palm civets, although African palm civets are largely frugivorous.

If threatened, the potto will hide its face and neck-butt its opponent, making use of its unusual vertebrae. It can also deliver a powerful bite. Its saliva contains compounds that cause the wound to become inflamed.

The highest recorded life span for a potto in captivity is 26 years.

===Cognition and social behaviour===
In a study of strepsirrhine cognition conducted in 1964, pottos were seen to explore and manipulate unfamiliar objects, but only when those objects were baited with food. They were found to be more curious than lorises and lesser bushbabies, but less so than lemurs. Ursula Cowgill, a biologist at Yale University who looked after six captive pottos for several decades, noticed they appeared to form altruistic relationships. The captive pottos were seen to spend time with a sick companion and to save food for an absent one. However, there is no confirmation this behaviour occurs in the wild.

<text>There was a double 2000 [[by-election]] in Glasgow Anniesland on 23 November 2000.

Donald Dewar, a leading figure in Scottish Labour politics, had in 1999 been elected to the Scottish Parliament where he had become First Minister of the Scottish Parliament, but he retained his seat in the Parliament of the United Kingdom intending to stand down at the next general election. However, Dewar died on 11 October 2000 from a massive brain haemorrhage, possibly brought on by a fall he suffered outside his official residence the previous day. This created a by-election for his seat of Glasgow Anniesland in the UK Parliament and Glasgow Anniesland in the Scottish Parliament.

Both elections were held on the same day, and polling day was set for 23 November. John Robertson had already been chosen to fight the seat for Labour at the general election and therefore stood at the by-election. The Labour vote declined, but with the main beneficiary being the small Scottish Socialist Party rather than the challenging Scottish National Party, the seat was comfortably held.

<doc id="852468" wikidata="Q6380290" url="?curid=852468" title="Kay Summersby">
<text>Kathleen Helen Summersby (née MacCarthy-Morrogh; 23 November 1908 – 20 January 1975), known as Kay Summersby, was a member of the British Mechanised Transport Corps during World War II, who served as a chauffeur and later as personal secretary to Dwight D. Eisenhower during his period as Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force in command of the Allied forces in north west Europe.

Summersby and Eisenhower spent a significant amount of time together until World War II ended, at which time Eisenhower cut ties and returned to the United States. It is generally agreed that Summersby and Eisenhower became extremely close during the war; some writers have suggested a sexual relationship between the two, although people who knew both of them at the time have rejected that claim, as have most of Eisenhower&#x27;s biographers.

==Early life==

Summersby was born in Ballydehob, County Cork, Ireland. She was the daughter of Donald Florence MacCarthy-Morrogh and Vera Mary MacCarthy-Morrogh (née Hutchinson). Her father, descended from the MacCarthy Reagh Princes of Carbery, was originally from County Kerry, and her mother was born in Wales, as the fourth of five sisters, to an English father and Irish mother who was also descended from the Morrogh family.

She described her father, a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal Munster Fusiliers, as &quot;black Irish&quot; and her mother as English. As a young woman, she moved to London where she worked as a film studio extra, dabbled in photography, and eventually became a fashion model. She was married in 1936 to British Army officer Gordon Thomas Summersby; when they divorced in 1943, she retained the name of her ex-husband, as is usual. There was an engagement to marry US Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Arnold that overlapped her initial period with Eisenhower; however, this ended with the death of her fiancé while mine clearing during the North Africa campaign.

==World War II==

When Britain entered World War II in 1939, Kay Summersby joined the British Mechanised Transport Corps (MTC). She drove an ambulance throughout the London Blitz in 1940 and 1941, and was reportedly excellent at navigating London streets during blackouts and fog. When the United States joined the Allies after the German declaration of war in December 1941, Summersby was one of many MTC drivers assigned as chauffeurs to high-ranking American military officers.

Summersby was assigned to drive then Major General Dwight Eisenhower when he arrived in London in May 1942. Though there was a brief interruption of several weeks due to Eisenhower&#x27;s short return to the US, Summersby chauffeured Eisenhower and later became his secretary until November 1945, based at his home &quot;Telegraph Cottage&quot; in Warren Road, Coombe, Kingston upon Thames. During this time Eisenhower rose in rank to a five-star General of the Army and Commander of the European Theatre, and Kay, with his help, became a US citizen and a commissioned officer in the US Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WACs), ultimately leaving the service as a captain in 1947.

Captain Summersby&#x27;s military awards included the Bronze Star Medal, Women&#x27;s Army Corps Service Medal, European Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal and the Army of Occupation Medal with &quot;Germany&quot; clasp. Although several online sources state that Summersby received the Legion of Merit, there is no known documentary evidence that she was awarded it. The Legion of Merit was normally awarded to senior officers in the rank of colonel and above.

==Life after the war==

Summersby was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 1945 New Year Honours List. The award, at the insistence of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was presented, with a signed photograph of the Prime Minister, aboard the MV &quot;Britannic&quot; in New York more than three years later.

After leaving the service in 1947, Summersby settled in the United States, and was, at one point, engaged to a man in San Francisco who thought she had money. She married the Wall Street stockbroker Reginald H. Morgan in 1952, but was divorced in 1958. She died at her home in Southampton, Long Island, of cancer, on 20 January 1975, at the age of 66.

==Relationship with Eisenhower==

There is a question whether Summersby consummated a romance with Eisenhower during the war, as there is no definitive evidence as to the matter. Many people knew both of them during the war but none alleged there was an affair. In &quot;Eisenhower Was My Boss&quot;, Summersby&#x27;s 1948 memoir of the war years, written with journalist Frank Kearns, she made no mention of any affair. Her 1975 autobiography, &quot;Past Forgetting: My Love Affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, was explicit about there being a romance, although it also said they had not actually had sexual intercourse. However, she did not dictate the text. &quot;Past Forgetting&quot; was ghostwritten by Barbara Wyden while Summersby was dying of cancer. This book was contracted after Eisenhower had died in 1969. The text states the omission of the affair from the 1948 book was due to her concern for Eisenhower&#x27;s privacy. Summersby reportedly stated shortly before her death: &quot;The General is dead. I am dying. When I wrote &quot;Eisenhower Was My Boss&quot; in 1948, I omitted many things, changed some details, glossed over others to disguise as best I could the intimacy that had grown between General Eisenhower and me. It was better that way.&quot;

Those who dispute the claim of an affair maintain that the second book&#x27;s description of the relationship was simply fabricated, presumably by the ghostwriter. By the book&#x27;s account there were two unsuccessful attempts to have intercourse. Instead of sex, wrote Summersby, the affair mostly consisted of &quot;stolen kisses&quot; during walks or on aeroplanes, holding hands, and horseback riding or golfing together. She kept a note from Eisenhower that asked, &quot;How about lunch, tea, &amp; dinner today?&quot; the note says. &quot;If yes: Who else do you want, if any? At which time? How are you?&quot; Red Cross volunteer and writer Margaret Chase was one of the authors discounting the affair in her 1983 book.

Eisenhower himself only mentioned Summersby once in &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot;, his 1948 memoir of the war, in a list of aides. Historian Carlo D&#x27;Este notes that members of Eisenhower&#x27;s staff denied that there was ever an affair between them and dismisses Summersby&#x27;s book as &quot;fanciful&quot;. However, rumours and jokes about their relationship were common among soldiers who did not know the two. Eisenhower&#x27;s son John, who briefly served as an aide, described her as &quot;the Mary Tyler Moore of headquarters. She was perky and she was cute. Whether she had any designs on the Old Man and the extent to which he succumbed, I just don&#x27;t know.&quot;

Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery wrote in his diary that &quot;Past Forgetting&quot; &quot;should have never been written, it can do Eisenhower no good. If American generals were in the habit of dealing with women secretaries and drivers as Eisenhower did and others appear to have done if this book is true, then their characters slump in the eyes of the world. This book makes it clear that Eisenhower discussed with Kay Summersby, his woman car driver, his views on Generals under him, and disclosed to her the most secret matters; all this is now given to the public in her book. Her views on world figures are enlightening, since they are obviously Eisenhower&#x27;s views.&quot;

President Harry S. Truman reportedly told author Merle Miller that in 1945, Eisenhower asked permission from General George Marshall to divorce his wife to marry Summersby, but permission was refused. Truman also allegedly said he had the correspondence between Marshall and Eisenhower retrieved from the Army archives and destroyed. However, Truman&#x27;s account of the Summersby controversy has been rejected by most scholars. Historians say Truman had a mistaken recollection and emphasize that Eisenhower had asked permission to bring his wife to England. Others have speculated that Truman was not truthful about Eisenhower because of animosity between the two men that intensified during the Eisenhower presidency (Truman stated that Eisenhower did not invite him back to the White House during his administration). Historian Robert H. Ferrell stated he found that the tapes of Miller&#x27;s interviews with Truman contain no mention whatever of Summersby, and concludes that Miller concocted the story.

Eisenhower biographer Jean Edward Smith wrote, &quot;Whether he and Kay were intimate remains a matter of conjecture. But there is no question they were in love.&quot; Smith accepted Miller&#x27;s account because Garrett Mattingly, who as a naval officer in Washington censored outgoing cables, told a similar story to his Columbia University faculty colleagues in the early 1950s. Smith cited several other people who believed in or were told of the existence of an affair. Omar Bradley in his autobiography wrote that the two were in love and that &quot;Their close relationship is quite accurately portrayed, so far as my personal knowledge extends, in Kay&#x27;s second book, &quot;Past Forgetting&quot;&quot;. James Gavin wrote that when he asked &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter John Thompson during the war whether Eisenhower and Summersby were having an affair, Thompson replied &quot;I have never before seen a chauffeur get out of a car and kiss the General good morning&quot;.

<doc id="852477" wikidata="Q2684024" url="?curid=852477" title="Buckhurst Hill">
<text>Buckhurst Hill is an affluent suburban town in Epping Forest, Essex, within the Greater London Urban Area and adjacent to the northern boundary of the London Borough of Redbridge. The area developed following the opening of a railway line in 1856, originally part of the Eastern Counties Railway and now on the Central line of the London Underground.

==History==
The first known mention of Buckhurst Hill dates back to 1135, referenced as &quot;La Bocherste&quot;, which later evolved into &quot;Bucket Hill&quot;, originally meaning a hill covered with beech trees. At that time, it lay within the bounds of Epping Forest consisting of only a few scattered houses along the ancient route connecting Woodford to Loughton. Before the building of the railways, Buckhurst Hill was on the stagecoach route between London and Cambridge, Norwich, Bury St Edmunds and Great Dunmow. Originally, Buckhurst Hill was a part of the parish of Chigwell, but with no road linking the two communities, and in order to get to church parishioners had to ford the River Roding at Woodford. 

In 1838, the Parish Church of St. John was constructed as a chapel of ease, but Buckhurst Hill did not gain status as a separate ecclesiastical parish until 1867. That same year, St John&#x27;s National School was also built adjacent to the church on land donated by the lord of the manor with the construction costing £209, largely funded by the church&#x27;s congregation. 

The opening of Buckhurst Hill station in 1856 spurred rapid population growth in the area, and by 1871, almost six hundred new houses had been built near the station. This expansion prompted the establishment Prince&#x27;s Road school in 1872, with some of the land enclosed from Epping Forest, before this practice was halted by the Epping Forest Act 1878.

In 1894, the civil parish of Buckhurst Hill became Buckhurst Hill Urban District . This status lasted until 1933, when it was merged with parish of Chigwell and Loughton Urban District to form the Chigwell Urban District. Later, in 1974, it became part of the Epping Forest District Epping Forest District after a larger merger with several other nearby districts, including Epping Urban district, Waltham Holy Cross Urban District and most of Epping and Ongar Rural District. In 1996, Buckhurst Hill Parish Council was established as a first tier of local government.

This area&#x27;s transformation was heavily influenced by transportation developments, particularly the railway, which transitioned it from a rural hamlet to a commuter suburb. The preservation efforts within Epping Forest, such as the Epping Forest Act of 1878, also played a role in defining the town&#x27;s landscape, curbing the widespread enclosure of forest land and protecting the green spaces surrounding Buckhurst Hill.

==Geography==
The town is located at the western edge of Essex, 10.7 miles (17.2 km) north-east of Charing Cross and bordering the London Borough of Redbridge. Parts of Epping Forest in Buckhurst Hill are intermingled with residential areas.

==Transport==
Buckhurst Hill is served by two London Underground stations: Buckhurst Hill (in London fare zone 5) and Roding Valley (in zone 4), which are on the Central line. The line directly links the area to central London, as well as local areas including Woodford, South Woodford, Leytonstone, Epping and Loughton.

London Overground railway services from nearby Chingford station can be used to reach London Liverpool Street, via Walthamstow and Hackney.

Most bus routes serving Buckhurst Hill are London Buses services, operated by Stagecoach London. Services link the town with Chingford, Debden, Ilford, Loughton, Walthamstow and Woodford. Bus service 397 can be used to reach Chingford station. 

==Sport==

Loughton Rugby Union Football Club has its clubhouse and pitches on Hornbeam Road at the south of the town. Buckhurst Hill F.C. is on Roding Lane at the east of the town.

Buckhurst Hill Cricket Club plays in the Shepherd Neame Essex League, and fields four Saturday XIs, two Sunday XIs, and teams in a junior section. The club plays at two cricket fields: one off Roding Lane at the east of the town; and one at the edge of Powell&#x27;s Forest (part of Epping Forest), off High Road at the north of the town.
==Education==
Primary schools include Buckhurst Hill Community (BHCPS), St John&#x27;s (Church of England) and Whitebridge. 

Roding Valley High School in Loughton provides secondary level education for the area. It was formed by the merger of three schools: Loughton County High School for Girls, Buckhurst Hill County High School (for boys) and Epping Forest High School.

Braeside and Daiglen are independent schools.

<doc id="852480" wikidata="Q2369770" url="?curid=852480" title="Foekje Dillema">
<text>Foekje Dillema (; 18 September 19265 December 2007) was a Dutch track and field athlete. She competed in sprinting where she was a rival of Fanny Blankers-Koen. When she refused a sex verification test at age 24, she was banned from competition by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1950. After her death, it was determined that she was an intersex person.

==Early life==
Foekje Dillema was born on 18 September 1926 in Burum, Friesland in the Netherlands.

She started running at the age of twelve.

==Career==
===1948===
On 13 June 1948, Dillema debuted in Marsum, where the 21-year-old ran the 100 metres in 13 s.

About a month later, she competed in the Dutch Championships in Eindhoven, where she ran 12.5 s in the 100 metres, resulting in 4th place in the heats, and 26.2 s in the 200 metres, resulting in 4th place in the final.

===1949===
In 1949, Dillema did not compete in the Dutch Championships due to an injury of her thigh.

Dillema was named &quot;athlete of the match&quot; in 1949 after winning the 100 metres and 200 metres race during a tournament in London. She was an important rival for another Dutch athlete Fanny Blankers-Koen, who won four gold medals during the 1948 Summer Olympics and who was voted &quot;Female Athlete of the Century&quot; by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in 1999.

===1950===


In 1950, Dillema was banned from competition for life by the IAAF. Dillema had refused to go to a mandatory sex test for the European championships in Brussels in August 1950. Dillema was the first subject of a mandatory gender verification. The IAAF introduced mandatory sex verification in 1950 and continued this practice until 1992. Dillema&#x27;s national record of 24.1 seconds for the 200 metres was erased.

On 13 July 1950, Dillema was stopped on her way to an international meeting in France by the Dutch athletics authorities and expelled for life from competition.

==After the ban==
After Dillema was banned from competition, she returned home to Friesland and did not leave her house for at least one year. She lived a quiet life in her home town afterwards and always refused to speak on the subject.

She died on 5 December 2007 in Kollum, Netherlands.

==Posthumous testing==
Dillema, having the typical female phenotype, was designated female at birth, raised as a girl and lived her life as a woman. After her death, a forensic test on body cells obtained from her clothing showed signs of a Y-chromosome in her DNA. She may have been a genetic mosaic, having cells with either 46,XX (female) or 46,XY (male) chromosomes, in approximately a one-to-one ratio, in her skin. The forensic report speculated that Dillema developed from a zygote with an XXY genotype that promptly divided into a half XX, half XY embryo through nondisjunction. Dillema was probably a 46XX/46XY woman. This is also known as ovotesticular disorder of sex development (DSD) or true hermaphroditism.

Her biographer Max Dohle concludes that Dillema, having a Y-chromosome, would never have been allowed to race in the last 45 years. The Barr body test (1966) as well as the test based on PCR (1992) scanned for a Y-chromosome or an SRY-gene on the Y-chromosome. All female athletes with a Y-chromosome were expelled from competition from 1966 until 2011.

Dohle concludes that Dillema was an intersex individual who had ovotesticular DSD. She had an operation on her glands in 1952. During the operation, testes or ovotestes were removed. The SRY-gene on the Y is the testis determining factor, so Dillema may have had infertile testes or ovotestes palpable in her groin. These ovotestes produce more testosterone than ovaries. Higher testosterone levels were considered unfair towards the competition, despite being an entirely natural feature of Dillema&#x27;s physiology.

==Rehabilitation==
Shortly after Dillema&#x27;s death, the director of the Royal Dutch Athletics Federation apologized to her family for the manner of her suspension and her personal best in the 200 metres was reinstated.

In 2014, Ids Willemsma made a sculpture commemorating Dillema, currently installed in Leeuwarden.

In Amsterdam, a street was named after her.

<doc id="852481" wikidata="Q6544583" url="?curid=852481" title="Life-like cellular automaton">
<text>A cellular automaton (CA) is  (in the sense of being similar to Conway&#x27;s Game of Life) if it meets the following criteria:

* The array of cells of the automaton has two dimensions.
* Each cell of the automaton has two states (conventionally referred to as &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;dead&quot;, or alternatively &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;)
* The neighborhood of each cell is the Moore neighborhood; it consists of the eight adjacent cells to the one under consideration and (possibly) the cell itself.
* In each time step of the automaton, the new state of a cell can be expressed as a function of the number of adjacent cells that are in the alive state and of the cell&#x27;s own state; that is, the rule is &quot;outer totalistic&quot; (sometimes called &quot;semitotalistic&quot;).

This class of cellular automata is named for the Game of Life (B3/S23), the most famous cellular automaton, which meets all of these criteria. Many different terms are used to describe this class. It is common to refer to it as the &quot;Life family&quot; or to simply use phrases like &quot;similar to Life&quot;.

==Notation for rules==
There are three standard notations for describing these rules, that are similar to each other but incompatible. use the Wolfram code, a decimal number the binary representation of which has bits that correspond to each possible number of neighbors and state of a cell; the bits of this number are zero or one accordingly as a cell with that neighborhood is dead or alive in the next generation. The other two notations unpack the same sequence of bits into a string of characters that is more easily read by a human.

In the notation used by Mirek&#x27;s Cellebration, a rule is written as a string x/y where each of x and y is a sequence of distinct digits from 0 to 8, in numerical order. The presence of a digit &quot;d&quot; in the x string means that a live cell with &quot;d&quot; live neighbors survives into the next generation of the pattern, and the presence of &quot;d&quot; in the y string means that a dead cell with &quot;d&quot; live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation. For instance, in this notation, Conway&#x27;s Game of Life is denoted 23/3.

In the notation used by the Golly open-source cellular automaton package and in the RLE format for storing cellular automaton patterns, a rule is written in the form By/Sx where x and y are the same as in the MCell notation. Thus, in this notation, Conway&#x27;s Game of Life is denoted B3/S23. The &quot;B&quot; in this format stands for &quot;birth&quot; and the &quot;S&quot; stands for &quot;survival&quot;.

== A selection of rules ==


There are 218 = 262,144 possible rules, only a small fraction of which have been studied in any detail.
In the descriptions below, all rules are specified in Golly/RLE format.


Several more rules are listed and described in the MCell rule list and by , including some rules with B0 in which the background of the field of cells alternates between live and dead at each step.

Any automaton of the above form that contains the element B1 (e.g. B17/S78, or B145/S34) will always be explosive for any finite pattern: at any step, consider the cell (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) that has minimum &quot;x&quot;-coordinate among cells that are on, and among such cells the one with minimum &quot;y&quot;-coordinate. Then the cell (&quot;x&quot;-1,&quot;y&quot;-1) must have exactly one neighbor, and will become on in the next step. Similarly, the pattern must grow at each step in each of the four diagonal directions. Thus, any nonempty starting pattern leads to explosive growth.

Any automaton of the above form that does not include any of B0, B1, B2 or B3 cannot support movement or expansion of patterns because any cell outside a rectangular building box containing the pattern has at most three on neighbours. Most finite patterns in rules whose notation begins with B2, and all finite patterns in rules beginning with B1, grow in all directions rather than remaining of bounded size, with a front that moves at the speed of light. Thus, the remaining &quot;interesting&quot; rules are the ones beginning with B3 (Game of Life, Highlife, Morley, 2x2, Day&amp;Night) or beginning with B0 (and not including S8, as otherwise the dual can be studied instead).

==Generalizations==
There are other cellular automata which are inspired by the Game of Life, but which do not fit the definition of
&quot;&quot; given in this article, because their neighborhoods are larger than the Moore neighborhood, or
they are defined on three-dimensional lattices, or they use a different lattice topology. For example:

*&quot;Non-totalistic rules&quot; depend on the configuration of live cells in the neighborhood.
**&quot;Non-isotropic rules&quot; that behave differently in different directions. There are 2512≈1.34*10154 rules of this kind, including isotropic rules.
**&quot;Isotropic non-totalistic rules&quot; behave identically under rotation and reflection. There are 2102≈5.07*1030 rules of this kind, including outer-totalistic rules.
*&quot;Generations&quot; rules include one or more &quot;dying&quot; states cells switch to instead of instantly dying. The most famous examples in this category are the rules &quot;Brian&#x27;s Brain&quot; (B2/S/3) and &quot;Star Wars&quot; (B2/S345/4). Random patterns in these two rules feature a large variety of spaceships and rakes with a speed of c, often crashing and combining into even more objects.
*&quot;Larger than Life&quot; is a family of cellular automata studied by Kellie Michele Evans. They have very large radius neighborhoods, but perform &quot;birth/death&quot; thresholding similar to Conway&#x27;s life. These automata have eerily organic &quot;glider&quot; and &quot;blinker&quot; structures.
*&quot;RealLife&quot; is the continuum limit of Evan&#x27;s Larger Than Life CA, in the limit as the neighborhood radius goes to infinity, while the lattice spacing goes to zero. Technically, they are not cellular automata at all, because the underlying &quot;space&quot; is the continuous Euclidean plane R2, not the discrete lattice Z2. They have been studied by Marcus Pivato.
*&quot;Lenia&quot; is a family of continuous cellular automata created by Bert Wang-Chak Chan. The space, time and states of the Game of Life are generalized to continuous domains, using large neighborhoods, fractional updates, and real number states, respectively.
*Carter Bays has proposed a variety of generalizations of the Game of Life to three-dimensional CA defined on Z3 (3D Life). Bays has also studied two-dimensional CA with triangular or hexagonal neighborhoods.

<doc id="852482" wikidata="Q1130864" url="?curid=852482" title="Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge">
<text>The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK) was founded in London in 1826, mainly at the instigation of Whig MP Henry Brougham, with the object of publishing information to people who were unable to obtain a formal education or who preferred self-education. It was a largely Whig organisation, and published inexpensive texts intended to adapt scientific and similarly high-minded material for the rapidly-expanding reading public over twenty years until it was disbanded in 1846.

== Origins ==

Henry Brougham considered that mass education was an essential prerequisite for political reform. In October 1824 he contributed an article on &quot;scientific education of the people&quot; to the Whig &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, in which he argued that popular education would be greatly enhanced by the encouragement of cheap publications to complement the numerous recently founded provincial mechanics&#x27; institutes. The following year a version of this article was issued as a pamphlet entitled &quot;Practical Observations upon the Education of the People Addressed to the Working Classes and Their Employers&quot;, selling at least 19 editions. In April 1825 Brougham set about trying to found a society to produce cheap educational books, although it was not until November 1826 that the SDUK was formally founded.
One of those present at the first meeting was the philosopher James Mill, and the founding committee included many Fellows of the Royal Society and Members of Parliament, as well as twelve founding committee members of the newly formed University College London.

==Aims==
SDUK publications were intended for the working class and the middle class, as an antidote to the more radical output of the pauper presses. The Society set out to achieve this by acting as an intermediary between authors and publishers by launching several series of publications. Its printers included Baldwin &amp; Cradock, later succeeded by Charles Knight. The SDUK commissioned work and dealt with the printers, and finally distributed the publications; profits were used to continue the Society&#x27;s work. By using the new technologies of mass production, such as steam presses and stereotype, the Society and its printers kept costs low and were able to sell the books at much cheaper prices than was usual.

The Society was not without opposition, and the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; mounted a campaign on behalf of the book trade, supported by publications such as the &quot;Royal Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, who complained in the early 1830s that:
Few persons are aware that the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge have done, and are still doing, more to ruin the Book trade than all the change of times, the want of money, the weight of taxes, and even the law of Libel have accomplished; yet they – a committee of Noblemen and pretended Patriots – are permitted to go on in their unfeeling, nay, considering the hundreds of thousands engaged in the Book trade, we may add brutal, career, without interruption.

==Activities==
The SDUK publishing programme began with the &quot;Library of Useful Knowledge&quot;. Sold for sixpence and published fortnightly, its books focused on scientific topics. Like many other works in the new genre of popular science—such as the &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot; and Humphry Davy&#x27;s &quot;Consolations in Travel&quot;—the books of the &quot;Library of Useful Knowledge&quot; imbued different scientific fields with concepts of progress: uniformitarianism in geology, the nebular hypothesis in astronomy, and the scala naturae in the life sciences. According to historian James A. Secord, such works met a demand for &quot;general concepts and simple laws&quot;, and in the process helped establish the authority of professional science and specialised scientific disciplines.

The first volume of the &quot;Library of Useful Knowledge&quot;, an introduction to the series by Brougham on the &quot;objects, advantages and pleasures of science&quot;, sold over 33,000 copies by the end of 1829. Despite the initial success of the series, however, it soon became clear that it was too demanding for many readers, and the Society began to offer more varied and attractive publications, starting with the &quot;Library of Entertaining Knowledge&quot; (1829–38) and the &quot;Penny Magazine&quot; (1832–1845), a lavishly illustrated weekly that achieved unprecedented success, with sales in excess of 200,000 copies in the first year. The scope and scale of the Society&#x27;s activities expanded further over the following decade, and included the production of a &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot; (1833–1843) in 27 volumes. 

Although sales of these publications may have been more among the middle- than the working-classes, the Society had a significant role in pioneering &quot;the idea of cheap, improving publications, freely and easily available, well produced and distributed on a scale hitherto unknown,&quot; and became iconic of the &quot;March of Intellect&quot;. The publisher Charles Knight bears much of the credit for the success that SDUK publications had; he engaged in extensive promotional campaigns, and worked to improve the readability of the sometimes abstruse material. 

The Society&#x27;s continuing commitment to the high intellectual standards with which it was conceived probably contributed to its ultimate decline, as subscribers and sale of publications fell away. The &quot;Biographical Dictionary&quot; begun in 1842 was immensely ambitious and contributed to the Society&#x27;s demise.

==In popular culture==
*Thomas Love Peacock satirised the SDUK in 1831 in &quot;Crotchet Castle&quot; as the &#x27;Steam Intellect Society&#x27;: a vicarage is almost set on fire by a &quot;cook taking it into her head to study hydrostatics, in a sixpenny tract, published by the Steam Intellect Society&quot;.
*In the Notes to Anthony Trollope&#x27;s book, &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;, published by Oxford University Press as a World&#x27;s Classic in 1980, P. D. Edwards writes that Trollope&#x27;s character, Lord Boanerges, &quot;may have been modelled in some respects on Lord Brougham... founder of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge&quot;.
*References to the Society are rare in the modern era, but within Steampunk culture, it is not entirely uncommon to refer to the Society itself and/or its better-known publications in an attempt to lend Victorian verisimilitude. The in-house publishing organ of the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles is called the Society for the Diffusion of Useful &quot;Information&quot;; while many communities in North America have established Societies for Learning in Retirement which are partially modelled along the same lines with the goal of disseminating knowledge amongst people who, although retired, are still interested in continuing to learn.
*The Blackwood Gallery, a contemporary art gallery at the University of Toronto Mississauga, has published a series of free print and PDF broadsheets since 2018, which adopt the SDUK moniker. These publications reflect on contemporary issues in the arts, humanities, and social sciences by questioning the nature of “useful knowledge,” in dialogue with the history of the SDUK.

An independent Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge was founded as part of the Lyceum movement in the United States in 1829. It sponsored lectures by such speakers as Ralph Waldo Emerson and was active from 1829 to 1947. Later, an independent American Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge was founded, which published a fifty-volume set of books called &quot;The American School Library&quot;. Henry David Thoreau cites the Society in his essay &quot;Walking&quot; in which he jestingly proposes a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Ignorance.

== Collections ==
The archives of the Society are held by University College London, having been deposited by the Society after it closed in 1848. The archive spans 200 volumes and 121 boxes. It includes minutes, financial records, unpublished manuscripts, and correspondence.

University College London also holds the papers of the Society&#x27;s founder, Henry Brougham. The papers consist primarily of Brougham&#x27;s incoming correspondence, totalling around 50,000 items, and material relating to his legal and political career.

<doc id="852483" wikidata="Q297853" url="?curid=852483" title="Øresund Region">
<text>The Øresund Region ( ; ), also known as the Greater Copenhagen Region for marketing purposes, is a transnational metropolitan region encompassing the Capital Region and Region Zealand in eastern Denmark and Region Skåne and Region Halland in southern Sweden. Centred around the Øresund strait and the two cities which lie on either side, Copenhagen in Denmark and Malmö in Sweden, the region is connected by the Øresund Bridge, which spans the strait at its southern end, and the HH Ferry route between Helsingør, Denmark, and Helsingborg, Sweden, at the narrowest point of the strait.

The region has a population of app. 4.5 million (2023) and a population density of . The Øresund Region consists of both rural and urban areas. Areas on the periphery of the region have a relatively low population density, whereas the two metropolitan areas of Copenhagen and Malmö are two of the most densely populated in Scandinavia. Helsingborg also forms an important urban hub on the Swedish side.

==Cross-border activity==
The Øresund Region is an important hub for economic activity in Scandinavia.

In 2007, almost 25 million people traveled over the Øresund Bridge: 15.2 million by car and bus, and 9.6 million by train. By 2009, the figure had risen to a total of 35.6 million travellers by car, coach, train or ferry.

Statistics compiled in January 2007 show 14,000 people commuting each day over the Öresund Bridge. Compared with 2005, the commuter traffic increased by 43% in 2006. The growing number of Swedes commuting in order to take advantage of the need for labour on the job market in Copenhagen and the higher salaries offered in Denmark, as well as an increased immigration of Danes to the south of Sweden, were essential factors in the traffic increase. In 2006, 4,300 persons moved from the Danish part of the Øresund Region to Scania, attracted by lower Scanian real estate prices. Since July 2000, 22,500 Danes have moved to Scania.

Apart from work related commuting, Swedes cross over to Copenhagen to enjoy shopping and nightlife, to attend cultural and educational institutions and to use Copenhagen Airport. The largest airport in Scania, Malmö Airport is located 47 km (29.2 mi) from Copenhagen Airport and has limited international air traffic.

After the opening of the bridge in 2000, an &#x27;Öresund identity&#x27; has been promoted in the region in order to counter-act various barriers to cross-border cooperation caused by nationalistic sentiments on both sides. In 1997, a consortium of twelve universities (four Swedish and eight Danish) from both sides of the Sound has been established, opening up all courses, libraries and other facilities to all students, teachers and researchers from the region. The universities have 150,000 students and more than 14,000 researchers combined. The secretariat is located at Lund University and at the University of Copenhagen.

The commercial interaction across the border has also significantly increased. In 2018, an average of 19,100 vehicles crossed the bridge each day.

The ports of Copenhagen and Malmö were merged in 2001 to form a single company, Copenhagen Malmö Port. This cross-border merger of two ports into one legal entity is the first in history, according to Copenhagen Malmö Port AB, the Swedish registered limited liability company operating the port, a company equally owned by Port of Copenhagen and Port of Malmö.

In May 2018 the Øresundsmetro Executive was announced, formed of representatives from the two cities, industry and researchers, to explore the proposal to link Copenhagen and Malmö via a driverless metro system, with travel time of around 20 minutes compared to 35 minutes by train.

According to the population registry, as of 2023, 12,872 Swedes live in the Danish regions of the Øresund region and 19,540 Danes in Scania as of 2021. While the number of Swedes in the Danish regions has steadily increased from 10,507 in 2008, the number of Danes living in Scania has decreased from nearly 24,000 in 2009 to 19,540 in 2021. 7,564 Danes live in Malmö, 2,052 in Helsingborg and 862 in Lund, while 5,539 Swedes live in Copenhagen, 937 in Frederiksberg and over 500 in both Gentofte and Helsingør.

==Political and administrative structure==
In 1993, local, regional and national authorities established the Øresund Committee as a regional policy forum. In 2016, as a compromise, following the debate about the name change, it was initially renamed The Greater Copenhagen &amp; Skåne Committee. When Halland joined the colleboration, its name was shortened to the Greater Copenhagen Committee. The forum consists of 18 politicians, whose election periods differ as they comply with the functional period for the various authorities they represent.

The committee is legally a member organization funded by its members and by the Nordic Council through external project funding. The European Union cross-border projects have supported the region through Interreg II (1994–1999) and Interreg IIIA, operative since the end of 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;RP11/03&quot;&gt;Greve, Bent and Maj Rydbjerg. &quot;Research Paper no. 11/03: Cross-Border Commuting in the EU: Obstacles and Barriers. Country Report: The Øresund Region.&quot; Roskilde University, 2003, . Available in pdf format from Roskilde University. Retrieved 22 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, an EU-funded EURORES project was launched in the region in order to promote a common labor market.

In 2020, Tue David Bak assumed the position as managing director of Greater Copenhagen&#x27;s secretariate in Copenhagen.

===Members of the Greater Copenhagen Committee===
As of April 2024, Greater Copenhagen Committee had the following 18 members:
;Executive committee
* Lars Gaardhøj (Chairman), Chairman of the Capital Region of Denmark
* Carl Johan Sonesson, Chair of Skåne Regional Council
* Sophie Hæstorp Andersen, Lord Mayor of Copenhagen
* Mikaela Waltersson, Chair of Halland Regional Council
* Mikael Smed (voce chairman), chair of KKR Sjælland
;Other members
* Pernille Beckmann, Mayor of Greve Municipality
* Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, Mayor of Malmö
* Christian Orsing, Mayor of Helsingborg
* Camilla Palm, Mayor of Kristianstad
* Henrik Fritzon, Zealand Tegional Council member
* Steen Christiansen, Chairman of KKR Hovedstaden
* Anders Almgren, Mayor of Lund
* Patric Åberg, Chair of Skånes kommuner
* Randi Mondorf, Capital Regional Council member
* Heino Knudsen, Region Sjælland chairman
* Jan Hendeliowitz, Zealand Regional County member
* Karsten Längerich, Mayor of Allerød Municipality

==Challenges==
One deterrent to closer economic integration is the lack of a single currency, as both Sweden and Denmark maintain their own currencies, the Danish krone and Swedish krona, although both are accepted in some areas of the other country.

Another problem has been a lack of transparency of the rules for taxes, social security, pension and unemployment benefits. While specific tax treaties exist for the region, there are still problems with administering them. People commuting to work over the border (, ) had a problem receiving information of rules affecting them and sometimes risked paying double taxes. They also risked losing the right to unemployment benefits because foreign employment did not contribute to entitlements in their home state, losing the right to kindergarten for their small children for the same reason etc. Some of these problems have been solved after the recent years of political coordination between the countries, but the local tax authorities have difficulties implementing the complex rules for cross-border taxation.

An imbalance in the municipal budgets is also a problem, since the flow of commuters move mostly in one direction: from the residential side in Sweden to the labor market side in Denmark. Rules of taxation have left the Scanian municipalities with increased costs not covered by increased tax revenues from the growing commuter population mainly taxed in the country of employment.

A fourth problem is voting privileges; Danes living in the Swedish part of the Øresund Region, but working in the Danish part, lose their right to vote in general elections in Denmark even if they work in Denmark.

<text>The 2000 Falkirk West by-election was a parliamentary by-election held on 21 December 2000 for the Scottish constituency of Falkirk West. It was the last by-election to be held before the 2001 general election.

The vacancy was caused by the resignation from the UK House of Commons of Dennis Canavan, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Falkirk West. Canavan had first been elected for West Stirlingshire in the October 1974 election as a Labour Party candidate, and had held that seat until its abolition in 1983. He had then won the new Falkirk West seat, and held that seat as a Labour MP until he was expelled from Labour in 1999. He then sat as an Independent until he resigned on 21 November 2000 by accepting the office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead.

A by-election to fill the seat was held on 21 December. The Scottish National Party mounted a strong challenge, but fell 705 votes short of winning.

<doc id="852491" wikidata="Q702207" url="?curid=852491" title="First Viennese School">
<text>The First Viennese School is a name mostly used to refer to three composers of the Classical period in Western art music in late-18th-century to early-19th-century Vienna: Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven. Sometimes, Franz Schubert is added to the list.

In German-speaking countries, the term &quot;Wiener Klassik&quot; (lit. &quot;Viennese classical era/art&quot;) is used. That term is often more broadly applied to the Classical era in music as a whole, as a means to distinguish it from other periods that are colloquially referred to as &quot;classical&quot;, namely Baroque and Romantic music.

The term &quot;Viennese School&quot; was first used by Austrian musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter, in 1834, although he only counted Haydn and Mozart as members of the school. Other writers followed suit and eventually Beethoven was added to the list. The designation &quot;first&quot; is added today to avoid confusion with the Second Viennese School.

These composers sometimes encountered each other: Haydn and Mozart were even occasional chamber-music partners. Beethoven for a time received lessons from Haydn, probably heard Mozart play, and met Schubert a few times (see Beethoven and his contemporaries). However, they did not form a school in the sense of a deliberate co-operation associated with 20th-century schools, such as the Second Viennese School, or Les Six. Nor is there any evidence (other than Haydn teaching Beethoven) that one composer was &quot;schooled&quot; by another, in the way that Berg and Webern were taught by Schoenberg.

Attempts to extend the First Viennese School to include such later figures as Anton Bruckner, Johannes Brahms, and Gustav Mahler are merely journalistic, and never encountered in academic musicology. According to scholar James F. Daugherty, the Classical period itself from approximately 1775 to 1825 is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Viennese Classic period&quot;.

<doc id="852497" wikidata="Q893071" url="?curid=852497" title="Boonesborough, Kentucky">
<text>Boonesborough or Boonesboro is an unincorporated community in Madison County, Kentucky, United States. Founded by famed frontiersman Daniel Boone in 1775 as one of the first English-speaking settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains, Boonesborough lies in the central part of the state along the Kentucky River and is the site of Fort Boonesborough State Park, which includes the Kentucky River Museum. The park site has been rebuilt to look like a working fort of the time that Boone resided there.

Boonesborough is part of the Richmond-Berea micropolitan area. It is located at the junction of Kentucky Route 388 and Kentucky Route 627.

==History==

Boonesborough was founded as Boone&#x27;s Station by the frontiersman Daniel Boone while working for Richard Henderson and Nathanial Hart of the Transylvania Company. Boone led a group of settlers (which included a number of African Americans) through the mountains from Fort Watauga (present-day Elizabethton in Tennessee), carving the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap, and established Fort Boonesborough. Boone lived there from 1775 to 1779. The region was at that time part of the Commonwealth of Virginia, which officially chartered Boonesborough in October 1779. It was one of the first English-speaking communities west of the Appalachian Mountains. Boone successfully led his fellow settlers during the Siege of Boonesborough in 1778. He then moved to his son Israel&#x27;s settlement at Boone&#x27;s New Station near present-day Athens, Kentucky.

Although the town served as a for pioneers venturing further into Kentucky during the 1780s and 1790s, it never attracted a significant long-term population, and thus slowly declined. By 1877, Boonesborough had &quot;almost disappeared as a village&quot;.

<doc id="852500" wikidata="Q3281823" url="?curid=852500" title="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums">
<text>British Hit Singles &amp; Albums (originally known as The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums) was a music reference book originally published in the United Kingdom by the publishing arm of the Guinness breweries, Guinness Superlatives. Later editions were published by HiT Entertainment (who had bought the Guinness World Records brand). It listed all the singles and albums featured in the Top 75 pop charts in the UK. In 2004 the book became an amalgamation of two earlier Guinness publications, originally known as British Hit Singles and British Hit Albums. The publication of this amalgamation ceased in 2006, with Guinness World Records being sold to The Jim Pattison Group, owner of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;. At this point, the Official UK Charts Company teamed up with Random House/Ebury Publishing to release a new version of the book under the Virgin Books brand. Entitled &quot;The Virgin Book of British Hit Singles&quot;, it was first published in November 2008 with a separate albums book and second edition being published over the next couple of years.

The first ten editions of &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot; were compiled by Paul Gambaccini, Mike Read and brothers Tim Rice and Jonathan (Jo) Rice (known as GRRR). Read left the team in the mid-1980s (with the book copyright now belonging to GRR Publications Ltd) and the other editors resigned in 1996. Chart editor for many editions was David Roberts.

==Content==

&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; was generally considered to be the authoritative reference (and only) source for both the UK Singles Chart (since its inception in 1952) and the UK Albums Chart. It listed all the singles and albums ever to have been in the UK charts since 1952 (albums since 1958), listing them in alphabetical order and by both artist and song title. The entries also included the date of chart entry, highest position, catalogue number and number of weeks in the chart. Short biographical notes accompanied many of the artists&#x27; chart details.

The book&#x27;s sources are the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) chart from November 1952 to March 1960, and the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; (later &quot;Music Week&quot;) chart thereafter. It could be said that this division is misleading, since the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart was little known until it was adopted by the BBC in 1969 and that by adopting this chart as its standard, the editors had a non-consensual view. An example often given is the case of The Beatles&#x27; second single &quot;Please Please Me&quot; which was recognised as a number one hit by every other publicly available chart of the time, but not by &quot;Record Retailer&quot; and therefore not by &quot;British Hit Singles&quot;. Other records to which this applies include &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot; by The Rolling Stones, &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; by Acker Bilk and the Eurovision Song Contest entry &quot;Are You Sure?&quot; by The Allisons.

Even after February 1969 the BBC-approved chart, as used by the Book of British Hit Singles, suffered from errors. Reasons for these include low, late, unusable, or even complete lack of returns from record shops used to compile the chart. Typically only around 10% of stores sent in properly detailed sales information on time. The other major problem was &quot;chart hyping&quot;. There were two main forms of this. The first was for record companies, or artists&#x27; management, to simply buy positions for their records in the Hit Parade. The second was, knowing that only 10% of sampled stores reliably sent in sales info, to find out which stores those were, and then send in &quot;customers&quot; to buy out all the stock of a particular record in those specific stores in a particular week, thus artificially giving that record a high chart placing. As such, even through the 70s and 80s many books on British chart history referred to the New Musical Express and/or Melody Maker chart.

Co-founder Jo Rice has defended the book&#x27;s choice of source material on the grounds that &quot;Record Retailer&quot; was the only chart to consistently publish a Top 50 from 1960 onwards. This can be substantiated by the fact that charts published in the &quot;NME&quot; were of a shorter format and other chart listings such as those in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, became less and less informative although they were probably more accurate. Subsequent research has shown that during the &quot;disputed&quot; period of the 1960s, the samples sizes of the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart were considerably inferior to those of the other charts: around 30 shops in 1963 in comparison to more than 100 used by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, and later around 80 in comparison to &quot;NME&quot;″s 150 and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s 200. As a result, the placings in that chart were more open to error and manipulation – a situation further worsened by the larger number of records listed in the chart.

==History==

===1977–96 original editors===

The first edition was published as &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot; in November 1977. It was not the first Guinness music reference publication, as the previous year a book called &quot;The Guinness Book of Music Facts &amp; Feats&quot; had been published. It also contained feats from the world of classical music.

The first edition was issued to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the first UK singles sales chart, which was published in November 1952, by the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;. Subsequently, a new edition was published every two years, adding a few hundred titles to each edition.

Keeping in line with the book&#x27;s parent publication &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot;, each edition of &quot;British Hit Singles&quot; also contained a &#x27;facts and feats&#x27; section, which included various lists of remarkable chart feats such as &#x27;most hits&#x27;, &#x27;most no. 1 hits&#x27;, &#x27;most weeks on chart&#x27; or &#x27;Least successful chart artist&#x27;. Also included in the books were photographs (often with captions) and introductions written by the four authors. They also wrote a bi-annual lookback on the major developments in the UK charts in the two preceding years.

The series was soon regarded as the number one source for music and chart reference, thanks to the commercial success of the books and its various sister publications (see below).

The series&#x27; 10th edition, published in June 1995, was the last to feature its original authors Rice, Rice and Gambaccini. From the 11th edition onwards, the book was compiled by in-house editors at Guinness Publishing and, later, by David Roberts who had already been a chart editor and designer for the original team.

===1997–2006===
From the 12th edition onwards (published in 1999), the book was published every year rather than bi-annually. In 2004, the book merged with &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums&quot; to form &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;. The eighteenth edition of the book (2005) was billed as a &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; as it featured detailed information on the 1,000 Number Ones in the UK Singles Chart from Al Martino&#x27;s &quot;Here in My Heart&quot; on 14 November 1952 to Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;One Night / I Got Stung&quot; (Limited Edition Collector&#x27;s re-issue), 22 January 2005.
The 19th edition (2006) was the last in the series. A supposed 20th edition was due to be published in 2007, but apparently the original publishers lost interest in chart reference books after their contract with The Official Charts Company expired, which saw that organisation sell the contract to Virgin.

===Features in each edition===
==Associated merchandise==
Following the success of the &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot; series, the original authors and Guinness quickly turned to other charts-related books and projects. The following books were written by them:
* &quot;The Guinness Book of Hits of the 70s&quot; (1980)
* &quot;The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits&quot; (1982)
* &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums&quot; (first issued in 1983, second edition in 1986 with bi-annual updates until 1996)
* &quot;The Guinness Book of Hits of the 60s&quot; (1984)
* &quot;The Guinness Hits Challenge&quot; (a pop quiz book) (1984)
* &quot;The Guinness Hits Challenge 2&quot; (1985)
* &quot;The Guinness Book of Number One Hits (2nd edition)&quot; (1988)
* &quot;UK Top 1000 Singles&quot; (1988)
* &quot;Hits of the 80s&quot; (1990)
* &quot;The Guinness Hits Quiz&quot; (1990)
* &quot;Guinness Top 40 Charts&quot; (1992)
* &quot;The Guinness Hits Quiz 2&quot; (1992)

* &quot;The Guinness Book of Number One Hits (3rd edition)&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Guinness Top 40 Charts 2&quot; (1996)

In the late 1990s and 2000s several other merchandise was produced, such as karaoke CDs, a calendar, a DVD quiz (&quot;British Hit Albums and Singles No. 1 Music Quiz&quot;) and a series of themed compilation CDs with original hits from the book.

<doc id="852502" wikidata="Q3559545" url="?curid=852502" title="Julie Chen Moonves">
<text>Julie Suzanne Chen Moonves ( Chen; born January 6, 1970) is an American television personality, news anchor, and producer for CBS. She has been the host of the American version of the CBS reality-television program &quot;Big Brother&quot; since its debut in July 2000.

From 2002 to 2010, she was a co-anchor of &quot;The Early Show&quot; on CBS. In 2004, Chen married CBS executive Les Moonves. Starting in 2010, Chen Moonves was a co-host and the moderator of the CBS Daytime talk show &quot;The Talk&quot;, until 2018 when she left the show following multiple sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against her husband Les Moonves that came to light. Following this, she began using her married name with the September 13, 2018 episode of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, signing off with, &quot;I&#x27;m Julie Chen Moonves, goodnight.&quot; This broke her established pattern of previously signing off simply as, &quot;Julie Chen.&quot;

In 2018, Chen Moonves authored her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;, dedicated to her son, Charlie.

==Early life and education==
The daughter of Chinese immigrants, Julie Chen was born in Queens, New York City. Chen&#x27;s mother, Wang Ling Chen, grew up in Rangoon, Burma. Her father, David Chen, was born in China, and subsequently fled to Taiwan following the Chinese Civil War. Chen&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Lou Gaw Tong, grew up &quot;dirt poor&quot; in the rural village of Penglai in Fujian province of China, and became wealthy through a chain of grocery stores and ultimately became a polygamist with nine wives and 11 children. Julie has two older sisters, Gladys and Victoria.

Chen attended junior high school in the Whitestone area of Queens. Chen went on to graduate from St. Francis Preparatory School in 1987. She attended the University of Southern California and graduated in 1991, majoring in broadcast journalism and English.

==Career==
One of her earlier jobs came in June 1990, interning alongside Andy Cohen at &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; the series which she would anchor a decade later where she answered phones and copied faxes for distribution. The following year, while still in school, she worked for ABC NewsOne for one season as a desk assistant. She was subsequently promoted to work as a producer for the next three years. The following year, she relocated to Dayton, Ohio, to work as a local news reporter for WDTN-TV, from 1995 to 1997.

In 2015, Chen revealed on &quot;The Talk&quot; that during her time in Dayton her news director had told her that she would never become a news anchor because of her &quot;Asian eyes.&quot; After a &quot;big-time agent&quot; agreed and advised her to get plastic surgery, she made the decision to have a surgical procedure to reduce the epicanthic folds of her eyes.

From 1999 to 2002, Chen was the anchor of &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; and news anchor of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; and later &quot;The Early Show&quot;, alongside Bryant Gumbel, Jane Clayson, Hannah Storm, Harry Smith, Maggie Rodriguez, Erica Hill, and Rene Syler. From 2002 to 2010, she was a co-host of &quot;The Early Show&quot; on CBS, before leaving the daily position but remaining as a special contributing anchor of the program until its cancelation. Before CBS News, she was a reporter and weekend anchor at WCBS-TV in New York City.
Since 2000, she has also been the host of the American version of &quot;Big Brother&quot;. During the first season (2000), Chen was widely criticized for her heavily scripted, wooden delivery in her interaction with the studio audience and in the interviews on the live programs, earning her the nickname &quot;Chenbot.&quot; She has indicated in two interviews that she takes no personal offense at the term, adding that it may derive from her &quot;precise on-air style&quot; which comes from &quot;a desire to be objective.&quot; She again acknowledged the nickname while discussing mugs made in her likeness when she proudly proclaimed, &quot;I am the Chenbot!&quot; in a segment on &quot;The Early Show&quot;.

Chen was the moderator and co-host of the CBS Daytime talk show, &quot;The Talk&quot;, which premiered on October 18, 2010. The show featured Chen, the show creator Sara Gilbert, Sharon Osbourne, Leah Remini, Holly Robinson Peete and Marissa Jaret Winokur. Chen says that Remini and Robinson Peete complained about her to CBS and demanded that she be ousted from the show. Instead, it was the two actresses who were gone after the first season. Chen says she has since reconciled with them.

On September 18, 2018, Chen announced in a prerecorded tape that she would not be returning to &quot;The Talk&quot; because she needed &quot;to spend more time at home with [her] husband&quot;, after a number of sexual assault allegations surfaced against her husband Les Moonves.

In her 2023 audiobook &quot;But First, God: An Audio Memoir of Spiritual Discovery,&quot; she says she was &quot;&quot;&quot;collateral damage&quot; following the decision to oust Moonves at CBS. She says the day before Season 9 of &quot;The Talk&quot; premiered, she was told that “two of my co-hosts called the powers at CBS and said, ‘If Julie shows up to work tomorrow, we’re not coming in.’ So, I was basically told, ‘Please don’t come back to work anymore.&#x27;” Her &quot;Talk&quot; co-hosts at the time were Gilbert, Osbourne, Sheryl Underwood and Eve.

==Personal life==

Following her graduation from the University of Southern California as a broadcasting and English major, she became a news assistant for ABC News in Los Angeles, in September 1991. There, she met her future longtime boyfriend, television news editor Gary Donahue, though their relationship did not last. She began dating Les Moonves, president and chief executive officer of CBS Television, during his marriage to Nancy Wiesenfeld Moonves, and on April 22, 2003, a week after Les Moonves signed a five-year, multimillion-dollar contract with Viacom, his wife filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court citing irreconcilable differences. Divorce proceedings were delayed for almost two years because of financial settlement disagreements. On December 10, 2004, Moonves got a court to grant an early divorce, leaving spousal support and child support to be determined at a later date.

On December 23, 2004, Chen and Moonves were married in a private ceremony in Acapulco, Mexico. On September 24, 2009, Chen gave birth to their son, Charlie.

In September 2013, during the first week of Season 4 of &quot;The Talk&quot;, Chen revealed that she had undergone blepharoplasty early in her career after being pressured by her previous news director and a high-profile agent to look less Asian. Chen said that her decision &quot;divided&quot; her family, but stated she must &quot;live with every decision that I&#x27;ve made and it got me to where we are today. And I&#x27;m not going to look back.&quot;

Following a series of sexual misconduct allegations against her husband Les Moonves in 2018, she began using her married name beginning with the September 13, 2018, episode of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, signing off with, &quot;I&#x27;m Julie Chen Moonves, goodnight.&quot; This broke her established pattern where previously she would sign off simply as Julie Chen. The sign-off received a mixed response from viewers and fans on social media. CBS officially confirmed she would return to host the second season of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in a press release on November 27, 2018, using the name &quot;Julie Chen Moonves&quot;.

In her audiobook, &quot;But First, God: An Audio Memoir of Spiritual Discovery,&quot; released on September 19, 2023, she revealed that she had embraced Christianity in 2018 after never having attended a Sunday church service. She told &quot;Good Morning America&quot;: &quot;Julie Chen before she found God was self-absorbed, career-minded, vain, gossipy — fun to be with, but probably kind of a shallow person. Julie Chen Moonves, who now knows the Lord, is someone who wants to help others; who wants to look at everyone with a soft heart.&quot;

<text>The Kentucky River Authority is an agency of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Its major purpose is to operate and maintain a set of locks and dams along the course of the Kentucky River, which were originally built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. As of May 2018, Locks 5 through 14 are operated by the Authority, while Locks 1 through 4 are in the process of being deeded over to it. The Authority was established in 1986.

This system makes the Kentucky River navigable throughout its entire length. However, it is not available for efficient use by many of the modern barge tows, as the locks are relatively small and the channel is maintained to only a six-foot draft rather than the more typical nine-foot draft (the latter is the standard used on most major river systems in the U.S.). The Authority also works to prevent water pollution as much as is practicable along the Kentucky River Basin, in large measure because the stream is the source of the drinking water for approximately one-sixth of all Kentucky residents. The Authority&#x27;s responsibility for water quality was added to its mission in 1988 after a serious and prolonged drought brought issues of water quality and availability to the fore. In fact, the system is now operated more for the purpose of maintaining a secure supply of drinkable water for Lexington and other communities than it is to maximize navigation.

* bringing technology and industrial innovation to market more quickly
* encouraging cooperative research and development between business and the federal government by providing access to federal laboratories
* making it easier for businesses to obtain exclusive licenses to technology and inventions that result from cooperative research with the federal government

The Act made a direct impact on the development of new industrial and technology standards by requiring that all Federal agencies use cooperatively developed standards, particularly those developed by standards developing organizations.

<text>The Edinburgh Review is the title of four distinct intellectual and cultural magazines. The best known, longest-lasting, and most influential of the four was the third, which was published regularly from 1802 to 1929.

== &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, 1755–1756 ==

The first &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; was a short-lived venture initiated in 1755 by the Select Society, a group of Scottish men of letters concerned with the Enlightenment goals of social and intellectual improvement. According to the preface of the inaugural issue, the journal&#x27;s purpose was to &quot;demonstrate &#x27;the progressive state of learning in this country&#x27; and thereby to incite Scots &#x27;to a more eager pursuit of learning, to distinguish themselves, and to do honour to their country.&#x27;&quot; As a means to these ends, it would &quot;&quot;give a full account&quot; of all books published in Scotland within the compass of half a year; and ... take some notice of such books published elsewhere, as are most read in this country, or seem to have any title to draw the public attention.&quot; Among the most notable of the foreign publications it observed was Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot;, which Adam Smith reviewed in the journal&#x27;s second and final issue, published in March 1756. Its premature folding was due in large part to the partisan attacks the Moderate editors received from their opponents in the Church of Scotland, the Popular Party.

== &quot;Edinburgh Magazine and Review&quot;, 1773–1776 ==
A short-lived magazine with similar purposes, &quot;Edinburgh Magazine and Review&quot;, was published monthly between 1773 and 1776.

== &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, 1802–1929 ==

The third &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; became one of the most influential British magazines of the 19th century. It promoted Romanticism and Whig politics. (It was also, however, notoriously critical of some major Romantic poetry.)

Started on 10 October 1802 by Francis Jeffrey, Sydney Smith, Henry Brougham, and Francis Horner, it was published by Archibald Constable in quarterly issues until 1929. It began as a literary and political review. Under its first permanent editor, Francis Jeffrey (the first issue was edited by Sydney Smith), it was a strong supporter of the Whig party and liberal politics, and regularly called for political reform. Its main rival was the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; which supported the Tories. The magazine was also noted for its attacks on the Lake Poets, particularly William Wordsworth.

It was owned at one point by John Stewart, whose wife Louisa Hooper Stewart (1818–1918) was an early advocate of women&#x27;s suffrage, having been educated at the Quaker school of Newington Academy for Girls.

It took its Latin motto &quot;&quot; (&quot;the judge is condemned when the guilty is acquitted&quot;) from Publilius Syrus.

The magazine ceased publication in 1929.

=== Notable contributors to the third &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; ===
==&quot;New Edinburgh Review&quot; (1969–1984) and &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; (1984–2014)==

The Scottish cultural magazine &quot;New Edinburgh Review&quot; was founded in 1969. It was published by Edinburgh University Student Publications Board (EUSPB). The most famous issues of the &quot;New Edinburgh Review&quot; were the 1974 issues, supervised by C.K. Maisels, that discussed the philosophy of Antonio Gramsci. James Campbell edited fifteen issues of the magazine between 1978 and 1982. Other editors included David Cubitt, Julian Pollock, Brian Torode, Henry Drucker and Owen Dudley Edwards. Notable contributors included:

In 1984 (from the combined issue 67/68) the magazine adopted the title &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, along with the motto &quot;To gather all the rays of culture into one&quot;. From 2007 to 2012 it was part of the Eurozine network. Editors of &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; included Murdo Macdonald, Peter Kravitz, Robert Alan Jamieson, Gavin Wallace, Sophy Dale and Frank Kuppner. Notable contributors included:

<doc id="852522" wikidata="Q7314199" url="?curid=852522" title="Representation of a Lie superalgebra">
<text>In the mathematical field of representation theory, a representation of a Lie superalgebra is an action of Lie superalgebra &quot;L&quot; on a [[Representation of a Lie superalgebra|Z]]2-graded vector space &quot;V&quot;, such that if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are any two pure elements of &quot;L&quot; and &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are any two pure elements of &quot;V&quot;, then

:formula_1

:formula_2

:formula_3

:formula_4

Equivalently, a representation of &quot;L&quot; is a Z2-graded representation of the universal enveloping algebra of &quot;L&quot; which respects the third equation above.

==Unitary representation of a star Lie superalgebra==
A * Lie superalgebra is a complex Lie superalgebra equipped with an involutive antilinear map * such that * respects the grading and 

:[a,b]*=[b*,a*].

A unitary representation of such a Lie algebra is a Z2 graded Hilbert space which is a representation of a Lie superalgebra as above together with the requirement that self-adjoint elements of the Lie superalgebra are represented by Hermitian transformations.

This is a major concept in the study of supersymmetry together with representation of a Lie superalgebra on an algebra. Say A is an *-algebra representation of the Lie superalgebra (together with the additional requirement that * respects the grading and L[a]*=-(-1)LaL*[a*]) and H is the unitary rep and also, H is a unitary representation of A.

These three reps are all compatible if for pure elements a in A, |ψ&gt; in H and L in the Lie superalgebra,

:L[a|ψ&gt;)]=(L[a])|ψ&gt;+(-1)Laa(L[|ψ&gt;]).

Sometimes, the Lie superalgebra is embedded within A in the sense that there is a homomorphism from the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra to A. In that case, the equation above reduces to

:L[a]=La-(-1)LaaL.

This approach avoids working directly with a Lie supergroup, and hence avoids the use of auxiliary Grassmann numbers.

<text>John Andrew Davidson (August 19, 1852 – November 14, 1903) was a Manitoba politician. He was briefly the leader of Manitoba&#x27;s Conservative parliamentary caucus in 1894, and later served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Hugh John Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin.

==Biography==
Davidson was born in Thamesford, Canada West (now Ontario). He moved to Manitoba in 1871, and became a mill owner and general merchant, also serving on the Protestant school board.

Manitoba&#x27;s boundaries were expanded in 1881, and Davidson was elected to the provincial legislature in a by-election as the first member for Dauphin. A Liberal, he defeated his sole opponent, Peter St. Clair McGregor, 148 votes to 17.

Party affiliations were fluid in Manitoba in this period, and by the general election of 1883 Davidson was identifying himself as a Liberal-Conservative, and a supporter of Premier John Norquay. He was re-elected in Dauphin without opposition.

Following redistribution, Davidson campaigned in the Beautiful Plains constituency for the provincial election of 1886. The Liberals saw their support rise in this campaign, and Davidson (now a Conservative) lost to Liberal John Crawford by thirty votes. Crawford again defeated Davidson in the 1888 election, this time by twenty-four votes.

Provincial support for the Conservatives recovered slightly in the 1892 election, and Davidson defeated Crawford by sixteen votes in their third encounter. The opposition caucus to which he belonged initially chose William Alexander Macdonald as its leader. When Macdonald&#x27;s constituency election was overturned in 1893, Davidson was chosen in his place. He made his first speech as leader of the opposition in January 1894. Davidson was a moderate figure, whose interventions were respected by the province&#x27;s Liberal leadership.

He did not serve as opposition leader for long. His constituency victory was also overturned on April 17, 1894, and he was subsequently defeated by John Forsyth of the Patrons of Industry in a by-election. After his loss, the leadership of the opposition seems to have fallen to James Fisher, an Independent MLA. Davidson again lost to a Patrons of Industry candidate in the 1896 election.

Though the Conservatives returned to government in the 1899 election, Davidson was once again defeated in Beautiful Plains, losing to Liberal Robert Ennis by ninety votes. He was, nonetheless, appointed to cabinet by Premier Hugh John Macdonald in January 1900, serving as Provincial Treasurer, Minister of Agriculture, and Provincial Lands Commissioner. Ennis was persuaded to resign his seat the following month, and Crawford was returned to the legislature in a by-election.

Rodmond Roblin took the Agriculture portfolio for himself on becoming Premier in late 1900, but kept Davidson in his other two positions. Within a year, Davidson had eliminated the debt accumulated during the previous administration of Thomas Greenway.

Davidson was re-elected in the 1903 election, but died shortly after the election.

<text>Mark Edward Eaton (January 24, 1957 – May 28, 2021) was an American professional basketball player who spent his entire career (1982–1993) with the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Named an NBA All-Star in 1989, he was twice voted the NBA Defensive Player of the Year (1985, 1989) and was a five-time member of the NBA All-Defensive Team. The Eaton became one of the best defensive centers in NBA history. He led the league in blocks four times and holds the NBA single-season records for blocks (456) and blocked shots per game average (5.6), as well as career blocked shots per game (3.5). His 53 was retired by the Jazz.

Eaton was a reserve on his high school basketball team before graduating and working as an auto mechanic. He was discovered by an assistant coach at Cypress College, who persuaded Eaton to enroll at the community college and play basketball. Eaton transferred to play college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, but he was used sparingly. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 1982 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz as a long-term project. Eaton helped transform the Jazz from a last-place team into a perennial playoff team. When he retired from playing in 1994, he ranked second in the NBA in career blocks behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

==Early life==
Mark Edward Eaton was born on January 24, 1957, in Inglewood, California, and grew up in Southern California. His father, Bud, was a diesel mechanic instructor and stood tall, while Eaton&#x27;s mother, Delores, was . Despite his height, Eaton was more interested in playing water polo than basketball. As a senior at Westminster High School in Orange County, he stood and weighed but was uncoordinated, not very muscular, and relegated to a backup role on the basketball team. &quot;The coaches didn&#x27;t know how to teach me to play big, and I didn&#x27;t know how to play big,&quot; said Eaton.

==College career==
After graduating from high school in 1975, Eaton attended the Arizona Automotive Institute in Glendale and graduated as an automotive service technician. He returned to Orange County and worked as an auto mechanic, making $20,000 a year, when he was eventually discovered by Tom Lubin while repairing cars in Anaheim in April 1977. Lubin, a chemistry professor, was an assistant basketball coach at Cypress College. He had previously discovered Swen Nater, who did not play in high school but went on to a long, pro career. Lubin&#x27;s uncle, Frank, played on the 1936 U.S. Olympic basketball team. Lubin&#x27;s encouragement led Eaton to enroll at the community college in 1978 and try out for its basketball team.

After his freshman year at Cypress, Eaton was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the fifth round of the 1979 NBA draft with the 107th pick. He was eligible to be drafted because he was already four years removed from high school. However, he opted to return to college basketball. Eaton developed into a solid junior college player under head coach Don Johnson. He averaged 14.3 points per game in two seasons at Cypress and led the school to the California junior college title as a sophomore in 1980.

Eaton transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1980, but did not see much action in his two seasons with the Bruins. He played sparingly under head coach Larry Brown in 1980–81. The tallest players in the starting lineup were Darren Daye and Cliff Pruitt at , but Eaton was too slow for the team&#x27;s fast-paced offense. In Eaton&#x27;s senior year in 1981–82, new coach Larry Farmer vowed to give him a shot to start, but heralded freshman Stuart Gray got the nod instead. Eaton played just 41 total minutes that season, averaging 1.3 points and 2.0 rebounds in 11 games. Farmer did not play him at all towards the end of the season and did not allow him to travel with the team on their last road trip to Oregon and Oregon State. &quot;If I ever felt cheated, that was the time I felt the worst,&quot; recalled Eaton in 1985. &quot;I had worked so hard and it wasn&#x27;t like I was causing any problems.&quot;

Eaton was initially disappointed with his inability to play effectively in college. At a summer pickup game, Wilt Chamberlain saw his frustration, and encouraged Eaton to focus on protecting the basket, getting rebounds, and passing the ball to quicker guards, rather than trying to compete with smaller, quicker players in scoring. Eaton cited Chamberlain&#x27;s advice as the turning point in his basketball career.

==Professional career==
Because of his lack of playing time at UCLA, few NBA teams had an interest in Eaton after he finished his college career. He paid for two tryout camps, but only received an offer of $15,000 to play in Israel and another for $25,000 in Monte Carlo. However, the Utah Jazz, who finished in last place the prior season, saw him as a potentially dominant defender and selected him as a long-term project in the fourth round of the 1982 NBA draft with the 72nd overall pick. Utah coach Frank Layden quipped, &quot;Like [former University of Utah coach] Jack Gardner said, &#x27;You can&#x27;t teach height.&#x27;&quot; Also the team&#x27;s general manager, Layden discouraged Eaton from playing in Europe and signed him to a five-year contract, with the first season guaranteed at $45,000, for a total $570,000.

Eaton had worn No. 35 at UCLA, but the number was already taken on the Jazz by Darrell Griffith, prompting Eaton to choose the reversed No. 53. Entering the NBA, Eaton&#x27;s goal was to become a journeyman backup. He made an immediate impact as a rookie, starting 32 games and replacing Danny Schayes after the cash-strapped Jazz traded the center mid-season. Eaton finished the season with a then-franchise record 275 blocked shots while averaging only 19 minutes per game. His 3.4 blocks per game ranked third in the NBA, behind Atlanta&#x27;s Tree Rollins and San Diego&#x27;s Bill Walton.

The Jazz placed Eaton on a six-day-a-week program in the offseason. Layden said they treated him &quot;like a high school kid as far as basketball skills are concerned&quot;. Eaton continued to improve in his second season. In 82 games in 1983–84, he grabbed a team-leading 595 rebounds and blocked 351 shots (breaking his own franchise record). His 4.28 blocks per game led the NBA, well ahead of Rollins (who finished second with 3.60 blocks per game). During the season, he failed in his attempt to block the hook shot which gave Kareem Abdul-Jabbar his 31,421st point to break the NBA career scoring record held by Chamberlain. Eaton&#x27;s strong defense helped the Jazz improve from 30–52 in his rookie season to 45–37, winning their first Midwest Division title and making their first playoff appearance.

In Eaton&#x27;s third season in 1984–85, he blocked 456 shots, shattering the NBA record for most blocked shots in a single season set during the 1973–74 season by Elmore Smith, who had blocked 393 shots for the Los Angeles Lakers. Eaton averaged 5.56 blocks per game, an NBA single-season record that was more than double the league&#x27;s second-ranked shot-blocker that season (Houston&#x27;s Hakeem Olajuwon with 2.68 blocks per game). In addition, Eaton averaged 11.3 rebounds per game, ranking fifth in the league in that category. &quot;We had no idea that he would develop the way he has,&quot; said Layden during the season. Eaton was not on the All-Star ballot that year after being one of the final cuts. For his efforts, he was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team and was honored as the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. On April 26, 1985, Eaton had ten blocks in a 96–94 loss to the Rockets, becoming the first NBA player to record ten blocks in a playoff game (later tied by Olajuwon and Andrew Bynum).

Although he was not a significant offensive contributor, the Jazz relied heavily on Eaton for his shot-blocking, rebounding, and occasional &quot;tippy toe&quot; dunks. With the emergence of superstars Karl Malone and John Stockton, the Jazz became one of the best teams in the NBA. Eaton&#x27;s stifling defense was a major factor in Utah&#x27;s success. He continued to rank among NBA leaders in blocked shots, leading the league in 1986–87 and 1987–88. On November 17, 1987, Eaton set a career high with 25 rebounds in a 120–110 win over the Denver Nuggets. In 1988–89, he averaged 10.3 rebounds per game (seventh in the NBA) and 3.84 blocks per game (second behind Golden State&#x27;s Manute Bol). He was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year for the second time in his career and received his third selection to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. In addition, he was chosen to play in the 1989 NBA All-Star Game, joining teammates Malone and Stockton on the Western Conference team. It was the first time that the Jazz had three players in the All-Star Game.

In the 1989 playoffs, the second-seeded Jazz were upset in the first round 3–0 by the seventh-seeded Warriors. Golden State coach Don Nelson spread out his offense and avoided going inside against Eaton, and they played most of the series with a small lineup in which their tallest players on the court were Larry Smith or Ben McDonald or even Rod Higgins. Opponents were increasingly playing with smaller lineups, forcing Eaton to guard a quicker player who would draw him out to the perimeter and seek to drive past him. Utah coach Jerry Sloan countered by decreasing Eaton&#x27;s playing time and employing his own small lineup with backup center Mike Brown. In 1991–92, there was speculation that the more offensive-minded Brown would start the season at center, but Sloan stuck with Eaton. However, Eaton&#x27;s playing time dropped to 25 minutes per game from 32 minutes in 1990–91.

After missing just nine games in his first 10 seasons, Eaton was hindered by knee and back injuries late in his career. His rebounding and shot-blocking averages declined. During the 1992–93 season, knee surgery and back problems limited him to 64 games, averaging 17.3 minutes per game, both career lows. A degenerative back ailment forced him to drop out of training camp and miss the 1993–94 season; his contract expired at the end of the season. After therapy failed to correct the problem, he announced his retirement from basketball in September 1994.

==Legacy==
Eaton spent his entire 11-year NBA career with the Utah Jazz, helping transform the franchise from perennial 50-game losers to perennial 50-game winners. After going 30–52 in his first year, they made the playoffs in each of his 10 other seasons, beginning a run of 20 straight postseason appearances for the Jazz. In 875 games, he scored 5,216 points, grabbed 6,939 rebounds, and blocked 3,064 shots. At the time of his retirement, he ranked second all-time in league history in total blocked shots, behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s career total of 3,189. Blocks were not recorded as an official statistic until Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s fifth NBA season in 1973–74. Eaton is the NBA&#x27;s all-time leader in blocks per game, with a career average of 3.50. In a six-season span from his second season through his seventh (1983–1989), he led the league in blocks four times and was the runner-up twice while averaging 4.3 blocks per games over 488 contests. He never averaged more than 10 points per game in a season, which frustrated Utah fans after his scoring tapered off following a career high of 9.7 in 1984–85.

To honor his contributions to the team, the Utah Jazz retired Eaton&#x27;s No. 53 in 1996. In 2010, he was inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame along with former Jazz player Tom Chambers.

In 2014, Eaton had his jersey retired at Westminster High School and also at Cypress College, along with Swen Nater and head coach Don Johnson.

==Post-playing career==
After his retirement, Eaton worked for KJZZ-TV in Salt Lake City, providing color commentary and analysis for television broadcasts of Utah Jazz and University of Utah basketball games. He also hosted a radio talk show before Jazz games.

Eaton was a partner in Salt Lake City-area restaurants Tuscany and Franck&#x27;s.

He was a president/board member of the National Basketball Retired Players Association (NBRPA) from 1997 to 2007. He was also a founder and chairman of the Mark Eaton Standing Tall for Youth organization, which provided sports and outdoor activities for at-risk children in Utah. He was also a motivational speaker, and published the book &quot;The Four Commitments of a Winning Team&quot;.

In the 2013 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Jazz player Jeremy Evans jumped over a seated Eaton to dunk the ball. In later years, Eaton became a mentor to Jazz center Rudy Gobert, who joined him as the only other player in the franchise&#x27;s history to be named defensive player of the year.

==Personal life==
Eaton married his first wife, Marci, in 1980. A registered nurse who trained in Los Angeles, she worked as a nurse in Santa Monica to support him while he was attending college. The Eatons had two sons, Nicolas and Douglas.

While living in Utah in Jeremy Ranch in the 1980s, Eaton ordered a mountain bike suitable for his body frame, and he biked a number of the region&#x27;s first mountain bike trails. Around 2016, he began riding a custom French-built road bike for tall cyclists, which came outfitted with wheels.

On May 28, 2021, Eaton biked with a neighbor to lunch. A few hours after returning home, Eaton told his wife, Teri, that he was going for a short ride in the neighborhood. He died after a bicycle accident about a block from his home in Park City, Utah. He was found unresponsive by a passerby and was pronounced dead at the hospital. He was 64 years old. The sheriff said that there were no witnesses to the incident nor any indication that a vehicle was involved.

<text>Denis Coderre (born July 25, 1963) is a Canadian politician from Quebec. Coderre was the member of Parliament for the riding of Bourassa from 1997 until 2013, and was the Immigration minister from 2002 to 2003 and became the mayor of Montreal in 2013, but lost in 2017 to Valérie Plante. In the 2021 Montreal municipal election, he was defeated once again by Plante.

== Background ==
Born in Joliette, Quebec, Coderre is the son of Elphege Coderre, a carpenter, and Lucie Baillargeon. The family moved to Montréal-Nord in 1973, where Coderre attended École Secondaire Henri-Bourassa and Cégep Marie-Victorin. He has a BA in political science from the Université de Montréal and a Master in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Ottawa.

== Federal politics ==
=== Unsuccessful Liberal candidate ===
Coderre ran unsuccessfully three times prior to being elected: first, in the 1988 election in the riding of Joliette, losing to the Progressive Conservative candidate, Gaby Larrivée; second, in a 1990 by-election in the riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie, losing to Gilles Duceppe; and third, in the 1993 elections in the riding of Bourassa, defeated by the Bloc Québécois candidate, Osvaldo Núñez.

=== Member of Parliament ===
Coderre was elected as a member of Parliament in 1997 representing the riding of Bourassa, located in Montreal, and was re-elected in the 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011 federal elections. In August 1999 he was appointed secretary of state for amateur sport.

==== Cabinet minister ====
In January 2002, he was appointed immigration minister.

On December 12, 2003, prime minister Paul Martin advised governor general Adrienne Clarkson to appoint Coderre to the Cabinet as president of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada where he was responsible for a number of files, such as the creation of the new Public Service Human Resources Management Agency. He was also the federal interlocutor for Métis and non-status Indians, the minister responsible for &quot;La Francophonie&quot; and the minister responsible for the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution. Coderre was not re-appointed to Cabinet following the 2004 general election, despite being re-elected in his riding.

As minister of immigration, Coderre supervised the application of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which came into effect on June 28, 2002. As secretary of state for amateur sport, Coderre successfully negotiated a number of national and international agreements and helped to establish the World Anti-Doping Agency in Montreal.

Adil Charkaoui

As minister of immigration, Coderre was responsible for the detention of Adil Charkaoui, a Moroccan immigrant with a checkered travel history, on a security certificate. Restrictions on Charkaoui&#x27;s conditional release were gradually lifted, and were cancelled in September 2009, on his final release order by Federal Court judge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer.

==== Sponsorship scandal ====
During the events of the sponsorship scandal, Coderre was accused of frequent confidential conversations with Pierre Tremblay, head of the Communications Coordination Services Branch of Public Works. Coderre has denied these allegations. His previous position as vice-president of public affairs for Le Groupe Polygone Éditeurs Inc. was judged to be a key connecting factor.
 Close links to Claude Boulay of Groupe Everest, another actor in the sponsorship scandal, were also made during the Gomery Inquiry.

==== Shane Doan incident ====
During the 2006 election, Coderre accused National Hockey League player Shane Doan of uttering ethnic slurs directed against French-speaking referees at a game in Montreal. Coderre wrote a letter to the Canadian Olympic Committee asking them to keep Doan off Canada&#x27;s 2006 hockey team competing at the Olympics in Turin, Italy. The Globe and Mail columnist Eric Duhatschek noted that &quot;the NHL is tough on ethnic slurs ... if Mr. Coderre has any proof he should produce it. Otherwise he should just shut up.&quot; Hockey commentator John Davidson accused Coderre of &quot;grandstanding&quot; and criticized his accusation, saying that &quot;a person shouldn&#x27;t go stand on a platform and yell and scream about it when he doesn&#x27;t even know the facts.&quot;

Doan was given a gross misconduct penalty for verbal abuse of the officials at the end of the December 13, 2005 game between his team, the Phoenix Coyotes, and the Montreal Canadiens. Referees and linesmen for the game were all Francophones from Quebec. Although one of the linesmen, Michel Cormier, filed a report against the player, Doan was cleared by NHL&#x27;s chief disciplinarian and executive vice-president Colin Campbell, who concluded that the allegations were baseless. Doan himself has denied that he ever made the ethnic slur.

In January 2006, Doan sued Coderre for character defamation seeking $250,000 in damages with Doan promising to donate all damages awarded to charities to benefit Canadians. In April 2007, Coderre counter-sued Doan for defamation seeking $45,000 in damages.

==== Opposition MP ====
Coderre won re-election to the House of Commons in 2006, but the Liberals lost the campaign and became the official opposition. Coderre was the Liberal defence critic. In 2007, Coderre made allegations against the previous chief of Defence Staff general Rick Hillier of being a &quot;prop&quot;. Hillier, in return, accused Coderre of being more concerned with party image than in protecting Canadian Forces members. In October 2007, Coderre made a self-planned visit to Afghanistan to visit the war-torn country and the Canadian Forces in the Kandahar region. He criticized the Harper government who did not invite him on an official tour of the country that was made by ministers Bev Oda and Maxime Bernier a few days before him. Consequently, Coderre, as Liberal defence critic, had to travel by himself at his own expense. He then mentioned that the mission in Afghanistan must change in 2009. The government had accused him of staging a stunt while he fired back that the Conservatives overestimated the success of the mission.

===== Quebec lieutenant =====
On January 22, 2009, Coderre became the Quebec lieutenant of Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff. He had been offered the same assignment by former leader Stéphane Dion, but had declined the offer.

On September 28, 2009, Coderre resigned as Quebec lieutenant because of a disagreement with Ignatieff. Coderre had been tasked with picking &#x27;star candidates&#x27; for the next election, attempting to replace Montreal-area MPs Stéphane Dion, Lise Zarac, and Bernard Patry, as well as Laval MP Raymonde Folco, at Ignatieff&#x27;s request. Coderre had chosen Nathalie Le Prohon to run in Outremont, formerly a Liberal safe seat held by the NDP&#x27;s Thomas Mulcair. However, Martin Cauchon was seeking a return to politics and wanted to run in Outremont, a riding he had held for 11 years prior to 2004 when then-Liberal leader Paul Martin would not guarantee Cauchon&#x27;s nomination. Cauchon had served as Jean Chrétien&#x27;s minister of justice and Quebec lieutenant. Cauchon preferred to seek help from Alfred Apps from Toronto instead of talking to Coderre and his team. Cauchon and Coderre had previously been close when both were part of Chrétien&#x27;s cabinet, but some suggest that Coderre now saw Cauchon as a potential rival for influence over the Quebec wing of the Liberals, and perhaps in a future leadership convention. Ignatieff initially sided with Coderre, then reversed his decision and allowed Cauchon to run in Outremont.

In Coderre&#x27;s first press conference after resigning as Quebec lieutenant, he criticized Ignatieff&#x27;s aides, all of whom were from Toronto. Coderre also skipped votes in the House of Commons in protest. Ignatieff later warned that Coderre would face expulsion from caucus if he did &quot;any more damage to the party.&quot;

In 2012, Coderre confirmed that he would not run for the leadership of the federal Liberal Party.

== Mayoralty ==
=== 2013 election ===
Coderre resigned on June 2, 2013 to run for mayor of Montreal in the 2013 Montreal municipal election. He formed the Montreal municipal party Équipe Denis Coderre pour Montréal (alternatively Équipe Denis Coderre) though he had no previous provincial or municipal experience. Coderre was elected mayor of Montreal on November 3, 2013.

=== Spending of $410 million for Montréal&#x27;s 375th anniversary in 2017 ===
Coderre&#x27;s municipal government contributed $410 million for events and projects for Montreal&#x27;s 375th anniversary, which took place in 2017. The figure of 410 million means $241 per person in Montreal (population 1.7 million). The total spending for the festivities exceeded $1 billion. The rest came from Quebec, Ottawa and private sources. For Montreal&#x27;s contribution, the main achievements that remain include several sculptures in various parts of Montreal and some other beautification projects. In addition, the Société des célébrations du 375e anniversaire de Montréal, to which Montreal was a major contributor, paid $9.5 million out of the total price of $40 million for the controversial light project of the Jacques Cartier Bridge. Some have found that the costs of the celebrations have not been worth the benefits.

=== 2017 election ===
Coderre ran for re-election in the 2017 Montreal municipal election on November 5, 2017. In a surprise, Coderre lost the mayoral race to Valérie Plante, making her the first female elected Mayor for the city of Montréal. After the election loss, he announced that he would be retiring from politics.

=== Political positions ===
==== Lawsuit by Hamza Chaoui ====
On January 31, 2015, the Coderre administration denied a request to open an Islamic community centre in the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood of Montreal because its imam Hamza Chaoui, had allegedly preached that Canadians ought to change their legal system to sharia. Chaoui filed a lawsuit on July 9 for defamation against Coderre and the city of Montreal. Chaoui characterised Coderre&#x27;s remarks as an attack on his dignity, honour and reputation. Réal Ménard, the borough mayor of Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, supported Coderre&#x27;s position.

==== Coderre jackhammer vs. mailbox stunt ====
In August 2015, Coderre took a jackhammer to a Canada Post community mailbox foundation in l&#x27;Anse-à-l&#x27;Orme Nature Park. He was dismissive of concerns that his action was illegal. The Province of Quebec&#x27;s Crown prosecutors office confirmed that Coderre would not face charges for the media stunt.

==== Environmental issues ====
From October 18, 2015 until October 25, 2015, Coderre authorized the dumping for 8 billion litres of untreated sewage into the Saint Lawrence River to facilitate repairs to Montreal&#x27;s sewer system. The incident was widely criticized by Environment and Climate Change Canada, Infrastructure Canada, and a petition of over 55,000 signatures.

On January 21, 2016, Coderre, along with other officials of the Montreal Metropolitan Community (Communauté Métropolitaine de Montréal), formally opposed the Energy East pipeline project based on environmental concerns. His position was denounced by Conservative Party of Canada interim leader Rona Ambrose, Saskatchewan Party leader Brad Wall and Alberta Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean.

==== Pit bull ban ====
On September 27, 2016, Montreal passed a citywide pit bull ban. Coderre was an advocate for the bylaw, stating that &quot;my duty as mayor of Montreal is making sure I am working for all Montrealers, and I am there to make sure they feel safe and that they are safe.&quot; The bylaw creates a citywide ban on new pit bull-type dogs from being owned and added restrictions on those currently in the city. The bylaw also places new restrictions on all dogs and cats within the city and its 19 boroughs. Animal protection groups such as the Montreal SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) stated that if the new bylaw passed they would take legal action against the city.

On October 3, 2016, a Quebec judge temporarily suspended the pit bull ban part of the bylaw. Two days later the judge decided to extend the suspension on the grounds that the bylaw was too vague and imprecise, claiming that &quot;this court has the impression that certain articles of the bylaw were written in haste.&quot; An appeal court overturned the decision and Coderre&#x27;s pit bull ban was in effect in Montreal from December 1, 2016 to December 20, 2017, when the administration of new mayor Valérie Plante repealed it in favor of a new animal by-law that didn&#x27;t target specific breeds. Opposition to Coderre&#x27;s pit bull ban was an electoral issue during the 2017 Montreal municipal election.

==Post-mayoral career==
Coderre was an administrator of Eurostar from 2018 to 2021, as well as a special advisor for the FIA since 2019. 

After much speculation, Coderre had announced his intention to run for mayor of Montreal in the 2021 Montreal municipal election. On April 7, 2021 he became leader of the municipal party Ensemble Montréal, which was formerly called Équipe Denis Coderre. On November 7, 2021, he was defeated once again by Valérie Plante. After the election loss, he announced once again that he would be retiring from politics.

In April 2023, Coderre suffered a mild stroke.

Coderre was a candidate in the 2025 Quebec Liberal Party leadership election. He was disqualified by the party&#x27;s Electoral Committee on February 7, 2025. While no reason for the move was issued publicly, the action followed reports that Coderre owed more than $130,000 in provincial taxes and more than $266,000 to the Canada Revenue Agency.

<doc id="852563" wikidata="Q1503113" url="?curid=852563" title="Late Latin">
<text>Late Latin is the scholarly name for the form of Literary Latin of late antiquity. English dictionary definitions of Late Latin date this period from the 3rd to 6th centuries AD, and continuing into the 7th century in the Iberian Peninsula. This somewhat ambiguously defined version of Latin was used between the eras of Classical Latin and Medieval Latin. Scholars do not agree exactly when Classical Latin should end or Medieval Latin should begin.

Being a written language, Late Latin is not the same as Vulgar Latin, or more specifically, the spoken Latin of the post Imperial period. The latter served as ancestor of the Romance languages. Although Late Latin reflects an upsurge of the use of Vulgar Latin vocabulary and constructs, it remains largely classical in its overall features, depending on the author who uses it. Some Late Latin writings are more literary and classical, but others are more inclined to the vernacular. As such it is an important source of information about changes in the spoken language, while not being a simple replication of the state of the oral language at the time. Also, Late Latin is not identical to Christian patristic Latin, used in the theological writings of the early Christian fathers. While Christian writings used a subset of Late Latin, pagans, such as Ammianus Marcellinus or Macrobius, also wrote extensively in Late Latin, especially in the early part of the period.

Late Latin formed when large numbers of non-Latin-speaking peoples on the borders of the empire were being subsumed and assimilated, and the rise of Christianity was introducing a heightened divisiveness in Roman society, creating a greater need for a standard language for communicating between different socioeconomic registers and widely separated regions of the sprawling empire. A new and more universal speech evolved from the main elements: Classical Latin, Christian Latin, which featured (ordinary speech) in which the people were to be addressed, and all the various dialects of Vulgar Latin.

The linguist Antoine Meillet wrote: &quot;Without the exterior appearance of the language being much modified, Latin became in the course of the imperial epoch a new language... Serving as some sort of lingua franca to a large empire, Latin tended to become simpler, to keep above all what it had of the ordinary.&quot;

==Philological constructs==
===Late and post-classical Latin===
The origin of the term &#x27;Late Latin&#x27; remains obscure. A notice in &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; of the publication of Andrews&#x27; &quot;Freund&#x27;s Lexicon of the Latin Language&quot; in 1850 mentions that the dictionary divides Latin into ante-classic, quite classic, Ciceronian, Augustan, post-Augustan and post-classic or late Latin, which indicates the term already was in professional use by English classicists in the early 19th century. Instances of English vernacular use of the term may also be found from the 18th century. The term Late Antiquity meaning post-classical and pre-medieval had currency in English well before then.

===Imperial Latin===
Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel&#x27;s first edition (1870) of &quot;History of Roman Literature&quot; defined an early period, the Golden Age, the Silver Age and then goes on to define other ages first by dynasty and then by century (see under Classical Latin). In subsequent editions he subsumed all periods under three headings: the First Period (Old Latin), the Second Period (the Golden Age) and the Third Period, &quot;the Imperial Age&quot;, subdivided into the Silver Age, the 2nd century, and the 3rd–6th centuries together, which was a recognition of Late Latin, as he sometimes refers to the writings of those times as &quot;late&quot;. Imperial Latin went on into English literature; Fowler&#x27;s &quot;History of Roman Literature&quot; mentions it in 1903.

The beginning and end of Imperial Latin is not well defined. Politically, the excluded Augustan Period is the paradigm of imperiality, but the style cannot be grouped with either the Silver Age or with Late Latin. In 6th-century Italy, the Western Roman Empire no longer existed and the rule of Gothic kings prevailed. Subsequently, the term Imperial Latin was dropped by historians of Latin literature, although it may be seen in marginal works. The Silver Age was extended a century, and the four centuries following made use of Late Latin.

===Christian, patristic, Vulgate and ancient Latin===
===Low Latin===

Low Latin is a vague and often pejorative term that might refer to any post-classical Latin from Late Latin through Renaissance Latin, depending on the author. Its origins are obscure, but the Latin expression &quot;media et infima Latinitas&quot; sprang into public notice in 1678 in the title of a &quot;Glossary&quot; (by today&#x27;s standards a dictionary) by Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange. The multivolume set had many editions and expansions by other authors subsequently. The title varies somewhat; most commonly used was &quot;Glossarium Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis&quot;. It has been translated by expressions of widely different meanings. The uncertainty is understanding what &quot;media&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;infima&quot;, &quot;low&quot;, mean in this context.

The term &quot;media&quot; is securely connected to Medieval Latin by du Cange&#x27;s own terminology expounded in the &quot;Praefatio&quot;, such as &quot;scriptores mediae aetatis&quot;, &quot;writers of the middle age&quot;. Du Cange&#x27;s &quot;Glossary&quot; takes words from authors ranging from the Christian period (Late Latin) to the Renaissance, dipping into the classical period if a word originated there. Either &quot;media et infima Latinitas&quot; refers to one age, which must be the middle age covering the entire post-classical range, or it refers to two consecutive periods, &quot;infima Latinitas&quot; and &quot;media Latinitas&quot;. Both interpretations have their adherents.
In the former case, the &quot;infimae&quot; appears extraneous; it recognizes the &quot;corruptio&quot; of the &quot;corrupta Latinitas&quot; which du Cange said his &quot;Glossary&quot; covered. The two-period case postulates a second unity of style, &quot;infima Latinitas&quot;, translated into English as &quot;Low Latin&quot; (which in the one-period case would be identical to &quot;media Latinitas&quot;). Du Cange in the glossarial part of his &quot;Glossary&quot; identifies some words as being used by &quot;purioris Latinitatis scriptores&quot;, such as Cicero (of the Golden Age). He has already said in the Preface that he rejects the ages scheme used by some: Golden Age, Silver Age, Brass Age, Iron Age. A second category are the &quot;inferioris Latinitatis scriptores&quot;, such as Apuleius (Silver Age). The third and main category are the &quot;infimae Latinitatis scriptores&quot;, who must be post-classical; that is, Late Latin, unless they are also medieval. His failure to state which authors are low leaves the issue unresolved.

He does, however, give some idea of the source of his &quot;infima&quot;, which is a classical word, &quot;lowest&quot;, of which the comparative degree is &quot;inferior&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;. In the preface, he opposes the style of the &quot;scriptores aevi inferioris&quot; (Silver Age) to the &quot;elegantes sermones&quot;, &quot;elegant speech&quot;, the high and low styles of &quot;Latinitas&quot; defined by the classical authors. Apparently, du Cange was basing his low style on &quot;sermo humilis&quot;, the simplified speech devised by Late Latin Christian writers to address the ordinary people. &quot;Humilis&quot; (humble, humility) means &quot;low&quot;, &quot;of the ground&quot;. The Christian writers were not interested in the elegant speech of the best or classical Latin, which belonged to their aristocratic pagan opponents. Instead, they preferred a humbler style lower in correctness, so that they might better deliver the gospel to the &quot;vulgus&quot; or &quot;common people&quot;.

Low Latin in this view is the Latin of the two periods in which it has the least degree of purity, or is most corrupt. By corrupt, du Cange only meant that the language had resorted to nonclassical vocabulary and constructs from various sources, but his choice of words was unfortunate. It allowed the &quot;corruption&quot; to extend to other aspects of society, providing fuel for the fires of religious (Catholic vs. Protestant) and class (conservative vs. revolutionary) conflict. Low Latin passed from the heirs of the Italian renaissance to the new philologists of the northern and Germanic climes, where it became a different concept.

In Britain, Gildas&#x27; view that Britain fell to the Anglo-Saxons because it was morally slack was already well known to the scholarly world. The northern Protestants now worked a role reversal; if the language was &quot;corrupt&quot;, it must be symptomatic of a corrupt society, which indubitably led to a &quot;decline and fall&quot;, as Edward Gibbon put it, of imperial society. Writers taking this line relied heavily on the scandalous behavior of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the bad emperors reported by Tacitus and other writers and later by the secret history of Procopius, who hated his royal employers to such a degree that he could not contain himself about their real methods and way of life any longer. They, however, spoke elegant Latin. The Protestants changed the scenario to fit their ideology that the church needed to be purified of corruption. For example, Baron Bielfeld, a Prussian officer and comparative Latinist, characterised the low in Low Latin, which he saw as medieval Latin, as follows:
As &#x27;Low Latin&#x27; tends to be muddled with Vulgar Latin, Late Latin, and Medieval Latin, and has unfortunate extensions of meaning into the sphere of socio-economics, it has gone out of use by the mainstream philologists of Latin literature. A few writers on the periphery still mention it, influenced by the dictionaries and classic writings of former times.

As Teuffel&#x27;s scheme of the Golden Age and the Silver Age is the generally accepted one, the canonical list of authors should begin just after the end of the Silver Age, regardless of what 3rd century event is cited as the beginning; otherwise there are gaps. Teuffel gave the end of the Silver Age as the death of Hadrian at 138 CE. His classification of styles left a century between that event and his final period, the 3rd–6th centuries CE, which was in other systems being considered Late Antiquity.

Starting with Charles Thomas Crutwell&#x27;s &quot;A History of Roman Literature from the Earliest Period to the Death of Marcus Aurelius&quot;, which first came out in 1877, English literary historians have included the spare century in Silver Latin. Accordingly, the latter ends with the death of the last of the five good emperors in 180 CE. Other authors use other events, such as the end of the Nervan–Antonine dynasty in 192 CE or later events. A good round date of gives a canonical list of nearly no overlap.

The transition between Late Latin and Medieval Latin is by no means as easy to assess. Taking that &quot;media et infima Latinitas&quot; was one style, Mantello in a recent handbook asserts of &quot;the Latin used in the middle ages&quot; that it is &quot;here interpreted broadly to include late antiquity and therefore to extend from c. AD 200 to 1500.&quot; Although recognizing &quot;late antiquity&quot; he does not recognize Late Latin. It did not exist and Medieval Latin began directly from 200 CE. In this view all differences from Classical Latin are bundled as though they evolved through a single continuous style.

Of the two-style interpretations the Late Latin period of Erich Auerbach and others is one of the shortest: &quot;In the first half of the 6th century, which witnessed the beginning and end of Ostrogoth rule in Italy, Latin literature becomes medieval. Boethius was the last &#x27;ancient&#x27; author and the role of Rome as the center of the ancient world, as &quot;communis patria&quot;, was at an end.&quot; In essence, the lingua franca of classical vestiges was doomed when Italy was overrun by the Goths, but its momentum carried it one lifetime further, ending with the death of Boethius in 524 CE.

Not everyone agrees that the lingua franca came to an end with the fall of Rome, but argue that it continued and became the language of the reinstituted Carolingian Empire (predecessor of the Holy Roman Empire) under Charlemagne. Toward the end of his reign his administration conducted some language reforms. The first recognition that Late Latin could not be understood by the masses and therefore was not a lingua franca was the decrees of 813 CE by synods at Mainz, Rheims Tours that from then on preaching was to be done in a language more understandable to the people, which was stated by Tours Canon 17 as &quot;rustica Romana lingua&quot;, identified as Romance, the descendant of Vulgar Latin. Late Latin as defined by Meillet was at an end; however, Pucci&#x27;s Harrington&#x27;s &quot;Mediaeval Latin&quot; sets the end of Late Latin when Romance began to be written, &quot;Latin retired to the cloister&quot; and &quot;&quot;Romanitas&quot; lived on only in the fiction of the Holy Roman Empire.&quot; The final date given by those authors is 900 CE.

<doc id="852564" wikidata="Q508942" url="?curid=852564" title="List of monarchs of Mercia">
<text>The Kingdom of Mercia was a state in the English Midlands from the 6th century to the 10th century. For some two hundred years from the mid-7th century onwards it was the dominant member of the Heptarchy and consequently the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. During this period its rulers became the first English monarchs to assume such wide-ranging titles as &quot;King of Britain&quot; and &quot;King of the English&quot;.

Spellings varied widely in this period, even within a single document, and a number of variants exist for the names given below. For example, the sound &quot;th&quot; was usually represented with the Old English letters ð or þ.

For the Continental predecessors of the Mercians in Angeln, see List of kings of the Angles. For their successors see List of English monarchs.

==Kings of the Mercians==

The traditional rulers of Mercia were known as the Iclingas, descendants of the kings of the Angles. When the Iclingas became extinct in the male line, a number of other families, labelled B, C and W by historians, competed for the throne.



All the following are kings, unless specified. Those in &quot;italics&quot; are probably legendary, are of dubious authenticity, or may not have reigned.

===Titular kings following Mercia&#x27;s annexation===

==Ealdormen and Earls of the Mercians==
The chief magnate of Mercia as an English province held the title of ealdorman until 1023/32, and earl thereafter. Both offices were royal appointments, but the latter in effect became hereditary.


===Earls of March===

The title Earl of March (etymologically identical to &#x27;Earl of Mercia&#x27;) was created in the western Midlands for Roger Mortimer in 1328. It has fallen extinct, and been recreated, three times since then, and exists today as a subsidiary title of the Duke of Richmond and Lennox.

<text>Ronald Earle Glass (July 10, 1945 – November 25, 2016) was an American actor. He was known for his roles as literary Det. Ron Harris in the television sitcom &quot;Barney Miller&quot; (1975–1982), and as the spiritual shepherd, Shepherd Book, in the science fiction series &quot;Firefly&quot; (2002) and its sequel film &quot;Serenity&quot; (2005).

==Early life==
Glass was born in Evansville, Indiana, the son of Lethia and Crump Glass.

After graduating from St. Francis Seminary in 1964, Glass attended the University of Evansville, where he received a Bachelor of Arts, double majoring in drama and literature. Years later, the university awarded him its Medal of Honor. Glass said in 2007 he knew while he was in college that he wanted to act. With a teacher&#x27;s encouragement, he performed in a play and went on to an acting career.

==Career==
Glass made his stage debut at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, before moving to Hollywood. His earliest TV appearances include episodes of &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; in 1972, an episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; in 1973, an episode of &quot;Maude&quot; in 1973, an episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot; in 1973, an episode of &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, and episodes of &quot;Good Times&quot; in 1974. In 1975, he landed the role of Det. Ron Harris in &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, which ran until 1982.

The following season, Glass co-starred with Demond Wilson on television in a remake of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, called &quot;The New Odd Couple&quot;. On December 13, 1985, he played a soul-collecting devil opposite Sherman Hemsley&#x27;s mathematics professor in an episode of the revived &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series. In 1992, he co-starred in the sitcom &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot;, a kind of &quot;black &quot;WKRP&quot;, playing &quot;the fifth Top&quot; opposite Roger Kabler.

In 1996, Glass was cast as uptight history teacher Roland Felcher in the NBC sitcom &quot;Mr. Rhodes&quot; opposite Tom Rhodes. In 1999, he appeared in two episodes of the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; as Russell, Ross Geller&#x27;s lawyer. After that, Glass appeared in dozens of television series, including sitcoms such as &quot;Family Matters&quot; and the series &quot;Teen Angel&quot;, where he played God&#x27;s cousin Rod. He had a guest appearance in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Nightingale&quot;. He was a series regular in the science fiction series &quot;Firefly&quot; (2002) and the sequel film &quot;Serenity&quot; (2005), in which he played Derrial Book, a Christian &quot;Shepherd&quot; with a mysterious past. Glass provided the voice of Randy Carmichael for the Nickelodeon series &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; and &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and the character Garth in the video game &quot;Fable II&quot;. In 2008 he appeared in the film &quot;Lakeview Terrace&quot; alongside Samuel L. Jackson and starred in the 2010 version of &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; as Duncan.

==Personal life and death==
Glass never married, and though raised Catholic became a devout Buddhist, and a member of Soka Gakkai International. He died of respiratory failure on November 25, 2016, at the age of 71. He is interred at the Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.

<doc id="852567" wikidata="Q12248651" url="?curid=852567" title="Triarchic theory of intelligence">
<text>The Triarchic Theory of Intelligence or Three Forms of Intelligence, formulated by psychologist Robert Sternberg, aims to go against the psychometric approach to intelligence and take a more cognitive approach, which leaves it to the category of the cognitive-contextual theories. The three meta components are also called triarchic components.

Sternberg&#x27;s definition of human intelligence is &quot;(a) mental activity directed toward purposive adaptation to, selection and shaping of, real-world environments relevant to one&#x27;s life&quot;. Thus, Sternberg viewed intelligence as how well an individual deals with environmental changes throughout their lifespan. Sternberg&#x27;s theory comprises three parts: componential, experiential and practical.

Sternberg&#x27;s theory has since been expanded and advanced in the book &quot;Experiential Intelligence&quot; by Soren Kaplan.

==Different components of information processing==

Sternberg associated the workings of the mind with a series of components. These components he labeled the metacomponents, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components.

The &quot;metacomponents&quot; are executive processes used in problem solving and decision making that involve the majority of managing our mind. They tell the mind how to act. Metacomponents are also sometimes referred to as a homunculus. A homunculus is a fictitious or metaphorical &quot;person&quot; inside our head that controls our actions, and which is often seen to invite an infinite regress of homunculi controlling each other.

Sternberg&#x27;s next set of components, &quot;performance components&quot;, are the processes that actually carry out the actions the metacomponents dictate. These are the basic processes that allow us to do tasks, such as perceiving problems in our long-term memory, perceiving relations between objects, and applying relations to another set of terms.

The last set of components, &quot;knowledge-acquisition components&quot;, are used in obtaining new information. These components complete tasks that involve selectively choosing relevant information from a mix of information, some of it relevant and some of it irrelevant. These components can also be used to selectively combine the various pieces of information they have gathered. Gifted individuals are proficient in using these components because they are able to learn new information at a greater rate.

Whereas Sternberg explains that the basic information processing components underlying the three parts of his triarchic theory are the same, different contexts and different tasks require different kinds of intelligence.

===Componential – analytical subtheory===
This form of intelligence focuses on academic proficiency.

Sternberg associated the componential subtheory with analytical giftedness. This is one of three types of giftedness that Sternberg recognizes. Analytical giftedness is influential in being able to take apart problems and being able to see solutions not often seen. Unfortunately, individuals with only this type are not as adept at creating unique ideas of their own. This form of giftedness is the type that is tested most often.

===Experiential – creative subtheory===
This form of intelligence focuses on &quot;capacity to be intellectually flexible and innovative.

The experiential subtheory is the second stage of the triarchic theory. This stage deals mainly with how well a task is performed with regard to how familiar it is. Sternberg splits the role of experience into two parts: novelty and automation.

A &quot;novel&quot; situation is one that has not been experienced before. People that are adept at managing a novel situation can take the task and find new ways of solving it that the majority of people would not notice.

A process that has been &quot;automated&quot; has been performed multiple times and can now be done with little or no extra thought. Once a process is automatized, it can be run in parallel with the same or other processes. The problem with novelty and automation is that being skilled in one component does not ensure that you are skilled in the other.

The experiential subtheory also correlates with another one of Sternberg&#x27;s proposed types of giftedness. Synthetic giftedness is seen in creativity, intuition, and a study of the arts. People with synthetic giftedness are not often seen with the highest IQs because there are not currently any tests that can sufficiently measure these attributes, but synthetic giftedness is especially useful in creating new ideas to create and solve new problems. Sternberg also associated another one of his students, &quot;Barbara&quot;, to the synthetic giftedness. Barbara did not perform as well as Alice on the tests taken to get into school, but was recommended to Yale University based on her exceptional creative and intuitive skills. Barbara was later very valuable in creating new ideas for research.

===Practical - contextual subtheory===
Sternberg&#x27;s third subtheory of intelligence, called practical or contextual, &quot;deals with the mental activity involved in attaining fit to &quot;. Through the three processes of adaptation, shaping, and selection, individuals create an ideal fit between themselves and their environment. This type of intelligence is often referred to as &quot;street smarts.&quot;

&quot;Adaptation&quot; occurs when one makes a change within oneself in order to better adjust to one&#x27;s surroundings. For example, when the weather changes and temperatures drop, people adapt by wearing extra layers of clothing to remain warm.

&quot;Shaping&quot; occurs when one changes their environment to better suit one&#x27;s needs. A teacher may invoke the new rule of raising hands to speak to ensure that the lesson is taught with least possible disruption.

The process of &quot;selection&quot; is undertaken when a completely new alternate environment is found to replace the previous, unsatisfying environment to meet the individual&#x27;s goals. For instance, immigrants leave their lives in their homeland countries where they endure economical and social hardships and go to other countries in search of a better and less strained life.

The effectiveness with which an individual fits to his or her environment and contends with daily situations reflects degree of intelligence. Sternberg&#x27;s third type of giftedness, called practical giftedness, involves the ability to apply synthetic and analytic skills to everyday situations. Practically gifted people are superb in their ability to succeed in any setting. An example of this type of giftedness is &quot;Celia&quot;. Celia did not have outstanding analytical or synthetic abilities, but she &quot;was highly successful in figuring out what she needed to do in order to succeed in an academic environment. She knew what kind of research was valued, how to get articles into journals, how to impress people at job interviews, and the like&quot;. Celia&#x27;s contextual intelligence allowed her to use these skills to her best advantage. 
Sternberg also acknowledges that an individual is not restricted to having excellence in only one of these three intelligences. Many people may possess an integration of all three and have high levels of all three intelligences.

Practical intelligence is also a topic covered by Malcolm Gladwell in his book &quot;&quot;.

==Criticism==
Psychologist Linda Gottfredson criticises the unempirical nature of triarchic theory. Further, she argues it is absurd to assert that traditional intelligence tests are not measuring practical intelligence, given that they show a moderate correlation with income, especially at middle age when individuals have had a chance to reach their maximum career potential, and an even higher correlation with occupational prestige, and that IQ tests predict the ability to stay out of jail and stay alive (all of which qualifies as practical intelligence or &quot;street smarts&quot;). Gottfredson claims that what Sternberg calls practical intelligence is not a broad aspect of cognition at all but simply a specific set of skills people learn to cope with a specific environment (task specific knowledge).

There is evidence to suggest that certain aspects of creativity (i.e. divergent thinking) are separable from analytical intelligence, and are better accounted for by the cognitive process of executive functioning. More specifically, task-switching and interference management are suggested to play an important role in divergent thinking. A more recent meta-analysis found only small correlations between IQ and creativity.

<text>The PHP Extension and Application Repository, or PEAR, is a repository of PHP software code. Stig S. Bakken founded the PEAR project in 1999 to promote the re-use of code that performs common functions. The project seeks to provide a structured library of code, maintain a system for distributing code and for managing code packages, and promote a standard coding style. Though community-driven, the PEAR project has a PEAR Group which serves as the governing body and takes care of administrative tasks. Each PEAR code package comprises an independent project under the PEAR umbrella. It has its own development team, versioning-control and documentation.

==PEAR packages==
A PEAR package is distributed as a gzipped tar file. Each archive consists of source code written in PHP, . Many PEAR packages can readily be used by developers as ordinary third party code via simple include statements in PHP. More elegantly, the PEAR package manager which comes with PHP by default may be used to install PEAR packages so that the extra functionality provided by the package appears as an integrated part of the PHP installation. Unlike the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) archives, , PEAR packages do not have implicit dependencies so that a package&#x27;s placement in the PEAR package tree does not relate to code dependencies. Rather, PEAR packages must explicitly declare all dependencies on other PEAR packages.

The PEAR base classes contain code for simulating object-oriented destructors and consistent error-handling. Packages exist for many basic PHP functions including authentication, caching, database access, encryption, configuration, HTML, web services and XML.

PEAR means “PHP Extension and Application Repository.” It is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components. It extends PHP and gives a higher level of programming for all web developers. PEAR is divided into three different classes that are: PEAR Core Components, PEAR Packages, and PECL Packages. The PEAR Packages include functionality giving for authentication, networking, and file system features and tools for working with HTML and XML templates.

== PEAR package manager ==
The PEAR package manager provides a standardized way to install, uninstall, or upgrade with new PEAR packages or PECL extensions. Before installing a package it can also be instructed to take care of package dependencies so all the extra needed packages are installed too.

The PEAR package manager is run from the command line using the codice_1 command. Usually it is therefore only the server administrator who can alter the installed base of PEAR and PECL extensions. On PHP installations running on Linux, the PEAR package manager is ready for usage by default, but on Windows the PEAR package manager is only available after running a batch file called codice_2.

== PEAR2 Pyrus ==
With Pyrus an attempt was undertaken to redesign and improve PEAR from the ground up for PHP 5.3 or newer.
Pyrus can be used to install packages from PEAR channels.
The last release is from March 2011 and its development might have been discontinued due to the popularity of Composer.

== PEAR and Composer ==
With Composer there is an alternative available for managing packages for a PHP project.
Composer also supports the installation of PEAR packages.
Some people of the PHP community argue for replacing PEAR in favor of composer.
==PECL==
The PHP Extension Community Library (PECL), (pronounced &#x27;pickle&#x27;) is conceptually very similar to PEAR, and indeed PECL modules are installed with the PEAR Package Manager. PECL contains C extensions for compiling into PHP. As C programs, PECL extensions run more efficiently than PEAR packages. PECL includes modules for XML-parsing, access to additional databases, mail-parsing, embedding Perl or Python in PHP scripts and for compiling PHP scripts. PECL spun off from the PEAR Project in October 2003. Originally it was called the PEAR Extension Code Library, but it now operates independently of PEAR.

PECL extensions are documented alongside standard extensions within the PHP Manual, so there is no special manual for PECL extensions. Also, several extensions began their development cycle in PECL and ended up in core (the distributed PHP source) and in many of these cases the PECL versions become unmaintained.

<text>Peter M. Bowers (May 15, 1918 – April 27, 2003) was an American aeronautical engineer, airplane designer, and a journalist and historian specializing in the field of aviation.

An engineer for planemaker Boeing for over 35 years,
Bowers is famed in the aviation community for his role as a military and general aviation historian and writer, and designer of the popular Bowers Fly Baby homebuilt aircraft design.

==Personal and early life ==
Bowers lived in Seattle, Washington, for most of his life.

Bowers&#x27;s first ride in an aircraft was in 1928, at the age of 10. He began intensively designing and building aircraft models, which led to requests for plans and articles about them from editors of model airplane magazines—his first article appearing in 1938 in &quot;Air Trails.&quot;

Bowers took a course in aeronautical engineering at the Boeing School of Aeronautics in Seattle, then enrolled as an Engineering Cadet in the Army Air Corps. During World War II, and after, Bowers spent five years in the U.S. Army Air Forces as a maintenance and intelligence officer, before his discharge in 1947.

==Aeronautical career==
Following his 1947 discharge from the military, Bowers went to work for The Boeing Company in Seattle, eventually becoming an aeronautical and research engineer for the company, and remained with the company for 36 years.

Bowers learned to fly in 1948, and by 1962 had reportedly logged over 3,000 hours of flight time, mostly in sailplanes, homebuilt aircraft, antique aircraft, and &quot;other romantic types&quot;—becoming &quot;an internationally-known consultant on aviation history and sport flying.&quot;

Bowers&#x27;s designing and building of model aircraft evolved into developing actual, full-size aircraft.

In 1961, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first trans-continental flight, Bowers crafted a reproduction of the Wright Brothers&#x27; Vin Fiz Flyer (first plane to fly across the U.S.). The plane was built to airworthy standards, and flown as a towed glider, before becoming a display in the San Diego Air and Space Museum.

Starting in the 1950s, and culminating in 1962, Bowers designed a noted homebuilt aircraft, the Bowers Fly Baby (winner of the 1962 Design Contest of the Experimental Aircraft Association—one of the most successful homebuilt designs, eventually built by over 500 homebuilders)

Bowers also designed and built the Namu II, and also completed and flew a Detroit G1 Gull primary glider.

Under its Fly Baby entry, &quot;Jane&#x27;s All The World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot;, 1964–1965, says of Bowers:
Mr. Peter Bowers, an aeronautical engineer with Boeing in Seattle, is a principal source of detailed information on vintage aircraft in the United States, and has provided much of the data for a number of replicas of 1914-18 War aircraft now under construction or flying. He is currently engaged on a redesign of the Fokker D.VIII monoplane of 1918 in association with Herr Rheinhold Platz, the original designer, with a view to starting a replica building program.

A full-scale Fokker Triplane replica of this period has been under construction by Mr. Bowers for nearly five years. At least six others are known to be under construction from plans that he has provided.

Another aircraft built by Mr. Bowers is a full-scale replica of the Wright Model EX of 1911, the first aeroplane to cross the American continent. This machine was tested as a towed sailplane in the Autumn of 1961 and is to be powered by a converted &quot;B&quot; Ford automobile engine from a 1938 Funk monoplane.

In addition to this work on replicas, Mr. Bowers has designed and built a single-seat light aircraft known as the Fly Baby...
Bowers was the founding president of the EAA&#x27;s Chapter 26, in the Seattle area.

==Aviation media career==
One of the principal U.S. aviation historians of the 20th century, Bowers wrote or co-authored over 40 aviation books, and several hundred magazine and journal articles. His first articles, about his model airplane designs, appeared in &quot;Air Trails&quot; magazine in 1938. By the time his plans for his full-sized airplane, the Fly Baby, began appearing in the EAA magazine &quot;Sport Aviation,&quot; in 1963, he had already published his first books about aircraft.

Bowers was an avid aviation photographer—particularly noted for photography of historic aircraft—accumulating over 25,000 negatives in his collection by 1962. The photos further supported his publications. The collection became known as one of the largest such collections in the nation, and is now in the archives of the Museum of Flight in Seattle. Bowers wrote a text on the subject, &quot;A Complete Guide to Aviation Photography&quot; (TAB Books, 1980), which was reprinted in several subsequent editions.

In the 1960s, Bowers was among a small handful of writers chronicling U.S. military aviation. He served as a contributing editor for Sentry Publications&#x27; twin magazine titles &quot;Wings&quot; and &quot;Airpower&quot;, drawing on the lifetime of aviation photographs of his own, and of a vast archive collected through his employment at Boeing.

Bowers was a member of the first board of directors of the American Aviation Historical Society (AAHS), and a principal contributor to the &quot;AAHS Journal&quot; from its first issue in 1956 until the late 1960s.

Starting in 1972, Bowers wrote over 800 articles detailing historic aircraft for a column in &quot;General Aviation News&quot; called &quot;Of Wings and Things.&quot; Bowers was a fixture of the newspaper for decades, until his death in 2003.

==Awards and recognition==

==Death==
Bowers died in 2003 from cancer.

<text>The IBM 1410, a member of the IBM 1400 series, was a decimal computer with a variable word length that was announced by IBM on September 12, 1960 and marketed as a midrange business computer. It was withdrawn on March 30, 1970.

==Overview==
The 1410 was similar in design to the very popular IBM 1401, but it had one major difference. Addresses were five characters long and allowed a maximum memory of 80,000 characters, much larger than the 16,000 characters permitted by the 1401&#x27;s three-character addresses. However, the 1410 could also be run in what was termed &quot;1401 compatibility mode&quot;. This was accomplished in hardware - the machine literally turned into a 1401 with the flip of a switch. In addition, with care, it was possible to write source code in the Autocoder assembler language that could be used on either system, as nearly all 1401 instructions had exact 1410 equivalents, and had the same mnemonics.

The later IBM 7010 used the same architecture as the 1410, but was implemented with 7000 series technology (see IBM 700/7000 series), and supported up to 100,000 characters of storage.

<doc id="852581" wikidata="Q948657" url="?curid=852581" title="Titular bishop">
<text>A titular bishop in various churches is a bishop who is not in charge of a diocese.
By definition, a bishop is an &quot;overseer&quot; of a community of the faithful, so when a priest is ordained a bishop, the tradition of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches is that he be ordained for a specific place. There are more bishops than there are functioning dioceses. Therefore, a priest appointed not to head a diocese as its diocesan bishop but to be an auxiliary bishop, a papal diplomat, or an official of the Roman Curia is appointed to a titular see.

== Catholic Church ==
In the Catholic Church, a titular bishop is a bishop who is not in charge of a diocese. Examples of bishops belonging to this category are coadjutor bishops, auxiliary bishops, bishops emeriti, vicars apostolic, nuncios, superiors of departments in the Roman Curia, and cardinal bishops of suburbicarian dioceses (since they are not in charge of the suburbicarian dioceses). Most titular bishops hold the title to a titular see. Assigning titular sees serves two purposes. Since part of being a bishop means being the head of a Christian church, titular sees serve that purpose for bishops without a diocese. At the same time, the office of titular bishop memorializes ancient Churches, most of which were suppressed because they fell into the hands of non-Christian conquerors. For this reason the former terminology was not &quot;titular bishop&quot; but &quot;bishop in infidel regions&quot; (&quot;in partibus infidelium&quot;). In recent times the names of titular sees are drawn also in numerous cases from those of former dioceses which were absorbed into other dioceses or expanded and hence moved to larger towns and cities.

Since 1970, there are two more exceptions. Diocesan bishops who resign their see or are transferred to a non-diocesan appointment are no longer habitually transferred to a titular see. Instead, they take the title &quot;Bishop&quot; (or &quot;Archbishop&quot;) &quot;Emeritus&quot; of the last see. Also, coadjutors are no longer named to titular sees, instead taking the title &quot;Coadjutor Bishop&quot; (or &quot;Coadjutor Archbishop&quot;) of the see they will inherit. In other cases titular bishops still take a titular see.

Beginning in 2019, titular sees are no longer being assigned to new Vicars Apostolic.

When Francis Green was named Coadjutor Bishop of Tucson, Arizona, in 1960, his official title remained &quot;Titular Bishop of Serra&quot; until he succeeded Daniel James Gercke later that same year. However, when Gerald Kicanas became Coadjutor Bishop of Tucson in 2001, he ceased being Titular Bishop of Bela. He remained a titular bishop until he succeeded Manuel Moreno in 2003, but his official title changed from &quot;Titular Bishop of Bela&quot; to &quot;Coadjutor Bishop of Tucson.&quot;

Cardinal Bishops of suburbicarian dioceses are also titular bishops, but unlike others, they hold titles to existing dioceses, namely one or more of the suburbicarian sees near Rome. While they do not govern their see, they are obliged to give it their patronage. Angelo Sodano, as Cardinal Bishop of Albano, was titular bishop of the see, while Bishop Marcello Semeraro is its actual diocesan bishop. The Cardinal Dean is by tradition Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, in addition to the suburbicarian see he previously held.

Occasionally, the transfer of a diocesan bishop to a titular see has been used by the Holy See to strip of responsibilities a bishop whose behavior was disapproved. For instance, in 1995, Jacques Gaillot, known for his activism on Catholic-sensitive social and political topics (such as support for contraception and abortion), was transferred from the see of Évreux in France to Partenia, a titular see in Algeria, instead of becoming Bishop Emeritus of Évreux.

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
Titular bishops and titular metropolitans are often appointed in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, titular bishops and metropolitans are usually appointed with titles of former dioceses in the regions of Thrace, Asia Minor and Pontus (now Turkey), that were often active until the Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1923. In Serbian Orthodox Church, titular bishops are usually appointed to serve as auxiliary bishops, assisting diocesan bishops in various fields of diocesan administration.

<doc id="852582" wikidata="Q6133906" url="?curid=852582" title="James Fisher (Manitoba politician)">
<text>James Fisher (November 6, 1840 – March 8, 1927) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He may have served as leader of the parliamentary opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for a brief period in the mid-1890s.

Born at Glenquaich in Perthshire, Scotland, Fisher moved to Canada West (now Ontario) in his youth. He was educated at the University of Toronto, and was a member of that body&#x27;s Senate.

In July 1875, Fisher contested a federal by-election in Perth North for the Liberals, losing to Conservative Andrew Monteith by 20 votes. He was defeated in the same riding in the general election of 1878.

Fisher subsequently moved to Winnipeg, where he practised law and was a member of the University of Manitoba Council. In 1886, he ran for the provincial riding of Russell as a Liberal, losing to Conservative Edward Leacock by eight votes. He was easily elected in his second attempt for the seat, in the Liberal landslide victory of 1888.

Fisher soon lost confidence in the government of Thomas Greenway, and crossed the floor to the opposition. He was re-elected without opposition in 1892, and appears to have served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the opposition from 1894 to 1896. He did not identify himself as a Conservative, but sat among their ranks in parliament.

Fisher was re-elected in 1896, but did not contest the election of 1899. In 1897, while still serving as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), he served in a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Expedition unit.

<doc id="852586" wikidata="Q5369664" url="?curid=852586" title="Hyangak">
<text>Hyangak, literally &quot;indigenous/native music, folks music&quot; is a traditional form of Korean court music with origins in the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC – 668 AD). It is often accompanied by traditional folk dances of Korea, known as &quot;hyangak jeongjae&quot;. These dances are performed in front of audiences—as opposed to the square dance more familiar to Westerners, which is primarily for the participants&#x27; enjoyment.

One important &quot;hyangak&quot; piece is &quot;Yeomillak&quot; (hangul: 여민락; hanja: ). Few &quot;hyangak&quot; pieces are performed in Chinese style; these include &quot;Pollyeong&quot;, &quot;Haeryeong&quot; (hangul: 해령; hanja: ), and &quot;Poheoja&quot;

== History ==
During the Unified Silla Period, Hyangak began to be used as a symmetrical concept with dangak. At that time, Hyangak included both native music from the Korean Peninsula and foreign music that had been adopted before the unified Silla Dynasty.

The literature of the Goryeo Dynasty often referred to Korean traditional court music as &#x27;Sokak&#x27; rather than &#x27;Hyangak&#x27;. During the Goryeo Dynasty, the musical instruments Of Hyangak were composed of Samhyeon and Samjook, which were handed over from the unified Silla, and foreign instruments such as janggu, haegeum, and flute.

In the Joseon Dynasty, Hyangak, and Dangak were influenced musically by one another. Hyangak, the early Joseon Dynasty, was part of a project to honor the historical legitimacy of Joseon and the new dynasty. Since the mid-sized Joseon Dynasty, the contents of the music have changed as the music changed like Hyangak, and the distinction between Hyanggak and Dangak was blurred even when using musical instruments.

<text>This is a list of quantum field theories. The first few sections are organized according to their matter content, that is, the types of fields appearing in the theory. This is just one of many ways to organize quantum field theories, but reflects the way the subject is taught pedagogically.

== Scalar field theory ==

Theories whose matter content consists of only scalar fields
*Klein-Gordon: free scalar field theory
*φ4 theory
*Sine-Gordon
*Toda field theory

== Spinor field theory ==

Theories whose matter content consists only of spinor fields
*Dirac theory: free spinor field theory
*Thirring model
*Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model
*Gross–Neveu model

== Gauge field theory ==
Theories whose matter content consists only of gauge fields
*Yang–Mills theory
*Proca theory
*Chern–Simons theory

== Interacting theories ==

*Spinor and scalar
**Yukawa model
*Scalar and gauge
**Scalar electrodynamics
**Scalar chromodynamics
**Yang–Mills–Higgs
*Spinor and gauge
**Quantum electrodynamics (QED)
***Schwinger model (1+1D case of QED)
**Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
*Scalar, spinor and gauge
**Standard Model

== Sigma models ==

*Chiral model
*Non-linear sigma model

* Pure 4D N = 1 supergravity
* 4D N = 1 supergravity
* Type I supergravity
* Type IIA supergravity
* Type IIB supergravity
* Eleven-dimensional supergravity

== String theories ==
Theories studied in the branch of quantum field theory known as string theory. These theories are without supersymmetry.
* Polyakov action
* Nambu-Goto action
* Bosonic string theory

== Other quantum field theories ==

*Kondo model (s-d model)
*Minimal model (Virasoro minimal model)

== Branches of quantum field theory ==
*String theory
