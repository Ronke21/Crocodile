<text>This is an incomplete list of some of the rebellions, revolts and revolutions that have occurred in China.

==Xia dynasty==
* The rebellion of Han Zhuo, a 20-year semi-mythological interregnum of the Xia dynasty, in which Han Zhuo murdered Xiang of Xia and installed himself as ruler until his defeat by Shao Kang and the restoration of the Xia.

==Zhou dynasty==
* Rebellion of the Three Guards (late 11th century BC) was a three-year rebellion of the Shang and three uncles of King Cheng of Zhou against their nephew and his regent, the Duke of Zhou.
* Compatriots Rebellion (842 BC) was an uprising against King Li of Zhou, ending with the King&#x27;s exile, establishing the interregnum Gonghe Regency until King Xuan of Zhou took the throne.

==Qin dynasty==
* The Dazexiang Uprising (; July – December 209 BC) was the first uprising against Qin rule following the death of Qin Shi Huang. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were both army officers who were ordered to lead their bands of commoner soldiers north to participate in the defense of Yuyang (漁陽). However, they were stopped halfway in Dazexiang, Qixian (modern Suzhou, Anhui) by a severe rainstorm and flooding. Harsh Qin law stated that anyone who showed up late for a government job would be executed, regardless of the nature of the delay. Chen and Wu realized they could never make it on time, and decided to organize a band that would rebel against the government, and declared they would rather fight than accept execution. They became the center of armed uprisings all over China, and in a few months, their strength congregated to around ten thousand men, composed mostly of discontented peasants. However, on the battlefield, they were no match for the highly professional Qin soldiers, and the uprising was in trouble in less than a year.
* Liu Bang&#x27;s Insurrection (206 BC) was a popular revolt that overthrew the Qin dynasty and, after a period of contention, crowned Liu Bang the first emperor of the Han dynasty.

==Western Han dynasty==
* The Rebellion of the Seven States or Kingdoms (, 154 BC) was a revolt by members of the Han imperial family against attempts to centralize the government under Emperor Jing.

At the beginning of the Han dynasty, Emperor Gao had made many of his relatives princes of certain sections, about one-third to one-half of the empire. This was an attempt to consolidate Liu family rule over the parts of China that were not ruled directly from the capital under the junxian (郡縣) commandery system. During the reign of Emperor Wen, these princes were still setting their own laws, but they were also casting their own coins (albeit with Emperor Wen&#x27;s approval) and collecting their own taxes. Many princes were effectively ignoring the imperial government&#x27;s authority within their own principalities. When Jing became emperor in 157 BC, the rich Principality of Wu was especially domineering. Liu Pi, therefore, started a rebellion. The princes participating were: Liu Pi, the Prince of Wu; Liu Wu, the Prince of Chu; Liu Ang, the Prince of Jiaoxi Xing; Liu Sui (劉遂), the Prince of Zhao; Liu Xiongqu (劉雄渠), the Prince of Jiaodong (roughly modern Qingdao, Shandong); Liu Xian (劉賢), the Prince of Zaichuan (roughly part of modern Weifang, Shandong); and Liu Piguang (劉辟光), the Prince of Jinan (roughly modern Jinan, Shandong)

Two other principalities agreed to join—Qi (modern central Shandong) and Jibei (modern northwestern Shandong)— but neither actually did. Liu Jianglü (劉將閭), the Prince of Qi, changed his mind at the last moment and chose to resist the rebellion forces. Liu Zhi (劉志), the Prince of Jibei, was put under house arrest by the commander of his guards and prevented from joining the rebellion. Three other princes were persuaded to join, but either refused, or did not actually agree to join Liu An (劉安), the Prince of Huainan (roughly modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui).

Other participants included Liu Ci (劉賜), the Prince of Lujiang (roughly modern Chaohu, Anhui), and Liu Bo (劉勃), the Prince of Hengshan (roughly part of modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui). The princes also requested help from the southern independent kingdoms of Donghai (modern Zhejiang) and Minyue (modern Fujian), and the powerful northern Xiongnu. Donghai and Minyue sent troops to participate in the campaign, but Xiongnu, after initially promising to do so as well, did not. The seven princes, as part of their political propaganda, claimed that Chao Cuo was aiming to wipe out the principalities, and that they would be satisfied if Chao were executed. but then he died 2 years later

==Xin dynasty==
* Lülin (綠林) or Lülin Force (綠林兵) refers, as an umbrella term, to one of the two major agrarian rebellion movements against Wang Mang&#x27;s Xin dynasty in the modern southern Henan and northern Hubei region who banded together to pool their strengths, and whose collective strength eventually led to the downfall of the Xin dynasty and the establishment of a temporary reinstatement of the Han dynasty under Liu Xuan (Gengshi Emperor). Many Lülin leaders became important members of Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s government, but infighting and incompetence (both of the emperor and his officials) in governing the empire led to the fall of the regime after only two years, paving the way for the eventual rise for Liu Xiu (Emperor Guangwu). The name Lülin came from the Lülin Mountains (in modern Yichang, Hubei), where the rebels had their stronghold for a while.

In AD 17, Jing Province (modern Hubei, Hunan, and southern Henan) was suffering from a famine that was greatly exacerbated by the corruption and incompetence of Xin officials. The victims of the famine were reduced to consuming wild plants, and even those were in short supply, causing the suffering people to attack each other. Two men named Wang Kuang (王匡) and Wang Feng (王鳳), both from Xinshi (新市, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), became arbiters in some of these disputes, and they became the leaders of the starving people. They were later joined by many others, including Ma Wu (馬武), Wang Chang (王常), and Cheng Dan (成丹). Within a few months, 7,000 to 8,000 men gathered together under their commands. They had their base at Lülin Mountain, and their modus operandi was to attack and pillage villages far from the cities for food. This carried on for several years, during which they grew to tens of thousands in size.

Wang sent messengers issuing pardons in hopes of causing these rebels to disband. Once the messengers returned to the Xin capital Chang&#x27;an, some honestly reported that the rebels gathered because the harsh laws made it impossible for them to make a living, and therefore they were forced to rebel. Some, in order to flatter Wang Mang, told him that these were simply evil resistors who needed to be killed, or that this was a temporary phenomenon. Wang listened to those who flattered him and generally relieved those who told the truth from their posts. Wang made no further attempts to pacify the rebels, but instead decided to suppress them by force. In reality, the rebels were forced into rebellion to survive, and they were hoping that eventually, when the famine was over, they could return home to farm. As a result, they never dared to attack cities.

In AD 21, the governor of Jing Province mobilized 20,000 soldiers to attack the Lülin rebels, and a battle was fought at Yundu (雲杜), a major victory for the rebels, who killed thousands of government soldiers and captured their food supply and arms. When the governor tried to retreat, his route was temporarily cut off by Ma Wu who allowed him to escape, not wanting to offend the government more than the rebels had done already. Instead, the Lülin rebels roved near the area, capturing many women, and then returning to the Lülin Mountain. By this point, they had 50,000 men.
* Chimei (赤眉) refers, as an umbrella term, to one of the two major agrarian rebellion movements against Wang Mang&#x27;s Xin dynasty, initially active in the modern Shandong and northern Jiangsu region, that eventually led to Wang Mang&#x27;s downfall by draining his resources, allowing the leader of the other movement (the Lülin), Liu Xuan (Gengshi Emperor) to overthrow Wang and temporarily establish an incarnation of the Han dynasty under him. Eventually, Chimei forces overthrew Gengshi Emperor and placed their own puppet emperor, Liu Penzi, on the throne briefly, before the Chimei leaders&#x27; incompetence in ruling the territories under their control, which matched their brilliance on the battlefield, caused the people to rebel against them, forcing them to try to withdraw home. When their path was blocked by Liu Xiu (Emperor Guangwu)&#x27;s newly established Eastern Han regime, they surrendered to him.

Circa AD 17, due to Wang Mang&#x27;s incompetence in ruling—particularly in the implementation of his land reform policy—and a major Yellow River flood affecting modern Shandong and northern Jiangsu regions, the people, who could no longer subsist on farming, were forced into rebellion to try to survive. The rebellions were numerous and fractured.

==Eastern Han dynasty==
* The Yellow Turban Rebellion or Yellow Scarves Rebellion (; AD 184) was a peasant rebellion against Emperor Ling. It is named for the scarves the rebels wrapped around their heads. They were associated with secret Taoist societies, and the rebellion marked an important point in the history of Taoism. The rebellion is the opening event in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong.

A major cause of the Yellow Turban Rebellion was an agrarian crisis where famine forced many farmers and former military settlers in the north to seek employment in the south, whose large landowners took advantage of the labor surplus and amassed large fortunes. The situation was further aggravated by smaller floods along the lower course of the Yellow River. Further pressure was added on the peasants by high taxes imposed on them in order to build fortifications along the Silk Road, and garrisons against foreign infiltrations and invasions. From AD 170 on, landlords and peasants formed irregular armed bands, setting the stage for class conflict.

At the same time, the Han dynasty showed internal weakness. The power of the landowners had been a problem for a long time already (see Wang Mang), but in the run-up to the Yellow Turban Rebellion, the court eunuchs, in particular, gained considerable influence over the emperor, which they abused to enrich themselves. Ten of the most powerful eunuchs formed a group known as the Ten Regular Attendants and the emperor referred to one of them, Zhang Rang, as his &quot;foster father.&quot; Consequently, the government was widely regarded as corrupt and incapable. Against this backdrop, the famines and floods were seen as an indication that a decadent emperor had lost his mandate of heaven.

The Yellow Turban Rebellion was led by Zhang Jiao (or Zhang Jue) and his two younger brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang, who were born in Julu District, Ye Prefecture. The brothers had founded a Taoist religious sect in Shandong Province. They considered themselves followers of the &quot;Way of Supreme Peace&quot; and venerated the deity &quot;Huang-Lao&quot;, who according to Zhang Jiao had given him a sacred book called the &quot;Crucial Keys to the Way of Peace&quot; (&quot;Tai Ping Yao Shu&quot;). Zhang Jiao was said to be a sorcerer and styled himself as the Great Teacher. The sect propagated the principles of equal rights of all peoples and equal distribution of land; when the rebellion was proclaimed, the sixteen-word slogan was created by Zhang Jiao: 苍天已死，黄天当立，岁在甲子，天下大吉 (&quot;The Blue Sky (ie. the Han dynasty) has perished, the Yellow Sky (ie. the rebellion) will soon rise; in this year of Jia Zi, let there be prosperity in the world!&quot;)
* The Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion (AD 184) was a religious rebellion instigated by Zhang Lu, the grandson of the Taoist leader Zhang Daoling. The name of the rebellion derives from the name of his movement, the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice (), in turn, named for the amount of rice paid as dues or for cures.

Early in the 2nd century AD, Zhang Daoling used his popularity as a faith healer and religious leader to organize a theological movement against the Han dynasty from the widespread poverty and corruption that oppressed the peasants under its rule. He gathered many followers from the Sichuan area by not only providing a source of hope for the disparaged, but also by reforming religious practices into a more acceptable format. This created one of the first organized religious movements in China.

In AD 184, the successor of his son Zhang Heng, his grandson Zhang Lu, revolted against the Han dynasty and created his own state, Zhang Han. This state continued for over 30 years until Zhang Lu&#x27;s defeat and surrender to the general Cao Cao. After Zhang Lu&#x27;s surrender, he relocated to the Han court where he continued to live until the Han dynasty was replaced by the Cao Wei regime. Zhang Lu then used his own popularity as a religious leader to lend legitimacy to the new Wei court, proclaiming that the Wei court had inherited divine authority from the Tao church, as well as from Confucian laws.

== Three Kingdoms (220 - 280) ==

=== Eastern Wu ===

* In 248, the people of Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen districts of Jiaozhou province rebelled against the Wu Chinese. A local woman named Triệu Ẩu in Jiuzhen led the rebellion, followed by a hundred chieftains led fifty thousand families in her revolt. The uprising of Lady Triệu is usually depicted in modern Vietnamese National History as one of many chapters constituting a &quot;long national independence struggle to end foreign domination.&quot;

==Eastern Jin dynasty==
* The Sun En Rebellion () was a rebellion led by Sun En, the nephew of an executed southern Taoist leader. The rebels planned to flee to Penglai Island after their success and the campaign was notable for its major naval battles and the government&#x27;s dependence on Liu Laozhi, a general risen from among common stock. Their discarded rafts are sometimes credited with the early formation of Chongming Island in northern Shanghai.

==Tang dynasty==
* The An Shi Rebellion (; 756–763) was a rebellion by An Lushan and Shi Siming against the Tang dynasty. It was also known as the Tianbao Rebellion () from the name of the Chinese era during which it began.

The rebellion spanned the reigns of three emperors. The first, Emperor Xuanzong, escaped to Sichuan. Along the way, his soldiers demanded the death of an official, Yang Guozhong, and his cousin, Consort Yang. Emperor Suzong, a son of Emperor Xuanzong, was proclaimed emperor by the Tang army and eunuchs, while another group of local officials and Confucian literati proclaimed another prince as the new emperor in Jinling (present-day Nanjing).

It was begun by An Lushan in the 14th year of Tianbao but, after the assassination of his son An Qingxu, the revolt was led by his former subordinate Shi Siming. The rebellion was suppressed during the reign of Emperor Daizong by generals Pugu Huai&#x27;en, Guo Ziyi and Li Guangbi. Although successful at suppressing the rebellion, the Tang dynasty was badly weakened by it, and in its remaining years was troubled by persistent warlordism.

*The Huang Chao Rebellion ( or (; 875 - 884) was a rebellion by Huang Chao.

==Yuan dynasty==
* The Red Turban Rebellion () was an uprising against the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. Since the 1340s, the Yuan dynasty was experiencing problems. The Yellow River flooded constantly, and other natural disasters also occurred. At the same time, the Yuan government required considerable military expenditure to maintain its vast empire. This was solved mostly through additional taxation that fell mainly on the Han Chinese population which constituted the lowest two of the four castes of people under Yuan rule — much influenced by the White Lotus Society members that targeted the ruling Yuan government.

==Ming dynasty==
* Li Zicheng&#x27;s rebellion was a peasant rebellion aimed at the overthrow of the Ming dynasty; it led to the establishment of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. Li Zicheng began recruiting troops at Xi&#x27;an in Shaanxi province, and later went on to gain power throughout northeastern China. From 1620, towards the end of the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign, social and economic conditions under Ming rule worsened drastically. Li Zicheng did not become the emperor, but he paved the way for the rising of the new Qing dynasty, after overthrowing the Ming emperor by capturing Beijing and declaring the short-lived Shun dynasty. The Qing troops, arriving from the northeast (originally from Manchuria) were allied with Wu Sangui, a former Ming general, an alliance which eventually led to the defeat of Li Zicheng, though the impact of his rebellion was tremendous.
* There were also other peasant rebellions at the time, such as those led by Zhang Xianzhong who ruled Sichuan and declared the short-lived Xi dynasty.
* Nurhaci who established the Later Jin dynasty was often regarded the founding father of the Qing dynasty. He was originally a vassalage to the Ming dynasty and later renounced the Ming overlordship and rebelled against the Ming with the Seven Grievances.

==Qing dynasty==

===Revolt of the Three Feudatories===
The Revolt of the Three Feudatories was led by three territories () in southern China bestowed by the early Manchu rulers on three Han Chinese generals — Wu Sangui, Geng Jingzhong, and Shang Zhixin. In the second half of the 17th century, they revolted against the Qing government. This rebellion came as the Qing rulers were establishing themselves after their conquest of China in 1644 and was the last serious threat to their &quot;imperium&quot; until the 19th-century conflicts that ultimately brought about the end of the dynasty in 1912. The revolt was followed by almost a decade of civil war which extended across the breadth of China.

In 1655, the Qing government granted Wu Sangui, a man to whom they were indebted for the conquest of China, both civil and military authority over the province of Yunnan. In 1662, after the execution of Zhu Youlang, the last claimant to the Ming throne, Wu was also given jurisdiction over Guizhou. In the next decade he consolidated his power, and by 1670 his influence had spread to include much of Hunan, Sichuan, Gansu and even Shaanxi. Two other powerful defected military leaders also developed similar powers: Shang Zhixin in Guangdong and Geng Jingzhong in Fujian. They ruled their feudatories (territories) as their own domains and the Qing government had virtually no control over the provinces in the south and southwest.

By 1672, the Kangxi Emperor had determined that these feudatories were a threat to the Qing regime. In 1673, Shang Zhixin submitted a memorial requesting permission to retire and in August of the same year, a similar request arrived from Wu Sangui, designed to test the court&#x27;s intentions. The Kangxi Emperor went against the majority view in the Council of Princes and High Officials and accepted the request. News of Wu&#x27;s rebellion reached Beijing in January 1674.

===White Lotus Rebellion===
The White Lotus Rebellion (1796–1804) was an anti-Qing uprising that occurred during the Qing dynasty.

It broke out among impoverished settlers in the mountainous region that separates Sichuan province from Hubei and Shaanxi provinces. It apparently began as a tax protest led by the White Lotus Society, a secret religious society that forecasted the advent of the Buddha Maitreya, advocated the restoration of the Ming dynasty, and promised personal salvation to its followers. At first, the Qing government, under the control of Heshen, sent inadequate and inefficient imperial forces to suppress the ill-organized rebels. On assuming effective power in 1799, however, the Jiaqing Emperor (r. 1796-1820) overthrew Heshen&#x27;s clique and gave support to the efforts of the more vigorous Qing commanders as a way of restoring discipline and morale. A systematic program of pacification followed in which the populace was resettled in hundreds of stockaded villages and organized into a militia by the name of &quot;tuanlian&quot;. In its last stage, the Qing suppression policy combined pursuit and extermination of rebel guerrilla bands with a program of amnesty for deserters. Although the Qing finally crushed the rebellion, the myth of the military invincibility of the Manchus was shattered, perhaps contributing to the greater frequency of rebellions in the 19th century.

===Eight Trigrams uprising of 1813===
The Eight Trigrams uprising of 1813 broke out in China under the Qing dynasty. The rebellion was started by some elements of the millenarian Tianli Sect (天理教) or Heavenly Principle Sect, which was a branch of the White Lotus Sect. Led by Lin Qing (林清; 1770–1813) and Li Wencheng, the revolt occurred in the Zhili, Shandong, and Henan provinces of China.

In 1812, the leaders of the Eight Trigram Sect (Bagua jiao) also known as the Sect of Heavenly Order (Tianli jiao) announced that leader Li Wencheng was a &#x27;true lord of the Ming&#x27; and declared 1813 as the year for rebellion, while Lin Qing declared himself the reincarnation of Maitreya, the prophesied future Buddha in Buddhism, using banners with the inscription &quot;Entrusted by Heaven to Prepare the Way&quot;, a reference to the popular novel Water Margin. They considered him sent by the Eternal Unborn Mother of esoteric Chinese religions, to remove the Qing dynasty whom they regarded as having lost the Mandate of Heaven to rule.

The third leader was Feng Keshan, who was called the &quot;King of Earth&quot;, Li titled the &quot;King of Men&quot;, and Lin referred to as &quot;King of Heaven&quot;.

The group won support from several powerful Eunuchs in the Forbidden City. On 15 September 1813, the group attacked the imperial palace in Beijing. The rebels made it into the city, and may have been successful in overthrowing the Qing had not Prince Mianning—the future emperor—used his forbidden musket to repel the invaders.

The rebellion is seen as being similar to the previous White Lotus Rebellion, with the former being of religious intent and the latter leaders of the Eight Trigram appearing more interested in personal power by overthrowing the Qing dynasty.

===Taiping Rebellion===

The Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864), usually known in Chinese after the name of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom () proclaimed by the rebels, was a rebellion in southern China inspired by a Hakka named Hong Xiuquan, who had claimed that he was the brother of Jesus Christ. Most sources put the total deaths at about 20 million, although some claim tolls as high as 50 million. Altogether, some historians have estimated that political insurrections such as the rebellion combined with natural disasters may have cost on the order of 200 million Chinese lives between 1850–1865. The figure is unlikely, as it is approximately half the estimated population of China in 1851.

Hong Xiuquan gathered his support in a time of considerable turmoil. The country had suffered a series of natural disasters, economic problems and defeats at the hands of the Western powers, problems that the ruling Qing dynasty did little to lessen. Anti-Qing sentiment was strongest in the south, and it was these disaffected that joined Hong. The sect extended into militarism in the 1840s, initially against banditry. The persecution of the sect was the spur for the struggle to develop into guerrilla warfare and then into full-blown war. The revolt began in Guangxi province. In early January 1851, a ten-thousand-strong rebel army routed Qing imperial forces at the town of Jintian in the Jintian Uprising. The Qing forces attacked but were driven back. In August 1851, Hong declared the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom with himself as absolute ruler. The revolt spread northwards with great rapidity. 500,000 Taiping soldiers took Nanjing in March 1853, killing 30,000 Qing soldiers and slaughtering thousands of civilians. The city became the movement&#x27;s capital and was renamed Tianjing (lit. &quot;Heavenly Capital&quot;; not to be confused with Tianjin) until its recapture.

===Nian Rebellion===

The Nian Rebellion (; 1851–1868) was a large armed uprising that took place in northern China. The rebellion failed to topple the Qing dynasty, but caused immense economic devastation and loss of life that became one of the major long-term factors in the collapse of the Qing regime.

The Nian movement was formed in the late 1840s by Zhang Lexing and, by 1851, numbered approximately 40,000. Unlike the Taiping Rebellion, though, the Nian movement initially had no clear goals or objectives aside from criticism of the Qing government. However, the Nian rebels were provoked into taking direct action against the Qing regime following a series of ecological disasters. In 1851, the Yellow River burst its banks, flooding hundreds of thousands of square miles and causing immense loss of life. The Qing government slowly began cleaning up after the disaster, but were unable to provide effective aid as government finances had been drained during the Opium War with the British, and the ongoing slaughter of the Taiping Rebellion. The damage created by the disaster had still not been repaired when, in 1855, the river burst its banks again, drowning thousands and devastating the fertile province of Jiangsu. At the time, the Qing government was trying to negotiate a deal with the Western powers, and as state finances had been so severely depleted, the regime was unable to provide effective relief aid. This enraged the Nian movement, who blamed the Westerners for contributing to China&#x27;s troubles, and increasingly viewed the Qing government as incompetent and cowardly in the face of the Western powers.

In 1855, Zhang Lexing took direct action by launching attacks against government troops in central China. By the summer, the fast-moving Nian cavalry, well-trained and fully equipped with modern firearms, had cut the lines of communication between Beijing and the Qing armies fighting the Taiping rebels in the south. Qing forces were badly overstretched as rebellions broke out across China, allowing the Nian armies to conquer large tracts of land and gain control over economically vital areas. The Nian fortified their captured cities and used them as bases to launch cavalry attacks against Qing troops in the countryside, prompting local towns to fortify themselves against Nian raiding parties. This resulted in constant fighting which devastated the previously rich provinces of Jiangsu and Hunan.

In early 1856, the Qing government sent the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen, who had recently crushed a large Taiping rebel army, to defeat the Nian. Sengge Rinchen&#x27;s army captured several fortified cities and destroyed most of the Nian infantry, and killed Zhang Lexing himself in an ambush. However, the Nian movement survived as Taiping commanders arrived to take control of the Nian forces, and the bulk of the Nian cavalry remained intact. Sengge Rinchen&#x27;s infantry-based army could not stop the fast moving cavalry from devastating the countryside and launching surprise attacks on Qing troops. In 1865, Sengge Rinchen and his bodyguards were ambushed by Nian troops and killed, depriving the government of its best military commander. The Qing regime sent general Zeng Guofan to take command of Qing imperial forces, providing him with modern artillery and weapons, purchased from the Europeans at extortionate prices. Zeng&#x27;s army set about building canals and trenches to hem in the Nian cavalry — an effective, but slow and expensive method. Zeng was removed from the post after the Nian rebels broke one of his defense fronts. Generals Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang were put in charge of the suppression. In late 1866, the Nian movement split into two — east Nian stayed in central China and west Nian sneaked close to Beijing. By late 1867, Li and Zuo&#x27;s troops had recaptured much territory from the Nian rebels, and in early 1868, the movement was crushed by the combined forces of imperial troops and the Ever Victorious Army.

===Du Wenxiu Rebellion===

The Du Wenxiu Rebellion, or Panthay Rebellion (1856–1872) was a separatist movement of Muslim Hui in western Yunnan, led by Du Wenxiu (born Sulayman ibn `Abd ar-Rahman).

Du claimed the title of &quot;Qa´id Jami al-Muslimin&quot; (&quot;Leader of the Community of Muslims&quot;). He was known in English as the Sultan of Dali upon the city&#x27;s capture. It became the base for the rebels, who declared themselves &quot;Pingnan&quot; (). The rebels besieged the city of Kunming four times (1857, 1861, 1863, and 1868) and briefly held the city during the third attempt. Later, as Qing forces began to gain the upper hand against the rebellion, the rebels sent a letter to Queen Victoria, asking the British for formal recognition and for military assistance; the British demurred. The rebellion was eventually suppressed by Qing troops, who killed and posthumously decapitated Du. The brutal suppression led to many Hui people fleeing to neighboring countries bordering Yunnan. Surviving Huis escaped to Burma, Thailand and Laos, forming the basis of a minority Chinese Hui population in those nations. Hundreds of thousands of Hui people were massacred or died in these purges.

The rebellion had a significant negative impact on the Burmese Konbaung dynasty. After losing lower Burma to the British, Burma lost access to vast tracts of rice-growing land. Not wishing to upset China, the Burmese kingdom agreed to refuse trade with the Hui rebels in accordance with China&#x27;s demands. Without the ability to import rice from China, Burma was forced to import rice from the British. In addition, the Burmese economy had relied heavily on cotton exports to China, and suddenly lost access to the vast Chinese market.

===Dungan revolts===
In the Jahriyya revolt sectarian violence between two suborders of the Naqshbandi Sufis, the Jahriyya Sufi Muslims and their rivals, the Khafiyya Sufi Muslims, led to a Jahriyya Sufi Muslim rebellion which the Qing dynasty in China crushed with the help of the Khafiyya Sufi Muslims.

The First Dungan Revolt or Muslim Rebellion (; 1862–1877), known in China as the Hui Minority War, was an uprising by members of the Muslim Hui community in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia.

Chinese Muslims had been traveling to West Asia for many years prior to the Hui Minorities&#x27; War. Some of them had adopted radical Sufi Islamic teachings referred to as New Teachings. There had been attempted uprisings by followers of these New Teachings in 1781 and 1783. In 1862 the prestige of the Qing dynasty was low and their armies were busy elsewhere. In 1867 the Qing government sent one of their best officials, Zuo Zongtang, a hero of the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion, to Shaanxi. His forces were ordered to help put down the Nian Rebellion, and he was unable to deal with the Muslim rebels until December 1868. Zuo&#x27;s approach was to rehabilitate the region by promoting agriculture, especially cotton and grain, as well as supporting orthodox Confucian education. Due to the poverty of the region, Zuo had to rely on financial support from outside the North-West. After building up enough grain reserves to feed his army, Zuo attacked the most important Muslim leader, Ma Hualong. Ma was besieged in the city of Jinjibao for sixteen months before surrendering in March 1871. Zuo sentenced Ma and over eighty of his officials to death by slicing. Thousands of Muslims were exiled to different parts of China. Despite repeated offers of amnesty, many Muslims continued to resist until the fall of Suzhou in Gansu. The failure of the uprising in 1873 led to some immigration of Hui people into Russia. The descendants of the immigrants continue to live in the border region of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.

The Second Dungan Revolt (1895–1896), known in China as the Second Hui Minority War, was a second Muslim revolt against the Qing. They were defeated by loyalist Muslim troops.

===Boxer Rebellion===
The Boxer Rebellion () or Uprising (; November 1899 –September 7, 1901) was a revolt against European commercial, political, religious, and technological influence in China. By August 1900, over 230 foreigners, thousands of Chinese Christians, an unknown number of rebels and sympathizers and other Chinese were killed in the revolt and its suppression.

In 1840, the First Opium War broke out, and China was defeated by Britain. In view of the weakness of the Qing government, Britain and other nations such as France, Russia and Japan started to exert influence over China. Due to their inferior army and navy, the Qing dynasty was forced to sign many agreements which became known as the Unequal Treaties. These include the Treaty of Nanking (1842), the Treaty of Aigun (1858), the Treaty of Tientsin (1858), the Convention of Peking (1860), the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895), and the Second Convention of Peking (1898).

Such treaties were regarded as grossly unfair by many Chinese, whose prestige was sorely damaged by the treaties, as foreigners were perceived to receive special treatment compared to Chinese. Rumours circulated of foreigners committing crimes as a result of agreements between foreign and the Chinese governments over how foreigners in China should be prosecuted. In Guizhou, local officials were reportedly shocked to see a cardinal using a sedan chair decorated in the same manner as one reserved for the governor. The Catholic Church&#x27;s prohibition on some Chinese rituals and traditions was another issue of contention. Thus in the late 19th century such feelings increasingly resulted in civil disobedience and violence towards both foreigners and Chinese Christians.

The rebellion was initiated by a society known as the Boxers (Chinese: Righteous Harmony Society), a group which initially opposed—but later reconciled itself to—the Qing dynasty. The Boxer Rebellion was concentrated in northern China where the European powers had begun to demand territorial, rail and mining concessions. Germany responded to the killing of two missionaries in Shandong province in November 1897 by seizing the port of Qingdao. A month later a Russian naval squadron took possession of Lushun, in southern Liaoning. Britain and France followed, taking possession of Weihai and Zhanjiang respectively.

===Xinhai Revolution===

The Xinhai Revolution () was a republican revolution which overthrew the Qing dynasty and led to the establishment of the Republic of China. The revolution ended the monarchy which had a history for 4000 years in China and replaced it with a republic, with democratic ideals. The ensuing revolutionary war lasted from October 10, 1911, and ended upon the formation of the Republic of China on February 12, 1912. Since 1911 is a Xinhai Year in the sexagenary cycle of the Chinese calendar, this is how Xinhai Revolution had got its name.

The revolution began with the armed Wuchang Uprising and the spread of republican insurrection through the southern provinces, and culminated in the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor after lengthy negotiations between rival imperial and republican regimes based in Beijing and Nanjing respectively.

The revolution inaugurated a period of struggle over China&#x27;s eventual constitutional form, which saw two brief monarchical restorations and successive periods of political fragmentation before the Republic&#x27;s final establishment.

The Xinhai Revolution is commemorated as the National Day of the Republic of China, also known as Double Ten Day (雙十節). Today the National Day is mainly celebrated in Taiwan. In addition, numerous overseas Chinese also celebrate Double Ten Day and events are usually held in Chinatowns across the world.

A plan backed by foreign bankers was reported in place to declare the Duke Yansheng as Emperor of China as a Han emperor, if the revolutionary&#x27;s republican plan failed.

==Republic of China==
After Western ideologies came to China during the May Fourth Movement, Li Dazhao and other communists established the Chinese Communist Party in 1921 with the support of the Comintern. Communist Party members are allowed to join the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party), which, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, was seeking an alliance to end the Warlord Era and unify China. As the new leader of the KMT, Chiang Kai-shek, launched the Northern Expedition to unify China in 1924. Conservatives within the KMT in Nanking grew hostile to the communists, while the leftists in Wuhan were in favour of the alliance with them. The first KMT-CCP alliance was broken when communists were arrested and executed in Shanghai in the April 12 Purge. The Communists, under the leadership of Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, rebelled against the National Revolutionary Army at the Nanchang Uprising on 1 August 1927, and consequently established the Chinese Soviet Republic which controlled the self-proclaimed &quot;Soviet Area&quot; in Jiangxi. The headquarters of the secessionist republic was recovered by the Nationalist Government in 1934 but the communists evaded the Nationalist Revolutionary Army in the Long March and retreated to Shaanxi.

There was a temporary cease-fire when the second KMT-CCP alliance was formed in 1937 to combat the Japanese invasion. The Chinese Soviet Republic was renamed Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, and the communist-led Chinese Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Red Army became the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army. All these changes were nominal, however, as the CCP expanded in power and its fighting with the government persisted in the course of the war. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Communists took over several regions formerly occupied by Japan. Full-scale war broke out amid the adoption of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947. By October 1949, the Communists occupied most of the Mainland China, and Mao Zedong of the CCP declared the People&#x27;s Republic of China in Beijing. The Government of the Republic of China relocated to Taipei and has failed to retake the mainland since then. Taiwan and part of Fujian Province became known as the Free Area of the Republic of China, despite constant threats of communist invasion. The Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion remained in effect until 1991.

<doc id="847063" wikidata="Q48965" url="?curid=847063" title="Carl Wernicke">
<text>Carl (or Karl) Wernicke (; ; 15 May 1848 – 15 June 1905) was a German physician, anatomist, psychiatrist and neuropathologist. He is known for his influential research into the pathological effects of specific forms of encephalopathy and also the study of receptive aphasia, both of which are commonly associated with Wernicke&#x27;s name and referred to as Wernicke encephalopathy and Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, respectively. His research, along with that of Paul Broca, led to groundbreaking realizations of the localization of brain function, specifically in speech. As such, Wernicke&#x27;s area (a.k.a. Wernicke&#x27;s Speech Area) has been named after the scientist.

== Biography ==
Wernicke was born on May 15, 1848, in Tarnowitz, a small town in Upper Silesia, Prussia, now Tarnowskie Góry, Poland. He obtained his secondary education at the Königliche Gymnasium in Oppeln and the Maria-Magdalenen-Gymnasium in Breslau. Wernicke then studied medicine at the University of Breslau and did graduate work studying language and aphasia at Breslau, Berlin, and Vienna.

After he earned his medical degree at the University of Breslau (1870), he worked in Breslau at Allerheiligen Hospital as an assistant to an ophthalmology professor Ostrid Foerster for six months. In 1870, the Franco-Prussian War broke out, where Wernicke served as an army surgeon. After serving in the war, he returned to the Allerheiligen Hospital and worked in the psychiatric department as an assistant under Professor Heinrich Neumann. Neumann sent him to Vienna for six months to study with neuropathologist Theodor Meynert, who would have a profound influence upon Wernicke&#x27;s career.

In 1875, Wernicke was appointed the first assistant in the Charité in Berlin under Karl Westphal, where he stayed until 1878 studying psychiatry and nervous diseases.

In 1878 Wernicke founded a private neuropsychiatric practice in Berlin and published numerous articles until he left the practice in 1881. In 1885, he succeeded his mentor Professor Neumann and served as associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at Breslau, where he also attained a conference chair. By 1890 Wernicke became the director of the psychiatric wing at the Allerheiligen Hospital, and he also became head of the University Hospital&#x27;s Department of Neurology and Psychiatry. In 1904, Wernicke worked at the University of Halle, heading its Psychiatry and Neurology Clinic.

Wernicke died on June 15, 1905, due to injuries suffered from a bicycle accident in the Thuringian Forest.

==Studies in aphasia==

Wernicke was heavily inspired by the research on language and communication coming from Paris, France, specifically from Paul Pierre Broca. Broca&#x27;s work on motor aphasia influenced Wernicke&#x27;s interests in psychophysiology and aphasiology relating to language. Wernicke began to question the relationship between dysphasia and the location of lesions that caused brain damage resulting in language problems.

While studying with Meynert in 1874, Wernicke published &quot;Der Aphasische Symptomencomplex&quot;. In his book, Wernicke described sensory aphasia, which is now known as Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, as being distinctly different from motor aphasia, described by Broca. He categorized sensory aphasia as fluent but disordered speech, impaired understanding of speech, and impaired silent reading. Incorporating Broca&#x27;s findings on motor aphasia, Wernicke described both forms of aphasia as being results of brain damage. However, the location of damage determined which aphasia a patient developed. He described sensory aphasia as a result from lesions to the left temporal lobe and motor / Broca&#x27;s aphasia as a result from lesions to the left posterior frontal lobe. These two concepts were the foundation for his theory on the neural bases of language.

Wernicke hypothesized that motor activity was accompanied by sensory stimulation and that there were fibers connected the motor and sensory cortexes in the brain, so there must also be a connection between the lesioned areas contributing to sensory and motor aphasia. He discussed the problems with severing this connection, assuming both structures remain intact. The area affecting sensory aphasia would still function, so a patient could hypothetically retain comprehension of oral speech and silent reading. However, the connection to Broca&#x27;s area would be broken, causing prevention of effective translation of mental processes into verbal speech.

Wernicke additionally discussed the dangers of mistaking sensory aphasia with a confused or psychotic state, and he emphasized the importance of distinguishing between aphasia and agnosia, the failure to recognize objects, which was described by Sigmund Freud in 1891.

Wernicke proposed a theory of localization and suggested that different identifiable regions of the brain control different behaviors and these areas interact to produce more behaviors. This is the case with Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s areas interacting to produce language. Broca and Wernicke&#x27;s work paved the way for others to study and identify localized areas of the brain, including the identification of the motor homunculus as well as the theory that brain damage in specific areas is responsible for different disorders, diseases, and abnormal behaviors.

Ludwig Lichtheim, a professor of medicine at Bern University Hospital, wrote his work &quot;Über Aphasie,&quot; which was influenced by Broca, Wernicke and Adolf Kussmaul. Lichtheim&#x27;s work analyzed language abilities and categorized language disorders into seven different aphasias, Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia being one of them. Wernicke then adopted Lichtheim&#x27;s aphasia classification and became the Wernicke-Lichtheim model.

== The Elementary Symptom ==
At the 59th Breslau conference in 1892, Karl Kahlbaum described paranoia based on a case study that Wernicke was familiar with. Wernicke described the case study as an example of what he called the &quot;elementary symptom,&quot; which is the notion that there is a single, fundamental symptom and all other symptoms are derived from the elementary symptom.

Karl Leonhard also followed Wernicke&#x27;s studies. Although Leonhard rejected the &quot;elementary symptom&quot; theory because it overgeneralizes symptoms of disorders, he did incorporate Wernicke&#x27;s psychopathological categories of disorders into Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s binary system of classification. For example, Leonhard renamed Wernicke&#x27;s &quot;anxiety-psychosis&quot; as &quot;cycloid psychosis,&quot; which does resemble schizophrenia and Bipolar cycling. Kraepelin also rejected the elementary symptom theory by describing all of the clinical aspects of a particular disorder (nosology) in contrast to Wernicke&#x27;s theory, which attempted to home in on the key symptom instead of looking at each disorder as a whole.

The theory of elementary symptom was generally rejected and is not a well-known concept today because of the lack of supporting evidence for the theory. Although the theory itself is not supported in modern nosology and etiology, it does have a general influence in psychopharmacology practices with its notion of a target symptom. Clinical psychopharmacology typically treats particular symptoms instead of disorders and diagnoses as a whole. Modern psychiatry does rest on assumptions that some symptoms result from other symptoms, parallel to Wernicke&#x27;s theory.

Wernicke himself did not pursue research on the elementary symptom theory because of his devotion to aphasiology. One of the fundamental problems with the elementary symptom theory is that Wernicke described anxiety as the elementary symptom of many disorders. This was problematic for the theory because anxiety, to some extent, is seen in almost all psychiatric disorders. This caused the elementary symptom to fail at categorizing clinical descriptions and proper treatments. Another difficulty for Wernicke and other psychologists was determining which symptom was the elementary symptom and given priority over other symptoms that might be just as important to treat and might not be a direct result of another symptom. Lastly, Wernicke preserved traditional German psychiatry and described clinical vignettes, being unable to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of symptoms instead of using Kraepelin&#x27;s approach of delineation of syndromes and disorders.

==Eponyms==
* Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia: The eponymous term for receptive or sensory aphasia. It is the inability to understand speech, or to produce meaningful speech, caused by lesions to the posterior superior temporal gyrus.
* Wernicke encephalopathy: An acute neurological dysfunction caused by a thiamine deficiency. It is characterized by the triad of ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and mental confusion. When combined with Korsakoff psychosis, a subacute dementia syndrome, it is then called Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome.
* Wernicke&#x27;s pupillary reaction: The absence of direct reaction to light in the blind part of the retina. First described by ophthalmologist Hermann Wilbrand in 1881.
*Wernicke&#x27;s centre
*Wernicke&#x27;s cramp
*Wernicke&#x27;s dementia
*Wernicke&#x27;s disease
*Wernicke-Korsakoff disease
*Wernicke-Mann hemiplegia

== Publications ==
In 1897, with Theodor Ziehen (1862-1950), he founded the journal &quot;Monatsschrift für Psychiatrie und Neurologie&quot;.

Conference proceedings from Breslau were published in the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitschrift fur Psychiatrie und Psychische-Gerichtliche Medizin&quot;.

Principal written works by Wernicke include:
* &quot;Der aphasische Symptomencomplex. Eine psychologische Studie auf anatomischer Basis [The aphasic symptom complex: a psychological study from an anatomical basis]&quot;; Breslau, M. Crohn und Weigert, 1874.

*&quot;Lehrbuch der Gehirnkrankheiten : für Aerzte und Studirende [Textbook of brain diseases: for doctors and students]&quot;, 1881.
* &quot;Über hemiopische Pupillenreaktion [On hemianopsic pupillary response]&quot;, in Fortschritte der Medicin, 1883, 1: 49–53.
* &quot;Grundriss der Psychiatrie in klinischen Vorlesungen [Foundation of psychiatry in clinical lectures]&quot;, 1894.

<text>Langort is a position in the German School of historical fencing. In the Langort position, the point of the sword is extended. The term appears first in Royal Armouries Ms. I.33. 

In modern literature, sometimes it is identified with the position &quot;vom tage&quot; in the system of Johannes Liechtenauer, according to Ms. Nürnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a. Although &quot;vom tage&quot; is executed with both hands and sword high over the head, while &quot;Langort&quot; is executed with both hands pointing away from the body, directly at the contrahent. 
Also, &quot;vom tage&quot; is a very active position that gives you the opportunity to start a variety of attacks, while &quot;Langort&quot; is highly defensive and passive, mostly used to force a contrahent with shorter blade to keep distance. The only real possibility to attack while standing in this position is by running into a highly incautious opponent. 
Otherwise standing in this position means to force your contrahent to either attack your blade or to run into the sword, which can create nearly insurmountable situations in combat.

<text>Minimum harmonisation is a term used in European Union law.

Minimum harmonisation describes a piece of law (usually a directive but occasionally a regulation) that sets a threshold national legislation must meet. EU Member State national legislation may exceed the terms of minimum harmonisation law. 

Much EU legislation has been implemented on a minimum harmonization basis as it can be easier to reach agreement, allowing existing EU Member State national legislation on issues such as consumer protection or the environment to remain in place. 

In more recent years, the burden of EU law has led to calls for deregulation and accusations that some member states indulge in protectionism when implementing directives into EU Member State national law by gold-plating. Therefore, on the opposite end of the regulation spectrum, a growing minority of EU law contains maximum harmonisation provisions.

It is quite common for a directive or recommendation to consist of a mixture of minimum harmonisation and maximum harmonisation clauses.

<doc id="847076" wikidata="Q912435" url="?curid=847076" title="Shakudō">
<text>Shakudō (赤銅) is a Japanese billon of gold and copper (typically 4–10% gold, 96–90% copper), one of the &quot;irogane&quot; class of colored metals, which can be treated to develop a black, or sometimes indigo, patina, resembling lacquer. Unpatinated &quot;shakudō&quot; visually resembles bronze; the dark color is induced by the &quot;niiro&quot; artificial patination process, involving boiling in a solution, generally including &quot;rokushō&quot;.

==Naming==
The characters in the name &quot;shaku-dō&quot; mean &quot;red&quot; and &quot;copper&quot; but combined they represent this material which begins with a darkened coppery-bronze color and is then modified to black or near-black.

==History==
===Early uses===
The word &quot;shakudō&quot; first appears in records of the Japanese Nara period (710-794 AD), but it is not clear to what it referred (it could have been some form of copper, or a form of the now-known material). There are actual pieces known from the 12th century onwards. Shakudō was historically used to construct or decorate Japanese sword (&quot;nihonto&quot;) fittings such as tsuba, menuki, and kozuka, as well as other small ornaments, sliding door catches, and small boxes.

===Introduction to the West===
Shakudō was introduced to the West in the mid-19th century. 

===Possible origins===
Materials like shakudo were historically thought to be specific to the Chinese and Japanese, and perhaps other Asian, milieu, but recent studies have noted close similarities to certain decorative alloys used in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. 

==Production==
The origins of shakudo date back to a period when Japan was still importing significant techniques and materials from Korea and China, but accounts of production all derive from much later, and little is known of their evolution. By the Meiji period, the initial production process entailed the heating of copper, addition of fine gold, and some addition of shirome, a by-product of copper production containing iron, arsenic and other elements. In the Edo period, it appears that the process may have used nigurome rather than copper; nigurome being itself a pre-made mix of copper and shirome. The resulting alloy was then allowed to rest in ingot moulds in heated water, before being shaped, and annealed at around 650 °C. In cooled form, the metal was then surface-finished using the niiro process. The modern process tends to omit the shirome, working with copper and gold, and other additives directly if needed.

==Use==
Due to the expensive gold content, shakudō was normally limited to accents or small items such as tsuba. Larger historical objects (such as vases) that are described as shakudō may be mislabeled, especially if the glossy blue-black color is not evident. Unpatinated or repolished shakudō will not spontaneously patinate in air.

Modern artisans have revived the use of shakudō as a striking design element, in the making of jewelry, vessels, and for the technique of mokume-gane.

Shakudō is sometimes inaccurately used as a general term for damascened decorative metal inlays of Japanese origin. These were widely known in the West as Amita damascene, from the name of a 20th-century manufacturer of such items for export. Amita damascene included shakudo, shibuichi, gold, silver, and bronze for inlays.

<text>Maximum harmonisation is a term used in EU law.

If a piece of law (usually a directive but occasionally also a regulation) is described as maximum harmonisation, national law may not exceed the terms of the legislation. In practice, that prohibits gold-plating of EU legislation when it is transposed into national law. 

It may also result in the repeal or amendment of existing national law, such as the effect of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive on the British Trade Descriptions Act 1968.

Traditionally it was fairly uncommon for European legislation to be drafted on such a basis. However, deregulation has risen in the political agenda in the EU, as have concerns that member states occasionally use the national implementation of EU law as an opportunity to indulge in backdoor protectionism.

It is quite common for a directive or recommendation to consist of a mixture of maximum harmonisation and minimum harmonisation clauses.

<doc id="847078" wikidata="Q182537" url="?curid=847078" title="Taxman">
<text>&quot;Taxman&quot; is a song by English rock band the Beatles, from their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;. Written by the group&#x27;s lead guitarist, George Harrison, with some lyrical assistance from John Lennon, it protests against the higher level of progressive tax imposed in the United Kingdom by the Labour government of Harold Wilson, which saw the Beatles paying a 95% supertax. The song was selected as the album&#x27;s opening track and contributed to Harrison&#x27;s emergence as a songwriter beside the dominant Lennon–McCartney partnership. It was the group&#x27;s first topical song and the first political statement they had made in their music.

The Beatles began recording &quot;Taxman&quot; in April 1966, a month after Wilson&#x27;s landslide win in the 1966 general election. Coinciding with the song&#x27;s creation, Harrison learned that the band members&#x27; tax obligations were likely to lead to their bankruptcy, and he was outspoken in his opposition to the government using their income to help fund the manufacture of military weapons. Drawing on 1960s soul/R&amp;B musical influences, the song portrays the taxman as relentless in his pursuit of revenue, and mentions by name Wilson and Edward Heath, the leader of the Conservative Party. The recording includes an Indian-influenced guitar solo performed by Paul McCartney.

&quot;Taxman&quot; was influential in the development of British psychedelia and mod-style pop, and has been recognised as a precursor to punk rock. The Jam borrowed heavily from the song for their 1980 hit single &quot;Start!&quot; When performing &quot;Taxman&quot; on tour in the early 1990s, Harrison adapted the lyrics to reference contemporaneous leaders, citing its enduring quality beyond the 1960s. The song&#x27;s impact has extended to the tax industry and into political discourse on taxation.

==Background and inspiration==
George Harrison wrote &quot;Taxman&quot; at a time when the Beatles discovered they were in a financially precarious position. In April 1966, a report from the London accountancy firm Bryce, Hammer, Isherwood &amp; Co. advised them that despite the group&#x27;s immense success, &quot;Two of you are close to being bankrupt, and the other two could soon be.&quot; In his 1980 autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, Harrison says: Taxman&#x27; was when I first realised that even though we had started earning money, we were actually giving most of it away in taxes; it was and still is typical.&quot; As their earnings placed them in the top tax bracket in the United Kingdom, the Beatles were liable to a 95% supertax introduced by Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government; hence the lyric &quot;There&#x27;s one for you, nineteen for me&quot;.

John Lennon helped Harrison complete the song&#x27;s lyrics. Lennon recalled in 1980: &quot;I threw in a few one-liners to help the song along, because that&#x27;s what he asked for. He came to me because he couldn&#x27;t go to Paul [McCartney], because Paul wouldn&#x27;t have helped him at that period.&quot; Lennon said he was reluctant to agree to Harrison&#x27;s request, since it was &quot;enough to do my own and Paul&#x27;s [songs]&quot;, but he did so &quot;because I loved him and didn&#x27;t want to hurt his feelings&quot;.

Aside from the financial imposition, &quot;Taxman&quot; was informed by Harrison&#x27;s consternation that the vast sums the Beatles paid in tax were being used to fund the manufacture of military weapons. Harrison voiced this concern in his &quot;How a Beatle Lives&quot; interview with Maureen Cleave of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, in late February, in addition to railing against all forms of authority and speaking out against the Vietnam War. He likened Wilson to the Robin Hood character the Sheriff of Nottingham.

The song includes references to &quot;Mr Wilson&quot; and &quot;Mr Heath&quot;, the latter being Ted Heath, the leader of the Conservative Party. In June 1965, during his first term as prime minister, Wilson had nominated the four Beatles as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBEs). An unprecedented award for pop musicians, the MBEs recognised the group&#x27;s sizeable contribution to the national economy, as their international breakthrough in 1964 created an export market for British pop for the first time. The band&#x27;s international success also benefited the country&#x27;s tourism and fashion industries, and entertainment generally; the surge in exports revenue extended to film and other commercial artistic pursuits, and by early 1966, recognition of London as the &quot;Swinging City&quot; of international culture. According to author Ian MacDonald in his discussion of &quot;Taxman&quot;, the substantial tax the Beatles paid to Britain&#x27;s Treasury was the &quot;price&quot; they paid for their MBEs.

==Recording==
The Beatles had hoped to record their &quot;Revolver&quot; album in a more modern facility than EMI&#x27;s London studios at Abbey Road and were especially impressed with the sound on records created at Stax Studio in Memphis. Brian Epstein, the band&#x27;s manager, investigated the possibility of recording at Stax, but the idea was abandoned after locals began descending on the Stax building, as were alternative plans to use either Atlantic Studios in New York or Motown&#x27;s Hitsville USA facility in Detroit. McCartney later said that only &quot;Taxman&quot; and his own soul-inspired &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; might have sounded better recorded in an American studio, but otherwise, the Beatles &quot;found a new British sound almost by accident&quot; on &quot;Revolver&quot;.

The Beatles began recording &quot;Taxman&quot; on 20 April, but the results were left unused. Ten new takes were taped on 21 April, the four tracks being filled with Ringo Starr&#x27;s drums and McCartney&#x27;s bass and Harrison&#x27;s distorted rhythm guitar, followed by overdubs of McCartney&#x27;s lead guitar, Harrison&#x27;s lead vocal, and Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s backing vocals. Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes that although EMI engineer Geoff Emerick provided a withering account of Harrison&#x27;s initial efforts to work out a solo, this was more reflective of Emerick&#x27;s personality and is not borne out in McCartney and Harrison&#x27;s recollections. McCartney said that he was discussing his idea for the solo with Harrison, and Harrison invited him to play it on the recording. Harrison said he was happy to have the song recorded for &quot;Revolver&quot; and was not fussed about who played the guitar solo. He added: &quot;I was pleased to have him play that bit on &#x27;Taxman&#x27;. If you notice, he did like a little Indian bit on it for me.&quot;

The chanted names of Wilson and Heath replaced two rapidly sung refrains of &quot;Anybody got a bit of money?&quot; heard in take 11 of the song. The intro – a spoken &quot;One, two, three, four&quot; – was added during an overdubbing and mixing session on 16 May. The song&#x27;s ending was created on 21 June. This consisted of the section containing the guitar solo being spliced onto the end of the recording, replacing a formal ending after Harrison&#x27;s final vocal line, and continuing into a fadeout.

==Composition==

The song is in the key of D major and in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack/Notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The recording begins before the actual song with coughing and counting (pointedly cut short, as the real count being heard in the background). The counting is delivered by Harrison in a &quot;grim, miserly voice&quot;, according to Beatles biographer Jonathan Gould, and contrasts with a traditional count-in before a live performance. Gould sees &quot;subtle self-mockery&quot; in this gesture, since it reflects how, in the space of three years, the Beatles&#x27; focus had moved &quot;from the dance floor to the counting house&quot;. Author Steve Turner describes &quot;Taxman&quot; as a &quot;smart little pop art song&quot; due to the references to Wilson and Heath and its drawing musical inspiration from Neil Hefti&#x27;s &quot;Batman Theme&quot;, from the 1966 television series &quot;Batman&quot;.

The chords stress the 7 scale degree (C-natural in the key of D major) and frequently involve a major/minor I chord (D/Dm) in the harmony, which consequently evokes either Mixolydian or Dorian modes. There is one III (F chord) near the end, but unusually no V (A) chord. According to musicologist Dominic Pedler, the composition is also notable for its use of both a 5th-string voicing of the dominant seventh sharp ninth chord to embellish the tonic D7 chord at the end of each two-line verse (at 0:12 and 0:19), and a 6th-string form to create a complementary &quot;jarring dissonance&quot; with the lyrics in the subdominant (IV) G chord (to a G79) at 1:29 (after the solo) on &quot;&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m the taxman, yeah – I&#x27;m &quot;the taxman&quot;&quot;. Gould sees the band&#x27;s exclamation of the word &quot;Taxman!&quot; before the solo as accentuating the comic comparison between the tax collector as a &quot;civil servant superhero&quot; and the DC Comics character Batman.

McCartney&#x27;s bass line has been considered to imitate Motown bassist James Jamerson in its active lines and glissandi (at 0:55–1:08). In the third verse McCartney doubles his own pentatonic bass line while outlining the jarring Iflat7 chord in octaves (at 1:32–1:44).

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has described the completed track as &quot;skeleton funk – Harrison&#x27;s choppy fuzz-toned guitar chords moving against an R&amp;B dance beat&quot;, with McCartney contributing a &quot;screeching-raga guitar solo&quot;. The solo uses what musicologist Alan Pollack describes as &quot;fast triplets, exotic modal touches, and a melodic shape which traverses several octaves and ends with a breathtaking upward flourish&quot;. Walter Everett considers that the solo is in the same Dorian mode that Harrison had recently adapted for his sitar part in &quot;Love You To&quot;.

MacDonald writes that &quot;Taxman&quot; suggests the rhythmic influence of contemporaneous hit singles by James Brown, Lee Dorsey and the Spencer Davis Group, while music journalist Rob Chapman views Harrison&#x27;s guitar riff as similarly American R&amp;B-derived, citing also the Stax Records band Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. According to MacDonald, McCartney&#x27;s solo &quot;goes far beyond anything in the Indian style Harrison had done on guitar, the probable inspiration being Jeff Beck&#x27;s ground-breaking solo on the Yardbirds&#x27; &#x27;Shapes of Things&#x27;&quot;. McCartney recalled that he approached the part wanting to add something &quot;feedback-y and crazy&quot; and likened its style and attitude to early-period Jimi Hendrix.

==Release==
EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label released &quot;Revolver&quot; on 5 August 1966, with &quot;Taxman&quot; sequenced as the opening track, before &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. According to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, having an unprecedented three compositions on a Beatles album – &quot;Taxman&quot;, the fully Indian-styled &quot;Love You To&quot;, and &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; – established Harrison as a third &quot;prolific&quot; songwriter within the band. Music critic Tim Riley states that in Harrison&#x27;s off-tempo delivery and sneer, the spoken count-in on &quot;Taxman&quot; announced the &quot;new studio aesthetic of &quot;Revolver&quot;&quot;. He views this as a contrast with the shouted &quot;One, two, three, four!&quot; that introduced the band&#x27;s &quot;live sound&quot; on &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; in 1963, at the start of their debut album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;.

&quot;Taxman&quot; was the Beatles&#x27; first topical song and the first political statement they had made in their music. Music historian David Simonelli, in his book &quot;Working Class Heroes&quot;, groups it with &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; and the band&#x27;s May 1966 single tracks &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; as examples of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;pointed social commentary&quot; that consolidated their &quot;dominance of London&#x27;s social scene&quot;. He likens this aspect to the Rolling Stones&#x27; development at this time, whereby a group&#x27;s songs &quot;had to comment on the values that marked affluence in Britain&quot;. In a 1968 interview, Lennon referenced &quot;Taxman&quot; as part of the Beatles&#x27; anti-authoritarian outlook; he said it was an &quot;anti-establishment tax song&quot; and that the band still protested against having to pay the government unless it was for a &quot;communal or Communist or real Christian society&quot;. He was taken aback when the Dutch interviewer, Abram de Swaan, criticised the song&#x27;s message and insisted that taxes should be high to benefit the whole of society.

The omission of &quot;Taxman&quot;, along with any other Harrison-written track, was one of the main complaints that fans levelled against the Beatles&#x27; 1973 double LP &quot;1962–1966&quot;, released three years after the group&#x27;s break-up. In 1976, following the expiration of the band&#x27;s contract with EMI/Capitol, &quot;Taxman&quot; was included on Capitol&#x27;s themed Beatles compilation &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;. Later that year, Capitol – ignoring Harrison&#x27;s wishes that none of his Beatles-era songs appear – also included it on &quot;The Best of George Harrison&quot;.

When Harrison published his autobiography in 1980, Lennon was deeply hurt by the minimal coverage afforded him in the book. Responding to this in a 1987 interview, Harrison said: &quot;He was annoyed &#x27;cos I didn&#x27;t say he&#x27;d written one line of the song &#x27;Taxman&#x27;. But I also didn&#x27;t say how I wrote two lines of &#x27;Come Together&#x27; or three lines of &#x27;Eleanor Rigby&#x27;, you know – I wasn&#x27;t getting into any of that.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Richard Goldstein described &quot;Revolver&quot; as &quot;revolutionary&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;great leap forward&quot;, and highlighted &quot;Taxman&quot; as &quot;the album&#x27;s example of political cheek, in which George enumerates Britain&#x27;s current economic woes&quot;. He added that by naming both Wilson and Heath as &quot;the villains&quot;, the Beatles &quot;lay it right on the non-partisan line&quot;. In their joint album review in &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Richard Green characterised the track as &quot;Big beat rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, adding, &quot;I liked it. Good idea&quot;, while Peter Jones found it &quot;[a] bit repetitive&quot; but &quot;Loved the wild, strident guitar mid-way&quot;. &quot;KRLA Beat&quot;″s reviewer said it was &quot;One of the best and most commercial George Harrison compositions for some time&quot;, adding: &quot;It is also one of the best, most concise satirical comments on British society and the current tax situation (not to mention our own!) to come along from &quot;anyone&quot; for some time.&quot; Paul Williams of &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; found it succeeded as a humorous song unlike &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; but that the Indian-style instrumental break was &quot;out of place&quot; unlike on &quot;Love You To&quot;. He said that lines such as &quot;Ha-ha, Mr Wilson&quot; were &quot;delightful&quot; and dubbed the song &quot;Batman goes protest&quot;.

Ian MacDonald writes that, while Harrison was &quot;rightly praised&quot; for his composition, &quot;Taxman&quot; benefited from the whole group&#x27;s creativity. He highlights McCartney&#x27;s bass part as &quot;remarkable&quot; and his guitar solo as &quot;outstanding&quot;. Alex Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; considers it &quot;faintly mind-boggling&quot; that the Beatles departed from their usual approach to album tracks by issuing &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; as a single from &quot;Revolver&quot;, saying that &quot;Taxman&quot; was one of the songs that would have been more worthy.

&quot;Taxman&quot; was ranked 48th in &quot;Mojo&quot;″s list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;, compiled in 2006 by a panel of critics and musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojo/101 Greatest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary for the magazine, singer Joe Brown cited the track as a &quot;brilliant example&quot; of how, just as Harrison&#x27;s guitar playing was often crucial in Lennon–McCartney compositions, he was never selfish in his musicianship but was instead motivated to &quot;get the best for the song&quot; each time. Brown added: &quot;everyone [is] chipping in with guitar parts and harmonies... There&#x27;s no fat at all on it. And, [it&#x27;s] very funny.&quot; On a similar list compiled by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2010, the song appeared at number 55, where the editors described it as &quot;a crucial link between the guitar-driven clang of the Beatles&#x27; 1963–65 sound and the emerging splendor of the group&#x27;s experiments in psychedelia&quot;. In 2018, the music staff of &quot;Time Out London&quot; ranked &quot;Taxman&quot; at number seven on their list of the best Beatles songs.

In 2015, the editors of &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Taxman&quot; at number three in their list of &quot;The Beatles&#x27; 50 Greatest Guitar Moments&quot;. They praised the solo as &quot;a stunningly sophisticated creation, drawn from an Indian-derived Dorian mode and featuring descending pull-offs that recall Jeff Beck&#x27;s work on the Yardbirds&#x27; &#x27;Shapes of Things&#x27;&quot; and said that while McCartney had played lead guitar on some previous Beatles tracks, &quot;Taxman&quot; was when he &quot;[came] into his own as a guitarist&quot;. In 2001, when VH1 chose &quot;Revolver&quot; as its all-time greatest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album, &quot;Taxman&quot; was among the four tracks, along with &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, cited by Bill Flanagan to support the contention that &quot;If pop music were destroyed tomorrow, we could re-create it from this album alone.&quot;

==Legacy==
In his book &quot;Psychedelia and Other Colours&quot;, Rob Chapman highlights &quot;Taxman&quot; as an example of the Beatles&#x27; widespread influence on rock music&#x27;s developments during the 1960s. He says that Harrison&#x27;s guitar riff &quot;runs like an unbroken thread through the development of English psychedelia&quot; and is also present &quot;as a trace element in many a mod-pop mutation&quot;. Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Harrison commemorative book, in January 2002, Mikal Gilmore recognised his incorporation of dissonance in the melody to &quot;Taxman&quot; and &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; as having been &quot;revolutionary in popular music&quot; in 1966. Gilmore considered this quality to be &quot;perhaps more originally creative&quot; than the avant-garde styling that Lennon and McCartney took from Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgar Varese and Igor Stravinsky and brought to the Beatles&#x27; work over the same period. &quot;Revolver&quot; has been recognised as having inspired new subgenres of music, anticipating punk rock in the case of &quot;Taxman&quot;.
During the 1996 US presidential election, publicity for Republican candidate Bob Dole stated that he would be using a tape of &quot;Taxman&quot; in his campaign rallies. This was in response to his Democratic opponent, Bill Clinton, adopting a personal anecdote from his past as a student in England, detailing how he defended Starr in a Liverpool pub brawl, as part of his campaign rhetoric. In early 2002, according to musicologist Russell Reising, &quot;one of the largest [tax] preparation companies in the United States&quot; used a version of &quot;Taxman&quot; in their television commercials. In 2006, Virginia State Senator and future Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli introduced an amendment to make &quot;Taxman&quot; the state song of Virginia, stating that taxes were an important part of Virginia history. He gave the example of Patrick Henry&#x27;s strong opposition to British taxation during the American Revolution. The measure did not pass.

&quot;Quartz&quot; reporter Aamna Mohdin describes &quot;Taxman&quot; as &quot;the mother of all tax protest songs&quot; amid a wealth of creative works that convey &quot;the misery of taxes&quot;. A 2019 article in &quot;Tax Journal&quot; stated that the Beatles&#x27; legacy endures in the &quot;world of tax&quot; through the song, which had become the &quot;karaoke favourite&quot; of Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs, and through &quot;the &#x27;Beatles clause&#x27; – a targeted anti-avoidance rule aimed at preventing entertainers from converting highly taxed income to lower-tax capital receipts&quot;. While debating the merits of reintroducing supertax in the UK, the writers warned against a return to the level imposed by Wilson, which they said, in support of Harrison&#x27;s contention, &quot;wasn&#x27;t a fair progressive system. It was outright theft.&quot; Cultural commentator Christopher Bray finds &quot;Taxman&quot; highly amusing and describes Harrison as &quot;one of the Sixties&#x27; greatest poets of sybaritic hedonism&quot;. However, he cites the song, along with the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;, as reflective of how the generation that had benefited from the implementation of postwar welfare policies and Keynesian economics in Britain were too quick to take them for granted by 1965, an approach he sees as enabling Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;neo-liberal revolution&quot; of the 1980s. On 14 October 2022, a music video for the song directed by Danny Sangra was released on the band&#x27;s official YouTube channel to promote the deluxe edition of Revolver.

==Other versions, tributes and parodies==
The Beatles chose not to perform any of the songs from &quot;Revolver&quot; in concert, and Harrison first played &quot;Taxman&quot; live on his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton. He took to introducing it as &quot;a very old song written in 1873&quot;. In other comments at that time, he said its message was relevant &quot;regardless if it&#x27;s the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties, [or] Nineties&quot;, since &quot;There&#x27;s always a taxman.&quot; Harrison changed much of the lyric, updating the politicians to John Major, George Bush and Boris Yeltsin, making reference to VAT, and including a new bridge that ended with the lines &quot;If you wipe your feet, I&#x27;ll tax the mat / If you&#x27;re overweight, I&#x27;ll tax your fat.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Taxman&quot; was covered by the 1960s garage-psychedelic band the Music Machine in a version that music critic Richie Unterberger describes as &quot;[sticking] pretty close to the original arrangement&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while a recording by Junior Parker fully explored the song&#x27;s soul traits. Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham includes a version by avant-garde cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm in his selection of &quot;bizarre Beatles covers&quot;. Recorded in 1992 at the Knitting Factory nightclub in New York, the five-minute track contains &quot;fiery&quot; improvisation, according to Ingham, who deems it a &quot;witty, intense, unsettling&quot; interpretation.

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers played &quot;Taxman&quot; in tribute to Harrison at the Concert for George, held at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in November 2002. On the 2003 &quot;Songs from the Material World&quot; Harrison tribute album, former Rolling Stone Bill Wyman contributed a version that Johnny Loftus of AllMusic views as &quot;effective, if not particularly memorable&quot;.

Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;Taxman, Mr Thief&quot;, from their 1977 eponymous debut album, is an homage to the Beatles&#x27; song, dealing in similar lyrical themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohdin/Quartz&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Jam adapted the riff and rhythm from &quot;Taxman&quot; in their 1980 hit single &quot;Start!&quot; BBC music critic Chris Jones describes it as &quot;&#x27;Taxman&#x27; in all but name, but done so wonderfully as to negate any gripes&quot;. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; similarly writes that the Jam &quot;hijacked&quot; the original recording&#x27;s key &quot;eccentric force ... in Harrison&#x27;s hydraulic-R&amp;B rhythm guitar&quot;, but did so &quot;with love&quot;.

&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic recorded a parody of &quot;Taxman&quot; in late 1981, during the height of the Pac-Man game&#x27;s popularity. Titled &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, it was first released on the 2017 compilation &quot;Squeeze Box: The Complete Works of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot;. Beatallica&#x27;s 2004 track &quot;Sandman&quot; parodies &quot;Taxman&quot; and the Metallica song &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;.

<text>Tracy Jo Pollan Fox (born June 22, 1960) is an American actress and author. She is known for playing Ellen Reed on the NBC sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; (1985–1987) and Harper Anderson on the crime drama series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2000), for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. 

Pollan married actor and activist Michael J. Fox in 1988, and has since occasionally acted. In film, she has starred in the dramas &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot; (1983) and &quot;Promised Land&quot; (1987), the tragedy &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (1988) and the crime drama &quot;A Stranger Among Us&quot; (1992). Her other television credits include two episodes of &quot;Spin City&quot; (1997–1998) and TV films such as &quot;First to Die&quot; (2003), &quot;Natalee Holloway&quot; (2009) and &quot;Justice for Natalee Holloway&quot; (2011).

== Early life ==
Pollan was born to a Jewish family on June 22, 1960 on Long Island. Her parents are Corky and Stephen Pollan, and she has a brother, Michael. She attended Syosset High School, and graduated from the Dalton School in Manhattan, New York. She studied acting at the Herbert Berghof Studio and the Lee Strasberg Institute.

== Personal life ==

Pollan met Michael J. Fox while working on &quot;Family Ties&quot;, and after beginning a relationship during the production of &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, they married on July 16, 1988. She then lessened her acting workload to focus on her marriage and family. They have four children together: a son, Sam; twin daughters, Aquinnah Kathleen and Schuyler Frances; and a daughter, Esmé Annabelle. They reside in Manhattan. On June 22, 2024 (Pollan&#x27;s 64th birthday), Schuyler married her longtime partner at Hayfield in the Catskill Mountains.

== Publications ==
In October 2014, Pollan, along with her two sisters and mother, co-authored &quot;The Pollan Family Table&quot;, a cookbook of family recipes, kitchen tips and cooking techniques. The foreword was written by her brother, Michael.

In 2019, Pollan co-authored a plant-based diet cookbook, &quot;Mostly Plants: 101 Delicious Flexitarian Recipes from the Pollan Family&quot;.

<doc id="847094" wikidata="Q1336472" url="?curid=847094" title="Joseph Paul Franklin">
<text>Joseph Paul Franklin (born James Clayton Vaughn Jr.; April 13, 1950 – November 20, 2013) was an American serial killer, white supremacist, and domestic terrorist who engaged in a murder spree spanning the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Franklin was convicted of several murders and received seven life sentences, as well as one death sentence. He also confessed to the attempted murders of magazine publisher and pornographer Larry Flynt in 1978 and civil rights activist Vernon Jordan in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those highly publicized cases, and he made his confessions years after the crimes had occurred.

Franklin was on Missouri&#x27;s death row for 15 years awaiting execution for the 1977 murder of Gerald Gordon. He was executed by lethal injection on November 20, 2013.

==Early life==
James Clayton Vaughn Jr. was born in Mobile, Alabama, on April 13, 1950, the elder son of James Clayton Vaughn Sr. and Helen Rau Vaughn. He had two sisters and a brother. Vaughn&#x27;s father was a World War II veteran and butcher who left the family when Vaughn was aged eight. His sister Carolyn recalled, &quot;Whenever [Vaughn Sr.] came to visit he&#x27;d beat us,&quot; and their mother had Vaughn Sr. jailed twice for public drunkenness. Vaughn&#x27;s mother was described by a family friend as &quot;a full-blooded German, a real strict, perfectionist lady. I never saw her beat any of [her children], but they told me stories.&quot;

Vaughn later stated that he was rarely given enough to eat and suffered severe physical abuse as a child, and that his mother &quot;didn&#x27;t care about [him and his siblings]&quot;. He claimed that these factors stunted his emotional development, and said he had &quot;always been [at] least ten years or more behind other people in their maturity.&quot;

As early as high school, Vaughn developed an interest in evangelical Christianity, then in Nazism, and later held memberships in both the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party and the Ku Klux Klan. He eventually changed his name to &quot;Joseph Paul Franklin&quot; in honor of Paul Joseph Goebbels and Benjamin Franklin. In the 1960s, Franklin was inspired to start a race war after reading Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve never felt that way about any other book that I read,&quot; he later reflected. &quot;It was something weird about that book.&quot;

In the early 1970s, he took a road trip to an American Nazi Party conference in Virginia with David Duke (then a student) and Don Black.

==Crimes==
For much of his life, Franklin was a drifter, roaming the East Coast seeking chances to &quot;cleanse the world&quot; of people he considered inferior, especially black and Jewish people. His primary source of financial support appears to have been bank robberies. Franklin supplemented his income from criminal acts with paid blood bank donations, which eventually led to his subsequent capture by the FBI.

===1977===
* July 29, 1977: Franklin firebombed Beth Shalom Synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee, destroying it. Loss of life was prevented because some of the worshippers left early that Friday evening and as a result, there were not enough worshippers for a minyan.
* August 7, 1977: Franklin shot and killed a young interracial couple, Alphonse Manning Jr. and Toni Schwenn, in a parking lot at East Towne Mall in Madison, Wisconsin. He was later convicted of both murders and was sentenced to life in prison.
* October 8, 1977: In suburban St. Louis, Missouri, Franklin hid in the bushes near Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue and fired on a group attending services. In this incident, Franklin killed 42-year-old Gerald Gordon. He also wounded Steven Goldman and William Ash.

===1978===
*March 6, 1978: Franklin, according to his later account, used a Ruger .44 caliber semi-automatic rifle to ambush &quot;Hustler&quot; publisher Larry Flynt and his lawyer Gene Reeves in Lawrenceville, Georgia. In his confession, Franklin said this was in retaliation for an edition of &quot;Hustler&quot; displaying interracial sex. Neither Franklin nor anyone else was ever charged in that shooting.
*July 29, 1978: Franklin hid near a Pizza Hut in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and shot and killed William Bryant Tatum, a black man, with a 12-gauge shotgun; he also shot Tatum&#x27;s white girlfriend, Nancy Hilton, who survived. Franklin later confessed and pleaded guilty. He was given a life sentence, as well as a sentence for an unrelated armed robbery in 1977.

===1979===
*July 12, 1979: Taco Bell manager Harold McIver, a black man, was fatally shot through a window from in Doraville, Georgia. Franklin confessed but was not tried or sentenced for this crime. Franklin said that McIver was in close contact with white women, so he murdered him.
*October 21, 1979: Franklin killed Jesse E. Taylor, a black man, and his white wife, Marion Bresette, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

===1980===
*May 29, 1980: Franklin confessed to shooting and seriously wounding civil rights activist and Urban League president Vernon Jordan after seeing him with a white woman in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Franklin initially denied any part in the crime and was acquitted, but later confessed.
*June 8, 1980: Franklin killed cousins Darrell Lane (14) and Dante Evans Brown (13) in Cincinnati, Ohio. Waiting on an overpass to shoot a racially mixed couple, he shot the boys instead, a crime to which he later confessed. He was convicted in 1998 and received two life sentences for these murders.
*June 15, 1980: Franklin shot and killed Arthur Smothers (22) and Kathleen Mikula (16) with a high-powered rifle as the couple walked across the Washington Street Bridge in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Smothers was black; Mikula was white. On the day of the murder, Franklin took a concealed position on a wooded hillside overlooking downtown Johnstown and waited for potential targets to enter his line of sight. He was never arrested for these murders, but he confessed to them during a jailhouse interview after he was apprehended.
*June 25, 1980: Franklin used a .44 Ruger pistol to kill two hitchhikers, Nancy Santomero (19) and Vicki Durian (26), in Pocahontas County, West Virginia. He confessed to the crime in 1997 to an Ohio assistant prosecutor in the course of investigation in another case. He said he picked up the white women and decided to kill them after one said she had a black boyfriend. Jacob Beard of Florida was convicted and imprisoned in 1993 on these charges. He was freed in 1999 and a new trial was ordered based on Franklin&#x27;s confession.
*August 20, 1980: Franklin killed two black men, Ted Fields and David Martin, near Liberty Park located in Salt Lake City, Utah. He was tried on federal civil rights charges as well as state first-degree murder charges. He was convicted of both murders and was sentenced to life in prison.

==Apprehension, conviction, and imprisonment==
Following the two murders in Utah, Franklin returned to the midwestern U.S. Traveling through Kentucky, he was detained and questioned regarding a firearm that he was transporting in his car. Franklin fled from this interrogation, but authorities recovered sufficient evidence from his vehicle to potentially link him to the sniper killings. His conspicuous racist tattoos, coupled with his habit of visiting blood banks, led investigators to issue a nationwide alert to blood banks. In October 1980, the tattoos drew the attention of a Florida blood bank worker, who contacted the FBI. Franklin was arrested in Lakeland on October 28, 1980.

Franklin faced legal action across the U.S. for the next two decades, eventually being convicted of multiple murders, attacks, and other crimes at both the state and federal levels. He was sentenced to life in prison and received the death penalty in several states. 

Franklin tried unsuccessfully to escape during the judgment phase of his 1997 Missouri trial on charges of murdering Gerald Gordon but was ultimately convicted. Psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis, who had interviewed him at length, testified for the defense that she believed that he was a paranoid schizophrenic and unfit to stand trial. Lewis noted his delusional thinking and a childhood history of severe abuse.

In October 2013, victim Larry Flynt called for clemency for Franklin, asserting &quot;that a government that forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of killing people itself.&quot;

Franklin was held on death row at the Potosi Correctional Center near Mineral Point, Missouri. In August 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court announced that Franklin would be executed on November 20. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said in a statement that by setting execution dates, the state high court &quot;has taken an important step to see that justice is finally done for the victims and their families.&quot;

==Execution==
Franklin&#x27;s execution was affected by the European Union export ban when the German drug manufacturer Fresenius Kabi was obliged to refuse having their drugs used for lethal injections. In response, Missouri announced that it would use for Franklin&#x27;s execution a new method of lethal injection, which used a single drug provided by an unnamed compounding pharmacy.

A day before his execution, U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey (Jefferson City) granted a stay of execution over concerns raised about the new method of execution. A second stay was granted that evening by US District Judge Carol E. Jackson (St. Louis), based on Franklin&#x27;s claim that he was too mentally incompetent to be executed. An appeals court quickly overturned both stays, and the Supreme Court subsequently rejected his final appeals.

In an interview with the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; newspaper published on November 17, 2013, Franklin said he had renounced his racist views. He said his motivation had been &quot;illogical&quot; and was partly a consequence of an abusive upbringing. He said he had interacted with black people in prison, adding: &quot;I saw they were people just like us.&quot;

Franklin was executed at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri, on November 20, 2013. The execution began at 6:07 a.m. CST and he was pronounced dead at 6:17 a.m. His execution was the first lethal injection in Missouri to use pentobarbital alone instead of the conventional use of three drugs. 
An Associated Press agency report said that of the barbiturate pentobarbital was administered.

Three media witnesses said Franklin did not seem to show pain. He did not make any final written statement and did not speak a word in the death chamber. After the injection, he blinked a few times, breathed heavily a few times, and swallowed hard, the witnesses said. The heaving of his chest slowed, and finally stopped, they said.

==Representation in other media==
&quot;Hunter&quot; (1989), a novel by the white supremacist William L. Pierce, revolves around protagonist Oscar Yeager, a racist serial killer who murders interracial couples. Pierce, founder of the National Alliance and author of a similarly themed novel, &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;, dedicated the book to Joseph Paul Franklin, and said of Franklin that &quot;he saw his duty as a white man and did what a responsible son of his race must do.&quot; In the 1996 film &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, Franklin was portrayed by Czech actor Jan Tříska. In 2009, Franklin appeared in the MSNBC TV series &quot;Criminal Mindscape&quot;.

<text>Webley &amp; Scott is an arms manufacturer founded in Birmingham, England. Webley produced handguns and long guns from 1834 to 1979, when the company ceased to manufacture firearms and instead turned its attention to producing air pistols and air rifles. In 2010 Webley &amp; Scott restarted the production of shotguns for commercial sale.

Webley is famous for the revolvers and automatic pistols it supplied to the British Empire&#x27;s military, particularly the British Army, from 1887 through both World War I and World War II.

==History==

The Webley company was founded in the late 18th century by William Davies, who made bullet moulds. It was taken over in 1834 by his son-in-law, Philip Webley, who began producing percussion sporting guns. The manufacture of revolvers, for which the firm became famous, began twenty years later. Their first percussion revolver, Webley Longspur, entered production in 1853. Due heavy competition from Colt&#x27;s and Adams revolvers at the time, sales of the early Webley revolvers was only modest. At that time the company was named P. Webley &amp; Son. In 1897, Webley amalgamated with W &amp; C Scott and Sons to become The Webley &amp; Scott Revolver and Arms Company Ltd of Birmingham.

Webley&#x27;s revolvers became the official British sidearm in 1887, remaining in British service until 1964. After 1921 Webley service revolvers were manufactured by the government-owned Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield.

In 1932 the Enfield No.2 .38 inch calibre revolver, became the standard British service revolver. However, wartime shortages ensured that all marks of the Webley, including models in .455 and .38/200, remained in use through World War Two. The .455 Mk.VI was declared obsolete in 1945 but the .38 Mk.IV remained in service as a substitute standard weapon into the early 1960s.

In 1920, the passing of the Firearms Act in the UK, which limited the availability of handguns to civilians, caused their sales to plummet. The company adapted by producing pneumatic guns, their first being the Mark I air pistol.

Demand for air guns increased rapidly in the 1920s and Webley&#x27;s business began to grow again, with an inevitable peak related to weapons supply for British military use during the Second World War. Declining sales led to the decision to give up firearms manufacture completely in 1979, however air gun production at the Birmingham factory continued until 22 December 2005, when the company closed down. Webley&#x27;s dependent company - Venom Custom Shop - ceased trading as well. It was then bought by Wolverhampton-based company Airgunsport. At this time Airgunsport relocated the manufacture of all Webley guns to Turkey.

Webley &amp; Scott Ltd is owned by both the Fuller Group and John Bright. John Bright is also co-owner of Highland Outdoors Limited who are the UK distributors for Webley, Webley &amp; Scott and AGS.

==Production==

Until 1979 Webley &amp; Scott manufactured shotguns and revolvers for private use, as well as producing sidearms for military and police use. This came to include both revolvers and self-loading (semi-automatic) pistols.

Webley&#x27;s production originally consisted of hand-crafted firearms, although mass-production was later introduced to supply police and military buyers.

The first Webley production revolver appeared in 1853. Known as the Longspur it was a muzzle-loaded percussion cap and ball pistol. Some consider it to be the finest revolver of its day as it could shoot as fast as the contemporary Colt revolvers and was faster to load. However the hand-made Longspur could not compete in price with mass-produced revolvers such as the Colt, and production never equalled that of Webley&#x27;s competitors Adams (Deane, Adams &amp; Deane) or Tranter.

Webley&#x27;s first popular success came with its first double-action revolver, adopted by the Royal Irish Constabulary in 1867. There is a well-known story that a pair of Webley RIC Model revolvers were presented to Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer by Lord Berkeley in 1869, and it is believed that General Custer was using them at the time of his death in the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

There is some question whether the gun or guns presented to George Armstrong Custer were Webley RIC&#x27;s. 
Other sources indicate that Lord Berkeley Paget presented Custer with a Galand &amp; Sommerville 44 calibre revolver (manufactured in England by the firm of Braendlin &amp; Sommerville) and gave another to Tom Custer. Of course, it is possible that Lord Berkeley Paget may have given Custer two revolvers, both a Galand &amp; Sommerville and a Webley RIC or even given the Custer brothers, in some combination, a pair of Webley RICs and a pair of Galand &amp; Sommervilles. A cased Galand &amp; Sommerville revolver certainly formed part of Tom Custer&#x27;s estate. Galand &amp; Sommerville 44 revolvers were made to use the same ammunition as the first Webley RIC&#x27;s, i.e. Webley&#x27;s .442 centre-fire cartridge.

Almost all of Webley&#x27;s subsequent revolvers were of a top-break design. A pivoting lever on the side of the gun&#x27;s upper receiver was pressed to release the barrel and cylinder assembly, which then tilts up and forward on a bottom-front pivot. After loading, the assembly is tilted back into firing position and locked closed. 

Webley went on to produce more revolvers for the civilian market. Webley&#x27;s popular pocket revolver, The British Bull Dog, was developed in 1872, available in .44 Short Rimfire, .442 and .450 calibers, and widely exported and copied. Smaller scale versions in .320 and .380 calibers were added later.

Although often attributed to Webley, Webley only produced some of the revolvers now commonly referred to as Webley .577 Boxer Revolvers, which used the most powerful handgun cartridge of the day, the .577 Boxer. It was produced by Webley under licence from the firm of William Tranter of Birmingham, whose design it actually was. Webley was just one of several firms licensed to use Tranter&#x27;s double-action lock and particularly Tranter&#x27;s patented revolving recoil shield, which was a key feature of the early .577 calibre revolvers.

In 1879 Webley developed &amp; sold commercially a rugged and powerful revolver intended for the British military, the WG or Webley Government in .455/.476, the WG&#x27;s cylinder was long enough for .44 Russian &amp; .45 Colt length rounds [Jim Farmer has seen .45 Colt chambered WG models, but is unsure if they were converted .455s- further research is needed for WG chamberings- he has seen Belgian WG copies made in .44-40]. The WG frame &amp; cylinder were then shortened for the .455 &amp; the variant was adopted in the 1880s as the Webley Mk 1. Nicknamed &quot;the British Peacemaker&quot; in the United States, the Mk 1 was manufactured in .450, .455 Webley, and .476 calibre and founded a family of revolvers that were the standard handguns of the British Army, Royal Navy, and British police constabularies from 1887 to 1918. The Mark VI (known as the Webley Revolver No. 1 Mark VI after 1927) was the last standard service pistol made by Webley; the most widely produced of their revolvers, 300,000 were made for service during World War I.
Webley began experimenting with semi-automatic action in 1900 and in 1909 they began producing a series of semi-automatic pistols for civilian and police use. Their .32 Automatic Pistol was adopted by London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police in 1911. The same weapon in .38 calibre was used by the Royal Navy as a substitute standard weapon during World War II. The Ordnance Factory Board of India still manufactures .380 Revolver Mk IIz cartridges, as well as a .32 caliber revolver (also known as IOF Mk1) with barrel that is clearly based on the Webley Mk IV .38 service pistol.

In 1924 Webley produced its first air pistol, the Mark I.

In 1929 Webley introduced its Mark II air rifle. During World War II Webley air rifles were used for rifle training as well as civilian target shooting and hunting.

The Mark II, known as the service air rifle because of its use by the UK military, used break-action with a superimposed barrel locked by bolt action. The detachable barrel was easily interchangeable with others of the three calibres available.

The Mark II was discontinued in 1946 and replaced by the Mark III, in production until 1975. The Mark III was a top-loaded air rifle with a fixed barrel and used underlever cocking. It was only made in .177 and .22 calibres.
Webley continues to manufacture air pistols in .22 (5.5 mm) and .177 (4.5 mm) calibre, and air rifles in .22, .177 and .25 (6.35 mm) calibre. A variety of actions were/are available in several different models, including the Hurricane, Nemesis, Stinger and Tempest air pistols and Raider, Venom, and Vulcan air rifles. In early 2007 Webley broke away from its traditional &#x27;barrel overlever&#x27; design to launch the revised Typhoon model, a &#x27;break-barrel&#x27; design with a recoil-reduction system.

Webley &amp; Scott has also returned to shotgun production with alliances with European manufacturers, and now markets a number of sporting and competition shotguns.

In 2008, Webley sold to Webley (International) Limited but still produces products under the Webley name.

In January 2011 Webley (international) Limited held a creditors meeting Under Section 98 Insolvency Act 1986. On 3 February 2011 liquidators were appointed to wind up the affairs of the company.

According to the Statement of Affairs produced by the Liquidators, Webley (international) owed their unsecured creditors a sum of £164,595.76. They also owed money to one Secured Creditor, Webley Limited (in Liquidation) a sum of £140,000.

Webley &amp; Scott was acquired by the Fuller Group in 2012.

In 2016, Webley &amp; Scott launch the 1000 Series and 950 Series shotguns.
The Xocet Rimfire Rifle is also launched.

==Webley &amp; Scott automatic pistols==
Webley&#x27;s first autoloading pistol was an experimental pistol in .45 calibre produced in 1903; mass production began in 1906 with the .32 ACP (7.65 mm) model. This pistol had a 3.5&quot; barrel and an 8-round magazine. A .25 (6.35 mm) version had a 3-inch barrel and a 6-round magazine. Ultimately pistols were produced in a range of bores from .22 inch to .455 inch, and included 9 mm models. Webley self-loaders were simple, single-action blowback pistols, designed by William Whiting. Production ceased in 1940.

In 1905, Webley had presented an auto-loading pistol for testing by the Small Arms Committee (SAC), a British military group charged with organizing trials and making recommendations of arms to the War Office. The SAC, which had begun testing automatics in 1900, was unimpressed by Webley&#x27;s offering, preferring foreign automatics including the Colt. However no automatic was recommended over contemporary service revolvers, which were all Webleys at the time, and trials would continue until 1913.

In 1910 Webley offered a new automatic for testing, and in 1911 the Webley self-loading .455-inch Mark I was recommended by both the SAC and the Chief Inspector of Small Arms (CISA.) This pistol was adopted by the Royal Navy in early 1912 as the first automatic pistol officially in British service. Later the pistol was also adopted by the Royal Horse Artillery and was issued to members of the Royal Flying Corps.

The Webley &amp; Scott self-loading .455 inch pistol had a 7-round magazine. It was not a small pistol, rugged and accurate at short range, but also heavy with an awkward grip angle. It was prone to jamming throughout most of its service career, owing largely to its cordite ammunition, which left residue that fouled the close tolerances of its diagonally locking breech. The problem was officially resolved in 1941 with the introduction of the Mark Iz (nitrocellulose) cartridge.

The first examples of the pistol had the safety on left side of the hammer, but later models moved the safety to the left side of the frame, where it could also lock the slide. A grip safety was provided on the military models. The pistol had dual ejectors. The slide stop was activated by the absence of a cartridge in the feedway, not by the magazine follower as in most automatics. A drift-adjustable rear sight had range-hashmarks in micrometers.

Although never officially adopted by the British Army, Webley self-loaders were widely used as a substitute-standard or personal weapons by British and Commonwealth forces in both World Wars. Versions were also marketed to colonial military and police forces and were widely adopted.

The 1906 Webley &amp; Scott Self Loading Pistol in .32 ACP was adopted by the London Metropolitan Police in 1911, and is sometimes referred to as the Webley MP for this reason. It officially replaced the bulldog revolvers then in use following the infamous Siege of Sidney Street in 1911.

==Webley &amp; Scott flare pistols==
Webley &amp; Scott produced a number of single-shot, break open signal flare gun devices used by Commonwealth Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars. The most prolific of these was the No.1 MkIII, produced in 1918 at the company&#x27;s Birmingham facility. A variant, differing only in its use of black plastic grip panels instead of the earlier wood, was produced by Colonial Sugar Refinery in Sydney, Australia in 1942. Perhaps the most famous example of a No.1 Mk 1 flare pistol is in the collection at the Conception Bay Museum, Harbour Grace, NL. The gun was lent by Edward Langdon Oke, IV, a veteran of WW1 and the then editor of the Harbor Grace Standard newspaper, to the first Canadian to make a transatlantic flight, Capt. J. Errol Boyd (1891–1960). Boyd took off 9 Oct 1930 from the Harbour Grace airstrip in the plane Maple Leaf (aka, Columbia), navigated by Lieut. Harry Connor, and landed 10 Oct in Tresco, Scilly Isles, England. The gun was engraved to mark the historic flight and is also tatted with the owner&#x27;s initials. The company logo is that of a bird wing with the tips angling left and W+S underneath and the gun is stamped 7648.

== Webley &amp; Scott in India ==
As part of the Make in India initiative launched in 2014, Webley &amp; Scott began to manufacture its revolvers in India in collaboration with an Indian firm at their Sandila factory, Hardoi district, Uttar Pradesh. The company has also decided to open two shooting ranges in Gorakhpur and Kanpur. In 2020, they began production of weapons for the Indian civilian market, including the Webley Mk IV, and the WP20, a newly built .32 Auto semi-automatic pistol.

<doc id="847100" wikidata="Q1028218" url="?curid=847100" title="Cambrian Mountains">
<text>The Cambrian Mountains (, in a narrower sense: &quot;Elenydd&quot;) are a series of mountain ranges in Wales.
The term &quot;Cambrian Mountains&quot; used to apply to most of the upland of Wales, and comes from the country&#x27;s Latin name . Since the 1950s, its application has become increasingly localised to the geographically homogeneous Mid Wales uplands, known in Welsh as &quot;Elenydd&quot;, which extend from Plynlimon (Pumlumon) to Radnor Forest in the east and Mynydd Mallaen to the south. This barren and sparsely populated &#x27;wilderness&#x27; has been referred to as the Desert of Wales. The area includes the sources of the River Severn and River Wye and was unsuccessfully proposed as a national park in the 1960s and 1970s. The highest point of the range is Plynlimon, at .

The wider, more historic, use of the term also includes Snowdonia in North Wales, and the Brecon Beacons and Black Mountains in South Wales. They range in height up to in Snowdonia.

==Geology and topography==

While Snowdonia contains a mix of volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks of Cambrian and Ordovician age, the mountains of South Wales are mainly Devonian age Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone and similarly aged sandstones. The ranges of mid-Wales on the other hand are predominantly formed from Ordovician and Silurian sandstones and mudstones which in many areas outcrop only infrequently so resulting in more rounded grassy hills. The Cambrian Mountains (in the modern sense of the term) are generally less popular with hillwalkers and scramblers than the ranges to their north and south. Since all of Wales&#x27; ranges face the predominant westerly air stream coming in from the Atlantic Ocean, they enjoy high levels of rainfall and are the source of numerous rivers, among which the rivers Severn and Wye, which rise on the eastern slopes of Pumlumon, are the largest.

==Dams and wind farms==
The Cambrian Mountains host the Elan Valley Reservoirs and Llyn Brianne reservoir, which provide water for the English West Midlands and for South Wales respectively. They include the Clywedog Reservoir and Nant y Moch Reservoir. Cefn Croes, the site of a controversial wind farm project, is in the Cambrian Mountains, just south of the A44 road between Aberystwyth and Llangurig.

==National park proposal==
The area was proposed as a national park in 1965 by the National Parks Commission, a precursor body of the Countryside Commission. However, the proposal was opposed by many farmers and local authorities in the area. Formal consultations on the proposal began in 1970, and in 1971 the Countryside Commission proposed a revised boundary for the designation. The proposed area, of , covered the area of Pumlumon and Elenydd, within an area bounded by the settlements of Machynlleth, Llangurig, Rhayader, Newbridge-on-Wye, Llanwrtyd Wells, Llandovery, Pumsaint, Tregaron, and Devil&#x27;s Bridge. Despite continuing local opposition, the Countryside Commission published the order designating the area on 15 August 1972, and submitted it to the Secretary of State for Wales, Peter Thomas, for confirmation.

Objections to the proposed designation were then made by all five county councils, 5 of the 7 district councils, 5 parish councils, the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association, Plaid Cymru, the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales and others. Support for the designation was expressed by the Ramblers Association, Youth Hostels Association, and Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club. In July 1973, the Secretary of State announced the decision not to proceed with the designation because of &quot;massive evidence of objections&quot;, and also rejected a call to hold a public inquiry. This was the first time such a recommendation on national park designation had not been accepted.

<text>Mid Wales ( or simply &quot;Y Canolbarth&quot;, meaning &quot;the midlands&quot;), or Central Wales, is a region of Wales, encompassing its midlands, in-between North Wales and South Wales. The Mid Wales Regional Committee of the Senedd covered the unitary authority areas of Ceredigion and Powys and the area of Gwynedd that had previously been the district of Meirionnydd. A similar definition is used by the BBC. The Wales Spatial Plan defines a region known as &quot;Central Wales&quot; which covers Ceredigion and Powys.

Mid Wales is dominated by the Cambrian Mountains, including the Green Desert of Wales. The region is sparsely populated, with an economy dependent on farming and small businesses.

== Politics ==
Parliamentary constituencies in Mid Wales include; Brecon and Radnorshire, Ceredigion, Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Montgomeryshire.

The region is represented in the Senedd with an electoral region known as Mid and West Wales.

In April 2021, a Mid Wales Corporate Joint Committee was formed to allow the two local councils in the region to collaborate in areas relating to economic well-being, strategic planning and the development of regional transport policies.

== Mid Wales Growth Deal ==

On 13 January 2022, the Mid Wales Growth Deal&#x27;s Final Deal Agreement was signed between the Growing Mid Wales Board; containing representatives from Ceredigion County Council and Powys County Council, and the UK and Welsh Governments. The deal involves the commitment of £110 million of funding from the two governments, with additional funding provided by other public and private sectors over the span of 10 years. The deal aims to increase investment in the region to £400 million by 2032, support an increase in gross value added of between £570 million and £700 million in the region&#x27;s economy, and create between 1,100 to 1,400 jobs in Mid Wales.

<text>Ornex (; ) is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France.

==Geography==
It is located on the former N5 highway between the Jura mountains and the Swiss border.

Located nine kilometres from Geneva, many inhabitants commute across the Swiss border each morning to jobs with international organizations and multinational corporations. It is bordered in the south by Ferney-Voltaire, in the west by Prévessin-Moëns and Segny, in the north by Versonnex and in the east by the Swiss commune of Collex-Bossy.

A section of the tunnel excavated by CERN between 1983 and 1988 passes under the town. Originally excavated for the LEP collider, the tunnel now houses the Large Hadron Collider that started operating in 2008. The major visible presence of the LHC tunnel in the area are some surface buildings and some large helium gas tanks further North in Cessy. There are also a number of smaller tunnel Access Points, including one on the border of Ornex and Ferney-Voltaire. Liquid helium is used to cool the LHC&#x27;s superconducting magnets.

==History==
The first documented mention of Ornex was in 1153 under the name of &quot;Ornacho&quot;; from 1286 onwards the name of Ornay is mentioned. It is assumed the name was derived from the Roman personal name &quot;Aurinius&quot; or &quot;Orinius&quot; and would thus mean the &quot;manor of Aurinius&quot; (Auriniacum).

While the village church belonged to the monastery of Payerne in the 13th century, the village itself belonged to local gentry, and became part of the fiefdom of the lords of Gex in the 14th century. With this is followed the changeable history of the Pays de Gex in which it was finally ceded from the Dukes of Savoy to France in the Treaty of Lyon in 1601.

==Population==
The census of 1999 revealed that 62.5% of working residents were employed outside of the Ain department.
Between 1975 and 1999, the population of Ornex increased by 1621. The population of Ornex is extremely diverse, representing many nationalities and several languages.

<text>Moulay Brahim Boutayeb (; born 15 August 1967) is a retired Moroccan track and field athlete. He was the winner of the 10,000 m race at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

==Career==
Boutayeb was born in Khemisset, Morocco. Although he had been considered more a 5000 m runner before 1988, he was quite unknown until the Seoul Olympics.

The 10,000 m final at Seoul was started at a very fast pace, pushed along mostly by Kenyans, Kipkemboi Kimeli, and Moses Tanui. A small lead group reached the halfway mark at world record pace, at which point Boutayeb moved to lead. He continued the race at world record pace, but deliberately slowed after the bell to finish in a world&#x27;s fourth fastest time of 27:21.46.

After the Olympic Games, Boutayeb decided to concentrate again on shorter distances, running his personal bests in distances from 1500 m to 5000 m over the next couple of seasons. He placed second in the season rankings for the 1988 IAAF Grand Prix Final. He won a bronze medal in 5000 m at the 1991 World Championships held in Tokyo. At the Barcelona Olympic Games, Boutayeb came fourth in 5000 m, only 0.75 seconds behind the winner Dieter Baumann from Germany.

After being eliminated in his heat of the 5000 m at the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart, Brahim Boutayeb retired from competitive athletics and preferred to concentrate on his new sporting interest as a rally driver.

<doc id="847111" wikidata="Q1790472" url="?curid=847111" title="Robert Benchley">
<text>Robert Charles Benchley (September 15, 1889 – November 21, 1945) was an American humorist best known for his work as a newspaper columnist and movie actor. From his beginnings at &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; while attending Harvard University, through his many years writing essays and articles for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and his acclaimed short films, Benchley&#x27;s style of humor brought him respect and success during his life, from his peers at the Algonquin Round Table in New York City to contemporaries in the burgeoning film industry.

Benchley is remembered best for his contributions to the magazine &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; his essays for that publication, whether topical or absurdist, influenced many modern humorists. He also made a name for himself in Hollywood, when his short movie &quot;How to Sleep&quot; was a popular success and won Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards. He also made many memorable appearances acting in movies such as Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940) and &quot;Nice Girl?&quot; (1941). Also, Benchley appeared as himself in Walt Disney&#x27;s behind the scenes movie, &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; (1941). His legacy includes written work and numerous short movie appearances.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the second son of Charles Henry Benchley and Maria Jane (Moran). They were of Welsh and Northern Irish (Protestant) ancestry, respectively, both from colonial stock. His brother Edmund was thirteen years older. Benchley was later known for writing elaborately fanciful autobiographical statements about himself (at one time asserting that he wrote &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; before being buried at Westminster Abbey).

His father served with the Union army for two years during the Civil War and had a four-year hitch in the Navy before settling again in Worcester, marrying and working as a town clerk. Benchley&#x27;s grandfather Henry Wetherby Benchley, a member of the Massachusetts Senate and Lieutenant Governor during the mid-1850s, went to Houston, Texas and became an activist for the Underground Railroad for which he was arrested and jailed.

===Brother Edmund&#x27;s death===
Robert&#x27;s older brother Edmund (born March 3, 1876) was a 4th year cadet at West Point in 1898 when his class was graduated early to support preparations for the Spanish–American War; he was killed July 1 at the Battle of San Juan Hill.
When news reached the family, Maria&#x27;s stunned reaction was to cry out, &quot;Why couldn&#x27;t it have been Robert?!&quot;; accounts conflict as to whether Robert (who was nine years old at the time) heard this.

Edmund&#x27;s fiancée Lillian Duryea, a wealthy heiress, doted on Robert for many years, and Edmund&#x27;s death may have encouraged the pacifist sympathies present in Robert&#x27;s writing. Additionally, because the news about Edmund had arrived during a July 4th celebration, Robert for the rest of his life associated fireworks with Edmund&#x27;s death.

===Meeting his wife===
Robert Benchley met Gertrude Darling in high school in Worcester. They became engaged during his senior year at Harvard University, and they married in June 1914. Their first child, Nathaniel Benchley, was born a year later. A second son, Robert Benchley Jr., was born in 1919. 

===Education===
Robert grew up and attended South High School in Worcester and was involved in academic and traveling theatrical productions during high school. Thanks to financial aid from his late brother&#x27;s fiancée, Lillian Duryea, he could attend Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire for his final year of high school. Benchley reveled in the atmosphere at the academy, and he remained active in creative extracurricular activities, thereby damaging his academic credentials toward the end of his term.

Benchley enrolled at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea&#x27;s financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity in his first year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was often called upon to entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley&#x27;s talents.

During his first two years at Harvard, Benchley worked with the publications &quot;Harvard Advocate&quot; and the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;. He was elected to the &quot;Lampoon&quot;″s board of directors in his third year. The election of Benchley was unusual, as he was the publication&#x27;s art editor and the board positions typically fell to the foremost writers on the staff. The &quot;Lampoon&quot; position opened a number of other doors for Benchley, and he was quickly nominated to the Signet Society meeting club as well as becoming the only undergraduate member of the Boston Papyrus Club at the time.

Along with his duties at the &quot;Lampoon&quot;, Benchley acted in a number of theatrical productions, including Hasty Pudding productions of &quot;The Crystal Gazer&quot; and &quot;Below Zero&quot;. He also had the position of κροκόδιλος (Crocodilos) for the Pudding in 1912. Benchley kept these achievements in mind as he began to contemplate a career for himself after college. Charles Townsend Copeland, an English professor, recommended that Benchley become a writer, and Benchley and future Benchley illustrator Gluyas Williams from the &quot;Lampoon&quot; considered doing freelance work writing and illustrating theatrical reviews. Another English professor recommended that Benchley speak with the Curtis Publishing Company; but Benchley was initially against the idea, and ultimately accepted a job at a civil service office in Philadelphia. Owing to an academic failure during his senior year due to an illness, Benchley would not receive his Bachelor of Arts from Harvard until the completion of his credits in 1913. His shortcoming was the submission of a &quot;scholarly paper&quot; – which Benchley eventually rectified by a treatise on the U.S. – Canadian Fisheries Dispute, written from the point of view of a cod. He took a position with Curtis soon after he received his diploma.

===Early professional career===

Benchley did copy work for the Curtis Company during the summer following graduation, while doing other odd service jobs, such as translating French catalogs for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. In September, he was hired by Curtis as a full-time staff member, preparing copy for its new house publication, &quot;Obiter Dicta&quot;. The first issue was criticized by management, who felt it was &quot;too technical, too scattering, and wholly lacking in punch.&quot; Things did not improve for Benchley and &quot;Obiter Dicta&quot;, and a failed practical joke at a company banquet further strained the relationship between Benchley and his superiors. He continued his attempts to develop his own voice within the publication, but Benchley and Curtis were not a good match, and he eventually quit, as Curtis was considering eliminating Benchley&#x27;s role and he had been offered a job in Boston with a better salary

Benchley had a number of similar jobs during the following years. His re-entry into public speaking followed the annual Harvard–Yale football game in 1914, where he presented a practical joke involving &quot;Professor Soong&quot; giving a question-and-answer session on football in Chinese. In what the local press dubbed &quot;the Chinese professor caper,&quot; Soong was played by a Chinese-American who had lived in the United States for more than thirty years, and pretended to answer questions in Chinese while Benchley &quot;translated&quot;. While his fame increased, Benchley continued with freelance work, which included his first paid piece for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1914, titled &quot;Hints on Writing a Book,&quot; a parody of the non-fiction pieces then popular. While Benchley&#x27;s pieces were bought by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; from time to time, his work was sporadic, and he accepted a job with the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;.

Benchley started at the &quot;Tribune&quot; as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get statements from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a job with the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s Sunday magazine when it launched, and he was transferred to the magazine&#x27;s staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the &quot;Tribune&quot; proper.

Benchley filled in for P. G. Wodehouse at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; at the beginning of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of &quot;The Thirteenth Chair&quot; to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s rhetoric concerning World War I, and the &quot;Tribune&quot; editors were unhappy with the evolving style and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the &quot;Tribune&quot; terminated the magazine, and Benchley was out of work again. When a rumored vacancy for an editorial job at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; failed to happen, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having made a name for himself at the magazine.

This freelancing attempt did not start out well, with Benchley selling just one piece to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and accumulating countless rejections in two months. When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A. Brady was offered, Benchley accepted it, against the advice of many of his peers. This experience was a poor one, as Brady was extremely difficult to work for. Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government&#x27;s Aircraft Board at the beginning of 1918. His experience there was not much better, and when an opportunity was offered to return to the &quot;Tribune&quot; with new editorial management, Benchley accepted it.

At the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Benchley, along with new editor Ernest Gruening, was in charge of a twelve-page pictorial supplement titled the &quot;Tribune Graphic&quot;. The two were given a good deal of freedom, but Benchley&#x27;s coverage of the war and emphasis on African-American regiments as well as provocative pictorials about lynching in the southern United States earned him and Gruening scrutiny from management. Amid accusations that both were pro-German (the United States was fighting Germany at the time), Benchley tendered his resignation in a terse letter, citing the lack of &quot;rational proof that Dr. Gruening was guilty of...charges made against him...&quot; and management&#x27;s attempts to &quot;smirch the character and the newspaper career of the first man in three years who has been able to make the &quot;Tribune&quot; look like a newspaper&quot;.

Benchley was forced to take a publicity job with the Liberty Loan program, and he continued to freelance until &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine offered him an associate editor job. Benchley mentioned this offer to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; to see if they would match it, as he felt &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was the better magazine, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; offered him the job of managing editor. He accepted and began work there in 1919.

An influence upon Benchley&#x27;s early professional career was the admiration and friendship of the Canadian economist, academic, and humorist Dr. Stephen Leacock. Leacock closely followed the increasing body of Benchley&#x27;s published humor and wit, and began correspondence between them. He admitted to occasional borrowing of a Benchley topic for his own writings. Eventually, he began lobbying gently for Benchley to compile his columns into book form, and, in 1921, was delighted when the result of his nagging - &quot;Of All Things&quot; - was published. The British edition of the book included a Leacock introduction, and Benchley, for his part – in a tribute to Leacock – later said he read everything Leacock ever wrote.

===&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and its aftermath===

Benchley began at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; with fellow &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; and Hasty Pudding Theatricals alumnus Robert Emmet Sherwood and future friend and collaborator Dorothy Parker, who had taken over theatre criticism from P. G. Wodehouse years earlier. The format of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; fit Benchley&#x27;s style very well, allowing his columns to have a humorous style, often as parodies. Benchley&#x27;s work was published typically twice a month. Some of Benchley&#x27;s columns, featuring a character he created, were attributed to his pseudonym Brighton Perry, but he took credit for most of them himself. Sherwood, Parker, and Benchley became friendly, often having long lunches at the Algonquin Hotel. When the editorial managers went on a European journey, the three took advantage of the situation, writing articles mocking the local theatre establishment and offering parodic commentary on a variety of topics, such as the effect of Canadian ice hockey on United States fashion. This worried Sherwood, as he felt it could jeopardize his forthcoming raise.

The situation at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; deteriorated upon management&#x27;s return. They distributed a memo forbidding the discussion of salaries in an attempt to control the staff. Benchley, Parker, and Sherwood responded with a memo of their own, followed by placards around their necks detailing their exact salaries for all to see. Management attempted to issue &quot;tardy slips&quot; for staff who were late. On one of these, Benchley wrote, in very small handwriting, an elaborate excuse involving a herd of elephants on 44th Street. These issues contributed to a general deterioration of morale in the offices, culminating in Parker&#x27;s termination, allegedly due to complaints by the producers of the plays she criticised in her theatrical reviews. Upon learning of her termination, Benchley tendered his own resignation. It was mentioned in &quot;Time&quot; by Alexander Woollcott, who was at a lunch with Benchley, Parker, and others. Given that Benchley had two children at the time of his resignation, Parker referred to it as &quot;the greatest act of friendship I&#x27;d ever seen&quot;.

After Benchley&#x27;s resignation, he received many freelance offers. He worked constantly while claiming he was intensely lazy. He was offered $200 per basic subject article for &quot;The Home Sector&quot;, and a weekly freelance salary from &quot;New York World&quot; to write a book review column three times per week for the same salary he received at &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot; The column, titled &quot;Books and Other Things,&quot; was published for one year and included mundane topics such as &quot;Bricklaying In Modern Practice.&quot; Unfortunately for Benchley, however, his writing a syndicated column for David Lawrence drew the ire of his &quot;World&quot; bosses, and &quot;Books and Other Things&quot; was terminated.

Benchley continued to freelance, submitting humor columns to a variety of publications, including &quot;Life&quot; (fellow humorist James Thurber stated that Benchley&#x27;s columns were the only reason the magazine was read). He continued meeting with his friends at the Algonquin Hotel, and the group became popularly known as the Algonquin Round Table. In April 1920, Benchley obtained a job with &quot;Life&quot; writing theatre reviews, which he would continue doing regularly through 1929, eventually taking complete control of the drama section. His reviews were known for their flair, and he often used them to publicise issues of concern to him, whether petty (people who cough during plays) or more important (such as racial intolerance).

Things changed again for Benchley a number of years into the arrangement. A theatrical production by the members of the Round Table was put together in response to a challenge from actor J. M. Kerrigan, who was tired of the Table&#x27;s complaints about the ongoing theatre season. The result, which played for one night April 30, 1922 at the 49th Street Theatre, was &quot;No Sirree!&quot; (the name being a pun of the European revue &quot;La Chauve-Souris&quot;), &quot;An Anonymous Entertainment by the Vicious Circle of the Hotel Algonquin.&quot; Benchley&#x27;s contribution to the program, &quot;The Treasurer&#x27;s Report,&quot; featured Benchley as a nervous, disorganized man attempting to summarize an organization&#x27;s yearly expenses. The revue was applauded by both spectators and fellow actors, with Benchley&#x27;s performance receiving the biggest laughs. A reprise of &quot;The Treasurer&#x27;s Report&quot; was often requested for future events, and Irving Berlin (who had been musical director for &quot;No Sirree!&quot;) prompted producer Sam H. Harris to request Benchley to perform it as part of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Music Box Revue.&quot; Reluctant to appear onstage as a regular performer, Benchley decided to ask Harris for the outlandish sum of $500 a week for his brief act in order to get out of the situation entirely; when Harris replied &quot;OK, Bob. But for $500 you better be good,&quot; Benchley was completely surprised. The &quot;Music Box Revue&quot; began in September 1921 and played until September 1922, with Benchley appearing in his eleven-minute skit eight times a week (evening performances on Monday through Saturday and matinees on Wednesday and Saturday).

===The movies and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;===
Benchley had continued to receive positive responses from his performing, and in 1925 he accepted a standing invitation from movie producer Jesse L. Lasky for a six-week term writing screenplays at $500. While the session did not yield significant results, Benchley did get writing credit for producing the title cards on the Raymond Griffith silent movie &quot;You&#x27;d Be Surprised&quot; (released September 1926), and was invited to do some titling for two other movies.

Benchley was also hired to help with the book for a George Gershwin musical, &quot;Smarty,&quot; featuring Fred Astaire — Benchley&#x27;s name and Fred Thompson&#x27;s were listed as the book writers on the sheet music issued during the tryout period. This experience was not as positive, as most of Benchley&#x27;s contributions were excised and the final product, &quot;Funny Face&quot;, did not have Benchley&#x27;s name attached.

Worn down, Benchley began his next commitment, motion-picture versions of his pieces &quot;The Treasurer&#x27;s Report&quot; and &quot;The Sex Life of the Polyp,&quot; filmed in 1928 by Fox with its new Movietone sound system. The filming went quickly, and though he was convinced he didn&#x27;t perform well as a screen performer, both shorts were financial and critical successes -- especially when considering that talking short-subject comedies were then in their infancy, and Benchley&#x27;s pioneer efforts helped to establish them. Benchley featured in a third short not written by him, &quot;The Spellbinder&quot;. As &quot;Life&quot; would say after his eventual resignation in 1929, &quot;Mr. Benchley has left Dramatic Criticism for the Talking Movies&quot;.

During the time that Benchley was filming various short movies, he also began working at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which had started in February 1925 under the control of Benchley&#x27;s friend Harold Ross. While Benchley, along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances, was wary of getting involved with another publication for various reasons, he completed some freelance work for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; during the first few years, and was later invited to be newspaper critic. Benchley initially wrote the column using the pseudonym Guy Fawkes (the main conspirator in the English Gunpowder Plot), and the column was well received. Benchley discussed issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism, and the publication flourished. He was invited to be theatre critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1929, quitting &quot;Life&quot;, and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features of the magazine. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an average of forty-eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s.

With the emergence of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Benchley was able to stay away from Hollywood work for a number of years. In 1931, he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a movie that would eventually be titled &quot;Sky Devils,&quot; and he acted in his first feature movie, &quot;The Sport Parade&quot; (1932) with Joel McCrea. The work on &quot;The Sport Parade&quot; caused Benchley to miss the autumn theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of &quot;The Sport Parade&quot; was often credited to Benchley&#x27;s role), but the lure of moviemaking did not disappear, since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the next year for more money than he was making writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

===Benchley on film and &quot;How to Sleep&quot;===

Benchley re-entered Hollywood at the height of the Great Depression and the large-scale introduction of the talkie movies he had begun working with years before. His arrival put him on the scene of a number of productions almost instantly. While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting, one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in &quot;Rafter Romance,&quot; and his work attracted the interest of MGM. Benchley took a role in the feature movie &quot;Dancing Lady&quot; (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, Nelson Eddy, and the Three Stooges. That same year, Benchley appeared in the short movies &quot;Your Technocracy and Mine&quot; for Universal Pictures and &quot;How to Break 90 at Croquet&quot; for RKO. He continued to work in Hollywood a writer and performer, contributing dialogue for the Stuart Palmer mystery &quot;Murder on a Honeymoon&quot; (1935) and appearing in the lavish feature-length production &quot;China Seas&quot; for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, featuring Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Wallace Beery, and Rosalind Russell; Benchley&#x27;s character was a slurring drunk throughout the movie.

Upon its completion, MGM invited Benchley to write and perform in a short production inspired by a Mellon Institute study on sleep commissioned by the Simmons Mattress Company. The resulting movie, &quot;How to Sleep&quot;, was filmed in two days, and it featured Benchley as both the narrator and sleeper—the latter a role Benchley claimed was &quot;not much of a strain, as [he] was in bed most of the time.&quot; Benchley was in fact a last-minute participant. As his son Nathaniel Benchley recalled, &quot;&quot;How to Sleep&quot; was supposed to be a Pete Smith short, but Pete Smith was sick. It was going to be a thing on Simmons mattresses; they had this film of quick shots showing how many positions you take during an evening&#x27;s sleep. They tried to have somebody else do it, who couldn&#x27;t make it, and they finally came to my father and asked if he would try to do it. That&#x27;s what finally wound up being &quot;How to Sleep&quot;.&quot; The film was well received at previews and was promoted heavily, with a still from the film being used in Simmons advertisements. The only group not pleased was the Mellon Institute, which did not approve of the studio mocking their study.

&quot;How to Sleep&quot; was named Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards, and MGM kicked off an entire series of situation-comedy reels, each 10 minutes in length, showing Benchley giving mock-instructional lectures (&quot;How to Be a Detective&quot;, &quot;How to Rest&quot;, etc.) or coping with household situations (&quot;An Evening Alone&quot;, &quot;Home Movies&quot;, etc.).

While starring in his short subjects Benchley returned to feature films, cast in the revue &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot; and in his largest role to that point, the lightweight comedy &quot;Live, Love and Learn.&quot; The latter film is actually more notable for its coming-attractions trailer, &quot;The Glamorous Robert Benchley in &quot;How to Make a Movie Trailer&quot;,&quot; staged like one of his comedy shorts and even using the shorts&#x27; theme song.

Benchley&#x27;s 1937 short &quot;A Night at the Movies,&quot; showing Mr. B.&#x27;s disastrous evening at the neighborhood moviehouse, was his greatest success since &quot;How to Sleep:&quot; it was Oscar-nominated, and secured him a contract for more short subjects. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while &quot;How to Sleep&quot; needed two days, the later short &quot;How to Vote&quot; needed less than twelve hours), and took their toll on Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one day (one of which was &quot;The Courtship of the Newt&quot;), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.

Benchley&#x27;s return yielded two more short films, and his high-profile prompted negotiations for sponsorship of a Benchley radio program and numerous appearances on television shows, including the first television entertainment program ever broadcast, an untitled test program using an experimental antenna on the Empire State Building. The radio program, &quot;Melody and Madness&quot; - with the &quot;Melody&quot; provided by Artie Shaw - was a showcase for Benchley&#x27;s acting, as he did not participate in writing it. It was not well received and it was removed from the schedule, although television was still in its experimental stages and few people saw the program, doing little or no damage to Benchley&#x27;s reputation.

===Later life===
The year 1939 was a bad year for Benchley&#x27;s career. Besides the cancellation of his radio show, Benchley learned that MGM did not plan to renew his shorts contract, and &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; frustrated with Benchley&#x27;s film career taking precedence over his theatre column, appointed Wolcott Gibbs to take over in his stead. Following his final &quot;New Yorker&quot; column in 1940, Benchley signed with Paramount Pictures for a new series of one-reel shorts, all filmed at Paramount&#x27;s Long Island studio in Astoria, New York. Most of them were adapted from his old essays. &quot;The Witness&quot; was based on his 1935 essay &quot;Take the Witness!,&quot; with Benchley fantasizing about conquering a tough cross-examination; &quot;Crime Control&quot; was taken from his 1931 story &quot;The Real Public Enemies,&quot; showing the criminal tendencies of sinister household objects.

In 1940 Benchley appeared in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; for which he is also credited as one of the dialogue writers. In 1941 Benchley received more feature-length roles: Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, in which Benchley tours the various departments of the Disney studio;, &quot;Nice Girl?&quot; with Deanna Durbin, noteworthy for a rare dramatic performance by Benchley; and three for Columbia Pictures, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; starring Fredric March and Loretta Young, &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; starring Fredric March and Veronica Lake, and the farce comedy &quot;Three Girls About Town&quot;, starring Joan Blondell and featuring Benchley.

Benchley&#x27;s roles primarily came as a freelance actor, as his Paramount shorts contract didn&#x27;t pay as well as feature films. Benchley was cast in minor roles for various romantic comedies, some shoots going better than others. He appeared in prominent roles with Fred Astaire in &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (1943). Paramount did not renew his shorts contract when it lapsed in 1942—no fault of Benchley; the studio was suspending all short-subject production in New York.

Benchley signed with MGM with an exclusive contract to work in Hollywood. The situation was not positive for Benchley, as the studio &quot;mishandled&quot; him and kept Benchley too busy to complete his own work. His contract concluded with only four short films completed and no chance of signing another contract. Following the printing of two books of his old &quot;New Yorker&quot; columns, Benchley gave up writing for good in 1943, signing one more contract with Paramount for feature films in December of that year.

While Benchley&#x27;s books and Paramount contract were giving him financial security, he was still unhappy with the turn his career had taken. By 1944 he was taking thankless roles in the studio&#x27;s least distinguished films, like the rustic musical &quot;National Barn Dance&quot;. He also appeared as a guest November 10, 1944 on radio&#x27;s &#x27;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&#x27;. 

By this time Robert Benchley&#x27;s screen image was established as a comic lecturer who tried but failed to clarify any given topic. In this capacity Paramount cast him in the 1945 Bob Hope-Bing Crosby comedy &quot;Road to Utopia&quot;; Benchley interrupts the action periodically to &quot;explain&quot; the nonsensical storyline. On April 22, 1945, he guest starred on the Blue Network&#x27;s (soon to be ABC) top-rated radio series &quot;The Andrews Sisters Show&quot;, sponsored by Nash motor cars &amp; Kelvinator home appliances. His final radio appearances was as a guest on Hildegarde&#x27;s &quot;Raleigh Room&quot; (NBC) on October 30, 1945.

===Death===
Though Benchley had been a teetotaler in his youth, in later life he drank with increasing frequency, and eventually he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. While he completed his year&#x27;s work, his condition continued to deteriorate, and he died in a New York hospital on November 21, 1945. His funeral was private, and his body was cremated and interred in a family plot in Prospect Hill Cemetery on the island of Nantucket.

The 1954 publication of &quot;The Benchley Roundup&quot;, a collection of favorite Robert Benchley essays edited by Nathaniel Benchley, prompted MGM to re-release Benchley&#x27;s movie shorts to theaters in 1955.

In 1960, Benchley was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star at 1724 Vine Street.

===Family===
Nathaniel Benchley also became an author, and he published a biography of his father in 1955. He was also a well-respected fiction and children&#x27;s book author. Nathaniel married and also had sons who became writers: Peter Benchley was known best for the book &quot;Jaws&quot; (which was adapted as the movie of the same name), and Nat Benchley wrote and performed in an acclaimed one-man production based on their grandfather Robert&#x27;s life.

==Algonquin Round Table==
The Algonquin Round Table was a group of New York City writers and actors who met regularly between 1919 and 1929 at the Algonquin Hotel. Initially consisting of Benchley, Dorothy Parker, and Alexander Woollcott during their time at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, the group eventually expanded to over a dozen regular members of the New York media and entertainment, such as playwrights George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly and journalist/critic Heywood Broun, who gained prominence due to his positions during the Sacco and Vanzetti trial. The table gained prominence due to the media attention the members drew as well as their collective contributions to their respective areas.

&quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; is a 1994 American film that depicts the Round Table from the perspective of Dorothy Parker. Campbell Scott portrays Robert Benchley.

==Humor style==
Benchley&#x27;s humor was molded during his time at Harvard. While his skills as an orator were already known by classmates and friends, it was not until his work at the &quot;Lampoon&quot; that his style formed. The prominent styles of humor were then &quot;crackerbarrel&quot; — which relied on devices such as dialects and a disdain for formal education, in the style of humorists like Artemus Ward and David Ross Locke, through his alter-ego Petroleum Vesuvius Nasby — and a more &quot;genteel&quot; style of humor, very literary and upper-class in nature, a style popularized by Oliver Wendell Holmes. While the two styles were, at first glance, diametrically opposed, they coexisted in magazines such as &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Life.&quot; The &quot;Lampoon&quot; primarily used the latter style, which suited Benchley. While some of his pieces would not have been out of place in a crackerbarrel-style presentation, Benchley&#x27;s reliance on puns and wordplay resonated more with the literary humorists, as shown by his success with &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; known for the highbrow tastes of its readers.

Benchley&#x27;s definition of humor was simple: &quot;Anything that makes people laugh.&quot;

Benchley&#x27;s characters were typically exaggerated representations of the common man. They were designed to create a contrast between himself and the masses; the character is often befuddled by society and is often neurotic in a &quot;different&quot; way—the character in &quot;How to Watch Football&quot;, for instance, finds it sensible for a normal fan to forgo the live experience and read the recap in the local papers. This character, labeled the &quot;Little Man&quot; and in some ways similar to many of Mark Twain&#x27;s protagonists, was based on Benchley himself; the character did not persist in Benchley&#x27;s writing past the early 1930s, but survived in his speaking and acting roles. This character was apparent in Benchley&#x27;s Ivy Oration during his Harvard graduation ceremonies, and would appear throughout his career, such as during &quot;The Treasurer&#x27;s Report&quot; in the 1920s and his work in feature films in the 1930s.

Topical, current-event style pieces written for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; during the war did not lose their levity, either. He was not afraid to poke fun at the establishment (one piece he wrote was titled &quot;Have You a Little German Agent in Your Home?&quot;), and his common man observations often veered into angry rants, such as his piece &quot;The Average Voter,&quot; where the namesake of the piece &quot;[F]orgets what the paper said...so votes straight Republicrat ticket.&quot; His lighter fare did not hesitate to touch upon topical issues, drawing analogies between a football game and patriotism, or chewing gum and diplomacy and economic relations with Mexico.

In his films, the common man exaggerations continued. Much of his time in the films was spent spoofing himself, whether it was the affected nervousness of the treasurer in &quot;The Treasurer&#x27;s Report&quot; or the discomfort in explaining &quot;The Sex Life of the Polyp&quot; to a women&#x27;s club. The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as &quot;Lesson Number One&quot;, &quot;Furnace Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Stewed, Fried and Boiled&quot;, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks. Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities, such as the incapable sportscaster Benchley played in &quot;The Sport Parade.&quot;

Benchley&#x27;s humor inspired a number of later humorists and filmmakers. Dave Barry, author, onetime humor writer for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, and judge of the 2006 and 2007 Robert Benchley Society Award for Humor, has called Benchley his &quot;idol&quot; and he &quot;always wanted to write like [Benchley].&quot; Horace Digby claimed that, &quot;[M]ore than anyone else, Robert Benchley influenced [his] early writing style.&quot; Outsider filmmaker Sidney N. Laverents lists Benchley as an influence as well, and James Thurber used Benchley as a reference point, citing Benchley&#x27;s penchant for presenting &quot;the commonplace as remarkable&quot; in &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;. In 1944, Benchley starred as Mitty in an adaptation of the story for the radio anthology series, &quot;This Is My Best&quot;.

==Works==
Benchley produced over 600 essays, which were initially compiled in twelve volumes, during his writing career. He also appeared in a number of films, including 48 short treatments that he mostly wrote or co-wrote and numerous feature films.

Posthumously, Benchley&#x27;s works continue to be released in books such as the 1983 Random House compilation &quot;The Best of Robert Benchley&quot;, and the 2005 collection of short films &quot;Robert Benchley and the Knights of the Algonquin,&quot; which compiled many of Benchley&#x27;s popular short films from his years at Paramount with other works from fellow humorists and writers Alexander Woollcott and Donald Ogden Stewart.

<text>The OPC Foundation (Open Platform Communications, formerly Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control) is an industry consortium that creates and maintains standards for open connectivity of industrial automation devices and systems, such as industrial control systems and process control generally. The OPC standards specify the communication of industrial process data, alarms and events, historical data and batch process data between sensors, instruments, controllers, software systems, and notification devices.

The OPC Foundation started in 1994, as a task force comprising five industrial automation vendors (Fisher-Rosemount, Rockwell Automation, Opto 22, Intellution, and Intuitive Technology), with the purpose of creating a basic OLE for Process Control specification. OLE is a technology developed by Microsoft Corporation for the MS Windows operating system. The task force released the OPC standard in August 1996. The OPC Foundation was chartered to continue development of interoperability specifications and includes manufacturers and users of devices instruments, controllers, software and enterprise systems. 

The OPC Foundation cooperates with other organizations, such as MTConnect, who share similar missions.

== OPC standards and specification groups ==
; OPC Data Access : This group of standards provides specifications for communicating real-time data from data acquisition devices such as PLCs to display and interface devices like Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI). The specifications focus on the continuous communication of data

; OPC Alarms and Events : Standards for communicating alarm and event data on demand, as opposed to the continuous communications in the OPC Data Access group 

; OPC Batch : Standards to address the needs of batch processes

; OPC Data eXchange : This group of standards addresses server to server communications across industrial networks. The standards also address remote configuration, diagnostics, monitoring and management communications

; OPC Historical Data Access : Standards for communicating stored data

; OPC Security : Standards for controlling client access to OPC compliant devices and systems

; OPC XML-DA : Builds on the OPC Data Access specifications to communicate data in XML. Incorporates SOAP and Web services

; OPC Complex Data : Standards for specifying the communication of complex data types such as binary data and XML documents

; OPC Commands : Standards for communicating control commands to devices and systems

; OPC Unified Architecture : An entirely new set of standards that incorporates all of the functionality of the above standards (and more), but does so using cross platform web services and other modern technology.

; OPC Certification : The OPC Foundation has a well established Certification Process. The OPC Foundation calls this the OPC Enhanced Certification Program.
The OPC Foundation enhanced the range for certification of OPC product to meet the increasing demand for reliable functionality and insured interoperability. The self-certification using the ComplianceTestTool (CTT) and the participation at an Interoperability Workshop (IOP) are now enhanced with a Certification in an independent test facility. According to the test specification here not only the OPC Data Access (DA2/3) interface is tested but also the overall behavior of the product in a real world environment is verified. OPC Certification

<text>Amin Ahmad Razi (), was the author of the &quot;Haft eqlim&quot; (), a Persian geographical and biographical encyclopedia composed in 1593–94.

Amin Razi was born in Ray, Persia into a prestigious family; his father was Ahmad Tehrani, the mayor of Ray by appointment of Tahmasp I (r. 1524–1576). His paternal uncle was Khvajeh Mohammad-Sharif, a poet and minister to the governor of Khorasan and later to the Shah.

Amin Razi states that he completed his encyclopedia in AH 1002 (1593/4) after six years of work, although the work as extant includes additions of younger date. His dates of birth and death are unknown. He may have visited Mughal India during the reign of Akbar.

&quot;Haft eqlim&quot; (also &quot;Haft iqlīm&quot;) provides extensive historical, biographical and topographical information, arranged by &quot;clime&quot;, i.e. the major division of the known world by geographic latitude according to Ptolemy.
The total number of biographies in the work is 1,560, in many cases giving more detail than those found in medieval works such as Lubab ul-Albab or Tazkirat al-Awliya.
The work also cited samples of poetry which is not recorded elsewhere, and some prose passages, e.g. by Ubayd Zakani.

Amin Razi&#x27;s sources have been researched by Naqawī,
who identified thirty-nine. Ethé provides a table of the contents of the work. 
The work survives in numerous manuscripts. The only complete edition is by Jawād Fāżel (1961). The Calcutta edition by Ross et al. is superior to Fāżel&#x27;s but is incomplete, omitting the fourth clime (which encompasses more than half of the work).

<text>41 Squadron is a light transport squadron of the South African Air Force. It was formed in 1940, it is currently based at AFB Waterkloof.

==History==
===World War II===
41 Squadron was formed at AFS Waterkloof on 16 October 1940 as an army co-operation squadron equipped with the Hawker Hartbees aircraft, serving in East Africa. On 1 September 1941 the squadron received a number of Curtiss Mohawks and these were grouped into &quot;41 Squadron Fighter Detachment&quot; – this detachment was later transferred to 3 Squadron. The squadron remained behind in Abyssinia in 1942 when the rest of the South African forces moved into the Western Desert, with some Hurricanes being taken on strength in mid-1942.

By 1943 the squadron had been fully converted to Hurricane Mk Is and in April–May 1943 it moved from Kenya to Egypt, where it was re-equipped with Hurricane Mk IIBs. The squadron was used in a defensive role and was responsible for the air defence of central and eastern Egypt. The only offensive operation was a single fighter sweep over Crete on 23 July 1943.

In February 1944 the squadron received Spitfire Mk.IXs to supplement the Hurricanes and to permit high-altitude interceptions. All of the Hurricanes were replaced with Spitfire Mk V Cs in April 1944. By mid-April, the unit was made responsible for the air protection of Palestine and later moved to Palestine in August 1944. Its wartime role ended on 30 November 1944 when it was disbanded.

===Later history===
The squadron was reformed in January 1963 as the first Citizen Force part-time Army co-operation unit, flying Austers and later Cessna 185s from Grand Central Aerodrome.

<text>Kerman (; ) is a city in the Central District of Kerman County, Kerman province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district.

== History ==

Kerman was founded as a defensive outpost, with the name Veh-Ardashir, by Ardashir I, founder of the Sasanian Empire, in the 3rd century AD. 

After the Battle of Nahāvand in 642, the city came under Muslim rule. At first, the city&#x27;s relative isolation allowed Kharijites and Zoroastrians to thrive there, but the Kharijites were wiped out in 698, and the population was mostly Muslim by 725. 

Already in the eighth century the city was famous for its manufacture of cashmere wool shawls and other textiles. 

The Abbasid Caliphate&#x27;s authority over the region was weak, and power passed in the tenth century to the Buyid emirs. The region and city fell to Mahmud of Ghazni in the late tenth century. The name Kerman was adopted at some point in the tenth century.
Under the rule of the Seljuk Turks in the 11th and 12th centuries, Kerman remained virtually independent, conquering Oman and Fars. When Marco Polo visited Kerman in 1271, it had become a major trade emporium linking the Persian Gulf with Khorasan and Central Asia. Subsequently, however, the city was sacked many times by various invaders. Kerman expanded rapidly during the Safavid dynasty. Carpets and rugs were exported to England and Germany during this period.
In 1793 Lotf Ali Khan defeated the Qajars, and in 1794 he captured Kerman. But soon after he was besieged in Kerman for six months by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. When the city fell to Agha Mohammad Khan, angered by the popular support that Lotf Ali Khan had received, many of the male inhabitants were killed or blinded, and a pile was made out of 20,000 detached eyeballs and poured in front of the victorious Agha Mohammad Khan. Many women and children were sold into slavery, and in 90 days the city turned into ruins. However, the Zoroastrians of Kerman who had been strong supporters of Lotf Ali Khan suffered the wrath of the founder of Qajar dynasty the most during this period.The present city of Kerman was rebuilt in the 19th century to the northwest of the old city, but the city did not return to its former size until the 20th century.

<text>Model M keyboards are a group of computer keyboards designed and manufactured by IBM starting in 1985, and later by Lexmark International, Maxi Switch, and Unicomp. The keyboard&#x27;s different variations have their own distinct characteristics, with the vast majority having a buckling-spring key design and uniform profile, swappable keycaps. Model M keyboards are notable among computer enthusiasts and frequent typists due to their durability, typing-feel consistency, and their tactile and auditory feedback.

The popularity of the IBM PC and its successors made the Model M&#x27;s design influential: Almost all later general-purpose computer keyboards mimicked its key layout and other aspects of its ergonomics. The layout was standardized by ISO in 1994 and ANSI in 1998, with minor additions—most notably the Windows key and Menu key.

The Model M is regarded as a classic and durable piece of hardware. Although the computers and computer peripherals produced concurrently with them are considered obsolete, many Model M keyboards are still in use due to their physical durability and the continued validity of their ANSI 101-key and ISO 102-key layouts, through the use of a PS/2-female-to-USB-male adapter with a built-in interface converter. Since their original popularity, new generations have discovered their unique functionality and aesthetics.

It is estimated that during the IBM and Lexmark years, over 10 million Model Ms were shipped. Their mass-market success ended in the 1990s amid an industry-wide switchover to lower-cost rubber dome over membrane keyboards. IBM stopped producing the Model M keyboard in 1996.

== History ==
The Model M keyboard was designed to be less expensive to produce than the Model F keyboard it replaced. Principal design work was done at IBM in 19831984, drawing on a wide range of user feedback, ergonomic studies, and examination of competing products. Its key layout, significantly different from the Model F&#x27;s, owed much (including notably the inverted-T arrangement of its arrow keys) to the LK-201 keyboard shipped with the VT220 serial terminal.

Production of Model M keyboards began in 1985. They were often bundled with new IBM computers. While today primarily associated with the IBM PC and its successors, it actually first shipped with the 3161 terminal and was deployed across several other IBM product lines as well, notably including the 5250 terminal and the RS/6000.

They were produced at IBM plants in Lexington, Kentucky; Greenock, Scotland; and Guadalajara, Mexico. The most common variant is the IBM Enhanced Keyboard identified by IBM assembly part number 1391401, the U.S. English layout keyboard bundled with the IBM Personal System/2. Until around 1993, most Model Ms included a coiled, detachable cable, with either an AT (pre-1987) or PS/2 connector, in 5- and 10-foot lengths (1.5 and 3 meters). From about 1994 onwards, flat non-detachable cables were used to reduce manufacturing costs; however, IBM retained its 101-key layout, never implementing the Microsoft Windows keys common on other keyboards from that time. Unicomp later designed a 104-key Model M with Windows keys.

On March 27, 1991, IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including keyboard production, forming Lexmark International. Lexmark continued manufacturing Model M keyboards in the United States, United Kingdom, and Mexico, with IBM as their major customer. Many of these keyboards are identified by IBM assembly part numbers 52G9658, 52G9700, 71G4644, 82G2383, and 42H1292, which were bundled with IBM PS/ValuePoint and IBM PC Series.

Over the next four years, cost pressure led to several minor design changes intended to lower the part and fabrication costs of Lexmark Model Ms. The case and metal backplate were repeatedly lightened. The cable jack and detachable SDL cable were replaced with a fixed cable. Some variants were made with a single color for key legends.

In 1995 Lexmark made the most sweeping design change in the Model M&#x27;s history, altering the size and location of the internal controller board. While the new &quot;press-fit&quot; design successfully lowered manufacturing costs by eliminating the two ribbon cables and separate LED daughterboard of older versions, the controller&#x27;s new card-edge connector proved to be a failure point that shortened the keyboard&#x27;s average lifetime. The classic era of the Model M is generally considered to have ended with this change, though a few on the older pattern continued to be made at Greenock and Guadalajara until 1999. Relatively few press-fit model Ms have survived.

During the Lexmark years, a few Model M variants were manufactured with rubber-dome key switches rather than buckling springs. Due to these switches&#x27; comparatively short durability, few of these variants have survived. Despite their rarity, today&#x27;s enthusiasts and collectors do not value them nearly as highly as the more common buckling-spring variants.

A five-year agreement obligating IBM to purchase nearly all of its keyboards from Lexmark expired on March 27, 1996. Lexmark exited the keyboard business, selling related assets to IBM and Maxi Switch. When Lexmark discontinued keyboard production in April 1996, IBM continued producing buckling-spring Model M&#x27;s in Scotland until 1999. Maxi Switch purchased assets for rubber-dome keyboards and the Lexmark Select-Ease Keyboard (model M15), including a buckling-spring switch patent. They continued to manufacture the IBM Enhanced Keyboard with TrackPoint II (model M13) in Mexico until 1998.

Some of Lexmark&#x27;s keyboard manufacturing assets were also sold to a group of Lexmark employees, who formed Unicomp whose basic version of the Model M was similar to part number 42H1292, first renamed 42H1292U and later the Customizer. There have been other configurations, including updated 104- and 105-key layouts; a Unix layout (where the Ctrl, Caps Lock, Esc, and tilde keys are transposed); models with integrated pointing sticks and trackballs; and POS-specific models such as those with built-in magstripe readers. All used the press-fit controller characteristic of late Lexmarks.

Unicomp continued to use the original IBM machinery to produce Model Ms, leading to a gradual decline in quality as the tooling became worn. This, and various problems with their USB controllers helped keep a market for vintage Model Ms thriving. In 2020 Unicomp replaced its tooling and shipped a &quot;New Model M&quot; with noticeably improved build quality that more closely resembles the classic 1391401 (though with a 104- or 103-key layout and USB); many older variants are no longer sold on Unicomp&#x27;s website and some still on sale have been deprecated.

== Variations ==
The Model M&#x27;s numerous variations (referred to as &quot;part numbers&quot;) incorporated alternative features and/or colors. One of the more sought after variants of the Model M keyboard is the Space Saving Keyboard, which integrates the number pad into the keyboard&#x27;s main section, substantially reducing its width. The Space Saving Keyboard is likely the origin of the keyboard layout that is generally known as a &quot;Tenkeyless keyboard.&quot;

IBM released the standard and Space Saving Model M&#x27;s in an alternative &#x27;gray/pebble&#x27; color for use with their Industrial computers, designed to conceal discoloration from handling in production environments. Other variable features include a grounded spacebar and, on some later models, drainage holes to deter damage from spilled liquids.


The M2 was a late Lexmark variation issued under cost pressure from competing rubber-dome keyboards. Some revisions used rubber-dome switches; others retained buckling springs. All had a much thinner, lighter case and discarded the metal backplate. It can easily be distinguished from the original Model M design by its flat, unsculpted front case section; also the manufacturing label, if present, says &quot;M2&quot; rather than &quot;M.&quot; M2s were poorly fabricated and notoriously unreliable; comparatively few survived into the 21st century, and Model M enthusiasts do not value them.

The M2 should in turn be distinguished from the M5, another Lexmark variant which returned to the rugged Model M case/backplate construction but added a built-in trackball; and those two from the M13, which was also built like rugged Model Ms but featured a pointing stick. The M5 and M13 designs are still carried by Unicomp in 2021 under the names Trackball Classic and Endura Pro.

== Design ==
The variant most commonly referred to as &quot;Model M&quot; is Part No. 1391401, on which many other variants were based. This model, known as the Enhanced Keyboard, included IBM&#x27;s patented buckling spring design and swappable keycaps.

The Model M&#x27;s design has been widely described as reliable, and the design has not changed significantly over time. Thanks to the M&#x27;s design, including its heavy steel backplate and strong plastic frame, many early Model M Keyboards are still functional four decades past release.

The Model M&#x27;s buckling spring key design specification gives it a unique feel and sound. Unlike more common and lower-end rubber dome designs, buckling springs give users a notable tactile and auditory feedback. Because of its more defined touch, some users report they can type faster and more accurately on the Model M than on other keyboards. Additionally, many model M enthusiasts believe that tactile-feedback keyboards like the Model M reduce stress on the hands, preventing or even reversing repetitive strain injury. Significant pressure is required to press the keys, and a pronounced sound results to help typists previously trained on typewriters who had become accustomed to that level of feedback. This resulted in the Model M sometimes being referred to as the &quot;clicky keyboard.&quot;

Until the late fourth-generation variants, most Model Ms were manufactured with a 1.25&quot; slotted, circular speaker grille in their bottom surfaces. Relatively few contain an actual speaker, however, which was useful only for sounding beep codes on older terminal systems. The most common P/Ns with speakers are 1394540 and 51G872, made for RS/6000 UNIX workstations.

Model Ms have been manufactured to quite a number of different interface and connector standards, some of which (such as the 5-pin DIN used on 5250 terminals) are poorly documented and have had to be reverse-engineered by enthusiasts. Early variants shipped with the PC XT and AT used connectors specific to those systems. After the introduction of the PS/2 most shipped with a connector for a PS/2 port; these included the 1391401. Unicomp introduced support for USB.

Older model Ms used a detachable cable utilizing SDL. Later Lexmark and Unicomp variants used a fixed cable.

<doc id="847154" wikidata="Q766230" url="?curid=847154" title="Keith Duffy">
<text>Keith Peter Thomas Francis Julian John Duffy (born 1 October 1974) is an Irish singer, actor, radio and television presenter and drummer who began his professional music career as part of Irish boy band Boyzone alongside Ronan Keating, Mikey Graham, Shane Lynch and Stephen Gately in 1993. The band decided to focus on solo projects in 2000, since which Duffy has taken acting roles in soap operas such as &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Fair City&quot;. He has also presented &quot;The Box&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot;.

Duffy has been an autism awareness campaigner since his daughter was diagnosed with the condition at age 18 months, and acts as the patron for Irish Autism Action holding regular fundraising events and informational talks.

Duffy was the winner on the British reality series &quot;The Door&quot; in 2010 and came third in the first series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in 2001, and in the second series of &quot;Splash!&quot; in 2014.

== Early life ==
Duffy was born on 1 October 1974 in Donaghmede, Dublin to parents Sean and Pat. He has an older brother, Derek, and a younger brother, John. He was raised Roman Catholic. As a young child he contracted pneumonia. He attended primary school at Belgrove National School and secondary school at Ardscoil Rís and Plunket&#x27;s. Between the ages of 7 and 18 he played hurling and Gaelic football, representing the Dublin under-16 hurling team for three years. At the age of 16 he bought a drum kit and played in bands called Toledo Moon and This Burning Effigy. Duffy studied architecture for a year at college, before dropping out.

== Career ==
Duffy first became aware of Boyzone after hearing auditions to become a member were being held. He was unsuccessful in securing an audition, but was later noticed by Louis Walsh (who became the band&#x27;s manager) whilst dancing in Dublin&#x27;s POD Nightclub and was invited to audition. Duffy sang Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Piano Man&quot; and danced to Right Said Fred&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot;. He was chosen as one of the original members of the band. He played a backing role in Boyzone, with Ronan Keating and Stephen Gately handling the majority of lead vocals. In 1994, Duffy and fellow band member Shane Lynch were involved in a nearly fatal car crash; both survived without serious injuries. Boyzone performed together for the last time before their hiatus in Ireland at the Point Theatre during nine dates running from 3—8 January and 10—12 January 2000; they had sold more than 13 million records in total by this time and all sixteen of their singles had reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. They also became the first Irish act to have four number one hits in the United Kingdom charts.

After Boyzone disbanded in 2000, Duffy teamed up with Shane Lynch and released their pop-rap version of &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; under the name Keith &#x27;N&#x27; Shane. It was a top 40 hit in the UK, peaking at No. 36 in December 2000. Duffy&#x27;s profile was raised as a result of his appearance on the first series of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in 2001, where he finished third out of six, and on Lily Savage&#x27;s &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;. In the same year, he appeared on the celebrity special in the fourth season of &quot;Fort Boyard&quot; alongside &quot;Tris Payne&quot;, &quot;Scott Wright&quot;, &quot;Sally Gray&quot;, and &quot;Nell McAndrew&quot;. He branched out to acting, most notably on the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as the character Ciaran McCarthy. What was meant to be a three-week stint on the show turned into three years from 2002 to 2005, with Duffy leaving the show to be closer to his family in Ireland.

The year 2005 saw Duffy take to the stage for the first time as Damien in the play &quot;Dandelions&quot; at Dublin&#x27;s Olympia Theatre. Duffy also played the title role in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, staged at the Weymouth Pavilion in Weymouth, Dorset.

In May 2008, it was announced that Boyzone would return with their &quot;Back Again... No Matter What&quot; Tour which sold over 200,000 tickets within three hours. The tour began on 25 May 2008 at Belfast&#x27;s Odyssey arena and finished at Carlisle Bitts Park on 23 August 2008. Duffy went on to play the part of James &quot;Ringo&quot; Leyden in 2008 in the Irish soap opera &quot;Fair City&quot;, with his character leaving the show in 2009. Boyzone then played their &quot;Better&quot; Tour, which was the last tour to feature member Stephen Gately. Duffy acted as pall-bearer at Gately&#x27;s funeral on 16 October. Speaking after Gately&#x27;s death, Duffy reminisced on the early days: &quot;He told Louis [Walsh] he was 5ft 7in. When he auditioned for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; later on, he said he was 5ft 3in. But he was a true giant of a man&quot;.

Duffy became presenter of &quot;The Box&quot; on Irish television channel TV3, as well as featuring in Irish comedy &quot;Mrs Brown&quot;. He later served as a judge on the RTÉ talent contest &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot;, later presenting the fifth series of the show.

Landing his first major feature-film role in 2010, Duffy was cast in Irish horror film &quot;Loftus Hall&quot;. He reportedly had to bow out of the production due a prior contract stipulation committing him to a 2010 &quot;Coronation Street&quot; return, which would have interfered with the film&#x27;s schedule. Subsequently, he returned to the soap in February 2010, reprising his role as lovable Irish rogue Ciaran McCarthy.

On 2 and 3 April 2010, Duffy appeared in ITV&#x27;s one-off game show &quot;The Door&quot;. He won the show and his prize was £25,000 for a charity of his choice – Ambitious about Autism (a UK-based charity for autism education, then known as TreeHouse). In June 2010, he continued his work with Autism, launching a mobile phone recycling campaign in Ireland. He also appeared on &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot; on 11 September 2010 again raising money for Ambitious about Autism.

After leaving &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in January 2011, Duffy returned to Boyzone who reunited and toured the UK and Ireland during February and March 2011, with a 21-date tour of Ireland and UK with their arena-based &quot;Brother&quot; Tour and four outdoor shows around the UK during August. Following the end of the &quot;Brother&quot; Tour, Duffy completed a half Ironman Triathlon raising money for Irish Autism Action. He returned to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in September 2011 for a short stint. His last appearance as Ciaran was on 25 November 2011.

From November 2011 to February 2012, Duffy played character Teddy Heelin in John B. Keane&#x27;s play &quot;Big Maggie&quot; which visited many theatres in Ireland. Fellow Boyzone member Shane Lynch said in an interview on ITV show &quot;Loose Women&quot; that Boyzone would be releasing a new album and would be touring in 2013, the 20th anniversary of their formation.
In November 2013, he appeared as a drug dealing fitness instructor in two episodes of Irish crime drama &quot;Love/Hate&quot;.

===2016–present: Boyzlife===
Boyzlife is a duo consisting of Duffy and Brian McFadden, who previously appeared as members of &#x27;90s and 2000s boybands Boyzone and Westlife, respectively.

In February 2020, Duffy invited John Junior, Mental Health Activist on stage with Brian McFadden on their Boyzlife tour to share his mental health journey with their fans. Junior travels around the United Kingdom with Charlie The Duck, who accompanies him, encouraging people to speak up about mental health. Duffy is friends with Junior and supports his campaign to raise awareness for mental health.

On 19 January 2022, the duo announced the release of their upcoming second studio album, &quot;Old School&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Duffy married Lisa Smith on 24 June 1998 in Las Vegas, only proposing two days before. Ronan Keating acted as his best man. Together, Keith and Lisa have two children, Jordan Stephen Scott Duffy (born 22 April 1995) and Mia Duffy (born 11 March 2000).
After Mia was diagnosed with moderate autism, Duffy has become active in raising awareness of the condition and in October 2014 received an Honorary Fellowship from the RCSI.

Duffy was also present in Kilcloon, Meath on 2 March 2012 for the official opening of &#x27;Stepping Stones&#x27;, a specialised school for children with autism stating &quot;All we want to do is give our kids a chance in life&quot;.

== Charity work ==
Following his daughter&#x27;s diagnosis with autism at 22 months old in 2000, he has supported different autism charities and campaigned for better support for autistic children in his native Ireland. He stepped down as patron of “Irish Autism Action” after ten years in 2015, raising over €8,000,000 for the organisation in that time. He subsequently began his own charity, the Keith Duffy Foundation, to support autism charities throughout Ireland.

In 2022 he played in the Celebrity Series of the Legends Tour golf tour at tournaments including the Staysure Senior PGA (2021) and the Celebrity Series Grand Final in Mauritius (2021 season, delayed to 2022), winning the event and £25,000 (€29,500) for the charity ASIAM.ie, which helps provide support for children with autism.

===Final===


Going into the final stages of the game, the scores were level at 27–27. A drop goal from Diego Domínguez then put Stade three points ahead. Meanwhile, Leicester brought on replacement scrum-half Jamie Hamilton for starting fly-half Andy Goode, with starting scrum-half Austin Healey switching to fly-half. Glenn Gelderbloom was also brought on at outside centre, with Leon Lloyd switching from outside centre to wing.

Leicester won a penalty just inside their own half and kicked to the left-hand touchline. The resulting line-out throw was too high and but it was cleaned up by Neil Back at the back of the line. Back passed the ball to out to Healey, though the pass forced Healey to check his run to gather the ball. With the two sets of opposing backs 20 metres apart for the line-out, the Tigers backs executed a pre-called backs move. Healey would dummy scissors with inside centre Pat Howard, another dummy scissors with outside centre Glenn Gelderbloom before the ball would be passed to the big full back Tim Stimpson who would take the ball into contact. Howard drew Domínguez and Gelderbloom drew the Stade inside centre, but the Stade outside centre who had only been on the field a few minutes, drifted onto Stimpson. Healey broke the Stade defensive line through the gap, before drawing the full back and putting Leon Lloyd in the right hand corner.

Lloyd&#x27;s second try of the game gave Leicester a two-point lead, with the conversion to come. If Stimpson missed, another goal would give Stade the lead. If he scored the conversion, however, Stade would need a try. The kick from the right-hand touchline was from the most difficult position on the field for a right-footed kicker. Stimpson however hit the conversion straight between the posts, and Leicester were able to hang on to their lead for victory.

<text>This is a list of all mayors and lord mayors of London (leaders of the City of London Corporation, and first citizens of the City of London). Until 1354, the title held was mayor of London. The dates are those of being elected to office on 29 September, excepting those years when it fell on the Sabbath; the office is not actually entered until the second week of November. Therefore, the years elected below do not represent the main calendar year of service. In 2006, the title Lord Mayor of the City of London was devised, for the most part, to avoid confusion with the office of mayor of London. However, the legal and commonly used title and style remains Lord Mayor of London.

<doc id="847171" wikidata="Q939597" url="?curid=847171" title="Mega-Lo-Mania">
<text>Mega-Lo-Mania is a real-time strategy video game developed by Sensible Software. It was released for the Amiga in 1991 and ported to other systems. It was released as Tyrants: Fight Through Time in North America and &quot;Mega Lo Mania: Jikū Daisenryaku&quot; (&quot;メガロマニア時空大戦略&quot;) in Japan. The game was re-released on ZOOM-Platform.com via Electronic Arts on August 31, 2022.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot; is an early real-time strategy game that predates &quot;Dune II&quot; by a year. The player takes control of one of four gods; Scarlet (red), Caesar (green), Oberon (yellow) and Madcap (blue). There are no differences between them except colour and AI behaviour when opposing. Each level takes place on an island divided into two to sixteen &quot;sectors&quot;. The objective is to defeat up to three opposing gods and conquer the island.

Before a level begins, the player decides which sector to place their first tower in, and how many men to deploy. The men can perform various tasks such as designing weapons and shields, mining elements, building structures, manufacturing weapons and forming an army. The number of men assigned to a single task determines how fast or effective it will be. Men that are left idle will procreate and gradually increase in number.

At the start of a level the player only has unarmed men available. To gain more powerful weaponry, the player must assign men to design technology. When enough designs are made, the sector will advance a tech-level; making more research and buildings available. Armies can be used to either invade enemy sectors, or build a tower in an empty sector; expanding the player&#x27;s territory. Shields are used to repair damaged buildings. Weapons and shields can only be made if enough elements have been gathered. Higher-tech weapons and shields must be manufactured in the factory before use. Building a mine gives access to more elements and the laboratory improves design tasks.

If the sector&#x27;s tower gets destroyed, the player loses control of that sector. If the player has no sectors or men left, the level must be restarted.

The player has the option to form an alliance with an opponent if there are two or three present on the map. An allied opponent will not attack the player but neither of them can expand their territory whilst allied. Alliances cannot be made if only one opponent is remaining.

There are twenty-eight islands in the game, which are named in alphabetical order (except the last two) and grouped into ten epochs. Each epoch contains three islands and represents a different era in time (starting at 9500 BC and ending at 2001 AD); conquering the three islands in any order will allow the player to proceed to the next epoch. The player receives one-hundred men in each epoch. Any unused are carried over to the next epoch. The only exception is the tenth epoch, which contains only one eponymous island and does not grant extra men to the player.

==Development==
The Amiga and Atari ST versions of &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot;, as developed by Sensible Software and published by Image Works, began development in November 1989, and were released in the Spring of 1991 for the Amiga and Atari ST; a DOS version wasn&#x27;t planned at this stage in development. In a January 1991 issue of British gaming magazine &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;The One&quot; interviewed team members from Sensible Software for information regarding &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&#x27;s&quot; development in a pre-release interview. &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot; was originally conceived under the title &quot;Alien Empire&quot; and later &quot;My Little Warhead&quot;, but these names were scrapped in lieu of the final title of &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot;. The game&#x27;s original concept had the player taking the role of an operator of a spaceship who needed to combat robots located on an island, with the island being split into 16 sections. The goal of this original design concept was to combine scrolling arcade action gameplay with real-time strategy; this concept is vastly different from the final product due to lack of publisher interest, as they considered the game to &#x27;not fit into any specific category&#x27;. Jonathan Hare, &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&#x27;s&quot; graphic artist and one of its designers, expressed that the game was changed from its original concept to make it more marketable to publishers; he stated that the ultimatum became that the team needed to &quot;drop the scrolling or drop the strategy&quot;, with the team deciding to scrap the game&#x27;s arcade scrolling aspect. Upon scrapping the game&#x27;s original concept of robots, the team considered a fantasy theme, but decided against it.

Upon being asked about &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&#x27;s&quot; similarity to &quot;Populous&quot;, Hare expressed that while it looks &quot;a little&quot; similar, it differs significantly in its gameplay, particularly in its combat, stating that he thinks that &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot; doesn&#x27;t play &quot;like &quot;Populous&quot; at all&quot;. Further expressing his belief in how the game differs from &quot;Populous&quot;, Hare stated that the gameplay concept of human evolution isn&#x27;t unique to &quot;Populous&quot; as &quot;the earth thought of it first&quot;. Richard Joseph, &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&#x27;s&quot; composer and sound designer, hired radio voice actors to perform the game&#x27;s sampled speech; &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot; has over 50 speech samples, and due to their size, the sounds are on a floppy disk of their own. Over the course of development, there was a bug that caused the game to freeze when sounds were loaded, which was later fixed.

==Reception==

&quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot; is considered to be the first real time strategy game to also incorporate a technology tree and was met with universal acclaim on its original release. &quot;Amiga Power&quot; was impressed by the game, and considered it as one of the best games for Amiga. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #34 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.

Conversions to other platforms sometimes received less praise. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; cited many bugs and flaws, and stated that even if they were fixed &quot;not enough attention has been paid to gameplay&quot;. A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game two-plus stars out of five, stating that the &quot;Populous&quot; &quot;clone ... offers a short diversion into strategic whimsy before degenerating into an also-ran&quot;. &quot;MegaTech&quot; magazine said that it was &quot;very easy to get into (but) there are only nine levels&quot;. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked the game 46th on its &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time&quot;.

A sequel was being planned and had started development, but was never released.

<text>Daniel Joseph &quot;Rusty&quot; Staub (April 1, 1944 – March 29, 2018) was an American professional baseball player and television color commentator. He played in Major League Baseball for 23 seasons as a right fielder, designated hitter, and first baseman. He was nicknamed &quot;le Grand Orange&quot; by Expos fans.

A six-time All-Star known for his hitting prowess, Staub produced 2,716 hits over his playing career, just 284 hits shy of the 3,000 hit plateau. He was an original member of the Montreal Expos and the team&#x27;s first star. Although he played just 518 of his 2,951 games as an Expo, his enduring popularity led them to retire his number in 1993, while the Mets inducted him into their team Hall of Fame in 1986.

Staub was also known for his charitable work through the Rusty Staub Foundation, supporting emergency food pantries in New York; and for establishing the New York Police and Fire Widows’ and Children’s Benefit Fund. 

== Early life ==
Staub was born in New Orleans on April 1, 1944, to Raymond and Alma Staub. He was given the nickname &quot;Rusty&quot; by a nurse in the hospital shortly after he was born because of his red hair. Ray Staub had been a minor league catcher in the Class D Florida State League in 1937-38. Ray gave Rusty a baseball bat at only three years old, and began teaching him how to swing from then on. When Staub was a child, Alma&#x27;s brother, a New Orleans policeman, was killed in the line of duty. One of his most vivid and affecting memories in life was sitting on his bed with his mother and brother reciting the rosary for his uncle. This would later lead to his charitable work for police and their families. 

Staub attended Jesuit High School in New Orleans, where he played first base on the baseball team. In 1961, he had a .474 batting average and led the Jesuit Blue Jays to the Louisiana Class AAA baseball championship, hitting a 400-foot home run to win the deciding championship game. He was selected co-Outstanding Player on the Louisiana Sports Writers Association All-State team. As a basketball player, he helped the Blue Jays reach the playoffs in 1960 and 1961. In 1960, Staub and his brother Chuck led their amateur baseball team to the American Legion World Series championship; and in 1961, Staub hit .553 in American Legion ball. 

==Playing career==

===Houston Colt .45s/Astros===
Staub signed his first professional contract with the expansion team Houston Colt .45s organization in 1961. He spent the 1962 season in the Class B Carolina League, and at season&#x27;s end he was named one of the league&#x27;s all-stars and its Most Valuable Player. Following that season, Staub was signed to a US$100,000 Major League contract under the Bonus Rule.

In his first season, aged 19, he played regularly, splitting time between first base and the outfield, but hit only .220. He became only the second major league rookie since 1900 to play 150 games as a teenager; the first had been Bob Kennedy, also 19, with the Chicago White Sox in 1940. The following season, he hit only .216 for the Colts and was sent down to the minor leagues at one point. His statistics steadily improved in the 1965 season for his team, which had been renamed the Astros, and he had a breakout 1967 season, when he led the league in doubles with 44 and was selected to the All-Star team. He collected a hit in twenty straight games from June 30 to July 21, making him the first ever Astro with a twenty game hitting streak; various players have passed him since, starting with Lee May in 1973. He repeated as an All-Star for the Astros in 1968.

===Montreal Expos===

Staub did not get along with Harry Walker, hired by the Astros on June 17, 1968, to move from hitting coach to manager. Walker and general manager H.B. &quot;Spec&quot; Richardson (who felt he was not getting the most out of his contract) decided to trade Staub to the Montreal Expos before the start of their inaugural season in 1969 as part of a deal for Donn Clendenon and Jesús Alou. The trade became a source of controversy as Clendenon (who thought Walker was a racist from his playing days with him in Pittsburgh) refused to report to the Astros and attempted to retire; the deal had to be resolved by Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn who ruled that the deal was official, but that Clendenon was to stay with the Expos. Montreal eventually dealt Jack Billingham, Skip Guinn, and $100,000 as compensation.

Staub was embraced as the expansion team&#x27;s first star, and became one of the most popular players in their history. Embraced by French Canadians because he learned their language, he was nicknamed &quot;Le Grand Orange&quot; for his red hair (his more common nickname of &quot;Rusty&quot; has the same origin).

In his first year with the Expos, he played in 158 games, having 166 hits, 89 runs, 29 home runs, 79 RBIs on a .302 batting average with a .426 OBP and a .952 OPS. He walked 110 times while striking out 61 times. He played 156 games (with 152 complete games, a career high) in right field for 1,355.1 innings, having 265 putouts, 16 assists, 10 errors, and two double plays turned for a .966 fielding percentage. He was named to the All-Star Game for the third straight year, although he did not play. He finished in the top ten for the National League in numerous categories, such as 10th in batting average, 4th in OBP, total bases (289, 10th), walks (3rd), but also right field categories putouts (2nd), assists and errors (1st).

The following year, he played 160 games while having 156 hits, 98 runs, 30 home runs (a career high) while batting .274 with a .394 OBP and a .891 OPS. He had 112 walks and 93 strikeouts, both career highs. He played 160 games in right field, having 145 complete games in 156 games (a career high) started for a total of 1,374.2 innings. He had 308 putouts, 14 assists, five errors, four double plays and a .985 fielding percentage. He was named to the All-Star Game for the fourth straight year, having a pinch hit appearance in the third inning, going 0-for-1.

For 1971, he played in all 162 games. He had 186 hits, 94 runs, 19 home runs, 97 RBIs with a .311 batting average, a .392 OBP, and a .874 OPS. He had 74 walks and 42 strikeouts. He appeared in 160 games in right field, starting 156 while having 145 complete games for a total of 1,374.2 inning. He had 308 putouts, 14 assists, five errors, and four double plays for a .985 fielding percentage. He was named to the All-Star Game for the fifth straight time, although he did not play.

The #10 worn by Staub during his first stint in Montreal was the first number retired by the Montreal Expos organization. He is also the franchise&#x27;s career leader in on-base percentage (.402), among players with 2,000 or more plate appearances with the franchise. He is also the first player to have won the Expos Player of the Year award.

In his three full seasons with the team, Staub played in 480 total games, garnering 508 hits and achieving an on-base percentage of .402, the latter of which is a franchise record.

===New York Mets===
After three seasons in Montreal, the New York Mets made a blockbuster trade for Staub in 1972 in exchange for first baseman-outfielder Mike Jorgensen, shortstop Tim Foli, and outfielder Ken Singleton. He was batting .313 for the Mets until June 3 of that year, when he was hit by a pitch from future teammate George Stone of the Atlanta Braves, fracturing his right wrist. He played through the pain for several weeks until X-rays revealed the broken bone. Surgery was required and as a result, he went on the disabled list and didn&#x27;t return to the line-up until September 18, 1972. His missed 90 games.

To make matters worse, on May 11, 1973, he was hit by a pitch, this time from Ramón Hernández of the Pittsburgh Pirates. (Hernández also hit Jerry Grote in the same game, fracturing his forearm). Despite playing with pain due to the injury, he still led the team in RBIs. In the National League Championship Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Staub hit three home runs and had five runs batted in. Game 4 of the NLCS was noteworthy for Staub making two catches, during the latter of which he crashed into the outfield wall. He made an outstanding play defensively, where he robbed Dan Driessen of an extra-base hit in the 11th inning. But while making the catch in right field, Staub crashed into the fence and separated his right shoulder. This incident was the impetus for Major League teams applying padding on the outfield walls at all ball parks. The injury forced Staub out of the lineup for Game 5. The Mets went on to defeat the heavily favored Reds to win the National League Pennant in 5 games. In the World Series the shoulder injury forced Staub out of Game 1, but he was used as a decoy, waiting on deck to pinch hit. He returned to the lineup for Game 2, but because of his injury Staub had to throw underhanded and weakly for the remainder of the World Series. Despite the injury, he batted .423 against the Oakland Athletics including a home run and six runs batted in. For the 1973 postseason he batted .341 with 4 home runs and 11 runs batted in

In 1974 he had an injury-free season and led the Mets in hits, runs batted in, and at bats. He played in 151 games, having 145 hits, 65 runs, 19 home runs, 78 RBIs with a .258 batting average, a .347 OBP, and a .754 OPS. He had 77 walks and 39 strikeouts. In 147 games in the right field (with 138 complete games), he had 1,292.1 innings while having 262 putouts, 19 assists, with five errors and double plays each for a .983 fielding percentage.

In 1975, he set a Mets record with 105 runs batted in—the first Met player to surpass 100 RBIs—which was not matched until 1986, when it was tied by Gary Carter, and not surpassed until 1990 when Darryl Strawberry recorded 108.

===Detroit Tigers===
He was traded with Bill Laxton to the Detroit Tigers for Mickey Lolich and Billy Baldwin on December 12, 1975. The transaction was delayed by Lolich who had exercised his right to veto which he earned as a major leaguer for at least ten years with the last five on the same ballclub, a benefit for which Staub had been a year away from qualifying.

In his three plus seasons with the Tigers, Staub hit .277 with 70 home runs and 358 runs batted in. He was voted to start the 1976 All-Star Game, where he went 2-for-2.

In 1978, Staub became the first player to play in all 162 regular-season games exclusively as a designated hitter. Not playing the field at all proved beneficial, as Staub finished second in the Major Leagues with 121 RBI and finished fifth in American League Most Valuable Player voting. He was selected to the &quot;Sporting News&quot; American League All-Star team at the end of the season as the designated hitter.

Staub held out to start the 1979 season. In the 1979 season, he played for the Tigers in 68 games, getting 246 at-bats with 58 hits, 9 home runs and 40 RBIs on a .236 batting average before being traded to the Montreal Expos on July 20 for a player to be named later and cash, with Randall Schafer being sent to complete the trade. He played in 38 games with the Expos, getting 23 hits along with three home runs and 14 RBIs on a .267 batting average. On March 31, 1980, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for Chris Smith and La Rue Washington.

===Later career===
In 1980, Staub played 109 games with the Rangers, with 102 hits in 388 plate appearances while having nine home runs and 55 RBIs for a .300 batting average (which was his first since 1971). He was granted free agency on October 23, 1980, and he signed with the New York Mets on December 16. The Mets immediately reduced him to a part time player and coach, never allowing him to be an everyday player again. Although still a productive hitter, and well on his way to achieving the 3000-hit milestone, he spent the last years of his career mostly sitting on the bench. This ended his ability to be a star player and reaching 3000 hits. But in 1983, he tied a National League record with eight straight pinch-hits and tied the Major League record of 25 RBIs by a pinch hitter. In his final five seasons with the Mets, he played in a combined total of 418 games (with 112 in 1982 being his most), making 702 plate appearances while hitting successfully 169 times and getting 13 home runs and 102 RBIs with a .276 batting average. Fittingly, his final game on October 6, 1985, was against the Expos, pinch hitting for Ronn Reynolds in the bottom of the ninth inning. In his last plate appearance, he grounded out to end the game.

==Retirement and honors==
Staub&#x27;s career ended at the age of 41 in 1985. He was only 284 hits shy of the 3,000 hit milestone. He is the only major league player to have 500 hits with four different teams. He, Ty Cobb, Alex Rodriguez and Gary Sheffield share the distinction of being the only players to hit home runs before turning 20 years old, and after turning 40 years old. Staub was on the Hall of Fame ballot for seven years from 1991 to 1997. He never received more than 7.9%, and he dropped off the ballot after receiving 3.8% in 1997.

Staub was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1986; when the Mets won the World Series that year, Staub received a ring from general manager Frank Cashen. In 2004, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Niagara University. Jesuit High School, where Rusty graduated, annually gives the Rusty Staub Award to the leader of the varsity baseball team. In 2006, Staub was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame and six years later, in 2012, he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. On May 26, 2012, the New York Mets featured a Rusty Staub promotional giveaway bobblehead as part of their 50th anniversary celebration.

On April 4, 1986, Staub established the Rusty Staub Foundation to provide educational scholarships for youth and fight hunger.

In 1985, Staub founded the New York Police and Fire Widows&#x27; and Children&#x27;s Benefit Fund, which supports the families of New York City police officers, firefighters, Port Authority police, and emergency medical personnel who were killed in the line of duty. During its first 15 years of existence, the fund raised and distributed $11 million for families of policemen and firefighters killed in the line of duty. Since September 11, 2001, Staub&#x27;s organization has received contributions in excess of $112 million, and it has played a vital role in helping many families affected by the attack. Staub lost his close friend, Frank Brennan, a bond trader with Cantor-Fitzgerald, in the attack. Brennan had helped Staub establish the Rusty Staub Foundation.

Staub went on to work as a television announcer for Mets&#x27; ballgames from 1986 to 1995.

Staub owned and ran two restaurants in Manhattan. Rusty&#x27;s (at 73rd and Third) opened in 1977, and another Rusty&#x27;s on Fifth opened in 1989. The 73rd Street Rusty&#x27;s used to have an annual rib-eating contest, won by Brooke Shields in 1981. Both have since closed.

After his playing career, Staub also served as a goodwill ambassador for the New York Mets and was a vice president for the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, serving as the chairman of the annual Legends for Youth Dinner.

In July 2006, Staub teamed with Mascot Books to publish his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Hello, Mr. Met&quot;.

Staub was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2018.

==Illness and death==
On October 1, 2015, Staub was on a flight from Ireland to the United States when he had a heart attack and went into cardiac arrest. Two doctors were on board, and assisted in resuscitating him. The flight turned around and landed in Shannon Airport, where paramedics continued to administer emergency treatment to Staub, and transported him to University Hospital Limerick.

Staub died on March 29, 2018, three days before his 74th birthday, at the Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, from multiple organ failure. He had been in the hospital for the previous eight weeks, having been admitted for pneumonia, dehydration, and an infection.

<doc id="847177" wikidata="Q4768266" url="?curid=847177" title="Anne Diamond">
<text>Anne Margaret Diamond (born 8 September 1954) is a British journalist, broadcaster, and children&#x27;s health campaigner. She presently hosts the weekend breakfast show on GB News with Stephen Dixon as her co-presenter. She hosted &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; for TV-am and &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot; for BBC One, with Nick Owen. In 2023, she was made an OBE for her service to children&#x27;s health and is the first non-medic to hold the Royal College of Paediatrics College Medal. 

In 1991, following the death of her third son Sebastian, Diamond successfully campaigned for research into cot death. The campaign, which she co-founded, is reported to have cut the UK&#x27;s incidence of cot death from over 2,000 a year to approximately 300.

She has also worked for LBC, Radio Oxford, BBC London, BBC Berkshire, and is a regular columnist for the various UK newspapers. Since 2003, she has made regular appearances on Channel 5&#x27;s topical discussion show &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; and now its successor, &quot;Jeremy Vine&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Diamond was born on 8 September 1954 in Birmingham, Warwickshire. Her parents were of Irish ancestry, although her father was brought up by his mother in Greenock, Scotland after his father went to Canada. She was brought up in Malvern, Worcestershire, and she attended Worcester Grammar School for Girls.

Diamond worked at a Butlins holiday camp as a redcoat and chalet-maid. She then began her career as a journalist on the &quot;Bridgwater Mercury&quot; and &quot;Bournemouth Evening Echo.&quot;

==Career==
===Television===
Diamond began her television career with BBC West in Bristol, before moving over to &quot;ATV Today&quot; as a reporter and newsreader in 1979. When ATV became Central Television in 1982, she was paired up with Nick Owen, to present the new East Midlands edition of &quot;Central News&quot;. The launch of the Nottingham-based service was initially delayed for a month, but then postponed indefinitely. With no end in sight to the dispute, Diamond left to join ITN before re-joining the BBC, becoming a reporter on the nightly programme &quot;Nationwide&quot; and a presenter on BBC &quot;News After Noon&quot;.

On Monday 6 June 1983, Diamond joined TV-am. Greg Dyke, the newly appointed programme director, spoke with Nick Owen about replacements for sacked presenters Anna Ford and Angela Rippon. Owen suggested Diamond, and later that evening they met in a pub. Six weeks later Diamond joined the station.

Diamond left TV-am in 1990, to work full-time on &quot;TV Weekly&quot;, first produced by TVS and later by Topical Television, which she had presented since 1989. The programme looked behind the scenes of various television programmes and interviewed various personalities from in front and behind the camera. Diamond was rejoined with Nick Owen to present the BBC daytime show &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot;, which ran four years against ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; from 1992 till 1996.

In 2002, Diamond took part in the second series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, and was the second person to be evicted.

In 2003 Diamond became a regular panellist and stand-in presenter on &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;, and from 2018 on its successor &quot;Jeremy Vine&quot;. On occasion Diamond’s role on the show has caused confusion with one caller believing her to be a fish and chip shop owner and subsequently proceeded to attempt to place an order. 

During 2008, Diamond became involved in co-developing a jewellery range, which she marketed on shopping channel QVC under her own name brand. She joined ITV&#x27;s lunchtime chat show &quot;Loose Women&quot; as a regular panellist on 14 October 2016 after impressing bosses when she previously appeared the week before as a guest. She departed the show in August 2018, in line with her new role as the sole stand-in presenter for Jeremy Vine. In 2018, she appeared in Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Costa Del Celebrity&quot;.

Diamond was a regular reviewer of the newspapers for Sky News on Sunday mornings.

In 2022, Diamond joined GB News to host the weekend breakfast show with Stephen Dixon.

===Radio===
In the late 1990s, she presented the breakfast show on the London radio station LBC, variously with Nicholas Lloyd and Tommy Boyd. After a few months presenting her own lunchtime show in 1999, she left the station.

In 2001, she spent a week on &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;, and was welcomed back in 2003 after &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; and has been there to the present day. In 2002, she also returned to television, appearing in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. In October 2004, she joined BBC Radio Oxford, presenting the weekday breakfast programme. In 2006, she left BBC Radio Oxford, presenting her last breakfast programme on 17 March 2006, her replacement being Sybil Ruscoe. Much had been made on the breakfast programme of &quot;Diamond&#x27;s Dieting Buddies&quot;, a scheme whereby Diamond and listeners to the station in 2006 who wanted to lose weight would give one another moral support.

Diamond presented the mid-morning programme on BBC Radio Berkshire and kept a regular blog on the BBC website until 2015.

===Pantomime===
Diamond has appeared in pantomimes including playing the Wicked Queen in &quot;Snow White&quot; at Stoke-on-Trent in 2005, alongside Ken Morley and Sooty. She said that she thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

==Campaigning==
===Cot death===
Diamond became involved in raising awareness of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS, also known as &quot;cot death&quot;), after her son Sebastian died from the syndrome in 1991. She fronted &quot;Back to Sleep&quot;, a campaign telling parents to ensure that babies slept on their backs. Since then incidents of SIDS in the United Kingdom fell from more than 2,000 per year to around 300, a drop which has been attributed to the campaign. Diamond was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the only time it had been awarded to a non-medic.

Diamond spoke out over the cot death and baby-swap storyline in the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, featuring characters Kat Moon and Ronnie Branning. &quot;I think it&#x27;s crass what they&#x27;ve done,&quot; she told ITV&#x27;s &quot;Daybreak&quot; breakfast programme, calling the plot &quot;tacky sensationalism&quot;. There were many complaints about the episode after it was broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

FSID named Diamond as their Anniversary Patron for their 40th anniversary in 2011.

===Video game violence===
On 28 March 2008, in an article for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; tabloid newspaper, Diamond contributed to an article concerning violence in video games where she is quoted as saying that the game &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be sold, even to adults&quot;.

===Leveson Inquiry===
Diamond has been featured in numerous stories in the British tabloid press since the mid-1980s. On 28 November 2011, she gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practice and ethics of the press. She gave detailed accounts of intrusion by journalists into her life and her dealings with tabloid newspapers.

==Honours==
Diamond was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to public health and charity.

She is the first non-medic to be awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.

==Personal life==
Diamond began an affair with Mike Hollingsworth in the mid-1980s while he was married to his first wife. They married in 1989 following the birth of their second child, and went on to have three more children together. Their third child, Sebastian, died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) when he was three months old. Diamond and Hollingsworth separated in 1998 after he had numerous affairs, and divorced in 1999.

Diamond is a railway modeller.

In June 2023, Diamond announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. As part of her treatment, she underwent a double mastectomy and was having &quot;intensive radiotherapy&quot;.

<text>60 Squadron SAAF is a squadron of the South African Air Force. It is a transport, aerial refuelling and EW(electronic warfare)/ELINT(electronic intelligence) squadron. It was first formed at Nairobi in December 1940.

In 1943 the 60th Squadron was a part of the North African Photo Reconnaissance Wing, which later became the Mediterranean Allied Photo Reconnaissance Wing. In several flights during 1944 Mosquitos took many of the later discussed pictures of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camps, in which the Holocaust was visible but was not recognized.

During its first years the squadron flew the British Aircraft Double Eagle, Martin Maryland, de Havilland Mosquito, and the Lockheed Ventura. The squadron was reequipped with Boeing 707s in 1986.

While it was based for a long period at AFB Waterkloof, Pretoria, due to ongoing runway and taxiway repairs at that base, the squadron operated temporarily for a period out of Johannesburg International Airport.

Operations wound down with the last operational Boeing 707 flight flown on 10 July 2007 to Bujumbura, Kinshasa and Kindu. The squadron appears to be in limbo, with conversion to the Airbus A400M Atlas cancelled.

<text>85 Combat Flying School is a unit of the South African Air Force (SAAF). It is a jet flight-training and combat operations school, it was first formed in 1982 at AFB Pietersburg (It was known as Advanced Flying School from 1967). It relocated to AFB Hoedspruit on 1 January 1993 due to the closure of AFB Pietersburg. The school also has a wartime reserve role, although it has publicly been stated that the school will not be used operationally unless a very urgent need arises.

Aircraft used previously :
*Mirage IIIEZ/DZ/D2Z
*Canadair Sabre Mk.6 1975 - 1980
*Atlas Impala Mk.I/II 1972 - 2005

The school has been relocated to AFB Makhado from AFB Hoedspruit into a new purpose-built facility with state-of-the-art computer-aided flight training instruments. The school shares this facility with the SAAF Gripen community.

During October 2007 there were several pilots that went solo on the Hawk Mk.120.

The squadron also participated in the annual South Africa National Defence Force preparation exercises and fired live cannon rounds and dropped live bombs. They also had a successful weapons deployment exercise to AFB Bloemspruit in 2007.

<text>Three Cliffs Bay () (), otherwise Three Cliff Bay, is a bay on the south coast of the Gower Peninsula in the City and County of Swansea, Wales. The bay takes its name from the three sea cliffs that jut out into the bay. Pennard Pill, a large stream, flows into the sea in the middle of the bay.

The beach is an important asset for locals and visitors and routinely qualifies for Blue Flag status. Dogs are allowed on the beach all year.

Inland about from the main beach on high ground above Pennard Pill is Pennard Castle. It was built in the early 12th century, and is imbued with legends of fairies. It is also the only locality in Britain known for yellow whitlow grass (&quot;Draba aizoides&quot;).

Individual beaches that make up this bay have their own names, including Pobbles Bay to the east of the Three Cliffs, and Tor Bay to the west. The beaches are separated at high tide but are accessible to each other at low tide on foot over the sands. Paths lead north to Pennard Burrows, east to Pobbles, and west to Tor Bay. Pobbles and Tor Bay are also accessible from the beach at low tide.
Three Cliffs Bay is effectively part of the inlet of Oxwich Bay. At low tide, Three Cliffs Bay forms a continuous sandy beach with Oxwich Bay beach to the west. They only exist as separate beaches at high tide.

The sea cliffs are limestone, about high, and are a popular destination for rock climbers with 20 climbs in the lower grades, including Scavenger (VS 4b) - often considered a national classic. The largest of the Three Cliffs is easily climbed if approached from the grassy base.

In June 2006 the BBC &quot;Holidays at Home&quot; programme declared Three Cliffs Bay to be the best beach in the United Kingdom.
In a similar programme broadcast on ITV the following year, the view over Three Cliffs Bay was nominated for &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best View&quot;.

Three Cliffs Bay appears in a music video for Red Hot Chili Peppers made by Swansea film company, Studio8. It was used in the opening titles of the 80&#x27;s TV sitcom &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; featuring Richard O&#x27;Sullivan and Joanne Ridley.

Three Cliffs Bay has been used in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Skins&quot; and was shown in an ITV advert: &#x27;The Brighter Side&#x27;.

<doc id="847210" wikidata="Q234056" url="?curid=847210" title="Kohima">
<text>Kohima (; Tenyidie: Kewhira ()) is the capital of the North East Indian state of Nagaland. With a resident population of almost 100,000, it is the second largest city in the state. Kohima constitutes both a district and a municipality. The municipality covers . The city lies on the foothills of Japfü section of the Barail Range located south of the District () and has an average elevation of .

Originally known as Kewhira, Kohima&#x27;s history goes back to a time when it was a village of the Angami Nagas. It became an urban centre in 1878 when the British Empire established its headquarters of the then Naga Hills District of Assam Province. It officially became the capital after the state of Nagaland was inaugurated in 1963. Kohima was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. The battle is often referred to as the &quot;Stalingrad of the East&quot;. In 2013, the British National Army Museum voted the Battle of Kohima to be &quot;Britain&#x27;s Greatest Battle&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Kohima was originally known as &quot;Kewhi–ra&quot;. People from different places and directions came in search of a place to settle down and formed a homogenous group that necessitated the establishment of a village. They named it Kewhira which is derived from the Angami word &quot;kephfükewhi&quot; which means to &quot;meet and assemble together&quot; and &quot;ra&quot; means &quot;village&quot; with its area jurisdiction. The people of &quot;Kewhira&quot; are called &quot;Kewhimia&quot; (&quot;mia&quot; means people) who are the indigenous inhabitants and hereditarily owned the land of &quot;Kewhira&quot;.

== History ==
=== Medieval era ===
According to oral history, the historical founder of Kewhira (Kohima Village) was &quot;Tsiera&quot; (stone defender). The village is said to be more than 700 years old and is believed to be the second largest village in Asia. The village is divided into four large clans (&quot;thinuo&quot;): &quot;Tsütuonuomia&quot;, &quot;Lhisemia&quot;, &quot;Dapfhütsumia&quot; and &quot;Pfüchatsumia&quot; (T, L, D, and P Khel respectively).

=== Colonial era ===
The East India Company Administration started to expand into Kohima beginning the 1840s. The progress made by the company armies in annexing the region continued after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, although now under the auspices of the British Indian Army. Kohima was the first seat of modern administration as the Headquarters of Naga Hills District (then under Assam Province) with the appointment of Guybon Henry Damant as Political Officer in 1879.

=== Battle of Kohima ===

In 1944 during the Second World War the Battle of Kohima along with the simultaneous Battle of Imphal was the turning point in the Burma Campaign. For the first time in South-East Asia, the Japanese lost the initiative to the Allies, which the Allies then retained until the end of the war. This hand-to-hand battle and slaughter prevented the Japanese Army from gaining a base from which they might have easily gone into the plains of India.

Kohima has a large cemetery known as the Kohima War Cemetery for the Allied war dead; it is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The cemetery lies on the slopes of Garrison Hill, in what was once the Deputy Commissioner&#x27;s tennis court, which was the scene of intense fighting known as the Battle of the Tennis Court. The epitaph carved on the memorial of the 2nd British Division in the cemetery has become world-famous as the Kohima poem.

Recognized by the District Commissioner, ward panchayats oversee peaceful community coexistence, resolve disputes, and communicate community concerns to the government. GBs manage house tax collection due to their familiarity with households. These traditional bodies are integral to development work within their wards and hold meetings as needed.

<text>The Test Flight and Development Centre is a unit of the South African Air Force. It is a test flight and evaluation organisation.

Due to South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies of the 1960s, a number of countries instituted an arms boycott against it. This forced the SAAF to create an indigenous flight testing and development capability to research new technologies and methods and update old ones, and in this light a former graduate of the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School (ETPS) was appointed the SAAF&#x27;s Chief Test Pilot in 1967 and tasked with improving and expanding the air force&#x27;s test flying and evaluation capabilities. In 1974 another ETPS graduate took over, and was tasked with creating a specialised test flying and evaluation unit within the SAAF. The result was that the Test Flight and Development Centre was officially established on 10 August 1975 at AFB Waterkloof.

Over the next few years until the imposition of the mandatory United Nations arms embargo against South Africa in 1977, additional pilots were sent to the ETPS and to EPNER in France to gain flight test experience and expertise.
By 1979, the TFDC had grown large enough to merit the allocation of one of the hangar complexes at AFB Waterkloof, and in 1980 it established a satellite unit at Van Ryneveld Airfield in Upington to conduct weapons release tests. Once the Denel Overberg Test Range near Bredasdorp on the southern Cape coast had been completed, the TFDC moved to an adjacent airfield, now known as AFB Overberg.

==Aircraft Fleet==
As of July 2011 TFDC&#x27;s permanent fleet consists of: 
*1x Agusta 109 LUH - #4006
*1x SAAB Gripen D - #3901
*1x BAe Hawk - #250
*1x Atlas Oryx - #1200

Other aircraft are operated on temporary detachment from squadrons as well as manufacturers such as Denel.

==Projects==
===Hawk trainer===
The TFDC&#x27;s largest running project was the operational evaluation of the BAe Hawk Mk.120 and certification of its Adour 951 turbofan engine. Weapons integration was also performed, with the SAAF&#x27;s series of pre-fragmented bombs. The programme is now largely complete, with one Hawk airframe remaining on strength with TFDC, for further tests. Hawk has entered SAAF service as of 2006.

===Taurus missile===
In 2001 and 2002 it assisted the German Air Force in the testing of the Taurus stand-off missile, for which two Panavia Tornado aircraft deployed a number of times to AFB Overberg from Germany with the help of a SAAF Boeing 707 aerial tanker.
In 2009 the Spanish Air Force performed integration tests of the Taurus missile on their F-18 Hornet fighters at TFDC.

===Gripen===
The TFDC received the SAAF&#x27;s first JAS 39 Gripen in 2006. The aircraft is flown through an extensive test programme, integrating weapons and SAAF specific avionics etc. During November 2007, the Gripen was shown publicly taking off loaded with eight &#x27;dumb&#x27; bombs during weapons integration trials.

===Luftwaffe Kormoran Anti Ship missile firings===
During 2006 the German Air Force deployed six Panavia Tornado aircraft to TFDC for live Kormoran anti ship missile firings with a German Navy task group in joint exercises with South African forces.

<doc id="847217" wikidata="Q1088550" url="?curid=847217" title="Fear of Flying (novel)">
<text>Fear of Flying is a 1973 novel by Erica Jong. It became controversial for its portrayal of female sexuality, and figured in the development of second-wave feminism.

The novel is written in the first person, narrated by its protagonist, Isadora Zelda White Stollerman Wing, a 29-year-old poet who has published two books of poetry. On a trip to Vienna with her second husband, Isadora decides to indulge her sexual fantasies with another man.

The novel&#x27;s tone may be considered conversational or informal. The story&#x27;s American narrator is struggling to find her place in the world of academia, feminist scholarship, and in the literary world as a whole. The narrator is a female author of erotic poetry, which she publishes without fully realizing how much attention she will attract from both critics and writers of alarming fan letters.

The book resonated with women who felt stuck in unfulfilling marriages, and it has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.

==Plot==
Isadora Wing is a Jewish journalist from New York City. She and her husband Bennett fly to Vienna for the first psychoanalysts&#x27; conference since analysts were driven out during the Holocaust. She associates her fear of flying, both literally and metaphorically referring to a fear of freeing herself from the shackles of traditional male companionship, with recent articles about plane hijackings and terrorist attacks. She also associates fear and loathing with Germany, because she and her husband were stationed in Heidelberg and she struggled both to fit in and to wrestle with the hatred and danger she felt being a Jew in post-Holocaust Germany. Isadora ponders many questions, plans, mental rough drafts and reminiscences as her journey unfolds, including the &quot;zipless fuck,&quot; a major motif in the story that haunts the narrator throughout.

Upon arriving, Isadora meets the English Langsian analyst Adrian Goodlove and is immediately smitten. Despite his gruff attitude and poor sexual performance, he seems to provide what she desires but does not find in her own marriage: energy, excitement, desire, danger. They begin a poorly-veiled affair by dancing and kissing rather openly at conference events, staying out nights, and spending days by German pools. Isadora&#x27;s desperation to feel alive and her developing feelings for Adrian lead her to the toughest decision: to return home with Bennett or to go to London with Adrian. She agonizes over the decision. One night, Bennett finds Adrian and Isadora in bed together and joins them in an adventurous sexual act that Bennett never acknowledges afterward.

Finally, through an emotionally taxing and melodramatic letter that she never delivers to Bennett because he once again walks in and interrupts her, Isadora decides to leave with Adrian. The two of them drive through France, Germany, and Italy camping every night, drinking, and making love. Along the way, Isadora confides in Adrian the stories of her past relationships and first marriage. She reveals that she met her first husband, Brian, in college, where they connected over their mutual love of literature and ability to walk for hours while quoting poetry. They gradually became distant and Brian began to fall into delusions, believing himself to be the second coming of Christ. He became violent, raped Isadora, and choked her close to death in one mental break. He was repeatedly hospitalized and eventually moved to an asylum in Los Angeles in which Brian blamed her for everything, and they finally divorced.

Eventually, Adrian reveals that he has plans to meet his ex-wife and his children, leading Isadora to return home to Bennett. On a train journey to meet him in London, she is approached by an attendant who sexually assaults her, which propels her into her own psychological self-examination.

She realizes that when she is not in control of her body and does not have agency or autonomy, it does not matter how much she has dreamed of a situation, but it will never be satisfying. When she returns home, she takes a bath; waits for Bennett; and comes to accept her body, herself, and the unknown future: &quot;A nice body. Mine. I decided to keep it&quot; (p. 424).

==The zipless fuck==
It was in this novel that Erica Jong coined the term &quot;zipless fuck&quot;, which soon entered the popular lexicon. A &quot;zipless fuck&quot; is defined as a sexual encounter for its own sake, without emotional involvement or commitment or any ulterior motive, between two previously unacquainted persons.

Jong goes on to explain that it is &quot;zipless&quot; because &quot;when you came together, zippers fell away like rose petals, underwear blew off in one breath like dandelion fluff. For the true ultimate zipless A-1 fuck, it was necessary that you never got to know the man very well.&quot;

==Feminist influences then and now==
&quot;Fear of Flying&quot; was written in the throes of the Sexual Revolution of the 1970s, as associated with second-wave feminism. Finally, it was acknowledged that desire and fantasy are good things and not entirely condemnable in women, and Jong wanted to harness that newfound respect for desire into a piece of art that brought the intersections of sexual and nonsexual life together, which she felt was missing in literature. &quot;At the time I wrote &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, there was not a book that said women are romantic, women are intellectual, women are sexual—and brought all those things together.&quot; &quot;What [Isadora is] looking for is how to be a whole human being, a body and a mind, and that is what women were newly aware they needed in 1973.&quot; However, she also points out the drawbacks of a sexually liberated life and acknowledges that sexuality &quot;is not the cure for every restlessness.&quot; Male critics who interpreted Isadora as being &quot;promiscuous&quot; were actually misinterpreting her acts since she has an active fantasy life but does not really sleep with many men. This does, however, allude to the possibility that other charming men can bring a women&#x27;s fantasies to life, hence promiscuity is there, just not realized. 

Jong says that today, women are no longer shocked by Isadora&#x27;s sexuality and the depiction of sex and fantasy, but readers were when the book was first released. Instead, she sees that book mirrors the lack of pleasure that many young women experience in sexual interactions. She cites the TV show &quot;Girls&quot; as an example of media depicting sexually-liberated women but without attention to female pleasure. Just like Isadora, the women on television and alive today struggle to reconcile the empowerment of sexual freedom with the disempowerment of sex without pleasure. However, she also sees growth in the female population that live alone and &quot;whose lives are full with friends, travel, work, everything and who don’t feel that in some way they&#x27;re inferior because they don’t have a man at their side&quot; as being one extremely positive result of the way sexual liberation has transformed over the decades.

The political battle over women&#x27;s bodies today has also renewed the book&#x27;s relevance in Jong&#x27;s mind, constituting a 40th anniversary redistribution of the book. &quot;All these states are introducing crazy anti-abortion rules... passing laws that they know are unconstitutional, shutting down Planned Parenthood clinics, and making it very hard...to get birth control.&quot; She cites those types of political moves as a regression from the progress set out by the Sexual Revolution. She also still feels that female authors are &quot;second-class citizens in the publishing world,&quot; as Jennifer Weiner says in the introduction to the 40th anniversary edition: &quot;it&#x27;s very hard, if you write about women and women&#x27;s struggles, to be seen as important with a capital &#x27;I&#x27;.&quot;

== Character models ==
Jong denies that the novel is autobiographical but admits that it has autobiographical elements. However, an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; recounts that Jong&#x27;s sister, Suzanna Daou (née Mann), identified herself at a 2008 conference as the reluctant model for Isadora Wing&#x27;s sister Randy and called the book &quot;an exposé of my life when I was living in Lebanon.&quot; Daou angrily denounced the book, linked its characters to people in her own life, and took her sister to task for taking cruel liberties with them, especially Daou&#x27;s husband. In the book, Isadora Wing&#x27;s sister Randy is married to Pierre, who makes a pass at both Wing and her two other sisters. Jong dismissed her sister&#x27;s claim by saying instead that &quot;every intelligent family has an insane member.&quot;

==Film and radio adaptations==
Many attempts to adapt this property for Hollywood have been made, starting with Julia Phillips, who fantasized that it would be her debut as a director, from a screenplay by David Giler. The deal fell through and Erica Jong litigated, unsuccessfully. In her second novel, Jong created the character Britt Goldstein, a predatory and self-absorbed Hollywood producer devoid of both talent and scruples.

In May 2013 it was announced that a screenplay version by Piers Ashworth had been green-lit by Blue-Sky Media, with Laurie Collyer directing.

<text>Before the Holocaust, Jews were a significant part of the population in Lithuania where they numbered around 240,000, including approximately 100,000 in Vilnius, or about 45% of that city&#x27;s pre-World War II population (Vilnius was also once known as the &quot;Jerusalem of Lithuania&quot;). A large Jewish community also existed in Latvia. In comparison, Estonia and the Nordic countries have had much smaller communities, concentrated mostly in Denmark and Sweden.

<text>S-VT, or Sequential Valve Timing, is an automobile variable valve timing technology developed by Mazda. S-VT varies the timing of the intake valves by using hydraulic pressure to rotate the camshaft. S-VT was introduced in 1998 on the ZL-VE engine and is used in the B-, Z-, MZR- and J-families of engines.

<doc id="847246" wikidata="Q6647290" url="?curid=847246" title="Lisvane">
<text>Lisvane () is a community in the north of Cardiff, the capital of Wales, located north of the city centre. Lisvane is generally considered to be one of the wealthiest residential areas of Wales, with many properties worth in excess of £1 million. Lisvane had 3,319 residents in 2001 and has about 1,700 dwellings, a local village shop, primary school, community cabin library, park, nursery, parish church, public house, war memorial, Scout hall and community or village hall.

==History==

===Early history===
The Welsh language name Llys-faen means &#x27;Stone Court&#x27; (&quot;llys&quot; – court and &quot;maen&quot;, mutated to &quot;faen&quot; – stone). There have been several alternative spellings in the English language over the centuries, such as Lysvayen, Lucyvene, Llisuine, Lyssefayn, Lysfayn, Lucyvine, Lucyvenye, Lucyveny, Leysvayen, Les Ffayne and Lliffeni. The village probably settled on the present name from around 1630.
Each early Welsh kingdom was divided into lesser administrative units, &quot;cantrefi&quot;, which were further subdivided into &quot;cymydau&quot; (commotes). In each commote the royal taxation house was a large building made almost certainly of stone because it had to be permanent, weather proof and thief proof. The commote of Cibbwr/Kibbor was on land between Cefn Onn ridge and the coast, and most historians agree that Llys-faen was its administrative centre, although Roath has also staked a claim. There is now no indication of the actual whereabouts of the Llys Faen or Stone Court, although various theories have been advanced.

The earthworks at Graig Llwyn is held to be the oldest artificial feature in Lisvane, proposed by several archaeologists to be the remains of an Iron Age stronghold. No definite date or purpose can yet be confirmed for this earthwork.

At the start of the 13th century the parish lands of Llanishen and Lisvane had been divided into Norman manors that were expected to provide food for the castle garrison at Cardiff. The southern facing slopes of the ridge above Lisvane with their rich agricultural land soon became the grain growing area for the supplies which were transported to Roath Mill for processing.
There is a local legend that Oliver Cromwell once stayed at the Black Griffin Inn, prior to the Battle of St Fagans in May 1648 and that the Cromwell family once lived there briefly. There is no evidence to support this, though Cromwell must have lodged somewhere, but it is more likely that the inn&#x27;s only Cromwellian association is with soldiers of Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army. Cromwell was, however, of Welsh ancestry (his real name was Williams) and his great-grandfather came from this area.

===The Tŷ Mawr===
Tŷ Mawr is a historic house on the Graig slope overlooking the village. It was built as a farmhouse in the 18th to early 19th centuries and was in the estate of the Lewis family. In 1900 part of the estate was let to Lisvane Golf Club, which established a 9-hole course there; but two years later, the club moved to Radyr, taking the clubhouse with them. From just after the Second World War, the fox hounds of the local Lisvane Hunt were kennelled at Tŷ Mawr until it became a public house in the 1960s.

The Llanishen and Lisvane Hunt had several homes over the years, with the hunts most recently setting off from Llan Farm on Graig Llwyn Road. The village hunt disbanded around 1997 on the death of the hunt&#x27;s Master.

There is a local tradition that for a period during the 1800s, Erw-wen, on Rudry Road, was also a pub or beer house, possibly called the Red Cow, although no documentary proof has been found.

===Lisvane and the Cold War===
A few yards away from the Ordnance Survey&#x27;s triangulation point on the Graig stands Lisvane&#x27;s only Cold War nuclear bunker. During World War II the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) observation post stood on the Graig with its clear views over the village and the city of Cardiff. The volunteer ROC observers spotted many German Luftwaffe raids approaching across the channel and activated the air raid warnings in the Cardiff area. In early 1966 a protected nuclear fallout shelter (or bunker) was completed on the site for the ROC (at OS Grid Ref: ST 1898 8508); by the 1960s they had switched from above ground aircraft spotting to underground operations with instruments to detect nuclear explosions and warn the public of approaching radioactive fallout in the event of nuclear war.

The only time observers were mobilised, and volunteers spent nearly ten days underground, was during the Cuban Missile Crisis as the government prepared the country for the potential outbreak of war. The Lisvane nuclear bunker was abandoned by the ROC in 1991 when the Corps itself was disbanded with the end of the Cold War and as a result of recommendations in the government&#x27;s Options for Change review of UK defence. The Lisvane nuclear bunker still exists, but it was purchased by a mobile phone communications company who built a radio mast inside the fenced compound and sited some of their equipment in the underground facility.

===Notable domestic architecture===
Several properties in Lisvane are listed for their historical and architectural significance by Cadw. Tŷ Gwyn on Lisvane Road was built as the personal residence of builder James E. Turner of E. Turner and Sons and is listed Grade II. The firm was responsible for much of the construction of Cardiff&#x27;s Cathays Park civic centre. It was latterly the home of financier Julian Hodge. Lisvane House on Mill Road was built in the Arts and Crafts style by architect Edwin Seward. The Dingle is toward the upper end of Mill Road. It was designed by Percy Thomas, and is also listed Grade II.

==Governance==
===Community Council===
The village has an elected community council which is funded by a precept on council tax bills in the local area. It provides support to a number of community services. The council currently has ten councillors (9 Independent, 1 Conservative) with elections held every five years. The last election was held at the same time as the 2017 Cardiff Council election and the next election is due in May 2022.

===Cardiff Council ward===
Since 1999 the electoral ward of Lisvane has elected one councillor to Cardiff Council, namely David Walker for the Conservative Party. Before 1999, Lisvane was, with St Mellons and Pontprennau, part of the ward of Lisvane and St Mellons, which elected a single councillor to Cardiff Council. At the 1995 election, Lisvane and St Mellons was the only ward in Cardiff to elect a Conservative councillor. By 1999, the growth of Pontprennau led to the establishment of a separate ward of Pontprennau and Old St. Mellons, which elects two councillors, and Lisvane became a ward on its own.

The ward was bounded by those of Caerphilly county borough to the north; Pontprennau &amp; Old St. Mellons to the east; Pentwyn to the southeast; Llanishen and Cyncoed to the south; and Rhiwbina to the west.

Following a boundary review and a projected population increase, the new community of Thornhill will be transferred from the Llanishen ward to Lisvane, effective from the 2022 Cardiff Council election. The ward will be renamed &quot;Lisvane and Thornhill&quot; and elect three councillors.

===Senedd===

The Senedd representative for Cardiff North is Welsh Labour MS Julie Morgan.

===Westminster===
Lisvane lies within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff North, which has been represented since 2017 by Anna McMorrin (Labour).

==Geography==
===Geological structure===
The surrounding soils are mostly a strong, brown, dry earth, well adapted for arable farming and the growing of grains of all kinds that contributed to the area being a mostly farming community until the modern era. Soils were further enriched over the millennia by alluvial deposits from the meandering River Taff and other smaller tributaries. The substratum under the whole area is a limestone and lime shale that was likely laid down under a warm ocean at some stage in the distant past and subsequently ground down by glaciers during the last ice age around 18,000 years ago.

===M4 motorway===
The neighbouring suburbs are Llanishen to the south, Thornhill to the west, Pontprennau to the east, and Lisvane&#x27;s effective northern border is the M4 motorway. The M4 corridor around Cardiff was announced in 1971 as a replacement for a northern link road that had been proposed since 1947 but never built. The northern &#x27;Lisvane route&#x27; for the M4 was eventually chosen after a number of public enquiries and objections from village residents. The new motorway was completed and opened in July 1980.

===The Graig===
The Graig is a hill situated north of Lisvane. It borders on Caerphilly. There is also a quarry near the Graig which is now abandoned. The Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk runs along the top of the Graig, and has some very good walks and mountain biking routes. Particular favourites for locals include routes to the east to Rudry and the Maenllwyd Inn, and to the west to Caerphilly mountain, The Travellers Rest, and further on to Tongwynlais, Castell Coch and the Taff Trail.

==Demography==
The United Kingdom Census 2011 showed that the total population of Lisvane was 3,707. The average age was 44.6 years old and 69% of the adult population were married.

Of the 3,707 total, children under the age of 19 accounted for 864 and people over the age of 65 totalled 866.

1,515 were in full-time employment, and 188 of those worked exclusively from home. Of those that travelled to their place of employment 1,090 drove by private car, 74 travelled by train and 43 by bus, 34 walked, 9 cycled and 77 travelled as passengers in other vehicles.

The White population accounted for 92.6% of the residents; of the remainder 4.2% were Asian, 0.5% Chinese, 1.5% were of mixed race and 0.2% were Black.

==Economy==
There are little in the way of major employers in the village. The area still has a predominantly farming economy. Some local employment is provided by the service industries of the shops and public houses. The general affluence in the village is mainly drawn from employment in the commerce and industry centre of the capital city. An increasing number of employees are working from home via high speed internet links and telephone.

Following improvements in the road and rail infrastructure some Lisvane residents commute daily to work in Bristol or London.

==Education==
Corpus Christi High School is the only secondary school located within Lisvane, just on its boundary with the ward of Cyncoed. However, school age residents fall into the catchment area for Llanishen High School in the ward of Llanishen, which is more accessible.

Llysfaen Primary School serves the local population of 4- to 11-year-olds.

==Religion ==

St Denys&#x27; Church (Church in Wales) in the centre of the village was built in the 12th century and remodelled several times since. The listed building is notable for the imposing and unusual tower with a pitched roof but lacks the normal Norman castellations.

The first Baptist Chapel in Lisvane was built in 1789 on Chapel Road, now renamed Rudry Road, and only stood for less than thirty years until it had to be rebuilt during 1818. Less than forty years later the foundations of the second church were becoming unsafe and a third chapel was constructed, but by 1910 further renovations and repairs were necessary as it had become dilapidated. Lisvane Baptist church now meets in the Memorial Hall on Heol-y-Delyn Road. Methodist services are also held in the Memorial Hall.

Howell Harris, one of the most famous pioneer Calvinistic Methodist ministers, preached regularly during meetings held at several private houses in Lisvane between 1766 and 1769, just before his death.

==Sports and recreation==
Lisvane Cricket Club was formed in 1976. The club is now based at Llwynarthen in nearby St Mellons. They run 5 adult league sides, with the 1st XI playing in the South East Wales Cricket League Division 1, as well as running youth sides from Under 9 to Under 19.

Lisvane Panthers Junior Football Club fields sides in the under 8 Mini league, the Juniors at 11 – under 16 and an over 16 youth team.

Lisvane Panthers Football Club, home ground Cardiff University pitches in Llanrumney, entered the Lazarou League in 2011. The team won three league and cup doubles (Division 4 in 2012, Division 3 in 2013, Division 2 in 2014) as well as reaching consecutive Lazarou Cup finals in 2013 and 2014.

Lisvane (CAC) Tennis Club is located just north of Lisvane and Thornhill railway station and is the tennis section of the Cardiff Athletic Club.

The nearest rugby union team is in nearby Llanishen.

==Public services and village facilities==

The area is served by Lisvane &amp; Thornhill railway station with services northbound to Rhymney and southbound to Cardiff Central via Cardiff Queen Street.

Cardiff Bus operates services 27 (Thornhill/Birchgrove/Heath/Cathays), 28 (Llanishen/Roath), and 86 (Llanishen/Heath/Gabalfa/Cathays) from Cardiff Central bus station through the area.

There are two pubs in Lisvane; the &quot;Ty Mawr&quot; and the &quot;Black Griffin&quot;, named after the Tredegar House Morgan family&#x27;s arms that featured a &quot;gryphon, sable, segreant&quot;, and only recently returned to its traditional name having been called simply &quot;The Griffin&quot; for many years. There is a third pub called &quot;The Old Cottage&quot; just across the railway line that divides Thornhill and Lisvane.

A kilometre from the centre of the village is &quot;Parc Cefn Onn&quot; or Cefn Onn Country Park, an extensive mixed species arboretum, with lakes and woodland walks. The park was laid out around ninety years ago and planted by the railway manager who lived in a large estate near Cefn Onn Halt, at the time Lisvane&#x27;s tiny &quot;request only&quot; and underused railway station, which closed in 1985 when it was replaced by the current modern railway station closer to the village. Cefn Onn Halt stood a hundred metres away from the railway tunnel that vanishes under Llanishen Golf Club and Caerphilly mountain.

<doc id="847247" wikidata="Q477725" url="?curid=847247" title="Leptictidium">
<text>Leptictidium is an extinct genus of small mammals that were likely bipedal. Comprising eight species, they resembled today&#x27;s bilbies, bandicoots, and elephant shrews, and occupied a similar niche. They are especially interesting for their combination of characteristics typical of primitive eutherians with highly specialized adaptations, such as powerful hind legs and a long tail which aided in locomotion. They were omnivorous, their diet a combination of insects, lizards, frogs, and small mammals. &quot;Leptictidium&quot; and other leptictids are not placentals, but are non-placental eutherians, although they are closely related to placental eutherians. They appeared in the Lower Eocene, a time of warm temperatures and high humidity, roughly fifty million years ago. Although they were widespread throughout Europe, they became extinct around thirty-five million years ago with no descendants, as they were adapted to live in forest ecosystems and were unable to adapt to the open plains of the Oligocene.

== Description ==

&quot;Leptictidium&quot; is a special animal because of the way its anatomy combines quite primitive elements with elements which prove a high degree of specialization. It had small fore legs and large hind legs, especially at the distal side (that further from the body). The lateral phalanges of its forelegs (fingers I and V) were very short and weak, finger III was longer and fingers II and IV were roughly equal in size, and slightly shorter than finger III. The tips of the phalanges were elongated and tapered.

The ankles and the sacroiliac joint were quite loosely fixed, while the pelvis had a flexible joint with only one coccygeal vertebra. The anteorbital muscle fenestrae in their crania suggest they probably had a long and mobile snout (or Proboscis), similar to that of elephant shrews.

&quot;Leptictidium&quot; had wide diastemata in the antemolar row, its upper molar teeth were more transverse than those of the North American leptictids and its fourth premolars were molariform. Its C1 canines were incisiviform. Its dentition was quite small in comparison to the size of the mandible and the animal as a whole.

It varied between in length (more than half of which belonged to the tail), and in height. It weighed a couple of kilograms. These sizes could vary from one specimen to another. &quot;Leptictidium tobieni&quot; from Messel (Germany) is the largest known leptictid with skull long, head with trunk long, and tail long.

===Locomotion===
One of the mysteries about &quot;Leptictidium&quot; is whether it moved by running or by jumping. Because there are very few completely bipedal mammals, it is difficult to find an appropriate living model to compare it with. If the kangaroo is used, it is probable that &quot;Leptictidium&quot; hopped along with its body tilted forward, using its tail as a counterweight. On the other hand, elephant shrews combine both types of locomotion; they usually move on four legs, but they can run on two legs to flee from a predator. Studies of the bone structure of &quot;Leptictidium&quot; have yielded contradicting information: its leg articulations appear too weak to have supported the shock of repeated jumps, but its long feet were obviously adapted for jumping rather than running.

Kenneth D. Rose compared the species &quot;L. nasutum&quot; with the leptictid &quot;Leptictis dakotensis&quot;. &quot;L. dakotensis&quot; had a series of traits which show it was a running animal which sometimes moved by jumping. Despite the marked similarities between &quot;Leptictis&quot; and &quot;Leptictidium&quot;, there are certain differences in their skeletons which prevent the example of &quot;Leptictis&quot; from being used to determine with certainty the way &quot;Leptictidium&quot; moved: the most important being that, unlike &quot;Leptictis&quot;, the tibia and the fibula of &quot;Leptictidium&quot; were not fused together.

==Behaviour==
Perfectly preserved fossils of three different species of &quot;Leptictidium&quot; have been found in the Messel pit in Germany. The marks on their fur have been preserved, as well as their stomach contents, which reveal &quot;Leptictidium&quot; were omnivores which fed on insects, lizards and small mammals. The holotype of &quot;L. tobieni&quot; also had pieces of leaves and notable amounts of sand in its abdomen, but it cannot be determined with certainty if the animal swallowed it.

==Habitat==
&quot;Leptictidium&quot; lived in the European subtropical forests of the Eocene. From the beginning of this period, the temperature of the planet rose in one of the quickest (in geological terms) and most extreme episodes of global warming in the geological record, termed Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. It was an episode of quick and intense (of up to 7 °C in high latitudes) warming which lasted less than 100,000 years. The thermal maximum caused a great extinction which is used to distinguish the Eocene fauna from that of the Paleocene.

The global climate of the Eocene was probably the most homogeneous of the Cenozoic; the temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was half that of today&#x27;s, and the deep ocean currents were exceptionally warm. The polar regions were much warmer than today, possibly as warm as the present-day Pacific Northwest of North America. Temperate forests reached the poles themselves, while rainy tropical climates reached 45° N. The greatest difference was in temperate latitudes; nevertheless, the climate at the tropics was probably similar to today&#x27;s.

In the Eocene, most of what is now Europe, the Mediterranean and south-west Asia was submerged under the Tethys Sea. These two continents were separated by the Turgai Strait (an epeiric sea). Due to high humidity and temperatures, most of the European continent was covered in vegetation.

The region which today is Germany was in a volcanically active zone during the Eocene. It is thought that the Messel pit could have been the old location of a volcanic lake saturated with CO2. The lake would periodically release the gas it contained, creating a lethal cloud which would asphyxiate any animal in its path. This would explain the great number of non-aquatic species which have been found in the old lake-bed of the Messel pit.

In the lush forests of this region, &quot;Leptictidium&quot; shared its habitat with animals such as &quot;Godinotia&quot;, &quot;Pholidocercus&quot;, &quot;Palaeotis,&quot; or &quot;Propalaeotherium&quot;. There were also predators, the crocodilian &quot;Asiatosuchus&quot;, the hyaenodont &quot;Lesmesodon&quot;, and the Messel giant ant.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Leptictidium&quot; includes eight species. These include:

===&quot;Leptictidium auderiense&quot;===
Described by Heinz Tobien in 1962 based on a series of lower jaws from the Lutetian faunal stage. Tobien also uncovered a small skeleton he defined as a paratype of the species, but Storch and Lister proved in 1985 that, in fact, the skeleton did not even belong to the genus &quot;Leptictidium&quot;. It was the smallest species of all and was only sixty centimetres long. Several skeletons have been found at the Messel pit. Mathis remarks the exceptional development of the paraconid (or mesiobucal cusp) of the lower P4 premolar. Its premolars and molars were quite small in comparison to the dentition as a whole. The name of the species refers to the Roman settlement of Auderia.

===&quot;Leptictidium ginsburgi&quot;===
Described by Christian Mathis in 1989. Fossils have been found in the lagerstätte at Robiac, Le Bretou, Lavergne, La Bouffie, Les Clapiès, Malpérié and Perrière (France), in Upper Ludian strata. The mesostyle typical of the genus &quot;Leptictidium&quot; is not developed in this species. The species is dedicated to Léonard Ginsburg, French paleontologist and deputy director of the &quot;Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot; in París.

===&quot;Leptictidium nasutum&quot;===
Described by Adrian Lister and Gerhard Storch in 1985. It was a middle-sized species which was seventy-five centimeters long. Several skeletons have been found in the Messel pit, in Lower Lutetian strata. The tail of this species had 42-43 vertebrae, a number surpassed among mammals solely by the long-tailed pangolin. Its premolar and molar teeth were quite small in comparison to the dentition as a whole. The name of the species refers to the nose of the animal. The holotype is the complete skeleton of an adult specimen kept in the Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg in Frankfurt am Main.

===&quot;Leptictidium sigei&quot;===
Described by Christian Mathis in 1989. Fossils have been found in the lagerstätte at Sainte-Néboule, Baby, Sindou and Pécarel (France), and it has a more primitive appearance than &quot;L. nasutum&quot;. It is known mainly from isolated teeth. It has a P4 with a much reduced paraconid, as well as very distinct entoconids and hypoconulids on M1 and M2. The species is dedicated to Bernard Sigé, French paleontologist.

===&quot;Leptictidium tobieni&quot;===

Described by Wighart von Koenigswald and Gerhard Storch in 1987. It was the largest species of all at ninety centimetres long. It is one of the species found in the Messel pit, in Lutetian strata. The species is dedicated to Heinz Tobien, descriptor of the genus &quot;Leptictidium&quot; and promoter of research in the Messel pit during the 1960s. The holotype is a complete and perfectly preserved skeleton of an adult specimen which was uncovered in September 1984 and which can be found at the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt. There is also a paratype; a non-complete and badly preserved specimen which can be found at the Institut Royal des Sciences Naturelles de Belgique.

It has a relatively robust mandible with a relatively large mesostyle. The molariform premolar teeth are a characteristic of the genus &quot;Leptictidium&quot; as a whole which is very marked in the P4 premolars of &quot;L. tobieni&quot;. The well-developed mesostyle and the transversal configuration of the upper molars are other typical traits of this species.

===Comparison of the Messel species===
By observing the clear morphological differences in the dentition of the three species found in Messel, the possibility can be discarded that either the discovered fossils are specimens of the same species but of different age, or that two of these forms belonged to the same species with a marked sexual dimorphism.

The Messel species developed very quickly a series of characteristic evolutionary traits, common to all of them, which separate them from the lagerstätte of Quercy.

This table compares the size of different specimens of each species found in the Messel pit .

==Evolutionary tendencies==
In his work &quot;Quelques insectivores primitifs nouveaux de l&#x27;Eocène supérieur du sud de la France&quot; (1989), French paleontologist Christian Mathis studied the evolutionary tendencies of the genus &quot;Leptictidium&quot;, based on comparison of the most primitive and the most recent species. From his observations, Mathis remarks:

*an increase in size;
*a precocious merging of the hypoconulid and the entoconid on M3;
*a slight reduction of the width of the talonid on M3 in comparison to the anterior molars;
*the formation and development of a mesostile on the molariform jugal teeth P4-M3;
*the reduction of the parametastylar and metastylar regions of these same teeth (with some exceptions), in particular with a reduction of the parastylar lobe which rises less in the anterior part of M3 and possibly P4;
*a transverse shortening of the upper molarised teeth, which become more square;
*the development of accessory conuli on the preprotocrista and postprotocrista;
*the development of the postcingulum.

<text>Radyr (; ) is an outer suburb of Cardiff, about northwest of Cardiff city centre. Radyr is part of Radyr and Morganstown Community, for which the 2011 Census recorded a population of 6,417.

Morganstown is north of Radyr, on the other side of the M4 Motorway. Neighbouring communities are Whitchurch to the east on the opposite bank of the River Taff, Pentyrch to the west with St Fagans and Llandaff to the south.

==History==
===Stone Age until the Norman Conquest===
Evidence of Stone Age occupation of the Lesser Garth Cave near Morganstown was discovered in 1912 and included worked flints. In 1916 excavation of a mound of in Radyr Woods revealed charcoal and Iron Age pottery. Radyr developed after the Norman invasion of Wales at the start of the 12th century and formed part of the Welsh Lordship or cantref of Miskin under the Lordship of Glamorgan created by the Norman King, William Rufus, in 1093.

===Origin of the name===
Hints about the derivation of the name &quot;Radyr&quot; can be found in Lifris&#x27;s writings &quot;Life of St Cadog&quot;, written between 1081 and 1104 but relating to the earlier period around AD 530, which mentions a croft or &quot;tref&quot; on the site called &quot;Aradur Hen&quot;. Lifris also tells the story of &quot;Tylyway&quot;, a hermit who was held to have lived on the banks of the Taff. Tylyway&#x27;s cell is the most likely origin of the name Radyr; from the Welsh &quot;yr adur&quot;, meaning &quot;the chantry&quot;, although &quot;Arudur Hen&quot; is also possible.

===Norman occupation and Middle Ages===

The Norman motte in the &quot;mound field&quot; is a flat-topped mound in diameter at the base and high, surrounded by a ditch wide. An adjoining bailey to east of the motte could indicate the boundary between Norman and Welsh land. The motte was surrounded by a timber palisade around a wooden keep and formed part of a defensive line with similar mottes at Thornhill and Whitchurch. The early settlement that became Radyr developed around the Norman church and manor house in what is now Danescourt. Surveys in 1307 describe an agricultural hamlet surrounded by arable fields. The 14th century Welsh Lord of Radyr, Cynwrig ap Hywel, followed by his descendants, farmed the area until it was devastated by the Black Death and by battles between the Marcher Lords in 14th and 15th centuries when the whole area was laid waste.

===Mathew family===

In 1469 Thomas Mathew (died 1469), the third or fourth son of Sir David Mathew (died 1484) of Llandaf, inherited the land by marriage to Catherine, heiress of Radyr, and built Radyr Court, a manor house on the site of what is now the Radyr Court Inn in Danescourt. The house was used as a court. Although it was destroyed by a fire in the 19th century, the three large dungeons survived and can still be seen at the Inn. On Thomas&#x27; death, his lands passed to his eldest son David and then to his younger son William Mathew (died 1528), who was knighted by King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Sir William accompanied Henry VIII to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. His successor was his eldest son Sir George Mathew, who became MP for Glamorganshire and in 1545 Sheriff of Glamorgan.

Sir George created a deer park that ranged far north of Radyr. Tenant farmers there were evicted, and the loss of rental income contributed to the decline in the family&#x27;s fortunes. He had 24 children, eight of whom were illegitimate. Many were daughters, and Sir George needed large sums of money for their dowries. On his death Sir George&#x27;s lands passed to his eldest son William, who also became an MP and invested in the Pentyrch ironworks. This was an astute move as feudalism was giving way to early industrialisation. William&#x27;s descendants inherited a diminishing fortune. Captain George Mathew, the last of the family to live in Radyr, married Elizabeth Poyntz, and the couple left Radyr to live on her estates at Thurles in County Tipperary, Ireland in 1625.

===Stuart period===
Radyr&#x27;s new owner was a wealthy landowner, Sir Edward Lewis, who was knighted by James I. Sir Edward owned St Fagans Castle and its surrounding lands, scene of the Battle of St Fagans in the English Civil War. The Lewis fortune passed to Elizabeth Lewis, who married Other Windsor [&quot;sic&quot;], 3rd Earl of Plymouth, the principal landowner in Cardiff, Penarth and Barry.

A survey in 1766 shows that the Plymouth family owned the freeholds of most of Radyr. It continues to do so today. Plymouth Estates sold of residential land in Radyr in 2007.

===Development from the 18th century===
Many residents of Radyr worked in the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works, on the other side of the River Taff in Whitchurch. The works opened in 1749 and closed in 1957.

Samuel Lewis&#x27; 1849 &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Wales&quot; says of Radyr:

&quot;A parish, in the poorlaw union of Cardiff, hundred of Kibbor, county of Glamorgan, in South Wales, 3½ miles (N. W. by W.) from Cardiff; containing 279 inhabitants. This parish probably derives its name, signifying &quot;a cataract,&quot; from the rushing waters of the river Tâf, by which it is bounded on the north-east. It was formerly comprehended within the hundred of Miskin, but has been recently separated therefrom. It comprises about eleven hundred acres of arable and pasture land, inclosed and in a profitable state of cultivation: the surface is in some parts elevated, and in others flat, but nowhere subject to inundation; the soil is a strong brown earth, favourable to the production of good crops of grain of all kinds, potatoes, and hay. The substratum is partly a hard brown stone, and partly limestone of very good quality. Radyr Court, formerly the seat of the family of Matthew, ancestors of the late Lord Llandaf, has been partially taken down, and the remainder has been modernised, and converted into a farmhouse. The turnpike-road leading from Cardiff to Llantrissent passes a little to the south of the parish; and the Tâf-Vale railway runs through it, nearly parallel with the river, which is crossed by the line in this vicinity. Some of the inhabitants are employed at the iron-works in the parish of Pentyrch.

&quot;The living is a vicarage, endowed with £200 royal bounty; patron and impropriator, the representative of the late Earl of Plymouth, who is lord of the manor: the tithes have been commuted for £113. 9s. 0d, of which a sum of £38. 9s. 0d is payable to the impropriator, and a sum of £75 to the vicar. The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is a neat plain edifice, with a curious turret at the west end. There is a place of worship for Calvinistic Methodists; a Sunday school for gratuitous instruction is held in it, and another at Radyr Court. In the parish is a spring of very cold water, called Y Pistyll Goleu, &quot;the bright water-spout,&quot; issuing from the side of a hill, under a considerable depth of earth over a limestone rock: it has by some writers been termed mineral, but it is not known to possess any other properties than that of its extreme coldness, which renders it efficacious in curing sprains and weakness of the sinews.&quot;&quot; 

Until the mid 19th century Radyr was a collection of small farms, crofts and cottages, but after Radyr railway station opened in 1863, the population rose from 400 to more than 600 in 20 years. The Taff Vale Railway and its successor, the Great Western Railway, brought significant employment to Radyr. Junction Terrace (the first street in Radyr) was built to house the railway workers. It was the start of strong demand for housing in Radyr that transformed the hamlet. The Barry Railway&#x27;s Walnut Tree Viaduct, built in 1901, dominated the village for some 70 years.

===Wartime===

In the First World War the community raised funds for a &quot;Radyr bed&quot; at the nearby Welsh Metropolitan Military Hospital in Whitchurch and established a &quot;Citizen Guard&quot; made up of those too old or too young to enlist. Losses suffered by the village are recorded on the War Memorial in Heol Isaf.

In the Second World War thousands of children were evacuated from metropolitan areas such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool. One evacuee from Woolwich, Patricia Armstrong aged nine, was knocked down by a passenger train and killed on a Saturday afternoon in May 1943 while using the Gelynis foot crossing at Morganstown. She was lodged with a family in Morganstown. As air raids on Cardiff increased, even younger children from Radyr were evacuated to boarding schools at Rhoose and Bridgend.

===Post-war history===
An extensive housebuilding programme started in the 1960s, and Radyr&#x27;s population grew rapidly — particularly children. In 1964 Radyr Comprehensive School had 135 pupils on its roll. This number more than trebled in the next decade. A new development, the Danescourt estate, was built on land surrounding Radyr Court and St John the Baptist parish church, and the land was officially incorporated as a suburb of Cardiff in 1974. Danybryn Woods, near the development, was retained as the entire forest is protected by a tree preservation order and is home to many species of plants and wildlife. Radyr railway station was renovated in 1998 and the tracks through the station were renewed, reducing journey times to Cardiff city centre.

In 2017 construction started on the first phase of a new Cardiff suburb of 7,000 houses, named Plasdwr, on countryside along the Llantrisant Road between Radyr and St Fagans.

==Governance==
===UK Parliament and Senedd===
Radyr is in the Cardiff West parliamentary constituency and the Cardiff West Senedd constituency.

===Cardiff Council===
Radyr electoral ward (often known as Radyr and Morganstown) has one seat on Cardiff Council and had an electorate of 4,368 (1 May 2008). The ward elected a Conservative, Roderick McKerlich, in the election of May 2008 and he was re-elected in 2012 and 2017. Cllr McKerlich is a member of the Council&#x27;s Environmental Scrutiny Committee.

===Community Council===
Radyr and Morganstown Community Council is funded by an addition to the Council Tax bill paid by local residents. The Community Council is run by 11 elected councillors from three wards in the parish – Radyr North (4 seats), Radyr South (3 seats) and Morganstown (4 seats) - subsequently increased to 12 councillors (4:4:4).

==Geography==
===Geological structure===
The surrounding soils are mostly a strong, brown, dry earth, well adapted for arable farming and the growing of grains of all kinds that contributed to the area being a mostly farming community until the modern era. Soils were further enriched over the millennia by alluvial deposits from the River Taff. The bedrock under the whole area is predominantly sandstone, dating from both the Devonian period (Old Red Sandstone) and the Triassic (New Red Sandstone) laid down in arid conditions. These may subsequently have been ground down by the Taff valley glacier during the last ice age around 18,000 years ago. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway.

===Radyr Weir===

The River Taff at this point runs roughly south through Taff&#x27;s Well, past Radyr and through Llandaff.

Radyr Weir was built in 1774 to divert water into a leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third obstacle to migratory salmon and sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.

From 1749, iron from Pentyrch was initially transported to the works using pack-horses, then tub boats were used on the Taff passing onto the feeder via a lock at Radyr Weir. Parts of this lock can still be seen beside the feeder sluice. In 1815 the tub boats were discontinued and a tramway built along the Taff. There is a public picnic site by the Radyr weir.
A hydro-electric scheme was built in 2016 on Radyr Weir to generate renewable energy. The Radyr Weir scheme channels more than 500 million cubic metres of water per year through two screw turbines and is expected to generate 400 kW — enough energy to power three of the city’s leisure centres — which will save 700 tonnes of CO2 annually.

The River Taff through Radyr is flanked on both sides by an undeveloped greenway that passes uninterrupted through northern Cardiff all the way to Cardiff Castle in the centre of the city, before the river enters Cardiff Bay.

===Radyr Woods Nature Area===

Radyr Woods is a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC), under the name Radyr Community Woodlands, covering , and the adjoining Hermit Woods is the smallest Local Nature Reserve (LNR) in Wales, at ). The Community Woodlands have a network of footpaths and boardwalks and includes evidence of Iron Age settlements and remains of an early cooking hearth. Originally part of the Tudor deer park owned by the Mathew family and later Radyr Quarry, the area is owned by Cardiff Council and Plymouth Estates, and managed by the Radyr community council with the support of Cardiff Council&#x27;s Parks Service.

Radyr Woods provides habitats for a wide range of species. It also has a number of natural springs that feed a duck pond and a kingfisher pond. Recent housing developments between the reserve and the railway line have added complementary public open space with picnic areas and a children&#x27;s play area. Since 1986 all maintenance and development of the reserve has been carried out by a volunteer group known as The Friends of Radyr Woods.

===Radyr hawkweed===
Radyr hawkweed is the common name of &quot;Hieracium radyrense&quot;, a very rare endemic member of the aster, daisy, or sunflower family. It is a microspecies, so far only identified at Radyr. It was first identified in 1907 at the quarry, was described as a variety in 1948 and then as a separate species in 1955. It has rarely been seen and regular surveys between 1998 and 2004 indicate that today only a single population of about 25 plants survives in the wild.

In the first survey of 1998, only nine plants were identified in one single Radyr garden, where it traditionally grew on grassy banks and lawns, often in shade. It was no longer found at the original locality of Radyr Quarry where examples were last seen in 1985. At Bridgend, six possible plants of the Radyr genus were found on an old garden wall, but confirmation of identification is still awaited.

Neither the species nor the sites have any current legal protection, and it could be under significant threat of survival in the long term from inappropriate gardening or care. Seed samples of the Radyr hawkweed have been provided to the Millennium Seed Bank, the international conservation project coordinated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and plants are being carefully cultivated. The plant normally flowers between May and early July and Radyr residents are urged by botanists to be on the look out for further examples of the endangered species while walking in the area.

==Landmark buildings and local attractions==
Danybryn Cheshire Home was once a private house owned by Sir Lewis Lougher MP. It later had two wings added to accommodate the residents, who are physically disabled young people. The Thatch, the only thatched cottage in Radyr, was built for the Mathias family in 1936. St John the Baptist parish church is nearly 800 years old, but underwent a Victorian restoration in the 19th century.

The Taff Trail cycle path passes through Radyr via Radyr Weir. Other notable buildings include The Old Church Rooms and Radyr War Memorial. In nearby districts are St Fagans National History Museum (formerly the Museum of Welsh Life) and Castell Coch.

==Education==
The Church Rooms in Park Road were also a primary school until 1896 when the Board School was opened next door. Older pupils had to travel to secondary schools in Penarth by train. The part-time Radyr Library serves the area.

===Nursery and primary schools===
Bryn Deri Primary School was opened in 1976 and has included a nursery school since September 1999. Radyr has also a private pre-school, Park Road Nursery, and a Welsh-language nursery called &quot;Cylch Meithrin&quot;, both of which are based in the Old Church Rooms.

Radyr Primary School in Park Road opened in 1896, and new classrooms were added in 1968 to accommodate the rising population. The school currently has 11 classes and over 300 pupils.

===Secondary education===
Radyr Comprehensive School has more than 1,400 pupils from across west Cardiff. It also has a large Sixth Form college with about 300 students, and an active adult education centre.
In March 2021, Radyr Comprehensive School was the scene of a major incident where &quot;malicious communication&quot; was phoned through to the school. Armed police attended the scene and all pupils were successfully evacuated from the school.

==Churches==

The Church in Wales Parish of Radyr is in the Diocese of Llandaff. The parish church of St John the Baptist, beside Radyr Chain, is now surrounded by the Danescourt housing estate. It is nearly 800 years old but was altered in the 19th century. It is a Grade II listed building.

Christ Church, although a larger building than St John&#x27;s, is the daughter church in Radyr. Designed by the Llandaff diocesan surveyor George Halliday, the nave was ready for use at Easter 1904 and the chancel and tower were completed in November 1910. Also in 1910 John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast a ring of eight bells for the tower. Lieutenant Colonel Fisher paid for the bells, and each bell is inscribed with the names of members of his family.

Radyr Methodist Church in Windsor Road replaced an earlier Methodist Church in Heol Isaf. Radyr is also served by Radyr Baptist Church, which worships in the Old Church Rooms in Park Road.

==Sport and leisure==
Llandaff North RFC is the closest rugby team to Radyr. Nearby Taffs Well RFC was formed in 1887, and has provided three former Welsh Rugby captains and six Welsh International players during its history.

Radyr Golf Club was founded in 1902 after moving from its original nine-hole course at the Tŷ Mawr in Lisvane. It is a , par 70 (SSS 70) course for men and , par 73 (SSS 73) for women, and operates all year round. Laid out by the course designer Harry Colt, the Chairman of the 2010 Ryder Cup recently described Radyr&#x27;s course as &quot;One of Colt&#x27;s Little Jewels&quot;.

Radyr Lawn Tennis Club was founded in 1914 by 20 Radyr &#x27;Gentlemen&#x27;, helped by the Earl of Plymouth Estates. Its first location was near the railway station but the courts were badly laid. Again with the help of Plymouth Estates, the club lifted the turf from all three grass courts and relaid it on its current site next to Christ Church on Heol Isaf.

Radyr Cricket Club was founded in 1890 by the Earl of Plymouth, who granted a hundred-year lease for the current riverside ground to the local residents for a nominal sum. The pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1973 while the team were away on tour. Under the leadership of the new Chairman Keith Terry, a huge fund-raising effort was made and a new pavilion opened on the footprint of the old one in 1975. Radyr currently plays in the first division of the South Wales Premier Cricket League.

Cardiff Corinthians Football Club (known locally as the &quot;Corries&quot;) has played its home games at the Riverside Football Ground in Radyr since 1974 and competes in the first division of the Welsh Football League.

The main shops in Radyr are in Station Road. One of the buildings on this road, Bryn Melyn, is now a dental surgery but was formerly the village post office.

==Transport==
===Rail===
At the turn of the 20th century Radyr had a busy railway from where coal trains were transferred onto either the Taff Vale Railway to Cardiff Docks, or the Penarth district line to the docks at Penarth, southwest of Cardiff city centre. Also, the Barry Railway Company freight route ran just to the north of Morganstown, over Walnut Tree Viaduct. To the south-east of Radyr was an extensive railway marshalling yard which included another railway bridge over the Taff to provide an alternative route towards . The sidings were lifted in preparation for a housing development in the 1970s.

Radyr railway station still handles significant traffic, with over 200 trains calling each weekday and more than 400,000 passenger journeys per year. Radyr is the northern terminus of the Cardiff City Line.

===Bus===
Cardiff Bus route 63 and Stagecoach South Wales route 122 operate from Morganstown and Radyr to Cardiff Central bus station via Danescourt, Llandaf and Pontcanna.

===Road===
The B4262 road (Heol Isaf) runs through the centre of Radyr and Morganstown, leading north to Taff&#x27;s Well and the A470 towards Pontypridd, and south to the A4119 (Llantrisant Road), which links Llantrisant with Danescourt, Llandaff and Cardiff city centre.

The M4 corridor around Cardiff was announced in 1971 as a replacement for a northern link road that had been planned since 1947 but never built. The northern &quot;Lisvane and Radyr route&quot; for the M4 was eventually chosen after a number of noisy public enquiries and active objections by residents from both communities. The new motorway was completed and opened on 10 July 1980, and passes east–west between Radyr and Morganstown. Later this section was widened to three lanes in each direction at a cost of over £71 million, being completed in December 2009. Radyr has no direct access to or from the motorway.

==Notable people==

Several notable people are associated with Radyr. The children&#x27;s author Roald Dahl (1916–90) lived in the 1920s at a house called Tŷ Mynydd in Radyr (which was demolished in 1967). He called it an &quot;imposing country mansion, surrounded by acres of farm and woodland&quot; in his book &quot;Boy: Tales of Childhood&quot;. Jimi Mistry (born 1973), who is an Asian-British actor and appeared in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;The Guru&quot; and &quot;East Is East&quot;, attended Radyr Comprehensive School. Actor Harry Ferrier also went to Radyr Comprehensive as he grew up in Radyr. and Tess Griffiths (Nee Davies).

Local sportsmen include Harry Corner (1874–1938), an English cricketer who played in the Great Britain team that won a gold medal at the 1900 Summer Olympics, who lived, died and was buried in Radyr. Hugh Johns (1922–2007), who was best known as a football commentator for ITV, retired and died in Radyr. Frank Meggitt (1901–45), a Welsh cricketer, a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who played for Glamorgan, also lived in the town after retiring from the sport. The athlete and runner Timothy Benjamin (born 1982) was born and raised in Radyr.

Another notable resident is Sir Martin Evans (born 1941), the Professor of mammalian genetics at Cardiff University who received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2001, was knighted in 2003 and was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize for medicine for his work on stem cells. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences.

<text>Heath () is a district, community and coterminous electoral ward in the north of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It is a predominantly affluent area with property prices being the third highest in the city. The area is known for its traditional 1930s detached and semi-detached properties with large south facing gardens. Roads are tree lined and large greeneries with the notable attraction of Heath Park and the joining of the University Hospital of Wales.

The population of the ward and community taken at the 2011 census was 12,629.

==Description==
Heath was originally called the Great Heath and named as a result of the large park and woodland that it once contained. After the initial development of traditionally middle-classed semi-detached housing (1920s-1950s) and more recently the construction of the University Hospital of Wales on the site of the former Heath Wood (1960s), much of the greenery has been eradicated. It should be distinguished from the Little Heath () which lies to the south of the Great Heath, in the vicinity of Crwys Road.

The 91 acre, (37 hectare) Heath Park forms the remainder of this area of grass and woodland. It includes attractions and facilities such as the George V Playing Fields, tennis courts, a miniature steam railway and refreshment facilities.

Birchgrove is a busy shopping area that is part of the ward of Heath. It is composed mostly of more affordably priced housing, mainly terraced, and has taken on an identity of its own.

The area around the University Hospital of Wales has been known as Saints Corner, due to the number of streets in the area named after well known saints.

==The Welsh language==
The number of Heath residents over three years old who speak Welsh increased from 1,378 in the 2001 UK Census to 1,422 in the 2011 UK Census. In percentage terms there was a slight decrease (from 12.1% to 11.7%). This was caused by a reduction in the number of speakers over the age of 65; the age groups 3–15 and 16—64 both showed increases.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===
The area is served by two railway stations. Heath Low Level is on the Coryton Line, linking Central and Coryton stations. Heath High Level is on the Rhymney Line, linking Central and Rhymney stations via Llanishen, Lisvane Thornhill and Caerphilly.

=== Bus ===
Cardiff Bus&#x27;s routes 38 and 39 terminate at the University Hospital of Wales, originating from the City Centre. The 8 now operates between the City Centre and Grangetown, while the 9/9A operates from the City Centre to IKEA and Cardiff Bay, including the Sports Village. The 86 service runs to Lisvane via Heath. The following services run through west of Heath:
*1/2 (City Circle)
*21 (Central Stn)
*23 (Whitchurch/Rhiwbina)
*24 (Whitchurch/Llandaff/Canton)
*25 (Central Stn)
*27 Capital City Green (Thornhill/Birchgrove)
*35 (Gabalfa or Cardiff Bay)

=== Walking and cycling ===
Cardiff Council have recently implemented a number of traffic calming measures on Allensbank Road / Heath Park Avenue with the aim of slowing traffic on the major thoroughfare and improving safety for pedestrians. The council also has plans for Cycleway 1 to run through the area, continuing on from Gabalfa to the neighbouring ward of Cyncoed.

==Governance==
Westminster: As part of Cardiff North, Heath has been represented at Westminster since 2017 by Anna McMorrin MP (Welsh Labour)

Senedd: As part of Cardiff North, Heath has been represented in the Senedd since 2011 by Julie Morgan, MS (Labour)

Heath is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. 

The electoral ward of Heath falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff North. It is bounded by Rhiwbina and Llanishen to the north; Cyncoed to the east; Gabalfa and Cathays to the south; Llandaff North to the southwest; and Whitchurch &amp; Tongwynlais to the west.

Cardiff Council: Since May 2017 Heath is represented on Cardiff Council by three councillors, Lyn Hudson (Conservative), Graham Hinchey (Welsh Labour) and Fenella Bowden (Heath &amp; Birchgrove Independents). Cllr Bowden had been a member of the Liberal Democrats but left, to sit as an Independent councillor, in November 2010. In the past it has been represented by a variety of political groups, moving from Labour in the 1990s, to all Liberal Democrat in May 2004 and, after the May 2008 election, a Conservative majority.

<text>VVT-i, or Variable Valve Timing with intelligence, is an automobile variable valve timing petrol engine technology manufactured by Toyota Group and used by brands Groupe PSA (Peugeot and Citroen), Toyota, Lexus, Scion, Daihatsu, Subaru, Aston Martin, Pontiac and Lotus Cars. It was introduced in 1995 with the &quot;2JZ-GE&quot; engine found in the JZS155 Toyota Crown and Crown Majesta.

The VVT-i system replaces the Toyota VVT system introduced in 1991 with the five-valve per cylinder &quot;4A-GE&quot; &quot;Silver Top&quot; engine found in the AE101 Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno. The previous VVT system was a 2-stage hydraulically controlled cam phasing system.

VVT-i varies the timing of the intake valves by adjusting the relationship between the camshaft drive (belt or chain) and intake camshaft. Engine oil pressure is applied to an actuator to adjust the camshaft position. Adjustments in the overlap time between the exhaust valve closing and intake valve opening result in improved engine efficiency.

Variants of the system, including VVTL-i, Dual VVT-i, VVT-iE, VVT-iW and Valvematic have followed. Direct injection systems such as the D-4 (VVT-i D-4) and D-4S are also used in conjunction with VVT-i.

== VVTL-i ==

VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift intelligent system) (also sometimes denoted as VVT-iL or Variable Valve Timing and Intelligence with Lift) is an enhanced version of VVT-i that can alter valve &quot;lift&quot; (and &quot;duration&quot;) as well as valve timing. It was introduced with the 16-valve &quot;2ZZ-GE&quot; engine found in the 1999 Toyota Celica. The engine head resembles a typical DOHC design, featuring separate cams for intake and exhaust with two intake and two exhaust valves (four total) per cylinder, but unlike a conventional design, each camshaft has two lobes per cylinder, one optimized for lower rpm operation and one optimized for high rpm operation, with higher lift and longer duration. Each valve pair is controlled by one rocker arm, which is operated by the camshaft. Each rocker arm has a slipper follower mounted to the rocker arm with a spring, allowing the slipper-follower to freely move up and down with the high lobe without affecting the rocker arm. When the engine is operating below 6,000–7,000 rpm (dependent on year, car, and ECU installed), the lower lobe is operating the rocker arm and thus the valves, and the slipper-follower is freewheeling next to the rocker arm. When the engine is operating above the lift engagement point, the ECU activates an oil pressure switch which pushes a sliding pin under the slipper-follower on each rocker arm. The rocker arm is now locked into the slipper-follower&#x27;s movements and thus follows the movement of the high rpm cam lobe and will operate with the high rpm cam profile until the pin is disengaged by the ECU. The lift system is similar in principle to Honda&#x27;s VTEC operation. Toyota has since ceased production of its VVTL-i engines in most markets because it does not meet Euro IV specifications for emissions regulations. This includes the Corolla T-Sport (Europe), Corolla Sportivo (Australia), Celica, Corolla XRS, Matrix XRS, and the Pontiac Vibe GT, all of which had the &quot;2ZZ-GE&quot; engine fitted. On the other hand, the Lotus Elise and Exige continued to offer the &quot;2ZZ-GE&quot; engine until 2011, with the Exige also offering the engine with a supercharger.

== Dual VVT-i ==

The Dual VVT-i system adjusts timing on both the intake and exhaust camshafts. It was introduced with the Altezza RS200&#x27;s &quot;3S-GE&quot; engine in 1998. Dual VVT-i was later used in Toyota&#x27;s 3.5-litre &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 engine, first appearing on the 2005 Avalon. This engine can be found on numerous Toyota and Lexus models. By adjusting the valve timing, engine start and stop occurs almost unnoticeably at minimum compression. Fast heating of the catalytic converter to its light-off temperature is possible, thereby reducing hydrocarbon emissions considerably. Most Toyota engines including the 1LR-GUE (V10, used in the Lexus LFA), UR engines (V8), GR engines (V6), AR engines (large I4), ZR engines (medium I4), and NR engines (small I4) use this technology.

== VVT-iE ==
VVT-iE (Variable Valve Timing - intelligent by Electric motor) is a version of Dual VVT-i that uses an electrically operated actuator to adjust and maintain intake camshaft timing. The exhaust camshaft timing is still controlled using a hydraulic actuator. This form of variable valve timing technology was developed initially for Lexus vehicles. This system was introduced on the &quot;1UR-FSE&quot; engine in the 2007 Lexus LS 460. The electric motor in the actuator spins together with the intake camshaft as the engine runs. To maintain camshaft timing, the actuator motor will operate at the same speed as the camshaft. To advance the camshaft timing, the actuator motor will rotate slightly faster than the camshaft speed. To retard camshaft timing, the actuator motor will rotate slightly slower than camshaft speed. The speed difference between the actuator motor and camshaft timing is used to operate a mechanism that varies the camshaft timing. The benefit of the electric actuation is enhanced response and accuracy at low engine speeds and at lower temperatures as well as a greater total range of adjustment. The combination of these factors allows more precise control, resulting in an improvement of both fuel economy, engine output and emissions performance.

== VVT-iW ==
VVT-iW (Variable Valve Timing - intelligent Wide) was introduced with the 2.0L turbocharged direct-injected &quot;8AR-FTS&quot; fitted to the Lexus NX 200t. VVT-iW uses VVT-iW on the intake valves and VVT-i on the exhaust valves. The intake cam has mid-position cam lock mechanism that retards the continuously variable timing. It offers expanded valve opening angles (Wide) which enables the engine to operate in a modified-Atkinson cycle at low rpm for improved economy and lower emissions and in the Otto cycle at high rpm for better performance, while also delivering high torque throughout the entire rpm band.

== Valvematic ==
The Valvematic system offers continuous adjustment to valve lift and timing and improves fuel efficiency by controlling the fuel/air intake using valve control rather than conventional throttle plate control. The technology made its first appearance in 2007 with the &quot;3ZR-FAE&quot; engine in the Noah and later in early-2009 in the Avensis. This system is simpler in design compared to Valvetronic and VVEL, allowing the cylinder head to remain at the same height.

== Direct injection systems ==

VVT-i has also been used in conjunction with Toyota&#x27;s gasoline direct injection (GDI) systems, which includes the D-4 and D-4S.

=== D-4 ===
D-4 (Direct Four Line) is a direct injection system used in a number of Toyota engines, sometimes referred to as VVT-i D-4. It appeared on the &quot;1JZ-FSE&quot; and &quot;2JZ-FSE&quot; engines found in some models of the Toyota Crown and Toyota Crown Majesta. It can also be found in several engines in the Toyota Avensis and Toyota RAV4. The D-4 system aims to reduce fuel consumption and emissions without compromising performance.

=== D-4S ===
D-4S (Direct Four Stroke Line) is a twin injection fuel system combining both indirect and direct injection, using a traditional manifold fuel injector on one end for low pressure and a direct injector on the other for high pressure. It works in conjunction with VVT-i. This system debuted in the &quot;2GR-FSE&quot; engine used in the Toyota Crown Athlete and the Lexus IS 350, which was also the first engine overall to combine both traditional fuel injection with direct injection. This system was also used in the &quot;4U-GSE&quot; (&quot;FA20&quot;) engine found in the 2012–2021 Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ as well as the &quot;FA24D&quot; engine used in the 2022–present Toyota GR86 and Subaru BRZ, both working in conjunction with Subaru&#x27;s AVCS system. The D-4S system helps with providing more peak power at high rpms while also reducing emissions at the same time.

It is important to note that the &quot;S&quot; in the D-4S name does not signify a supercharged engine, as engines using the D-4S system such as the 4U-GSE and the 2GR-FSE do not have superchargers. Traditionally, supercharged engines are denoted as &quot;Z&quot; under Toyota&#x27;s engine naming scheme (e.g. &quot;4A-GZE&quot;, &quot;1G-GZE&quot; and &quot;2TZ-FZE&quot;).

== VVT-i oil supply hose issues ==
In 2010, Toyota USA announced a &quot;Limited Service Campaign (LSC 90K)&quot; to replace the rubber portion of the oil supply hose for the VVT-i actuator on the &quot;2GR-FE&quot; (V6) engine, which were found to be defective. In all, approximately 1.6 million vehicles manufactured prior to 2008 were affected. The defective oil supply hoses were prone to degradation and eventual rupture, causing oil to rapidly leak and resulting in permanent engine damage. In 2014, the LSC 90K Campaign was extended to 31 December 2021 on 117,500 Toyota brand vehicles that were &quot;missed&quot; during the initial campaign.

<doc id="847271" wikidata="Q2297093" url="?curid=847271" title="VANOS">
<text>VANOS is a variable valve timing system used by BMW on various automotive petrol engines since 1992. The name is an abbreviation of the German words for &quot;variable camshaft timing&quot; ().

The initial version (retrospectively renamed &quot;single VANOS&quot;) was solely used on the intake camshaft, while the later &quot;double VANOS&quot; systems are used on intake and exhaust camshafts. Since 2001, VANOS is often used in conjunction with the Valvetronic variable valve lift system.

==Operation==
VANOS is a variator system that varies the timing of the valves by moving the position and the camshafts in relation to the drive gear. The relative timing between inlet and exhaust valves is changed.

At lower engine speeds, the position of the camshaft is moved so the valves are opened later, as this improves idling quality and smooth power development.
As the engine speed increases, the valves are opened earlier: this enhances torque, reduces fuel consumption and lowers emissions.
At high engine speeds, the valves are opened later again, because this allows full power delivery.

==Single VANOS==
The first-generation &quot;single VANOS&quot; system adjusts the timing of the intake camshaft to one of two positions — e.g. the camshaft is advanced at certain engine speeds.
VANOS was first introduced in 1992 on the BMW M50 engine used in 3 and 5 Series. In 1998 single infinitely variable VANOS was introduced on the BMW M62 V8 engine.

==Double VANOS==
The second-generation &quot;double VANOS&quot; system adjusts the timing of the intake and exhaust camshafts with continuously variable adjustment, based on engine speed and throttle opening. The first double VANOS system appeared on the S50B32 engine in 1996.

<doc id="847272" wikidata="Q4007085" url="?curid=847272" title="Nissan VVL engine">
<text>Nissan Ecology Oriented Variable Valve Lift and Timing (commonly known as VVL &amp; VVT) is an automobile variable valve timing technology developed by Nissan. VVL varies the duration, and lift of valves by using hydraulic pressure switch between two different sets of camshaft lobes. VVT varies the valve timing throughout the RPM range. Together they function similarly to Honda&#x27;s VTEC system.

The SR20VE is the most common engine with NEO VVL. There have been two main versions of this engine. The first version made and torque. This engine was used by Nissan from 1997 to 2001. It is found in the Nissan Primera, Nissan Bluebird, and the Nissan Wingroad.

The second variant of the SR20VE is found only in the 2001 and later P12 Nissan Primera. This version of the SR20VE makes , and torque. This engine is commonly known as the SR20VE &#x27;20V&#x27;. Although, in automotive terms, &#x27;20V&#x27; would normally be interpreted as having twenty valves, this is incorrect. The name &#x27;20V&#x27; is the name of the trim level of the Nissan Primera that it is found in. It is also a shortened version of the name SR20VE. This engine has 16 valves like the rest of the SR20 engines. This newer &#x27;20V&#x27; engine, along with the SR20VET, were the only SR20 engines to get restyled valve covers. It also came with an upgraded intake manifold, which has longer runners and a larger throttle body (earlier SR20VE has 60 mm).

Another version of the VVL SR engines, is the 1.6 L SR16VE. The engine block for the SR16VE is the same as the SR20VE; it also has the same cylinder bore. The crankshaft has a shorter stroke, which lowers the displacement, but allows the engine to safely rev to higher RPM. Although this engine has 1.6 L of displacement, it has more aggressive camshaft specifications. It manages to make . The camshafts from this engine are considered to be an upgrade for SR20VE owners.

From 1997 to 1998, Nissan produced 500 limited-edition SR16VE N1 engines. These engines made . They had further upgraded camshafts, upgraded intake manifold using eight injectors and a larger throttle body. These engines were found in the limited-edition Nissan Pulsar VZ-R N1. They were only sold in Japan.

The most powerful VVL engine so far is the SR20VET. The SR20VET is a turbocharged &#x27;20V&#x27; SR20VE. It uses a Garrett GT2560LS, and makes . Nissan&#x27;s technical information about this engine states that it is 9:1 compression ratio, but it really adds up to 8.8:1. Compared to the SR20DET (used in the Nissan Silvia, and Bluebird), the SR20VET (aside from having VVL technology) has improved airflow in the cylinder head, higher compression, and also improved coolant passages.

In 1998 Nissan&#x27;s RB engine was also improved using the NEO Head Technology (but no VVL), which provided the motor better fuel economy and lower exhaust emissions to keep up with emission standards.

One difference from Honda&#x27;s VTEC system is that NEO VVL engages the change of intake and exhaust cams independently for a flatter, more consistent power band. On the SR20VE, the intake camshaft is switched at 5000 rpm, and the exhaust at 6500 rpm. However this trait was not included on the newer &#x27;20V&#x27; version, as both camshafts engage at the same RPM.

<doc id="847276" wikidata="Q1173051" url="?curid=847276" title="VarioCam">
<text>VarioCam is an automobile variable valve timing technology developed by Porsche. VarioCam varies the timing of the intake valves by adjusting the tension on the timing chain connecting the intake and exhaust camshafts. VarioCam was first used on the 1992 3.0 L engine in the Porsche 968.

Porsche&#x27;s more recent VarioCam Plus combines variable valve timing with two-stage lift on the intake side. The two-stage valve-lift function is performed by electro-hydraulically operated switchable tappets. Each of these 12 tappets consists of concentric lifters which can be locked together by means of a pin. The inner lifter is actuated by a small cam lobe, while the outer ring element is moved by a pair of larger-profile lobes. The timing of each valve is seamlessly adjusted by means of an electro-hydraulically operated rotary vane adjuster at the head of each intake camshaft.

Valve timing and the valve profile are continuously altered according to conditions and engine load. For improved responsiveness on cold starts, VarioCam Plus raises the amount of lift and retards valve timing. At medium revs with minimal loads, the valve lift is lowered and timing advanced to help minimize fuel consumption and emissions. For maximum power and torque, the lift is raised and the timing is advanced. This system debuted on the 1999 Porsche 996 Turbo.

A system similar to the VarioCam Plus system was developed by Subaru for the redesigned EZ30R H6 engine, which debuted in 2003 in the Legacy and Outback.

<doc id="847277" wikidata="Q221883" url="?curid=847277" title="Kish Island">
<text>Kish ( ), is a resort island in Bandar Lengeh County, Hormozgan Province, off the southern coast of Iran in the Persian Gulf. The island constitutes the city of Kish. Owing to its free trade zone status, the island is marketed as a consumer&#x27;s paradise, offering shopping centers, tourist attractions, and resort hotels. It has an estimated population of around 40,000 residents and about 12 million visitors annually.

== History ==
Kish Island has been mentioned in history variously as Kamtina, Arakia (), Arakata, and Ghiss.

In 325 BC, Alexander the Great commissioned Nearchus to set off on an expeditionary voyage to the Sea of Oman and the Persian Gulf. Nearchus&#x27;s writings on Arakata contain the first known mention of Kish Island in antiquity. When Marco Polo visited the Imperial court in China, he commented on the Emperor&#x27;s wife&#x27;s pearls; he was told that they were from Kish.

== Geography ==

Kish is located in the Persian Gulf, from mainland Iran, and has an area of approximately with an outer boundary of and a nearly elliptical shape.

===Climate, nature, and geobotany===
Kish is located on a narrow strip of tropical vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere, with the Persian plateau to the north and the Arabian Peninsula to the south.
===Weather===
Kish has a very dry semi-equatorial climate. Over an 8-year span, the median annual rainfall in Kish was (54% in winter, 28% in autumn, and 14% in summer) and the median annual temperature was . The relative atmospheric humidity in Kish makes it like a sea island except in cold seasons. The humidity is approximately 60% for most of the year. In the months from October to April, Kish&#x27;s weather is mild, ranging from to . The statistical data in the Kish free zone&#x27;s archives shows that the island&#x27;s temperature varies from very hot to moderately hot, accompanied by relatively high humidity, often interspersed by heavy rains of short durations in certain seasons. With the exception of some southeastern coastal areas and a few other islands in the Persian Gulf, Kish Island has the most sunny hours in the region, roughly 3,100 hours per year. Based on climatological classification and general weather conditions, Kish&#x27;s proximity to the Tropic of Cancer and its exposure to high tropical pressure systems, as well as its position amidst hot and shallow waters, means the island tends to be hot and humid most of the year.

===Tourist attractions===


The Greek Ship is the wreck of a 1943 cargo steamship, the &quot;Koula F&quot;, on a beach on Kish&#x27;s southwest coast. She was originally a British ship, &quot;Empire Trumpet&quot;, and was built in Scotland. In 1966, she ran aground and all attempts to salvage her failed.

== Economy ==
Since the mid-1990s, the Iranian government has embarked on an aggressive campaign to position Kish as a rival to Dubai and to Doha. The campaign has included massive construction projects and programs designed to attract foreign investment and trade. Within the area of the &quot;Kish Free Zone&quot;, as it is known, the standard laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran are far more relaxed than on the mainland. This has resulted in more domestic tourism and international trade on the island. Kish&#x27;s population includes both Muslims and Christians. In 2009, the total foreign trade of the Kish Free Zone was approximately $9.2 billion per annum. Fifteen percent of all imports to Iran are through Kish.

Investment incentives in the Kish free trade zone include:
* 15 years tax-exemption;
* no entry visa requirement;
* 100% foreign ownership possible;
* flexible monetary &amp; banking services;
* extended legal guarantees &amp; protection.

Besides the existing Iranian Oil Bourse, a new exchange, the Kish Stock Exchange was inaugurated in 2010 to facilitate foreign investment and monetary activities.

<doc id="847278" wikidata="Q7099032" url="?curid=847278" title="Options for Change">
<text>Options for Change was a restructuring of the British Armed Forces in summer 1990 after the end of the Cold War.

Until this point, UK military strategy had been almost entirely focused on defending Western Europe against the Soviet Armed Forces, with the Royal Marines in Scandinavia, the Royal Air Force (RAF) in West Germany and over the North Sea, the Royal Navy in the Norwegian Sea and North Atlantic, and the British Army in Germany.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact occurring between 1989 and 1991, the threat of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe fell away. While the restructuring was criticised by several British politicians, it was an exercise mirrored by governments in almost every major Western military power, reflecting the so-called peace dividend.

Total manpower was cut by approximately 18 per cent to around 255,000 (120,000 army; 60,000 navy; 75,000 air force).

Other casualties of the restructuring were the UK&#x27;s nuclear civil defence organisations – the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and its field force, the Royal Observer Corps (a part-time volunteer branch of the RAF), both disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995.

* Cutting the number of frigates and destroyers from around 50 to 40. This was largely achieved through the decommissioning and disposal of aging types such as the remaining Leander-class frigates, as well as the sale of the remaining Type 21 frigates to Pakistan and the early Type 22 frigates to Brazil.

==On television==
A dramatisation of the effects that Options for Change had on the ordinary men and women serving in the armed forces came in the ITV series &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot;. The fictional infantry regiment portrayed in the series, the King&#x27;s Fusiliers, was one of those selected for amalgamation. It showed the whole process of negotiation over traditions, embellishments, etc. between the two regiments involved, and the uncertainty that many of those serving felt for their jobs in the light of two separate battalions merging into one, with the resulting loss of manpower.

<text>Jeremiah Terminator LeRoy, or simply JT LeRoy, is a literary persona created in the 1990s by American writer Laura Albert. LeRoy was presented as the author of three books of fiction, which were purportedly semi-autobiographical accounts by a teenage boy of his experiences of poverty, drug use, and emotional and sexual abuse in his childhood and adolescence from rural West Virginia to California. Albert wrote these works, and communicated with people in the persona of LeRoy via phone and e-mail. Following the release of the first novel &quot;Sarah&quot;, Albert&#x27;s sibling-in-law Savannah Knoop began to make public appearances as the supposed writer. The works attracted considerable literary and celebrity attention, and the authenticity of LeRoy has been a subject of debate, even as details of the creation came to light in the 2000s.

==Published works==
Albert originally published as Terminator and later JT LeRoy.

*&quot;Sarah&quot; (2000)
:By turns magical and realistic, the novel &quot;Sarah&quot; is narrated by a nameless boy whose mother Sarah is a lot lizard: a prostitute who works the truck stops in West Virginia. She can be abusive and abandoning, yet he longs for her love and tries to follow in her world, working for a pimp who specializes in &quot;boy-girls&quot;.
* &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot; (2001)
:Ten short stories that form a novel about the childhood of LeRoy, torn from his foster parents at age four when his emotionally disturbed mother reclaims him and then runs away with him. She alternately clings to LeRoy and abandons him, subjecting him to patterns of abuse and exploitation she has suffered throughout her life.
*&quot;Harold&#x27;s End&quot; (2005)
:The novella follows a young heroin addict who is befriended by Larry, an older man, from whom he receives an unusual pet. Illustrations are by Australian artist Cherry Hood. Published by Last Gasp.

===Contributions to other written works===

Work credited to LeRoy was published in literary journals such as Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot;, &quot;Memorious&quot;, and &quot;Oxford American&quot; magazine&#x27;s Seventh Annual Music Issue. LeRoy was listed as a contributing editor to &quot;BlackBook&quot; magazine, &quot;i-D&quot; and &quot;7x7&quot; magazines, and is credited with writing reviews, articles, and interviews for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; of London, &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Film Comment&quot;, &quot;Filmmaker&quot;, &quot;Flaunt&quot;, &quot;Shout NY&quot;, &quot;Index Magazine&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, and &quot;Vogue&quot;, among others.

LeRoy&#x27;s work has also appeared in such anthologies as &quot;The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003&quot;, MTV&#x27;s &quot;Lit Riffs&quot;, &quot;XXX: 30 Porn-Star Portraits&quot;, Nadav Kander&#x27;s &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Nothing&quot;, and &quot;The Fourth Sex: Adolescent Extremes&quot;. LeRoy is also listed as guest editor for &quot;Da Capo&#x27;s Best Music Writing 2005&quot;.

Additionally, LeRoy was credited with liner notes and biographies for musicians Billy Corgan, Liz Phair, Conor Oberst, Ash, Bryan Adams, Marilyn Manson, Nancy Sinatra and Courtney Love and profiled award-winner Juergen Teller.

==Circumstances of LeRoy&#x27;s creation==
Calling a suicide hotline in the 1990s, Albert reached Dr. Terrence Owens, a psychologist with the McAuley Adolescent Psychiatric Program at St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center in San Francisco. Owens did not know her as Laura Albert at the time, but as &quot;Jeremiah&quot; or &quot;Terminator&quot;. Owens is credited with encouraging &quot;Jeremiah&quot; or &quot;Terminator&quot; to write during their phone therapy sessions. Albert also recorded conversations without Owens&#x27; consent, and these illegally recorded phone calls made their way into the 2016 documentary &quot;&quot;.

Albert explained the circumstances of LeRoy&#x27;s existence in a 2006 interview in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; with Nathaniel Rich; she described her troubled history and her alleged personal experiences with abuse, abandonment, sex work, gender identity, and her need, since childhood, to create alternate personae (chiefly over the telephone) as a psychological survival mechanism, through which she could articulate her own ideas and feelings.

At her 2007 fraud trial, Albert described LeRoy as her &quot;veil&quot;.

== Exposure==
Throughout the 1990s, virtually no one had ever glimpsed the reclusive author. Then, in 2001, a person wearing a wig and sunglasses began appearing in public, claiming to be LeRoy.

In August 2005, journalist John Nova Lomax published the article &quot;Coal Miner Mother of a Mess&quot; in the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, casting doubt on the particulars of LeRoy&#x27;s story. Lomax recounted his frustrated attempts to contact LeRoy by e-mail, pointed out several obvious discrepancies of fact, and cast doubt on LeRoy&#x27;s existence. A few months later, Stephen Beachy, in an October 2005 article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, revealed that LeRoy was indeed a fictional creation, invented by writer Laura Albert, and that LeRoy&#x27;s purported public appearances in wig and sunglasses were made by an actor. Beachy asserted that Albert had been posing as LeRoy&#x27;s caretaker and spokesperson, calling herself &quot;Speedie&quot;, under the false premise that LeRoy lived with Albert and her husband Geoffrey Knoop, who used the pseudonym &quot;Astor&quot;. 

In January 2006, journalist Warren St. John revealed his finding in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the person posing as LeRoy in a wig and sunglasses for six years was 25-year-old Savannah Knoop, Geoffrey Knoop&#x27;s sibling. In a subsequent article, St. John published details of an interview with Geoffrey Knoop, in which Knoop confirmed that LeRoy did not exist, and that his sibling was LeRoy&#x27;s public face. Knoop also admitted to St. John that Laura Albert had written the works published as LeRoy&#x27;s.

In 2008, Savannah Knoop published a memoir, &quot;Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT LeRoy&quot;, about their six-year career as an impersonator.

== Film option and lawsuit==
Antidote International Films, Inc., and its president Jeffrey Levy-Hinte announced plans for a film adaptation of &quot;Sarah&quot; to be directed by Steven Shainberg. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, when Shainberg &quot;learned who had truly written &quot;Sarah&quot; an inspiration came to him to make a &#x27;meta-film&#x27;, a triple-layered movie that would blend the novel with the lives of its real and purported authors in a project he took to calling &quot;Sarah Plus&quot;.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; also reported that this new project &quot;required the rights to Laura Albert&#x27;s story, rights that she in no uncertain terms refused to grant&quot;.

In June 2007 Antidote sued Laura Albert for fraud, claiming that a contract signed by Albert in LeRoy&#x27;s name to make a feature film of &quot;Sarah&quot; was null and void. A jury found against Albert in the sum of $116,500, holding that the use of the pseudonym to sign the film rights contract was fraudulent.

== In art and popular culture ==

Armistead Maupin&#x27;s 2000 novel &quot;The Night Listener&quot; features the case of Anthony Godby Johnson, which is similar to that of LeRoy.

In 2013 filmmaker Michael Arias claimed LeRoy for his inspiration in translating Taiyo Matsumoto&#x27;s manga &quot;Sunny&quot;. 

At a 2013 symposium with filmmaker J. J. Abrams and Doug Dorst in New York, actress and writer Lena Dunham said that LeRoy &quot;co-opted my imagination for a full year of my life. [...] It was pretty remarkable. And then you also go, &#x27;This person isn&#x27;t who they claim to be, but they still wrote this book that captured all of our imaginations, so then why does the identity of the author even matter when you&#x27;re reading fiction and engaging with it in a really personal way?&#x27;&quot; That same year, Laura Albert told &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;You know, JT LeRoy does not exist. But he lives. That&#x27;s what a famous film historian once said about Bugs Bunny.&quot; 

In 2014 interviewer Dylan Samson on the LastLook App blog stated that &quot;Albert had ingeniously hacked the literary establishment&quot;.

In March 2014 the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that the Academy of Friends Oscar Party in San Francisco invited JT LeRoy – played by gender fluid fashion model Rain Dove Dubilewski – to walk the runway as part of its HIV/AIDS fundraiser. 

As part of the artist and filmmaker Lynn Hershman Leeson’s 2014 exhibition &quot;How To Disappear,&quot; she premiered her video &quot;The Ballad of JT LeRoy&quot;, examining Laura Albert&#x27;s use of the literary persona JT LeRoy. Reflecting on the parallels between JT LeRoy and her own alter ego Roberta Breitmore, Hershman Leeson has commented:

The concept of an alter ego is not new at all. Writers have been protecting themselves in that way for centuries. Mary Shelley did it. Of course Laura took this practice further and I think that was very smart and I do not think she deserves the kind of condemnation that she got. If I had done the Roberta thing ten years later, I would have faced the same problems.

The story of JT LeRoy was the subject of a 2018 feature film based on Savannah Knoop&#x27;s memoir. Directed by Justin Kelly, the film starred Laura Dern as Laura Albert and Kristen Stewart as Knoop.

Documentaries about LeRoy include &quot;&quot; (2016) directed by Jeff Feuerzeig, and &quot;The Cult of JT LeRoy&quot; (2015) directed by Marjorie Sturm.

<text>Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish (also spelled with various transliterations as Mashipinashiwish, Me-chee-pee-nai-she-insh, Mash-i-pi-wish, Mitch-e-pe-nain-she-wish, or Mat-che-pee-na-che-wish) was a hereditary chief of a Potawatomi Indian group in what is now Michigan. The Potawatomi are one of the peoples of the Council of Three Fires; the others are the Odawa and the Ojibwe, all Algonquian-language speakers.

==Life==

==Post-American Revolution activities==

Listed by the United States by English name of Bad Bird and as an Ojibwe, the chief made his sign on the Treaty of Greenville, in 1795, which ended the Northwest Indian War after the defeat of the Western Confederacy. (The Ojibwe were closely allied with the Potawatomi and Ottawa in the Council of Three Fires). This treaty was signed by chiefs of those three tribes and others that had been part of the Western Confederacy. The bands ceded considerable territory in present-day Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, allowing settlement by European Americans in what the U.S. called the Northwest Territory, an area north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi.

The 1821 Treaty of Chicago, which Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish signed on August 29, 1821, there listed as an Ottawa, reserved a three mile-square tract for an Indian village at the head of the Kalamazoo River (spelled then as &quot;Kekalamazoo&quot;). The present-day city of Kalamazoo developed at this site.

Bad Bird was identified as signing the US Treaty with the Potawatomi, of September 19, 1827, by which he ceded the Kalamazoo tract reserved for the Indian village to the U.S. He did not sign the 1828 Treaty with the Potawatomi, which ceded additional land in southwest Michigan to the U.S. He did sign the 1832 U.S. Treaty with the Potawatomi, which also ceded additional land in the area.

The &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&quot; estimates that Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish (Bad Bird) was born about 1735 and died about 1805. It does not attest to his signing the treaties from 1821 to 1832 with the United States. The dates suggest that perhaps a younger man of the same name signed these treaties.

The federally recognized tribe in the United States known as the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi (formerly known as the Gun Lake Band) is based in Dorr, Michigan in Allegan County. They renamed their tribe after this chief, as its members trace their descent from him and his wife.

<text>William John Sherring (September 18, 1877 – September 5, 1964) was a Canadian athlete of English and Irish descent, winner of the marathon race at the 1906 Olympic Games (later called &quot;Intercalated Games&quot;).


During the decade of the early 1900s, Sherring, from Hamilton, Ontario was acknowledged to be a world class marathoner. He had won a second place behind a fellow countryman Jack Caffery at the Boston Marathon in 1900. He also had won the Hamilton Around the Bay Road Race on two occasions.

In 1906, Sherring – an athlete of St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic Club – was chosen to represent Canada in the Athens Olympic Games. However, it was left up to him, a working man with meager resources (he was a brakeman at the Grand Trunk Railway), to finance his journey to Athens. Sherring managed to collect an amount claimed to be between $45 and $90 (a clearly insufficient amount to travel to Athens), which he then bet on a horse named &quot;Cicely&quot; which won with good odds. He arrived in Athens seven weeks before the Olympic Games and started to work as a porter at the Athens railway station.

At the marathon race, the Sherring proceeded at a steady pace, at one point a half-mile behind the leaders, before taking the lead at about the fifteen mile mark and finishing seven minutes before the next runner. Prince George of Greece ran the last 50 metres of the marathon alongside Sherring. Sherring received a live lamb and a statue of Athena as a reward. When he returned to Canada, Hamilton City Council awarded him $5000 and the City of Toronto awarded him a further $400. Baron Pierre de Coubertin wrote a letter to the Governor General of Canada, Albert Grey, protesting the gifts as inconsistent with the Olympic ideal of &quot;sport for sport&#x27;s sake.&quot; So far as is known, Sherring got to keep his money. The province of Ontario named two new townships in New Ontario (now part of Cochrane District) in honour of Sherring, Sherring twp and Marathon twp (not to be confused with Marathon, Ontario).

Upon his triumphant return from the marathon, Sherring quit athletics and worked as a customs officer in Hamilton until his retirement in 1942.

Sherring was inducted into the Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1955.

After his death, the Around the Bay Road Race was renamed the Billy Sherring Memorial Road Race, and Hamilton has since built a Billy Sherring Park to commemorate their most famous athlete.

Sherring is thought to have inspired the founders of Panathinaikos to adopt the shamrock as the Greek multi-sport club&#x27;s official emblem in 1918.

<text>The Rhino Times is a conservative news and opinion website covering Guilford County, North Carolina.

== History ==
John Hammer founded the website. In the mid-80s, Hammer worked the door of a bar in Greensboro called The Rhinoceros Club. One day the owner asked him to create a newsletter. One side would advertise bands coming to the bar, while Hammer could put whatever he wanted on the other side. Hammer produced the newsletter until 1986.

Hammer founded the print newspaper The Rhinoceros Times in 1991. Another print edition was founded in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2002 and discontinued in 2008.

The primary newspaper went into hundreds of thousands dollars of debt and ceased publication in 2013, but it was bought by local real estate developer Roy Carroll and reopened later that year. It ceased print publication again in 2018 and became an online-only newspaper. In June 2024, Hammer retired and Carroll sold the website to longtime editor/writer Scott Yost.

==Features==
The newspaper features editorial columns by Greensboro-based science fiction and fantasy author Orson Scott Card and local investigative reporting by &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling author Jerry Bledsoe.

The back page of the paper features a regular commentary article by editor John Hammer, &quot;Under the Hammer&quot;. In the feature, Hammer is highly critical of President Barack Obama, referring almost exclusively to him as either &quot;Barack Hussein Obama&quot; or by his last name. Hammer also promotes conspiratorial and fringe theories that Obama is a &quot;secret Muslim&quot; and was not born in the United States.

==Controversies==

===Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoon===

The newspaper published two of the controversial Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons in February, 2006.

===Ku Klux Klan===

In July 2009, the paper won a $25,000 judgment for punitive damages against an Arkansas-based Ku Klux Klan group and its leader Thomas Robb. The case was filed in 2006 when the paper alleged the Klan inserted its fliers into &quot;Times&quot; newspapers, which then went to customers. The Klan counter-sued for defamation, but lost. In addition to punitive damages, the paper reportedly received the nation&#x27;s first permanent injunction against the KKK, barring them from using the paper to distribute their literature in the future.

===Prisoner cartoon===

In June 2011, a controversy was created when the &quot;Rhino Times&quot; published a cartoon by Geof Brooks that featured two African American men in orange prison jumpsuits in the front yards of what appears to be two suburban homes. The first character states, &quot;Geez! Dey builds a brand new jail wit&#x27; three squares [square meals] an&#x27; cable...&quot;, and the second character concludes, &quot;And dey puts us on house arrest so&#x27;s dey can pays for it!&quot;

Editor John Hammer apologized in the next edition of the paper, claiming that the cartoonist had intended the prisoners to be caucasian; in his apology, Hammer did not address why the cartoon had been colorized as it was, nor the failure of the editors to catch the mistake. The &quot;Greensboro News &amp; Record&quot; reported that Hammer called Guilford County Commissioners Chairman Melvin &quot;Skip&quot; Alston to apologize for the cartoon. Alston commented that he felt the cartoonist &quot;might have had some racial intent&quot;.

===Photography arrest story===

In January 2015, Editor John Hammer published a story claiming two Irish tourists were accosted, mistreated, and arrested by Greensboro police while trying to take photos in the city&#x27;s Bicentennial Garden. The story, including interviews with the couple and details of their arrest, was a fabrication. In response to controversy over the story, Hammer claimed the piece was intended as satire, though the publication did not in any way label it as such. In the next week&#x27;s issue, Hammer apologized to readers for not marking the piece as satire and &quot;to the police for maligning them.&quot;

<text>William Robert Hill (born April 3, 1978) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates.

Hill attended the University of Miami, where he played baseball, and was then drafted by the Chicago Cubs. In 2000, before playing for the Cubs organization, he played for the Newark Bears in the independent Atlantic League. He hit .326 with 13 home runs and 82 RBI. He also stole a team record 81 bases and walked a league record 101 times in 132 games.

When Hill reached the major leagues with the Cubs, he was assigned the number 17, becoming the first player to wear the number since Mark Grace, who had worn it from 1988 through 2000 with Chicago.

Hill was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates as the centerpiece of the Aramis Ramírez trade in August 2003. With Pittsburgh in 2004, he hit .266 with two home runs and 27 RBI in a part-time role. He spent much of 2005 in Triple-A and was dealt to the San Diego Padres on November 21, 2005, for a player to be named later. Hill spent the 2006 season with the Triple-A Portland Beavers. Hill signed with the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League in February 2008, eight years after he began his professional career there. He hit .238 in 100 games. Hill played 24 games for the Bears in 2009. He signed with the Chico Outlaws of the Golden Baseball League for the 2010 season.

In March 2011, Hill was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame. From 2012 to 2014, Hill was head baseball coach at Los Gatos High School in Los Gatos, California, before becoming head coach at Mission College in Santa Clara in 2015.

<doc id="847305" wikidata="Q678018" url="?curid=847305" title="Bandon, County Cork">
<text>Bandon (; ) is a town in County Cork, Ireland. It lies on the River Bandon between two hills. The name in Irish means &#x27;Bridge of the Bandon&#x27;, a reference to the origin of the town as a crossing point on the river. In 2004 Bandon celebrated its quatercentenary. The town, sometimes called the Gateway to West Cork, had a population of 8,196 at the 2022 census. Bandon is in the Cork South-West (Dáil Éireann) constituency, which has three seats.

==History==

In September 1588, at the start of the Plantation of Munster, Phane Beecher of London acquired, as Undertaker, the seignory of Castlemahon. It was in this seignory that the town of Bandon was formed in 1604 by Phane Beecher&#x27;s son and heir Henry Beecher, together with other English settlers John Shipward, William Newce and John Archdeacon. The original settlers in Beecher&#x27;s seignory came from various locations in England. Originally the town proper was inhabited solely by Protestants, as a by-law had been passed stating &quot;That no Roman Catholic be permitted to reside in the town&quot;. A protective wall extended for about a mile around the town. Written on the gates of Bandon at this time was a warning &quot;Entrance to Jew, Turk or Atheist; any man except a Papist&quot;. A response was scrawled under the sign noting: &quot;The man who wrote this wrote it well, for the same thing is writ on the gates of hell.&quot;

Buildings sprang up on both sides of the river and over time a series of bridges linked both settlements. Like other towns in Cork, it benefitted greatly from the patronage of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, although he was not, as he liked to claim, its &quot;founder&quot;. Christ Church, Kilbrogan, is the oldest church in Bandon, and also the oldest purpose-built post-Reformation Protestant church in Ireland. In 1689 it was the scene of a clash between Jacobite and Williamite forces during the War of the Two Kings. After an uprising by Protestant inhabitants who expelled the Irish Army garrison, a larger force under Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel arrived and retook the town.

Sir John Moore, who was later leader of the British Army and was killed at the Battle of Corunna in Spain in 1809, was governor of the town in 1798.

In the 19th century, the town grew as a leading industrial centre which included brewing, tanning, distilling, corn and cotton milling. The now closed Allman&#x27;s Distillery produced at one point over 600,000 gallons of whiskey annually. The Industrial Revolution in the 1800s and the advent of the railways had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural ecosystem of the area. Local weaving operations could not compete with mass-produced cheap imports. St Peter&#x27;s Church was built in 1847, and Bandon Town Hall was completed in 1862.

Major General Arthur Ernest Percival was commander of the British garrison in Bandon in 1920–21 during the Irish War of Independence. He was subsequently the commanding officer of the British troops who surrendered Singapore to the Japanese forces in 1942. In 1945 he was invited by Douglas MacArthur to witness the surrender of Japanese forces in Tokyo in 1945 which ended the Second World War. Irish army leader Michael Collins was killed in an ambush at Béal na Bláth, about outside Bandon.

Between 1911 and 1926, the non-Catholic population of Bandon dropped from 688 (22% of the population) to 375 (13% of the population), a decline of 45.5%. Peter Hart argued, in &quot;The IRA and its Enemies&quot; (1998), that during the Irish War of Independence, Bandon&#x27;s Protestant population, which was largely unionist, suffered from Irish Republican Army (IRA) reprisals. In particular, ten Protestant men were shot over 27–29 April 1922 (two months before the start of the Civil War), &quot;because they were Protestant.&quot;

Niall Meehan argued, however (2008, 2014), that Hart was mistaken. The killings were not &quot;motivated by either land agitation or by sectarian considerations.&quot; In &quot;Peter Hart, the Issue of Sources&quot;, Brian Murphy noted a British intelligence assessment, &quot;A Record of the Rebellion in Ireland in 1920–1921&quot;, that Hart cited selectively. Hart wrote, &quot;the truth was that, as British intelligence officers recognised, &quot;in the south the Protestants and those who supported the Government rarely gave much information because, except by chance, they had not got it to give&quot;.”. Murphy observed, &quot;Hart does not give the next two sentences from the official Record which read&quot;:

 an exception to this rule was in the Bandon area where there were many Protestant farmers who gave information. Although the Intelligence Officer of the area was exceptionally experienced and although the troops were most active it proved almost impossible to protect those brave men, many of whom were murdered while almost all the remainder suffered grave material loss. 

Murphy, therefore, concluded in a 1998 review of Hart&#x27;s research, &quot;the IRA killings in the Bandon area were motivated by political and not sectarian considerations&quot;. He amended this in 2005 to &quot;Possibly, military considerations, rather than political, would have been a more fitting way to describe the reason for the IRA response to those who informed.&quot; In 2013 Bandon Mayor Gillian Coughlan described a song about these historical events by Professor David Fitzpatrick of TCD as &quot;insulting to the memory of people who fought and to people who died&quot;.

Castle Bernard, the seat of Lord Bandon, was also burned in the Irish War of Independence.

==Twin city==
Bandon has a twin city agreement with Bandon, Oregon, in the United States. That city was founded in 1873 by Lord George Bennet, a native of the Irish Bandon who named the American one after it, and who is known especially for having introduced gorse into the US ecology with some disastrous results.

==Transport ==
Bandon is 27 km southwest of Cork City, on the N71 national secondary road, and served by Bus Éireann bus services from Cork City. The nearest airport is Cork Airport.

==Sport==
Sports clubs in the area include Bandon Rugby Football Club (inaugural winners of the 1886 Munster Senior Rugby Cup), Bandon Association Football Club (whose men&#x27;s senior team play in the Munster Senior League Senior Premier Division), and Bandon GAA (affiliated to the Carbery GAA division of Cork GAA).

Bandon AC is an athletics club based in the area. There are also a number of martial arts clubs in the town, including karate, taekwondo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and other clubs.

Bandon Golf Club is an 18-hole golf course on the grounds of Castle Bernard.

==Education==
There are four secondary schools in Bandon. One of these, Bandon Grammar School, is a fee-paying Church of Ireland-ethos boarding school. The other schools are Hamilton High School, St. Brogan&#x27;s College, and Coláiste na Toirbhirte (formerly known as Presentation Sisters College). Bandon Grammar School and St. Brogan&#x27;s College are both mixed schools, Hamilton High School is a boys only school, and Coláiste na Toirbhirte is a girls only school.

==Demographics==
As of the 2022 census, Bandon had a usually resident population of 8,101. Of these, 67.4% identified as White Irish, 0.4% as White Irish Travellers and 20.8% as other white ethnicities. A further 1.2% identified as Black or Black Irish, 2.2% as Asian or Asian Irish and 3.0% as other ethnicities. 5.0% of the population did not state their ethnicity.

<text>Spelt (&quot;Triticum spelta&quot;), also known as dinkel wheat is a species of wheat. It is a relict crop, eaten in Central Europe and northern Spain. It is high in protein and may be considered a health food.

Spelt was cultivated from the Neolithic period onward. It was a staple food in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to the Middle Ages. It is used in baking, and is made into bread, pasta, and beer. 

It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the closely related common wheat (&quot;T. aestivum&quot;), in which case its botanical name is considered to be &quot;Triticum aestivum&quot; subsp. &quot;spelta&quot;. It is a hexaploid, most likely a hybrid of wheat and emmer.

== Description ==

Spelt is a species of &quot;Triticum&quot;, a large stout grass similar to bread wheat. Its flowering spike is slenderer than that of bread wheat; when ripe, it bends somewhat from the vertical. The spike is roughly four-edged. The axis of the spike is brittle and divided into segments; it shatters into separate segments when fully ripe. Spelt differs from bread wheat in that each seed (a caryopsis, botanically a fruit with its wall fused to the single seed inside) stays fully encapsulated by its husk.

== Confusion with other wheats ==

Especially in the context of descriptions of ancient cultures, the English word &quot;spelt&quot; has sometimes been used for grains that were not &quot;T. spelta&quot;, but other species of hulled wheat such as &quot;T. dicoccum&quot; (emmer wheat) or &quot;T. monococcum&quot; (einkorn wheat, also known as &quot;little spelt&quot;, in French &quot;petit épeautre&quot;). This confusion may arise either from mistranslation of words found in other languages that can denote hulled wheat in general (such as Italian &quot;farro&quot;, which can denote any of emmer, spelt or einkorn; spelt is sometimes distinguished as , &#x27;large farro&#x27;, emmer as , (&#x27;medium farro&#x27;), and einkorn as , &#x27;little farro&#x27;), or changing opinions about which actual species of wheat are described in texts written in ancient languages. Thus, the meaning of the ancient Greek word ([zeiá]) or is either uncertain or vague, and has been argued to denote einkorn or emmer rather than spelt. Likewise, the ancient Roman grain denoted by the Latin word &quot;&quot;, although often translated as &#x27;spelt&#x27;, was in fact emmer. Similarly, references to the cultivation of spelt wheat in Biblical times in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia are incorrect: they result from confusion with emmer wheat.

== Evolution ==

=== Hybridisation and polyploidy ===

Like common wheat, spelt is a hexaploid wheat species, which means it has six sets of chromosomes. It is derived from a hybridisation event between a domesticated tetraploid wheat such as durum wheat and another wheat species, increasing the number of sets of chromosomes. Genetic evidence indicates an initial hybridisation of a domesticated tetraploid wheat and the diploid wild goat-grass &quot;Aegilops tauschii&quot;. It further shows that spelt could have arisen as the result of a second hybridisation, this time of bread wheat and emmer wheat, giving rise to European spelt. The spelt genome continues to influence the breeding of modern hexaploid bread wheat through recent hybridisation.

Spelt, being closely related to bread wheat, is a likely source of alleles to increase wheat&#x27;s genetic diversity, and so improve crop yields. Analysis of the Oberkulmer cultivar of spelt found 40 alleles that could contribute to increased yield. Among the differences were spelt&#x27;s larger grain size, greater fertility of tillers, and longer fruiting spikes. &quot;&quot; is an effector-triggered resistance gene for powdery mildew.

=== History of cultivation ===

Spelt has been cultivated since approximately 5000 BCE. In the fifth millennium BCE, there are archaeological remains in the north of Iraq and in Transcaucasia, north-east of the Black Sea. Much more evidence comes from Europe. Remains of spelt have been found in Denmark, Germany, and Poland from the later Neolithic (dating from 2500–1700 BCE). Evidence of spelt has been found from across central Europe from the Bronze Age. In the south of Germany and Switzerland in the Iron Age (750–15 BCE), it was a major type of wheat, while by 500 BCE, it had in addition become widespread in the south of Britain. There is evidence that spelt cultivation increased in Iron Age Britain as damp regions of the country with heavy soils tolerated by spelt were being settled.

In the Middle Ages, spelt was cultivated in parts of Switzerland, Tyrol, Germany, northern France and the southern Low Countries. Spelt became a major crop in Europe in the 9th century CE, possibly because it is more suitable for storage and being husked makes it more adaptable to cold climates.

Spelt was introduced to the United States in the 1890s. In the 20th century, spelt was replaced by bread wheat in almost all areas where it was still grown. The organic farming movement revived its popularity somewhat toward the end of the 20th century, as spelt requires less fertilizer. Since the beginning of the 21st century, spelt has become a common wheat substitute for making artisanal loaves of bread, pasta, and flakes. By 2014, the grain was popular in the UK, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. Shortages were reported although spelt was grown in those countries. In the United States, most spelt is grown in Ohio as of 2022.

== Nutrition ==

A reference serving of uncooked spelt provides of food energy and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value) of protein, dietary fiber, several B vitamins, and numerous dietary minerals (table). Highest nutrient contents include manganese (143% DV), phosphorus (57% DV), and niacin (46% DV). Spelt contains about 70% total carbohydrates, including 11% as dietary fibre, and is low in fat (table).

Spelt contains gluten, and is therefore suitable for baking, but this component makes it unsuitable for people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease.
In comparison to hard red winter wheat, spelt has a more soluble protein matrix characterized by a higher gliadin:glutenin ratio.

== Products ==

In Germany and Austria, spelt loaves and rolls (&quot;dinkelbrot&quot;) are widely available in bakeries. The unripe spelt grains are dried and eaten as &quot;grünkern&quot; (&quot;green grain&quot;). In some countries, spelt may be considered a health food; for example, in Australia it is grown organically for the health food market. Dutch &quot;jenever&quot; makers sometimes distil with spelt, while beer brewed from spelt exists in Bavaria and Belgium.

<text>Louie Broady Nunn (March 8, 1924 – January 29, 2004) was an American politician who served as the 52nd governor of Kentucky. Elected in 1967, he was the only Republican to hold the office between the end of Simeon Willis&#x27;s term in 1947 and the election of Ernie Fletcher in 2003.

After rendering non-combat service in World War II and graduating from law school, Nunn entered local politics, becoming the first Republican county judge in the history of Barren County, Kentucky. He worked on the campaigns of Republican candidates for national office, including John Sherman Cooper, Thruston Morton, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the Republican nominee for governor in 1963, but ultimately lost a close election to Democrat Ned Breathitt. An executive order signed by Governor Bert T. Combs that desegregated Kentucky&#x27;s public services became a major issue in the campaign. Nunn vowed to repeal the order if elected, while Breathitt promised to continue it.

In 1967, Nunn ran for governor again. After defeating Marlow Cook in the Republican gubernatorial primary, he eked out a victory over Democrat Henry Ward. The state offices were split between Democrats and Republicans, and Nunn was saddled with a Democratic lieutenant governor, Wendell Ford. Despite a Democratic majority in the General Assembly, Nunn was able to enact most of his priorities, including tax increases that funded improvements to the state park system and the construction of a statewide network of mental health centers. He oversaw the transition of Northern Kentucky University from a community college to a senior institution and brought the University of Louisville into the state university system. The later years of his administration were marred by race riots in Louisville and a violent protest against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky. Following his term as governor, he lost to Walter Dee Huddleston in the 1972 senatorial election and John Y. Brown Jr. in the 1979 gubernatorial election. In his later years, he sometimes supported the political ambitions of his son, Steve, and advocated for the legalization of industrial hemp in Kentucky. He died of a heart attack on January 29, 2004.

== Early life ==
Louie Broady Nunn was born in Park, Kentucky – a small community on the border of Barren and Metcalfe counties – on March 8, 1924. His first name, Louie, honored a deceased friend of his father&#x27;s; his middle name, Broady, was a surname in his mother&#x27;s family. Louie was the youngest of the four sons born to Waller Harrison and Mary (Roberts) Nunn; their youngest child, Virginia, was their only daughter. The Nunns were farmers and operated a general store, though Waller suffered from a congenital heart condition and severe arthritis and was limited to light chores. The eldest brother, Lee Roy, became an influential campaigner and fundraiser for the Republican Party.

Nunn obtained the first eight years of his education in a one-room, one-teacher schoolhouse in Park. During his teenage years, he gave himself a hernia while lifting a heavy piece of farm equipment. This, combined with his father&#x27;s health history, may have contributed to back pain issues that plagued him for most of his life. In 1938, he matriculated to Hiseville High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at Bowling Green Business University, now Western Kentucky University.

After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Nunn departed for Cincinnati, Ohio, to take flying lessons in hopes of becoming a B-17 pilot. By the time he finished his flight training, however, the Army had discontinued its air cadet program. On June 2, 1943, he enlisted in the Army and received his recruit training at Fort Wolters near Fort Worth, Texas. He was transferred numerous times. First, he was stationed at Sheppard Air Force Base near Wichita Falls, Texas. Next, he was assigned to the 97th Infantry Division, then received additional training at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Finally, he transferred to the Army Medical Corps, but his back injury flared up, and he received a medical discharge on September 13, 1945. He held the rank of corporal at the time of his discharge.

Following his military duty, Nunn pursued a pre-law degree at the University of Cincinnati. Three years later, he matriculated to the University of Louisville School of Law where he was a classmate of future congressman Marlow Cook. Nunn earned his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1950. He opened his legal practice in Glasgow, Kentucky, in September 1950.

On October 12, 1950, Nunn married Beula Cornelius Aspley, a divorcee from Bond, Kentucky. The couple had two children – Jennie Lou, born in 1951, and Steve, born in 1952. Aspley also had three children from her first marriage. Nunn left the Methodist denomination in which he had been raised after marrying Aspley, joining her as a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

== Political career ==
On June 17, 1953, Nunn declared as a Republican candidate for county judge and was ultimately the only Republican to declare. In the Democratic primary, one of the challengers charged that the incumbent had misused his office for personal gain. In the wake of the investigation, a group of disgruntled Democrats formed an organization to elect Nunn, who defeated his Democratic challenger by a vote of 5,171 to 4,378, becoming the first Republican elected county judge in the history of the heavily Democratic county.

In 1956, Nunn served as statewide campaign manager for Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s presidential bid, as well as the senatorial campaigns of John Sherman Cooper and Thruston Morton. The Kentucky Junior Chamber of Commerce named him &quot;Young Man of the Year&quot; in 1956. He was not a candidate for re-election as county judge in 1957 but was appointed as city attorney for the city of Glasgow in 1958. He considered running for governor in 1959 but became convinced it would be a bad year for Republicans and did not make the race. He managed successful re-election campaigns for Senator Cooper in 1960 and Senator Morton in 1962. He also managed the state campaign of presidential candidate Richard Nixon in 1960. Although John F. Kennedy won the election, Nixon carried Kentucky 54% to 46%.

Nunn was the Republican nominee for governor of Kentucky in 1963. During the campaign, he attacked an executive order issued by sitting Democratic governor Bert T. Combs that desegregated public accommodations in the state. Calling the order &quot;a dictatorial edict of questionable constitutionality&quot;, Nunn charged that it had been dictated by U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. In a television appearance, Nunn displayed a copy of the order and declared &quot;My first act will be to abolish this.&quot; &quot;The New Republic&quot; accused him of conducting &quot;the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky&quot;. He lost the election to Democrat Ned Breathitt by a margin of just over 13,000 votes.

=== Governor of Kentucky ===
In 1967, Nunn faced his old classmate, Jefferson County Judge Marlow Cook, in Kentucky&#x27;s first Republican gubernatorial primary in many years. Nunn attacked Cook as a &quot;liberal, former New Yorker&quot;, and some of his supporters referred to Cook&#x27;s &quot;Jewish backers&quot;. The injection of antisemitism into the campaign drew criticism from Senator John Sherman Cooper, who threw his support to Cook. Nunn also attacked Cook for his Catholic faith, a tactic that proved particularly effective with the state&#x27;s Protestant voters. In a close vote, Nunn defeated Cook to secure the nomination.

Nunn then faced Democrat Henry Ward in the general election. During the campaign, Nunn charged that Democrats wanted to raise taxes to pay for administrative inefficiencies. He also played up divisions within the Democratic party, and was endorsed by two-time former Democratic Governor A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler. Nunn allied himself closely with the national Republican campaign against Lyndon B. Johnson, bringing several prominent Republicans to the state to speak for him. He won the election by a vote of 453,323 (51%) to 425,674 (48%), even though half of the other state offices went to Democrats, including the lieutenant governorship, won by Wendell Ford.

The General Assembly was controlled by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda. Despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes when the outgoing Breathitt administration projected a shortfall of $24 million in the state budget, Nunn convinced the General Assembly to pass an increase in the motor vehicle license fee from $5.00 to $12.50 and raise the state sales tax from three percent to five percent. Nunn&#x27;s budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn&#x27;s proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income tax for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.

Nunn oversaw the entry of the University of Louisville into the state&#x27;s public university system. Fulfilling a campaign promise, he helped transform Northern Kentucky Community College into Northern Kentucky State College (which later became Northern Kentucky University), a four-year institution and member of the state university system. Historian Lowell H. Harrison argued that these actions diluted state support to existing higher education institutions. Nunn also supported the newly created Kentucky Educational Television.

Nunn doubled the accommodations in the state park system. Barren River Lake State Resort Park was completed during his tenure, and three other parks were planned and funded during his administration. He also greatly improved the state mental health system. Under his leadership, a statewide network of 22 mental health centers was completed, and all four state psychiatric hospitals were accredited for the first time. Nunn called the revamping of the state mental health system his proudest accomplishment as governor. There was not total agreement between Nunn and the legislature, however. The governor vetoed one-quarter of the bills passed in the 1968 legislative session and 14 percent of those passed in the 1970 session. An open housing bill became law without Nunn&#x27;s signature, and he also refused to sign the 1970 state budget as a form of protest. (Unsigned bills become law after ten days under the Kentucky Constitution, in contrast to the pocket veto provision in the federal constitution.)

A supporter of President Nixon&#x27;s law-and-order philosophies, Nunn called out the National Guard to break up violent protests in the state. In May 1968, he sent the Guard to Louisville to break up race-related protests that followed peaceful civil rights marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that interfered with final examinations. The latter protest culminated in the burning of one of the university&#x27;s ROTC buildings.

From 1968 to 1969, Nunn served on the Executive Committee of the National Governors&#x27; Conference and, in 1971, chaired the Republican Governors Association. &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; said of Nunn&#x27;s administration &quot;On the whole, his management of the state&#x27;s finances has been sound. ... [H]e took a general fund facing a deficit, restored it to solvency, and kept it healthy. No scandals have marred the Nunn record. He chose able men to direct his revenue and finance departments, and their efficiency saved the state millions of dollars.&quot; Historian Thomas D. Clark called Nunn the strongest of Kentucky&#x27;s eight Republican governors. At the time, Kentucky governors could not serve consecutive terms; in the 1971 race, Nunn backed Tom Emberton, who lost to Ford.

== Later career ==
Following his term as governor, Nunn opened a law practice in Lexington. He campaigned for the retiring Cooper&#x27;s seat in 1972, losing to Democrat Walter Dee Huddleston, a state senator who had managed Ford&#x27;s campaign. His loss came despite a landslide victory for Richard Nixon in the state and was generally blamed on his advocacy of raising the sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent in 1968. He continued working on behalf of Republican candidates and backed Ronald Reagan&#x27;s primary challenge to incumbent Gerald Ford in 1975. His last run for office came in 1979 when he was again the Republican nominee for governor against Democrat John Y. Brown Jr. He decried the excessive spending, expanding government, and increased state employment that had occurred under Democratic administrations. He also attacked Brown for his playboy image (he was married to former Miss America Phyllis George) and his refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his inexperience in government. Despite these attacks, Nunn lost by a vote of 558,008 to 381,278 and returned to his legal practice.

In the 1980s, Nunn served on the boards of regents of Morehead State University and Kentucky State University. He served as a lecturer at Western Kentucky University, and received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Louisville in 1999. During the late 1980s, he criticized Senator Mitch McConnell, one of the emerging leaders of the state&#x27;s Republican party, for not doing more to support other Republicans in their bids for office; McConnell maintained that he had to focus on his own reelection campaign in 1990. In 1988, Nunn unsuccessfully challenged Congressman Jim Bunning in his bid to retain his position as Kentucky&#x27;s Republican national committeeman.

In 1994, Nunn&#x27;s wife Beula filed for divorce from a hospital bed where she lay dying of cancer. She claimed she was trying to preserve some of her estate for her children. A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside. Some property issues were still pending at the time of Beula&#x27;s death in 1995. During the divorce proceedings, Nunn&#x27;s son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between him and his father. A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family. The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fiancée, Amanda Ross. The letter also quoted Louie Nunn of saying &quot;you have no family&quot; to Steve, indicating that their relationship had deteriorated long before Louie&#x27;s death, allegedly because of the younger Nunn&#x27;s abusiveness.

In 1999, Nunn again considered a bid for governor, precluding a potential bid by his son, Steve, a state representative from Glasgow. He cited personal and health issues for not making the race. In 2000, he backed the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. Nunn reconciled with his son, and when Steve ran for governor in 2003, Louie supported him. After Steve Nunn ran third in a four-way primary, the elder Nunn supported the Republican nominee, Ernie Fletcher, hosting a fundraiser for him.

Nunn also became an advocate of legalizing industrial hemp in Kentucky, writing, &quot;Frankly, I was opposed to the legalization of hemp for years because I had been of the opinion hemp was marijuana. I was short-sighted in my thinking, and I was wrong.&quot; In 2000, Nunn secured an acquittal for the actor Woody Harrelson, who came to Lee County, Kentucky, and planted hemp seeds in open defiance of Kentucky&#x27;s law forbidding the cultivation of hemp. Later, he traveled to South Dakota where, at the base of Mount Rushmore, he publicly presented an Oglala Lakota leader with bales of hemp after the tribe&#x27;s crop was confiscated by officers from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.

Louie B. Nunn died of a heart attack at his home just outside Versailles, Kentucky, on January 29, 2004, hours after hosting a luncheon with labor leaders seeking help in dealing with the newly elected Fletcher administration. He was buried at the Cosby Methodist Church cemetery in Hart County, Kentucky. The Cumberland Parkway was renamed the Louie B. Nunn Cumberland Parkway in 2000, and the main lodge at the Barren River Lake State Resort Park is also named in Nunn&#x27;s honor.

<text>Pyttipanna (Swedish), pyttipanne (Norwegian), pyttipannu (Finnish) or biksemad (Danish), is a culinary dish consisting of chopped meat, potatoes and onions fried in a pan, similar to a hash, and popular in Scandinavia. The term is Swedish for &quot;small pieces in a pan&quot;.

Traditionally consisting of potatoes, onions, and any kind of chopped or minced meat such as sausage, ham, or meatballs, diced and then pan fried, it is often served with a fried egg, pickled beetroot slices, sour pickled gherkin slices, capers and sometimes ketchup or brown sauce. An alternative version of the dish stirs in cream after frying, much like a gravy, turning it into &quot;cream stewed pyttipanna&quot; ().

The dish was originally made from leftovers of past meals but now it is also common to prepare pytt i panna from prime ingredients. Frozen pyttipanna of many varieties can be bought in almost every Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and Finnish supermarket. Many variants of the dish exist, including vegetarian and vegan dishes.

Pytt i panna is often abbreviated to &quot;pytt&quot;, especially when referring to variants such as &quot;oxpytt&quot; (pytt i panna made with beef) or &quot;krögarpytt&quot; (&quot;inn master&#x27;s pytt&quot;, made with more finely diced potatoes and beef).

<text>Mabini, officially the Municipality of Mabini (), is a municipality in the province of Batangas, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 50,858 people.

Mabini is known for its diving and snorkeling sites. It is named after Apolinario Mabini, a Filipino revolutionary hero.

==History==

=== Legendary origins ===
According to legend, the first Malay settlers to inhabit the vast fertile land bordering the two bodies of water now known as Batangas Bay and Balayan Bay first found anchor along the shores of the land protruding down southwestward, known as the Calumpan Peninsula.

The Malay settlers found the land fertile and agriculturally appropriate and the sea rich in marine resources, and they established their settlement in this once vast unknown land.

As more Malay settlers arrived from distant lands, more settlements were founded until even the upland regions of the peninsula were settled. The inhabitants had their own form of village government. They were ruled by a headman, a &quot;datu&quot;, or a sultan, in case of big settlements. Malay civilization began to take roots.

Rapid increase of population meant that it did not take long before several nearby regions were inhabited to comprise the whole province of Kumintang, better known later as Batangas.

=== Recorded History ===
During the Spanish colonial rule, the Calumpan Peninsula was made a part of the &quot;pueblo&quot; of Bauan, in the province of Kumintang. The same peninsula territory of Bauan was subdivided into barrios: Mainaga, Pulong-Niogan, Pulong-Balibaguhan, Anilao, Solo, Pulong-Anahao, Bagalangit, Nag-Iba, Malimatoc, Saguing and Talaga. For more than three hundred years, while the archipelago was under Spanish control, the peninsula remained a part of the “pueblo” of Bauan until the early part of the American occupation. The people of this peninsula, like other people of other regions, suffered untold hardships under the Spanish rule.

The Philippine Revolution of 1896 ended Spanish rule in the country, and in the Calumpan Peninsula the revolutionaries were led by Don Francisco Castillo, known as Apian Kiko.

&quot;Mabini&quot;, derived from the Philippine hero Apolinario Mabini, was founded when inhabitants of the region wanted a new municipality independent of the town of Bauan.

Eleven barrios of the Calumpan Peninsula and the whole of the Maricaban Island was declared this new, independent municipality.

The new municipality of Mabini was inaugurated on January 1, 1918, with Captain Francisco Castillo, known as the founder of the town, as the first appointed Municipal President.

==Geography==
According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the municipality has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batangas.

Mabini is from Batangas City and from Manila.

Barangay San Juan was formerly the sitios of Nag-ilong and Lugay in the barrio of Mainaga, constituted into a separate and independent barangay through &quot;Republic Act No. 212&quot;, approved June 1, 1948.

<text>Carroll Overton Alley, Jr. (June 13, 1927 – February 24, 2016) was an American physicist. He served as the Principal Investigator on the Apollo Program&#x27;s Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, which significantly restricted the possible range of spatial variation of the strength of the gravitational interaction. Alley was a PhD student of Robert Henry Dicke.

Alley’s goal was to understand quantum mechanics, gravitation, and relativity. His lifelong research interests included experimental and theoretical questions about the foundations of gravitational and quantum physics.

Alley developed some of the earliest important laboratory tests of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theories of relativity. In recent years he became known for alternative theories of gravitation. He was a Physics professor at University of Maryland, College Park, emeritus since 2008, until his death on 24 February 2016.

==Career details==

Professor C. O. Alley served as the first chairman of the Lunar Ranging Experiment team. He was the Principal Investigator (PI) for the Apollo 11 laser ranging retro-reflector (LR3) experiment, deployed on the moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969. In addition to the gravitational interaction results mentioned above, the experiment measured the orbit of the moon to centimeter accuracy—and still produces data to this day. For this work he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Award in 1973; was designated by the Maryland Academy of Sciences, for their 1976 Bicentennial Exhibit, as one of two outstanding 20th Century Scientists; and received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Richmond in 1978.

Some additional accomplishments of Professor Alley, his graduate students, the Quantum Electronics Research and Lunar Ranging Experiment Teams, support staff, and numerous collaborators include:
* Surveyor 7 laser beam pointing tests in preparation for the Apollo 11 experiment and visual detection of laser beams from Earth, as well as subsequent lunar laser ranging on later Apollo missions 
* Role in the commissioning of the Global Positioning System by contributing to the calculations that correct for time dilation in gravitational fields 
* Conducting relativistic proper time experiments by flying caesium and rubidium atomic clocks in a Navy P3C aircraft over the Chesapeake Bay, to measure the effects of gravitational potential difference on their recorded proper times and comparing those times to ground clocks using short laser pulses
* Experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics with light quanta, including the first delayed-choice experiment in quantum mechanics
* First use of spontaneous parametric down conversion in quantum optics to exhibit entangled polarization quantum states of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm type (thesis of Alley’s PhD student Yan Hua Shih)
* Direct measurements of possible difference in the one-way speed of light between the east-west and west-east directions on the rotating Earth, by flying atomic clocks between Christchurch, New Zealand, and Thule, Greenland
In later years Alley collaborated in the study, development, and application of a new formulation of gravity as curved spacetime found by Professor Huseyin Yilmaz. They postulated that the correct understanding of the lunar laser ranging measurements, the behavior of clocks in a global positioning system, and many strong gravity field astrophysical phenomena—such as gravitational radiation—require the interactive N-body solutions of the Yilmaz Theory (or &quot;New Theory&quot;), which are not present in Einstein’s General Relativity field equations. Alley maintained the and remained active in the study of gravitation until his death.

==Biography==

Carroll O. Alley, Jr. was born in Richmond, VA to Carroll Overton Alley, Sr. and Mittie Points Alley on June 13, 1927. Alley attended John Marshall High School, where he was a swimmer, choir member, and Cadet Corps First Captain and Regimental Commander of A Company. He earned a B.S. in mathematics and physics from the University of Richmond in 1948, and returned there in 1951-’52 as a physics instructor.

Alley attended Princeton University, earning a master&#x27;s degree (1952) and PhD (1962) in Physics. From 1954 to 1960, he was an instructor and lecturer in both Electrical Engineering and Physics at Princeton, where he met and married his late wife, Elizabeth (Slack) Delany Alley. His daughter Frances Alley Kruger was born in Princeton in 1955.

At Princeton, Alley studied electrical engineering as well as theoretical and experimental physics. He was greatly influenced by the work of Eugene Wigner and John Archibald Wheeler. His PhD dissertation developed new methods of detecting the ground state hyperfine transition in optically-pumped rubidium vapor for the type of atomic clock invented by Princeton professors Robert Henry Dicke—Alley’s thesis advisor—and Thomas R. Carver. This type of atomic clock was later used in the U.S. Global Positioning System and the European Union’s Galileo Global Positioning System.

Alley initiated laser physics research at the Institute of Optics and the Physics Department of the University of Rochester, where he was an assistant professor of physics and optics from 1960 to 1963. His daughter Margaret Alley Seymour was born in Rochester in 1961. In 1963 Alley was recruited to the University of Maryland, College Park Campus, by John S. Toll, then-chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

For most of his career—more than 40 years—Alley served as professor of Physics and director of the Quantum Electronics Research Group at the University of Maryland. He taught and conducted research at Maryland from 1963 to 2008, at which time he was granted Professor Emeritus status—a post he held until his death on February 24, 2016.

<doc id="847328" wikidata="Q4858063" url="?curid=847328" title="Baraat">
<text>Baraat (, ) () or Varayatra () is a groom&#x27;s wedding procession in the Indian subcontinent. In North India, it is customary for the bridegroom to travel to the wedding venue (often the bride&#x27;s house) on a mare (or vintage car nowadays and chariots or elephants in the past), accompanied by his family members.

The &quot;baraat&quot; can become a large procession, with booking its own band, dancers, and budget. The groom and his horse are covered in finery and do not usually take part in the dancing and singing; that is left to the &quot;baraatis&quot; or people accompanying the procession. The groom usually carries a sword. The term &quot;baraati&quot; is also more generically used to describe any invitee from the groom&#x27;s side. Traditionally, &quot;baraatis&quot; are attended to as guests of the bride&#x27;s family.

The &quot;baraat&quot;, headed by a display of fireworks and accompanied by the rhythm of the dhol, reaches the meeting point, where the elders of both the families meet. In Indian Hindu weddings, the groom is greeted with garlands, tilak and aarti. In traditional Indian weddings, &quot;baraats&quot; are welcomed at the wedding venue with the sound of &quot;shehnais or nadaswaram&quot;, which are considered auspicious at weddings by Hindus.
== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Baraat&quot; is derived from Sanskrit word &quot;Varayātrā&quot; (वरयात्रा) literally meaning groom&#x27;s procession. In Bengali, the baraat is usually referred to as &quot;Borjatri&quot; (বরযাত্রী) when the groom along with his family members, friends and closest relatives leave for the bride&#x27;s home which is the venue of the marriage. 

==Dogra Baraat==

In Dogra tradition, baraat is organized with great pomp and show. It is also known as &quot;Janjh&quot; in Dogri. When the groom gets ready, he is adorned with Sehra by his maternal uncle. This is known as &quot;Sehrabandhi&quot;. After this, &quot;Ghodi-chadha&quot; takes place where groom rides the horse with sword in his hand. The horse is offered fodder and chana daal. The sisters of groom adorn groom with necklaces of gold or silver or even currency notes. Dogri folk songs called &quot;ghodia&quot; are sung. And sisters in law apply kajal on groom&#x27;s eyes. Dhol and musical instruments are played and the family members and friends of groom dance in joy. The baraat halts temporarily at local Mandir for &quot;darshan&quot;. This ceremony is called &quot;Dev Karaj&quot;. In older times, when baraat used to travel long distances, then women of household used to stay at home. They would celebrate the marriage by performing &quot;Jagarna&quot; dance. When the baraat reaches wedding venue, fireworks are displayed. The groom is welcomed by his mother in law by applying tilak &amp; aarti and offering him sweets and Dogra dish &quot;Suchi&quot;. After this, the ceremony of &quot;Milini&quot; takes place. Relatives of both the groom and bride meet and exchange gifts. Ladies from the bride&#x27;s side may then sing a special song called &quot;sidnya&quot; (humorous song). After the completion of wedding rituals, the groom typically will bring the bride to his home.

==Kauravi Baraat==

In Odia language, Baraat is also called &quot;Barjaatri&quot; or &quot;Varanugaman&quot; where &quot;Bar&quot; &quot;(Var)&quot; means groom, &quot;jaatra&quot; &quot;(yaatra)&quot; means procession/journey and &quot;anugaman&quot; means arrival. In this ceremonial procession the groom and his family members and friends arrive at the wedding &quot;mandap&quot; amid great pomp and magnificence. Aarti and Tilak of groom is performed and he is also offered curd mixed with honey or jaggery.

== Bengali Boraat or Borjatri ==
In Bengali tradition, &quot;Bor Jatri&quot; is basically the &quot;baraat&quot;, where the groom, his family and friends dress up for the wedding and start their journey to the bride’s house or the wedding venue.

==Punjabi Baraat==
Both men and women participate in the procession of a Punjabi &quot;baraat&quot; (also known as &quot;jaññ&quot;). Close male relatives of both the bride and groom always wear turbans, which indicates honor. When the &quot;baraat&quot; arrives at the wedding venue, a ceremony known as the (literally, &quot;meeting&quot; or &quot;merger&quot;) is carried out, in which equivalent relatives from the groom and bride&#x27;s sides greet each other.

== Rajput Baraat ==
The bridegroom is usually dressed in a gold achkan, with an orange turban and a churidar or jodhpurs with juttis. The baraat members also must wear achkans or sherwanis with jodhpurs and safas (colorful turbans). The procession to the bride&#x27;s house looks rather regal as there is absolutely no dancing on the streets by the baraatis. In fact, all members, including the groom who rides an elephant or a female horse, carry swords. The horse is important for Rajputs.

== Gujarati Baraat or Varghodo==
In a Gujarati wedding, the groom arrives at the bride&#x27;s house on a horse and is followed by a dancing procession led by his family members and friends is called &quot;Varghodo&quot; or &quot;Jaan&quot;. They are also accompanied by a group of band members playing instrumental music. The groom, in reverence, touches feet of mother-in-law.

== Rajasthani Baraat ==
Baarat on camels is a traditional feature of wedding processions in Rajasthan, India. Camels have been an integral part of Rajasthani culture for centuries, serving as a primary mode of transportation and a symbol of wealth and status. In a typical Rajasthani wedding, the groom arrives at the bride’s home or the wedding venue on camel itself or a cart pulled by a camel decorated with fabrics and embroidery. The groom, dressed in traditional attire, often wears a turban and carries a ceremonial sword.

The baarat is accompanied by a lively procession of family members, friends, and musicians. Traditional Rajasthani folk music and dance, including the Ghoomar dance, are performed to celebrate the joyous event.

<text>Renegade is a freeware bulletin board system (BBS) written for IBM PC-compatible computers running MS-DOS that gained popularity among hobbyist BBSes in the early to mid 1990s. It was originally written by Cott Lang in Turbo Pascal, optimized with assembly language, based on the source code of Telegard, which was in turn based on the earlier WWIV.

==Transfer of control==
On April 23, 1997, after the decline of BBS popularity, Lang ceased development work on Renegade and passed it on to two Renegade BBS utility authors: Miri Spence and Gary Hall. Spence and Hall maintained Renegade for three years, releasing three updates with their new, ordinal date version scheme.

Jeff Herrings, another former third-party software developer, was handed the source by Spence in January 2000 after offering help when he found there was no Y2K-compliant version of the software. Herrings released a public alpha version of Renegade in March 2000 addressing Y2K-compliance problems. He stepped down as active programmer in October 2001 citing lack of time and desire.

Spence eventually handed the program over to Corey Snow in 2002, who intended to release an open-source, Java-based clone of the software which never saw the light of day.

T.J. McMillen received the source code in October 2003 from Miri Spence in a plea to have some much needed features added to Renegade. McMillen then added the help of Chris Hoppman, one of the few remaining Renegade BBS operators around. Together they released a few updates which addressed bugs and debuted some new features before Hoppman lost interest. Hoppman stepped down from the project in 2004 and is no longer involved. This left McMillen, once again, alone to carry on the Renegade code.

Herrings released his Y2K-compliant source code to the public via the Dreamland BBS in September 2005 citing he believed it was right to share a software he deemed mostly abandoned in hopes that it would see further and more active development. He claimed that due to a perceived immoral injustice by Miri Spence, he was no longer under any moral obligation to a previous agreement not to release the source code.

With little free time, Renegade idled for more than a year until April 2006 when McMillen (also known as Exodus) added the talent of Lee Palmer to the Renegade team to replace Hoppman. Palmer (also known as Nuclear) is a former third-party software developer for the T.A.G. Bulletin Board System. Palmer disappeared sometime around 2012 and has not been heard from. McMillen was once again the lone code holder.

In 2013, McMillen released the v1.19 for DOS Source code on GitHub in hopes someone would add to it. No one stepped up in 7+ years, so McMillen once again resurfaced in 2020 to release version 1.22/DOS. With some time on his hands due to the pandemic, McMillen was able to hash out v1.25 for DOS on May 16, 2021.

Lee Woodridge was added to the RG Development Team in September 2021. Woodridge worked on his own fork of the v1.19a/DOS code and added quite a few fixes and updates. Woodridge was asked to join and to merge his code base with the v1.25/DOS code. This was done, and versions 1.30/DOS and v1.33/DOS were released.

Work has continued on Renegade rather slowly, but the team would like to release something new every year.

A full install and an upgrade package of v1.35/DOS (Sept. 01, 2024) can be downloaded from the Official Renegade BBS website listed below.

==Current information==

The current work is now being coded under &#x27;The Renegade Development Team&#x27; name.

Version 1.35 for DOS Full Install and Upgrade versions were released on September 1, 2024.

<text>The Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, also known as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge or the Wilson Bridge, is a bascule bridge that spans the Potomac River between Alexandria, Virginia and Oxon Hill, Maryland in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. The original bridge was one of only a handful of drawbridges in the Interstate Highway System. It contained the only portion of the Interstate System owned and operated by the federal government until construction was completed and it was turned over to the Virginia and Maryland departments of transportation.

The Wilson Bridge carries Interstate 95 (I-95) and I-495 Capital Beltway. The drawbridge on the original span opened about 260 times a year, frequently disrupting traffic on a bridge that carried about 250,000 cars each day. The new, higher span requires fewer openings.

The bridge&#x27;s west abutment is in Virginia, a small portion is in Washington, D.C., and the remaining majority of it is within Maryland (because that section of the Potomac River is within Maryland&#x27;s borders). About of the western midspan portion of the bridge crosses the tip of the southernmost corner of the District of Columbia. It is the only bridge in the US that crosses the borders of three state-level jurisdictions (DC, Maryland, and Virginia). The section in Washington DC is also the shortest segment of Interstate Highway between state lines.

The bridge is named for the 28th president of the U.S., Woodrow Wilson (1856–1924), a native of Staunton, Virginia. While he was president, Wilson reportedly spent an average of two hours a day riding in his automobile to relax or to &quot;loosen his mind from the problems before him&quot;. President Wilson was an advocate of automobile and highway improvements in the U.S. In 1916, he said, &quot;My interest in good roads is [...] to bind communities together and open their intercourse, so that it will flow with absolute freedom and facility&quot;.

== Original bridge ==

A bridge at Jones Point was first proposed by the District Highway Department in August 1952 as part of a study of Potomac River bridge crossing needs. The bridge linked to US Route 1 and the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway in Virginia. In Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, the bridge would connect with Overlook Avenue and Chesapeake Street. It was also intended to link with the proposed extension of the George Washington Memorial Parkway/Anacostia–Kenilworth Parkway (later built as the southern leg of the Anacostia Freeway) in Prince George&#x27;s County (authorized by Congress in 1930 but never built) and the Inter-County Metropolitan Freeway (proposed in 1944 and later planned and constructed as the Capital Beltway). The Regional Planning Council approved construction of the bridge just four months later. The bridge won the backing of Representative Joel Broyhill of Virginia, who championed legislation funding its construction in Congress. By November 1953, the US Department of the Interior had also recommended its construction. Congress authorized construction of the bridge on August 17, 1954, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the measure into law later that month.
The bridge received its name through the efforts of Representative Burr Harrison, a Virginian who sought to honor the 100th anniversary of the birth of Woodrow Wilson. Eisenhower signed this legislation into law on May 22, 1956, as part of a bill authorizing initial funding for the bridge. Construction of the bridge began in September 1958, and it opened to traffic on December 28, 1961. Edith Wilson, Wilson&#x27;s widow, died that very morning; she was supposed to have been the guest of honor at the bridge&#x27;s dedication ceremony. The 5,900-foot (1,798 m) bridge included a bascule bridge to allow large, ocean-going vessels access to the port facilities of Washington DC. It had six traffic lanes and was designed to handle 75,000 vehicles a day.

By 1999, the old Wilson Bridge was handling 200,000 vehicles a day, more than 2.6 times the original design capacity. The bridge had serious maintenance problems and underwent continuous patchwork maintenance beginning in the 1970s. It was completely redecked in 1982 and 1983.
One of the reasons for the inadequate design was that it was not originally planned to be part of the major north–south I-95, but rather, as part of the circumferential Capital Beltway. I-95 was planned to bisect the Capital Beltway with a shorter through-route, extending north from Springfield, Virginia, across the Potomac River, through downtown Washington DC, and the northeastern section of DC, and into Maryland to reconnect with the beltway near College Park, Maryland. While the portions in Virginia and in DC south of New York Avenue were built, the remaining segment—designated the Northeast Freeway—was opposed by residents, and construction was canceled in the late 1970s. The portion north of Springfield was designated as a spur, I-395 (Shirley Highway). The eastern half of the Capital Beltway was additionally signed as I‑95.

Traffic was also boosted by growth in the Washington metropolitan area and increases in suburb-to-suburb commuting. Because housing costs in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, are much lower than in Northern Virginia—which saw enormous job growth in recent decades—tens of thousands of workers commute daily over the bridge, a situation not anticipated when it was constructed. After the highway on both sides of the bridge was widened to eight lanes, the six-lane bridge became a daily bottleneck as heavy traffic slowed in order to funnel into fewer lanes. Two incidents demonstrated this. On November 11, 1987, a snowstorm snarled traffic; many commuters ran out of gas and spent the night in their vehicles on the bridge. In November 1998, the bridge was closed for several hours during the afternoon rush hour when Ivin L. Pointer engaged police in a seven-hour standoff, creating traffic backups. (Pointer jumped off the bridge, but survived the fall.)

== Replacement bridge ==

===Construction===

Maryland, Virginia, and federal highway officials had been confronting the problems and exploring alternatives for many years. After considerable study and public debate, officials chose a plan that would double the capacity and increase the height of the drawbridge to reduce the frequency of openings. The new bridge would include two side-by-side drawbridges with a total of 12 lanes and of vertical navigational clearance at the draw span. The project also included an extensive redesign and reconstruction of the Capital Beltway as it approached the new bridge from the Maryland and Virginia sides.

Construction began on the replacement facilities and approaches in 1999. Bridge construction began in October 2000 with the commencement of a dredging contract. On May 17, 2001, the Maryland State Highway Administration (MSHA) issued notice to proceed for the foundations contract. The preconstruction conference for the bridge superstructure contract was held on September 11, 2001. The events of the day, including the crash of American Airlines Flight 77 into the nearby Pentagon, caused the evacuation of the bridge foundation construction crews and disrupted the preconstruction meeting. On December 16, 2001, MSHA received only one bid (which was more than 70 percent above the engineer&#x27;s estimate), and the bid was ultimately rejected. In total, the work was executed by 26 prime contractors and 260 subcontractors.
The majority of the highway project was completed by 2009, and the upgraded Telegraph Road interchange was completed in early 2013. The Wilson Bridge project received numerous awards, including four American Road and Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA) national awards for environmental excellence, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Outstanding Projects and Leaders (OPAL) award, the Gustav Lindenthal Award, the Marvin M. Black Excellence in Partnering award, and the ACEC Grand Award. Starting in 2001 with a Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)-approved financial plan budget of $2.44 billion (equivalent to $ in ), the project completed its financial close in early 2015 at $2.36 billion (equivalent to $ in )—$86 million (equivalent to $ in ) below its original budget after more than 10 years of construction.

The first new, six-lane Potomac River bridge opened for northbound Outer Loop traffic on June 10, 2006, with only minor delays (the lane striping of the bridge and approach did not initially match up). The first car to cross was a Toyota Corolla. On July 16, 2006, at midnight, traffic from the Inner Loop of the beltway was rerouted to the future Outer Loop express lanes for two years. The original 1961 bridge was demolished at 12:35 am, on August 29, 2006, to make room for completion of the six-lane Inner Loop bridge, located between the original bridge and the new Outer Loop span. Local commuter Daniel Ruefly was given the honor of initiating the detonation after he won a contest where he was judged the driver to have suffered the most over the years from the bridge&#x27;s congestion, with an estimated combined total of two and a half years spent in traffic caused by the bottleneck at the bridge. The airspace above the bridge, and the beltway in both directions, were closed for the detonation, which happened 36 minutes behind schedule. The second bridge span was dedicated on May 15, 2008, and on May 30, 2008, Inner Loop traffic was shifted onto it.

After the completion of the Wilson Bridge project, the state of Maryland and the commonwealth of Virginia became the joint owners of the completed bridge, and both states exercise joint responsibility and oversight of bridge activities, maintenance, and operations. The District of Columbia, a jurisdiction that once had ownership rights to the 1961 Wilson Bridge span, relinquished future ownership rights and responsibility for the new bridge. Additionally, DC granted a permanent easement to Maryland and Virginia for the portion of the bridge located within its boundaries.

===Use and features===
Of the 12 lanes, six are used for local traffic. Four lanes, isolated from the local lanes, are used for through traffic. The bridge design allows for the remaining two lanes to be used by Washington Metro or other mass transit, though there are no current plans to do so. The consultant team for the main bridge over the Potomac River included engineers of record Parsons Transportation Group; bridge architect Miguel Rosales of Rosales + Partners; Consulting engineers were A. Morton Thomas &amp; Associates, Inc.; Mueser Rutledge Consulting Engineers provided Geotechnical engineering; Subconsultants Finley McNary Engineers (piers); and Hardesty &amp; Hanover, LLP (bascule span). Project management was provided by WSP USA, Rummel, Klepper &amp; Kahl LLP, and URS Corporation.
The northern span of the bridge also includes pedestrian and bike passage, separated from traffic by safety barriers. The path, which opened on June 6, 2009, is about wide and long, with &quot;bump-out&quot; areas where users can stop to observe views of Washington and Old Town Alexandria.

The new spans are higher than the old bridge, high enough to allow most boats and small ships to pass underneath without having to raise the bridge and reducing the projected number of annual traffic-hindering openings from about 260 to about 60.

According to a draft executive summary released in December 2022 by the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation for their I-495 Southside Transit/TDM study, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge has &quot;future accommodation for potential future rail transit&quot;. An extension of the Blue Line across the bridge was also proposed at the same time.

<doc id="847339" wikidata="Q4878717" url="?curid=847339" title="Beckhampton Avenue">
<text>The Beckhampton Avenue was a curving prehistoric avenue of stones that ran broadly south west from Avebury towards The Longstones at Beckhampton in the English county of Wiltshire. It probably dates to the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age.

Only one stone, known as Adam, remains standing and even in William Stukeley&#x27;s time (early 18th century) there was little evidence on the surface of the avenue. The other stones were probably broken up and sold by local landowners in the post-medieval era. Excavations by the University of Southampton in 2000, however, revealed the parallel rows of holes that held the stones. 120 m of the avenue was uncovered and indicated that the avenue consisted of a double row of stones placed at 15 m intervals in a similar pattern to those at Kennet Avenue.

Stukeley&#x27;s theory was that the two avenues were part of a giant &#x27;snake&#x27; winding across the landscape with its head at The Sanctuary and also incorporating the Avebury monument.

The avenue may have originally extended further past the Longstones, with Adam being part of the &#x27;cove&#x27; or standing stone arrangement sited along its course. Eve is a known part of the avenue leading back to the western gateway of the henge, which included what is now the village high street.

Before the avenue was built, the site was host to an earlier Neolithic causewayed enclosure.

<text>Blà Bheinn or Blàbheinn, also known as Blaven, is a mountain on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is usually regarded as an outlier of the Black Cuillin range. It is a Munro with a height of . North of the summit is the ridge of Clach Glas, which leads to the peaks of Garbh-bheinn (808 m) and Sgùrr nan Each (720 m). It is mainly composed of gabbro, a rock with excellent grip for mountaineers and scramblers. 

The name is thought to mean &quot;blue mountain&quot;, from a combination of Norse and Gaelic. Whereas in Modern Norwegian means &quot;blue&quot;, the Old Norse word could, however, also refer to the colours blue-black and black.

The normal route of ascent for walkers is from the east. A path leaves the B8083 on the shores of Loch Slapin about 4 km after the village of Torrin. The path follows a burn, the &quot;Allt na Dunachie&quot;, into the corrie of &quot;Coire Uaigneich&quot;. From here a short steep route along the ridge leads to the summit. A small amount of scrambling is needed to reach the true top of the mountain. Alternative routes follow the south ridge, or come from the north having traversed the Clach Glas ridge which links to the Red Cuillin peaks.

Blaven stands in the Strathaird Estate, owned and managed since 1994 by the John Muir Trust.

== In popular culture ==
Blaven is depicted in Mary Stewart&#x27;s 1956 thriller novel &quot;Wildfire at Midnight&quot;.
