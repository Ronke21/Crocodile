<doc id="849750" wikidata="Q6644905" url="?curid=849750" title="List of war crimes">
<text>This article lists and summarizes the war crimes that have violated the laws and customs of war since the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.

Since many war crimes are not prosecuted (due to lack of political will, lack of effective procedures, or other practical and political reasons), historians and lawyers will frequently make a serious case in order to prove that war crimes occurred, even though the alleged perpetrators of these crimes were never formally prosecuted because investigations cleared them of all charges.

Under international law, war crimes were formally defined as crimes during international trials such as the Nuremberg Trials and the Tokyo Trials, in which Austrian, German and Japanese leaders were prosecuted for war crimes which were committed during World War II.

== 1899–1902 Second Boer War ==
The term &quot;concentration camp&quot; was used to describe camps operated by the British Empire in South Africa during the Second Boer War in the years 1900–1902. As Boer farms were destroyed by the British under their &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy, many tens of thousands of women and children were forcibly moved into the concentration camps. Over 26,000 Boer women and children were to perish in these concentration camps.

Six officers from the Bushveldt Carbineers were court-martialed for massacring POWs and civilians. Lieutenants Harry Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton were each found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Morant and Handcock were executed, while Witton was reprieved and served a short prison sentence. Two of the other defendants, Major Robert Lenehan and Lieutenant Henry Picton, were found guilty of lesser charges. They were dismissed from the military and deported from South Africa after being found guilty of neglecting one&#x27;s duty and manslaughter, respectively. The last defendant, Captain Alfred Taylor, was acquitted.

== 1899–1902 Philippine–American War ==
Reported American war crimes and atrocities during the Philippine–American War included the summary execution of civilians and prisoners, burning of villages, and torture. 298,000 Filipinos were also moved to concentration camps, where thousands died.

In November 1901, the Manila correspondent of the &quot;Philadelphia Ledger&quot; wrote: &quot;The present war is no bloodless, opera bouffe engagement; our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women, children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up, the idea prevailing that the Filipino as such was little better than a dog&quot;.

In response to the Balangiga massacre, which wiped out a U.S. company garrisoning Samar town, U.S. Brigadier General Jacob H. Smith launched a retaliatory march across Samar with the instructions: &quot;I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better it will please me. I want all persons killed who are capable of bearing arms in actual hostilities against the United States&quot;.

== 1904–1908: Herero Wars ==

In August, German General Lothar von Trotha defeated the Ovaherero in the Battle of Waterberg and drove them into the desert of Omaheke, where most of them died of dehydration. In October, the Nama people also rebelled against the Germans, only to suffer a similar fate. Between 24,000 and 100,000 Hereros, 10,000 Nama and an unknown number of San died in the parallel Herero and Namaqua genocide. Once defeated, thousands of Hereros and Namas were also imprisoned in concentration camps, where the majority died of diseases, abuse, and exhaustion. German soldiers also regularly engaged in gang rapes before killing the women or leaving them in the desert to die; a number of Herero women were also forced into involuntary prostitution.

== 1912-1913: Balkan Wars ==

The Balkan Wars were marked by ethnic cleansing with all parties being responsible for grave atrocities against civilians and helped inspire later atrocities including war crimes during the 1990s Yugoslav Wars.

Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars were perpetrated on several occasions by Serbian and Montenegrin armies and paramilitaries. According to contemporary accounts, between 20,000 and 25,000 Albanians were massacred in the Kosovo Vilayet during the first two to four months of the conflict; with at least 120,000 being killed in total. Most of the victims were children, women and the elderly. In addition to the massacres, some civilians had their tongues, lips, ears and noses severed. Philip J. Cohen also cited Durham as saying that Serbian soldiers helped bury people alive in Kosovo. &quot;Yugoslavia from a Historical Perspective&quot;, a 2017 study published in Belgrade by the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, said that villages were burned to ashes and Albanian Muslims forced to flee when Serbo-Montenegrin forces invaded Kosovo in 1912. Some chronicles cited decapitation as well as mutilation.

Serbian army also brutally suppressed the Tikveš uprising and terrorized the Bulgarian population in the rebelling regions. According to some sources 363 civilian Bulgarians were killed in Kavadarci, 230 - in Negotino and 40 - in Vatasha.

== 1914–1918: World War I ==

World War I was the first major international conflict to take place following the codification of war crimes at the Hague Convention of 1907, including derived war crimes, such as the use of poisons as weapons, as well as crimes against humanity, and derivative crimes against humanity, such as torture, and genocide. Before, the Second Boer War took place after the Hague Convention of 1899. The Second Boer War (1899 until 1902) is known for the first concentration camps (1900 until 1902) for civilians in the 20th century.

== 1915–1920: First and Second Caco War ==
* During the First (1915) and Second (1918–1920) Caco Wars waged during the United States occupation of Haiti (1915–1934), human rights abuses were committed against the native Haitians population. Overall, American troops and the Haitian gendarmerie killed several thousands of Haitian civilians during the rebellions between 1915 and 1920, though the exact death toll is unknown.
* Mass killings of civilians were allegedly committed by United States Marines and their subordinates in the Haitian gendarmerie. According to Haitian historian Roger Gaillard, such killings involved rape, lynchings, summary executions, burning villages and deaths by burning. Internal documents of the United States Army justified the killing of women and children, describing them as &quot;auxiliaries&quot; of rebels. A private memorandum of the Secretary of the Navy criticized &quot;indiscriminate killings against natives&quot;. American officers who were responsible for acts of violence were given Creole names such as &quot;Linx&quot; for Commandant Freeman Lang and &quot;Ouiliyanm&quot; for Lieutenant Lee Williams. According to American journalist H. J. Seligman, Marines would practice &quot;bumping off Gooks&quot;, describing the shooting of civilians in a manner which was similar to killing for sport.
* During the Second Caco War of 1918–1919, many Caco prisoners were summarily executed by Marines and the gendarmerie on orders from their superiors. On June 4, 1916, Marines executed caco General Mizrael Codio and ten others after they were captured in Fonds-Verrettes. In Hinche in January 1919, Captain Ernest Lavoie of the gendarmerie, a former United States Marine, allegedly ordered the killing of nineteen caco rebels according to American officers, though no charges were ever filed against him due to the fact that no physical evidence of the killing was ever presented.
* The torture of Haitian rebels and the torture of Haitians who were suspected of rebelling against the United States was a common practice among the occupying Marines. Some of the methods of torture included the use of water cure, hanging prisoners by their genitals and &quot;ceps&quot;, which involved pushing both sides of the tibia with the butts of two guns.

==1921–1927: Rif War==
* During the Rif War, Spanish forces used chemical weapons against Berber rebels and civilians in Morocco. These attacks marked the first widespread employment of gas warfare in the post-WWI era. The Spanish army indiscriminately used phosgene, diphosgene, chloropicrin and mustard gas against civilian populations, markets and rivers. Spain signed the Geneva Protocol in 1925, that prohibited chemical and biological warfare, while simultaneously employing these weapons across the Mediterranean.
* According to Miguel Alonso, Alan Kramer and Javier Rodrigo in the book &quot;Fascist Warfare, 1922–1945: Aggression, Occupation, Annihilation&quot;: &quot;Apart from deciding not to use chemical weapons, Franco&#x27;s campaign to &#x27;cleanse Spain&#x27; resembled that in Morocco: intelligence-gathering through torture, summary executions, forced labour, rape, and the sadistic killing of military prisoners.&quot;
* Spanish mutilations of captured Moroccans were reported, including castration and severing heads, noses and ears, which were collected by Spanish legionnaries as war trophies and worn as necklaces or spiked on bayonets.
* On August 9, 1921, the Massacre of Monte Arruit occurred, in which 2,000 soldiers of the Spanish Army were killed by Riffian forces after surrendering the Monte Arruit garrison near Al Aaroui following a 12-day siege.

==1923–1932: Pacification of Libya==
* The Pacification of Libya resulted in mass deaths of the indigenous people in Cyrenaica by Italy. 80,000 or over a quarter of the indigenous people in Cyrenaica perished during the pacification.
* 100,000 Bedouin citizens were ethnically cleansed by expulsion from their land.
* Specific war crimes alleged to have been committed by the Italian armed forces against civilians include deliberate bombing of civilians, killing unarmed children, women, and the elderly, rape and disembowelment of women, throwing prisoners out of aircraft to their death and running over others with tanks, regular daily executions of civilians in some areas, and bombing tribal villages with mustard gas bombs beginning in 1930.

== 1927-1949: Chinese Civil War==
*During the Chinese Civil War both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants deliberately killed by both sides. Benjamin Valentino has estimated atrocities in the Chinese Civil War resulted in the death of between 1.8 million and 3.5 million people between 1927 and 1949.
*Over several years after the 1927 Shanghai massacre, the Kuomintang killed between 300,000 and one million people, primarily peasants, in anti-communist campaigns as part of the White Terror. During the White Terror, the Nationalists specifically targeted women with short hair who had not been subjected to foot binding, on the presumption that such &quot;non-traditional&quot; women were radicals. Nationalist forces cut off their breasts, shaved their heads, and displayed their mutilated bodies to intimidate the populace. From 1946 to 1949, the Nationalists arrested, tortured, and killed political dissidents via the Sino-American Cooperative Organization.
*During the December 1930 Futian incident, the communists executed 2,000 to 3,000 members of the Futian battalion after its leaders had mutinied against Mao Zedong. Between 1931 and 1934 in the Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet, the communist authorities engaged in a widespread campaign of violence against civilians to ensure compliance with its policies and to stop defection to the advancing KMT, including mass executions, land confiscation and forced labor. According to Li Weihan, a high-ranking communist in Jiangxi at the time, in response to mass flight of civilians to KMT held areas, the local authorities authorities would &quot;usually to send armed squads after those attempting to flee and kill them on the spot, producing numerous mass graves throughout the CSR [Chinese Soviet Republic in Jiangxi] that would later be uncovered by the KMT and its allies.&quot; Zhang Wentian, another high-ranking communist, reported that &quot;the policy of annihilating landlords as an exploiting class had degenerated into a massacre&quot; The population of the communist controlled area fell by 700,000 from 1931 and 1935, of which a large proportion were murdered as “class enemies,” worked to death, committed suicide, or died in other circumstances attributable to the communists.
*During the Siege of Changchun the People&#x27;s Liberation Army implemented a military blockade on the KMT-held city of Changchun and prevented civilians from leaving the city during the blockade; this blockade caused the starvation of tens to 150 thousand civilians. The PLA continued to use siege tactics throughout Northeast China.
*At the outbreak of the Chinese Civil War in 1946, Mao Zedong began to push for a return to radical policies to mobilize China against the landlord class, but protected the rights of middle peasants and specified that rich peasants were not landlords. The 7 July Directive of 1946 set off eighteen months of fierce conflict in which all rich peasant and landlord property of all types was to be confiscated and redistributed to poor peasants. Party work teams went quickly from village to village and divided the population into landlords, rich, middle, poor, and landless peasants. Because the work teams did not involve villagers in the process, however, rich and middle peasants quickly returned to power. The Outline Land Law of October 1947 increased the pressure. Those condemned as landlords were buried alive, dismembered, strangled and shot.
*In response to the aforementioned land reform campaign; the Kuomintang helped establish the &quot;Huanxiang Tuan&quot; (), or Homecoming Legion, which was composed of landlords who sought the return of their redistributed land and property from peasants and CCP guerrillas, as well as forcibly conscripted peasants and communist POWs. The Homecoming legion conducted its guerrilla warfare campaign against CCP forces and purported collaborators up until the end of the civil war in 1949.

==1935–1937: Second Italo-Abyssinian War==
* Italian use of mustard gas against Ethiopian soldiers in 1936 violated the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which bans the use of chemical weapons in warfare.
* Crimes by Ethiopian troops included the use of dum-dum bullets (in violation of the Hague Conventions), the killing of civilian workmen (including during the Gondrand massacre), and the mutilation of captured Eritrean Ascari and Italians (often with castration), beginning in the first weeks of war.
* Yekatit 12—In response to the unsuccessful assassination of Rodolfo Graziani on 19 February 1937, thousands of Ethiopians were killed, including all of the monks residing at Debre Libanos, and over a thousand more detained at Danan who were then exiled either to the Dahlak Islands or Italy.
* The Ethiopians recorded 275,000 combatants killed in action, 78,500 patriots (guerrilla fighters) killed during the occupation, 17,800 civilians killed by aerial bombardment and 30,000 in the February 1937 massacre, 35,000 people died in concentration camps, 24,000 patriots executed by Summary Courts, 300,000 people died of privation due to the destruction of their villages, amounting to 760,300 deaths.

==1936–1939: Spanish Civil War==

At least 50,000 people were executed during the Spanish Civil War. In his updated history of the Spanish Civil War, Antony Beevor writes, &quot;Franco&#x27;s ensuing &#x27;white terror&#x27; claimed 200,000 lives. The &#x27;red terror&#x27; had already killed 38,000.&quot; Julius Ruiz concludes that &quot;although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist Spain.&quot;

César Vidal puts the number of Republican victims at 110,965. In 2008 a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzón, opened an investigation into the executions and disappearances of 114,266 people between 17 July 1936 and December 1951. Among the murders and executions investigated was that of poet and dramatist Federico García Lorca.

== 1939–1945: World War II ==
== 1946–1954: Indochina War ==
The French Union&#x27;s struggle against the independence movement backed by the Soviet Union and China claimed 400,000 to 1.5 million Vietnamese lives from 1945 to 1954. In the Haiphong massacre of November 1946, about 6,000 Vietnamese were killed by French naval artillery. The French employed electric shock treatment during interrogations of the Vietnamese, and nearly 10,000 Vietnamese perished in French concentration camps.

According to Arthur J. Dommen, the Viet Minh assassinated 100,000–150,000 civilians during the war, while Benjamin Valentino estimates that the French were responsible for 60,000 to 250,000 civilian deaths.

About French massacres and war crimes during the conflict, Christopher Goscha wrote on &quot;The Penguin History of Modern Vietnam&quot;: &quot;Rape became a disturbing weapon used by the Expeditionary Corps, as did summary executions. Young Vietnamese women who could not escape approaching enemy patrols smeared themselves with any stinking thing they could find, including human excrement. Decapitated heads were raised on sticks, bodies were gruesomely disemboweled, and body parts were taken as &#x27;souvenirs&#x27;; Vietnamese soldiers of all political colors also committed such acts. The non-communist nationalist singer, Phạm Duy, wrote a bone-chilling ballad about the mothers of Gio Linh village in central Vietnam, each of whom had lost a son to a French Army massacre in 1948. Troops decapitated their bodies and displayed their heads along a public road to strike fear into those tempted to accept the Democratic Republic of Vietnam&#x27;s sovereignty. Massacres did not start with the Americans in My Lai, or the Vietnamese communists in Hue in 1968. And yet, the French Union&#x27;s massacre of over two hundred Vietnamese women and children in My Tratch in 1948 remains virtually unknown in France to this day.&quot;

== 1947–1948: Malagasy Uprising ==
During the French suppression of the pro-independence Malagasy Uprising, numerous atrocities were carried out such as mass killings, village burnings, torture, war rape, collective punishment, and throwing live prisoners out of airplanes (death flights). Between 11,000 and 90,000 Malagasy died in the fighting, along with about 800 French soldiers and other Europeans.

== 1948 Arab–Israeli War ==
Several massacres were committed during this war which could be described as war crimes. Nearly 15,000 people, mostly combatants and militants, were killed during the war, including 6,000 Jews and about 8,000 Arabs (mostly Muslims).

== 1945–1949: Indonesian War of Independence ==
* South Sulawesi Campaign, about 4,500 civilians killed by Pro-Indonesian and Indonesian forces and pro-Dutch and Dutch colonial forces (KNIL).
* Rawagede massacre: about 431 civilians killed by Dutch forces
* Bersiap massacre: about 25,000 Indo-European civilians, Dutch, and loyalists killed by Indonesian nationalist forces.
* Indonesian National Revolution: About 100–150,000 Chinese, Communists, Europeans (French, German, British), pro-Dutch etc. were killed by Indonesian nationalist forces and Indonesian youth.

== 1948–1960: Malayan Emergency ==
* War crimes: In the Batang Kali massacre, about 24 unarmed villagers were killed by British troops. The British government claimed that these villagers were insurgents attempting to escape but this was later known to be entirely false as they were unarmed, nor actually supporting the insurgents nor attempting to escape after being detained by British troops. No British soldier was prosecuted for the murder at Batang Kali.
* War crimes: includes beating, torturing, and killing by British troops and communist insurgents of non-combatants.
* War crimes: As part of the Briggs Plan devised by British General Sir Harold Briggs, 500,000 people (roughly ten percent of Malaya&#x27;s population) were eventually removed from the land and interned in guarded camps called &quot;New Villages&quot;. The intent of this measure was to isolate villagers from contact with insurgents. While considered necessary, some of the cases involving the widespread destruction went beyond justification of military necessity. This practice was prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and customary international law which stated that the destruction of property must not happen unless rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.

== 1950–1953: Korean War ==
=== United States perpetrated crimes ===
=== North Korean perpetrated crimes ===

* Rudolph Rummel estimated that the North Korean Army executed at least 500,000 civilians during the Korean War with many dying in North Korea&#x27;s drive to forcibly conscript South Koreans to their war effort. Throughout the conflict, North Korean and Chinese forces routinely mistreated and tortured U.S. and UN prisoners of war. Mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run POW camps during the winter of 1950–51. About 43 percent of all U.S. POWs died during this period. In violation of the Geneva Conventions which explicitly stated that captor states must repatriate prisoners of war to their homeland as quickly as possible, North Korea detained South Korean POWs for decades after the ceasefire. Over 88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing and the Communists&#x27; themselves had claimed they had captured 70,000 South Koreans.

=== South Korean perpetrated crimes ===
== 1952–1960: Mau Mau uprising ==

* In attempt to suppress the insurgency in Kenya, British colonial authorities suspended civil liberties within the country. In response to the rebellion, many Kikuyu were relocated. According to British authorities 80,000 were interned. Caroline Elkins estimated that between 160,000 and 320,000 were moved into concentration camps. Other estimates are as high as 450,000 interned. Most of the remainder – more than a million – were held in &quot;enclosed villages&quot;. Although some were Mau Mau guerillas, many were victims of collective punishment that colonial authorities imposed on large areas of the country. Thousands suffered beatings and sexual assaults during &quot;screenings&quot; intended to extract information about the Mau Mau threat. Later, prisoners suffered even worse mistreatment in an attempt to force them to renounce their allegiance to the insurgency and to obey commands. Significant numbers were murdered; official accounts describe some prisoners being roasted alive. Prisoners were questioned with the help of &quot;slicing off ears, boring holes in eardrums, flogging until death, pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight, and burning eardrums with lit cigarettes&quot;. The British colonial police used a &quot;metal castrating instrument&quot; to cut off testicles and fingers. &quot;By the time I cut his balls off&quot;, one settler boasted, &quot;he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.&quot; According to David Anderson, the British hanged over 1,090 suspected rebels: far more than the French had executed in Algeria during the Algerian War. Another 400 were sentenced to death but reprieved because they were under 18 or women. The British declared some areas prohibited zones where anyone could be shot. It was common for Kikuyu to be shot because they &quot;failed to halt when challenged.&quot;
* The Chuka Massacre, which happened in Chuka, Kenya, was perpetrated by members of the King&#x27;s African Rifles B Company in June 1953 with 20 unarmed people killed during the Mau Mau uprising. Members of the 5th KAR B Company entered the Chuka area on June 13, 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. It is found out that most of the people executed were actually belonged to the Kikuyu Home Guard – a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight an increasingly powerful and audacious guerrilla enemy. The commanding officer of the soldiers responsible, Major Gerald Griffiths, was court-martialed for murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to 7 years in prison. In an atmosphere of atrocity and reprisal, the matter was swept under the carpet and nobody else ever stood trial for the massacre.
* The Hola massacre was an incident during the conflict in Kenya against British colonial rule at a colonial detention camp in Hola, Kenya. By January 1959 the camp had a population of 506 detainees of whom 127 were held in a secluded &quot;closed camp&quot;. This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial &quot;rehabilitation process&quot; or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action – as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards. 77 surviving detainees sustained serious permanent injuries. The British government accepts that the colonial administration tortured detainees, but denies liability.
* The Lari massacre in the settlement of Lari occurred on the night of 25–26 March 1953, in which Mau Mau militants herded Kikuyu men, women and children into huts and set fire to them, killing anyone who attempted to escape. Official estimates place the death toll from the Lari massacre at 74 dead.
* Mau Mau militants also tortured, mutilated and murdered Kikuyu on many occasions. Mau Mau racked up 1,819 murders of their fellow Africans, though again this number excludes the many additional hundreds who &#x27;disappeared&#x27;, whose bodies were never found.

==1954–1962: Algerian War==
The insurgency began in 1945 and was revived in 1954, winning independence in the early 1960s. The French army killed thousands of Algerians in the first round of fighting in 1945. After the Algerian independence movement formed a National Liberation Front (FLN) in 1954, the French Minister of the Interior joined the Minister of National Defense in 1955 in ordering that every rebel carrying a weapon, suspected of doing so, or suspected of fleeing, must be shot. French troops executed civilians from nearby villages when rebel attacks occurred, tortured both rebels and civilians, and interned Arabs in camps, where forced labor was required of some of them. 2,000,000 Algerians were displaced or forcibly resettled during the war, and over 800 villages were destroyed from 1957 to 1960.

Other French crimes included deliberate bombing, torture and mutilation of civilians, rape and sexual assaults, disembowelment of pregnant women, imprisonment without food in small cells, throwing detainees from helicopters and into the sea with concrete on their feet, and burying people alive.

The FLN also indulged in a large amount of atrocities, both against French pieds-noirs and against fellow Algerians whom they deemed as supporting the French or simply as refusing to support the Liberation effort. These crimes included killing unarmed children, women and the elderly, rape and disembowelment or decapitation of women and murdering children by slitting their throats or banging their heads against walls. French sources estimated that 70,000 Muslim civilians were killed, or abducted and presumed killed, by the FLN during the war. The FLN also killed 30,000 to 150,000 in people in post-war reprisals.

==1955–1975: Vietnam War==
===United States perpetrated crimes===
During the war 95 U.S. Army personnel and 27 U.S. Marine Corps personnel were convicted by court-martial of the murder or manslaughter of Vietnamese.

* &quot;Vietnam War Crimes Working Group&quot; – Briefly declassified (1994) and subsequently reclassified (2002) documentary evidence compiled by a Pentagon task force detailing endemic war crimes committed by U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. Substantiating 320 incidents by Army investigators, includes seven massacres from 1967 through 1971 in which at least 137 South Vietnamese civilians died (not including the ones at My Lai), 78 other attacks on noncombatants in which at least 57 were killed, 56 wounded and 15 sexually assaulted, and 141 instances in which U.S. soldiers tortured civilian detainees or prisoners of war.

===South Korean perpetrated crimes===
=== North Vietnamese and Vietcong perpetrated crimes ===

* Up to 155,000 refugees fleeing the final North Vietnamese Spring Offensive were alleged to have been killed or abducted on the road to Tuy Hòa in 1975.

== Late 1960s – 1998: The Troubles ==
* War crimes: Various unarmed male civilians (some of whom were named during a 2013 television programme) were shot, two of them (Patrick McVeigh, Daniel Rooney) fatally, in 1972, allegedly by the Military Reaction Force (MRF), an undercover military unit tasked with targeting Irish Republican Army paramilitaries during the last installment of the Troubles. Two brothers, whose names and casualty status were not mentioned in an article regarding the same matter in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, ran a fruit stall in west Belfast, and were shot after being mistaken for IRA paramilitaries.
* War crimes: The British security forces employed widespread torture and waterboarding on prisoners in Northern Ireland during interrogations in the 1970s. Liam Holden was wrongfully arrested by the security forces for the murder of a British Army soldier and became the last person in the United Kingdom to be sentenced to hang after being convicted in 1973, largely on the basis of an unsigned confession produced by torture. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he spent 17 years behind bars. On 21 June 2012, in the light of CCRC investigations which confirmed that the methods used to extract confessions were unlawful, Holden had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in Belfast, at the age of 58. Former Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) interrogators during the Troubles admitted that beatings, the sleep deprivation, waterboarding, and the other tortures were systematic, and were, at times, sanctioned at a very high level within the force.
* War crimes: The British Army and the RUC also operated under a shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland, under which suspects were alleged to have been deliberately killed without any attempt to arrest them. In four separate cases considered by the European court of human rights – involving the deaths of ten IRA men, a Sinn Féin member and a civilian – seven judges ruled unanimously that Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights guaranteeing a right to life had been violated by Britain.
* War crimes: British soldiers and police colluded with loyalist paramilitaries, such as the attacks by the Glenanne group, which carried out a string of attacks against Irish Catholics and nationalists in an area of Northern Ireland known as the &quot;murder triangle&quot; and also carried out some attacks in the Republic of Ireland. Evidence suggests that the group was responsible for the deaths of about 120 civilians. The &quot;Cassel Report&quot; investigated 76 killings attributed to the group and found evidence that British security forces were involved in 74 of those. One former member, RUC officer John Weir, said his superiors knew of the group&#x27;s activities but allowed it to continue. Attacks attributed to the group include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings (which killed 34 civilians), the Miami Showband killings, the Reavey and O&#x27;Dowd killings and the Hillcrest Bar bombing.

== 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War ==
==1970–1975: Cambodian civil war==
The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the Prosecution of Crimes Committed During the Period of Democratic Kampuchea, commonly known as the Cambodia Tribunal, is a joint court established by the Royal Government of Cambodia and the United Nations to try senior members of the Khmer Rouge for crimes against humanity committed during the Cambodian Civil War. The Khmer Rouge killed many people due to their political affiliation, education, class origin, occupation, or ethnicity.

==1973 Yom Kippur war==
==1975–1999: Indonesian invasion and occupation of East Timor==
During the 1975 invasion and the subsequent occupation, a significant portion of East Timor&#x27;s population died. Researcher Ben Kiernan says that &quot;a toll of 150,000 is likely close to the truth&quot;, although estimates of 200,000 or higher have been suggested.

== 1975–1990: Lebanese Civil War ==
== 1978–2021: Civil war in Afghanistan ==
This war ravaged the country for over 40 years, with several foreign actors playing important roles during different periods. From 2001 until 2021, US and other NATO troops took part in the fighting in Afghanistan in the &quot;War on Terror&quot; that is also treated in the corresponding section below.

During the war against the Coalition and Afghan government, the Taliban committed war crimes including massacres, suicide bombing, terrorism, and targeting civilians. United Nations reports have consistently blamed the Taliban and other anti-government forces for the majority of civilian deaths in the conflict, with the Taliban responsible for 75% of civilian deaths in 2011. The Taliban also perpetrated mass rapes and executions of surrendered soldiers.

Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has also executed civilians and captured insurgents during the ongoing Republican insurgency in Afghanistan.

== 1980–1988: Iran–Iraq War ==

Over 100,000 civilians other than those killed in Saddam&#x27;s genocide are estimated to have been killed by both sides of the war by R.J.Rummel.

== 1986–1994: Uganda ==
&quot;The Times&quot; reports (November 26, 2005 p. 27):

Almost 20 years of fighting... has killed half a million people. Many of the dead are children... The LRA [a cannibalism cult] kidnaps children and forces them to join its ranks. And so, incredibly, children are not only the main victims of this war, but also its unwilling perpetrators... The girls told me they had been given to rebel commanders as &quot;wives&quot; and forced to bear them children. The boys said they had been forced to walk for days knowing they would be killed if they showed any weakness, and in some cases forced even to murder their family members... every night up to 10,000 children walk into the centre of Kitgum... because they are not safe in their own beds... more than 25,000 children have been kidnapped ...this year an average of 20 children have been abducted every week.
* The International Criminal Court has launched an investigation and has issued indictments against LRA leaders.

== 1990–2000: Liberia / Sierra Leone ==
From &quot;The Times&quot; March 28, 2006 p. 43:
: &quot;&quot;Charles Taylor, the former Liberian President who is one of Africas most wanted men, has gone into hiding in Nigeria to avoid extradition to a UN war crimes tribunal... The UN war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone holds Mr Taylor responsible for about 250,000 deaths. Throughout the 1990s, his armies and supporters, made up of child soldiers orphaned by the conflict wreaked havoc through a swath of West Africa. In Sierra Leone he supported the Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F) whose rebel fighters were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians.&quot;
* Current action – Indicted on 17 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the UN, which has issued an international warrant for his arrest. As of April 2006 located, extradited, and facing trial in Sierra Leone but then transferred to the Netherlands as requested by the Liberian government. As of the status of the main state actor in the war crimes in Liberia, Sierra Leone and the ongoing war crimes tribunal in the Hague for violating the UN sanctions, Libya&#x27;s Muamar Gaddafi was elected to the post of President of the African Union. As of late January, 2011, Exxon/Mobile has resumed explorationary drilling in Libya after the exchange of the Lockerbie bombing terrorist was returned to Libya and Libya was taken off terrorist list by the Bush administration with the legal stipulation that Libya could never be prosecuted for past war crimes(regardless of guilt)in the future.

== 1990: Gulf War ==
== 1991–2000/2002: Algerian Civil War ==
During the Algerian Civil War of the 1990s, a variety of massacres occurred through the country, many being identified as war crimes. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has avowed its responsibility for many of them, while for others no group has claimed responsibility. In addition to generating a widespread sense of fear, these massacres and the ensuing flight of population have resulted in serious depopulation of the worst-affected areas. The massacres peaked in 1997 (with a smaller peak in 1994), and were particularly concentrated in the areas between Algiers and Oran, with very few occurring in the east or in the Sahara.

== 1994–1996/1999–2009: Russia-Chechnya Wars ==
During the First Chechen War (1994–1996) and Second Chechen War (1999–2000 battle phase, 2000–2009 insurgency phase) there were many allegations of war crimes and terrorism against both sides from various human rights organizations.

== 1998–2006: Second Congo War ==

* Civil war 1998–2002, est. 5 million deaths; war &quot;sucked in&quot; Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, as well as 17,000 United Nations peacekeepers, its &quot;largest and most costly&quot; peace mission and &quot;the bloodiest conflict since the end of the Second World War.&quot;
* Fighting involves Mai-Mai militia and Congolese government soldiers. The Government originally armed the Mai-Mai as civil defence against external invaders, who then turned to banditry.
* 100,000 refugees living in remote disease ridden areas to avoid both sides
* Estimated 1000 deaths a day according to Oxfam:
: &quot;The army attacks the local population as it passes through, often raping and pillaging like the militias. Those who resist are branded Mai-mai supporters and face detention or death. The Mai-mai accuse the villagers of collaborating with the army, they return to the villages at night and . Sometimes they march the villagers into the bush to work as human mules.&quot;
* In 2003, Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of Mbuti Pygmies, told the UN&#x27;s Indigenous People&#x27;s Forum that during the Congo Civil War, his people were hunted down and eaten as though they were game animals. Both sides of the war regarded them as &quot;subhuman&quot;. Makelo asked the UN Security Council to recognise cannibalism as a crime against humanity and an act of genocide.

== 2003–2017: Iraqi conflict ==
During the Iraq War
* Blackwater Baghdad shootings On September 16, 2007, Blackwater military contractors shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square, Baghdad. The fatalities occurred while a Blackwater Personal Security Detail (PSD) was escorting a convoy of US State Department vehicles en route to a meeting in western Baghdad with United States Agency for International Development officials. The shooting led to the unraveling of the North Carolina-based company, which since has replaced its management and changed its name to Xe Services.
* Beginning in 2004, accounts of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, including torture, rape, sodomy, and homicide of prisoners held in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq (also known as Baghdad Correctional Facility) came to public attention. These acts were committed by military police personnel of the United States Army together with the CIA. In January 2014, evidence accuses British troops of being involved in widespread torture and abuse towards Iraqi civilians and prisoners.
* War crimes: 2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing by Al-Qaeda. The bombing was followed by retaliatory violence with over a hundred dead bodies being found the next day and well over 1,000 people killed in the days following the bombing – by some counts, over 1,000 on the first day alone.
* The Mahmudiyah rape and killings were the gang-rape and murder of 14-year-old Iraqi girl Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi and the murder of her family by United States Army soldiers on March 12, 2006. It occurred in the family&#x27;s house to the southwest of Yusufiyah, a village to the west of the town of Al-Mahmudiyah, Iraq. Other members of al-Janabi&#x27;s family murdered by Americans included her 34-year-old mother Fakhriyah Taha Muhasen, 45-year-old father Qassim Hamza Raheem, and 6-year-old sister Hadeel Qassim Hamza Al-Janabi. The two remaining survivors of the family, 9-year-old brother Ahmed and 11-year-old brother Mohammed, who were at school during the massacre, were orphaned by the event.
* War crimes: Iraqi insurgent groups have committed many armed attacks and bombings targeting civilians. According to Iraqi Interior Minister Bayan Jabr insurgents killed over 12,000 Iraqis from January 2005 to June 2006, giving the first official count for the victims of bombings, ambushes and other deadly attacks. Iraq Body Count project data shows that 33% of civilian deaths during the Iraq War resulted from execution after abduction or capture. These were overwhelmingly carried out by unknown actors including insurgents, sectarian militias and criminals. See: Iraq War insurgent attacks, List of suicide bombings in Iraq since 2003 and List of massacres of the Iraq War for a more comprehensive list.
== 2006 Lebanon War ==
Allegations of war crimes in the 2006 Lebanon War refer to claims of various groups and individuals, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and United Nations officials, who accused both Hezbollah and Israel of violating international humanitarian law during the 2006 Lebanon War, and warned of possible war crimes. These allegations included intentional attacks on civilian populations or infrastructure, disproportionate or indiscriminate attacks in densely populated residential districts.

According to various media reports, between 1,000 and 1,200 Lebanese citizens (including Hezbollah fighters) were reported dead; there were between 1,500 and 2,500 people wounded and over 1,000,000 were temporarily displaced. Over 150 Israelis were killed (120 military); thousands wounded; and 300,000–500,000 were displaced because of Hezbollah firing tens of thousands of rockets at major cities in Israel.

== 2003–2020 War in Darfur and Chadian Civil War ==

During the War in Darfur and the Chadian Civil War, reports of humans rights abuses and genocide surfaced, accusing the Sudanese Armed Forces and Janjaweed militias in Darfur and Eastern Chad.

Sudanese authorities claim a death toll of roughly 19,500 civilians while many non-governmental organizations, such as the Coalition for International Justice, claim over 400,000 people have been killed.

In September 2004, the World Health Organization estimated there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to starvation. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the six-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticised, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence. A more recent British Parliamentary Report has estimated that over 300,000 people have died, and others have estimated even more.

== 2008–2009 Gaza War ==
There were allegations of war crimes by both the Israeli military and Hamas. Criticism of Israel&#x27;s conduct focused on the proportionality of its measures against Hamas, and on its alleged use of weaponised white phosphorus. Numerous reports from human right groups during the war claimed that white phosphorus shells were being used by Israel, often in or near populated areas. In its early statements the Israeli military denied using any form of white phosphorus, saying &quot;We categorically deny the use of white phosphorus&quot;. It eventually admitted to its limited use and stopped using the shells, including as a smoke screen. The Goldstone report investigating possible war crimes in the 2009 war accepted that white phosphorus is not illegal under international law but did find that the Israelis were &quot;systematically reckless in determining its use in build-up areas&quot;. It also called for serious consideration to be given to the banning of its use as an obscurant.

== 1983 - 2009 Sri Lankan Civil War ==
There are allegations that war crimes were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during the Sri Lankan Civil War, particularly during the final months of the conflict in 2009. The alleged war crimes include attacks on civilians and civilian buildings by both sides; executions of combatants and prisoners by the government of Sri Lanka; enforced disappearances by the Sri Lankan military and paramilitary groups backed by them; acute shortages of food, medicine, and clean water for civilians trapped in the war zone; and child recruitment by the Tamil Tigers.

A panel of experts appointed by UN Secretary-General (UNSG) Ban Ki-moon to advise him on the issue of accountability with regard to any alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the final stages of the civil war found &quot;credible allegations&quot; which, if proven, indicated that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tigers. The panel has called on the UNSG to conduct an independent international inquiry into the alleged violations of international law. The Sri Lankan government has denied that its forces committed any war crimes and has strongly opposed any international investigation. It has condemned the UN report as &quot;fundamentally flawed in many respects&quot; and &quot;based on patently biased material which is presented without any verification&quot;.

== 2011–Present: Syrian civil war ==


International organizations have accused the Syrian government, ISIL and other opposition forces of severe human rights violations, with many massacres occurring. Chemical weapons have been used many times during the conflict as well. The Syrian government is reportedly responsible for the majority of civilian casualties and war crimes, often through bombings. In addition, tens of thousands of protesters and activists have been imprisoned and there are reports of torture in state prisons. Over 470,000 people were killed in the war by 2017.

== 2015–present: Kurdish–Turkish conflict ==

According to the U.S. State Department 2016 Human Rights Report, in February 2016, Turkish security forces killed at least 130 people, including unarmed civilians, who had taken shelter in the basements of three buildings in the town of Cizre. A domestic NGO, The Human Rights Association (HRA), said the security forces killed more than 300 civilians in the first eight months of 2016. In March 2017, the United Nations voiced &quot;concern&quot; over the Turkish government&#x27;s operations and called for an independent assessment of the &quot;massive destruction, killings and numerous other serious human rights violations&quot; against the ethnic Kurdish minority.

== 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war ==

UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that &quot;indiscriminate attacks on populated areas anywhere, including in Stepanakert, Ganja and other localities in and around the immediate Nagorno-Karabakh zone of conflict, were totally unacceptable&quot;. Amnesty International stated that both Azerbaijani and Armenian forces committed war crimes during recent fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, and called on Azerbaijani and Armenian authorities to immediately conduct independent, impartial investigations, identify all those responsible, and bring them to justice.

== 2020–2022: Tigray War ==

During the Tigray War, which included fighting between the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) soldiers and Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in the Tigray Region, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) described the 9–10 November 2020 Mai Kadra massacre committed by Tigray youth group &quot;Samri&quot; in its 24 November 2020 preliminary report as &quot;grave human rights violations which may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes&quot;.

== 2022–present: Russo-Ukrainian War==


During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, multiple buildings such as airports, hospitals, kindergartens were bombed. There has been abuse of prisoners of war.

In April 2022 bodies of civilians murdered by Russian forces were found in the town of Bucha, which had been left after the occupation of the town. It was confirmed at least more than 300 bodies were in mass graves or stranded on the streets of the city. As of 22 April 2022 there have been more than 500 confirmed bodies.

The Siege of Mariupol started on 24 February 2022 and ended on 20 May 2022. It has been confirmed at thousands of lives have been claimed through the siege and that the city has been reduced to rubble.

On 21 April 2022, Satellite images showed mass graves around the besieged city of Mariupol. It has been confirmed at least 9,000+ bodies have been found since. On the same day Vladimir Putin ordered troops to blockade the Azovstal Steel Plant, the last Ukrainian controlled place in the besieged city of Mariupol. The steel plant had more than 1,000 Ukrainians confirmed inside of it.

On 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Russia&#x27;s Commissioner for Children&#x27;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for war crimes of deportation and illegal transfer of children from occupied Ukraine to Russia.

On 13 June 2023, Russian troops murdered 6 civilians in Sumy Oblast near Seredyna-Buda, mutilated their bodies, and then mined the place to kill people who tried to retrieve their bodies. They also blocked retrieval of bodies for 2 more days. This case is currently being investigated by Ukrainian authorities.


== 2023–2025: Israel–Hamas war ==

An ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas began on 7 October 2023 with a coordinated surprise attack on Israel.

In April 2024, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) adopted a resolution calling for Israel to be held accountable for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, and demanding a halt to all arms sales to the country. 28 countries voted in favor, 13 abstained, and six voted against. Israel&#x27;s ambassador accused the UN of anti-Israeli bias.

<text>Soyuz 38 was a human spaceflight mission conducted by the Soviet Union during September 1980. The Soyuz spacecraft brought two visiting crew members to the Salyut 6 space station, one of whom was an Intercosmos cosmonaut from Cuba.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 6800 kg
*Perigee: 199.7 km
*Apogee: 273.5 km
*Inclination: 51.63°
*Period: 88.194 minutes

==Mission highlights==
12th expedition to Salyut 6. 7th international crew. Carried Intercosmos cosmonaut from Cuba. The Soyuz 38 docking occurred in darkness. As the spacecraft approached Salyut 6, the crew on the space station could see only its &quot;headlights&quot;.
Ryumin filmed ignition and operation of the transport&#x27;s main engine.
Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez of Cuba and Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko docked without incident.

The purpose of the Soyuz 38 mission was to carry out nine experiments. They stimulated different areas of the brain to further understand the electrical activity in our brain. This was done using a customized helmet for each cosmonaut with silver electrodes and a tape recorder. The cosmonauts also wore special shoes to study the structure and motion of feet changes during weightlessness. They also collaborated with the Cuban Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases to examine blood and urine samples throughout the entire launch, stay, and return to explore the psychological stress from preparation and working long hours under constant weightlessness. Another experiment they conducted was centered around studying changes in the levels of skeletal muscle structure. They used a Cuban made instrument to assess the adipose tissue and the stimulation of body fat. There was also a study on blood circulation, which sought to determine the impact weightlessness has on the human circulatory system. Tests had been carried out in previous flights and were repeated during this mission using a Chibis suit, a below-the-waist reduced-pressure device. Crew members completed exercise protocols wearing the Chibis to provide gravity-simulating stress to the body&#x27;s cardiovascular/circulatory system and re-establishing the body&#x27;s orthostatic tolerance after extended periods of microgravity. Negative pressure on the legs causes blood to accumulate in the lower extremities, which is the case in a gravity environment. Orthostatic intolerance has been a frequent complaint in humans returning from long-duration space flights. The other experiments attempted to study how cell division, the immune system, concentrations of antibodies and other proteins and minerals were affected after prolonged exposure to a weightless environment. This included measurements into the amount and rate at which humans lost water, fat, and other minerals.The cosmonauts also studied the growth of a single crystal of sucrose in the same environment.

<doc id="849758" wikidata="Q769100" url="?curid=849758" title="52nd Street (Manhattan)">
<text>52nd Street is a one-way street traveling west to east across Midtown Manhattan, New York City, United States. A short section of it was known as the city&#x27;s center of jazz performance from the 1930s to the 1950s.

==Jazz center==
Following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, 52nd Street replaced 133rd Street as &quot;Swing Street&quot; of the city. The blocks of 52nd Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues became renowned for the abundance of jazz clubs and lively street life. The street was convenient to musicians playing on Broadway and the &#x27;legitimate&#x27; nightclubs and was also the site of a CBS studio. Musicians who played for others in the early evening played for themselves on 52nd Street.

In the period from 1930 through the early 1950s, 52nd Street clubs hosted such jazz musicians as Louis Prima, Art Tatum, Fats Waller, Billie Holiday, Trummy Young, Harry Gibson, Nat Jaffe, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Marian McPartland, and many more. Although musicians from all schools performed there, after Minton&#x27;s Playhouse in uptown Harlem, 52nd Street was the second most important place for the dissemination of bebop. In fact, a tune called &quot;52nd Street Theme&quot; by Thelonious Monk became a bebop anthem and jazz standard.

Virtually every great jazz player and singer of the era performed at clubs:

52nd Street, between 6th &amp; 7th Avenues

Disc jockey Symphony Sid frequently did live broadcasts from the street which were transmitted across the country.

By the late 1940s, the jazz scene began moving elsewhere around the city and urban renewal began to take hold of the street. By the 1960s, most of the legendary clubs were razed or fell into disrepair. The last jazz club there closed in 1968, though one remains as a restaurant. Today, the street is full of banks, shops, and department stores and shows little trace of its jazz history. The block from 5th to 6th Avenues is formally co-named &quot;Swing Street&quot; and one block west is called &quot;W. C. Handys Place&quot;.

The 21 Club was the sole surviving club on 52nd Street that also existed during the 1940s. It closed in 2020. The venue for the original Birdland at 1674 Broadway (between 52nd &amp; 53rd), which came into existence in 1949, is now a strip club. The current Birdland is on 44th Street, between 8th and 9th Avenues.

==Notable places on 52nd Street==
This is a list of notable places within one block of 52nd Street.

<doc id="849761" wikidata="Q694151" url="?curid=849761" title="Order of the Iron Crown (Kingdom of Italy)">
<text>The Order of the Iron Crown () was an order of merit that was established on 5 June 1805 in the Kingdom of Italy by Napoleon Bonaparte under his title of Napoleon I, King of Italy.

The order took its name from the ancient Iron Crown of Lombardy, a medieval jewel with what was thought to be an iron ring, later shown to be of silver, forged from what was supposed to be a nail from the True Cross as a band on the inside. This crown also gave its name to the Order of the Crown of Italy, which was established in 1868.

After the fall of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1814, the order was re-established in 1815 by the Emperor of Austria, Francis I, as the Austrian Imperial Order of the Iron Crown.

==Significance of the Iron Crown==
The Iron Crown of Lombardy was allegedly made for Roman emperor Constantine and crafted from the iron of one of the nails in the True Cross used in the Crucifixion of Jesus. Thus came the term of “Iron Crown”. It was allegedly gifted by Pope Gregory I to Theodelinda, Queen of the Lombards, who donated it to the Church upon her death in 628. Afterwards, the crown would have been used for the coronation of the Lombard kings and of Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne, when he took the throne of Lombardy in 774. 

Regardless of origin, the crown is crafted of six hinged plates of gold, set with precious gems, and held together with a circlet structure of white metal underneath. It was most probably a votive crown and the white metal band within has proven to be crafted of silver rather than iron. From the 14th c. onwards, the crown was seen as the most prominent insignia of the Italian kingship. It was therefore used during the coronation of later Holy Roman Emperors as kings of Italy. 

It is now kept in the treasury of the Cathedral of Monza.

==Establishment of the order==
During his continued expansion of power, Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Italy in much the same manner as Charlemagne. As a symbolic gesture, he had himself crowned as King of Italy using the Iron Crown of Lombardy for the coronation, which occurred on 26 May 1805.

Soon after, Napoleon founded the Order of the Iron Crown on 5 June 1805. The order was divided into three classes, with an allowance of up to 20 grand cross knights, 100 commander knights, and 500 ordinary knights.

With the eventual end of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, the original order ceased to exist. However, the Emperor of Austria, Francis I, re-established the order in 1815 as the Austrian Imperial Order of the Iron Crown.

==Insignia==
The ribbon colors of the order were gold and green, with the badge of the order being an imperial eagle set upon a representation of the Iron Crown of Lombardy.

* Knights wore a traditional military-style medal on the left chest.
* Commanders wore a traditional military-style medal on the left chest, with the addition of a rosette in the center of the ribbon to distinguish them from ordinary knights. 
* Holders of the Grand Cross wore a sash over the right shoulder and a neck badge, along with a six-pointed breast star (that featured the Iron Crown at its center) on the left breast.

<text>Economic order quantity (EOQ), also known as financial purchase quantity or economic buying quantity, is the order quantity that minimizes the total holding costs and ordering costs in inventory management. It is one of the oldest classical production scheduling models. The model was developed by Ford W. Harris in 1913, but the consultant R. H. Wilson applied it extensively, and he and K. Andler are given credit for their in-depth analysis.

==Overview==
The EOQ indicates the optimal number of units to order to minimize the total cost associated with the purchase, delivery, and storage of a product.

EOQ applies only when demand for a product is constant over a period of time (such as a year) and each new order is delivered in full when inventory reaches zero. There is a fixed cost for each order placed, regardless of the quantity of items ordered; an order is assumed to contain only one type of inventory item. There is also a cost for each unit held in storage, commonly known as holding cost, sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item. Although the EOQ formulation is straightforward, factors such as transportation rates and quantity discounts factor into its real-world application.

The required parameters to the solution are the total demand for the year, the purchase cost for each item, the fixed cost to place the order for a single item and the storage cost for each item per year. Note that the number of times an order is placed will also affect the total cost, though this number can be determined from the other parameters.

===Variables===
*formula_1 = total annual inventory cost
*formula_2 = purchase unit price, unit production cost
*formula_3 = order quantity
*formula_4 = optimal order quantity
*formula_5 = annual demand quantity
*formula_6 = fixed cost per order, setup cost (&quot;not&quot; per unit, typically cost of ordering and shipping and handling. This is not the cost of goods)
*formula_7 = annual holding cost per unit, also known as carrying cost or storage cost (capital cost, warehouse space, refrigeration, insurance, opportunity cost (price x interest), etc. usually not related to the unit production cost)

===Total cost function and derivation of EOQ formula===

The single-item EOQ formula finds the minimum point of the following cost function:

Total Cost = purchase cost or production cost + ordering cost + holding cost

Where:

* Purchase cost: This is the variable cost of goods: purchase unit price × annual demand quantity. This is formula_8.
* Ordering cost: This is the cost of placing orders: each order has a fixed cost formula_6, and we need to order formula_10 times per year. This is formula_11
* Holding cost: the average quantity in stock (between fully replenished and empty) is formula_12, so this cost is formula_13

: formula_14.

To determine the minimum point of the total cost curve, calculate the derivative of the total cost with respect to Q (assume all other variables are constant) and set it equal to 0:

: formula_15

Solving for Q gives Q* (the optimal order quantity):

: formula_16

Therefore:

 &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

Q* is independent of P; it is a function of only K, D, h.

The optimal value Q* may also be found by recognizing that

: formula_17
where the non-negative quadratic term disappears for formula_18 which provides the cost minimum formula_19

=== Example ===
*Annual requirement quantity (D) = 10000 units
*Cost per order (K) = 40
*Cost per unit (P)= 50
*Yearly carrying cost per unit = 4
*Market interest = 2%

Economic order quantity = formula_20 formula_21 = 400 units

Number of orders per year (based on EOQ) formula_22

Total cost formula_23

Total cost formula_24

If we check the total cost for any order quantity other than 400(=EOQ), we will see that the cost is higher. For instance, supposing 500 units per order, then

Total cost formula_25

Similarly, if we choose 300 for the order quantity, then

Total cost formula_26

This illustrates that the economic order quantity is always in the best interests of the firm.

==Extensions of the EOQ model==

===Quantity discounts===
An important extension to the EOQ model is to accommodate quantity discounts. There are two main types of quantity discounts: (1) all-units and (2) incremental. Here is a numerical example:
* Incremental unit discount: Units 1–100 cost $30 each; Units 101–199 cost $28 each; Units 200 and up cost $26 each. So when 150 units are ordered, the total cost is $30*100 + $28*50.
* All units discount: an order of 1–1000 units costs $50 each; an order of 1001–5000 units costs $45 each; an order of more than 5000 units costs $40 each. So when 1500 units are ordered, the total cost is $45*1500.

In order to find the optimal order quantity under different quantity discount schemes, one should use algorithms; these algorithms are developed under the assumption that the EOQ policy is still optimal with quantity discounts. Perera et al. (2017) establish this optimality and fully characterize the (s,S) optimality within the EOQ setting under general cost structures.

===Design of optimal quantity discount schedules===
In presence of a strategic customer, who responds optimally to discount schedules, the design of an optimal quantity discount scheme by the supplier is complex and has to be done carefully. This is particularly so when the demand at the customer is itself uncertain. An interesting effect called the &quot;reverse bullwhip&quot; takes place where an increase in consumer demand uncertainty actually reduces order quantity uncertainty at the supplier.

===Backordering costs and multiple items===
Several extensions can be made to the EOQ model, including backordering costs and multiple items. In the case backorders are permitted, the inventory carrying costs per cycle are:

: formula_27

where s is the number of backorders when order quantity Q is delivered and formula_28 is the rate of demand. The backorder cost per cycle is:

: formula_29

where formula_30 and formula_31 are backorder costs, formula_32, T being the cycle length and formula_33. The average annual variable cost is the sum of order costs, holding inventory costs and backorder costs:

: formula_34

To minimize formula_35 impose the partial derivatives equal to zero:

: formula_36
: formula_37

Substituting the second equation into the first gives the following quadratic equation:

: formula_38

If formula_39 either s=0 or formula_40 is optimal. In the first case the optimal lot is given by the classic EOQ formula, in the second case an order is never placed and minimum yearly cost is given by formula_41. If formula_42 or formula_43 formula_44 is optimal, if formula_45 then there shouldn&#x27;t be any inventory system. If formula_46 solving the preceding quadratic equation yields:

: formula_47
: formula_48

If there are backorders, the reorder point is: formula_49; with m being the largest integer formula_50 and μ the lead time demand.

Additionally, the economic order interval can be determined from the EOQ and the economic production quantity model (which determines the optimal production quantity) can be determined in a similar fashion.

A version of the model, the Baumol-Tobin model, has also been used to determine the money demand function, where a person&#x27;s holdings of money balances can be seen in a way parallel to a firm&#x27;s holdings of inventory.

Malakooti (2013) has introduced the multi-criteria EOQ models where the criteria could be minimizing the total cost, Order quantity (inventory), and Shortages.

A version taking the time-value of money into account was developed by Trippi and Lewin.

=== Imperfect quality ===
Another important extension of the EOQ model is to consider items with imperfect quality. Salameh and Jaber (2000) were the first to study the imperfect items in an EOQ model very thoroughly. They consider an inventory problem in which the demand is deterministic and there is a fraction of imperfect items in the lot and are screened by the buyer and sold by them at the end of the circle at discount price.

==Implementation==
Dave Piasecki identifies two ways in which use of an EOQ approach may be implemented:
*a spreadsheet method, whereby the EOQ for each stock item is calculated and recorded manually
*entry of the EOQ formula into a new or existing inventory management system.
He suggests that a system-based implementation would be beneficial where the number of stock-keeping units is over around 2000. Annual updating of data and formulae are recommended. A hybrid system would involve downloading data into a spreadsheet for calculation purposes and then re-applying this data within the inventory system.

==Criticisms==
The EOQ model and its sister, the economic production quantity model (EPQ), have been criticised for &quot;their restrictive set[s] of assumptions. Guga and Musa make use of the model for an Albanian business case study and conclude that the model is &quot;perfect theoretically, but not very suitable from the practical perspective of this firm&quot;. However, James Cargal notes that the formula was developed when business calculations were undertaken &quot;by hand&quot;, or using logarithmic tables or a slide rule. Use of spreadsheets and specialist software allows for more versatility in the use of the formula and adoption of &quot;assumptions which are more realistic&quot; than in the original model.

<text>Family Life is a magazine published by, and primarily for, the Old Order Amish. The publisher is Pathway Publishers of Aylmer, Ontario, Canada. Unlike some Amish publications, &quot;Family Life&quot; is printed entirely in English rather than Pennsylvania Dutch or German.

The magazine was founded in 1968 and is published monthly. It contains articles, poetry, recipes, and drawings submitted by readers. It also has several regular columns on subjects such as health, nature, and religion. Like its primary readership, &quot;Family Life&quot; magazine stresses simplicity, basic Christian doctrine, and an agricultural lifestyle.

Exact circulation figures are unavailable. The magazine does have some non-Amish readership, including Mennonites. It is used as a reference by some scholars, sociologists, and anthropologists who study the Amish. In addition to &quot;Family Life&quot;, Pathway produces two companion publications: &quot;Blackboard Bulletin&quot;, concerning schooling and education, and &quot;Young Companion&quot;, focusing on youth issues.

<doc id="849764" wikidata="Q915432" url="?curid=849764" title="Soyuz T-3">
<text>Soyuz T-3 was a Soviet spaceflight, launched on 27 November 1980 to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the first Soyuz spacecraft to carry three cosmonauts following the fatal Soyuz 11 disaster in 1971.

The mission was both an early flight of the new Soyuz-T variant craft, as well as one of the later flights to the Salyut 6 station, which had successfully received several crews and visiting craft in recent years. Unlike previous habitations of the station, the crew of Soyuz T-3 did not receive any visitors, and thus did not exchange Soyuz craft with other crews for a return journey, a common practice.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission summary==
Although the main objective of the crew&#x27;s mission was to refurbish Salyut 6, part of their mission also involved testing their spacecraft. During their brief stay on Salyut 6, the crew performed experiments using the Splav and Kristall units, and studied biological material which had been carried aboard their Soyuz using the Svetoblok and Oazis units. Much of their time, however, was devoted to station maintenance.

On 2 December they began conducting the Mikroklimat experiment to assess the station&#x27;s living conditions, and began work on the thermal control system. They installed a new hydraulic unit with four pumps. On 4 December, they replaced electronics in the station&#x27;s telemetry system. 5 December saw them repairing electrical system faults. Other repairs included replacement of a program and timing device in the onboard control system and replacement of a power supply unit for the compressor in the refueling system. The Salyut 6 Principal Expedition 4 crew in TsUP provided the crew with advice as they made their repairs. On 8 December, Progress 11 carried out an orbital correction for the complex.

Upon leaving the station the craft&#x27;s orbital module was left attached to Salyut 6 for a few hours, while its descent and service modules completed procedures for re-entry. This procedure was also used during the undocking of Soyuz T-4. Soyuz T-3 returned to Earth on 11 December 1980, landing west of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakh SSR.

<text>Soyuz T-4 was a Soviet space mission which launched the crew of Salyut 6 EO-6, the sixth and final long-duration crew of the Salyut 6 space station. It was launched on 12 March 1981 and docked with the station the next day. During their stay, the EO-6 crew was visited by Soyuz 39 and Soyuz 40. Soyuz T-4 returned to Earth on 26 May 1981; its crew were the last to have inhabited Salyut 6.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 6850 kg
*Perigee: 201 km
*Apogee: 250 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 88.7 minutes

==Mission highlights==
The docking with Salyut 6 was delayed after the Soyuz&#x27;s onboard Argon computer determined it would occur outside radio range with the TsUP. Despite this, the docking occurred successfully on 13 March 1981. The Progress 12 spacecraft was already docked to the station by the time the crew arrived, and they spent several days unloading the Progress before its undocking on 19 March. This freed the remaining docking port for the arrival of the Soyuz 39/EP-9 crew on 22 March.

In mid-May, Kovalyonok and Savinykh replaced the spacecraft&#x27;s probe with a Salyut drogue. This may have been an experiment to see if a Soyuz-T docked to a space station could act as a rescue vehicle in the event that an approaching Soyuz-T equipped with a probe experienced docking difficulties and could not return to Earth.

The EO-6 crew undocked from Salyut 6 on 26 May, leaving behind the Soyuz&#x27;s orbital module. Soyuz T-4 landed over three hours later, touching down east of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakh SSR.

<doc id="849779" wikidata="Q1783548" url="?curid=849779" title="Bond convexity">
<text>In finance, bond convexity is a measure of the non-linear relationship of bond prices to changes in interest rates, and is defined as the second derivative of the price of the bond with respect to interest rates (duration is the first derivative). In general, the higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond price is to the change in interest rates. Bond convexity is one of the most basic and widely used forms of convexity in finance. Convexity was based on the work of Hon-Fei Lai and popularized by Stanley Diller. 

== Calculation of convexity ==
Duration is a linear measure or 1st derivative of how the price of a bond changes in response to interest rate changes. As interest rates change, the price is not likely to change linearly, but instead it would change over some curved function of interest rates. The more curved the price function of the bond is, the more inaccurate duration is as a measure of the interest rate sensitivity.

Convexity is a measure of the curvature or 2nd derivative of how the price of a bond varies with interest rate, i.e. how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes. Specifically, one assumes that the interest rate is constant across the life of the bond and that changes in interest rates occur evenly. Using these assumptions, duration can be formulated as the first derivative of the price function of the bond with respect to the interest rate in question. Then the convexity would be the second derivative of the price function with respect to the interest rate.

Convexity does not assume the relationship between Bond value and interest rates to be linear. In actual markets, the assumption of constant interest rates and even changes is not correct, and more complex models are needed to actually price bonds. However, these simplifying assumptions allow one to quickly and easily calculate factors which describe the sensitivity of the bond prices to interest rate changes.

== Why bond convexities may differ ==

The price sensitivity to parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates is highest with a zero-coupon bond and lowest with an amortizing bond (where the payments are front-loaded). Although the amortizing bond and the zero-coupon bond have different sensitivities at the same maturity, if their final maturities differ so that they have identical bond durations then they will have identical sensitivities. That is, their prices will be affected equally by small, first-order, (and parallel) yield curve shifts. They will, however, start to change by different amounts with each &quot;further&quot; incremental parallel rate shift due to their differing payment dates and amounts.

For two bonds with the same par value, coupon, and maturity, convexity may differ depending on what point on the price yield curve they are located.

==Mathematical definition==

If the &quot;flat&quot; floating interest rate is &quot;r&quot; and the bond price is , then the convexity is defined as

:formula_1

Another way of expressing is in terms of the modified duration :

:formula_2

Therefore,

:formula_3

leaving

:formula_4

Where is a Modified Duration

===How bond duration changes with a changing interest rate===

Return to the standard definition of modified duration:

:formula_5

where is the present value of coupon , and is the future payment date.

As the interest rate increases, the present value of longer-dated payments declines in relation to earlier coupons (by the discount factor between the early and late payments). However, bond price also declines when interest rate increases, but changes in the present value of sum of each coupons times timing (the numerator in the summation) are larger than changes in the bond price (the denominator in the summation). Therefore, increases in must decrease the duration (or, in the case of zero-coupon bonds, leave the unmodified duration constant). Note that the modified duration differs from the regular duration by the factor one over (shown above), which also decreases as is increased.

:formula_6

Given the relation between convexity and duration above, conventional bond convexities must always be positive.

The positivity of convexity can also be proven analytically for basic interest rate securities. For example, under the assumption of a flat yield curve one can write the value of a coupon-bearing bond as formula_7, where stands for the coupon paid at time . Then it is easy to see that

:formula_8

Note that this conversely implies the negativity of the derivative of duration by differentiating formula_9.

==Application of convexity==

#Convexity is a risk management figure, used similarly to the way &#x27;gamma&#x27; is used in derivatives risks management; it is a number used to manage the market risk a bond portfolio is exposed to. If the combined convexity and duration of a trading book is high, so is the risk. However, if the combined convexity and duration are low, the book is hedged, and little money will be lost even if fairly substantial interest movements occur. (Parallel in the yield curve)
#The second-order approximation of bond price movements due to rate changes uses the convexity:

:: formula_10

==Effective convexity==
For a bond with an embedded option, a yield to maturity based calculation of convexity (and of duration) does not consider how changes in the yield curve will alter the cash flows due to option exercise. To address this, an effective convexity must be calculated numerically. Effective convexity is a discrete approximation of the second derivative of the bond&#x27;s value as a function of the interest rate:

: formula_11

where formula_12 is the bond value as calculated using an option pricing model, formula_13 is the amount that yield changes, and formula_14 are the values that the bond will take if the yield falls by &quot;formula_15&quot; or rises by &quot;formula_15&quot;, respectively (a parallel shift).

These values are typically found using a tree-based model, built for the &quot;entire&quot; yield curve, and therefore capturing exercise behavior at each point in the option&#x27;s life as a function of both time and interest rates; see .

<text>Soyuz 39 was a 1981 Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the fifteenth expedition, and carried the eighth international crew to the orbiting facility. The crew visited Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh, who had reached Salyut-6 ten days prior.

The flight carried Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Jügderdemidiin Gürragchaa into space. With this mission, Gürragchaa became the first Mongolian, and second Asian cosmonaut.

The Mongolian contribution for this mission had begun in 1967, when the president of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences Bazaryn Shirendev attended a conference of scientists from socialist countries in Moscow, where the Intercosmos project was announced. Dzhanibekov and Gürragchaa performed about thirty experiments during the course of the mission.

==Mission highlights==

Soyuz 39 docked with the first Mongolian cosmonaut aboard. The resident EO-6 crew assisted the Intercosmos crew with station equipment and oriented the station according to the needs of the visiting crew&#x27;s experiments.

On 24 March, the cosmonauts installed cosmic ray detectors in the station&#x27;s work and transfer compartments. On 26 March the cosmonauts performed the Illuminator (&quot;viewing port&quot;) experiment, which studied the degradation of the station&#x27;s viewports. On 27 March, Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh of the resident crew used the Gologramma (&quot;hologram&quot;) apparatus to image a viewing port damaged by micrometeoroids. They repeated this experiment the next day, when they also collected samples of the station&#x27;s air and microflora and removed the cosmic ray detectors for return to Earth. 28–29 March were largely devoted to studies of Mongolia from space. The visiting crew also checked out their spacecraft on 29 March

The Soviet news service TASS noted that by 29 March, Salyut 6 had conducted 20,140 revolutions of Earth.

<doc id="849789" wikidata="Q3178832" url="?curid=849789" title="Orlando Cabrera">
<text>Orlando Luis Cabrera Ramírez (born November 2, 1974), nicknamed &quot;O-Cab&quot; and &quot;the OC&quot;, is a Colombian-American former baseball infielder.

He won the 2004 World Series championship with the Boston Red Sox. He also played for the Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, Minnesota Twins, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians and San Francisco Giants. Cabrera is the younger brother of former major leaguer Jolbert Cabrera.

Cabrera won the Gold Glove Award in 2001 and in 2007. He announced his retirement before the 2012 season.

==Baseball career==

===Montreal Expos (1997–2004)===
Cabrera signed with the Expos as a non-drafted free agent in 1993. He made his major league debut on September 3, 1997 against the Boston Red Sox, entering as a defensive replacement for Mark Grudzielanek at shortstop and finishing the game 0-for-2. Cabrera recorded his first major league hit, a single, off New York Mets pitcher Rick Reed on September 11. On July 18, 1999, Cabrera popped up to end David Cone&#x27;s perfect game.

In 2002, he led all major league ballplayers in errors, totaling 29.

In 2003, Cabrera finished second among the league shortstops in batting average (.297), slugging percentage (.415), runs batted in (80), and stolen base percentage (24-to-26). In addition, he was one of four Expos players to have played all 162 games in a season, and the first to do it twice. Also, his 17 home runs that season were the most ever by a shortstop in Expos history.

Since the Expos traded Cabrera to the Red Sox in 2004, he appeared in six of the seven MLB postseasons, and at least once with every team he spent the end of the season with (2004 with Boston, 2005 and 2007 with Los Angeles, 2008 with Chicago, 2009 with Minnesota, and 2010 with Cincinnati).

===Boston Red Sox (2004)===
Cabrera was traded to the Boston Red Sox on July 31, 2004 as part of a four-team trade. Cabrera batted .294 with six home runs and 31 RBIs in 58 games with the Red Sox. He also brought stability to the shortstop position. The trade, which also netted first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz from the Twins, shored up Boston&#x27;s infield defense and energized the team, which went 42–19 after the deal to win the American League&#x27;s wild card (56–45 before the trade). &quot;He is a game-changer in the field for me&quot;, Curt Schilling said. He hit a home run on his first at-bat with the Red Sox on August 1, becoming the eighth Boston player to accomplish the feat. In Game 2 of the 2004 ALDS, he hit a bases-clearing double, helping the Red Sox sweep the Anaheim Angels. Boston went on to win its first World Series title since 1918 with a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2005–07)===
Following his 2004 World Series victory with the Red Sox, Cabrera agreed to a four-year, $32 million contract as a free agent with the Anaheim Angels (later renamed Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim) on December 20, 2004. He replaced David Eckstein at shortstop. Also reuniting him with his former Expos teammate Vladimir Guerrero.

In 2007, Cabrera led qualified AL shortstops with a .983 fielding percentage and a league-low 11 errors, earning him the American League Gold Glove for shortstop, the first by an Angel shortstop since Jim Fregosi in 1967. Also, he stole 20 bases for the third straight year and the fifth time overall.

Cabrera had a 63-game on-base streak in early-through-mid-2006, which was the sixth-longest streak of all time. Ted Williams holds the Major League record with 84 straight games reaching base. Cabrera also had a straight steal of home plate on July 2, 2006, the first such time it had been accomplished by an Angels player since 1997. Cabrera scored without a throw.

===Chicago White Sox (2008)===
On November 19, 2007, Cabrera was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with cash considerations for Jon Garland. Cabrera&#x27;s one season with White Sox was marred with controversy: arguing with manager Ozzie Guillén, leaving the clubhouse early to avoid the media, calling the press box to have errors overturned, questioning his team&#x27;s attitude, and kicking dirt at Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Grant Balfour during an at-bat in Game 1 of the AL Divisional Series.

===Oakland Athletics (2009)===
On March 6, 2009, Cabrera signed a one-year deal and played middle infield with the Oakland Athletics. In 101 games with the A&#x27;s, he batted .280 with four home runs and 41 RBI in 101 games.

===Minnesota Twins (2009)===
On July 31, 2009, Cabrera was traded to the Minnesota Twins with cash considerations for shortstop Tyler Ladendorf.

In 2009, Cabrera led all major league players in errors, with 25. He had a solid offensive year, finishing the season batting .284, with 186 hits (fourth among all shortstops), nine home runs and 77 RBI (first among AL shortstops and fourth out of all shortstops) in 160 games. His seventh-inning, two-run home run in the American League Central Division&#x27;s tiebreaker game on October 6, 2009, kept the Twins in the game, which they later won, 6–5, in the 12th inning, to advance to post-season play.

===Cincinnati Reds (2010)===
On February 1, 2010, Cabrera signed a one-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds that included a mutual option for 2011. Cabrera spent the season as the Reds shortstop and posted a .263 average with four home runs, 42 RBI, and a .303 on-base percentage. Cabrera played in only 123 games due to a strained oblique muscle that kept him on the DL from August 3 to September 3. The injury continued to bother him in September and into the playoffs, culminating with Dusty Baker giving him the start in Game 3 of the NLDS despite Cabrera mentioning pain. In the first inning, Cabrera made a high throw to first that allowed a run to score. While on the disabled list, Cabrera spent one game in full batboy uniform, bringing balls to the umpire and collecting bats.

The Reds declined the option for 2011 on his contract with a $1 million buyout. Reds general manager Walt Jocketty expressed that he wanted to bring back Cabrera at a price lower than the $4 million option.

===Cleveland Indians (2011)===

On February 10, 2011, Cabrera signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. With Asdrúbal Cabrera in place at shortstop, Cabrera switched to playing second base. On June 12, 2011, Cabrera got his 2,000th hit in Yankee Stadium off of pitcher Freddy García.

On July 21, Jason Kipnis was called up to share duties with Cabrera, who had hit .172 in the month of July and .244/.275/.323 for the season.

===San Francisco Giants (2011)===
On July 30, 2011, Cabrera was traded to the San Francisco Giants for minor league outfielder Thomas Neal. He was originally given the number 6, but opted to wear number 43, out of respect for J. T. Snow.

===Retirement===
On January 18, 2012, Cabrera announced his retirement on a radio show in his native home country of Colombia. In November of the same year, his brother Jolbert said Orlando could have come out of retirement and played for the Colombia national baseball team if they had advanced to the final round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

==Personal life==
Cabrera became a naturalized U.S. citizen on May 19, 2011, in South Carolina. Cabrera, a Colombian national, had faced extra scrutiny when traveling through customs due to Colombia&#x27;s reputation for drug trafficking. , he lives in Windham, New Hampshire, with his wife Katie Cabrera.

<text>Slow match, also called match cord, is the slow-burning cord or twine fuse used by early gunpowder musketeers, artillerymen, and soldiers to ignite matchlock muskets, cannons, shells, and petards. Slow matches were most suitable for use around black-powder weapons because a slow match could be roughly handled without going out, and only presented a small glowing tip instead of a large flame that risked igniting nearby gunpowder. Slow match of various types was one of the first kinds of artillery fuse.

Slow matches were also used in the drilling and blasting of rock to ignite charges of gunpowder.

== Design and use ==

The slow match attached to the lock of the matchlock gun was usually a length of hemp or flax cord that had been chemically treated to make it burn slowly and consistently for an extended period. In Japan, however, match cord was made from braiding together strands of bark from the Japanese cypress. The rate of burning was approximately 1 ft (305mm) per hour. The British Army estimated that a single soldier on guard duty, for one year, could use an entire mile&#x27;s worth of match cord. In practical use on a matchlock, both ends of the match cord were often ignited, as the flash of gunpowder in the flash pan could extinguish one end of the match cord, and the remaining end could then be used to reignite the firing end of the cord upon reloading the matchlock musket. To prevent dragging the match cord on wet ground, a linstock, a forked wooden support inserted into the ground and used for holding the end of the match cord furthest removed from the matchlock, was typically carried.

Many formulas for match cord exist, providing varying burn rates. The predominant chemical used was potassium nitrate, although sodium nitrate, and lead(II) acetate also appear to have been used. Potassium nitrate had an advantage over sodium nitrate, being less likely to absorb atmospheric moisture.

Match cord was often used from the 15th century until about 1630, when the flintlock started its rise to prominence. (The arrival of the snaplock after 1540 had only limited impact on match cord use, snaplocks generally being considered a peasant&#x27;s weapon.) Match cord remained in use with limited numbers of matchlocks in Europe until approximately 1730, and in Japan until the early 1900s. Even once it became obsolete for small arms use, some artillery users (notably the Royal Navy) continued to deploy it as a backup until the end of the flintlock era.

Historic England published a well illustrated account of the investigation of conservation work on a slow match pouch found in the intertidal zone at Medmerry, West Sussex, now in the collection of the National Museum of the Royal Navy.

== Modern use and replacements ==

Modern-day slow match (used with replica matchlock firearms) is sometimes made of cotton cord, instead of hemp, due to legalities associated with growing hemp plants.

For faster burning and modern-day applications such as for igniting fireworks, either tubed black match (sometimes termed quick match) or punk are generally used instead of slow match.

<text>The Soyuz 40 mission was a 1981 Soviet crewed spaceflight and the final flight of the Soyuz 7K-T spacecraft. It was a collaboration between the Soviet Union and Romania.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 6800 kg
*Perigee: 198.1 km
*Apogee: 287 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 89.06 minutes

==Mission highlights==
Soyuz 40 was the 16th expedition to Salyut 6 and carried the ninth international crew. It also ended the first phase of the Intercosmos program by carrying Romanian cosmonaut Dumitru Prunariu and Soviet cosmonaut Leonid Popov to the station. In all, nine Intercosmos missions were launched between 1978 and 1981.

Soyuz 40 was the last of the original Soyuz spacecraft (due to its replacement by the Soyuz-T) and the last Soyuz spacecraft to dock with Salyut 6. During the crew&#x27;s stay, Prunariu studied the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Earth observations had to be delayed until the last day of the flight, when Salyut 6 passed over Romania in daylight. During this time the crew also tested the station&#x27;s orientation system.

<doc id="849804" wikidata="Q2585806" url="?curid=849804" title="MIVEC">
<text>MIVEC (Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing Electronic Control system) is the brand name of a variable valve timing (VVT) engine technology developed by Mitsubishi Motors. MIVEC, as with other similar systems, varies the timing of the intake and exhaust camshafts which increases the power and torque output over a broad engine speed range while also being able to help spool a turbocharger more quickly and accurately.

MIVEC was first introduced in 1992 in their &quot;4G92&quot; powerplant, a 1,597 cc naturally aspirated DOHC 16 valve straight-4. At the time, the first generation of the system was named &quot;Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing and lift Electronic Control&quot;. The first cars to use this were the Mitsubishi Mirage hatchback and the Mitsubishi Lancer sedan. While the conventional &quot;4G92&quot; engine provided at 7000 rpm, the MIVEC-equipped engine could achieve at 7500 rpm. Similar improvements were seen when the technology was applied to the 1994 Mitsubishi FTO, whose top-spec GPX variant had a &quot;6A12&quot; 1997 cc DOHC 24 valve V6 with peak power of at 7500 rpm. The GR model, whose otherwise identical powerplant was not MIVEC-equipped, produced at 7000 rpm by comparison.

Although initially designed to enhance performance, the system has subsequently been developed to improve economy and emissions, and has been introduced across Mitsubishi&#x27;s range of vehicles, from the Mitsubishi i kei car to the high-performance Lancer Evolution sedan to the Mirage/Space Star global economy car.

Newest developments have led to MIVEC system being evolved into a continuous variable valve timing and also being the first VVT system to be used into a passenger car diesel engine.

==Operation==

Variable valve control systems optimize more power and torque by varying valve opening times and/or duration. Some of these valve control systems optimize performance at low and mid-range engine speeds, while others focus on enhancing only high-rpm power. The MIVEC system provides both of these benefits by controlling valve timing and lift. The basic operation of the MIVEC system is altering the cam profiles and thus tailoring engine performance in response to driver input.

In essence, MIVEC serves the same function as &quot;swapping cams&quot;, something that car racers might do when modifying older-design engines to produce more power. However, such swaps come with a compromise - generally yielding either greater low-end torque or more high-end horsepower, but not both. MIVEC achieves both goals. With MIVEC, the &quot;cam swap&quot; occurs automatically at a fixed engine speed. The Cam Switch operation is transparent to the driver, who is simply rewarded with a smooth flow of power.

Two distinct cam profiles are used to provide two engine modes: a low-speed mode, consisting of low-lift cam profiles; and a high-speed mode. The low-lift cams and rocker arms - which drive separate intake valves - are positioned on either side of a centrally located high-lift cam. Each of the intake valves is operated by a low-lift cam and rocker arm, while placing a T-lever between them allows the valves to follow the action of the high-lift cam.

At low speeds, The T-lever&#x27;s wing section floats freely, enabling the low-lift cams to operate the valves. The intake rocker arms contain internal pistons, which are retained by springs in a lowered position while the engine speed is below the MIVEC switchover point, to avoid contacting the high-lift T-shaped levers. At high speeds, hydraulic pressure elevates the hydraulic pistons, causing the T-lever to push against the rocker arm, which in turn makes the high-lift cam operate the valves.

MIVEC switches to the higher cam profile as engine speed increases, and drops back to the lower cam profile as engine speed decreases. The reduced valve overlap in low-speed mode provides stable idling, while accelerated timing of the intake valve&#x27;s closing reduces backflow to improve volumetric efficiency, which helps increase engine output as well as reduce lift friction. High-speed mode takes advantage of the pulsating intake effect created by the mode&#x27;s high lift and retarded timing of intake valve closure. The resulting reduced pumping loss of the larger valve overlap yields higher power output and a reduction in friction. The low- and high-speed modes overlap for a brief period, boosting torque.

From the &quot;4B1&quot; engine family onward, MIVEC has evolved into a continuous variable valve timing (CVVT) system (dual VVT on intake and exhaust valves). Many older implementations only vary the valve timing (the amount of time per engine revolution that the intake port is open) and not the lift. Timing is continuously independently controlled to provide four optimized engine-operating modes:
*Under most conditions, to ensure highest fuel efficiency, valve overlap is increased to reduce pumping losses. The exhaust valve opening timing is retarded for higher expansion ratio, enhancing fuel economy.
*When maximum power is demanded (high engine speed and load), intake valve closing timing is retarded to synchronize the intake air pulsations for larger air volume.
*Under low-speed, high load, MIVEC ensures optimal torque delivery with the intake valve closing timing advanced to ensure sufficient air volume. At the same time, the exhaust valve opening timing is retarded to provide a higher expansion ratio and improved efficiency.
*At idle, valve overlap is eliminated to stabilize combustion.

Mitsubishi&#x27;s &quot;4N1&quot; engine family is the world&#x27;s first to feature a variable valve timing system applied to passenger car diesel engines.

==MIVEC-MD==

In the early years of developing its MIVEC technology, Mitsubishi also introduced a variant dubbed MIVEC-MD (Modulated Displacement), a form of variable displacement. Under a light throttle load, the intake and exhaust valves in two of the cylinders would remain closed, and the reduced pumping losses gave a claimed 10–20 percent improvement in fuel economy. Modulated Displacement was dropped around 1996.

<text>The National Lubricating Grease Institute is an international trade association that serves the grease and gear lubricant industry. It exists to promote research and development of lubrication technology. It also publishes industry standards for greases.
== History ==

The NLGI was incorporated by a small number of U.S. companies in 1933 to create a code for the National Recovery Act. The original name of the organization was the &quot;National Association of Lubricating Grease Manufacturers, Inc&quot;. The name was changed in 1937 as the industry recognized the need for a joint development and standards association and membership grew.

The NLGI is a not-for-profit corporation whose membership includes grease manufacturers and sales organizations, associated equipment manufacturers, industry suppliers, service organizations, research and educational groups. Membership is open to corporations and individuals.

According to information posted by the NLGI in 2004, the institute has member organizations in 26 countries, while subscriptions to its journal, the &quot;NLGI Spokesman&quot;, represent 50 countries.

== Standards ==

In cooperation with ASTM International and SAE International, the NLGI has developed the categorisation of lubricating greases specified in standard &quot;“standard classification and specification for automotive service greases”&quot;, reproduced in standard &quot;“automotive lubricating greases”&quot;. The NLGI retains jurisdiction over the designation and definition of the categories, which it publishes in its &quot;“chassis and wheel bearing service classification system”&quot;. The NLGI has also created a symbol, the &quot;NLGI Certification Mark&quot;, which can be used on containers of greases to advertise their category.

The measure of the consistency of a lubricating grease is commonly expressed by its NLGI consistency number, defined by the NLGI in the &quot;“standard classification of lubricating grease”&quot;. The NLGI consistency number is used in several standards: , and &quot;“lubricants, industrial oils and related products (class L) — classification — part 9: family X (greases)”&quot;.

The NLGI also administers a professional certification program. Individuals passing an examination designed to test their knowledge in the field of lubricating grease obtain the &quot;Certified Lubricating Grease Specialist&quot; (CLGS) certification.

<text>USS &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; (DD-850) is a former United States Navy .
The ship was named after Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., a naval aviator, son of the former U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., and older brother of future President John F. Kennedy. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; served, with interruptions for modernization, until 1973. Among the highlights of her service are the blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the afloat recovery teams for &quot;Gemini 6&quot; and &quot;Gemini 7&quot;. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; is on display as a museum ship in Battleship Cove, Fall River, Massachusetts. She was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989 as one of a small number of surviving &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyers.

==1945–1950==
USS &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; was built by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard at Quincy, Massachusetts, launched on 26 July 1945, sponsored by Miss Jean Kennedy, sister of Lieutenant Kennedy. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; was commissioned at Boston on 15 December 1945.

The new destroyer sailed on 4 February 1946 for shakedown training in the Caribbean. Robert F. Kennedy, Joseph&#x27;s brother, then 20 years old, sailed on this cruise as an apprentice seaman. Kennedy was discharged from the navy on 30 May 1946.

&quot;Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.&quot; returned to her homeport, Newport, in April 1946, and was occupied for the next few months in Naval Reserve Training. Arriving Norfolk on 8 October, the ship joined Admiral William D. Leahy&#x27;s flagship, , and other units for a cruise to Chile and Venezuela. She transited the Panama Canal twice on this voyage, and was reviewed by the President of Venezuela on 25 November 1946. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; returned to her home port on 14 December 1946.

During 1947 the destroyer operated on the East Coast and in the Caribbean. She sailed for fleet maneuvers off Puerto Rico on 9 February and upon completion steamed eastward to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. During this period of great unrest in Europe, the fleet carried out the important role of peacekeeper and stabilizer. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; visited various Mediterranean ports before arriving Newport on 26 June 1948. The remainder of the year was spent in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises, and the first half of 1949 saw her make two training cruises to the Caribbean.

The ship sailed on 23 August 1949 for 6th Fleet duty as flagship of Destroyer Squadron 18 (DESRON 18), returning on 27 January 1950.

==1950–1960==
With the advent of war in Korea, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; carried out reserve training during July 1950, followed by bombardment and convoy exercises to prepare for action defending South Korea from Communist aggression. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; sailed for Japan on 3 January 1951 by way of the Panama Canal, Pearl Harbor, and Midway Atoll. At Sasebo she loaded ammunition and, exactly one month after departure from Newport, joined Task Force 77 (TF 77) off Korea. From February to April she screened the attack carriers as they pounded enemy positions and supply lines. She departed on 8 April for the Formosa Patrol, helping to prevent further hostilities across the volatile Taiwan Straits. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;, then returned to Korea arriving off Wonsan on 20 May to take up bombardment station in support of the Allied siege and occupation of harbor islands. This duty continued until 13 June, a period of almost constant bombardment of great importance to the operation, after which the ship steamed to Sasebo.

&quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; did not return to the West Coast immediately upon the termination of this combat duty, but instead steamed westward to complete a circumnavigation of the globe. With other units of Destroyer Squadron 8, she visited Singapore, Bahrain, Port Said, Naples, and Gibraltar before returning to Newport on 9 August 1951. Until January 1953 she conducted battle practice and served as school ship for the Fleet Training School at Newport. She sailed on 7 January for another 6th Fleet cruise, returning to Newport on 18 May 1953. Antisubmarine training exercises and another Mediterranean cruise January – May 1954 comprised her duty through most of 1955, and she sailed on 5 November for Arctic maneuvers off northern Europe. The ship visited Oslo, Norway, and Bremerhaven, West Germany, carrying out tactical exercises with units of the 6th Fleet before returning to Newport on 5 March 1956.

In June 1956, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; arrived at Annapolis with battleships and to embark United States Naval Academy midshipmen for a training cruise. Upon returning from Northern Europe on 1 August, the ship took part in training operations until 6 May 1957, when she sailed once more for 6th Fleet duty. The Jordanian crisis had just passed with the strong support of the fleet, and &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; took part in carrier operations until September, when she steamed to the coast of Norway for NATO joint maneuvers. She returned to Newport on 22 October 1957. Again in 1958 the ship sailed to the Mediterranean, and on this cruise spent April in the Persian Gulf with the Middle East Force before arriving back to Newport on 1 July 1958.

After a needed period of overhaul at Boston, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;, arrived at Annapolis once more on 3 June 1959 for midshipman training. Along with other ships of the task group, she entered the St. Lawrence River and represented the Navy at the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway on 26 June 1959. Following the ceremonies, in which both President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II took part, the destroyer entered the Seaway and steamed to Chicago on 2 July. The ship visited various ports before returning to the Atlantic on 6 August. In 1960 she returned to the Mediterranean with and , returning to Newport on 15 October.

==1961–1964==

In January 1961 &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;, steamed to Washington, D.C. for the inauguration of John F. Kennedy, brother of her namesake. During February and April of that year she took part in space shots in the Project Mercury series. She then arrived New York City on 1 July 1961 for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul in the New York Naval Shipyard. During this period she received the latest in antisubmarine gear, a new helicopter flight deck and hangar aft, and numerous other modifications designed to increase her useful life. After emerging in her new dress in late May 1962, she underwent exhaustive shakedown out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, returning on 26 August 1962.

&quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;, with other ships of the fleet, reacted quickly to the threat of Soviet ballistic missiles in Cuba, and President Kennedy&#x27;s quarantine order. Sailing on 22 October, the ship took an active part in the blockade that forced an easing of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and on 26 October under the command of Commander Nicholas S. Mikhalevsky sent a boarding party to the Lebanese Liberty ship &quot;Marucla&quot; After participating in this graphic demonstration of the power and mobility of the US Navy, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; remained on patrol in the Caribbean until returning to Newport on 7 December 1962.

During 1963 the veteran destroyer carried out training operations off the Virginia Capes and Nova Scotia. She departed Newport on 29 April 1964 for another Med cruise until 26 August, and in October was underway for Operation Steel Pike I, one of the largest amphibious operations since World War II. During the passage of the task force to the Spanish coast, she acted as antisubmarine screening ship. &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; returned to Newport on 19 November 1964.

==1965–1967==
Late in January 1965, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;, put to sea for Port Canaveral, Florida, where she helped qualify two newly constructed Polaris submarines for patrol overseas. There followed a regular 3-month overhaul in the Boston Naval Shipyard.
Commander J. W. Hayes took over command of &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; from Captain J. V. Peters on 14 July; the next day, a 2-month period of refresher training commenced as the ship set sail for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The US crewed space program was one of &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot;″s more recent commitments; leaving Newport on 27 November 1965, the ship took station southeast of Bermuda as part of the afloat recovery team for &quot;Gemini 6&quot; and &quot;Gemini 7&quot; on a 14-day orbital and rendezvous mission in space. The shots a success and her duty done, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; returned to Newport on 21 December to prepare for another deployment in the Mediterranean.

Assigned to DESRON 10, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; departed Newport on 15 February 1966 for duty with the 6th Fleet. After arriving at Gibraltar on 24 February, she participated during the next four months in AAW and ASW operations and ranged the Mediterranean from the North African coast to Turkey. She completed her peace-keeping patrols late in June and returned to Newport on 8 July.

During the remainder of the year she conducted destroyer exercises and carrier screening operations off the eastern seaboard. In mid-November she participated in recovery operations following the successful 4-day flight of &quot;Gemini 12&quot;. On 1 March 1967 &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; again sailed for duty with the 6th Fleet. She cruised the Mediterranean until late April, and then transited the Suez Canal for the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. Late in June she departed the Gulf of Aden for the United States. Steaming via the Cape of Good Hope and South America, she arrived Newport the following month. There she resumed readiness training.

==End of career==
As part of the Navy drawdown resulting from the end of US involvement in Vietnam, the &quot;Kennedy&quot; was decommissioned in early 1973 and was stricken from the Navy Register on 1 July the same year. Due to her famous namesake and close association with the Kennedy family, plans were soon made for her preservation.

==Museum ship==

After decommissioning, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1973 and removed to Fall River, Massachusetts, as a unit of the Battleship Cove Museum. She is open to the public as the official memorial to Massachusetts citizens who gave their lives during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. She is also home to the Admiral Arleigh Burke National Destroyermen&#x27;s Museum.

In the spring of 2000, &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; was brought to Rhode Island Sound for the movie &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, portraying both herself and . The ship was crewed by active duty Navy and Naval Reservists in period uniforms, and some systems (radar antennae, gun mounts, and ASW torpedo tubes) were made semi-operational for action scenes, with the ship being towed by a tugboat that was kept out of frame during filming.

==Awards==
Note – The &quot;Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.&quot; displays the ribbon of the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal at Battleship Cove in Fall River; however, the vessel was not in the area of eligibility for this medal during the appropriate time period.

<text>The Kepler space telescope is a defunct space telescope launched by NASA in 2009 to discover Earth-sized planets orbiting other stars. Named after astronomer Johannes Kepler, the spacecraft was launched into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. The principal investigator was William J. Borucki. After nine and a half years of operation, the telescope&#x27;s reaction control system fuel was depleted, and NASA announced its retirement on October 30, 2018.

Designed to survey a portion of Earth&#x27;s region of the Milky Way to discover Earth-size exoplanets in or near habitable zones and to estimate how many of the billions of stars in the Milky Way have such planets, Kepler&#x27;s sole scientific instrument is a photometer that continually monitored the brightness of approximately 150,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. These data were transmitted to Earth, then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by exoplanets that cross in front of their host star. Only planets whose orbits are seen edge-on from Earth could be detected. Kepler observed 530,506 stars, and had detected 2,778 confirmed planets as of June 16, 2023.
==History==
===Pre-launch development===
The Kepler space telescope was part of NASA&#x27;s Discovery Program of relatively low-cost science missions. The telescope&#x27;s construction and initial operation were managed by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with Ball Aerospace responsible for developing the Kepler flight system.

In January 2006, the project&#x27;s launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA. It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems. During this time, the high-gain antenna was changed from a design using a gimbal to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month.

===Post launch===
The Ames Research Center was responsible for the ground system development, mission operations since December 2009, and scientific data analysis. The initial planned lifetime was three and a half years, but greater-than-expected noise in the data, from both the stars and the spacecraft, meant additional time was needed to fulfill all mission goals. Initially, in 2012, the mission was expected to be extended until 2016, but on July 14, 2012, one of the four reaction wheels used for pointing the spacecraft stopped turning, and completing the mission would only be possible if the other three all remained reliable. Then, on May 11, 2013, a second one failed, disabling the collection of science data and threatening the continuation of the mission.

On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that they had given up trying to fix the two failed reaction wheels. This meant the current mission needed to be modified, but it did not necessarily mean the end of planet hunting. NASA had asked the space science community to propose alternative mission plans &quot;potentially including an exoplanet search, using the remaining two good reaction wheels and thrusters&quot;. On November 18, 2013, the K2 &quot;Second Light&quot; proposal was reported. This would include utilizing the disabled Kepler in a way that could detect habitable planets around smaller, dimmer red dwarfs. On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of the K2 extension.

By January 2015, Kepler and its follow-up observations had found 1,013 confirmed exoplanets in about 440 star systems, along with a further 3,199 unconfirmed planet candidates. Four planets have been confirmed through Kepler&#x27;s K2 mission. In November 2013, astronomers estimated, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion rocky Earth-size exoplanets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way. It is estimated that 11 billion of these planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars. The nearest such planet may be away, according to the scientists.

On January 6, 2015, NASA announced the 1,000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Four of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit within habitable zones of their related stars: three of the four, Kepler-438b, Kepler-442b and Kepler-452b, are almost Earth-size and likely rocky; the fourth, Kepler-440b, is a super-Earth. On May 10, 2016, NASA verified 1,284 new exoplanets found by Kepler, the single largest finding of planets to date.

Kepler data have also helped scientists observe and understand supernovae; measurements were collected every half-hour so the light curves were especially useful for studying these types of astronomical events.

On October 30, 2018, after the spacecraft ran out of fuel, NASA announced that the telescope would be retired. The telescope was shut down the same day, bringing an end to its nine-year service. Kepler observed 530,506 stars and discovered 2,662 exoplanets over its lifetime. A newer NASA mission, TESS, launched in 2018, is continuing the search for exoplanets.

==Spacecraft design==

The telescope has a mass of and contains a Schmidt camera with a front corrector plate (lens) feeding a primary mirror—at the time of its launch this was the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit, though the Herschel Space Observatory took this title a few months later. Its telescope has a 115 deg2 (about 12-degree diameter) field of view (FoV), roughly equivalent to the size of one&#x27;s fist held at arm&#x27;s length. Of this, 105 deg2 is of science quality, with less than 11% vignetting. The photometer has a soft focus to provide excellent photometry, rather than sharp images. The mission goal was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 ppm for a &quot;m&quot;(V)=12 Sun-like star for a 6.5-hour integration, though the observations fell short of this objective (see mission status).

===Camera===
The focal plane of the spacecraft&#x27;s camera is made out of forty-two CCDs at 2200×1024 pixels each, possessing a total resolution of 94.6 megapixels, which at the time made it the largest camera system launched into space. The array was cooled by heat pipes connected to an external radiator. The CCDs were read out every 6.5 seconds (to limit saturation) and co-added on board for 58.89 seconds for short cadence targets, and 1765.5 seconds (29.4 minutes) for long cadence targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kepler/K2 Data Products&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the larger bandwidth requirements for the former, these were limited in number to 512 compared to 170,000 for long cadence. However, even though at launch Kepler had the highest data rate of any NASA mission, the 29-minute sums of all 95 million pixels constituted more data than could be stored and sent back to Earth. Therefore, the science team pre-selected the relevant pixels associated with each star of interest, amounting to about 6 percent of the pixels (5.4 megapixels). The data from these pixels was then requantized, compressed and stored, along with other auxiliary data, in the on-board 16 gigabyte solid-state recorder. Data that was stored and downlinked includes science stars, p-mode stars, smear, black level, background and full field-of-view images.

===Primary mirror===
The Kepler primary mirror is in diameter. Manufactured by glass maker Corning using ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass, the mirror is specifically designed to have a mass only 14% that of a solid mirror of the same size. To produce a space telescope system with sufficient sensitivity to detect relatively small planets, as they pass in front of stars, a very high reflectance coating on the primary mirror was required. Using ion assisted evaporation, Surface Optics Corp. applied a protective nine-layer silver coating to enhance reflection and a dielectric interference coating to minimize the formation of color centers and atmospheric moisture absorption.

===Photometric performance===
In terms of photometric performance, Kepler worked well, much better than any Earth-bound telescope, but short of design goals. The objective was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 parts per million (PPM) on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. This estimate was developed allowing 10 ppm for stellar variability, roughly the value for the Sun. The obtained accuracy for this observation has a wide range, depending on the star and position on the focal plane, with a median of 29 ppm. Most of the additional noise appears to be due to a larger-than-expected variability in the stars themselves (19.5 ppm as opposed to the assumed 10.0 ppm), with the rest due to instrumental noise sources slightly larger than predicted.

Because decrease in brightness from an Earth-size planet transiting a Sun-like star is so small, only 80 ppm, the increased noise means each individual transit is only a 2.7 σ event, instead of the intended 4 σ. This, in turn, means more transits must be observed to be sure of a detection. Scientific estimates indicated that a mission lasting 7 to 8 years, as opposed to the originally planned 3.5 years, would be needed to find all transiting Earth-sized planets. On April 4, 2012, the Kepler mission was approved for extension through the fiscal year 2016, but this also depended on all remaining reaction wheels staying healthy, which turned out not to be the case (see Reaction wheel issues below).

===Orbit and orientation===
Kepler orbits the Sun, which avoids Earth occultations, stray light, and gravitational perturbations and torques inherent in an Earth orbit.

NASA has characterized Kepler&#x27;s orbit as &quot;Earth-trailing&quot;. With an orbital period of 372.5 days, Kepler is slowly falling farther behind Earth (about 16 million miles ). , the distance to Kepler from Earth was about . This means that after about 26 years Kepler will reach the other side of the Sun and will get back to the neighborhood of the Earth after 51 years.

Until 2013 the photometer pointed to a field in the northern constellations of Cygnus, Lyra and Draco, which is well out of the ecliptic plane, so that sunlight never enters the photometer as the spacecraft orbits. This is also the direction of the Solar System&#x27;s motion around the center of the galaxy. Thus, the stars which Kepler observed are roughly the same distance from the Galactic Center as the Solar System, and also close to the galactic plane. This fact is important if position in the galaxy is related to habitability, as suggested by the Rare Earth hypothesis.

Orientation is three-axis stabilized by sensing rotations using fine-guidance sensors located on the instrument focal plane (instead of rate sensing gyroscopes, e.g. as used on Hubble). and using reaction wheels and hydrazine thrusters to control the orientation.


===Operations===
Kepler was operated out of Boulder, Colorado, by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) under contract to Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies. The spacecraft&#x27;s solar array was rotated to face the Sun at the solstices and equinoxes, so as to optimize the amount of sunlight falling on the solar array and to keep the heat radiator pointing towards deep space. Together, LASP and Ball Aerospace controlled the spacecraft from a mission operations center located on the research campus of the University of Colorado. LASP performs essential mission planning and the initial collection and distribution of the science data. The mission&#x27;s initial life-cycle cost was estimated at US$600 million, including funding for 3.5 years of operation. In 2012, NASA announced that the Kepler mission would be funded until 2016 at a cost of about $20 million per year.

====Communications====
NASA contacted the spacecraft using the X band communication link twice a week for command and status updates. Scientific data are downloaded once a month using the Ka band link at a maximum data transfer rate of approximately 550 kB/s. The high gain antenna is not steerable so data collection is interrupted for a day to reorient the whole spacecraft and the high gain antenna for communications to Earth.

The Kepler space telescope conducted its own partial analysis on board and only transmitted scientific data deemed necessary to the mission in order to conserve bandwidth.

====Data management====
Science data telemetry collected during mission operations at LASP is sent for processing to the Kepler Data Management Center (DMC) which is located at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The science data telemetry is decoded and processed into uncalibrated FITS-format science data products by the DMC, which are then passed along to the Science Operations Center (SOC) at NASA Ames Research Center, for calibration and final processing. The SOC at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) develops and operates the tools needed to process scientific data for use by the &quot;Kepler&quot; Science Office (SO). Accordingly, the SOC develops the pipeline data processing software based on scientific algorithms developed jointly by the SO and SOC. During operations, the SOC:
#Receives uncalibrated pixel data from the DMC
#Applies the analysis algorithms to produce calibrated pixels and light curves for each star
#Performs transit searches for detection of planets (threshold-crossing events, or TCEs)
#Performs data validation of candidate planets by evaluating various data products for consistency as a way to eliminate false positive detections
The SOC also evaluates the photometric performance on an ongoing basis and provides the performance metrics to the SO and Mission Management Office. Finally, the SOC develops and maintains the project&#x27;s scientific databases, including catalogs and processed data. The SOC finally returns calibrated data products and scientific results back to the DMC for long-term archiving, and distribution to astronomers around the world through the Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST).

====Reaction wheel failures====
On July 14, 2012, one of the four reaction wheels used for fine pointing of the spacecraft failed. While Kepler requires only three reaction wheels to accurately aim the telescope, another failure would leave the spacecraft unable to aim at its original field.

After showing some problems in January 2013, a second reaction wheel failed on May 11, 2013, ending Kepler&#x27;s primary mission. The spacecraft was put into safe mode, then from June to August 2013 a series of engineering tests were done to try to recover either failed wheel. By August 15, 2013, it was decided that the wheels were unrecoverable, and an engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft&#x27;s remaining capabilities.

This effort ultimately led to the &quot;K2&quot; follow-on mission observing different fields near the ecliptic.

===Operational timeline===


In January 2006, the project&#x27;s launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA. It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems. At this time, the high-gain antenna was changed from a gimballed design to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month.

The Kepler observatory was launched on March 7, 2009, at 03:49:57 UTC aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The launch was a success and all three stages were completed by 04:55 UTC. The cover of the telescope was jettisoned on April 7, 2009, and the first light images were taken on the next day.

On April 20, 2009, it was announced that the Kepler science team had concluded that further refinement of the focus would dramatically increase the scientific return. On April 23, 2009, it was announced that the focus had been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror 40 micrometers (1.6 thousandths of an inch) towards the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 0.0072 degree.

On May 13, 2009, at 00:01 UTC, Kepler successfully completed its commissioning phase and began its search for planets around other stars.

On June 19, 2009, the spacecraft successfully sent its first science data to Earth. It was discovered that Kepler had entered safe mode on June 15. A second safe mode event occurred on July 2. In both cases the event was triggered by a &quot;processor reset&quot;. The spacecraft resumed normal operation on July 3 and the science data that had been collected since June 19 was downlinked that day. On October 14, 2009, the cause of these safing events was determined to be a low voltage power supply that provides power to the RAD750 processor. On January 12, 2010, one portion of the focal plane transmitted anomalous data, suggesting a problem with focal plane MOD-3 module, covering two out of Kepler&#x27;s 42 CCDs. , the module was described as &quot;failed&quot;, but the coverage still exceeded the science goals.

Kepler downlinked roughly twelve gigabytes of data about once per month.

==Field of view==

Kepler has a fixed field of view (FOV) against the sky. The diagram to the right shows the celestial coordinates and where the detector fields are located, along with the locations of a few bright stars with celestial north at the top left corner. The mission website has a calculator that will determine if a given object falls in the FOV, and if so, where it will appear in the photo detector output data stream. Data on exoplanet candidates is submitted to the Kepler Follow-up Program, or KFOP, to conduct follow-up observations.
Kepler&#x27;s field of view covers 115 square degrees, around 0.25 percent of the sky, or &quot;about two scoops of the Big Dipper&quot;. Thus, it would require around 400 Kepler-like telescopes to cover the whole sky. The Kepler field contains portions of the constellations Cygnus, Lyra, and Draco.

The nearest star system in Kepler&#x27;s field of view is the triple star system Gliese 1245, 15 light years from the Sun. The brown dwarf WISE J2000+3629, 22.8 ± 1 light years from the Sun is also in the field of view, but is invisible to Kepler due to emitting light primarily in infrared wavelengths.

==Objectives and methods==

The scientific objective of the Kepler space telescope was to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems. This spacecraft observes a large sample of stars to achieve several key goals:

* To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets there are in or near the habitable zone (often called &quot;Goldilocks planets&quot;) of a wide variety of spectral types of stars.
* To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these planets.
* To estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems.
* To determine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and density of short-period giant planets.
* To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques.
* Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems.

Most of the exoplanets previously detected by other projects were giant planets, mostly the size of Jupiter and bigger. Kepler was designed to look for planets 30 to 600 times less massive, closer to the order of Earth&#x27;s mass (Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth). The method used, the transit method, involves observing repeated transit of planets in front of their stars, which causes a slight reduction in the star&#x27;s apparent magnitude, on the order of 0.01% for an Earth-size planet. The degree of this reduction in brightness can be used to deduce the diameter of the planet, and the interval between transits can be used to deduce the planet&#x27;s orbital period, from which estimates of its orbital semi-major axis (using Kepler&#x27;s laws) and its temperature (using models of stellar radiation) can be calculated.

The probability of a random planetary orbit being along the line-of-sight to a star is the diameter of the star divided by the diameter of the orbit. For an Earth-size planet at 1 AU transiting a Sun-like star the probability is 0.47%, or about 1 in 210. For a planet like Venus orbiting a Sun-like star the probability is slightly higher, at 0.65%; If the host star has multiple planets, the probability of additional detections is higher than the probability of initial detection assuming planets in a given system tend to orbit in similar planes—an assumption consistent with current models of planetary system formation. For instance, if a &quot;Kepler&quot;-like mission conducted by aliens observed Earth transiting the Sun, there is a 7% chance that it would also see Venus transiting.

Kepler&#x27;s 115 deg2 field of view gives it a much higher probability of detecting Earth-sized planets than the Hubble Space Telescope, which has a field of view of only 10 sq. arc-minutes. Moreover, Kepler is dedicated to detecting planetary transits, while the Hubble Space Telescope is used to address a wide range of scientific questions, and rarely looks continuously at just one starfield. Of the approximately half-million stars in Kepler&#x27;s field of view, around 150,000 stars were selected for observation. More than 90,000 are G-type stars on, or near, the main sequence. Thus, Kepler was designed to be sensitive to wavelengths of 400–865 nm where brightness of those stars peaks. Most of the stars observed by Kepler have apparent visual magnitude between 14 and 16 but the brightest observed stars have apparent visual magnitude of 8 or lower. Most of the planet candidates were initially not expected to be confirmed due to being too faint for follow-up observations. All the selected stars are observed simultaneously, with the spacecraft measuring variations in their brightness every thirty minutes. This provides a better chance for seeing a transit. The mission was designed to maximize the probability of detecting planets orbiting other stars.

Because Kepler must observe at least three transits to confirm that the dimming of a star was caused by a transiting planet, and because larger planets give a signal that is easier to check, scientists expected the first reported results to be larger Jupiter-size planets in tight orbits. The first of these were reported after only a few months of operation. Smaller planets, and planets farther from their sun would take longer, and discovering planets comparable to Earth were expected to take three years or longer.

Data collected by Kepler is also being used for studying variable stars of various types and performing asteroseismology, particularly on stars showing solar-like oscillations.

==Planet finding process==

===Finding planet candidates===
Once Kepler has collected and sent back the data, raw light curves are constructed. Brightness values are then adjusted to take the brightness variations due to the rotation of the spacecraft into account. The next step is processing (folding) light curves into a more easily observable form and letting software select signals that seem potentially transit-like. At this point, any signal that shows potential transit-like features is called a threshold crossing event. These signals are individually inspected in two inspection rounds, with the first round taking only a few seconds per target. This inspection eliminates erroneously selected non-signals, signals caused by instrumental noise and obvious eclipsing binaries.

Threshold crossing events that pass these tests are called Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI), receive a KOI designation and are archived. KOIs are inspected more thoroughly in a process called dispositioning. Those which pass the dispositioning are called Kepler planet candidates. The KOI archive is not static, meaning that a Kepler candidate could end up in the false-positive list upon further inspection. In turn, KOIs that were mistakenly classified as false positives could end up back in the candidates list.

Not all the planet candidates go through this process. Circumbinary planets do not show strictly periodic transits, and have to be inspected through other methods. In addition, third-party researchers use different data-processing methods, or even search planet candidates from the unprocessed light curve data. As a consequence, those planets may be missing KOI designation.

===Confirming planet candidates===

Once suitable candidates have been found from Kepler data, it is necessary to rule out false positives with follow-up tests.

Usually, Kepler candidates are imaged individually with more-advanced ground-based telescopes in order to resolve any background objects which could contaminate the brightness signature of the transit signal. Another method to rule out planet candidates is astrometry for which Kepler can collect good data even though doing so was not a design goal. While Kepler cannot detect planetary-mass objects with this method, it can be used to determine if the transit was caused by a stellar-mass object.

====Through other detection methods====

There are a few different exoplanet detection methods which help to rule out false positives by giving further proof that a candidate is a real planet. One of the methods, called doppler spectroscopy, requires follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes. This method works well if the planet is massive or is located around a relatively bright star. While current spectrographs are insufficient for confirming planetary candidates with small masses around relatively dim stars, this method can be used to discover additional massive non-transiting planet candidates around targeted stars.

In multiplanetary systems, planets can often be confirmed through transit timing variation by looking at the time between successive transits, which may vary if planets are gravitationally perturbed by each other. This helps to confirm relatively low-mass planets even when the star is relatively distant. Transit timing variations indicate that two or more planets belong to the same planetary system. There are even cases where a non-transiting planet is also discovered in this way.

Circumbinary planets show much larger transit timing variations between transits than planets gravitationally disturbed by other planets. Their transit duration times also vary significantly. Transit timing and duration variations for circumbinary planets are caused by the orbital motion of the host stars, rather than by other planets. In addition, if the planet is massive enough, it can cause slight variations of the host stars&#x27; orbital periods. Despite being harder to find circumbinary planets due to their non-periodic transits, it is much easier to confirm them, as timing patterns of transits cannot be mimicked by an eclipsing binary or a background star system.

In addition to transits, planets orbiting around their stars undergo reflected-light variations—like the Moon, they go through phases from full to new and back again. Because Kepler cannot resolve the planet from the star, it sees only the combined light, and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small—the photometric precision required to see a close-in giant planet is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star—Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days or less are detectable by sensitive space telescopes such as Kepler. In the long run, this method may help find more planets than the transit method, because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of the planet&#x27;s orbital inclination, and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. In addition, the phase function of a giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planetary properties, such as the particle size distribution of the atmospheric particles.

Kepler&#x27;s photometric precision is often high enough to observe a star&#x27;s brightness changes caused by doppler beaming or a star&#x27;s shape deformation by a companion. These can sometimes be used to rule out hot Jupiter candidates as false positives caused by a star or a brown dwarf when these effects are too noticeable. However, there are some cases where such effects are detected even by planetary-mass companions such as TrES-2b.

====Through validation====

If a planet cannot be detected through at least one of the other detection methods, it can be confirmed by determining if the possibility of a Kepler candidate being a real planet is significantly larger than any false-positive scenarios combined. One of the first methods was to see if other telescopes can see the transit as well. The first planet confirmed through this method was Kepler-22b which was also observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope in addition to analyzing any other false-positive possibilities. Such confirmation is costly, as small planets can generally be detected only with space telescopes.

In 2014, a new confirmation method called &quot;validation by multiplicity&quot; was announced. From the planets previously confirmed through various methods, it was found that planets in most planetary systems orbit in a relatively flat plane, similar to the planets found in the Solar System. This means that if a star has multiple planet candidates, it is very likely a real planetary system. Transit signals still need to meet several criteria which rule out false-positive scenarios. For instance, it has to have considerable signal-to-noise ratio, it has at least three observed transits, orbital stability of those systems have to be stable and transit curve has to have a shape that partly eclipsing binaries could not mimic the transit signal. In addition, its orbital period needs to be 1.6 days or longer to rule out common false positives caused by eclipsing binaries. Validation by multiplicity method is very efficient and allows to confirm hundreds of Kepler candidates in a relatively short amount of time.

A new validation method using a tool called PASTIS has been developed. It makes it possible to confirm a planet even when only a single candidate transit event for the host star has been detected. A drawback of this tool is that it requires a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio from &quot;Kepler&quot; data, so it can mainly confirm only larger planets or planets around quiet and relatively bright stars. Currently, the analysis of Kepler candidates through this method is underway. PASTIS was first successful for validating the planet Kepler-420b.

==K2 Extension==
In April 2012, an independent panel of senior NASA scientists recommended that the Kepler mission be continued through 2016. According to the senior review, Kepler observations needed to continue until at least 2015 to achieve all the stated scientific goals. On November 14, 2012, NASA announced the completion of Kepler&#x27;s primary mission, and the beginning of its extended mission, which ended in 2018 when it ran out of fuel.

===Reaction wheel issues===
In July 2012, one of Kepler&#x27;s four reaction wheels (wheel 2) failed. On May 11, 2013, a second wheel (wheel 4) failed, jeopardizing the continuation of the mission, as three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting. Kepler had not collected science data since May because it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy. On July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively; wheel 4 only rotated counter-clockwise but wheel 2 ran in both directions, albeit with significantly elevated friction levels. A further test of wheel 4 on July 25 managed to achieve bi-directional rotation. Both wheels, however, exhibited too much friction to be useful. On August 2, NASA put out a call for proposals to use the remaining capabilities of Kepler for other scientific missions. Starting on August 8, a full systems evaluation was conducted. It was determined that wheel 2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions and the spacecraft was returned to a &quot;rest&quot; state to conserve fuel. Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in previous tests. Sending astronauts to fix Kepler is not an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers from Earth.

On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that Kepler would not continue searching for planets using the transit method after attempts to resolve issues with two of the four reaction wheels failed. An engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft&#x27;s capabilities, its two good reaction wheels and its thrusters. Concurrently, a scientific study was conducted to determine whether enough knowledge can be obtained from Kepler&#x27;s limited scope to justify its $18 million per year cost.

Possible ideas included searching for asteroids and comets, looking for evidence of supernovas, and finding huge exoplanets through gravitational microlensing. Another proposal was to modify the software on Kepler to compensate for the disabled reaction wheels. Instead of the stars being fixed and stable in Kepler&#x27;s field of view, they will drift. Proposed software was to track this drift and more or less completely recover the mission goals despite being unable to hold the stars in a fixed view.

Previously collected data continued to be analyzed.

=== Second Light (K2)===
In November 2013, a new mission plan named K2 &quot;Second Light&quot; was presented for consideration. K2 would involve using Kepler&#x27;s remaining capability, photometric precision of about 300 parts per million, compared with about 20 parts per million earlier, to collect data for the study of &quot;supernova explosions, star formation and Solar-System bodies such as asteroids and comets, ... &quot; and for finding and studying more exoplanets. In this proposed mission plan, Kepler would search a much larger area in the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. Celestial objects, including exoplanets, stars and others, detected by the K2 mission would be associated with the EPIC acronym, standing for Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog.
In early 2014, the spacecraft underwent successful testing for the K2 mission. From March to May 2014, data from a new field called Field 0 was collected as a testing run. On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of extending the Kepler mission to the K2 mission. Kepler&#x27;s photometric precision for the K2 mission was estimated to be 50 ppm on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. In February 2014, photometric precision for the K2 mission using two-wheel, fine-point precision operations was measured as 44 ppm on magnitude 12 stars for a 6.5-hour integration. The analysis of these measurements by NASA suggests the K2 photometric precision approaches that of the Kepler archive of three-wheel, fine-point precision data.

On May 29, 2014, campaign fields 0 to 13 were reported and described in detail.

Field 1 of the K2 mission is set towards the Leo-Virgo region of the sky, while Field 2 is towards the &quot;head&quot; area of Scorpius and includes two globular clusters, Messier 4 and Messier 80, and part of the Scorpius–Centaurus association, which is only about 11 million years old and distant with probably over 1,000 members.

On December 18, 2014, NASA announced that the K2 mission had detected its first confirmed exoplanet, a super-Earth named HIP 116454 b. Its signature was found in a set of engineering data meant to prepare the spacecraft for the full &quot;K2&quot; mission. Radial velocity follow-up observations were needed as only a single transit of the planet was detected.

During a scheduled contact on April 7, 2016, Kepler was found to be operating in emergency mode, the lowest operational and most fuel intensive mode. Mission operations declared a spacecraft emergency, which afforded them priority access to NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Network. By the evening of April 8 the spacecraft had been upgraded to safe mode, and on April 10 it was placed into point-rest state, a stable mode which provides normal communication and the lowest fuel burn. At that time, the cause of the emergency was unknown, but it was not believed that Kepler&#x27;s reaction wheels or a planned maneuver to support &quot;K2&quot; Campaign 9 were responsible. Operators downloaded and analyzed engineering data from the spacecraft, with the prioritization of returning to normal science operations. Kepler was returned to science mode on April 22. The emergency caused the first half of Campaign 9 to be shortened by two weeks.

In June 2016, NASA announced a K2 mission extension of three additional years, beyond the expected exhaustion of on-board fuel in 2018. In August 2018, NASA roused the spacecraft from sleep mode, applied a modified configuration to deal with thruster problems that degraded pointing performance, and began collecting scientific data for the 19th observation campaign, finding that the onboard fuel was not yet utterly exhausted.

On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the spacecraft was out of fuel and its mission was officially ended.

==Mission results==

The Kepler space telescope was in active operation from 2009 through 2013, with the first main results announced on January 4, 2010. As expected, the initial discoveries were all short-period planets. As the mission continued, additional longer-period candidates were found. , Kepler has discovered 5,011 exoplanet candidates and 2,662 confirmed exoplanets.
 As of August 2022, 2,056 exoplanet candidates remain to be confirmed and 2,711 are now confirmed exoplanets.

===2009===
NASA held a press conference to discuss early science results of the Kepler mission on August 6, 2009. At this press conference, it was revealed that Kepler had confirmed the existence of the previously known transiting exoplanet HAT-P-7b, and was functioning well enough to discover Earth-size planets.

Because Kepler&#x27;s detection of planets depends on seeing very small changes in brightness, stars that vary in brightness by themselves (variable stars) are not useful in this search. From the first few months of data, Kepler scientists determined that about 7,500 stars from the initial target list are such variable stars. These were dropped from the target list, and replaced by new candidates. On November 4, 2009, the Kepler project publicly released the light curves of the dropped stars. The first new planet candidate observed by Kepler was originally marked as a false positive because of uncertainties in the mass of its parent star. However, it was confirmed ten years later and is now designated Kepler-1658b.

The first six weeks of data revealed five previously unknown planets, all very close to their stars. Among the notable results are one of the least dense planets yet found, two low-mass white dwarfs that were initially reported as being members of a new class of stellar objects, and Kepler-16b, a well-characterized planet orbiting a binary star.

===2010===
On June 15, 2010, the Kepler mission released data on all but 400 of the ~156,000 planetary target stars to the public. 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates, with sizes ranging from as small as Earth to larger than Jupiter. The identity and characteristics of 306 of the 706 targets were given. The released targets included five candidate multi-planet systems, including six extra exoplanet candidates. Only 33.5 days of data were available for most of the candidates. NASA also announced data for another 400 candidates were being withheld to allow members of the &quot;Kepler&quot; team to perform follow-up observations. The data for these candidates was published February 2, 2011. (See the &quot;Kepler&quot; results for 2011 below.)

The Kepler results, based on the candidates in the list released in 2010, implied that most candidate planets have radii less than half that of Jupiter. The results also imply that small candidate planets with periods less than thirty days are much more common than large candidate planets with periods less than thirty days and that the ground-based discoveries are sampling the large-size tail of the size distribution. This contradicted older theories which had suggested small and Earth-size planets would be relatively infrequent. Based on extrapolations from the &quot;Kepler&quot; data, an estimate of around 100 million habitable planets in the Milky Way may be realistic. Some media reports of the TED talk have led to the misunderstanding that &quot;Kepler&quot; had actually found these planets. This was clarified in a letter to the Director of the NASA Ames Research Center, for the Kepler Science Council dated August 2, 2010 states, &quot;Analysis of the current Kepler data does not support the assertion that Kepler has found any Earth-like planets.&quot;

In 2010, Kepler identified two systems containing objects which are smaller and hotter than their parent stars: KOI 74 and KOI 81. These objects are probably low-mass white dwarfs produced by previous episodes of mass transfer in their systems.

===2011===
On February 2, 2011, the Kepler team announced the results of analysis of the data taken between 2 May and September 16, 2009. They found 1235 planetary candidates circling 997 host stars. (The numbers that follow assume the candidates are really planets, though the official papers called them only candidates. Independent analysis indicated that at least 90% of them are real planets and not false positives). 68 planets were approximately Earth-size, 288 super-Earth-size, 662 Neptune-size, 165 Jupiter-size, and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter. In contrast to previous work, roughly 74% of the planets are smaller than Neptune, most likely as a result of previous work finding large planets more easily than smaller ones.

That February 2, 2011 release of 1235 exoplanet candidates included 54 that may be in the &quot;habitable zone&quot;, including five less than twice the size of Earth. There were previously only two planets thought to be in the &quot;habitable zone&quot;, so these new findings represent an enormous expansion of the potential number of &quot;Goldilocks planets&quot; (planets of the right temperature to support liquid water). All of the habitable zone candidates found thus far orbit stars significantly smaller and cooler than the Sun (habitable candidates around Sun-like stars will take several additional years to accumulate the three transits required for detection). Of all the new planet candidates, 68 are 125% of Earth&#x27;s size or smaller, or smaller than all previously discovered exoplanets. &quot;Earth-size&quot; and &quot;super-Earth-size&quot; is defined as &quot;less than or equal to 2 Earth radii (Re)&quot; [(or, Rp ≤ 2.0 Re) – Table 5]. Six such planet candidates [namely: KOI 326.01 (Rp=0.85), KOI 701.03 (Rp=1.73), KOI 268.01 (Rp=1.75), KOI 1026.01 (Rp=1.77), KOI 854.01 (Rp=1.91), KOI 70.03 (Rp=1.96) – Table 6] are in the &quot;habitable zone.&quot; A more recent study found that one of these candidates (KOI 326.01) is in fact much larger and hotter than first reported.

The frequency of planet observations was highest for exoplanets two to three times Earth-size, and then declined in inverse proportionality to the area of the planet. The best estimate (as of March 2011), after accounting for observational biases, was: 5.4% of stars host Earth-size candidates, 6.8% host super-Earth-size candidates, 19.3% host Neptune-size candidates, and 2.55% host Jupiter-size or larger candidates. Multi-planet systems are common; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the planets are in multiple planet systems.

By December 5, 2011, the Kepler team announced that they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures, the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure; this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data.

On December 20, 2011, the Kepler team announced the discovery of the first Earth-size exoplanets, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20.

Based on Kepler&#x27;s findings, astronomer Seth Shostak estimated in 2011 that &quot;within a thousand light-years of Earth&quot;, there are &quot;at least 30,000&quot; habitable planets. Also based on the findings, the Kepler team has estimated that there are &quot;at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way&quot;, of which &quot;at least 500 million&quot; are in the habitable zone. In March 2011, astronomers at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reported that about &quot;1.4 to 2.7 percent&quot; of all Sun-like stars are expected to have Earth-size planets &quot;within the habitable zones of their stars&quot;. This means there are &quot;two billion&quot; of these &quot;Earth analogs&quot; in the Milky Way alone. The JPL astronomers also noted that there are &quot;50 billion other galaxies&quot;, potentially yielding more than one sextillion &quot;Earth analog&quot; planets if all galaxies have similar numbers of planets to the Milky Way.

===2012===
In January 2012, an international team of astronomers reported that each star in the Milky Way may host &quot;on average...at least 1.6 planets&quot;, suggesting that over 160 billion star-bound planets may exist in the Milky Way. Kepler also recorded distant stellar super-flares, some of which are 10,000 times more powerful than the 1859 Carrington event. The superflares may be triggered by close-orbiting Jupiter-sized planets. The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) technique, which was used to discover Kepler-9d, gained popularity for confirming exoplanet discoveries. A planet in a system with four stars was also confirmed, the first time such a system had been discovered.

, there were a total of 2,321 candidates. Of these, 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars. The Kepler team estimated that 5.4% of all stars host Earth-size planet candidates, and that 17% of all stars have multiple planets.

===2013===
According to a study by Caltech astronomers published in January 2013, the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets. The study, based on planets orbiting the star Kepler-32, suggests that planetary systems may be common around stars in the Milky Way. The discovery of 461 more candidates was announced on January 7, 2013. The longer Kepler watches, the more planets with long periods it can detect.

A candidate, newly announced on January 7, 2013, was Kepler-69c (formerly, &quot;KOI-172.02&quot;), an Earth-size exoplanet orbiting a star similar to the Sun in the habitable zone and possibly habitable.

In April 2013, a white dwarf was discovered bending the light of its companion red dwarf in the KOI-256 star system.

In April 2013, NASA announced the discovery of three new Earth-size exoplanets—Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f, and Kepler-69c—in the habitable zones of their respective host stars, Kepler-62 and Kepler-69. The new exoplanets are considered prime candidates for possessing liquid water and thus a habitable environment. A more recent analysis has shown that Kepler-69c is likely more analogous to Venus, and thus unlikely to be habitable.

On May 15, 2013, NASA announced the space telescope had been crippled by failure of a reaction wheel that keeps it pointed in the right direction. A second wheel had previously failed, and the telescope required three wheels (out of four total) to be operational for the instrument to function properly. Further testing in July and August determined that while Kepler was capable of using its damaged reaction wheels to prevent itself from entering safe mode and of downlinking previously collected science data it was not capable of collecting further science data as previously configured. Scientists working on the Kepler project said there was a of data still to be looked at, and that more discoveries would be made in the following couple of years, despite the setback.

Although no new science data from Kepler field had been collected since the problem, an additional sixty-three candidates were announced in July 2013 based on the previously collected observations.

In November 2013, the second Kepler science conference was held. The discoveries included the median size of planet candidates getting smaller compared to early 2013, preliminary results of the discovery of a few circumbinary planets and planets in the habitable zone.

===2014===
On February 13, over 530 additional planet candidates were announced residing around single planet systems. Several of them were nearly Earth-sized and located in the habitable zone. This number was further increased by about 400 in June 2014.

On February 26, scientists announced that data from Kepler had confirmed the existence of 715 new exoplanets. A new statistical method of confirmation was used called &quot;verification by multiplicity&quot; which is based on how many planets around multiple stars were found to be real planets. This allowed much quicker confirmation of numerous candidates which are part of multiplanetary systems. 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.

In March, a study found that small planets with orbital periods of less than one day are usually accompanied by at least one additional planet with orbital period of 1–50 days. This study also noted that ultra-short period planets are almost always smaller than 2 Earth radii unless it is a misaligned hot Jupiter.

On April 17, the Kepler team announced the discovery of Kepler-186f, the first nearly Earth-sized planet located in the habitable zone. This planet orbits around a red dwarf.

In May 2014, K2 observations fields 0 to 13 were announced and described in detail. K2 observations began in June 2014.

In July 2014, the first discoveries from K2 field data were reported in the form of eclipsing binaries. Discoveries were derived from a Kepler engineering data set which was collected prior to campaign 0 in preparation to the main &quot;K2&quot; mission.

On September 23, 2014, NASA reported that the &quot;K2&quot; mission had completed campaign 1, the first official set of science observations, and that campaign 2 was underway.

Campaign 3 lasted from November 14, 2014, to February 6, 2015, and included &quot;16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets&quot;.

===2015===

* In January 2015, the number of confirmed Kepler planets exceeded 1000. At least two (Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b) of the discovered planets announced that month were likely rocky and in the habitable zone. Also in January 2015, NASA reported that five confirmed sub-earth-sized rocky exoplanets, all smaller than the planet Venus, were found orbiting the 11.2 billion year old star Kepler-444, making this star system, at 80% of the age of the universe, the oldest yet discovered.
* In April 2015, campaign 4 was reported to last between February 7, 2015, and April 24, 2015, and to include observations of nearly 16,000 target stars and two notable open star clusters, Pleiades and Hyades.
* In May 2015, Kepler observed a newly discovered supernova, KSN 2011b (Type 1a), before, during and after explosion. Details of the pre-nova moments may help scientists better understand dark energy.
* On July 24, 2015, NASA announced the discovery of Kepler-452b, a confirmed exoplanet that is near-Earth in size and found orbiting the habitable zone of a Sun-like star. The seventh Kepler planet candidate catalog was released, containing 4,696 candidates, and increase of 521 candidates since the previous catalog release in January 2015.
* On September 14, 2015, astronomers reported unusual light fluctuations of KIC 8462852, an F-type main-sequence star in the constellation Cygnus, as detected by Kepler, while searching for exoplanets. Various hypotheses have been presented, including comets, asteroids, and an alien civilization.

===2016===
By May 10, 2016, the Kepler mission had verified 1,284 new planets. Based on their size, about 550 could be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars&#x27; habitable zone: Kepler-560b, Kepler-705b, Kepler-1229b, Kepler-1410b, Kepler-1455b, Kepler-1544 b, Kepler-1593b, Kepler-1606b, and Kepler-1638b.

===Data releases===
The Kepler team originally promised to release data within one year of observations. However, this plan was changed after launch, with data being scheduled for release up to three years after its collection. This resulted in considerable criticism, leading the Kepler science team to release the third quarter of their data one year and nine months after collection. The data through September 2010 (quarters 4, 5, and 6) was made public in January 2012.

===Follow-ups by others===
Periodically, the Kepler team releases a list of candidates (Kepler Objects of Interest, or KOIs) to the public. Using this information, a team of astronomers collected radial velocity data using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to confirm the existence of the candidate KOI-428b in 2010, later named Kepler-40b. In 2011, the same team confirmed candidate KOI-423b, later named Kepler-39b.

===Citizen scientist participation===
Since December 2010, Kepler mission data has been used for the Planet Hunters project, which allows volunteers to look for transit events in the light curves of Kepler images to identify planets that computer algorithms might miss. By June 2011, users had found sixty-nine potential candidates that were previously unrecognized by the Kepler mission team. The team has plans to publicly credit amateurs who spot such planets.

In January 2012, the BBC program &quot;Stargazing Live&quot; aired a public appeal for volunteers to analyse Planethunters.org data for potential new exoplanets. This led two amateur astronomers—one in Peterborough, England—to discover a new Neptune-sized exoplanet, to be named Threapleton Holmes B. One hundred thousand other volunteers were also engaged in the search by late January, analyzing over one million Kepler images by early 2012. One such exoplanet, PH1b (or Kepler-64b from its Kepler designation), was discovered in 2012. A second exoplanet, PH2b (Kepler-86b) was discovered in 2013.

In April 2017, ABC &quot;Stargazing Live&quot;, a variation of BBC &quot;Stargazing Live&quot;, launched the Zooniverse project &quot;Exoplanet Explorers&quot;. While Planethunters.org worked with archived data, Exoplanet Explorers used recently downlinked data from the K2 mission. On the first day of the project, 184 transit candidates were identified that passed simple tests. On the second day, the research team identified a star system, later named K2-138, with a Sun-like star and four super-Earths in a tight orbit. In the end, volunteers helped to identify 90 exoplanet candidates. The citizen scientists that helped discover the new star system will be added as co-authors in the research paper when published.

===Confirmed exoplanets===

Exoplanets discovered using &quot;Kepler&quot; data, but confirmed by outside researchers, include Kepler-39b, Kepler-40b, Kepler-41b, Kepler-43b, Kepler-44b, Kepler-45b, as well as the planets orbiting Kepler-223 and Kepler-42. The &quot;KOI&quot; acronym indicates that the star is a &quot;K&quot;epler &quot;O&quot;bject of &quot;I&quot;nterest.

==Kepler Input Catalog==
The Kepler Input Catalog is a publicly searchable database of roughly 13.2 million targets used for the Kepler Spectral Classification Program and the Kepler mission. The catalog alone is not used for finding Kepler targets, because only a portion of the listed stars (about one-third of the catalog) can be observed by the spacecraft.

==Solar System observations==
Kepler has been assigned an observatory code in order to report its astrometric observations of small Solar System bodies to the Minor Planet Center. In 2013 the alternative &quot;NEOKepler&quot; mission was proposed, a search for near-Earth objects, in particular potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). Its unique orbit and larger field of view than existing survey telescopes allow it to look for objects inside Earth&#x27;s orbit. It was predicted a 12-month survey could make a significant contribution to the hunt for PHAs as well as potentially locating targets for NASA&#x27;s Asteroid Redirect Mission. Kepler&#x27;s first discovery in the Solar System, however, was , a 200-kilometer cold classical Kuiper belt object located beyond the orbit of Neptune.

==Retirement==

On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the Kepler space telescope, having run out of fuel, and after nine years of service and the discovery of over 2,600 exoplanets, has been officially retired, and will maintain its current, safe orbit, away from Earth. The spacecraft was deactivated with a &quot;goodnight&quot; command sent from the mission&#x27;s control center at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics on November 15, 2018. Kepler&#x27;s retirement coincides with the 388th anniversary of Johannes Kepler&#x27;s death in 1630.

<text>Kevin O&#x27;Donovan McClory (8 June 1924 – 20 November 2006) was an Irish screenwriter, film producer, and film director. McClory was best known for producing the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot; and for his legal battles with the character&#x27;s creator, Ian Fleming (later United Artists, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Eon Productions).

==Early years==
McClory was born in Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin, in 1924, to noted actor Thomas John O&#x27;Donovan McClory (stage name Desmond O&#x27;Donovan) and Winifrede (née Doran), a writer, teacher and actress. He suffered from dyslexia. McClory&#x27;s ancestry goes back to the famous Brontë family. Elinor McClory was the mother of Patrick Prunty who changed his name to Bronte when he emigrated from Ireland to England in 1802. Patrick was the father of Emily, Anne, Charlotte, and Branwell Brontë. McClory&#x27;s parents were actors and theatre producers in Ireland.

==Second World War==
As a teenaged radio officer in the British Merchant Navy, McClory endured attacks by German U-boats on two different occasions. The first attack occurred on 20 September 1942 while he was serving aboard &quot;The Mathilda&quot;. A U-Boat surfaced and attacked the ship with heavy machine gun fire. The crew of the ship fired back, and the U-Boat retreated. The second attack occurred on 21 February 1943 when McClory was serving on the Norwegian tanker &quot;Stigstad&quot;, which was attacked by multiple U-boats when it was a part of Convoy ON 166. The ship sank, and McClory and the other survivors made it to a life raft. They survived in terrible conditions for two weeks and travelled more than 600 miles before being rescued off the coast of Ireland. Two seaman died on the raft, and a third died soon after they were rescued. McClory suffered severe frostbite and lost the ability to speak for more than a year after the incident. When he recovered his voice, he was left with a pronounced stammer. He served out the rest of the war in Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy.

==1950s==

McClory started a career at Shepperton Studios in Middlesex as a film boom operator and location manager, where he worked on &quot;The Cockleshell Heroes&quot; for Warwick Films. He was an assistant to John Huston on films including &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951) and &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952). He was an assistant director on Huston&#x27;s version of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1956), and associate producer and second-unit director on Mike Todd&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (also 1956).

McClory was romantically involved with Elizabeth Taylor. Although he and Taylor reportedly had plans to marry, she eventually left him for her future husband Mike Todd. Todd and McClory fell out over Taylor, yet they managed to complete the final cut of the film side by side. The trio would eventually reconcile, and they remained friends until Todd&#x27;s untimely death in 1958.

In 1957, McClory led an expedition of 25 men in an attempt to drive around the world. He filmed a documentary of the adventure, &quot;One Road&quot;, as well as a series of ads for his sponsor Ford Motor Company. The team completed the journey in 104 days. He later wrote, produced and directed the 1957 film &quot;The Boy and the Bridge&quot;, with financial assistance from heiress Josephine Hartford Bryce (sister of Huntington Hartford) and her husband Ivor Bryce, a friend of Ian Fleming.

==1960s==

In 1958 Fleming approached McClory to produce the first Bond film. McClory rejected all of Fleming&#x27;s books but felt that the character James Bond could be adapted for the screen. McClory, Bryce, Fleming and Jack Whittingham developed the character through a number of treatments and screenplays. McClory, Fleming and Bryce settled on a screenplay, &quot;Longitude 78 West&quot; (later renamed &quot;Thunderball&quot;), and went into pre-production. Fleming novelised the draft screenplay as his ninth novel,&quot;Thunderball&quot;, in 1961 and initially did not credit McClory or Whittingham. McClory and Whittingham engaged libel lawyer Peter Carter-Ruck and sued Fleming shortly after the 1961 publication of the &quot;Thunderball&quot; novel, claiming he based it upon the screenplay the trio had earlier written.

The trial opened in the High Court in London on 20 November 1963. After nine days, the case was settled out of court. Fleming paid McClory damages of £35,000 and McClory&#x27;s court costs of £52,000, and future versions of the novel were credited as &quot;based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming&quot; – in that order. Fleming conveyed to McClory the worldwide film rights to the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot; and McClory retained certain screen rights to the novel&#x27;s story, plot, and characters. Harry Saltzman&#x27;s and Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s production company Eon Productions later made a deal with McClory for &quot;Thunderball&quot; to be made into a film in 1965, with McClory producing. Under the deal, Eon licensed McClory&#x27;s rights for a period of ten years and in return they assigned to McClory any rights they had in the scripts and treatments. McClory made an uncredited cameo in the film. By then, Bond was a box-office success, and series producers Broccoli and Saltzman feared a rival McClory film beyond their control; they agreed to McClory&#x27;s producer&#x27;s credit of a cinematic &quot;Thunderball&quot;, with them as executive producers.

In 1968 McClory announced plans to make a film about Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins, to star Richard Harris. The film was to have been shot at Ardmore Studios in 1969 but was never made.

==1970s–1980s==
In 1975, McClory and Richard Harris took out a full-page ad in &quot;The Nassau Tribune&quot; &quot;demanding an end to internment without trial&quot; in Northern Ireland. Conservative opposition leader Edward Heath who was visiting Nassau at the time called a press conference and advised &quot;Harris and McClory to &#x27;ask their friends to stop murdering people.&#x27;&quot;

In 1976, McClory announced he was to produce a second adaptation of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, to be titled either &quot;Warhead&quot;, &quot;Warhead 8&quot;, or &quot;James Bond of the Secret Service&quot;. The script ran into difficulties, after accusations from Danjaq and United Artists that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based only on the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;; once again, the project was delayed. The project returned to the original nuclear terrorism plot of the original &quot;Thunderball&quot;, in order to avoid another lawsuit from Danjaq, and after McClory saw Jimmy Carter mention the issue in a 1980 presidential debate with Ronald Reagan. A final attempt by Fleming&#x27;s trustees to block the film was made in the High Court in London in the spring of 1983, but this was thrown out by the court and the film, now titled &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, was permitted to proceed. Lord Justices Waller, Fox and May affirmed McClory&#x27;s right to make James Bond films and enjoined the plaintiffs from taking similar legal action against McClory in the future. McClory went on to license his rights to Jack Schwartzman.

In 1988, he attempted an animated TV cartoon in partnership with a Dutch company, &quot;James Bond vs. S.P.E.C.T.R.E.&quot;, but this never came to fruition, and &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot; was created as EON&#x27;s counterattack to the aborted McClory animated attempt.

In 1989, McClory attempted to recycle the &quot;Warhead&quot; script again, retitling the project &quot;Atomic Warfare&quot;. He approached Pierce Brosnan who had missed out on the role of James Bond to Timothy Dalton due to his contract with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Remington Steele&quot;. The film was supposed to be mainly set in Australia.

==1990s–2000s==
McClory subsequently continued attempts to make other adaptations of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, including &quot;Warhead 2000 A.D.&quot; which was to be made by Sony. MGM/UA took legal action against Sony and McClory in the United States to prevent the film going into production. MGM/UA abandoned the claim after settling with Sony. His rights were untouched. In 2004, Sony acquired 20% of MGM; however, the production and authority over everything involving the film version of James Bond is controlled by Eon Productions (Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s production company) and its parent company Danjaq, LLC. In 1992, McClory had to license the rights to producer Albert S. Ruddy for a proposed &quot;James Bond&quot; television program, but EON Productions blocked it, ending any hopes of a Bond TV show.

Prior to the settlement with MGM in 1999, Sony filed a lawsuit against MGM claiming McClory was the co-author of the cinematic 007 and was owed fees from Danjaq and MGM for all past films. This lawsuit was dismissed in 2000 on the ground that McClory had waited too long with his claims. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later affirmed this decision in 2001.

==2010s==
On 15 November 2013, MGM and Danjaq LLC announced they had acquired all rights and interests of McClory&#x27;s estate. MGM, Danjaq, and the McClory estate issued a statement saying that they had brought to an &quot;amicable conclusion the legal and business disputes that have arisen periodically for over 50 years.&quot;

==Personal life==
McClory was married twice. He was survived by two sons and two daughters. His first wife was Frederica Ann &quot;Bobo&quot; Sigrist, daughter of Fred Sigrist. He later married Elizabeth O&#x27;Brien, daughter of the racehorse trainer Vincent O&#x27;Brien. They lived at Baltyboys House in Blessington, County Wicklow.

==Death==
McClory died on 20 November 2006, aged 82, at St. Columcille&#x27;s Hospital in the Dublin suburb of Loughlinstown, from a cerebral hemorrhage, four days after the British release of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

<doc id="849819" wikidata="Q4008761" url="?curid=849819" title="Variable camshaft timing">
<text>Variable camshaft timing (VCT) is an automobile variable valve timing technology developed by Ford. It allows for more optimum engine performance, reduced emissions, and increased fuel efficiency compared to engines with fixed camshafts. It uses electronically controlled hydraulic valves that direct high pressure engine oil into the camshaft phaser cavity. These oil control solenoids are bolted into the cylinder heads towards the front of the engine near the camshaft phasers. The powertrain control module (PCM) transmits a signal to the solenoids to move a valve spool that regulates the flow of oil to the phaser cavity. The phaser cavity changes the valve timing by rotating the camshaft slightly from its initial orientation, which results in the camshaft timing being advanced. The PCM adjusts the camshaft timing depending on factors such as engine load and RPM.

==History==
For twin-cam or DOHC engines, VCT was used on either the intake or exhaust camshaft. (Engines that have VCT on both camshafts are now designated as Ti-VCT.↓) The use of variable camshaft timing on the exhaust camshaft is for improved emissions, and vehicles with VCT on the exhaust camshaft do not require exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as retarding the exhaust cam timing achieves the same result. VCT on the intake camshaft is used primarily for increasing engine power and torque as the PCM is able to optimize the opening of the intake valves to match the engine conditions.

VCT is used in Ford&#x27;s Triton 5.4L 3-valve V8 engine, the Australian Barra 182 and 240 Inline-6s, and Ford&#x27;s 4.6L 3-valve V8 engine used in the 2006-2010 Ford Explorer and 2005-2010 Ford Mustang GT.

The 2.0L Zetec inline-4 used in the 1998–2003 Ford Escort ZX2, Ford Contour, and 1999–2002 Mercury Cougar used VCT on the exhaust camshaft. The 2002–2004 SVT Focus (ST170 in Europe) also featured VCT, but on the intake camshaft of its modified version of the 2.0L Zetec engine. In addition, the 1.7L Zetec-S engine found in the European Ford Puma was equipped with variable camshaft timing. The 6.2L V8 introduced in the 2010 SVT Raptor also uses VCT. That motor has a single cam per bank, so it is dual-equal variable cam timing.

==Ti-VCT==

&quot;Twin independent variable camshaft timing&quot; (&quot;Ti-VCT&quot;) is the name given by Ford to engines with the ability to advance or retard the timing of both the intake and exhaust camshafts independently, unlike the original versions of VCT, which only operated on a single camshaft. This allows for improved power and torque, particularly at lower engine RPM, as well as improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. Some Ford Ti-VCT engines use BorgWarner&#x27;s cam torque actuation (CTA) which utilizes the &quot;existing torsional energy in the valve train to rotate the camshaft&quot; instead of traditional oil pressure driven cam phasing.

Many new Ford engines feature Ti-VCT, including ones used in the 2011-2012 Mustangs, 2011 Edge and Edge Sport, 2011 Lincoln MKX, 2011 Fiesta, 2011 Explorer, 2011-2016 F-150, and 2012 Focus.

Engines using CTA system:

* 5.0 Coyote

Engines without CTA:

* 3.7 Cyclone

<text>Frans Ackerman (–1387), Latinised as Franciscus Agricola, was one of the most famous Flemish statesmen and military leaders of the 14th century.

==Life==

Ackerman was born in Ghent.
Rallying to Philip van Artevelde in the Ghent Revolt of 1379 against Louis II, Count of Flanders, Ackerman was placed in command of the &quot;Reisers&quot;, a mobile force of 3,000 men responsible for securing the city&#x27;s supply-lines with Liège, Brussels and Leuven. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Beverhoutsveld (3 May 1382), which led to the taking of Bruges and put almost all of Flanders under the control of Ghent. At the head of some troops, he scoured the surrounding country for provisions and thus saved Ghent from being starved into submission.

With the king of France lending support to the count of Flanders, Ackerman undertook an embassy to England to seek the intervention of King Richard II. During his absence, the rebels suffered a serious defeat in the Battle of Roosebeke (27 November 1382), where Van Artevelde himself was slain. The count regained control of all of Flanders except the city of Ghent, where Ackerman became the rebel leader.

The English launched Despenser&#x27;s Crusade in 1383, intervening in Flanders under the pretext of enforcing obedience to Pope Urban VI. Ackerman took Aardenburg from a French garrison, sacking the town and carrying the plunder to Ghent, and made an unsuccessful attempt on Bruges. Together with his English allies he was victorious at the Battle of Dunkirk (25 May 1383). He then took Oudenaarde by stratagem.

When the count died in 1384, he was succeeded by Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who had married the count&#x27;s daughter, Margaret III, Countess of Flanders. Duke Philip continued the war. Ackerman took the town of Damme in a surprise attack, but was soon besieged within it by the army of Charles VI of France. The expected help from the English not arriving, his force broke out and returned to Ghent.

On 18 December 1385, the war ended with the Peace of Tournai between Ghent and Philip the Bold. Ackerman was a prominent member of the Ghent delegation who agreed the terms, but afterwards declined to serve the duke either at court or in the field.

On 22 July 1387, while on his way to Saint Peter&#x27;s Abbey, Ghent, Ackerman was murdered by a son of the Lord of Herzele who blamed him for his father&#x27;s death.

<text>The WNBA draft is an annual draft held by the WNBA through which WNBA teams can select new players from a talent pool of college and professional women&#x27;s basketball players. The first WNBA draft was held in 1997.

==Eligibility==
The WNBA &quot;requires players to be at least 22, to have completed their college eligibility, to have graduated from a four-year college or to be four years removed from high school&quot;. Since the WNBA draft is currently held in April, before most U.S. colleges and universities have ended their academic years, the league considers anyone scheduled to graduate in the 3 months after the draft to be a &quot;graduate&quot; for draft purposes. The current rules for draft eligibility have been in place since at least 2014.

The specifics of this rule differ in several ways from those used by the NBA for its draft.

* Both drafts make a distinction between U.S. and &quot;international&quot; players. However, the definition of &quot;international player&quot; differs slightly between the two drafts. The NBA defines an &quot;international player&quot; as an individual who has permanently resided outside the U.S. for the three years preceding the draft while playing basketball (amateur or professional), did not complete high school education in the U.S., and has never enrolled in a U.S. college or university. A prospective NBA player&#x27;s birthplace or citizenship is not relevant to his status as an &quot;international player&quot;. On the other hand, the WNBA defines an &quot;international player&quot; as &quot;any person born and residing outside the United States who participates in the game of basketball as an amateur or professional&quot; (emphasis added), and who has never &quot;exercised intercollegiate basketball eligibility&quot; in the U.S. This means that a prospective WNBA player who was born in the United States is treated as a U.S. player, regardless of where she was educated or trained in basketball. Likewise, the association also defines as an &quot;international player&quot; a prospect with non-U.S. nationality even if one of her parents is a natural-born American, unless she has enrolled in a U.S. postsecondary institution.
* The current age limit for NBA draft eligibility is 19, measured on December 31 of the calendar year of the draft. The WNBA&#x27;s age limit is 20 for &quot;international players&quot; and 22 for U.S. players, both also being measured as of December 31 of the calendar year of the draft.
* A WNBA prospect who graduates from college while under the age limit can be eligible, but only if the calendar year of her college graduation is no earlier than the fourth after her high school graduation.
* In both drafts, players subject to the rules for U.S. players can declare early eligibility; however, the WNBA&#x27;s higher age limit means that very few such players have the option to make such a declaration.
* For those players who are eligible to declare early, the timing of the declaration process is dramatically different.
** NBA prospects must notify the league office of their intent to enter the draft no later than 60 days prior to the draft, which is currently held in June. Current rules allow prospects to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility, as long as they comply with NCAA rules regarding relationships with agents, do not sign a professional contract, and notify the league office of their withdrawal no later than 10 days after the end of the NBA Draft Combine.
** WNBA prospects must notify the league office no later than 10 days before the draft, and must renounce any remaining college eligibility to enter the draft. However, because postseason national tournaments (most notably the NCAA Division I tournament) are still ongoing during the 10 days prior to the draft, certain players who would otherwise be eligible to declare cannot do so before the standard deadline. A prospect whose team is still playing during the 10-day window must make her declaration within the 24 hours following her team&#x27;s final game of the season, but no less than 3 hours before the scheduled start of the draft. The 3-hour period is a historic artifact that stems from the former scheduling of the WNBA draft; from 2006 to 2008, it was held in the city of the women&#x27;s Final Four on the day after the championship game. Despite media commentary that argued that players involved in the NCAA tournament needed more time to make draft decisions, the most recent WNBA CBA, agreed to in 2020, did not change any draft eligibility rules.

For the 2021 draft only, the league and its players union, the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Players Association, agreed to modified eligibility rules due to changes brought on by COVID-19. The most significant change is that all age-eligible college players who wished to enter that draft had to opt in. Because the NCAA ruled that the 2020–21 season would not count against the eligibility of any basketball player, everyone who played in that season, regardless of class, had remaining athletic eligibility at the time of the draft. Players who wished to enter the 2021 draft had to renounce college eligibility and notify the WNBA offices by email no later than April 1 of that year. Players involved in the 2021 Final Four had 48 hours after the completion of their final game, instead of the normal 24, to notify the league of their intent to enter the draft.

==Structure==
The 1997 WNBA draft was divided into three parts. The first part was the initial allocation of 16 players into individual teams. Players such as Cynthia Cooper and Michelle Timms were assigned to different teams. The second part was the WNBA Elite draft, which was composed of professional women&#x27;s basketball players who had competed in other leagues. The last part would be the 4 rounds of the regular draft.

The next three seasons to follow 1998, 1999 and 2000 would all have expansion drafts. There would not be another expansion draft until the 2006 season.

All seasons before 2002 had 4 rounds. Since 2003, all drafts are 3 rounds.

In 2003 and 2004, there were dispersal drafts due to the folding of the Cleveland Rockers, Miami Sol and Portland Fire. The players from Rockers, Sol and Fire were reallocated to existing teams. There were also dispersal drafts in 2007 with the folding of the Charlotte Sting, 2009 with the shuttering of the Houston Comets, and in 2010 when the Maloofs cast off the Sacramento Monarchs to focus their resources on the Kings franchise in the NBA.

==Players selected==
There are no restrictions on what part of the world the players come from (though under varying rules, international players have been subject to tighter age restrictions within the draft than college players). However, college sports governing bodies, most notably the NCAA, prohibit players from competing in professional leagues simultaneously with their college eligibility. Once the player has joined the WNBA, she is eligible to participate in overseas leagues during the WNBA offseason (many WNBA players play in Europe, Australia, or more recently China).

===First picks===

Dena Head is the oldest No. 1 draft pick (she was 27 years old), having graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1992 and the first player ever drafted to the WNBA. Lauren Jackson is the youngest No. 1 draft pick, being drafted at the age of 19. As of 2012, six first picks have gone on to win WNBA Championships, with 12 rings among them. In the seventeen seasons that the WNBA has been in existence, eight No. 1 draft picks have helped lead their teams to a playoff berth in their rookie year.

<doc id="849826" wikidata="Q914983" url="?curid=849826" title="Soyuz T-5">
<text>Soyuz T-5 was a human spaceflight into Earth orbit to the then new Salyut 7 space station in 1982. While the Soyuz-T was docked it received visits from the uncrewed Progress 13 resupply spacecraft, and the crewed Soyuz T-6 and Soyuz T-7.

The first crew hand launched an amateur radio satellite, the T-6 mission included a visiting Frenchman, and T-7 included the first woman in space in 20 years. It was the first mission to Salyut 7, but more than one spacecraft could be docked to S7 at a time, which is why the later missions could overlap with Soyuz T-5. The spacecraft launched with two people (&quot;Elbrus crew&quot;), and returned with three (&quot;Dnieper crew&quot;).

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 6850 kg
*Perigee: 190 km
*Apogee: 231 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 89.7 minutes

==Mission highlights==

This was the first (1st) expedition to the new Salyut 7 space station, launched into Earth orbit earlier in 1982. Salyut 7 was similar to the Salyut 6 (1977–1982) space station it superseded, but featured a number of improvements. The Soyuz T-5 spacecraft docked with Salyut 7 in orbit, and it was visited by the 2nd and 3rd expeditions to the space station. One advantage the new Salyut 7 station had over Salyut 6, was continuously available hot water.

The Elbrus crew ejected a 28-kg amateur radio satellite from a Salyut 7 trash airlock on May 17, 1982. The Soviets called this the first launch of a communications satellite from a crewed space vehicle. They did this ahead of the launch of two large geostationary satellites from the U.S. Space Shuttle (STS-5, November 11–16, 1982).

On May 25, the Elbrus crew reoriented Salyut 7 so the aft end of the Progress pointed toward Earth. This placed the station in gravity-gradient stabilization. Lebedev remarked in his diary that the attitude control jets were “very noisy,” and that they sounded like “hitting a barrel with a sledgehammer.” Of Salyut 7 during the unpacking of Progress 13, Lebedev said, “It looks like we’re getting ready to move or have just moved to a new apartment.” The following day the Elbrus crew closed the hatch from the work compartment into the intermediate compartment so the TsUP could pump fuel from Progress 13 to Salyut 7. The crew monitored the operation but played little active role in it. May 29 was spent organizing the supplies delivered. At the same time, according to Lebedev, “we filled the resupply ship with what we don’t need and tied them down with ropes. When I enter the resupply ship, it jingles with a metallic sound, so when we separate it will sound like a brass band.” Progress 13 pumped 300 liters of water aboard on May 31. On June 2 Progress 13 lowered the station&#x27;s orbit to 300 km to receive Soyuz T-6.

In July, Valentin Lebedev, in charge of the plant experiments, reported that the Arabidopsis plants, chosen for their short 40-day lifecycle, had become the first plants to flower and produce seeds in the zero gravity of space, a Guinness World Record. 

===End of T-5===

The Soyuz T-5 spacecraft was undocked in August 1982, leaving Salyut 7 and Soyuz T-7 spacecraft in orbit. The spacecraft returned to Earth successfully with Popov, Serebrov and Savitskaya, also called the &quot;Dneiper crew&quot;. The Soyuz T-5 had been in space six weeks.

The initial &quot;Elbrus crew&quot;, would return to Earth in the Soyuz T-7 spacecraft in December 1982.

<doc id="849837" wikidata="Q85850272" url="?curid=849837" title="Black Belt (geological formation)">
<text>Black Belt is a physical geography term referring to a roughly crescent-shaped geological formation of dark fertile soil in the Southern United States. It is about long and up to wide in c. east–west orientation, mostly in central Alabama and northeast Mississippi.

During the Cretaceous period, about 145 to 66 million years ago, most of what are now the central plains and the Southeastern United States were covered by shallow seas. Tiny marine plankton grew in those seas, and their carbonate skeletons accumulated into massive chalk formations. That chalk eventually became a fertile soil, highly suitable for growing crops. The Black Belt arc was the shoreline of one of those seas, where large amounts of chalk had collected in the shallow waters.

== History ==
Before the 19th century, this region was a mosaic of prairies and oak-hickory forest.

In the 1820s and 1830s, the region was identified as prime land for upland cotton plantations. Short-staple cotton did well here, and its profitable processing was made possible by invention of the cotton gin. It grew better in the upland regions than the long-staple cotton of the Low Country.

===Socioeconomic region===

After 1865, the phrase was sometimes used to describe a geopolitical region, much as the terms Snow Belt, Rust Belt, Sun Belt, and Bible Belt are used today. Booker T. Washington wrote in his 1901 autobiography
I have often been asked to define the term &quot;Black Belt&quot;. So far as I can learn, the term was first used to designate a part of the country which was distinguished by the colour of the soil. The part of the country possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers. Later, and especially since the war, the term seems to be used wholly in a political sense—that is, to designate the counties where the black people outnumber the white.

Since the 1920s the term &quot;Black Belt&quot; fell out of favor as a term outside of the specialized field of physical geology, but various authors have written about the fact that the Black Belt geographical formation contained a large number of slaves before the American Civil War, many of whom worked the cotton plantations. Some publications still use the phrase to refer to the geopolitical region.

<text>Jolbert Alexis Cabrera Ramírez (born December 8, 1972) is a Colombian former baseball player. Previously, he played in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians (1998–2002), Los Angeles Dodgers (2002–2003), Seattle Mariners (2004), and Cincinnati Reds (2008). Cabrera hits and throws right-handed. He is the older brother of former shortstop Orlando Cabrera. The two played together during the 1997 season while members of the Ottawa Lynx, the Montreal Expos Triple-A affiliate.

== Professional career ==
Cabrera made his major league debut with the Indians on April 12, 1998, in the only game he played that season. 

2001 was Cabrera&#x27;s best statistical season in Cleveland, as he slashed a line of .261/3/38 with ten stolen bases for the division-winning Indians. A highlight of that 2001 season was in a nationally televised Sunday Night Baseball game on August 5, when Cleveland rallied from a 14–2 deficit in the seventh inning to win 15–14 on Cabrera&#x27;s broken-bat, walk-off single off José Paniagua.

Cabrera was traded on July 22, 2002, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor league pitcher Lance Caraccioli. He remained there until an early season trade in 2004 sent him to Seattle. He was released in 2005. 

During the 2007 offseason, Cabrera signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals that included an invitation to spring training. After spending most of the year with their Triple-A affiliate, the Memphis Redbirds, Cabrera was released and signed a minor league contract with Colorado Rockies. 

On January 5, 2008, Cabrera signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds and was called up to the majors on June 10. On September 7, 2008, Cabrera hit a walk-off single against the Cubs to win the game 4–3.

On January 12, 2009, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Baltimore Orioles. 

On January 15, 2010, it was reported that Cabrera had signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets with an invitation to spring training.

In an eight-year career, Cabrera had a batting average of .257 with 18 home runs and 157 RBI in 609 games.

== Coaching career ==
In 2017, Cabrera was a coach for Colombia in the World Baseball Classic, and in the 2023 WBC, he served as the team&#x27;s manager.

== Personal life ==
Cabrera currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona.

<text>The 2005–06 season was the 126th season of competitive association football in England.

==Overview==
* Chelsea land their second Premier League title in as many seasons. They headed the table virtually all season long and amassed 91 points in retaining the trophy. 
*The rebuilt Wembley Stadium was due to open in time for the FA Cup final in May. However, in August 2005, The Football Association reserved the Millennium Stadium as a backup, as there was some doubt whether Wembley would be ready. The doubts were confirmed on 21 February 2006, when The FA announced that the final would indeed be held at Millennium Stadium. On 31 March 2006 The FA confirmed that the new Wembley would not be opened until 2007.
*Two clubs opened new stadiums at the beginning of this season:
**Coventry City – Ricoh Arena.
**Swansea City – Liberty Stadium.
*F.C. United of Manchester, formed by disgruntled Manchester United fans, played their first competitive season, competing in the North West Counties Football League Division Two (level 10 of the English football league system), from which they gained promotion at the first time of asking.
*Reading broke the previous points record of 105 points, taking 106 points from 46 games, scoring 99 goals to earn promotion to the Premier League.
*Wigan Athletic, who earned promotion to the Premier League by finishing second in the Football League Championship, played their first ever season in the top division of English football and comfortably stayed up, staying clear from the threat of relegation all season.
**Wigan were the first club to play an inaugural season in the top tier of English football since Barnsley in 1997–98, and the first to avoid relegation in an inaugural top tier season since Millwall in 1988–89.

===FA Premier League===
Chelsea, on 91 points, won their second Premier League title in a row. Manchester United, whose 83-point tally would have been enough for title glory in most seasons, finished runners-up. Liverpool&#x27;s league form improved drastically following the previous season and they finished in third place, just one point behind United; in addition, they also won the FA Cup, giving manager Rafael Benítez his second major trophy in just his second season. Arsenal snatched the last Champions League spot from under the noses of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, after the latter&#x27;s players went down with a bout of food-poisoning. &quot;The Gunners&quot;&#x27; 4–2 victory over Wigan Athletic on the final day of the season saw them end 92 years of playing at Highbury before they moved into their new 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium.

Ultimately joining Tottenham in the UEFA Cup were Blackburn Rovers and West Ham United who were promoted the previous season and took the European spot by virtue of being FA Cup runners-up. Despite narrowly losing on penalties to Liverpool, the Hammers enjoyed a successful first season back amongst the elite, finishing in a comfortable 9th place.

Fellow newly promoted side Wigan Athletic, who were many pundit&#x27;s tip for relegation in pre-season, defied the odds to finish 10th in their first season in the top-flight. Everton crashed out of the Champions League early and were in the relegation zone by October, but a good run of results both after Halloween and in the new year saw them comfortably finish in 11th. Middlesbrough finished 14th after a disappointing league season, but did reach the UEFA Cup Final – the first European final in their history – where they were beaten 4–0 by Sevilla.

In contrast to the other promoted sides, Sunderland, last seasons Championship winners, were relegated with a league record low of 15 points, breaking the previous record that they set themselves in 2002–03, while West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City both hit the 30-point mark and battled bravely, but both were unable to avoid relegation after dismal runs of league form (the Baggies going winless from February onwards, with Birmingham unable to shake off poor away form). Portsmouth spent almost the entire season in the relegation zone, but after the return of Harry Redknapp (many Portsmouth fans were convinced Redknapp only went to bitter rivals Southampton last season just to get them relegated), they stayed up after a late run of good results.

Leading goalscorer: Thierry Henry (Arsenal) – 27

===The Football League===

====Football League Championship====

Reading entered the top flight for the first time in their history, breaking Sunderland&#x27;s points record of 105 in the process by accumulating 106 points (coincidentally, Sunderland were relegated from the Premier League while breaking the record for &quot;lowest&quot; number of points under the current scoring system). Sheffield United joined them, returning to the Premier League after twelve years and earning Neil Warnock his fourth promotion as a manager. Surprise package Watford, initially tipped for relegation, entered the play-offs and beat Leeds United 3–0 in the Millennium Stadium final, who were unable to shake off a bad run of form (worse than any of the three relegated sides) that saw them lose out in the race for automatic promotion.

Crystal Palace fared the best out of the teams relegated from the Premier League the previous season, by getting to the play-offs but losing in the semi-finals. Norwich City never managed better than mid-table, while Southampton endured an awful season that saw Sir Clive Woodward take up a much-criticized role as director of football, manager Harry Redknapp return to local rivals Portsmouth and the side looking in danger of relegation for much of the season, only managing a mid-table finish with a late surge in form, thanks to the appointment of George Burley. Chairman Rupert Lowe ultimately paid the price by being forced to resign after the end of the season.

The relegation battle was principally fought by four sides: Crewe, Brighton, Millwall and Sheffield Wednesday. Wednesday ultimately won the battle, and the remaining three were relegated all on the same day, after Wednesday beat Brighton 2–0. Although Crewe and Brighton had not spent long in the division and were considered to be punching above their weight, Millwall underwent a disastrous season, getting through five managers and four chairmen before relegation.

Leading goalscorer: Marlon King (Watford) – 21

====Football League One====

Southend United surprised many by winning a second successive promotion, returning to the Championship after nearly a decade (when it was called Division One). Colchester United also made the Championship for the first time in their history, but their promotion was tempered by the loss of manager Phil Parkinson to Hull City. A highly competitive play-off race saw Barnsley emerge as winners, beating Swansea City at the Millennium Stadium 4–3 on penalties after both normal time and extra-time finished 2–2, to return to the Championship after three seasons of struggle in Division Two/League One.

Following relegation and becoming the first former European champions to be subsequently relegated to the third tier of their domestic league, Nottingham Forest struggled for most of the season and were in danger of suffering a second successive relegation. The departure of Gary Megson saw a late upturn in form and surge towards the play-offs; however, they missed out on the last day of the season, finishing 7th.

At the bottom, Walsall endured their second relegation in three seasons, Swindon became the first former Premier League side to slip to the bottom division. Hartlepool crashed out of the division after nearly earning promotion last season, while MK Dons suffered the relegation they only avoided the previous season when Wrexham were docked points for entering administration.

Leading goalscorers: Billy Sharp (Scunthorpe United) – 23, and Freddy Eastwood (Southend United) – 23

====Football League Two====

Carlisle United were another side who earned a second successive promotion, only two years after a relegation from the League that some predicted would see the end of the club. Northampton Town joined them, making up for two seasons of play-off disappointment, and Leyton Orient ended a decade in the bottom division by earning promotion in almost the last minute of the season. Grimsby Town conceded on 91 minutes, and 14 seconds after the fans of Orient celebrated, Lee Steele scored to seal promotion for Orient. Wycombe started the season with a 21-game unbeaten run that saw five of their players named in the PFA League Two team of the year. Two tragic off-the-field events, however, saw them fall away in the second part of the season before losing to Cheltenham Town in the playoff semi-finals. Grimsby Town lost 1–0 to Cheltenham in the final at the Millennium Stadium.

Rushden &amp; Diamonds failed to improve on the previous season, and paid the price with relegation to the Conference. Oxford United joined them, despite the return of manager Jim Smith, and became the first former winners of a major trophy to be relegated to the Conference, doing so on the last day of the season.

Leading goalscorer: Rickie Lambert (Rochdale) – 22

<text>Nano-RAM is a proprietary computer memory technology from the company Nantero. It is a type of nonvolatile random-access memory based on the position of carbon nanotubes deposited on a chip-like substrate. In theory, the small size of the nanotubes allows for very high density memories. Nantero also refers to it as NRAM.

==Technology==
The first generation Nantero NRAM technology was based on a three-terminal semiconductor device where a third terminal is used to switch the memory cell between memory states. The second generation NRAM technology is based on a two-terminal memory cell. The two-terminal cell has advantages such as a smaller cell size, better scalability to sub-20 nm nodes (see semiconductor device fabrication), and the ability to passivate the memory cell during fabrication.

In a non-woven fabric matrix of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), crossed nanotubes can either be touching or slightly separated depending on their position. When touching, the carbon nanotubes are held together by Van der Waals forces. Each NRAM &quot;cell&quot; consists of an interlinked network of CNTs located between two electrodes as illustrated in Figure 1. The CNT fabric is located between two metal electrodes, which is defined and etched by photolithography, and forms the NRAM cell.

The NRAM acts as a resistive non-volatile random-access memory (RAM) and can be placed in two or more resistive modes depending on the resistive state of the CNT fabric. When the CNTs are not in contact the resistance state of the fabric is high and represents an &quot;off&quot; or &quot;0&quot; state. When the CNTs are brought into contact, the resistance state of the fabric is low and represents an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;1&quot; state. NRAM acts as a memory because the two resistive states are very stable. In the 0 state, the CNTs (or a portion of them) are not in contact and remain in a separated state due to the stiffness of the CNTs resulting in a high resistance or low current measurement state between the top and bottom electrodes. In the 1 state, the CNTs (or a portion of them) are in contact and remain contacted due to Van der Waals forces between the CNTs, resulting in a low resistance or high current measurement state between the top and bottom electrodes. Note that other sources of resistance such as contact resistance between electrode and CNT can be significant and also need to be considered.

To switch the NRAM between states, a small voltage greater than the read voltage is applied between top and bottom electrodes. If the NRAM is in the 0 state, the voltage applied will cause an electrostatic attraction between the CNTs close to each other causing a SET operation. After the applied voltage is removed, the CNTs remain in a 1 or low resistance state due to physical adhesion (Van der Waals force) with an activation energy (Ea) of approximately 5eV. If the NRAM cell is in the 1 state, applying a voltage greater than the read voltage will generate CNT phonon excitations with sufficient energy to separate the CNT junctions. This is the phonon driven RESET operation. The CNTs remain in the OFF or high resistance state due to the high mechanical stiffness (Young&#x27;s Modulus 1 TPa) with an activation energy (Ea) much greater than 5 eV. Figure 2 illustrates both states of an individual pair of CNTs involved in the switch operation. Due to the high activation energy (&gt; 5eV) required for switching between states, the NRAM switch resists outside interference like radiation and operating temperature that can erase or flip conventional memories like DRAM.

NRAMs are fabricated by depositing a uniform layer of CNTs onto a prefabricated array of drivers such as transistors as shown in Figure 1. The bottom electrode of the NRAM cell is in contact with the underlying via (electronics) connecting the cell to the driver. The bottom electrode may be fabricated as part of the underlying via or it may be fabricated simultaneously with the NRAM cell, when the cell is photolithographically defined and etched. Before the cell is photolithographically defined and etched, the top electrode is deposited as a metal film onto the CNT layer so that the top metal electrode is patterned and etched during the definition of the NRAM cell. Following the dielectric passivation and fill of the array, the top metal electrode is exposed by etching back the overlying dielectric using a smoothing process such as chemical-mechanical planarization. With the top electrode exposed, the next level of metal wiring interconnect is fabricated to complete the NRAM array. Figure 3 illustrates one circuit method to select a single cell for writing and reading. Using a cross-grid interconnect arrangement, the NRAM and driver, (the cell), forms a memory array similar to other memory arrays. A single cell can be selected by applying the proper voltages to the word line (WL), bit line (BL), and select lines (SL) without disturbing the other cells in the array. Alternatively between the bottom electrode and top metal layer they may be two layers of CNTs: one with uniformly arranged CNTs, and another with randomly arranged CNTs. The uniformly arranged CNTs are used to protect the randomly arranged CNTs from the top metal layer.

==Characteristics==
NRAM has a density, at least in theory, similar to that of DRAM. DRAM includes capacitors, which are essentially two small metal plates with a thin insulator between them. NRAM has terminals and electrodes roughly the same size as the plates in a DRAM, the nanotubes between them being so much smaller they add nothing to the overall size. However it seems there is a minimum size at which a DRAM can be built, below which there is simply not enough charge being stored on the plates. NRAM appears to be limited only by lithography. This means that NRAM may be able to become much denser than DRAM, perhaps also less expensive. Unlike DRAM, NRAM does not require power to &quot;refresh&quot; it, and will retain its memory even after power is removed. Thus the power needed to write and retain the memory state of the device is much lower than DRAM, which has to build up charge on the cell plates. This means that NRAM might compete with DRAM in terms of cost, but also require less power, and as a result also be much faster because write performance is largely determined by the total charge needed. NRAM can theoretically reach performance similar to SRAM, which is faster than DRAM but much less dense, and thus much more expensive.

==Comparison with other non-volatile memory==
Compared with other non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) technologies, NRAM has several advantages. In flash memory, the common form of NVRAM, each cell resembles a MOSFET transistor with a control gate (CG) modulated by a floating gate (FG) interposed between the CG and the FG. The FG is surrounded by an insulating dielectric, typically an oxide. Since the FG is electrically isolated by the surrounding dielectric, any electrons placed on the FG will be trapped on the FG which screens the CG from the channel of the transistor and modifies the threshold voltage (VT) of the transistor. By writing and controlling the amount of charge placed on the FG, the FG controls the conduction state of the MOSFET flash device depending on the VT of the cell selected. The current flowing through the MOSFET channel is sensed to determine the state of the cell forming a binary code where a 1 state (current flow) when an appropriate CG voltage is applied and a 0 state (no current flow) when the CG voltage is applied.

After being written to, the insulator traps electrons on the FG, locking it into the 0 state. However, in order to change that bit, the insulator has to be &quot;overcharged&quot; to erase any charge already stored in it. This requires higher voltage, about 10 volts, much more than a battery can provide. Flash systems include a &quot;charge pump&quot; that slowly builds up power and releases it at higher voltage. This process is not only slow, but degrades the insulators. For this reason flash has a limited number of writes before the device will no longer operate effectively.

NRAM reads and writes are both &quot;low energy&quot; in comparison to flash (or DRAM for that matter due to &quot;refresh&quot;), meaning NRAM could have longer battery life. It may also be much faster to write than either, meaning it may be used to replace both. Modern phones include flash memory for storing phone numbers, DRAM for higher performance working memory because flash is too slow, and some SRAM for even higher performance. Some NRAM could be placed on the CPU to act as the CPU cache, and more in other chips replacing both the DRAM and flash.

NRAM is one of a variety of new memory systems, many of which claim to be &quot;universal&quot; in the same fashion as NRAM – replacing everything from flash to DRAM to SRAM.

An alternative memory ready for use is ferroelectric RAM (FRAM or FeRAM). FeRAM adds a small amount of a ferro-electric material to a DRAM cell. The state of the field in the material encodes the bit in a non-destructive format. FeRAM has advantages of NRAM, although the smallest possible cell size is much larger than for NRAM. FeRAM is used in applications where the limited number of writes of flash is an issue. FeRAM read operations are destructive, requiring a restoring write operation afterwards.

Other more speculative memory systems include magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) and phase-change memory (PRAM). MRAM is based on a grid of magnetic tunnel junctions. MRAM&#x27;s reads the memory using the tunnel magnetoresistance effect, allowing it to read the memory both non-destructively and with very little power. Early MRAM used field induced writing, reached a limit in terms of size, which kept it much larger than flash devices. However, new MRAM techniques might overcome the size limitation to make MRAM competitive even with flash memory. The techniques are Thermal Assisted Switching (TAS), developed by Crocus Technology, and Spin-transfer torque on which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and other companies were working in 2009.

PRAM is based on a technology similar to that in a writable CD or DVD, using a phase-change material that changes its magnetic or electrical properties instead of its optical ones. The PRAM material itself is scalable but requires a larger current source.

==History==

Nantero was founded in 2001, and headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts. Due to the massive investment in flash semiconductor fabrication plants, no alternative memory has replaced flash in the marketplace, despite predictions as early as 2003 of the impending speed and density of NRAM.

In 2005, NRAM was promoted as universal memory, and Nantero predicted it would be in production by the end of 2006.
In August 2008, Lockheed Martin acquired an exclusive license for government applications of Nantero&#x27;s intellectual property.

By early 2009, Nantero had 30 US patents and 47 employees, but was still in the engineering phase. In May 2009, a radiation-resistant version of NRAM was tested on the STS-125 mission of the US .

The company was quiet until another round of funding and collaboration with the Belgian research center imec was announced in November 2012.
Nantero raised a total of over $42 million through the November 2012 series D round.
Investors included Charles River Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Globespan Capital Partners, Stata Venture Partners and Harris &amp; Harris Group.
In May 2013, Nantero completed series D with an investment by Schlumberger.
&quot;EE Times&quot; listed Nantero as one of &quot;10 top startups to watch in 2013&quot;.

31 Aug 2016: Two Fujitsu semiconductor businesses are licensing Nantero NRAM technology with joint Nantero–Fujitsu development to produce chips, announced in 2018. They are announced to have several thousand times faster rewrites and many thousands of times more rewrite cycles than embedded flash memory. As of 2024, these products are still announced but have not reached the market.

<text>Soyuz T-6 was a human spaceflight to Earth orbit to the Salyut 7 space station in 1982. Along with two Soviet cosmonauts, the crew included a Frenchman, Jean-Loup Chrétien.

The Soyuz-T spacecraft arrived at Salyut 7 following launch on 24 June 1982 and one day of solo operations. During the T-6 mission&#x27;s time docked to the station, the crew performed joint Soviet-French experiments, including cardiovascular echography, alongside the station&#x27;s resident crew.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 6850 kg
*Perigee: 189 km
*Apogee: 233 km
*Inclination: 51.7°
*Period: 88.7 minutes

==Mission highlights==

Soyuz T-6 launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 24 June 1982 at 16:29 GMT. Docking with the Salyut 7 station was completed manually after problems arose with the spacecraft&#x27;s onboard automatic docking systems.

Once aboard Salyut 7, the crew completed joint Soviet-French, including echography and antibiotic experiments, with the station&#x27;s resident crew, the crew of Soyuz T-5.

The mission transported the first French astronaut, Jean-Loup Chrétien, into space. While aboard the station, the resident crew afforded him the opportunity to eject Salyut 7&#x27;s weekly bag of waste into space through the station&#x27;s small trash airlock. Valentin Lebedev, writing in his diary, quoted Chrétien as saying Salyut 7 &quot;is simple, doesn&#x27;t look impressive, but is reliable.&quot;

<text>Resonance 104.4 FM is a London based non-profit community radio station specialising in the arts run by the London Musicians&#x27; Collective (LMC). The station is staffed by two permanent staff members, including Chief Executive Officer Peter Lanceley and over 300 volunteer technical and production staff.

Until September 2007, its studios were located on Denmark Street before moving to its second location at 144 Borough High Street, Southwark. The station is now located at 7 Risborough Street, Southwark, and broadcasts to a radius on 104.4 MHz FM from a transmitter on the roof of Guy&#x27;s Hospital at London Bridge. Its schedule includes nearly 100 shows catering to many sub-communities of the London area on a wide variety of subjects including a multitude of musical genres, local and foreign current affairs and subjects of local interest. Noted for its policy of giving broadcasters free rein of their creative outlet, it has been described by &quot;Time Out&quot; as &quot;brilliantly eccentric&quot;. The station receives funding grants from Arts Council England.

==Ethos==
The station describes itself as &quot;the world&#x27;s first radio art station&quot; which aims to provide a radical alternative to mainstream broadcasting. Resonance 104.4 FM features programmes made by musicians, artists and critics who represent the diversity of London’s arts scenes, with regular weekly contributions from nearly two hundred musicians, artists, thinkers, critics, activists and instigators; plus numerous unique broadcasts by artists on the weekday &quot;Clear Spot&quot;.

The station presents material ranging from a programme presented by the staff of the experimental music magazine &quot;The Wire&quot; to &quot;Calling All Pensioners&quot;, which aims to inform the elderly about local events and benefits entitlement. Live music sessions are featured on shows such as &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;, &quot;You Are Hear&quot;, Hooting Yard on the Air, and &quot;Glass Shrimp&quot;. Other shows include foreign-language programmes aimed at communities in London that are not served by other broadcasters.

In addition to locally produced programming, Resonance is a member of Radia and a rebroadcaster of American news program &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;. Resonance FM has received a Sony Award nomination for &quot;The Good Drugs Guide&quot;, a documentary series presented by Piers Gibbon and David McCandless. The station has been profiled in the pages of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Morning Star&quot; amongst others.

In 2006 the station was nominated for &quot;The Community Award&quot; by the Sony Radio Academy Awards, but has won the Radio Academy Nations and Regions Award for London for three consecutive years between 2009 and 2011 Station manager Ed Baxter was nominated for &quot;Programmer of the Year&quot; by the Sony Radio Academy Awards in 2010.

==History==
The London Musicians&#x27; Collective originally put together a four-week programme of radio art as part of 1998&#x27;s Meltdown festival at the South Bank Centre, curated by John Peel. The station operated from the Royal Festival Hall on a month-long Restricted Service Licence on 107.3 FM.

Phil England, an organiser of the original broadcast, described the origins of the station in a text written to accompany the printed programme. The aim, he wrote, was &quot;to raise the specter of radio art in a country where the notion has no common currency&quot;.

After a four-year hiatus, the station returned on 1 May 2002 as part of the Ofcom Access Radio Pilot Scheme from studios on Denmark Street in the Soho area of London&#x27;s West End.

Resonance was awarded a five-year Community Radio licence in December 2005, enabling the station to broadcast 24/7. Ofcom extended the station&#x27;s FM broadcasting licence in July 2010.

Resonance FM resumed scheduled broadcasting in September 2007 after a short hiatus whilst moving into a new studio building on Borough High Street, Southwark; a short walk from the area where they launched in 1998.

In 2011, Resonance presented a six-week exhibit at the Raven Row Gallery Exhibit in East London. The exhibition theme was the relation of sound to art, and included work from Max Eastley and Takehisa Kosugi.

==Broadcasting==
The station is broadcast from a transmitter on the roof of Guy&#x27;s Hospital at London Bridge on 104.4 MHz FM. The transmission power is low compared with London&#x27;s main radio stations due to the terms of its community radio licence. It can be received throughout central London but does not cover the whole Greater London area. Interference from local pirate radio stations, particularly at weekends, has been and is a problem in some areas. It can also be streamed from the station&#x27;s web site. Resonance uploads every show to its Mixcloud account throughout each day.

==Funding==
The station receives funding grants from Arts Council England as part of the national portfolio funding programme, which began in 2012. The grant for 2012–2013 was £160,000; 2013–2014 £163,680; 2014–2015 £167,936.

<doc id="849863" wikidata="Q653395" url="?curid=849863" title="Soyuz T-7">
<text>Soyuz T-7 (; code name Dnieper) was the third Soviet space mission to the Salyut 7 space station. Crew member Svetlana Savitskaya was the first woman in space in almost twenty years, since Valentina Tereshkova who flew in 1963 on Vostok 6.

Savitskaya was given the orbital module of Soyuz T-7 for privacy. The Soyuz T-7 crew delivered experiments and mail from home to the Elbrus crew. On August 21 the five cosmonauts traded seat liners between the Soyuz Ts. The Dnieper undocked in Soyuz T-5, leaving the newer Soyuz T-7 spacecraft for the long-duration crew.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission highlights==

Soyuz T-7 was an early flight to Salyut 7, the Soviet successor to Salyut 6. The crew which launched on Soyuz T-7 remained aboard the station for eight days, as a short-term &quot;visiting crew&quot;, accompanying the station&#x27;s long-term resident crew. The crew exchanged Soyuz vehicles with the resident crew, returning home in the older Soyuz T-5, leaving the fresher Soyuz T-7 available to the resident crew as a return vehicle. This practice had been used several times on Salyut 6.

Savitskaya became the second woman in space, and the first to visit a space station.

==Mission parameters==
* Mass: 6,850 kg
* Perigee: 289 km

<text>Mary-Kay Wilmers, Hon. FRSL (born 19 July 1938) is an American editor and journalist. She was the editor of the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; from 1992 to 2021, and she remains consulting editor. She is a recipient of the Benson Medal from the Royal Society of Literature.

==Family and education==

Mary-Kay Wilmers was born in Chicago, Illinois and grew up in New York City. She lived in the United States for the first eight years of her childhood, by the end of which she had lived in 10 different homes and attended eight different schools in America and Europe. Her mother, Cecilia Eitington, was of Russian-Jewish descent, and her father&#x27;s family were, she said, &quot;very English&quot;, but they had come from Germany. For many years Wilmers worked on a book, published in 2009 as &quot;The Eitingons: A Twentieth Century Story&quot;, recounting the story of her mother&#x27;s Russian relations, including the psychoanalyst Max Eitingon, as well as her grandfather&#x27;s cousin Leonid Eitingon, an agent in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s NKVD who was responsible for masterminding the assassination of Leon Trotsky.

In 1946 Wilmers&#x27; parents moved to Europe, spending time in London, Portugal, Belgium, and Switzerland. Her father Charles Wilmers was President of Sofina, a Belgian multinational utilities holding company. Wilmers was educated in Brussels and at boarding school in England. She said that for some time she was happier speaking French than English. Her brother Robert G. Wilmers was an American billionaire and chairman of M&amp;T Bank until his death in 2017.

At Oxford University, where Wilmers read modern languages at St Hugh&#x27;s College from 1957, she befriended Alan Bennett, later a regular contributor to the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. Bennett said about Wilmers&#x27;s time at university: &quot;Outside the novels of Nancy Mitford or Evelyn Waugh, I had never come across anyone who behaved so confidently or in such a cosmopolitan fashion&quot;. For the week of her finals she moved into the Randolph Hotel, staying with her father whose presence was required due to her threat to not sit the exams.

==Career==

===Early career===
After her graduation in 1960, she thought about becoming a translator at the United Nations, but instead went to work at the publishers Faber and Faber, employed at first as a secretary. On one occasion she thought she might be sacked for saying &quot;bugger&quot; in front of T. S. Eliot, whose letters she used to type. She later became an editor at Faber and Faber, where she commissioned many books, among them &quot;Patriarchal Attitudes&quot; by Eva Figes, one of the first works of British feminism. She left Faber aged 29 to become deputy editor of &quot;The Listener&quot;, edited by Karl Miller, and in the 1970s had a spell at &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (&quot;TLS&quot;).

===&quot;London Review of Books&quot;===

In 1979, Wilmers joined Miller in founding &quot;London Review of Books&quot; (&quot;LRB&quot;), conceived to fill a gap in the market as a year-long industrial dispute had closed &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. The new review was an offshoot of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, at first appearing folded inside the older publication. The first edition appeared in October 1979.

&quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; withdrew its support after a few months, and in May 1980, Wilmers made the first of a number of investments of money inherited from her father, establishing an independent &quot;London Review of Books&quot; and later making herself the majority shareholder. In January 2010, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the review was £27 million in debt to the Wilmers family trust. &quot;It&#x27;s family money and the debts have been rising for many years,&quot; Wilmers said. &quot;But I really just look after the commas.&quot;

Wilmers became co-editor in 1988 and editor in 1992. Her style was to take a highly interventionist approach: &quot;You want to help readers along. Not discourage them by making them go through a swamp of unnecessary sentences&quot;, she said. Her friend Hilary Mantel called Wilmers &quot;a presiding genius&quot;, and Andrew O&#x27;Hagan explained: &quot;She can’t bear a lazy sentence or secondhand metaphor. She’s tireless in her commitment to the paper&quot;. In 2009 the &quot;London Review&quot;″s circulation was 48,000, making it the largest-selling literary publication in Europe. Wilmers stepped down as editor after almost 30 years in 2021, remaining at the magazine as consulting editor.

As an editor, Wilmers has been closely associated with the work of a number of novelists and essayists, including Alan Bennett, John Lanchester, Jenny Diski, Blake Morrison, Alan Hollinghurst, Seamus Heaney, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes, Craig Raine, Colm Tóibín, Stefan Collini, James Wood, Linda Colley, Jacqueline Rose, Paul Foot, Tariq Ali and Edward Luttwak. Many of these were published prominently when at the beginnings of their careers.

Politically the review is not known for following a consistent party political line, although Wilmers described herself as being &quot;captivated by the left but not of it&quot;. Under her editorship the review&#x27;s treatment of political matters sometimes attracted controversy. In 2006, an article by academics John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt was criticised in some quarters for its claim that the foreign policy of the United States was in the grip of an &quot;Israel lobby&quot;. Wilmers has herself said, &quot;I&#x27;m unambiguously hostile to Israel because it&#x27;s a mendacious state&quot;, an assessment which has not gone unchallenged. An article by the Cambridge historian Mary Beard, published after the events of September 11, 2001, attracted some attention for suggesting that &quot;America had it coming&quot;, and when David Marquand, the political historian and principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, submitted a review praising Tony Blair&#x27;s handling of the post-11 September period as &quot;impeccable&quot;, Wilmers replied saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t square it with my conscience to praise so wholeheartedly Blair&#x27;s conduct&quot; and pulled the piece. Marquand announced that he was &quot;utterly shocked&quot;.

==Honours==
A book of tributes to Wilmers, &quot;Bad Character&quot;, was published privately in June 2008 and distributed as a limited edition.

In 2017 she was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, as well as being honoured with their Benson Medal.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Wilmers married film director Stephen Frears, with whom she had two sons, Sam and Will. They lived on Gloucester Crescent in Camden Town. Frears left Wilmers while she was pregnant with their second son Will in the early 1970s, and the couple divorced. Nina Stibbe, the live-in nanny that Wilmers hired in the early 1980s, wrote letters home that described the North London &quot;literati&quot; life; these were compiled, published, and adapted into the 2016 TV series &quot;Love, Nina&quot;.

<text>&quot;Rising&quot; is the pilot episode for season one of the military science fiction television series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, a Canadian-American spin off series of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. The episode was written by executive producers Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper, and directed by Martin Wood. The episode was the strongest episode of the whole series on Nielsen household ratings. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide.

&quot;Rising&quot; is about the establishment of the Atlantis expedition, it follows Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) and Colonel Marshall Sumner (Robert Patrick) and their mission to the Pegasus Galaxy in part one. The second part is about the awakening of the Wraith and freeing prisoners of war from them. The pilot has various guest stars from &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; as for example Jack O&#x27;Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and Siler (Dan Shea) among others.

== Plot ==
=== Part 1 ===
The technologically advanced Ancient race from &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; series voyaged to the Pegasus Galaxy from Earth via a colossal starship to spread new life. The city of Atlantis served as a maneuvering station as well as a base of operations. Their mission was unsuccessful and they met a terrible new enemy called the Wraith, the Ancients lost the war with the Wraith and after a long siege Atlantis was submerged under the ocean.

Discovering evidence of the Ancients journey to another galaxy, a large team of scientists and military personnel, led by diplomat Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) examine residual technology in an Antarctic outpost with hopes to travel to Atlantis, thereby discovering any knowledge left behind and unraveling the mystery of the abrupt disappearance of its citizens. With the assistance of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Jack O&#x27;Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) they are able to travel to Atlantis through the Stargate.

Using an Ancient power resource known as the Zero Point Module (ZPM) to supply the energy essential for the unusually extended wormhole, an assembly of volunteer representatives from many different countries joins the Atlantis expedition under the command of Colonel Marshall Sumner (Robert Patrick) of the United States Marine Corps. Shortly after crossing, Dr. Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) determines that because of the immediate depletion of power due to their arrival, the shield protecting the city from the ocean water, will imminently collapse. Without enough energy to return to Earth, a squadron including Colonel Sumner, Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), and Lieutenant Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Francks) travels to a random planet for help. The local villagers, led by Teyla Emmagan (Rachel Luttrell), are permitted to breed for generations before being systematically harvested by the Wraith. They assist the strangers, but as Colonel Sumner arranges an exploration of a vacant Ancient settlement, three Wraith starships travel through the Athosian Stargate to begin herding the planet’s human inhabitants.

=== Part 2 ===
The Wraith starships head toward the village and start attacking. The military personnel start attacking the starships, but are eventually outmaneuvered by the Wraith. Back in Atlantis the shield is getting weaker and the remaining personnel there receive immediate orders to evacuate. Before they are able to press the gate address John Sheppard and the Athosian villagers come through the Stargate. When the shield fails, rather than taking on water, the city rises to the ocean surface. The captured military personnel and Athosian villagers wake up in a Wraith cell, three Wraith start taking out prisoners from the cell, one at the time. After tracking where the Wraith hideout is, Rodney McKay reveals to Sheppard that they can use one of the Ancient spaceships, dubbed &quot;Puddle Jumper&quot; by Sheppard, to get there. In the meantime, Carson Beckett shows Elizabeth Weir what he found out about the Wraith DNA.

Weir authorizes the rescue mission led by Sheppard, and he assembles a team together with Aiden Ford, to go through the Stargate. After leaving the Spacegate (a Stargate placed in Space, or in Orbit around a planet) on the other side, they eventually find the location of the Wraith base on the planet below. Meanwhile, Marshall Sumner is confronted by a Wraith woman (The Keeper). She tells him about their race and then uses her telepathic abilities to find out about Earth which she hopes to use as a new feeding ground for the Wraith. In the meantime Sheppard and Ford infiltrate the Wraith base and trying to locate the survivors from the Wraith attack. They split up, and Sheppard finds Sumner and the Keeper. The Keeper begins to feed on Sumner, and Sheppard shoots him, after witnessing his suffering. After Ford locates and saves the others survivors, he saves Sheppard from being fed upon by the Keeper. Sheppard kills her, but she tells him with her dying breath, that he has awoken them all. Sheppard and Ford witness the Wraith awakening from their hibernation pods, and decide to leave.

The remaining soldiers, protecting the Jumper outside the base are attacked by Wraith Darts. The team is able to escape the planet with the Jumper, but is held up by Wraith Darts blockading the Spacegate. Sheppard eventually manages to maneuver the Jumper to the gate. Back in Atlantis Sheppard, Ford and Weir talk about the situation with the Wraith and Sheppard apologizes because he hasn&#x27;t made them many friends. However, Weir then shows him the Athosians, and Teyla Emmagan agrees with her, since they will help them find more friends. While the expedition celebrates their arrival in Atlantis, Weir asks Sheppard which members he wants in his team, since they have to go out there to fight the Wraith.

== Production ==

The pilot episode, &quot;Rising (Parts 1 and 2)&quot; was written by Robert C. Cooper and Brad Wright, and directed by Martin Wood. The Pemberton Glacier in British Columbia doubles for Antarctica during the opening flying sequence. The Antarctic scenes in the start of the episode was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The budget for the two-part episode was estimated around $5 million US dollars. Rodney McKay was actually supposed to be African-Canadian under the name Dr. Benjamin Ingram, but when the producers hired Rainbow Sun Francks to the play the young tactical genius, they approached David Hewlett to audition for the role. The producers eventually came to a solution where Ingram would be replaced by McKay from the former &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; series. The character Teyla Emmagan was originally named &quot;Mikala&quot; in the early drafts of the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; script. At the end of February, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) announced the inclusion of Robert Patrick&#x27;s character Marshall Sumner. The official announcement said that he would only be featured in part one, but was later extended to both parts one and two. In January 2004 the &quot;Stargate&quot; producers announced including Jack O&#x27;Neill (portrayed by Richard Dean Anderson) and Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) in the two-hour premiere pilot episode to make it easier for fans to relate to.

&quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; was supposed to be set on present day Earth, after &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was canceled. This cancelation of SG-1 didn&#x27;t happen and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; was released while &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was still airing, so the story arc was set in a new galaxy under the name, Pegasus. The story was set in another galaxy so the two running series would not collide with each other and to stop plot interferences.

== Reception ==

&quot;Rising&quot; is &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; strongest episode of the series, with a 3.2 on the Nielsen ratings.
The episode was the most watched episode ever broadcast by Sci Fi Channel gathering over 4 million viewers in the United States according to &quot;Variety&quot; in 2004, but was beaten by &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; in 2009. In the United Kingdom, it was viewed by 1.28 million people, placing it first in the most viewed shows in Sky One for the week. The two-part pilot episode was released on DVD after its initial broadcast on TV. The pilot episode was awarded a Gemini Award in the category Best Visual Effects. The episode was also nominated for an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series&quot;, a Leo Award for &quot;Best Production Design in a Dramatic Series&quot;, and a Visual Effects Society Award for &quot;Outstanding Visual Effects in a Broadcast Series&quot;. The original and first release date of &quot;Rising (Part 1)&quot; was on July 16, 2004 and was released internationally on September 19, 2005. &quot;Rising (Part 2)&quot; was released at the same time as Part 1 in the United States, but was released internationally on September 26, 2006.

David Nusair from &quot;Reel Film Reviews&quot; said &quot;as a pilot episode, there&#x27;s no denying that &quot;Rising&quot; gets the job done.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; reviewer Filip Vukcevic gave the episode, 6 out of 10 and said &quot;while this pilot does have promise, it doesn&#x27;t appear to deliver anything but average sci-fi fare. Hopefully the series itself has more spice.&quot; Dan Heaton from &quot;Digitally Obsessed&quot; said &quot;Rising provides a strong introduction to an original series that retains the positive aspects of its predecessor but does not simply copy its success,&quot; and gave the episode an A. Taylor Brown when reviewing the Rising (Part 1) from &quot;GateWorld&quot; said &quot;as a pilot episode, &quot;Rising&quot; gives viewers a lot of hope for the series to come,&quot; the episode was given 4 out of 5 stars. Virginia Heffernan from &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the episode &quot;Dull&quot; and further commented that it was a &quot;relic of our own unenlightened time,&quot; but said that the show could win fans with its &quot;Lavish special effects&quot;.

<text>Rice pudding is a dish made from rice mixed with water or milk and commonly other ingredients such as sweeteners, spices, flavourings and sometimes eggs.

Variants are used for either desserts or dinners. When used as a dessert, it is commonly combined with a sweetener such as sugar. Such desserts are found on many continents, especially Asia, where rice is a staple. Some variants are thickened only with the rice starch, while others include eggs, making them a kind of custard.

==Rice pudding around the world==
Rice puddings are found in nearly every area of the world. Recipes can greatly vary even within a single country. The dessert can be boiled or baked. Different types of pudding vary depending on preparation methods and the selected ingredients. The following ingredients are usually found in rice puddings:
* rice; white rice (usually short-grain, but can also be long-grain, broken rice, basmati, or jasmine rice), brown rice, or black rice
* milk (whole milk, plant milk, cream, or evaporated)
* spices (cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, or others)
* flavorings and toppings (vanilla, orange, lemon, rose water; pistachio, almond, cashew, raisin, walnut, or others)
* sweetener (sugar, brown sugar, honey, sweetened condensed milk, dates, fruit or syrups)
* eggs (sometimes)

===Europe===
====Britain and Ireland====
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, rice pudding is a traditional dessert typically made with high-starch short-grained rice sold as &quot;pudding rice&quot;.

The earliest rice pudding recipes were called &quot;whitepot&quot; and date from the Tudor period. Rice pudding is traditionally made with pudding rice, milk, cream and sugar and is sometimes flavoured with vanilla, nutmeg, jam and/or cinnamon. It can be made in two ways: in a saucepan or by baking in the oven.

It can be made by gently simmering the milk and rice in a saucepan until tender, and then the sugar is carefully mixed in. Finally, the cream is mixed in, and it can either be left to cool and served at room temperature, or heated and served hot. It should have a very creamy consistency.
When made in the oven, the pudding rice is placed into a baking dish, and the milk, cream and sugar are mixed in. The dish is then placed in the oven and baked at a low temperature for a few hours, until the rice is tender and the pudding has a creamy consistency. While cooking, the pudding may develop a thick crust, which adds a distinct texture. It is traditional to sprinkle the top with finely grated nutmeg before baking. Using evaporated milk (9% milk fat) instead of whole milk enriches the result and intensifies the caramelised flavour.

An alternative recipe frequently used in the north of England uses butter instead of cream, adds a small pinch of salt, and requires the pudding mixture to stand for an hour or so prior to being cooked. Such puddings tend to set firmly when cooled, enabling slices to be cut and eaten like cake. If eaten hot, the pudding is traditionally served with cream poured on top in wealthy households, and with full fat milk where cream was not available. A spoonful of sweet jam or conserve is also a very popular topping for the pudding. Clotted cream is often used in the West Country.

A specific type of rice is available and widely used for rice pudding, called pudding rice. Similar to Arborio rice, its grain is round and short, and when cooked produces a creamier consistency than savoury rice. However, other short grained rice can be used as a substitute.

Ready-made, pre-cooked rice pudding is widely available in supermarkets and corner shops, either chilled in pots or ambient in tin cans, which has a long shelf life. A popular brand is Ambrosia. Some brands are made with skimmed (fat free) milk.

In Finland, Christmas rice porridge is sometimes eaten with a kissel or compote made of dried prunes.

A particular Christmas tradition often associated with rice pudding or porridge is hiding a whole almond in the porridge. In Sweden and Finland, popular belief has it that the one who eats the almond will be in luck the following year. In Norway, Denmark, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, the one who finds it will get the almond present as a prize. In Denmark and the Faroe Islands, the almond tradition is usually done with served as dessert at (Christmas lunch) or on Christmas Eve.

<doc id="849874" wikidata="Q950591" url="?curid=849874" title="Scotoma">
<text>A scotoma is an area of partial alteration in the field of vision consisting of a partially diminished or entirely degenerated visual acuity that is surrounded by a field of normal – or relatively well-preserved – vision.

Every normal mammalian eye has a scotoma in its field of vision, usually termed its blind spot. This is a location with no photoreceptor cells, where the retinal ganglion cell axons that compose the optic nerve exit the retina. This location is called the optic disc. There is no direct conscious awareness of visual scotomas. They are simply regions of reduced information within the visual field. Rather than recognizing an incomplete image, patients with scotomas report that things &quot;disappear&quot; on them.

The presence of the blind spot scotoma can be demonstrated subjectively by covering one eye, carefully holding fixation with the open eye, and placing an object (such as one&#x27;s thumb) in the lateral and horizontal visual field, about 15 degrees from fixation. The size of the monocular scotoma is 5×7 degrees of visual angle.

A scotoma can be a symptom of damage to any part of the visual system, such as retinal damage from exposure to high-powered lasers, macular degeneration, and brain damage.

The term &quot;scotoma&quot; is also used metaphorically in several fields. The common theme of all the figurative senses is of a gap not in visual function but in the mind&#x27;s perception, cognition, or world view. The term is .

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptom-producing, or pathological, scotomata may be due to a wide range of disease processes, affecting any part of the visual system, including the retina (in particular its most sensitive portion, the macula), the optic nerve and even the visual cortex. A pathological scotoma may involve any part of the visual field and may be of any shape or size. A scotoma may include and enlarge the normal blind spot. Even a small scotoma that happens to affect central or macular vision will produce a severe visual disability, whereas a large scotoma in the more peripheral part of a visual field may go unnoticed by the bearer because of the normal reduced optical resolution in the peripheral visual field.

==Causes==
Common causes of scotomas include demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis (retrobulbar neuritis), damage to nerve fiber layer in the retina (seen as cotton wool spots) due to hypertension, toxic substances such as methyl alcohol, ethambutol and quinine, nutritional deficiencies, vascular blockages either in the retina or in the optic nerve, stroke or other brain injury, and macular degeneration, often associated with aging. Scintillating scotoma is a common visual aura in migraine. Less common, but important because they are sometimes reversible or curable by surgery, are scotomata due to tumors such as those arising from the pituitary gland, which may compress the optic nerve or interfere with its blood supply.

Rarely, scotomata are . One important variety of bilateral scotoma may occur when a pituitary tumour begins to compress the optic chiasm (as distinct from a single optic nerve) and produces a bitemporal paracentral scotoma, and later, when the tumor enlarges, the scotomas extend out to the periphery to cause the characteristic bitemporal hemianopsia. This type of visual-field defect tends to be obvious to the person experiencing it but often evades early objective diagnosis, as it is more difficult to detect by cursory clinical examination than the classical or textbook bitemporal peripheral hemianopia and may even elude sophisticated electronic modes of visual-field assessment.

In a pregnant woman, scotomata can present as a symptom of severe pre-eclampsia, a form of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Similarly, scotomata may develop as a result of the increased intracranial pressure that occurs in malignant hypertension.

The scotoma is also caused by the aminoglycoside antibiotics mainly by streptomycin.

==Terminology==
Beyond its literal sense concerning the visual system, the term &quot;scotoma&quot; is also used metaphorically in several fields, including neurology, neuropsychology, psychology, philosophy, and politics. The common theme of all the figurative senses is of a gap not in visual function but in the mind&#x27;s perception, cognition, or world view. Their concrete connection to the literal sense, however, is by the connection between the nervous system and the mind, via the chain of links from sensory input, to nerve conduction, to the brain, to perception (the processing and interpreting of that input) via the brain-mind correlation, to psychological function. Thus there is not only (or not necessarily) a visual inability to see an aspect of reality but also (or instead) a mental inability to conceive even the possibility of seeing that aspect, due to a cognitive that lacks any provision for it.

At the most level, there is &quot;neuropsychological scotoma&quot;. One example is the hemispatial neglect that is sometimes experienced by people who have had strokes. Another type is the phenomenon of reverse or negative phantom limb, in which nerve injuries to the limbs, such as trauma in which a limb&#x27;s nerves are severed but the limb is spared from amputation, can affect the mind&#x27;s body schema in such a way that an existing limb seems to its owner like it should not exist, and its presence thus seems uncanny. Neurologist Oliver Sacks, who experienced a reverse phantom leg that later resolved, considered it a form of spatial neglect in the body schema analogous to hemispatial neglect in that the mind could not conceive of the leg as self because it could not conceive that there was any space for the leg to exist in. Sacks and others agreed that the leg thus seemed like someone else&#x27;s leg, including sometimes a cadaverous one, which was part of the reason for the dysphoria but not the sole explanation. Even for people who intellectually understood that the leg or hand was supposed to be theirs simply could not believe it emotionally and could not completely reconcile reality with schema, prompting great unease. Given how hard this is to comprehend for a person who has not experienced it, people recently experiencing it for the first time consider it both uncanny and ineffable (as Sacks self-reported and found in others). Sacks also explored the regular type of phantom limb (a positive phantom), which does not produce a neuropsychological scotoma but shares with reverse phantoms the trait that the body schema resists revision despite a person&#x27;s perfect intellectual awareness and acceptance of the current physical reality (that is, that the amputated limb is gone or that the spared limb is still present). This suggests that aspects of schema in the mind (body schema, world schema) have neurologic bases that cannot be revised by mere intellectual understanding—at least not quickly. Sacks does explore the topic of how people adapt to phantoms over the years and how positive phantom limbs often gradually foreshorten and sometimes disappear; but some remain for the rest of life.

 At a higher level of abstraction are what have been called &quot;&quot;, in which a person&#x27;s self-perception of his or her own personality is judged by others to have a gap in perceptive ability. Thus, in psychology, &quot;scotoma&quot; can refer to a person&#x27;s inability to perceive personality traits in themselves that are obvious to others. And at the highest abstraction level are what have been called &quot;intellectual scotomas&quot;, in which a person cannot perceive distortions in their world view that are obvious to others. Thus, in philosophy or politics, a person&#x27;s thoughts or beliefs might be shaped by an inability to appreciate aspects of social interaction or institutional structure.

<text>Andrew &quot;Freddie&quot; Flintoff (born 6 December 1977), is an English television and radio presenter and former international cricketer. Flintoff played all forms of the game and was one of the sport&#x27;s leading all-rounders, a fast bowler, middle-order batsman and slip fielder. He was consistently rated by the ICC as being among the top international all-rounders in both ODI and Test cricket.

Following his debut in 1998, Flintoff became an integral player for England and was England&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Series&quot; in the 2005 Ashes. He later served as both captain and vice-captain of the team. He retired from Test cricket at the end of the 2009 Ashes series and from other forms of the game in 2010. He then had one professional boxing fight on 30 November 2012 in Manchester, beating American Richard Dawson on a points decision. In 2014, Flintoff came out of retirement to play Twenty20 cricket for Lancashire, before being signed by Brisbane Heat to play in the Australian Big Bash League for the 2014–15 season.

Since his retirement, Flintoff has been involved with numerous projects, including designing his own fashion range and becoming the face of clothing brand Jacamo, winning the first series of the Australian version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; and being part of Sky One&#x27;s sports-based comedy panel show &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;. Flintoff became a presenter of the BBC One car show &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2019, remaining with the programme until he sustained injuries resulting from an accident during filming in late 2022.

==Early life==
Flintoff&#x27;s father, Colin, was a plumber and factory maintenance worker and the captain of Dutton Forshaw second XI cricket team. Flintoff attended Greenlands Community Primary School and Ribbleton Hall High School (subsequently renamed City of Preston High School). His first trip abroad at age 14 was to Argentina.

During his school days he acquired the nickname &quot;Freddie&quot; due to his surname resembling that of the cartoon character Fred Flintstone.

At City of Preston High School, he passed nine GCSEs, but he did not want to stay in education and left school at 16. As a boy, he played cricket for the Lancashire Schools under-11s and under-15s teams and he was also a keen chess player. He then played for two and a half years in the England under-19 cricket team.

==Professional career==
===Early years: criticism, injury and fitness troubles===
Flintoff was captain of the England Under-19 team for their &quot;Test&quot; match tour to Pakistan in 1996/7 and at home against Zimbabwe in 1997. He made his Test match debut for England in 1998 against South Africa at Trent Bridge, in a match remembered for its second-innings duel between Mike Atherton and Allan Donald; in a precursor to their subsequent rivalry, Flintoff and Jacques Kallis exchanged wickets. Nonetheless, his struggle to make the grade at county level continued, he found form only intermittently, though often explosively when he did so.

In 2000, he hit 135 not out in the quarterfinals of the Natwest Trophy against Surrey, which David Gower described as &quot;the most awesome innings we are ever going to see on a cricket field&quot;. In the same year England&#x27;s management made clear they were unhappy with his fitness and weight, Flintoff responded to his critics with 42 not out in a one-day game against Zimbabwe on his home ground of Old Trafford, forming an explosive second-wicket stand with Graeme Hick; as he collected the Man of the Match award he remarked his performance was &quot;not bad for a fat lad&quot;.

Although he lost his England place during 2001, he remodelled his bowling action and gained a place on the 2001–02 tour to India. Though he hit possibly his worst international batting form during the Test series, frustrating him to the point that he broke down in tears in the dressing room at one stage, he later saw the tour as a turning point in his career, specifically the crucial final one-day match. Entrusted with bowling the final over with India needing 11 to win, he ran out Anil Kumble and bowled Javagal Srinath with successive balls to win the match, taking off his shirt in celebration, which was mimicked by Sourav Ganguly in a later match.

===Improved consistency, step-up to key international player===
In 2002, Flintoff scored his maiden Test century against New Zealand. By 2003, a newer, fitter Flintoff started to justify the comparisons with Botham. Up to the end of 2002, he had averaged just 19 with the bat and 47 with the ball; from 2003 to the end of the 2005 Ashes series, the corresponding figures were 43 and 28. In the summer of 2003 he scored a century and three fifties in the five-Test series against South Africa at home. He continued to play well on the tour of the West Indies in March and April 2004, taking five wickets in the Test in Barbados and scoring a century in Antigua. In early 2004 he was named as a &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketer of the Year.

Although injury prevented him from bowling, he was called into the England squad for the 2004 NatWest One Day International (ODI) Series against New Zealand and the West Indies as a specialist batsman, scoring two consecutive centuries in the series and hitting seven sixes in one innings.

He matched this haul in the Second Test against the West Indies at Edgbaston in July, hitting a first-class best figure of 167. During this innings, watched by a crowd of 20,000, Flintoff hit a six into the top tier of the Ryder Stand. A man stood to claim the catch and dropped it – it was Flintoff&#x27;s father. Over the course of England&#x27;s record-breaking summer, he hit a half-century in all seven victorious Tests against New Zealand and the West Indies. On returning to the one-day game as an all-rounder in September he fell agonisingly short of a third one-day century, caught on 99 against India, though he went on to hit a further century in the ICC Champions Trophy 2004 pool match against Sri Lanka two weeks later.

At the end of the season he was named as the inaugural winner of the ICC Award for one-day player of the year and the Professional Cricketers&#x27; Association player of the year. He also became a father when his fiancée Rachael Wools gave birth on 6 September. They now have a second child who was born during the series in India in 2006. Flintoff briefly returned home from the tour to see his son for the first time.

===2005: Ashes winner===

Following the Test series in South Africa in December 2004 and January 2005, Flintoff flew home for surgery on his left ankle, leading to worries he might not regain fitness in time for The Ashes. In fact, following a rehabilitation programme of swimming and hill-walking, he recovered ahead of schedule and was able to return to action for Lancashire in April.

In the Second Test against Australia at Edgbaston in August 2005, he broke Ian Botham&#x27;s 1981 record of six sixes in an Ashes Test Match with five in the first innings and a further four in the second innings; he scored 141 runs in total. In the same game he took a total of seven wickets (across both innings), including the wickets of Langer and Ponting in his first over in Australia&#x27;s run-chase. He managed all this despite a shoulder injury early in the second innings. England won the game by just two runs and saved their hopes of regaining the Ashes. Flintoff was named &#x27;Man of the Match&#x27; and captain Michael Vaughan subsequently dubbed the match &quot;Fred&#x27;s Test&quot; in honour of his achievement.

Flintoff scored a century during England&#x27;s crucial win at Trent Bridge. He took five wickets on the fourth day of the final Test match, enabling England to go off for bad light and helping them eventually to secure a draw and regain the Ashes.

For his achievements throughout the 2005 Ashes series, he was named as &quot;Man of the Series&quot; by Australian coach, John Buchanan. His achievement also won him the inaugural Compton-Miller Medal. He was also awarded the Freedom of the City of Preston.

In October 2005, Flintoff shared the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for the ICC player of the year award with Jacques Kallis of South Africa. In December 2005, Flintoff was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2005, the first cricketer since Botham in 1981. In the New Year&#x27;s Honours List for 2006, Flintoff was appointed an MBE for his role in the successful Ashes side. In January 2006, Flintoff was presented with the Freedom of the City award for Preston, Lancashire. The award was presented to Flintoff by the mayor of Preston. Other recipients of the award include Sir Tom Finney and Nick Park.

===England captaincy===

In February 2006 following England captain Michael Vaughan and vice-captain Marcus Trescothick becoming unavailable for the first Test match against India, Flintoff was named captain of the England team and subsequently announced that he would be staying in India for the entire Test series, although he and his wife were expecting their second child. His wife gave birth to a son, Corey, shortly before the second Test on 9 March.

On the field, Flintoff was seen as a great success during the drawn series with India, with a 212-run victory in Mumbai. His contributions with both bat and ball ensured that he was named as the player of the series, with many commentators seeing Flintoff as someone who not only worked better under the responsibility but was also viewed as a great influence of an inexperienced side, which included many debutants, such as Alastair Cook, Owais Shah and Monty Panesar. Flintoff amassed four fifties in the series and took 11 wickets, on unfriendly surfaces for seamers. Flintoff continued to captain England during the seven ODIs in India, although he was rested for two matches. Sri Lanka toured in May and England drew the three-Test series 1–1. The series took a heavy toll on Flintoff physically as journalist David Hopps remarked:

A recurrence of his long-term ankle problem in the Test series meant Flintoff missed both the ODI series against Sri Lanka and the first Test against Pakistan. It was later announced in July that Flintoff&#x27;s rehabilitation had not been sufficient to quell the injury and that further surgery would be required. He was thus ruled out for the entire series against Pakistan. Despite injury concerns, Flintoff was later named for the ICC Champions Trophy, where he played as a specialist batsman, not as an all-rounder.

===2006–07 Ashes series===
After his previous stint as captain in the Test series against India, Flintoff returned as captain of the England team for the eagerly anticipated 2006-07 Ashes series in Australia. The series turned out to be a humiliating one for Flintoff, leading his side to five straight losses and thus losing the Ashes after having held them for the shortest time in history. In addition, he presided over England&#x27;s worst ever defeat in an Ashes series, equalling the 1921 whitewash at the hands of the Warwick Armstrong-led Australian team in the wake of World War I.
Flintoff&#x27;s own play in the 2006–07 series, both bowling and at the crease, was generally deemed disappointing. He made only two scores over 50 in the series, his best bowling figures being 4–99 in the first innings of the First Test in Brisbane, and he failed to take five wickets in a match. Flintoff played in only one first-class game in the lead up to the series. He was initially undone by Australia&#x27;s excellent seam bowling but his batting improved throughout the series as he got more match practice. A persistent ankle injury prevented Flintoff from bowling long spells at full pace and Australia&#x27;s batsmen took advantage of this. According to Nasser Hussain during the tour he also had three or four warnings for inappropriate behaviour and binge drinking, including arriving hung over for a training session.

Flintoff also captained England for several of the subsequent 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series One Day International matches. Michael Vaughan&#x27;s return from knee surgery was cut short by a hamstring injury and he was only able to play two matches, leaving Flintoff in charge for the remaining games. England qualified in the last game of eight group matches for the best-of-three finals against Australia, but reversed their poor form on tour with a 2–0 series win in the finals.

Flintoff contributed significantly with the ball in both matches, taking three wickets in the first match and allowing only 10 runs off five overs in the second as Australia chased a reduced total in a rain-hit match.

===2007 Cricket World Cup===
With Michael Vaughan returning from injury for the Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, Flintoff was replaced as captain but appointed England&#x27;s vice-captain.

In the opening match of the tournament against New Zealand, Flintoff was out first ball in England&#x27;s innings and, although conceding only 17 runs in eight overs, he failed to take a wicket. He did, however, take a one-handed catch at slip to dismiss Ross Taylor for a duck. On the evening of England&#x27;s defeat Flintoff, along with some other players and coaches from the England squad, indulged in some late night drinking in a night club, only two days before their vital match against Canada. In the early hours of the morning, he reportedly had to be rescued after falling off a pedalo – this quickly became known in the media as the &quot;Fredalo&quot; incident. Flintoff and the others involved were reprimanded and fined, with Flintoff being stripped of the vice-captaincy. In addition, he was suspended for the match against Canada. It was revealed by England coach Duncan Fletcher that Flintoff had had a number of previous warnings about his behaviour. Flintoff has since issued a public apology and later also clarified that he didn&#x27;t actually &quot;fall off&quot; a pedalo but rather failed in an attempt to board one.

Flintoff returned to the England team for the last group match against Kenya, taking two wickets. In the Super 8 matches, Flintoff often excelled with the ball but failed to recover his batting form. Against Ireland he took 4–43 and scored 43 runs; against Sri Lanka he took 3–35 but was out for 2 and against Australia he took 1–35 but was out for 4. In the next match against Bangladesh Flintoff took 1–38 in eight overs and scored 23 runs off 21 balls. Ultimately, he failed to influence an ailing English side and had a poor tournament. Michael Vaughan later commented that Flintoff&#x27;s pedalo antics had adversely affected team morale.

===2007–09: Injuries, comeback and retirement===
Flintoff returned for a couple of games with Lancashire, in preparation for the West Indies tour of England but he re-injured his ankle and was ruled out for the first Test which started on 17 May 2007. Having undergone another operation on the troublesome ankle, he missed the whole Test and one-day series against the West Indies, and he was also ruled out for the subsequent Test series with India. Following several games for Lancashire, Flintoff returned for England in the first of seven ODIs against India on 21 August 2007. He bowled seven overs and ended with figures of one for twelve in England&#x27;s 104-run victory. He hit an eventful nine runs during the second ODI; however, while fielding, he injured his knee and sat out England&#x27;s 42-run victory in the third ODI. He returned for the fourth ODI on 30 August. Flintoff missed England&#x27;s two narrow defeats to India in the fifth and sixth ODIs before taking 3–45 in the seventh, helping England to win the series four-three with a seven-wicket victory.

Flintoff&#x27;s ankle injury recurred during the end of the 2007 season. Although he played in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, he did not accompany the England squad to Sri Lanka, while a fourth operation made it highly unlikely that he would play again before the summer of 2008 and would miss both the Sri Lankan Test Series and the 2008 tour of New Zealand. Flintoff remained &quot;upbeat&quot; about his career, however.

Flintoff was back in action for Lancashire early in the 2008 season, but a side strain ruled him out of contention for the home series against New Zealand. After again returning to action in county cricket he was recalled to the England squad for the second Test against South Africa, where he missed the last 17 Tests prior. He took his 200th Test wicket in the Third Test, trapping Neil McKenzie lbw for 72. Flintoff bowled consistently against the South Africans, but South African coach Mickey Arthur felt that he was too defensive. His batting also began to show promise as he consistently made starts, before being moved back up to bat at six when Kevin Pietersen took over as captain. In the following one day series, Flintoff was an important player for England, leading Pietersen to describe him as &quot;a superstar&quot;. Flintoff scored 78 in both the first and the third matches – he was not required to bat in the second – as well as 31 not out off 12 balls in the fourth, whilst taking three wickets in the same match. This led many pundits to speculate that Flintoff might just be back to his best. He won Man of the Series in the ODI home series against South Africa, where England won four-nil: the last match was washed out. He was both the top run-scorer and the top wicket-taker of that series. Still, though, his want of consistency frustrated the pundits. &quot;Flintoff,&quot; wrote Peter Roebuck some time later, &quot;is a fine cricketer who has never quite worked out how he takes wickets or scores runs. Torn between hitting and playing, pounding and probing, he has performed below his highest capabilities.&quot;

On England&#x27;s tour of India, Flintoff started the series well. In the first warm-up match against the Mumbai Cricket Association, he scored exactly 100. It was his first century for England since the Fourth Test of the 2005 Ashes. His batting did not follow with similar successes in India and the West Indies, but his bowling remained strong, with a dozen wickets in the Caribbean at under 30 apiece, followed by a hat-trick in the final ODI series, becoming only the third English bowler ever to do so.

In February 2009, the Chennai Super Kings of the Indian Premier League bought Flintoff for US$1,550,000; US$600,000 above his base price of US$950,000. This made him the highest-ever-paid IPL player at the time, alongside compatriot Kevin Pietersen, surpassing Mahendra Singh Dhoni&#x27;s US$1,500,000. But Flintoff did not find success at the tournament, held in South Africa due to the Indian General Elections, as after a difficult first few matches he was sent home for surgery following another knee injury.


However, speculation over Flintoff&#x27;s form ahead of the much-awaited 2009 Ashes series died down as he took six wickets in his first match back for Lancashire and left &quot;several county batsmen...nursing bruised ribs and fingers&quot;. He also collected a half-century against Hampshire, although he was still yet to register a century in either domestic cricket or any form of the international game since that Trent Bridge instalment of the last home Ashes in 2005, which year also accounted for his most recent Test five-for. &quot;It&#x27;s always been an Australian trait to over-rate players who have done well against them (just ask VVS Laxman),&quot; wrote Lawrence Booth. &quot;But in the case of Andrew Flintoff, this phenomenon is getting so out of control you wonder whether Steve Waugh has returned to orchestrate a cunning mind-game. ... In any case, does anyone honestly think a player with his fitness record will make it through a five-Test series condensed into less than seven weeks?&quot; Flintoff did offer some hope with the willow in the Twenty20 Cup, however, hitting 93 off 41 balls for Lancashire against Derbyshire in June.

On 15 July 2009, Flintoff announced he would retire from Test cricket at the end of the 2009 Ashes Series. He said that &quot;Since 2005 I have just been plagued with injury so I&#x27;ve got the opportunity now to finish on a high by helping England to win the Ashes and it will give me great pleasure if I can play my last Test at the Oval and we can win the Ashes – it doesn&#x27;t get any bigger than that.&quot; He was man of the match in England&#x27;s victory at Lords in the Second Test Match, taking 5 wickets in the second innings after a fine display of fast bowling and achieving the rare feat of making both Lord&#x27;s Honours Boards. On 23 August 2009, England defeated Australia at The Oval to seal a 2–1 series win, with Flintoff notably running out the Australian captain Ricky Ponting, ensuring Flintoff ended his England career on a high.

On 16 September 2010, Flintoff retired from all forms of professional cricket, having consulted medical advisers. He continued to play recreationally for Penwortham Cricket Club alongside his brother Chris Flintoff.

===2014–present: Twenty20 comeback and second retirement===
Flintoff came out of retirement in May 2014, returning to Lancashire to play Twenty20 only. He featured in the final of the competition, dismissing Ian Bell with the ball and hitting two sixes in the penultimate over as Lancashire fell just short against Birmingham Bears. After this season he was signed by the Brisbane Heat in the Australian Big Bash League for the 2014–15 season. Flintoff disappointed on the field, ending the season with a high score of 46, with only one other score in double figures (15), along with three wickets at an average of 45.33.

In September 2024, Flintoff was announced as the new head coach of the England Lions cricket team for upcoming tours to South Africa, Australia and home matches against India A cricket team and Zimbabwe.

<doc id="849891" wikidata="Q17144691" url="?curid=849891" title="NLGI consistency number">
<text>The NLGI consistency number or NLGI grade expresses a measure of the relative hardness of a grease used for lubrication, as specified by the &quot;standard classification of lubricating grease&quot; established by the National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI). Reproduced in standards 
 &quot;(“standard classification and specification of automotive service greases”)&quot; and &quot;(“automotive lubricating greases”)&quot;, NLGI&#x27;s classification is widely used. The NLGI consistency number is also a component of the code specified in standard &quot;“lubricants, industrial oils and related products (class L) — classification — part 9: family X (greases)”&quot;.

The NLGI consistency number alone is not sufficient for specifying the grease required by a particular application. However, it complements other classifications (such as and ). Besides consistency, other properties (such as structural and mechanical stability, apparent viscosity, resistance to oxidation, etc.) can be tested to determine the suitability of a grease to a specific application.

==Test method==

NLGI&#x27;s classification defines nine grades, each associated to a range of ASTM worked penetration values, measured using the test defined by standard &quot;“cone penetration of lubricating grease”&quot;. This involves two test apparatus. The first apparatus consists of a closed container and a piston-like plunger. The face of the plunger is perforated to allow grease to flow from one side of the plunger to another as the plunger is worked up and down. The test grease is inserted into the container and the plunger is stroked while the test apparatus and grease are maintained at a temperature of .

Once worked, the grease is placed in a penetration test apparatus. This apparatus consists of a container, a specially-configured cone and a dial indicator. The container is filled with the grease and the top surface of the grease is smoothed over. The cone is placed so that its tip just touches the grease surface and the dial indicator is set to zero at this position. When the test starts, the weight of the cone will cause it to penetrate into the grease. After a specific time interval the depth of penetration is measured.

==Classification==

The following table shows the NLGI classification and compares each grade with household products of similar consistency. 
Common greases are in the range 1 through 3. Those with a NLGI No. of 000 to 1 are used in low viscosity applications. Examples include enclosed gear drives operating at low speeds and open gearing. Grades 0, 1 and 2 are used in highly loaded gearing. Grades 1 through 4 are often used in rolling contact bearings. Greases with a higher number are firmer, tend to stay in place and are a good choice when leakage is a concern.

<text>Ari&#x27;i-Otare Terii-maeva-rua III [[Pōmare Dynasty|Pomare]] (28 May 1871 – 19 November 1932) was the last Queen of the Tahitian island of Bora Bora from 1873 to 1895.

The second daughter of Prince Tamatoa-a-tu (Tamatoa V), King of Raiātea and Tahaa and Princess Moe-a-Mai, Arii-Otare became the Queen of Bora Bora on the death of her aunt Princess Teriimaevarua II, Queen of Bora Bora. She married Prince Teri&#x27;i Hinoi-a-tua Pomare, chief of Hitia&#x27;a in Bora Bora on 9 January 1884 and was divorced in 1887. Ari&#x27;i-&#x27;Otare produced no children of her own. She adopted her two younger step daughters; Princess Rehu-rehu Tuheiava and Princess Itia Tuheiava. She also adopted and raised her biological nephew Moeterauri &quot;Bimbo&quot; Tetua who was born on 14 September 1916.

Bora Bora was annexed by the French on 17 April 1888, but royal power remained in effect until 1895, when Teriimaevarua III was replaced by a French vice-resident. She remained the head of the royal house of Bora Bora until her death.

<text>Soyuz T-8 was a crewed mission to the Salyut 7 Soviet space station in 1983. Shortly into the mission, the spacecraft failed to dock with the space station due to an incident involving an antenna being torn off the craft by the protective launch shroud. After a fuel-consuming attempt made in darkness for an optical rendezvous with Salyut 7 resulted in an abort in order to avoid collision, it was decided to de-orbit T-8 two days into the mission in order to ensure that the spacecraft had a sufficient amount of propellant for the de-orbit maneuver. After de-orbiting, landing of the craft occurred normally.

==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 6850 kg
*Perigee: 200 km
*Apogee: 230 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 88.6 minutes

==Mission highlights==

Soyuz T-8 failed to dock with Salyut 7 due to problems with the capsule&#x27;s automated docking system. It was the first failure to dock at a space station since Soyuz 33 in 1979.

Once in orbit, the Soyuz rendezvous radar antenna boom failed to deploy properly. Several attitude control maneuvers at high rates failed to swing the boom out. The postflight inquiry later discovered that the antenna had been torn off when the Soyuz payload shroud separated. However, during the flight, the crew believed that the boom was still attached to the spacecraft&#x27;s orbital module and that it had merely not locked into place. Accordingly, they shook the spacecraft using its attitude thrusters in an effort to rock it forward so it could lock. 

With FCC permission, the crew attempted a rendezvous using only an optical sight and ground radar inputs for guidance. During the final approach, which was made in darkness, Titov believed that the closing speed was too great. He attempted a braking maneuver but felt that the two spacecraft were still closing too fast. He aborted the rendezvous to avoid a crash, and no further attempts were made. The abortive docking attempts consumed much propellant. To ensure that enough would remain to permit deorbit, the cosmonauts shut down the attitude control system and put Soyuz T-8 into a spin-stabilized mode of the type used by Soyuz Ferries in the early 1970s. The three men returned to Earth after a flight lasting just 2 days, 17 minutes, 48 seconds, and the landing proceeded normally.

<doc id="849905" wikidata="Q1054671" url="?curid=849905" title="Golf club">
<text>A golf club is a club used to hit a golf ball in a game of golf. Each club is composed of a shaft with a grip and a club head. Woods are mainly used for long-distance fairway or tee shots; irons, the most versatile class, are used for a variety of shots; hybrids that combine design elements of woods and irons are becoming increasingly popular; putters are used mainly on the green to roll the ball into the hole. A set of clubs is limited by the rules of golf to a maximum of 14 golf clubs, and while there are traditional combinations sold at retail as matched sets, players are free to use any combination of legal clubs.

The most significant difference between clubs of the same type is &quot;loft&quot;, or the angle between the club&#x27;s face and the vertical plane. It is loft that is the primary determinant of the ascending trajectory of the golf ball, with the tangential angle of the club head&#x27;s swing arc at impact being a secondary and relatively minor consideration (though these small changes in swing angle can nevertheless have a significant influence on launch angle when using low-lofted clubs). The impact of the club compresses the ball, while grooves on the club face give the ball backspin. Together, the compression and backspin create lift. The majority of woods and irons are labeled with a number; higher numbers usually indicate shorter shafts and higher lofts, which give the ball a higher and shorter trajectory.

== Club types==
=== Wood ===
&quot;Woods&quot; are long-distance clubs, meant to drive the ball a great distance down the fairway towards the hole. They generally have a large head and a long shaft for maximum club speed. Historically, woods were made from persimmon wood, although some manufacturers—notably Ping—developed laminated woods. In 1979, TaylorMade Golf introduced the first wood made of steel. Even more recently, manufacturers have started using materials such as carbon fiber, titanium, or scandium. Although most &quot;woods&quot; in golf are constructed from various metals, the term &quot;woods&quot; persists to characterize their general shape and intended use on the golf course. Contemporary woods commonly feature a graphite shaft paired with a predominantly hollow head made of titanium, composite materials, or steel. This design emphasizes light weight, enabling faster club-head speeds. Woods, being the longest and most powerful clubs, typically consist of three to four options in a set. They are primarily utilized from the tee box and, on longer holes, may be employed for the second or even third shot. The largest wood, often referred to as the driver or one wood, is frequently crafted from hollow titanium and incorporates feather-light shafts. The length of the woods has been increasing in recent decades, and a typical driver with a graphite shaft is now long. The woods may also have very large heads, up to in volume (the maximum allowed by the USGA in sanctioned events; drivers with even larger club-head volumes are available for long-drive competitions and informal games). The shafts range from senior to extra-stiff depending upon each player&#x27;s preference.

=== Iron ===
&quot;Irons&quot; are clubs with a solid, all-metal head featuring a flat angled face, and a shorter shaft and more upright lie angle than a wood, for ease of access. Irons are designed for a variety of shots from all over the course, from the tee box on short or dog-legged holes, to the fairway or rough on approach to the green, to tricky situations like punching through or lobbing over trees, getting out of hazards, or hitting from tight lies requiring a compact swing. Most of the irons have a number from 1 to 9 (the numbers in most common use are from 3 to 9), corresponding to their relative loft angle within a matched set. Irons are typically grouped according to their intended distance (which also roughly corresponds to their shaft length and thus their difficulty to hit the ball); in the numbered irons, there are long irons (2–4), medium irons (5–7), and short irons (8–9), with progressively higher loft angles, shorter shafts, and heavier club heads.

As with woods, &quot;irons&quot; get their name because they were originally made from forged iron. Modern irons are investment-cast out of steel alloys, which allows for better-engineered &quot;cavity-back&quot; designs that have lower centers of mass and higher moments of inertia, making the club easier to hit and giving better distance than older forged &quot;muscle-back&quot; designs. Forged irons with less perimeter weighting are still seen, especially in sets targeting low-handicap and scratch golfers, because this less forgiving design allows a skilled golfer to intentionally hit a curved shot (a &quot;fade&quot; or &quot;draw&quot;), to follow the contour of the fairway or &quot;bend&quot; a shot around an obstacle.

==== Wedge ====
&quot;Wedges&quot; are a subclass of irons with greater loft than the numbered irons (generally starting at 47°–48° of loft, above the 9-irons of 44°–45°), and other features such as high-mass club heads and wide soles that allow for easier use in tricky lies. Wedges are used for a variety of short-distance, high-altitude, high-accuracy &quot;utility&quot; shots, such as hitting the ball onto the green (&quot;approach&quot; shots), placing the ball accurately on the fairway for a better shot at the green (&quot;lay-up&quot; shots), or hitting the ball out of hazards or rough onto the green (chipping). There are five main types of wedges, with lofts ranging from 45° to 64°: pitching wedge (PW, 48–50°), gap wedge (GW, also &quot;approach&quot;, &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;utility&quot;, or &quot;dual&quot; wedge, typically 52–54°), sand wedge (SW, 55–56°), lob wedge (LW, 58°–60°), and ultra lob wedge (sometimes called the &quot;flop wedge&quot; or FW, 64°–68°).

=== Hybrid ===
&quot;Hybrids&quot; are a cross between a wood and an iron, giving these clubs the wood&#x27;s long distance and higher launch, with the iron&#x27;s familiar swing. The club head of a hybrid has a wood-inspired, slightly convex face, and is typically hollow like modern metal woods to allow for high impulse on impact and faster swing speeds. The head is usually smaller than true woods, however, not extending as far back from the face, and the lie and shaft length are similar to an iron giving similar swing mechanics. These clubs generally replace low-numbered irons in a standard set (between 2 and 5, most commonly 3–4), which are typically the hardest clubs in a player&#x27;s bag to hit well. By doing so they also generally make higher-lofted woods redundant as well. However, some manufacturers produce &quot;iron replacement&quot; sets that use hybrid designs to replace an entire set of traditional irons, from 3 to pitching wedge. Sets designed for less muscular players commonly feature a combination of high-lofted woods (up to 7-wood) and hybrids to replace the 5, 6 and 7-irons, allowing these players to achieve greater carry distances with slower swings.

=== Putter ===
&quot;Putters&quot; are a special class of clubs with a loft not exceeding ten degrees, designed primarily to roll the ball along the grass, generally from a point on the putting green toward the hole. Contrary to popular belief, putters do have a loft (often 5° from truly perpendicular at impact) that helps to lift the ball from any indentation it has made. Newer putters also include grooves on the face to promote roll rather than a skid off the impact. This increases rolling distance and reduces bouncing over the turf. Putters are the only class of club allowed to have certain features, such as two striking faces, non-circular grip cross-sections, bent shafts or hosels, and appendages designed primarily to aid players&#x27; aim.

====Chipper====
The &quot;chipper&quot; is a club designed to feel like a putter but with a more lofted face, used with a putting motion to lift the ball out of the higher grass of the rough and fringe and drop it on the green, where it will then roll like a putt. This club replaces the use of a high-lofted iron to make the same shot, and allows the player to make the shot from a stance and with a motion nearly identical to a putt, which is more difficult with a lofted iron due to a difference in lie angle.

Most chippers have a loft greater than 10 degrees, which is the maximum loft permitted by the Rules of Golf for a club to be classed as a putter, so these clubs are actually classed as irons. To be legal for sanctioned play, a chipper cannot have any feature that is defined in the rules as allowable only on putters, e.g. two striking faces or a flat-topped &quot;putter grip&quot;. This disqualifies many chipper designs, but there are some USGA-conforming chippers, and non-conforming designs can still be used for informal play.

== Construction ==

=== Overview ===
The shafts of the woods were made of different types of wood before being replaced by hickory in the middle of the 19th century. The varieties of woods included ash, purpleheart, orangewood, and blue mahoe.
Despite the strength of hickory, the long-nose club of the mid nineteenth century was still prone to breaking at the top of the back swing. The club heads were often made from woods including apple, pear, dogwood, and beech in the early times until persimmon became the main material. Golf clubs have been improved and the shafts are now made of steel, titanium, other types of metals or carbon fiber. The shaft is a tapered steel tube or a series of stepped steel tubes in telescopic fashion. This has improved the accuracy of golfers. The grips of the clubs are made from leather or rubber.

=== Shaft ===
The shaft is a tapered tube made of metal (usually steel) or carbon fiber composite (referred to as graphite). The shaft is roughly in diameter near the grip and from in length. Shafts weigh from , depending on the material and length.

Shafts are quantified in a number of different ways. The most common is the shaft flex. Simply, the shaft flex is the amount that the shaft will bend when placed under a load. A stiffer shaft will not flex as much, which requires more power to flex and &quot;whip&quot; through the ball properly (which results in higher club speed at impact for more distance), while a more flexible shaft will whip with less power required for better distance on slower swings, but may torque and over-flex if swung with too much power causing the head not to be square at impact, resulting in lower accuracy. Most shaft makers offer a variety of flexes. The most common are: L/W (Lady/Women&#x27;s), A/I (Soft Regular, Intermediate or Senior), R (Regular), S (Stiff), and X (Tour Stiff, Extra Stiff or Strong). A regular flex shaft is generally appropriate for those with an average head speed (), while an A-Flex (or senior shaft) is for players with a slower swing speed (), and the stiffer shafts, such as S-Flex and X-Flex (Stiff and Extra-Stiff shafts) are reserved only for those players with an above average swinging speed, usually above . Some companies also offer a &quot;stiff-regular&quot; or &quot;firm&quot; flex for players whose club speed falls in the upper range of a Regular shaft (), allowing golfers and club makers to fine-tune the flex for a stronger amateur-level player.

At impact, the club head can twist as a result of torque applied to the shaft, reducing accuracy as the face of the club is not square to the player&#x27;s stance. The ability of a shaft to twist along its length due to this torque is fundamentally a function of the flex of the shaft itself; a stiffer shaft will also torque less. To counter torque in more flexible shafts, club makers design the shafts with varying degrees of torque through their length, particularly along the thinnest part of the shaft where it joins with the club head. This results in a point at which the shaft is most flexible, called the &quot;kick point&quot;; above that point the increasing diameter of the shaft makes it more rigid, while below that point the shaft is reinforced internally to reduce torquing of the club head. Shafts have typically been classified as having a low, medium or high kick; a low kick means the shaft will store energy closer to the club head, which means the club head can twist more but also allows for higher club head speeds. A high kick shaft will store energy closer to the grip; such a shaft will feel firmer when swinging it and will give better control over direction, but the same strength swing will flex the shaft less, which will reduce club-head speed.

Widely overlooked as a part of the club, the shaft is considered by many to be the engine of the modern club head. Shafts range in price from a mere US$4 to over US$1200. Current graphite shafts weigh considerably less than their steel counterparts (sometimes weighing less than for a driver shaft), allowing for lighter clubs that can be swung at greater speed. Beginning in the late 1990s, custom shafts have been integrated into the club-making process. These shafts will, within a given flex rating, address specific criteria, such as to launch the ball higher or lower or to adjust for the timing of a player&#x27;s swing to load and unload the shaft at the correct moments of the swing for maximum power. Whereas in the past each club could come with only one shaft, today&#x27;s club heads can be fitted with dozens of different shafts, each with slight variation in behavior, creating the potential for a much better fit for the average golfer.

=== Grip ===
The grip of the club is attached to the opposite end of the shaft from the club head, and is the part of the club the player holds on to while swinging. Originally, the grip was composed of one or more leather strips wrapped around the shaft. The leather outer wrap on a grip is still seen on some clubs, most commonly putters, but most modern grips are a one-piece &quot;sleeve&quot; made of rubber, synthetic or composite material that is slid over the shaft and secured with an adhesive. These sleeve grips allow club makers and golfers to customize the grip&#x27;s diameter, consistency (softness/firmness) and texturing pattern to best fit the player. Clubs with an outer &quot;wrap&quot; of leather or leather-like synthetic still typically have a &quot;sleeve&quot; form underneath to add diameter to the grip and give it its basic profile.

====Grip rules====
According to the rules of golf, all club grips must have the same cross-section shape along their entire length (the diameter can vary), and with the exception of the putter, must have a circular cross-section. The putter may have any cross section that is symmetrical along the length of the grip through at least one plane; &quot;shield&quot; profiles with a flat top and curved underside are common. Grips may taper from thick to thin along their length (and virtually all do), but they are not allowed to have any &quot;waisting&quot; (a thinner section of the grip surrounded by thicker sections above and below it) or &quot;bulges&quot; (thicker sections of the grip surrounded by thinner sections). Minor variations in surface texture (such as the natural variation of a &quot;wrap&quot;-style grip) are not counted unless significant.

====Re-gripping====
Advances in materials have resulted in more durable, longer-lasting soft grips, but nevertheless grips do eventually dry out, harden, or are otherwise damaged and must be replaced. Replacement grips sold as do-it-yourself kits are generally inexpensive and of high quality, although custom grips that are larger, softer, or textured differently from the everyday &quot;wrap&quot;-style grip are generally bought and installed by a clubsmith.

Re-gripping used to require toxic, flammable solvents to soften and activate the adhesive, and a vise to hold the club steady while the grip was forced on. The newest replacement kits, however, use double-sided tape with a water-activated adhesive that is slippery when first activated, allowing easier installation. Once the adhesive cures, it creates a very strong bond between grip and shaft and the grip is usually impossible to remove without cutting it off.

=== Hosel ===

The hosel is the portion of the club head to which the shaft attaches. Hosel design is integral to the balance, feel and power of a club. Modern hosels are designed to place as little mass as possible over the top of the striking face of the club, which lowers the center of gravity of the club for better distance.

=== Club head ===
Each head has one face which contacts the ball during the stroke. Putters may have two striking faces, as long as they are identical and symmetrical. Some chippers (a club similar in appearance to a double-sided putter but having a loft of 35–45 degrees) have two faces, but are not legal. Page 135 of the 2009 USGA rules of golf states:

The club head must have only one striking face, except that a putter may have two such faces if their characteristics are the same, and they are opposite each other.

Page 127 of the USGA rules of golf states:

A putter is a club with a loft not exceeding ten degrees designed primarily for use on the putting green.

Therefore, any double sided club with a loft greater than 10 degrees is not legal.

=== Ferrule ===
The trim ring, usually black (it may have additional trim colors), that is found directly on top of the hosel on many woods and irons. The ferrule is mostly decorative, creating a continuous line between the shaft and the wider hosel, but in some cases it can form part of the securing mechanism between hosel and shaft. Ferrules of differing weights can fine-tune the center of mass of the overall club head, but for these minute adjustments, screw-in weighted inserts at specific points on the club head are usually used instead.

== Club sets ==
The rules of golf limit each player to a maximum of 14 clubs in their bag. Strict rules prohibit sharing of clubs between players that each have their own set (if two players share clubs, they may not have more than 14 clubs combined), and while occasional lending of a club to a player is generally overlooked, habitual borrowing of other players&#x27; clubs or the sharing of a single bag of clubs slows play considerably when both players need the same club.

The most common set of men&#x27;s clubs is:

* A driver, usually numbered a 1-wood regardless of actual loft, which varies from 8° up to 13°
* A fairway wood, typically numbered a 3-wood and lofted about 15° (though 2- and 4-woods are sometimes seen)
* A matched set of 7 numbered irons from 3 through 9, plus a pitching wedge or &quot;10-iron&quot;
* A sand wedge
* A putter

The above set is only 12 clubs; these (or equivalent hybrid substitutes) are found in virtually every golf bag. To this, players typically add two of the following:

* Another fairway wood, often a 5-wood lofted around 18°, to allow other options besides long irons in the 180–250 yard range,
* A hybrid, typically lofted for similar distance as a 3- or 4-iron and usually replacing instead of supplementing those clubs in the bag, and/or
* An additional wedge, usually either: 
** A gap wedge lofted near 52° to fit between the modern pitching and sand wedges in loft, or 
** A lob wedge, typically lofted around 60°, used for tight approach shots from the rough or sand.
* A chipper.

Women&#x27;s club sets are similar in overall makeup, but typically have higher lofts and shorter, more flexible shafts in retail sets to accommodate the average female player&#x27;s height and swing speed.

Variations on this basic set abound; several club options usually exist for almost any shot depending on the player&#x27;s skill level and playing style, and the only club universally considered to be indispensable is the putter. Some consider the modern deep-faced driver to be equally irreplaceable; this is cause for some debate, as professional players including Tiger Woods have played and won tournaments without using a driver, instead using a 3-wood for tee shots and making up the difference on the approach using a lower-lofted iron.

The most common omissions are the &quot;long irons&quot;, numbered from 2 to 5, which are notoriously difficult to hit well. The player can supplement the gaps in distance with either higher-numbered woods such as the 5 and even the 7-wood, or may replace the long irons with equivalently-numbered hybrid clubs. If hybrids are used, higher-lofted woods are often omitted as redundant, but ladies&#x27; and seniors&#x27; sets commonly feature both hybrids and high-lofted woods, omitting the long irons entirely in favor of the lofted woods, and replacing the mid-irons (5–7) with hybrids. The combination allows for higher launch angles on the long-distance clubs, which gives better distance with slower swing speeds. Where a club is omitted and not replaced with a club of similar function, players may add additional clubs of a different function such as additional wedges.

While 14 clubs is a maximum, it is not a minimum; players are free to use any lesser number of clubs they prefer, so substitutions for the common omissions above are not always made; a player may simply choose to play without a 5-wood or 2–4 irons, instead using a 4-wood and moving directly to their 5-iron as desired distance decreases (a 4-wood in a skilled golfer&#x27;s hands averages 200 yards; a 5-iron in the same player&#x27;s hands would be about 160, which is a large gap but not unplayable). Other clubs may be omitted as well. On courses where bags must be carried by the player, the player may take only the odd-numbered irons; without the 4, 6 or 8 irons (the 3 is sometimes removed instead of the 4) the bag&#x27;s weight is considerably reduced. Carrying only a driver, 3-wood, 4-hybrid, 5-7-9 irons, pitching and sand wedges, and a putter reduces the number of clubs in the bag to 9; this is a common load-out for a &quot;Sunday bag&quot; taken to the driving range or to an informal game. A skilled player can usually overcome the lesser selection of club lofts by reducing their swing speed on a lower-loft iron and/or placing the ball further forward in their stance to get the same carry distance and/or launch angle as the next higher loft number. Another increasingly common informal format is a deliberately low upper limit such as four clubs, or three clubs plus putter, with a typical load being a wood or hybrid, middle iron, wedge and putter, although often with significant variation between players with regards to which specific clubs are favored in each role.

== Regulations ==
The ruling authorities of golf, The R&amp;A (formerly part of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews) and the United States Golf Association (USGA), reserve the right to define what shapes and physical characteristics of clubs are permissible in tournament play. The current rules for club design, including the results of various rulings on clubs introduced for play, are defined in Appendix II of the Rules of Golf.

The overarching principle of club design used by both authorities is defined in Appendix II-1a, which states: &quot;The club must not be substantially different from the &quot;traditional and customary form and make&quot;. The club must be composed of a shaft and a head and it may also have material added to the shaft to enable the player to obtain a firm hold (see 3 below). All parts of the club must be fixed so that the club is one unit, and it must have no external attachments.&quot; In addition, Appendix II-4a states, regarding club heads, that &quot;the club head must be generally &quot;plain in shape&quot;. All parts must be rigid, structural in nature and functional. The club head or its parts must not be designed to resemble any other object. It is not practicable to define &#x27;plain in shape&#x27; precisely and comprehensively.&quot;

These two rules are used as the basis for most of the more specific rules of Appendix II, including that no club may have a concave face (1931) and various rules defining what is &quot;traditional&quot; about the shapes of specific clubs, while allowing for the progression of technology. The &quot;traditional and customary&quot; rule was originally used to ban the introduction of steel club shafts (patented in 1910), as that material was not traditional for shafts; that specific ban was rescinded in 1924 by the USGA (the R&amp;A would continue to ban steel shafts until 1929), and steel would become universal until the development of graphite shafts whose introduction was less controversial. The &quot;plain in shape&quot; rule was more recently bent to allow for non-traditional driver club head shapes, such as squares, as a compromise to club-makers after imposing and enforcing a 460cc volume limit on these same club heads.

Many recently developed woods have a marked &quot;trampoline effect&quot; (a large deformation of the face upon impact followed by a quick restoration to original dimensions, acting like a slingshot), resulting in very high ball speeds and great lengths of tee shots. As of 1 January 2008, the USGA and R&amp;A have settled on a regulation that limits the acceptable &quot;trampoline effect&quot; to a coefficient of restitution (COR)—a measurement of the efficiency of the transfer of energy from the club head to the ball—of .830.

Other large scale USGA rulings involve a 1990 lawsuit, and subsequent settlement, against Karsten Manufacturing, makers of the PING brand, for their use of square, or U-grooves in their immensely popular Ping Eye2 irons. The USGA argued that players who used the Eye2 had an unfair advantage in imparting spin on the ball, which helps to stop the ball on the putting greens. The USGA utilized John L. Saksun, founder of Canadian golf company Accuform Golf, as a consultant to set up methods of measuring the unique grooves and determining PING&#x27;s compliance with the rulings. Saksun, by proposing a cost-effective solution to help PING change the design of subsequent Eye2s, saved PING hundreds of millions. PING subsequently withdrew their US$100 million lawsuit against the USGA. Ping’s older clubs were &quot;grandfathered in&quot; and allowed to remain in play as part of the settlement. However, the USGA has begun phasing in a ban on square grooves in golf. Manufacturers were required to discontinue noncompliant clubs by January 1, 2011. According to the USGA, as January 1, 2010, professional golfers on one of the top tours, or those attempting to qualify for one of the three Open Championships (since then four) will need to use new conforming wedges (those without square grooves). Moreover, those who plan to qualify for any other USGA championship (Amateur championships—under 18, Amateur, over 25, and over 50 in both sexes, and four-ball, along with international team championships), will need new conforming wedges by 2014. In addition, this regulation includes IGF and USGA-sanctioned regional amateur events as well, as a &quot;condition of competition&quot;. Wedges that conform to the new standard are often marketed as &quot;CC&quot; or &quot;Condition of Competition&quot; wedges; this moniker is likely to fall into disuse as players upgrade clubs and the use of non-conforming irons diminishes.

<doc id="849914" wikidata="Q627331" url="?curid=849914" title="Rösti">
<text>&#x27; or &#x27; () is a Swiss dish consisting mainly of potatoes, sautéed or shallow-fried in a pan. It was originally a breakfast dish, commonly eaten by farmers in the canton of Bern (and parts of the canton of Fribourg), but is now eaten all over Switzerland and around the world. The French name directly refers to the dish&#x27;s origins. 

Many Swiss people consider to be a national dish. Rather than considering it a complete breakfast, lunch or dinner, it is more commonly served to accompany other dishes such as (spinach and fried eggs, sunny side up), cervelas or Fleischkäse. It is commonly available in Swiss restaurants, as a replacement for the standard side dish of a given meal. 

==Preparation==
 dishes are made with coarsely grated potato, either parboiled or raw. are most often pan-fried and shaped in the frying pan during cooking, but they can also be baked in the oven. Depending on the frying technique, oil, butter, cheese, or another fat may be added (and usually salt and pepper). The grated potatoes are shaped into rounds or patties, usually measuring between in diameter and thick. 

Although basic consists of nothing but potato, a number of additional ingredients are sometimes added, such as bacon, onion, cheese, apple or fresh herbs. This is usually considered to be a regional touch.

==Cultural impact==
In Swiss popular cultural ethos, are predominantly eaten in German-speaking regions, although they can be found easily elsewhere in the country. dishes are portrayed as a stereotypical part of the Swiss-Germanic culture, as opposed to Latin culture. The geographic border separating the French and German-speaking parts of the country is therefore commonly referred to as the &quot;Röstigraben&quot;: literally the &#x27; ditch&#x27;.

<text>Adrian Raeside (born 1957 in Dunedin, New Zealand) is an author, comic strip creator and founder of an animation company. 

== Early years ==
He began drawing cartoons on washroom walls as a kid. After being expelled from his first (and last) art class at the age of 15, he moved with his parents to England, then to Canada. While there, he worked at various jobs, from loading grain ships in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to surveying on the West Coast. Illustrating his mother Joan Raeside&#x27;s children&#x27;s books got him his start in the art business. Raeside began drawing editorial cartoons for the &quot;Times Colonist&quot; in Victoria, British Columbia in 1979. He occupied the editorial cartoonist position until 2015, and after a break he returned to the newspaper in 2019. Raeside&#x27;s editorial cartoons have been reprinted in hundreds of publications worldwide.

== Career ==
Raeside founded and operated an animation company in 1988 to animate editorial cartoons for CBC Television. Over the next four years, he created, directed and produced dozens of animated shows for Turner Broadcasting and Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, adapting two Jim Henson Muppet characters for animation. Raeside adapted the book &quot;The Way Things Work&quot; as an animated series being broadcast on BBC. Raeside left animation production in 1992 but has since written dozens of scripts for animation, series that includes Atomic Betty, The Amazing Adrenalinis and Pirate Express.

In 1990 he created &quot;The Other Coast&quot;, a satirical comic strip which features two dogs and looks at life from a dog&#x27;s perspective. &quot;The Other Coast&quot; appears in hundreds of publications, worldwide.

Raeside is the author of sixteen books, including &quot;There Goes the Neighbourhood&quot;, an irreverent history of Canada; &quot;The Demented Decade&quot;; and&quot; 5 Twisted Years&quot;. Raeside also wrote and illustrated the popular &quot;Dennis the Dragon&quot; series of children&#x27;s books. In 2009 he published Return to Antarctica, an account of his grandfather Sir Charles (Silas) Wrights&#x27; experience on Captain Robert Scott&#x27;s 1910 British Antarctic Expedition to be first to reach the South Pole, which resulted in the death of Scott and four companions. Raeside researched the book by travelling to Cape Evans, in the Ross Sea, following in his grandfather&#x27;s footsteps. Raeside is also related to two other members of the Scott Expedition: Sir Raymond Priestley and Griffith Taylor. Beside the book Return to Antarctica, Raeside produced a 1-hour documentary of the same name. 

In 2012 No Sailing Waits and Other Ferry Tales, a collection of A collection of BC ferry-related editorial cartoons was published by Harbour Publishing, followed by a collection of dog-related strips from The Other Coast strip called Tails don&#x27;t Lie - a Decade of Dog Cartoons (70 in Dog Years) also published by Harbour publishing in 2013, remaining on the bestseller list for over 6 months. Raeside wrote and illustrated The Rainbow Bridge - A Visit to Pet Paradise (Harbour 2012) as a way to comfort those who have lost a pet. Raeside latest book: The Best of Adrian Raeside - A Treasury of BC Cartoons (Harbour 2014) is a collection of the best of his BC-related editorial cartoons.

Adrian Raeside lives in Whistler, British Columbia.

<text>Soyuz T-9 (Russian: Союз Т-9, Union T-9) was the 4th expedition to Salyut 7 following the failed docking of Soyuz T-8. It returned lab experiments to Earth. The next mission, Soyuz 7K-ST No.16L (Soyuz 10a), had exploded and thus failed to launch.

Soyuz T-9 achieved successful docking with the station, although the mission was bracketed by the failed attempt of Soyuz T-8 and the launch pad abort of Soyuz T-10 which would follow immediately.

=== Backup crew ===
== Mission parameters ==
* Mass: 6850 kg
* Perigee: 201 km
* Apogee: 229 km
* Inclination: 51.6°
* Period: 88.6 minutes

== Mission highlights ==
Fourth expedition to Salyut 7. Its mission was heavily impacted by the Soyuz T-8 docking failure and the Soyuz T-10a Soyuz booster failures which bracketed it.

Almost immediately after docking at Salyut 7&#x27;s aft port, the crew entered Kosmos 1443 and commenced transferring the 3.5 tons of cargo lining its walls to Salyut 7.

On 27 July 1983, a small object struck a Salyut 7 viewport. It blasted out a 4-mm crater, but did not penetrate the outer of the window&#x27;s two panes. The Soviets believed it was a member of the Delta Aquariid meteor shower, though it may have been a small piece of orbital debris.

The crew loaded Cosmos 1443&#x27;s VA capsule with 350 kg of experiment results and hardware no longer in use. It could have held 500 kg, had they had that much to put in. Cosmos 1443 then undocked, in spite of Western predictions that the FGB component would remain attached to Salyut 7 as a space station module. The VA capsule soft-landed on 23 August 1983, and the FGB component continued in orbit until it was deorbited over the Pacific Ocean on 19 September 1983.

The crew also filmed scenes for the movie &quot;Return from Orbit&quot;.

<doc id="849922" wikidata="Q12113272" url="?curid=849922" title="1840 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom">
<text>The 1840 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom titled  was the first fully written constitution for the Hawaiian Kingdom. The need for a constitution was originally intended as a manner of laws set forth to control the Native Hawaiian population with a Western style and legal framework, giving less severe punishments, such as being exiled, than was the traditional custom until the 1840s. Christianity had failed to change many behaviors of the Hawaiian population, even with the support of the families. Adultery and many other sexual relations became forbidden. Hawaiians were arrested and sentenced to severe punishments that were not well organised. The exiled had little food and could easily swim away from the islands and the prison at Honolulu Fort. The issue became worse as fewer pardons from the were available, and the overall sentencing then became much more severe for the native population.

==Overview==
The constitution was enacted on October 8, 1840, by King Kamehameha III and Kekāuluohi as &quot;Kuhina Nui&quot;, an office similar to Prime Minister or co-regent. The constitution, compared to its predecessor, was extremely detailed. The June 7, 1839, document, sometimes called a constitution but more similar to a declaration of rights, stated simply that the government was based on Christian values and equality for all. Incorporating the 1839 document, the 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawai’i was a turning point in Hawai’i government.

This constitution organized the power of government and its functions by defining the House of Representatives as the legislative body, giving their people the power to vote, proclaiming the House of Kamehameha, establishing of the office of Kuhina Nui, creating of the office of royal governors of the various islands and recognizing Christianity as an authority.

==Amendments==
It could be changed by section 13, which gave the House of Nobles and the House of Representatives the ability to change the constitution.

<doc id="849925" wikidata="Q5251354" url="?curid=849925" title="Defense Acquisition University">
<text>The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) is a corporate university of the United States Department of Defense offering &quot;acquisition, technology, and logistics&quot; (AT&amp;L) training to military and Federal civilian staff and Federal contractors. DAU is headquartered in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and is accredited by the American Council on Education (ACE), International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET) and the Council on Occupational Education (COE).

==History==
The University Charter was created in October 1991 by Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5000.57. Originally a loose consortium of existing training commands, DAU worked to standardize the training courses and establish mechanisms that allowed for centralized management of training funds for the DoD workforce.

In the late 1990s, the consortium arrangement was replaced by a centralized structure, more like that of a corporate university. By 2014, DAU had grown to the point of graduating 181,970 students.

===Leadership===
DAU was headed by a Commandant until the year 2000 when it became a civilian institution, and since then the chief executive position has the title &quot;President.&quot; DAU&#x27;s Commandants and Presidents have included William L. Vincent (1991–1993), Claude M. Bolton (1993–1996), Richard A. Black (1996–1997), Leonard Vincent (1997–1999), Frank J. Anderson (1999–2010), Katrina McFarland (2011–2012), James P. Woolsey (2013–2024), and Bilyana Anderson (2024–Present).

==Locations==
DAU is headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and serves the approximately 160,000 members of the defense acquisition workforce. DAU also has several other locations across the United States as well an online presence. These locations include:
* DAU Capital and Northeast, located at Fort Belvoir, provides services to The Pentagon and Washington DC Department of Defense agencies, and acquisition&amp; sustainment organizations throughout the Northeast. It serves a workforce of about 35,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;capital/northeast&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Defense Systems Management College, also located at Ft Belvoir, on the same campus as the Capital and Northeast Region
* DAU Mid-Atlantic, located in California, Maryland (near the Patuxent River Naval Air Station)
* DAU South, in Huntsville, Alabama on Redstone Arsenal, serving 41,000+ members
* DAU Midwest, located in Kettering, Ohio (just outside Wright-Patterson Air Force Base), serving 25,000+ members
* DAU West in San Diego, serving 30,013 people (as of 2021)
* Various satellite locations at major military commands

==Admissions and costs==
Applicants must have a current affiliation with the United States government in order to attend training courses offered by DAU. The United States Military Services and the DoD have internal registration and quotas for DAU instructor-led courses, while the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) accepts applications and registers most non-DoD students.

U.S. Federal employees and defense contractors may attend DAU courses at no cost when space is available, and may enroll in DAU&#x27;s Defense acquisition credential learning pathways, and in online courses. DAU charges tuition only to certain foreign students.

==Training and certificates==

The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) requires Defense Acquisition Workforce members to be certified for the positions they hold. DAU offers training courses for all Defense Acquisition Workforce members in 7 functional areas and at three certification levels.

Functional Areas:
* Auditing
* Business: 
** Financial Management
** Cost Estimating
* Contracting
* Engineering and Technical Management
* Life Cycle Logistics
* Program Management
* Test and Evaluation

The American Council on Education (ACE) assigns ACE credits to various DAU courses. DAU coursework can apply toward college and university degrees and certificates at some partner institutions.

===Defense Acquisition Guide===
The Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG) is a text developed to aid in the understanding and implementation of United States Department of Defense Acquisition practices under the DoD Directive 5000 series. This text, also available in web-accessed electronic format and web-structured HTML basis (see https://aaf.dau.edu/guidebooks/) provides insight to a life cycle view and functional roles within the lifecycle of acquisitions.

In 2002 the DOD 5000.2-R became the Interim Defense Acquisition Guidebook.

==Mission assistance==
DAU instructors are available to consult and assist acquisition organizations in the design and review of processes and internal training when they are not teaching. They can also provide workshops and specific topic instruction in areas of interest or concern tailored to a specific organization.

==Hacking incident==
In July 2011 a hacking incident occurred affecting DAU&#x27;s Web-based training site. This incident occurred on a vendor&#x27;s network that provided the learning management system&#x27;s underlying source code and inhibited access to online courses for almost two months. While DAU was not hacked, U.S. Cyber Command (U.S. CYBERCOM) evaluated the risk level to DAU&#x27;s system based on the incident that occurred on the vendor&#x27;s network, and temporarily suspended online training courses to secure the system and protect students&#x27; personal information.

<doc id="849926" wikidata="Q7904053" url="?curid=849926" title="1997 Uxbridge by-election">
<text>The 1997 Uxbridge by-election was a parliamentary by-election held in July 1997 to elect a new Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Uxbridge in Greater London, England. The seat was held by the Conservative Party, their first such victory since 1989.

==Background==
The vacancy was caused by the death of the Conservative MP Michael Shersby, who died unexpectedly on 8 May 1997, just seven days after his being returned to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election. Although that election saw the end of 18 years of Conservative rule as Labour won by a landslide, Shersby won a narrow victory over Labour Party candidate David Williams.

The by-election was called for Thursday, 31 July 1997 and was the first by-election of the 1997-2001 parliament.

==Candidates==
David Williams, the Labour general election candidate was not placed on the by-election shortlist, which the BBC reported had &quot;infuriated&quot; some members. Activist Michael Shrimpton was also passed over, leading to his defection to the Conservatives. The Labour Party eventually chose Andy Slaughter, the Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council, over the Barrister Willie Bach from Nottinghamshire. The Conservative Party selected John Randall, the Managing Director of the century-old Randall&#x27;s Furniture Store in Uxbridge. Keith Kerr, a senior executive with British Airways, represented the Liberal Democrats. Eight other candidates also stood, including perennial candidates Screaming Lord Sutch and Ronnie Carroll.

==Campaign==
Labour&#x27;s concentrated campaign included an unusual visit by Prime Minister Tony Blair. This was unusual in that a sitting Prime Minister does not normally campaign personally in by-elections for fear that a defeat may harm his own political standing. Conservative leader William Hague was the first leader of his party to campaign in a by-election for 20 years. The Conservative campaign was criticised by some members for keeping records of how much time would-be future parliamentary candidates had spent in the constituency.

==Results and aftermath==
In the end, the Conservative candidate was elected by a large majority, gaining over 50% of all votes cast, while the Labour and Liberal Democrat votes both fell. It was the first time the Conservatives held onto a seat at a by-election since the 1989 Richmond by-election (when the candidate was William Hague - who had become leader of the party shortly before the Uxbridge by-election).

Randall represented the seat (and its successor, Uxbridge and South Ruislip) until standing down in 2015. Slaughter entered parliament eight years later, winning the seat of Ealing, Acton and Shepherds Bush in 2005. He has represented the Hammersmith constituency since 2010.

<text>The Bear and the Dragon is a techno-thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and released on August 21, 2000. A direct sequel to &quot;Executive Orders&quot; (1996), President Jack Ryan deals with a war between Russia and China, referred respectively in the title as the Russian Bear and the Chinese Dragon. At over 1,028 pages, it is Clancy&#x27;s second longest novel, &quot;Executive Orders&quot; being the longest. The book debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Plot summary== 
In Moscow, SVR director Sergey Golovko survives an attack on his way to work, when a car identical to the armored white Mercedes that he was in was shot with an RPG-7, killing the occupants (one of them a former KGB agent turned pimp) inside. Investigation of the incident by Russian police and later intelligence officers points to involvement from Chinese intelligence, and that Golovko was the real target. After the failed attempt on the SVR director&#x27;s life, the Chinese later plot to assassinate the Russian president, but their agent, also a former KGB officer, is arrested by the FSB.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Jack Ryan gives Taiwan diplomatic status, which is implied as retaliation to China for secretly assisting in previous plots by Japan (&quot;Debt of Honor&quot;) and Iran (&quot;Executive Orders&quot;) against the U.S. Months later, during trade negotiations between the U.S. and China in Beijing, a CNN crew witnesses the murders of the Papal Nuncio to the country and a Chinese Baptist minister, when the two attempt to stop Chinese authorities from performing a forced abortion on one of the latter&#x27;s followers. Two days later, police officers brutally break up a prayer service led by the Baptist minister&#x27;s widow in their home, who had been outraged that her husband&#x27;s body was cremated and dumped into a river without her permission. International outrage over the incidents leads to a boycott on Chinese-made products. With its economy already struggling due to recent military expansions, the country hastens its planned invasion of Siberia to access newly discovered oil and gold fields.

Ryan persuades NATO to admit Russia, and promises assistance against China to the Russian president. When the Chinese enter Siberia, the Russians repel their invasion force with help from the United States, causing heavy casualties on the Chinese side. The U.S. Navy attacks the Chinese mainland&#x27;s coastal defenses and destroys much of the Chinese navy&#x27;s aging fleet while it lies in port. F-117 Nighthawks destroy railroad bridges in Harbin and Bei&#x27;an with GBU-27 Paveway IIIs, seriously damaging Chinese lines of communication for their army in Russia. Ryan later decides to broadcast CNN&#x27;s coverage of the war, plus direct feeds from U.S. reconnaissance drones, over a CIA website to counter the Chinese government&#x27;s propaganda about the war&#x27;s status and purpose.

Beijing&#x27;s increasingly desperate leaders decide to ready their ICBMs for a potential launch. A joint NATO-Russian special operations team led by Rainbow operative John Clark is dispatched to destroy them. The team destroys all but two of the Chinese missiles. Of the two that launch, one is shot down by an AH-64 Apache while the second heads toward Washington, D.C. Ryan&#x27;s family is evacuated, but Ryan himself decides at the last minute to stay behind on board a docked naval ship, the USS &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, which is equipped with the experimental Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. Ryan watches as the ship destroys the ICBM at the last possible moment. News footage of the ICBM&#x27;s interception is later streamed through the CIA website.

Meanwhile, in Beijing, a group of Chinese students, spurred on by what they have seen on the CIA website, march through Tiananmen Square and invade a Politburo meeting, setting the stage for an overthrow of the government. A reformist Politburo member, Fang Gan, takes over and has the Communist leaders responsible for the debacle arrested, then orders an immediate withdrawal of Chinese forces from Siberia. Fang next holds an open discussion with the student leaders.

==Reception==
The book received mixed reviews. While comparing it to Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1869), &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the novel for its &quot;excitingly cinematic climax&quot;, as well as for an abundance of African-American characters. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted &quot;a handbook&#x27;s worth of intoxicating, expertly researched, seemingly inside information&quot;. On the other hand, the book was criticized for its length, racist depiction of Chinese characters, and overreliance on right-wing politics. In a negative review, &quot;The Guardian&quot; bemoaned the length as &quot;on full autopilot, and readers who haven&#x27;t already quit from exhaustion might get the sneaking suspicion that the author too has long jumped ship&quot;, continuing: &quot;Given [Clancy&#x27;s] top-selling status, he has clearly progressed beyond any kind of editing.&quot;

<doc id="849939" wikidata="Q847047" url="?curid=849939" title="Soyuz 7K-ST No.16L">
<text>Soyuz 7K-ST No.16L, sometimes known as Soyuz T-10a or Soyuz T-10-1, was an unsuccessful Soyuz mission intended to visit the Salyut 7 space station, which was occupied by the Soyuz T-9 crew. However, it never finished its launch countdown; the launch vehicle was destroyed on the launch pad by fire on 26 September 1983. The launch escape system of the Soyuz spacecraft fired six seconds before the launch vehicle exploded, saving the crew. As of 2025, it remains the only time a launch escape system has been fired before launch with a crew aboard.

The Soyuz T-10-1 explosion would also remain the only instance of a Russian crewed booster accident in 35 years, until the Soyuz MS-10 flight aborted shortly after launch on 11 October 2018 due to a failure of the Soyuz-FG launch vehicle boosters.

== Crew ==
== Mission highlights ==
The crew was sitting on the pad awaiting fueling of the Soyuz-U booster to complete prior to liftoff. Approximately 90 seconds before the intended launch, a bad valve caused nitrogen pressurisation gas to enter the RP-1 turbopump of the Blok B strap-on. The pump began spinning up, but with no propellant in it, the speed of rotation quickly exceeded its design limits which caused it to rupture and allow RP-1 to leak out and start a fire which quickly engulfed the base of the launch vehicle. Titov and Strekalov could not see what was happening outside, but they felt unusual vibrations and realized that something was amiss. The launch control team activated the escape system but the control cables had already burned through, and the Soyuz crew could not activate or control the escape system themselves. The backup radio command to fire the LES required 2 independent operators to receive separate commands to do so and each act within 5 seconds, which took several seconds to occur. Then explosive bolts fired to separate the descent module from the service module and the upper launch payload shroud from the lower, the escape system motor fired, dragging the orbital module and descent module, encased within the upper shroud, free of the booster with an acceleration of 14 to 17&quot;g&quot; (137 to 167 m/s²) for five seconds. According to Titov, &quot;We could feel the booster swaying from side to side. Then there was a sudden vibration and a jerking sensation as the LES activated&quot;.

Just after the escape tower pulled the descent module away, the booster exploded. Its remains burned on the pad for nearly 20 hours. Four grid fins on the outside of the shroud opened and the descent module separated from the orbital module at an altitude of , dropping free of the shroud. The descent module discarded its heat shield, exposing the solid-fuel landing rockets, and deployed a fast-opening emergency parachute. Touchdown occurred about from the launch pad. The two crew members were bruised badly after the high acceleration, but were otherwise in good health and did not require any medical attention. Upon being greeted by recovery crews, they immediately asked for cigarettes to steady their nerves. The cosmonauts were then each given a tumbler of vodka to help them relax.

The KH-11 reconnaissance satellites returned photos of the damaged Site 1 in several runs during late 1983 and early 1984. The descent module was refurbished and later used for Soyuz T-15.

The failure&#x27;s immediate result was the inability to replace the ageing Soyuz T-9 return capsule attached to the Salyut 7 space station. This resulted in dire reports in the western media about the cosmonauts remaining aboard Salyut 7 (which had arrived several months before in the Soyuz T-9) being &#x27;stranded&#x27; in space, with no ability to return. Official reports by the Soviet news agency TASS gave few details, merely saying that there had been a pad accident and the cosmonauts were rescued by the LES. It was not until several years later during glasnost that the full story of the accident was revealed to the outside world. Years later, in an interview with the United States History Channel regarding the flight, Titov claimed that the crew&#x27;s first action after the escape rocket fired was to deactivate the spacecraft&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder because, as he put it, &quot;We were swearing&quot;.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 4, also known as Highway 4, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. Originally much longer than its present length, more than half of Highway 4 was transferred to the responsibility of local governments in 1998. It travels between Highway 3 in Talbotville Royal, north-west of St. Thomas, and Highway 8 in Clinton, passing through the city of London inbetween.

Highway 4 was first designated in 1920, when a route between Talbotville Royal and Elginfield was assumed by the Department of Highways. It was extended in the early 1930s both south to Port Stanley as well as north to Flesherton.

==Route description==
Highway4 starts at an intersection with Highway3 in Talbotville Royal and continues north as a two-lane undivided highway. For most of its length, the highway bisects agricultural land. It travels along a short concurrency with Highway 401 from the community of Tempo to Wonderland Road. It encounters an interchange with Highway 402 before entering London city limits. As Highway4 enters London, it becomes a Connecting Link, known locally as Wonderland Road. Wonderland Road is a 4-lane arterial thoroughfare serving western London, with several big-box stores, a mall, and residential areas. The route turns east onto Sunningdale Road West, which it for a short distance before turning north along Richmond Street.

Highway4 continues north, passing through Arva, when the surrounding terrain returns to farmland. Highway4 passes through Birr before intersecting with the western terminus of Highway 7 at Elginfield, which is also 1 km east of the Highway 23 junction with Highway7. The highway then curves slightly west, passing through Lucan before continuing north at Clandeboye. From here to its terminus in Clinton, Highway4 is essentially straight for . Continuing to be flanked by farmland, it then passes through the communities of Huron Park and Exeter. At Exeter, it crosses the former route of Highway 83. From there, it continues north, passing through the communities of Hensall, Ontario and Vanastra, Ontario before terminating at Highway8 in the community of Clinton.
==History==
Highway4 was originally designated in 1920 when the provincial government assumed the road running from Talbotville Royal (St. Thomas) to the Northern Highway (later Highway7) at Elginfield, via London. The portions within Elgin County were assumed on August4, while the portions south of London were assumed on June24. The portions north of and through London were assumed on August6.
The route featured a concurrency with the Provincial Highway (later Highway2) between Lambeth and downtown London.

Until the summer of 1925, Ontario highways were named rather than numbered. When route numbering was introduced, the route between St. Thomas and Elginfield became Provincial Highway4.
1927 saw several new sections of road assumed that would become portion of Highway4. On September14, the route was extended to Highway 8 at Clinton. Further north, a new highway was created on June22, 1927, between Highway 9 at Walkerton and Highway 6 at Durham. This latter section was designated as Highway4A.

On March12, 1930, Highway4 was extended to Durham, fully absorbing the route of Highway4A in the process. Two months later, on May11, it was extended south to Bedford Street (now Edith Cavell Boulevard) in Port Stanley. On April11, 1934, the highway was extended east to the intersection of Highway 10 in Flesherton. Highway4 reached its maximum length of when it was extended from Flesherton to Highway 24 in Singhampton in the mid-1970s.

=== Downloads ===
As part of a series of budget cuts initiated by premier Mike Harris under his Common Sense Revolution platform in 1995, numerous highways deemed to no longer be of significance to the provincial network were decommissioned and responsibility for the routes transferred to a lower level of government, a process referred to as downloading. Portions of Highway4 were transferred to the counties of Elgin, Huron, Bruce and Grey on January1, 1998.

The former portion of Highway 4 south of St. Thomas is now signed as Elgin County Road 4. The former northern portion is broken into several different roads:
* Huron County Road 4 from Clinton to near Wingham
* Bruce County Road 4 (London Road) from near Wingham to Riversdale
* A former concurrency with Highway9 between Riversdale and Walkerton
* Grey County Road 4 from Walkerton to Simcoe County Road 124 just south of Singhampton

In 2017, the City of London announced that Highway 4 through London would be re-signed and re-routed via Richmond Street, Sunningdale Road, and Wonderland Road, resulting in a short concurrency with Highway 401 between the Colonel Talbot Road and Wonderland Road interchanges.

<text>The Candlelight Party (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ) is a liberal party in Cambodia. The party was a member of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats, Liberal International, and the Alliance of Democrats. It is the largest opposition party in Cambodia, and the main challenger to the ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party. The party, which would have been the only competitive opposition party to the CPP, was disqualified from running in the 2023 election by the National Election Committee despite previously being permitted to participate in the 2022 local elections. The party resumed political activity in October 2021 after having been inactive since 2012.

The party, founded in 1995 as the Khmer Nation Party, renamed the Sam Rainsy Party in 1998, and it was renamed the Candlelight Party in 2018. This party is currently the official opposition to the ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party. Since the decline of the junior coalition partner, FUNCINPEC, in the 2008 National Assembly elections, the Candlelight Party is now considered the second largest party and the largest opposition party in Cambodia. The party won 15 of the 123 seats in the National Assembly in the 1998 elections, 24 seats in the 2003 elections, and 26 seats in the 2008 elections. The CP won two seats in the 2006 Senate elections. In 2009, it formally allied with the Human Rights Party in the Democratic Movement of Change.

In 2008, party activist Tuot Saron was arrested on a charge of &quot;being an accomplice to unlawful confinement&quot;. International human rights groups including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International described the charges as a politically motivated attempt to intimidate other SRP activists. Tuot Saron was released on 26 November 2010, following a Royal Pardon decree. In July 2024, Candlelight Party President Teav Vannol was fined 6 billion riels (approximately $1.5 million) for “defaming” the Cambodian government to foreign media.

<text>Prince Ariimate Teururai, later known as King Tamatoa VI (7 June 1853 – 15 September 1905), was a member of a Tahitian royal family, the &quot;House of Teururai&quot; which reigned on the Tahitian island of Huahiné and Maia&#x27;o during the 19th century.

He was installed as king of Ra&#x27;iatea and Taha&#x27;a in 1884, but was deposed in 1888.

==Biography==

<doc id="849952" wikidata="Q2579210" url="?curid=849952" title="Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet, or His Majesty’s Most Loyal Opposition Shadow Cabinet, but usually simply the Shadow Cabinet, is the committee of senior members of the Official Opposition who scrutinise the work of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. Each Shadow Cabinet member is typically given a position which corresponds to that of a government minister in Cabinet. 

==Composition==
Shadow Cabinet members, commonly known as shadow ministers, are usually appointed by the leader of the Opposition (currently Kemi Badenoch). The roles of shadow ministers are to develop alternative policies, hold the government to account for its actions and responses, and act as spokespeople for the opposition party in their own specific policy areas. By convention, shadow ministers are drawn either from serving members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords, with most chosen from the former. Since July 2024, the Conservative Party has been the Official Opposition, and its leadership therefore forms the current Shadow Cabinet.

Not all opposition frontbenchers are members of the Shadow Cabinet, which is composed of the most senior opposition members (usually they number around twenty).

The leader of the Opposition, the Opposition chief whip and Opposition deputy chief whip are the only members of the Official Opposition in the House of Commons to be paid for their opposition roles in addition to their salaries as members of Parliament. The leader of the Opposition and the Opposition chief whip in the House of Lords also receive a salary.

Other parties may also form frontbench teams of spokespeople which may be referred to as shadow cabinets by the party (e.g. the Liberal Democrats in 2019), but these are not part of the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet.

==Current Shadow Cabinet==
, the members of the shadow cabinet are:

<text>Soyuz T-10 was the fifth expedition to the Salyut 7 space station. It entered a darkened and empty station because of the loss of Soyuz T-10a. It was visited by the sixth and seventh expeditions. During the course of the cosmonauts stay, three extravehicular activities took place to repair a fuel line.

During their multiple spacewalks to perform maintenance on the station, the crew set a record for spacewalk hours.

* Period: 88.7 minutes

== Mission highlights ==
Fifth expedition to Salyut 7. Visited by 6th and 7th expeditions. The three-person Mayak crew entered the darkened Salyut 7 station carrying flashlights. The cosmonauts commented on the burnt-metal odor of the drogue docking unit. By 17 February 1984, Salyut 7 was fully reactivated, and the cosmonauts had settled into a routine. Physician Oleg Atkov did household chores and monitored his own health and that of his colleagues, who conducted experiments. During the previous year a fuel line on the station had ruptured. Kizim and Solovyov carried out three EVAs to try to fix the problem during the mission.

Its objective is to educate children of the Indian Defence Services personnel who are often posted to remote locations. With the army starting its own Army Public Schools, the service was extended but not restricted to all central government employees.

A uniform curriculum is followed by schools all over India. By providing a common syllabus and system of education, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are intended to ensure that the children of government employees do not face educational disadvantages when their parents are transferred from one location to another. The schools have been operational for more than 60 years.

==Management==
The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan or &#x27;Central Schools Organisation&#x27;(as previously known), oversees the functioning of the schools with its headquarters in New Delhi. The administration of this body is based on three levels. The chairman of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is always the Minister in Charge of the Ministry of Education of the Government of India; the deputy chairman is the Minister of State of the Ministry of Education. The real working power lies with the Commissioner of KVS. There are Additional Commissioners and Joint commissioners to accompany the Commissioner in the administration of KVS in different fields. The head of the KVs in a region is a Deputy Commissioner accompanied by two to three Assistant Commissioners. At present, there are 25 regional offices in KVS. There are individual principals of every KV, administering the schools along with a Vice-Principal (wherever there is a vacancy for the post) and Head Master/ Mistress.

The Vidyalaya also has several committees for the holistic development of the students and well maintenance of the school compound and system. The most important one is the VMC (Vidyalaya Management Committee), which is the head of all committees.

==Schools==
, there were 1,256 schools named Kendriya Vidyalayas, having started with only 20 schools in the year 1963. It is one of the largest school chains in world with 1,253 schools in India and three operated abroad. A total of 14,30,442 students () and 43,888 employees were on the rolls (). KVS has been recognized as an independent State by Bharat Scouts &amp; Guides Movement as around 2,49,198 students enrolled as the Scouts, Guides, Cubs and Bulbuls. Kendriya Vidyalayas are spread among 25 regions, each headed by a deputy commissioner. The three Kendriya Vidyalayas outside India is in Kathmandu, Moscow, and Tehran situated inside Indian Embassies of these countries and their expenditures are borne by the Ministry of External Affairs. They are intended for children of Indian embassy staff and other expatriate employees of the Government of India.

One school in Tsimalakha, Bhutan, was transferred to the Bhutanese Government, thus ceasing to be a Kendriya Vidyalaya (then known as Indo-Bhutan Central School (IBCS)) in 1989, after one of the major Indo-Bhutan projects (the Chukhha Hydal power project) was near completion. Indian Government employees were gradually transferred back to their own country.

All the schools share a common syllabus and offer bilingual instruction, in English and Hindi. They are co-educational. Sanskrit is taught as a compulsory subject from classes VI to VIII and as an optional subject until class XII. Students in classes VI to VIII could study the German language until November 2014, when the scheme was discontinued. But was again recontinued and is available in some schools until class 10. In Moscow, students are given an opportunity to choose French or Russian as their third or second language.

Tuition fees are charged for Kendriya Vidyalaya students have to pay the school development fund (&quot;Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi&quot;), with the proceeds spent on the development of that particular school. Students from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and children of KVS employees are exempt from tuition fees. Girls who are their parents&#x27; only child from class VI onward are exempt from tuition and school development fund.

A significant aspect of Kendriya Vidyalaya culture is the daily recitation of a common prayer during morning assemblies. This prayer, often delivered in Sanskrit or Hindi, includes the verse:
&quot;Daya kar daan vidya ka humein paramatma dena&quot;. Translation: &quot;O God, be merciful and grant us the gift of knowledge.&quot; This ritual not only instills a sense of discipline but also reflects the educational ethos of seeking divine guidance in the pursuit of knowledge.

KVS also had the MP Quota which involved some special provision under which admissions are given. Members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha could recommend a few number of students for the admission. These Special Provisions only worked in KVs located in the constituency of the MP concerned. All members of parliament could recommend up to six students from their constituency for admission to a Kendriya Vidyalaya. From the academic session 2016–17, the quota had been increased to 10 students.
However, it is since the academic session 2022-23 all admission under special provisions like MP quota, quota of sponsoring agency (chairman quota) have been made dysfunctional.

The Quality Council of India (QCI) has accredited three of KV schools: KV RK Puram, KV IIT Powai and KV Bhinga. The Kendriya Vidyalaya Gole Market school in Central Delhi has earned notice for upgrading to &quot;E-Classroom&quot; and e-Learning teaching processes with the implementation of Smart Boards in the classroom. This school produces an annual school magazine called &quot;Vidyalaya Patrika&quot;.

The organisation is one of the few schools that offers all varieties in sports, games, activities and the largest scope of subjects offered by CBSE to its students and is known for its holistic focus.

It has been felicitated with many awards by Government of India including the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puruskar in 2017 and Rajbhasha Kirti Puraskar on the occasion of Hindi Diwas in 2018–19.

<doc id="849967" wikidata="Q826525" url="?curid=849967" title="Cape vulture">
<text>The Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres), also known as Cape griffon and Kolbe&#x27;s vulture, is an Old World vulture in the family Accipitridae. It is endemic to southern Africa, and lives mainly in South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, and in some parts of northern Namibia. It nests on cliffs and lays one egg per year. In 2015, it had been classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, but was down-listed to Vulnerable in 2021 as some populations increased and have been stable since about 2016. 

==Description==
This large vulture is of a creamy-buff colour, with contrasting dark flight and tail feathers. The adult is paler than the juvenile, and its underwing coverts can appear almost white at a distance. The head and neck are near-naked. The eyes are yellowish, and the bill is black. Juveniles and immatures are generally darker and more streaked, with brown to orange eyes and red necks. It closely resembles the white-backed vulture, however it is larger and has yellow irises.

The average length of adult vultures is about with a wingspan of and a body weight of . The two prominent bare skin patches at the base of the neck, also found in the white-backed vulture, are thought to be temperature sensors and used for detecting the presence of thermals. The species is among the largest raptors in Africa, next to the lappet-faced vulture. With a mean body mass of roughly , it appears to be significantly heavier than wild lappet-faced vultures, despite the latter&#x27;s extremely large appearance, and rivals only a few other species, namely the great white pelican and kori bustard, as the largest flying bird native to Africa. After the Himalayan griffon vulture and the cinereous vulture, the Cape vulture is the third largest Old World vulture on average.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Cape vulture is resident and breeding in Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique and South Africa, but is vagrant in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia. It also occurs in Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Eswatini but does not breed there. They are obligate scavengers, they feed on carrion, eating soft muscles and organ tissues and some bone fragments. They search for food in groups, they can spot the carcasses from a long distance meaning that they have good eyesight. They are able to locate the carcass quicker than other ground-dwelling scavengers.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
===Breeding===
It usually breeds and roosts on cliff faces in or near mountains, and has been recorded up to an elevation of . In South Africa&#x27;s Eastern Cape, Cape vultures were more likely to use nest sites on ledges with a smaller depth and at a higher elevation, surrounded by conspecifics. Tracked individuals in Namibia had home ranges of . They also roost on trees and pylons. Additionally, juveniles and adults both prefer to roost on cliffs located closer to colonies. It is also believed that they tend to remain or return to the area of birth for breeding.

In Colleywobbles Vulture Colony in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, the fledglings had a mean post-fledging dependency period of 101 days, and the distance from the nest increased after this period, as the fledglings gained independence from their parents. Though they continue to breed, some populations have been recorded to have declined. Roberts’ Farm in Magaliesberg, was abandoned as a breeding site in 2013.

==Conservation and threats==

The Cape vulture has been declining steadily since at least the 1980s, when it was first categorised as Threatened. Between 1992 and 2007 the species declined by 60-70% in South Africa alone. By 2021, the total population size was estimated about 9,600 to 12,800 mature individuals, and it was assessed as Vulnerable.

The Cape vulture is considered to be impacted by a number of threats. A decrease in the amount of large carrion particularly during nesting, targeted or inadvertent poisoning, loss of foraging habitat, and unsustainable harvesting for traditional uses are thought to be the most important factors. A source of poisoning specific to many vultures, including the Cape vulture, is the drug &quot;Diclofenac&quot; and related compounds, which is used to treat arthritis in cattle, and which lead to kidney failure in vultures who consume carcasses of treated cattle. Electrocution resulting from collision with cables on electricity pylons is the most common cause of death in ringed birds.

On the 20th of June 2019, the carcasses of 468 white-backed vultures, 17 white-headed vultures, 28 hooded vultures, 14 lappet-faced vultures and 10 cape vultures, altogether 537 vultures, besides 2 tawny eagles, were found in northern Botswana. It is suspected that they died after eating the carcasses of 3 elephants that were poisoned by poachers, possibly to avoid detection by the birds, which help rangers to track poaching activity by circling above where there are dead animals. 

Climate change has contributed as a threat for the endemic species, populations have decreased due to the high temperatures and global warming. There is still need to alter laws to achieve great conservation, as most laws in South Africa are implemented at a provincial scale. All vulture species can be elevated to &#x27;Specially Protected&#x27; status to help increase their populations.

==Human wildlife conflict==
There is still a need to deal with human-wildlife conflicts, farmers still need to be made aware of the effects of poisoning. In Namibia, 1.7% of communal farmers admitted to using poison in the year 2015. In Kenya, over 20% of farmers used poisons to eliminate predators and they were not aware of the Kenya Wildlife Act. It was then suggested that awareness campaigns should be implemented to reduce poisoning. In addition, a combination of top-down, e.g. legislation, and bottom-up such as corrals or compensation is expected to help reduce the problem.

<text>The Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) was an unaccredited institute headquartered in New Delhi, which previously had 18 branches across India. IIPM was shut down after multiple allegations and lawsuits concerning the institute&#x27;s use of false advertisements and fraudulent practices. After several controversies, the school&#x27;s Honorary Dean Arindam Chaudhuri decided to shut down all campuses across India, except the one in Delhi. Founded in 1973, the institute used to offer undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes in national economic planning and entrepreneurship, and international and fellowship programmes. Its executive education programmes include non-credit courses and visits to foreign business schools. IIPM is not accredited by UGC or All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and is not affiliated with the public Indian Institutes of Management.

IIPM has been involved in controversies about its advertising. The University Grants Commission (UGC)a government organisation responsible for the standards of university education in Indiaand the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have repeatedly issued public notices stating that they do not recognise IIPM, and that they deem its technical programmes invalid. IIPM has responded by stating that it does not issue degrees and that it is not a university. In September 2014 Delhi High Court censured IIPM for misleading students and restrained it from using words like MBA, BBA, management course, and B-school to describe the programs it offered.

In July 2015, IIPM announced that it would stop offering education programmes directly, and shut down all its campuses outside Delhi. As of 2024, IIPM operates only as a research and training institute in Delhi.

== History ==
IIPM was founded in 1973 in New Delhi. According to the institute its first residential, full-time, post-graduate diploma programme began in 1974. IIPM had 18 branches across India; in New Delhi, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Noida, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Pune, Lucknow, Indore, Bhubaneshwar, Bhopal, Jaipur, Dehradun, and Cochin.

IIPM was barred by the UGC from offering among other degrees, MBA or BBA programs after irregularities surfaced on its claims and functioning. IIPM then closed all its branches save for a research and training institute in Delhi. A UGC notice marks IIPM Delhi as unrecognized. The founding director of IIPM is Dr. M. K. Chaudhuri, and the honorary dean is Arindam Chaudhuri.

==Facilities and faculty==

IIPM has a three-acre campus in New Delhi. The facilities at the branches vary but are usually less extensive compared to the main campus. The teaching faculty of the institute mostly comprises its own alumni and visiting professors. About 20% of the faculty have doctoral degrees. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, IIPM has recruited many international professors to teach in India. The institute has built up its teaching faculty by recruiting its own alumni. Under the Global Outreach Programme, IIPM invites faculty members from business schools to its campuses to teach its students.

==Academics==
===Offered programmes===
IIPM is an academic partner of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, which issues degrees to IIPM students. According to the institute, it offers international programmes and programmes under its School of Business and Economy. These include undergraduate programs in planning and entrepreneurship lasting three years and postgraduate programs in the same subject lasting two years. A one-year postgraduate course is available for working executives with at least two years of past work experience. The institute also offers PhD and Fellowship programmes for postgraduates. The institute does not award BBA or MBA degrees; it awards certificates for its students who can then apply for degrees from allied institutions. Since 2010, IIPM students can get MBA and BBA degrees from Manonmaniam Sundaranar University.

===Courses===
Under its programmes in planning and entrepreneurship, the institute offers certificate courses aimed at making students eligible for degree courses. The IIPM course lasts 22 months and includes 1,944 hours of teaching. The postgraduate programme has 1,920 contact hours. The institute tries to give its students a &quot;hands on&quot; approach to learning, assigning them to work on consulting projects in major firms. In the first year, core subjects include marketing, accounting, finance, economics and organizational behaviour. In the second year, marketing and IT courses are compulsory and students choose a major in human resource or finance. The institute also offers courses that take unconventional approaches to business management. There is a focus on developing executive communication.

All students of the institute attend a 21-day compulsory trip to Europe as part of its Global Opportunities and Threat Analysis (GOTA) programme. The programme arranges visits to multinational firms and political organisations. Since 2008, students have visited Africa and Australia under the GOTA programme.

=== Relationships with educational institutions ===
In 2006, IIPM collaborated with Stanford University&#x27;s Center for Professional Development to organise a strategy workshop in New Delhi. In 2008, professors from the National University of Singapore (NUS) conducted a seven-week course on investment banking at the institute for its top 100 students, leading to a joint certification in investment banking. In the same year, IIPM launched a global executive management programme with Chicago GSB and the Haas School of Business associated with it. , NUS was conducting workshops on business-related topics in Singapore for IIPM students. Between 2009 and 2012, Singapore&#x27;s Nanyang Technological University sent students to the institute for a four-week course about Indian culture and economy.

, IIPM claimed that its global partners were: NYU Stern (for International Residency), Imperial College (participating B-school), Haas School of Business (Strategic Marketing Programme), McCombs School of Business (Affiliate B-school), Cornell University ILR School (Participating school for GOTA), National University of Singapore (Wealth management programme) and Nanyang Technological University. IIPM lists Judge School of Business (Cambridge University), Darden School of Business (University of Virginia) and SDA Bocconi School of Management as past partner institutions. The Mercator School of Management of Duisburg-Essen University has a formal partnership with IIPM for exchanging students and faculty, and jointly conducting research.

==Relationship with accreditation organisations==
The certifications offered directly by IIPM are not accredited by AICTEa regulating body for technical education in India whose accreditation is a voluntary process. According to IIPM, its courses do not come under the purview of AIU, AICTE, UGC and similar government-established regulatory bodies. The Supreme Court of India agreed in 2019 that AICTE has no jurisdiction over MBA education.

===History===
In 2005, the acting chairman of UGC, Prof V N Rajshekharan Pillai, said that IIPM&#x27;s advertisements could be misleading. In June 2008, the Delhi High Court advised the UGC and IIPM to settle the matter amicably through an out-of-court settlement. According to the institute, it had not sought &quot;de jure&quot; recognition from any statutory body or accrediting authority. UGC and AICTE listed IIPM as a &quot;fake university&quot; and said it was not permitted to confer MBA and BBA degrees or authorised to operate as a university in India. IIPM filed a lawsuit in response. In June 2008, UGC and IIPM reached an agreement in the Delhi High Court. UGC agreed to remove IIPM&#x27;s name from its list of fake universities and IIPM agreed to clarify that it offers only &quot;certificate courses&quot;.

The institute says it is an academically independent and autonomous body without affiliation to any university and its programs do not fall under the purview of AIU, AICTE, UGC, or similar government-established regulatory bodies. The Uttarakhand University Registrar in February 2010 said that IIPM was running MBA and BBA degree programs without UGC and AICTE affiliations and that IIPM&#x27;s continuing operation would be detrimental to institutions that operate with affiliations.

In July 2010, UGC issued a notice to IIPM after the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education questioned IIPM on the authenticity of its courses at its Hyderabad campus. UGC Chairman Ved Prakash said that IIPM was advertising its programs using the names of UGC, HRD Ministry and AICTE, and that &quot;it is indulging in cheating.&quot; IIPM Group President for Corporate Affairs Amit Saxena said the institute was not a university, was not empowered to award degrees on its own and was doing neither, and that IIPM was &quot;on-site academic partner of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University which grants its degrees to IIPM students.&quot; Saxena also said that IIPM had made representations to UGC and Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education to clarify its position and that the subject was sub judice at the Delhi High Court. The registrar of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University confirmed that IIPM was authorized to offer Manonmaniam Sundaranar University&#x27;s MBA/BBA programs in all of IIPM&#x27;s 18 branches. Students of IIPM&#x27;s Indian School of Business and Economics (ISBE) were informed by Manonmaniam Sundaranar University that theirs is a distance-learning degree arrangement.

In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India decided that AICTE has no jurisdiction over MBA education and that IIPM can conduct MBA education without AICTE&#x27;s permission.

==Controversies==
IIPM has been involved in controversies related to its claims about infrastructure, job placements and affiliation with international institutes. Journalists and independent bloggers have investigated IIPM&#x27;s claims in its newspaper advertising. IIPM denies these charges and has filed legal cases against some journalists. In February 2013, a district court in Gwalior passed an order asking India&#x27;s Department of Telecommunications to block access to 78 URLs critical of IIPM, which led to online protests. &quot;The Hindu&quot;″s editor wrote that an IIPM advertisement which stated that &quot;The Hindu&quot; had called the institute &quot;the B-School with a Human Face&quot; was &quot;illegal and unethical&quot;, and said that the quotation was the headline of a paid advertisement and &quot;The Hindu&quot; has not endorsed IIPM in any way. In December 2013, the Delhi High Court barred IIPM from publishing any TV, print or online advertisements without first obtaining the court&#x27;s approval, given that past IIPM advertisements had potentially misled the public.

===Conflicts with journalists===
In 2005, &quot;Outlook&quot;whose 2003 rankings IIPM had used in its advertisementsissued a statement withdrawing all rankings awarded to the institute, saying IIPM misguides students through unethical advertising practices and does not fully and truthfully disclose facts. According to Arindam Chaudhuri, this was done after he said that &quot;Outlook&quot; used the perception of qualitative rankings to influence business school rankings. IIPM responded with legal action against &quot;Outlook&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaudhuri/Sunday Indian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, an Indian online magazine called &quot;Just Another Magazine&quot; (JAM) published an article accusing IIPM of misleading students and the public with its advertisements by using institutional rankings published in 2003 which were no longer valid. The article said that the IIPM is not accredited by UGC or AICTE. After a court ruling, the article was removed from the internet. &quot;JAM&quot; editor Rashmi Bansal later published similar content in her blog. In response, IIPM called &quot;JAM&quot;″s statements an attempt to spread baseless rumours and filed a lawsuit against Bansal. In a court ruling in June 2010, Bansal was ordered to take down her blog article. Gaurav Sabnis, an IBM employee at that time, was forced to resign from his post after IIPM threatened to burn IBM laptops in front of IBM&#x27;s Delhi office.

Later, the magazine &quot;Careers 360&quot;published by Maheshwar Periinvestigated the case. IIPM again went to court against Peri and his publications &quot;Outlook&quot; and &quot;Careers 360&quot; on defamation charges. In 2010, Uttarakhand High Court quashed the case. Another magazine, &quot;The Caravan&quot;, published an article critical of IIPM in 2011 and is facing a legal challenge. In 2016, IIPM withdrew all remaining cases against Peri.

In 2009, Mahesh Sarma wrote in &quot;Careers 360&quot; that for the class of 2008, three companies mentioned in IIPM advertisements as participants in campus placement said that although some freshers of the institute may have been working for them, the companies had never participated in the institute&#x27;s campus recruitment process. Sarma profiled a sample of jobs that IIPM said its students obtained abroad in the Persian Gulf countries. As of June 2010, according to &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, Standard Chartered and Barclays were offering jobs to IIPM students.

In 2009, according to Sarma&#x27;s article, Judge Business School (University of Cambridge), Darden Graduate School of Business Administration (University of Virginia) and Haas School of Business hosted IIPM&#x27;s non-credit Executive Education program participants and conducted sessions for them. Sarma wrote that McCombs School of Business was not aware of a relationship with IIPM, and that IIPM may have a relationship with another University of Texas-Austin college. Judge Business School told Sarma that they were delivering a &quot;five-day non-degree executive education program&quot; to IIPM students at the University of Cambridge, and that &quot;there are no university qualifications awarded from Cambridge University or Judge Business School. The only certificate is a certificate of attendance which is what we provide to participants on all our programs.&quot; Darden Business School told Sarma that &quot;along with Cambridge (Judge) and UC Berkeley (Haas)&quot;, University of Virginia&#x27;s Darden School of Business was providing a series of week-long Executive Education non-credit programs for IIPM. Darden also said it had no partnership agreement with IIPM. Haas Business School confirmed the existence of a contract with IIPM and said that IIPM &quot;may represent itself as a business school participating with the Haas School of Business&quot;, and that Haas faculty will teach courses in the IIPM program.

Sarma also reported that the University of Buckingham had told him that although they were in talks with IIPM, there was no formal agreement yet and that until IIPM&#x27;s programs are formally accredited by the QAA, IIPM does not have consent to mention the University of Buckingham in its advertisements. According to Sarma, after &quot;Careers360&quot; published its article, IIPM removed the name of University of Buckingham from its advertisements.

Sarma said NVAOthe accreditation organization for Netherlands and Flanderssaid that IMI &quot;is not a recognized higher education institution in the Dutch or French speaking part of Belgium&quot; and cannot award recognized degrees. According to &quot;Careers 360&quot;, the Uttarakhand government appointed the registrar of Uttarakhand Technical University to conduct an inquiry; the registrar recommended banning IIPM.

===Wikipedia conflicts===
The IIPM reportedly used paid editors to doctor its article and those of its critics on the English Wikipedia, for promotional purposes. A Wikipedia user identified by the username was highly involved in such activity, monitoring the IIPM article to remove content that was critical of the institute. After gaining the trust of users, Wifione was also to the position of administrator, and used this new influence to continue these activities. It was also found that Wifione had used at least 60 &quot;sockpuppet&quot; accounts on the website to influence discussions in favor of modifications to the page that reflected the opinion of the IIPM. The effects of these strategies were magnified by the introduction of the Wikipedia Zero program, which offers free access to Wikipedia content on mobile phones in developing countries—including India. This program thus allowed users to discover the institute&#x27;s biased article. In February 2015, Wifione was banned from Wikipedia by the Arbitration Committee (ArbCom) for these actions.

==Litigation==
===2009===
IIPM filed a criminal defamation charge against &quot;Careers 360&quot;. However, all proceedings in the criminal complaint filed by IIPM against Careers360 was quashed by the Uttarakhand High Court by its judgement dated 8 October 2010. The Court noted that &quot;the sole purpose of the article was to caution gullible students. This court does not find anything defamatory in the article&quot;, and that IIPM could show &quot;no proof of their claim that they grant degree from Buckingham University!&quot;

===2013===
In December 2013, Livemint.com reported that public-interest litigation filed in 2010 by Mahesh Sarma, the editor of &quot;Careers 360&quot;, led to the Delhi High Court barring IIPM from publishing any TV, print or online advertisements without first obtaining the court&#x27;s approval, given that past IIPM advertisements had potentially misled the public. According to Livemint.com, the interim court order was based on an affidavit by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which stated that IIPM advertisements had the potential to &quot;mislead innocent students and public at large&quot;; a UGC committee investigating the issue had found that the &quot;practice of issuing such dubious advertisements by IIPM to attract students deceptively should be stopped forthwith&quot;. Portions of the UGC document were quoted in the interim court order.

===2014===
In September 2014, the Delhi High Court censured IIPM and its founder Arindam Chaudhuri for misleading students. A division bench restrained IIPM and its management with immediate effect from using the words &quot;MBA, BBA, management course, management school, business school or b-school&quot; in relation to the courses offered by it as well as in representations made to the public. The court noted that IIPM was promoting an impression that it had recognition from a foreign management institute, International Management Institute (IMI), Belgium. The court found that IMI had in fact been set up by Arindam Chaudhuri and his father Malay Chaudhuri, and was not even recognized by the laws of Belgium. The institute was also &quot;directed to prominently display on the website of IIPM that they are not recognized by any statutory body/authority&quot; and clarify the status of the foreign institutions from which students enrolling in IIPM would be getting a degree or certification

===2016===
In January 2016, IIPM withdrew all cases against Peri, chairman and chief executive of Careers360 when Peri sought to get all cases transferred to Supreme Court.
In another setback to IIPM, University Grants Commission issued a notice on their website informing general public that IIPM is not a university and is not entitled to confer various educational degrees.

=== 2019 ===
In September 2019, Kolkata High Court was hearing of a petition of two students who claimed to have been impressed by the IIPM ads featuring actor Shahrukh Khan giving them an impression of IIPM as a trustworthy institution. Following this the court has asked the actor for an explanation on his relationship and business dealings with IIPM. In response the actor&#x27;s lawyer denied claims in the petition and mentioned the actor had simply appeared in some ads for the institute. Meanwhile, the High court also questioned state government on why should the case have a CBI probe.

===Trade practices===
In May 2007, The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC)an anti-monopoly watchdoginitiated a probe into IIPM&#x27;s advertisements. They suspected that IIPM recovers the cost of GOTA tours and laptops, both advertised as free, from students later on. In October 2007, MRTPC announced that it would not be processing inquiries against business schools because of staff shortages.

===Tax issues===
In May 2007, S.S. Palanimanickam, Minister of State for Finance, answered a question in the Rajya Sabha raised by Dharam Pal Sabharwal, another Rajya Sabha member. Palanimanickam said, &quot;IIPM has not paid income tax during the assessment years 2005–06 and 2006–07, claiming exemption under section 10(23C) (vi) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.&quot; The ministry also said that IIPM had paid no service tax in the preceding two years. Under a query raised through the Right to Information Act on the institute, the Central Board of Direct Taxes said that the ministry received a &quot;tax evasion complaint in respect of wrong claims of exemption under Section 10(23C) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.&quot; In April 2009, the Indian government stated that there were &quot;no pending tax claims against IIPM&quot; and the case had been closed after due enquiry.

<text>Montague &quot;Monty&quot; Bodkin (also referred to as Montrose) is a recurring fictional character in three novels of English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being a wealthy young member of the Drones Club, well-dressed, well-spoken, impeccably polite, and generally in some kind of romantic trouble.

==Stories==
Monty is featured in:
* &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (1933) – a Blandings Castle novel
* &quot;The Luck of the Bodkins&quot; (1935)
* &quot;Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin&quot; (1972) – quoted as &quot;Montrose&quot; instead of &quot;Montague&quot;
Monty is mentioned in:
* &quot;Uncle Fred in the Springtime&quot; (1939) – Blandings
* &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; (1963) – Jeeves

==Life and character==
Monty Bodkin is the second-richest member of the Drones Club (the richest being Oofy Prosser). He is tall and slender, and has butter-coloured hair. The son of a solicitor with a small country-town practice, Monty inherited his money from an aunt who married an American millionaire from Pittsburgh when she was in the chorus of a musical at the Adelphi Theatre.

When we first meet Monty Bodkin at the start of &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;, he is employed by Lord Tilbury as assistant editor of &quot;Tiny Tots&quot;, one of the many imprints of the mighty Mammoth Publishing Company, his uncle Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe having prevailed upon Tilbury to give him the job at a public dinner. Monty does not work, however, because of any need for income; as he himself explains, there are &quot;wheels within wheels&quot;. He is in love with Gertrude Butterwick but her father, named J. G. Butterwick in this novel (it&#x27;ll evolve), feeling that his daughter should not marry some kind of a waster, requires Monty to hold down a job for a full year, and Gertrude, being an old-fashioned sort of girl of solid middle-class stock, refuses to elope with Monty.

His time at &quot;Tiny Tots&quot; is brief, however, as he finds himself left in charge one day when the regular editor, the Reverend Aubrey Sellick, is away on vacation. His efforts at writing a piece for the &quot;Uncle Woggly to His Chicks&quot; column results in a swift and acrimonious parting between Bodkin and Tilbury&#x27;s employ, and the hunt is on for new work. On the advice of his friend and fellow-Drone Hugo Carmody, he once again uses his uncle, this time to wangle the post of secretary to Lord Emsworth, recently vacated by Carmody. He spends a few happy days at Blandings, in company of his former fiancee Sue Brown, before events conspiring against him, particularly Lord Emsworth&#x27;s suspicions of anyone connected to the Parsloe-Parsloe camp, lead to his expulsion from the post. He tries to get back in with Lord Tilbury by stealing Galahad Threepwood&#x27;s reminiscences, but is scuppered by Percy Pilbeam; he later takes revenge on Pilbeam, but repents and ends up paying him handsomely for the chance to work for his Detective Agency, the &quot;Argus&quot;, for a year.

In &quot;The Plot That Thickened&quot; (American title for Pearls, Girls and Month Bodkin) Monty manages to hold down a job in the entertainment industry, only to be informed by J.G. Butterwick that it does not count. Surprising his fiancee&#x27;s father, he immediately secures a job with his former employer in England, thanks to the efforts of his secretary. Over the course of the book, he falls in love with said secretary, and marries her after Gertrude breaks the engagement to marry a police officer.

==Adaptations==

Royce Mills portrayed Monty Bodkin in the 1988 radio dramatisation of &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;, part of the &quot;Blandings&quot; radio series. In the 1995 TV adaptation of &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; made by the BBC and partners, also broadcast in the United States by PBS, and titled &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;, Monty Bodkin was played by Samuel West. Monty was portrayed by Nicholas Boulton in the 2000 BBC radio adaptation of &quot;The Luck of the Bodkins&quot;.

<text>The Senate Republican Policy Committee is the policy research arm of the Republican Conference. Its predecessor, the Senate Republican Steering Committee was formed in March 1944 after Leader Charles L. McNary&#x27;s death. It became formally funded and renamed the Policy Committee in 1947 along with its Democratic counterpart, the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, after the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. Funding for staff of both party policy committees comes directly from the legislative branch.

According to &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;, &quot;the Policy Committee is in effect a legislative think tank. The committee organizes the prominent Tuesday lunches with summaries of major bills, analysis of roll call votes and distribution of issue papers.&quot;

<text>Reason maintenance is a knowledge representation approach to efficient handling of inferred information that is explicitly stored. Reason maintenance distinguishes between base facts, which can be defeated, and derived facts. As such it differs from belief revision which, in its basic form, assumes that all facts are equally important. Reason maintenance was originally developed as a technique for implementing problem solvers. It encompasses a variety of techniques that share a common architecture: two components—a reasoner and a reason maintenance system—communicate with each other via an interface. The reasoner uses the reason maintenance system to record its inferences and justifications of (&quot;reasons&quot; for) the inferences. The reasoner also informs the reason maintenance system which are the currently valid base facts (assumptions). The reason maintenance system uses the information to compute the truth value of the stored derived facts and to restore consistency if an inconsistency is derived.

A truth maintenance system, or TMS, is a knowledge representation method for representing both beliefs and their dependencies and an algorithm called the &quot;truth maintenance algorithm&quot; that manipulates and maintains the dependencies. The name &quot;truth maintenance&quot; is due to the ability of these systems to restore consistency. 

A truth maintenance system maintains consistency between old believed knowledge and current believed knowledge in the knowledge base (KB) through revision. If the current believed statements contradict the knowledge in the KB, then the KB is updated with the new knowledge. It may happen that the same data will again be believed, and the previous knowledge will be required in the KB. If the previous data are not present, but may be required for new inference. But if the previous knowledge was in the KB, then no retracing of the same knowledge is needed. The use of TMS avoids such retracing; it keeps track of the contradictory data with the help of a dependency record. This record reflects the retractions and additions which makes the inference engine (IE) aware of its current belief set.

Each statement having at least one valid justification is made a part of the current belief set. When a contradiction is found, the statement(s) responsible for the contradiction are identified and the records are appropriately updated. This process is called dependency-directed backtracking.

The TMS algorithm maintains the records in the form of a dependency network. Each node in the network is an entry in the KB (a premise, antecedent, or inference rule etc.) Each arc of the network represent the inference steps through which the node was derived.

A premise is a fundamental belief which is assumed to be true. They do not need justifications. The set of premises are the basis from which justifications for all other nodes will be derived.

There are two types of justification for a node. They are:

# Support list [SL]
# Conditional proof (CP)

Many kinds of truth maintenance systems exist. Two major types are single-context and multi-context truth maintenance. In single context systems, consistency is maintained among all facts in memory (KB) and relates to the notion of consistency found in classical logic. Multi-context systems support paraconsistency by allowing consistency to be relevant to a subset of facts in memory, a context, according to the history of logical inference. This is achieved by tagging each fact or deduction with its logical history. Multi-agent truth maintenance systems perform truth maintenance across multiple memories, often located on different machines. de Kleer&#x27;s assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS, 1986) was utilized in systems based upon KEE on the Lisp Machine. The first multi-agent TMS was created by Mason and Johnson. It was a multi-context system. Bridgeland and Huhns created the first single-context multi-agent system.
