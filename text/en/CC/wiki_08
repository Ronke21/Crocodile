<text>Polyphagia or hyperphagia is an abnormally strong, sensation of hunger or desire to eat often leading to overeating. In contrast to an increase in appetite following exercise, polyphagia does not subside after eating and often leads to rapid intake of excessive quantities of food. Polyphagia is not a disorder by itself; rather, it is a symptom indicating an underlying medical condition. It is frequently a result of abnormal blood glucose levels (both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia), and, along with polydipsia and polyuria, it is one of the &quot;3 Ps&quot; commonly associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;polyphagia&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, from the Greek words πολύς (polys), &quot;very much&quot; or &quot;many&quot;, and φᾰ́γω (phago), &quot;eating&quot; or &quot;devouring&quot;.

== Underlying conditions and possible causes ==
Polyphagia is one of the most common symptoms of diabetes mellitus. It is associated with hyperthyroidism and endocrine diseases, e.g., Graves&#x27; disease, and it has also been noted in Prader–Willi syndrome and other genetic conditions caused by chromosomal anomalies. It is only one of several diagnostic criteria for bulimia and is not by itself classified as an eating disorder. As a symptom of Kleine–Levin syndrome, it is sometimes termed megaphagia.

Knocking out vagal nerve receptors has been shown to cause hyperphagia.

Changes in hormones associated with the female menstrual cycle can lead to extreme hunger right before the period. Spikes in estrogen and progesterone and decreased serotonin can lead to cravings for carbohydrates and fats.

Polyphagia is found in the following conditions:

* Chromosome 22q13 duplication syndrome
* Chromosome 2p25.3 deletion (MYT1L Syndrome)
* Chromosome Xq26.3 duplication syndrome
* Congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1
* Congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 2
* Diabetes mellitus type 1
* Familial renal glucosuria
* Frontotemporal dementia
* Frontotemporal dementia, ubiquitin-positive
* Graves&#x27; disease
* Hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome
* Kleine–Levin syndrome
* Leptin deficiency or dysfunction
* Leptin receptor deficiency
* Luscan-Lumish syndrome
* Macrosomia adiposa congenita
* Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 1
* Obesity, hyperphagia, and developmental delay (OBHD)
* Pick&#x27;s disease
* Prader–Willi syndrome
* Proopiomelanocortin deficiency
* Schaaf-yang syndrome

== Polyphagia in diabetes ==
Diabetes mellitus causes a disruption in the body&#x27;s ability to transfer glucose from food into energy. Polyphagia in type 2 diabetes is usually not as apparent as the polyphagia in type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, it probably results from cellular starvation and the depletion of cellular stores of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

<doc id="846857" wikidata="Q4633382" url="?curid=846857" title="2 Squadron SAAF">
<text>2 Squadron is a squadron in the South African Air Force which was formed in 1940. The squadron has a long history, having been involved in every single combat action in which the SAAF has taken part. During the Second World War it made a name for itself in the battles for East Africa, before distinguishing itself in North Africa as part of the Desert Air Force, and later in Italy.

==World War II==
The squadron was established on 1 October 1940, when the two flights of 1 Squadron SAAF that were operating in Kenya against the Italians in the East African campaign, were formed into a new squadron. The Kenya-based flights had operated independently from the remainder of 1 Squadron, based in the Sudan for several months, and two shootdowns of Italian aircraft made by the Kenya-based flights were retrospectively credited to the new squadron. Initial equipment of the new squadron was nine Hawker Furys fighters, nine Gloster Gladiators and five Hawker Hurricanes. In November, the Squadron&#x27;s Gladiators were transferred to 1 Squadron SAAF, and on 3 January 1941, its Hurricanes were also passed to 1 Squadron SAAF, leaving 2 Squadron equipped with Furys, supplemented by three old Gloster Gauntlets inherited from 430 Flight RAF. In March 1941, the squadron was planned to re-equip with Curtiss Mohawk IV fighters, but when the new aircraft were delivered to Mombassa their engines proved to be faulty, and had to be sent to Britain for repair. On 17 April the squadron&#x27;s pilots were sent off to Egypt where the squadron would be re-equipped for service in the Western Desert campaign. The squadron claimed eight Italian aircraft shot down during the East African campaign.

On arrival in Egypt, the squadron received Hurricanes as temporary equipment until it could convert to its planned equipment of Curtiss Tomahawks. A detachment of the squadron&#x27;s Hurricanes operated over the front from Sidi Haneish Airfield from the end of May while the rest of the squadron continued to work up on Tomahawks. By July 1941, it had fully converted to and was operational on the Tomahawk. 

During the initial years of the war, 2 Squadron served as part of 1 Bomber Brigade in the East African campaign and the North African campaign. After August 1943, it also saw action in Sicily, Italy and Yugoslavia.

During the Second World War the squadron operated the following aircraft:
* Hawker Hartebeest
* Hawker Fury I
* Gloster Gauntlet
* Gloster Gladiator II
* Hawker Hurricane
* Tomahawk IIB June 1941 – May 1942
* Kittyhawk I April 1942 – June 1943
* Kittyhawk III June 1943 – July 1943
* Supermarine Spitfire Vc July 1943 – March 1944
* Supermarine Spitfire IX February 1944 – July 1945
==Korean War==

The squadron was South Africa&#x27;s contribution to the United Nations war effort during the Korean War from November 1950 to December 1953.
2 Squadron was attached to the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing U.S. Air Force for the duration of the war. Initially flying the P-51 Mustang, the squadron re-equipped with the F-86 Sabre in February 1953. During the war the squadron flew a total of 12,067 sorties, most being dangerous ground attack missions. 74 of the 94 Mustangs and 4 out of the 22 Sabres were lost, along with 33 pilots (14 killed in action, 11 missing in action, 8 killed in accidents).
* 
For its actions, the squadron received the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation, United States Presidential Unit Citation, and numerous other awards and decorations.
The Commanding Officer of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing, issued a directive at the end of the war that:

Eleven Korean War SAAF casualties are buried at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery, Busan, South Korea.

After the Korean War 2 Squadron, based at Waterkloof AFB, was equipped with Canadair CL-13 Sabres. For a period the squadron was stationed at AFB Pietersburg.

==The Border War and post 2000==

Conversion to the new Mirage III occurred in 1963 and the squadron moved to AFB Hoedspruit at the end of 1978. The squadron fought in several engagements during the South-West Africa/Angola Border War.

They continued to fly the Mirages until October 1990. They later re-equipped with the Atlas Cheetah C and D, but remained &#x27;on the books&#x27; during the hiatus between Mirage and Cheetah, not being officially disbanded at that point. Reconnaissance was also performed using Vinten Vicon 18 Series 601 pod. Regular night flying was performed and the aircrew also performed air-to-air refuelling operations with the Boeing 707 aircraft of 60 Squadron, until these were retired in 2007. The squadron participated in the annual SANDF force preparation exercises which includes using live weapons. During joint exercises with the German Air Force in 2006, 40 live V3S &quot;Snake&quot; short-range air-to-air missiles were fired at the Denel Overberg Test Range.

Moving to Louis Trichardt (now AFB Makhado) in January 1993, 2 Squadron became the sole front line combat jet squadron in the SAAF.
Till 2 April 2008 the squadron operated the Cheetah C/D fighter aircraft and was equipped with 28 examples. The squadron flew 1010 hours in 2004.

The last of the Cheetahs were retired on 2 April 2008, later that month the first new JAS 39 Gripen arrived. The SAAF accepted its first Gripen D in April 2008 and the final two Gripen D aircraft arrived in South Africa in July 2009. The first two Gripen Cs arrived on 11 February 2010 with deliveries ongoing as at October 2011. The squadron operates all the SAAF&#x27;s Gripens except for the first Gripen D, which is assigned to the Test Flight and Development Centre at AFB Overberg.
==Aircraft operated 1945–present==

<text>The Schweriner Fernsehturm is a 136.5-metre-tall communications tower built of steel-concrete between 1960 and 1964 in Schwerin, Germany. Unlike most other TV towers, the ground plan is a spherical triangle and not a cylindric cross section. Also its tower basket, which also contains a restaurant, has no round form, but looks instead like a triangle with round sides. From 1991 to November 28, 1999, the restaurant was closed. In the neighbourhood of this tower at 53°35&#x27;30,98&quot; N and 11°27&#x27;19,8&quot; E, there is a 273-metre-high, radio mast for FM-radio and TV.

<doc id="846861" wikidata="Q5728882" url="?curid=846861" title="Henry Dudley (conspirator)">
<text>Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Dudley (1517–1568) was an English Admiral, soldier, diplomat, and conspirator of the Tudor period.

==Early life and family==
Born in Dudley Castle, Staffordshire, Henry Dudley was the second son of John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley. His mother was Cicely, a daughter of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquis of Dorset. Dudley was the first cousin of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane Grey, the second cousin once removed of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and the second cousin of Elizabeth I through their mutual great grandmother, Elizabeth Woodville. He is not to be confused with the youngest of Northumberland&#x27;s sons, also named Henry Dudley, who married Margaret, the daughter of Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley.

==Early career==
Dudley became a monastic auditor under Thomas Cromwell in 1535, and then a soldier serving in Ireland under his uncle Leonard Grey in 1536, and in Scotland from 1540–3. Dudley fought gallantly during the siege of Boulogne in 1544, and was made a Captain early in 1545 under Lord Clinton.

==Promotion and imprisonment==
He was promoted to Admiral of the Narrow Seas March 1552 when Lord Clinton was Lord High Admiral, and knighted at Hampton Court on 11 October 1551. A close associate of his second cousin, the Duke of Northumberland, he was arrested on 25 July 1553 at Calais. The duke had sent him to France around 13 July 1553 to confer with King Henry II regarding French support in the event of an Imperial intervention in England. According to Simon Renard and Hugues Cousin le Vieux, it was said that Henry Dudley had taken numerous jewels and rings from the royal treasury to reward potential supporters. Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London, but pardoned by Queen Mary on 18 October 1553.

==Visit to Paris==
Henry Dudley, having once been Captain of the Guard at Boulogne had many friends in France and in December 1555 visited Paris, where he was curiously well received by King Henry II. Although Dudley returned home with only the vaguest of assurances, even Pope Paul was ill-disposed toward the English Queen Mary because of her marriage into the powerful Habsburg family and that same month signed a secret treaty with Henry II against Spanish dominion.

==Conspiracy begins==
Henry Dudley and his agents moved in January, to conceal stores of ammunition at strategic locations, and also secluded an amount of money totalling fifty thousand pounds, previously withdrawn and removed from the Exchequer, (where Dudley was a familiar visitor and had a number of friends), &quot;in water by (London) bridge&quot; to make ready for an invasion planned to be executed by mercenaries and exiles. The money was to be sent to France where his Protestant exile supporters would follow the initiative through.

In Spain, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor abdicated on 16 January 1556, whereupon Philip and Mary became King and Queen of Spain, which at the time held the Netherlands. Philip had received a letter confirming that given the mood of the English Parliament even down to the people discontent was such that there was scant chance of him also being crowned in England at the same time or in the near future.

==Organizes invasion force==
Sir Henry Dudley had returned to France, and by March was engaged in the raising of an invasion force, with the intention of landing it on the Isle of Wight, to march on London. Had the plot not been discovered, its intention was to remove Mary to exile in Spain where she could be happily reunited with King Philip and to bring about the succession of Elizabeth to the English throne. Bold and righteous as it was, it proved too daring for most of the English gentry, who failed to lend it their support, &quot;feebly, but not without some expectation, waiting for time to dispatch the evil Queen&quot;.

It was Henry Dudley who now took the initiative; while greater noblemen trembled, Dudley was abroad organising a widespread and sophisticated rebellion. Amongst his agents was the courtier and MP Henry Peckham, the son of Sir Edmund Peckham, then Master of the Tower Mint and a member of the Royal Council. Henry Peckham was detected in the plan to obtain funds by robbing the Exchequer and he soon found himself a prisoner of the Tower. In July 1556 he and his assistants were &quot;hanged on the gallows of Tower Hill for treason against the queen ... and after cut down, beheaded and their bodies carried unto London Bridge and there set up and their bodies buried at Allhallows, Barking.&quot;

==Plot dissolves==
It appears that once revealed the plot dissolved and Henry Dudley remained at large in France, his great scheme undermined by careless talk and too unwieldy an organisation. He was consequently to become an exile in the French service between 1556 and 1563, but was again to return home and serve as &quot;Capt. Dudley&quot; in 1563, receiving an annuity later the same year from Queen Elizabeth for his service. In 1567 he obtained from Elizabeth some protection from his creditors that was extended to 1568. Sir Henry died between 1568 and 1570, but no will is known to exist.

<text>Walter Owen Bentley, (16 September 1888 – 13 August 1971) was an English engineer who founded Bentley in London. He was a motorcycle and car racer as a young man. After making a name for himself as a designer of aircraft and automobile engines, Bentley established his own firm in 1919. He built the firm into one of the world&#x27;s premier luxury and performance auto manufacturers, and led the marque to multiple victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. After selling his namesake company to Rolls-Royce in 1931, he was employed as a designer for Lagonda, Aston Martin and Armstrong Siddeley.

==Early life==

Bentley was born on 16 September 1888, in Hampstead, London. He was the youngest of nine children. His father Alfred Bentley was a retired businessman and his mother Emily (née Waterhouse) was born in Adelaide, Australia. As the son of a prosperous family he was privately educated at Clifton College in Bristol from 1902 until 1905, when at the age of 16 he left to start work as an apprentice engineer with the Great Northern Railway at Doncaster Works.

===Locomotives===

The five-year premium apprenticeship with the Great Northern, which cost his father £75, taught Bentley to design complex railway machinery and also gave him practical experience in the technical procedures to cast, manufacture, and build it. He later recalled: &quot;The sight of one of Patrick Stirling&#x27;s eight-foot singles could move me profoundly.&quot; While with the Great Northern, he came close to realising his childhood ambition to drive one of their Atlantic express locomotives, when at the end of his apprenticeship he acquired footplate experience as a second fireman on main-line expresses. &quot;My longest day&quot;, he said, &quot;was London to Leeds and back, on the return journey doing Wakefield to King&#x27;s Cross non-stop for 175 miles. This was a total day&#x27;s run of 400 miles, entailing a consumption of about seven tons of coal, every pound of it to be shovelled. Not a bad day&#x27;s exercise.&quot; He completed his apprenticeship in the summer of 1910 but decided that the railways did not offer him enough scope for a satisfying career.

===Motorcycles===
In 1909 and 1910 Bentley raced Quadrant, Rex, and Indian motorcycles. He competed in two Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races, on a Rex in 1909 and as a member of Indian&#x27;s factory team in 1910. He did not finish in either event; in 1910, his Indian&#x27;s rear tyre burst on the second lap.

===Theoretical engineering study, taxi company employment===
After he studied theoretical engineering at King&#x27;s College London, he took employment with the National Motor Cab Company, where his several duties included overseeing the maintenance of the fleet&#x27;s 250 Unics. He was fascinated by the cabbies&#x27; ingenuity at fiddling the meters.

===Entering the automobile industry===
In 1912 he joined his brother, Horace Millner Bentley, in a company called &quot;Bentley and Bentley&quot; that sold French Doriot, Flandrin &amp; Parant cars. Dissatisfied with the performance of the DFPs, but convinced that success in competition was the best marketing for them, Bentley was inspired by a paperweight to have pistons made for the engine in aluminium alloy. Fitted with the alloy pistons and a modified camshaft, a DFP took several records at Brooklands in 1913 and 1914.

===Aero engines===

At the outbreak of World War I, Bentley knew that using aluminium alloy pistons in military applications would benefit the national interest: they improved power output and ran cooler, allowing higher compression ratios and higher engine speeds. As security considerations prevented his broadcasting the information to engine manufacturers, he contacted the official liaison between the manufacturers and the Navy. That man, Commander Wilfred Briggs, would be his senior officer throughout the war.

Commissioned in the Royal Naval Air Service, Bentley was sent to share with manufacturers the knowledge and experience he had gained from the modifications to the engines of the DFP cars he sold in Britain. Following his first consultation, which was with the future Lord Hives at Rolls-Royce, the company&#x27;s first aero engine, named the &quot;Eagle&quot;, was designed with pistons of aluminium instead of cast-iron or steel. Bentley next visited Louis Coatalen at Sunbeam, with the result that the same innovation was used in all their aero engines.

Bentley also visited Gwynnes, whose Chiswick factory made French Clerget engines under licence, and he liaised between the squadrons in France and Gwynnes&#x27; engineering staff. When they proved unwilling to implement Bentley&#x27;s more important suggestions the Navy gave him a team to design his own aero engine at the Humber factory in Coventry. Designated the BR1, &quot;Bentley Rotary 1&quot;, the engine was fundamentally different from the Clerget except in the design of the cam mechanism, which was retained to facilitate production. A prototype was running in the early summer of 1916. The bigger BR2 followed in early 1918.

In recognition, Bentley was awarded the MBE. After he was invited in 1920 to make a claim, which the Clerget licensees contested unsuccessfully, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors awarded him £8,000.

==Bentley Motors==

After the war, in early 1919, Bentley founded Bentley in small premises in London with Frank Burgess (formerly of Humber) and Harry Varley (formerly of Vauxhall). Clive Gallop joined the team as an engine designer to help develop their straight-4 engine. The 3-litre engine ran for the first time in New Street Mews, Baker Street, London. A plaque marks the building in what is now Chagford Street. Bentley&#x27;s first complete Bentley 3 Litre car began road tests in January 1920 and the first production version, made in Cricklewood, was delivered in September 1921. Its durability earned widespread acclaim.

Bentley&#x27;s motto was &quot;To build a good car, a fast car, the best in class.&quot; His cars raced in hill climbs and at Brooklands, and the lone 3 Litre entered by the company in the 1922 Indianapolis 500 mile race and driven by Douglas Hawkes finished thirteenth at an average speed of 74.95 mph. Bentley entered a team of his new 3-litre modified and race-prepared cars in the 1922 Tourist Trophy, driving himself in Bentley III; the only team to finish, they received the Team Award, thereby launching Bentley&#x27;s reputation; Jean Chassagne (later himself a &#x27;Bentley Boy&#x27;) on a 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam winning outright. Bentleys set many records at the Le Mans 24-hour races, with &quot;Bentley Boy&quot; Woolf Barnato the only driver to win all three times he entered.

In 1923, when a rather sceptical Bentley was persuaded to attend the inaugural Le Mans race, he saw John Duff and Frank Clement&#x27;s private entry take fourth place.

A Bentley 3 Litre won at Le Mans in 1924. Neither of the two Bentleys entered in the 1925 race finished it, but subsequent models won again in 1927, 1928, 1929, and 1930, with the factory team managed by Bentley&#x27;s old school friend Richard Sidney Witchell. Ettore Bugatti is said to have commented that Bentley made &quot;the fastest lorries in the world&quot;.

With Bentley Motors Ltd. in financial difficulties, and the company&#x27;s board of directors critical of Bentley, Kimberley diamond magnate Barney Barnato&#x27;s heir Woolf Barnato purchased the business&#x27;s assets and became chairman. 
Bentley continued his design work as Barnato&#x27;s employee. The racing version of the Bentley designed six-cylinder Speed Six—the road car was introduced in 1928—proved to be the most successful Bentley in competition, and won Le Mans in 1929 and 1930. In 1929, against Bentley&#x27;s wishes, Barnato approved the development of a supercharged, &quot;Blower&quot; version of the 1927 4½ Litre. Tim Birkin&#x27;s brainchild, the car was made in separate, purpose-built workshops, away from Bentley, in Welwyn Garden City. As Bentley had feared, durability proved poor and the car failed on the track.

Although Barnato continued racing Bentleys with distinction, and even though the company sold a hundred of its 8 Litre model, which was launched as a grand car for the ultra-rich in October 1930 (Bugatti sold three of his equivalent model, the Royale), the Great Depression took its toll.

By July 1931 Barnato&#x27;s financial support had dwindled, and Bentley Motors went into voluntary liquidation. On 10 July a Receiver was appointed to the company. Bentley&#x27;s cars had accumulated losses of £136,220 and had worked through three fortunes including Barnato&#x27;s.

Napier &amp; Son entered negotiations as prospective purchasers. 
Cricklewood production

* 506 of the 3-litre cars were &#x27;Speed Models&#x27; and 15 &#x27;100 mph Models&#x27;
* 54 of the -litre cars were supercharged
* 171 of the short-chassis -litre cars were &#x27;Speed Sixes&#x27;

==Rolls-Royce Limited, Derby==

However it was arch rival Rolls-Royce who bought the company, topping Napier&#x27;s bid at the last minute and announcing the acquisition on 20 November 1931. Rolls-Royce had been disturbed by the 8 Litre&#x27;s encroachment upon the market segment of their Phantom II. Rolls-Royce&#x27;s agents had posed as the British Equitable central trust to avoid alerting Napier and inflating the price. The old business had not troubled to register their Bentley trademark. Rolls-Royce took immediate steps to remedy that. Cricklewood was closed during 1932. Thereafter production was from Rolls-Royce premises in Derby and, postwar, Crewe.

Rolls-Royce had acquired the Bentley showrooms in Cork Street, the service station at Kingsbury, the whole establishment at Cricklewood and Bentley himself. This last was disputed by Napier in court without success. Everything was sold but some 8-litre chassis which were taken to Derby. The name alone was to be kept and used for a smaller economy car but that prototype proved to be as complex and expensive as the bigger Rolls-Royces and its development was halted.

Bentley believed Barnato had bought a substantial shareholding in Rolls-Royce just before pulling out his support while visiting New York. Barnato was invited to become a director of the new Rolls-Royce subsidiary, Bentley Motors (1931) Limited.

Bentley&#x27;s winter of 1931/1932 was hard, his wife divorced him and he lost any form of personal transport, when he was asked to return his personal Bentley 8 Litre. Hearing of this William Rootes arranged for him to test a new Hillman each weekend.

===Lock-out===
As obliged to do by the court he joined Rolls-Royce under a contract extending from 1 May 1932 to the end of April 1935. Rolls-Royce isolated him in London and Europe, keeping him occupied as liaison between customers and—at long range—the works, to test drive vehicles at Brooklands and for long test runs across the Continent and the Alps.

While he worked on testing the prototype he was only permitted to comment on the design of what would become the new Derby -litre announced in October 1933. Around that time he managed to begin to report in person to the design teams at Derby making friends in the process, among them Harry Grylls and Stewart Tresilian who did some design-only work on a short-stroke replacement for the V12 engine for their Phantom III. Bentley had been effectively sequestered from the design team of the new car bearing his own name, but he did admire their achievement.

Rolls-Royce promoted its new line of Bentleys as &quot;The Silent Sports Car&quot;. Bentley left Rolls-Royce at the end of April 1935 with a sense of freedom.

==Lagonda, Staines, Middlesex==

A Lagonda M45R Rapide with a Meadows engine won the 1935 Le Mans 24-hour race, and a week later Lagonda was saved from receivership by Alan P Good. Bentley joined the new board as Technical Director and moved to Lagonda with the majority of Rolls-Royce&#x27;s racing department staff. Bentley again went racing. Unable to persuade Harry Grylls to join his engineering staff at Staines, Bentley obtained Stewart Tresilian&#x27;s services from February 1936. Tresilian brought Frank Stark and Reg Ingham with him and Donald Bastow joined them.
Bentley made Tresilian chief designer of the V12 project, and the engine was launched in 1937. Displacing 4480 cc, it delivered 180 bhp (134 kW) and was said to be capable of going from 7 to 105 mph in top gear and revving to 5000 rpm. Tresilian left in early 1938 for a Hawker Siddeley subsidiary. Development of the V12 was not complete but Lagonda&#x27;s financial difficulties prompted more staff to leave.

The car was exhibited at the 1939 New York Motor Show. The &quot;New York Times&quot; commented: &quot;The highest price car in the show this year is tagged $8,900. It is a Lagonda, known as the &quot;Rapide&quot; model, imported from England. The power plant is a twelve-cylinder V engine developing 200 horsepower.&quot;

During the war Bentley worked on armaments at Lagonda. Towards the end of the war he began work on a new straight-6 engine, as it was clear that the V12 would be seen as too extravagant for the postwar market. The team developed a modern dual overhead cam straight-6 engine with an initial displacement of 2.6 L (2580 cc/157 in3). With a 78 mm (3.07 in) bore and 90 mm (3.543 in) stroke, it produced about 105 hp (78 kW) with dual SU carburettors. It would not reach the market until 1948.

Due to a shortage of materials, the Ministry of Supply, whose wartime controls over the allocation of steel would remain in force from 1945 to 1954, had allocated Lagonda the steel for only 100 cars. Although the Ministry&#x27;s controls were intended to maintain supply to existing manufacturers, they were applied unevenly—while Lagonda had tooled up for quantity production and provided evidence of a substantial export order book, David Brown&#x27;s companies were able to obtain the steel they required. One consequence of the controls was that aluminium was used in the construction of Land Rovers, winning them an unintended reputation for not rusting.

In August, 1947, J. R. Greenwood, Chairman of Lagonda, announced that although work had begun on the first 1,000 of the new Bentley-designed -litre cars, the project had been cancelled owing to continuing production difficulties and the recently imposed double purchase tax. While Lagonda would continue with its other engineering activities, including the manufacture of a diesel-powered pile-driver, the company notified its 1,600 workers that some of them would inevitably become redundant.

==David Brown, Feltham, Middlesex==
A month later, in mid-September it was announced that the Lagonda specification had been bought by David Brown &amp; Sons (Huddersfield) Limited, gear-wheel manufacturer, which would combine production with Aston Martin bought earlier that year.

Production was moved to Feltham, Middlesex.

Brown had purchased Lagonda largely to gain Bentley&#x27;s engineering expertise, and immediately placed Bentley &#x27;s newest creation, his 2.6-litre Lagonda Straight-6 engine, under the bonnet of Brown&#x27;s other new acquisition, the Frank Feeley-designed DB2. This durable DOHC engine would continue in Lagondas and Aston Martins until 1959 and, Bentley noted, important design details were carried on through to their V8.

==Armstrong Siddeley==
Bentley moved from Aston Martin-Lagonda to Armstrong Siddeley, where he designed another twin-overhead-cam 3-litre engine before retiring. His team included Donald Bastow. According to one report the team&#x27;s responsibility for the Sapphire project extended to the car&#x27;s chassis, but by the time their work ended in 1949 they had contributed little more than detailed inspiration for the production version of the car that was announced in October 1952. Although Bentley&#x27;s particular engine design was judged too costly for production, it was because of his involvement that the final Sapphire product received the respect of contemporary designers.
==Personal life==
Bentley married three times. In 1914 he married Leonie Gore, daughter of Sir St George Ralph Gore, ninth baronet of Magherabegg. She died in 1919, in the Spanish flu epidemic. In 1920 Bentley married Poppy (Audrey Hutchinson) (1895-1981), a fun-loving society woman who disliked factories, whereas Bentley was said to love spending time in the workshop. They divorced soon after the business was sold in 1931. In 1934 he married Margaret Roberts Hutton, née Murray, who survived him. He had no children.

At the time of his death on Friday 13 August 1971, shortly before his 83rd birthday, in Woking, Surrey, Bentley was the patron of The Bentley Drivers&#x27; Club. Margaret died in 1989.

Bentley was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Obituaries==
Following his lengthy obituary printed in &quot;The Times&quot; on 16 August 1971 the same newspaper printed two more contributions.

:&quot; . . . In the eyes of those who own, have owned, or aspire to own, one of the 3,040 Bentley cars designed and built by the &#x27;old&#x27; Bentley company under the leadership of &quot;W. O.&quot; he was admired and respected—indeed, I think, loved is not too strong a word—for to know his cars was to know him. During his working life &quot;W. O.&quot; suffered a series of ups and downs which might have broken a lesser man. It certainly marked him and it was a disillusioned &quot;W. O.&quot; I first met 25 years ago [1946]. . . . &quot;W. O.&quot; has said that the pleasure he derived in the post-war years from Club activities; from making new friends among its members; and from seeing the loving care bestowed upon &#x27;his&#x27; cars has more than compensated for all his earlier disappointments.&quot; S. S.

:&quot;The six years during which I worked for &quot;W. O.&quot; were a period of education and pleasure. His modesty, lack of pretension, mental honesty and reasonableness endeared him to those in contact with him, and his over-riding interest in the improvement of the car provided the education in a period which included the post-war -litre Lagonda development, schemes for 4 and 8 cylinder derivatives, for the pursuit of shorter strokes in engines, for a small transverse-engined front wheel drive car and for a performance engine for the Morris Minor in place of the 850cc side valve engine it then endured.

:Though normally of reflective habit his experience showed him when swift action was necessary, and he could be very determined in pursuing it. Big enough to admit mistakes when they had occurred, he also knew when to modify and when to start afresh in remedying them.

:It is a pity that circumstances prevented his influence on car development from being greater than it was. Though motoring and motor cars were his life he retained a keen interest in locomotives.&quot; Mr Donald Bastow.

==The Bentley Drivers&#x27; Club==
Woolf Barnato (1895–1948) served a term as president. Bentley agreed to become patron in 1947. Founded in 1936 the club now has nearly 4,000 members throughout the United Kingdom, Europe, US, Canada, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

A new website was set up, www.wobentley.club, that contains the archive of all current data related to known (and unknown) Bentleys in existence, with photographs and documents about each car&#x27;s history.

<text>Villa Borghese is a landscape garden in Rome, containing a number of buildings, museums (see Galleria Borghese) and attractions. It is the third-largest public park in Rome (80 hectares or 197.7 acres), after the ones of the Villa Doria Pamphili and Villa Ada. The gardens were developed for the Villa Borghese Pinciana (&quot;Borghese villa on the Pincian Hill&quot;), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese, who used it as a &quot;villa suburbana&quot;, or party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection. The gardens as they are now were remade in the late 19th century.

==History==
In 1605 Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul V and patron of Bernini, began turning this former vineyard into the most extensive gardens built in Rome since Antiquity. The vineyard&#x27;s site is identified with the gardens of Lucullus, the most famous in the late Roman republic. Domenico Savino da Montepulciano was responsible for the layout of the gardens.

The Borghese Balustrade was crafted by G di Gincome and P. Massoni in 1618 for the south forecourt of the &quot;Casino Nobile&quot;. At the center opening there were two stone statues on top and fountains with shell-shaped basins below. The statues were a later addition from 1715 by Claude-Augustin Cayot. In 1882, President Chester A. Arthur appointed William Waldorf Astor Minister to Italy, a post he held until 1885. While living in Rome, Astor developed a lifelong passion for art and sculpture. In 1896, he purchased the balustrade and had it installed at his English estate Cliveden. It is a Grade II Listed Building. In 2004, a colony of small Mediterranean land snails of the species &quot;Papillifera bidens&quot; was discovered living on the Borghese Balustrade. Presumably, this species, new to the English fauna, was accidentally imported along with the balustrade in the late 19th century and managed to survive the intervening winters to the present day.

In the 18th century Marcantonio Borghese, 5th Prince of Sulmona transformed the villa&#x27;s gardens from a formal garden architecture into an English landscape garden. Architect Antonio Asprucci and his son Mario worked on landscaping the villa&#x27;s gardens, from 1782 for over twenty years. They placed statues around the park and started the construction of the Garden of the Lake and Piazza di Siena. They built the Temple of Aesculapius in the ionic style in the center of the lake between 1785 and 1792.

The Sea Horse Fountain was executed by Vincenzo Pacetti in 1791, based on a design by Christopher Unterberger. The Fountain of Venus was probably designed by Giovanni Vasanzio.

Marcantonio&#x27;s sons, Camillo and Francesco Borghese expanded the park further. 
The Villa Borghese gardens were long informally open, but was bought by the commune of Rome and given to the public in 1903. Since 1904 monuments depicting famous foreign personalities and writers such as Victor Hugo, have been placed along the avenues of the villa. The statue of Goethe was a gift to the city of Rome from Wilhelm II, German Emperor.

The large landscape park in the English taste contains several villas. The Spanish Steps lead up to this park, and there is another entrance at the Porte del Popolo by Piazza del Popolo. The &quot;Pincio&quot; (the Pincian Hill of ancient Rome), in the south part of the park, offers one of the greatest views over Rome.

Camillo Borghese threw grandiose shows and popular festivals, such as a ride in an air balloon from the Piazza di Siena. The first horse show was held at the Piazza di Siena in 1922. The Piazza di Siena hosted the equestrian dressage, individual jumping, and the jumping part of the eventing competition for the 1960 Summer Olympics.

==Villas in the gardens==

*Today the Galleria Borghese is housed in the Villa Borghese itself. The garden Casino Borghese, built on a rise above the Villa by the architect Giovanni Vasanzio, was set up by Camillo Borghese to contain sculptures by Bernini from the Borghese collection, including his &quot;David&quot; and his &quot;Daphne&quot;, and paintings by Titian, Raphael and Caravaggio
*The Villa Giulia adjoining the Villa Borghese gardens was built in 1551 – 1555 as a summer residence for Pope Julius III; now it contains the Etruscan Museum (&quot;Museo Etrusco&quot;).
*The Villa Medici houses the French Academy in Rome, and the &quot;Fortezzuola&quot; a Gothic garden structure that houses a collection memorializing the academic modern sculptor Pietro Canonica. In the 1650s, Diego Velázquez painted several depictions of this Villa&#x27;s garden casino festively illuminated at night. Before electricity, such torchlit illuminations carried an excitement hard to conceive today.
*Other villas scattered through the Villa Borghese gardens are remains of a world exposition in Rome in 1911.
**The located in its grounds has a collection of 19th- and 20th-century paintings emphasizing Italian artists. 
**Architecturally the most notable of the 1911 exposition pavilions is the English pavilion designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens (who later designed New Delhi), now housing the British School at Rome.

== Gardens ==
* Giardino del Lago

:The accesses to the garden are in via Madama Letizia and in viale Pietro Canonica. This is an English garden, transformed by Piano dei licini by Marcantonio IV Borghese at the end of the 18th century into a fashionable garden. Together with the Aspruccis as directors of the works, people like Jacob More alternated between gardeners and artists. Characteristic is the lake in which the Temple of Aesculapius is reflected.
:The first historical sources attesting to the works on the Piano dei Licini date back to 1784, works which ended in 1790 with Mario Asprucci as director. In addition to the aforementioned temple of Aesculapius, the temple of Antoninus and Faustina and the temple of Diana were inserted, all in neoclassical style, works immersed in an English garden style garden, although the presence of straight paths and the use of classical furnishings were quite far from the fashionable gardens of the time in France and England. Very little remains of these furnishings: in addition to the three temples, the sarcophagus of Phaethon, a column, some ollas and a statue. But contemporary citations suggest the area was dotted with statues. The most recent statuary group is the bronze one with satyrs playing with their little one, from 1929.

* Piazzale Scipione Borghese Garden or Rear Garden of Casino Nobile
:Originally there was the Narcissus fountain surrounded by ancient statues, furnishings and four herms perhaps by Pietro Bernini and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The garden, as we see it today, is a twentieth-century development with the replacement of the previous fountain with that of Venus surrounded by a classical garden.

* Giardini Segreti (Secret Gardens)
:They are located in Viale dell&#x27;Uccelliera, on the border between the first and second enclosures.
:Originally they were located on both sides of the Casino Nobile. The first was called melangoli, while the second was called flowers. They date back to the period of Cardinal Scipione. There are two others dating back to around 1680 located between the Uccelliera and Meridiana pavilions. They were used for plantations of rare and exotic flowers, mainly bulb. One of these gardens had rows of citrus trees near the long surrounding walls and flowers in the central avenues. In the ledgers of 1610 there are payment orders for bulbous plants. The fourth garden, or propagation garden, is used as a nursery for plants to be used for the other three secret gardens.
:These gardens are derived from the &#x27;&quot;hortus conclusus&quot; of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Baroque era. In these periods the secret gardens are always surrounded by walls.
:After the oldest gardens, marble fountains were placed with the function of pilo.
:In the 19th century the secret gardens were devastated by French bombings.
:At the beginning of the 20th century with the opening to the public, a new rearrangement rearranged the plants by removing all the plants considered inappropriate at the time and the rearrangement was simpler and more linear and divided into four flowerbeds located around the central fountains. Towards the beginning of the First World War, a new intervention was already planned for the first three secret gardens with the arrangement of two gazebos for guests, but already after the war these gazebos no longer existed, as did the Narcissus fountain, leaving the square bare and empty. New flowerbeds were then inserted which were destroyed during the Second World War, however, after various transformations over the centuries, little remains of the original layout of the secret gardens.
:You can get guided tours of the Giardini Segreti.

* Giardini di Valle Giulia
:They are located in Piazzale Ferdowsi. They were created for the Italian National Exhibition: Turin, Rome, Florence of 1911 to decorate the staircase created by Cesare Bazzani as a connection from Valle Giulia to Villa itself. The gardens balustrade consist of two nymphaeums neoclassical.

* Parco dei Daini
:It is located in via P. Raimondi. The garden was a reserve of the prince and was surrounded by some herms by Pietro and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Attached to the border wall there was the &quot;Perspective of the Theatre&quot;, from 1615, with relief decorations. The name derives from the fact that in the park, until the end of the Nineteenth century, there were fallow deer and gazelles.
:On the edge of the Parco dei Daini, on the corner between via Pinciana and via Pietro Raimondi, is located the &quot;Villa Umberto Barracks&quot;, headquarters of the mounted squad of the Polizia di Stato.

* Valle dei Platani
It is located in Largo P. Picasso. It has remained more or less unchanged since the 17th century and is also known by the name of &quot;Valle dei cani&quot; (&quot;Valley of the dogs&quot;), because it is used as a play area for dogs. It consists, among other things, of platani planted by Cardinal Scipione.

== Museums ==

Numerous museums are located inside or near the park:
* The Galleria Borghese
* The Museo Canonica
* The Museo Carlo Bilotti
* The Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna
* The National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia
* The Museo Civico di Zoologia

Furthermore, the park hosts the Casa del cinema, the Casina di Raffaello and the Gigi Proietti Globe Theatre.

==Other points of interest==

*The garden contains a replica of the Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre built in 2003. 
*Beside the 1911 Exposition&#x27;s villas, there is the Exposition&#x27;s Zoo, recently redesigned, with minimal caging, as the Bioparco, and the Zoological Museum (&quot;Museo di Zoologia&quot;). Nearby is the &quot;Casina di Raffaello&quot; playroom, which has crafts and reading rooms, and a space where children can dress up in royal outfits.
*In 1873 a hydrochronometer on the 1867 design of Gian Battista Embriaco, O.P. inventor and professor of the Roman College of St. Thomas was built in the gardens in emulation of the one at the College of St. Thomas. Another version stands in the gardens of the Pincian Hill. Embriaco had presented two prototypes of his invention at the Paris Universal Exposition in 1867 where it won prizes and great acclaim.

<text>Ferrero International SpA ( , ), more commonly known as Ferrero Group or simply Ferrero, is an Italian multinational company with headquarters in Alba. Ferrero is a manufacturer of branded chocolate and confectionery products, and the second biggest chocolate producer and confectionery company in the world. Ferrero SpA is a private company owned by the Ferrero family and has been described as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most secretive firms&quot;.

It was founded in 1946 in Alba, Piedmont, Italy, by Pietro Ferrero, a confectioner and small-time pastry maker who laid the groundwork for Nutella. The company saw a period of tremendous growth and success under Pietro&#x27;s son Michele Ferrero, who in turn handed over the daily operations to his sons, Pietro Jr. and Giovanni Ferrero (the founder&#x27;s grandsons).

Pietro Jr., who oversaw global business, died in 2011 of a heart attack while cycling in South Africa at the age of 47.

The Ferrero Group worldwide – now headed by executive chairman Giovanni Ferrero – includes 38 trading companies, 18 factories, and approximately 40,000 employees, and produces around 365,000 tonnes of Nutella each year.

== History ==

In 1946, Pietro Ferrero invented a cream of hazelnuts and cocoa, derived from gianduja and called it &quot;Pasta Gianduja&quot;. The initial product came in solid loaves wrapped in aluminium foil, which had to be sliced with a knife, and was succeeded by a spreadable version called Supercrema.

With assistance from his brother Giovanni Ferrero Sr., Pietro Ferrero created his new company to produce and market the initial product. Pietro was succeeded by his son Michele Ferrero as chief executive. Michele and his wife Maria Franca relaunched his father&#x27;s recipe as Nutella, which was first sold in 1964. After World War II, they opened production sites and offices abroad, and Nutella eventually became the world&#x27;s leading chocolate-nut spread brand. Ferrero is the world&#x27;s largest consumer of hazelnuts, buying up 25% of global production in 2014. The company is currently run by Giovanni Ferrero, grandson of Pietro and son of Michele Ferrero.

The company places great emphasis on secrecy, reportedly to guard against industrial espionage. It has never held a press conference and does not allow media visits to its plants. Ferrero&#x27;s products are made with machines designed by an in-house engineering department.

=== Acquisitions ===
* In 2014, Ferrero acquired Oltan Group, the largest hazelnut supplier in the world.
* In June 2015, Ferrero acquired the British chocolate retailer Thorntons for £112 million.
* In 2016, Ferrero SpA acquired Belgian biscuit brands Delacre and DeliChoc from United Biscuits.
* In March 2017, Ferrero SpA bought the US chocolate maker Fannie May from 1-800-Flowers.com. The deal closed on 30 May 2017, and Ferrero paid $115 million. Ferrero indicated that they hope to expand Fannie May, with locations across the US, not just in Chicago.
* In September 2017, Lapo Civiletti became the first non-family CEO in the history of the company. Giovanni Ferrero instead became the executive chairman, focusing on long-term strategy.
* In October 2017, Ferrero announced that they would acquire the Ferrara Candy Company. The acquisition was completed that December.
* In January 2018, it was reported that Ferrero was purchasing Nestlé&#x27;s American confectionery business for $2.8 billion. The deal included such brands as Baby Ruth, Crunch Bar and Butterfinger, but did not affect Nestlé&#x27;s confectionery business elsewhere, and did not include Kit Kat, Nesquik or the Toll House baking line. The acquisition was completed in March 2018. Consumer market strategist Lawrence Allen characterized the merger as Nestlé moving to being a health company, and as Ferrero acquiring a manufacturing base in the US and expand their US product range.
* In July 2019, Ferrero further expanded its US operations by purchasing a collection of business owned by Kellogg&#x27;s. Included in the deal were Kelloggs&#x27; cookie, fruit and fruit-flavoured snack, ice cream cone and pie crust businesses including famous brands such as Famous Amos, Murray&#x27;s, Keebler, Mother&#x27;s and Little Brownie Bakers (one of the producers of the cookies for the Girl Scouts of the USA), as well as a leased manufacturing facility in Baltimore, six food manufacturing facilities across the country, and two plants in Chicago. Ferrero paid Kellogg&#x27;s $1.3 billion.
* In early 2020, a subsidiary of Ferrero purchased Campbell Soup Company&#x27;s stake in the Danish bakery Kelsen Group for $300 million.
* In October 2020, it was announced that Ferrero would buy UK company Fox&#x27;s Biscuits for £250 million. In December 2020, Ferrero announced it was acquiring healthy snack company Eat Natural.
* In June 2021, Ferrero bought British firm Burton&#x27;s Biscuit Company, which at the time of purchase employed 2,000 people at six plants in the UK. It is believed the transaction was made for about £360 million.
* In April 2022, it was announced Ferrero had acquired the Dublin-based vitamin and protein bar producer Fulfil Nutrition.
* In December 2022, the company announced its acquisition of Wells Enterprises, an American ice cream manufacturer based in LeMars, Iowa. Wells Enterprises is best known for Blue Bunny, Blue Ribbon, Bomb Pop, and Halo Top brands.
* In February 2023, it was announced Ferrero would acquire the Naples-based frozen bakery company Fresystem SPA.

===2022 salmonella outbreak===
On 6 April 2022, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) began investigating a &quot;rapidly evolving&quot; outbreak of salmonella linked to Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs.

The outbreak affected European countries, with products being recalled &quot;as a precautionary step&quot;. Products were also recalled in Canada and the US.

On 8 April, Belgian authorities ordered the closure of a Kinder chocolate factory in Arlon suspected to be behind the outbreak. On 12 April, the EFSA and the ECDC published a rapid outbreak assessment on a multi-country outbreak of monophasic &quot;salmonella typhimurium&quot; linked to chocolate products made at the Belgian factory. The report found that in December 2021, salmonella was detected in a buttermilk tank at the Belgian establishment during the manufacturer&#x27;s own checks, and the chocolate products were distributed across Europe and globally.

As of 8 April 2022, 150 cases had been reported in ten European countries, including Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

==Products==

Ferrero produces several lines of confectionery goods under various brand names, as well as the chocolate-hazelnut spread Nutella (since 1964). Ferrero uses one-quarter of the world&#x27;s annual hazelnut supply.

It also produces the line of Ferrero branded chocolate products, including Pocket Coffee, Mon Chéri, Confetteria Raffaello, Ferrero Küsschen and the Ferrero Prestige line, which comprises three different brands of pralines: Ferrero Rocher, Ferrero Rondnoir, and Garden Coco.

Ferrero&#x27;s Kinder brand line of chocolate products includes Kinder Surprise, Kinder Joy, Kinder Chocolate, Kinder Happy Hippo, Kinder Maxi, Kinder Duplo, Kinder Country, Kinder Délice, and Kinder Bueno.

The company also produces Tic Tac mints, available in a variety of flavours, along with sugar free versions. Other Ferrero products include Giotto, Fiesta Ferrero, Hanuta chocolate hazelnut-filled wafers, and Gran Soleil frozen desserts, which won the company an innovation award in March 2011. Ferrero has been producing Thorntons products since acquiring the company in 2015.

==Philanthropy==
In 1983, the company established the Ferrero Foundation in Alba, Piedmont at the wish of Michele Ferrero. The foundation promotes activities in the areas of art, science, history and literature by organizing conventions, conferences, seminars and exhibitions. It also offers health and social assistance to ex-employees who have been with the group for at least 25 years.

<text>Operation Rentier (&#x27;Reindeer&#x27;) was a German operation during World War II intended to secure the nickel mines around Petsamo in Finland, against a Soviet attack in the event of a renewed war between Finland and the Soviet Union.

The planning for the operation started on 13 August 1940, after the German occupation of Norway was complete and was finalized in October that year. The plan called for the two divisions of the to occupy Petsamo and prevent Soviet capture of the mines.

The operation was carried out by the Wehrmacht as part of Operation Barbarossa, the German attack on the Soviet Union and began on 22 June 1941. The 2nd Mountain Division occupied the area around Liinakhamari and the 3rd Mountain Division occupied Luostari. The operation was followed up by Operation Platinum Fox, which was an attack by the two divisions against Murmansk as a part of the larger Operation Silver Fox.

<doc id="846877" wikidata="Q4958501" url="?curid=846877" title="Braxton Hicks (album)">
<text>Braxton Hicks is the fourth studio album by Australian alternative rock band Jebediah. It was recorded between January and February 2004 and released on 12 July 2004 by record label Redline, a defunct independent record label that was co-owned by the band, making it the band&#x27;s first independent release.

== Recording ==

The album was recorded in January and February 2004 and was co-produced by the band together with engineer Matt Lovell (Silverchair, Something for Kate, The Mess Hall), in a converted Masonic Lodge (Kingdom Studios) located in the inner Perth suburb of Maylands. The album was mixed by Shaun O&#x27;Callaghan (John Butler, Eskimo Joe, Gyroscope) at Studio Couch in North Fremantle.

== Content ==

Braxton Hicks, as the band have explained, are the false labour contractions some women experience before childbirth, named after the 19th-century English doctor who &quot;discovered&quot; them. Mitchell was struck by the term when he read it in a medical book. He explains, &quot;We saw it as an analogy for songwriting in that the songwriting process is like the contractions, and the end product, the song, is like the child. And you can take it as far as you want really.&quot;

== Promotion ==

The first single, &quot;First Time&quot;, released on 24 May 2004, reached No. 50 on Australian ARIA Singles Charts. The second single, &quot;No Sleep&quot;, was released 1 August 2004 and did not chart on the mainstream charts but entered Triple J&#x27;s Net 50 at No. 8. It is featured on the 2006 WAMi dual disc compilation &quot;Kiss My WAMi 2006&quot;, with the audio on the CD album and its video on the DVD. Bass guitarist Vanessa Thornton was nominated for a WAMi Award for &#x27;Best Bassist&#x27;.

== Release ==

&quot;Braxton Hicks&quot; was released on 12 July 2004 by record label Redline. It was the first album released by Jebediah following the band&#x27;s status as an independent band; the band&#x27;s longtime label Murmur (a subsidiary of Sony Music Australia) ceased contractual arrangements in 2002. Bassist Vanessa Thornton has since stated that she was unhappy with Sony&#x27;s promotion of the band&#x27;s previous, self-titled album, a history that also involved the band&#x27;s manager at the time.

It entered the Australian charts at No. 26, a poor result given that the band&#x27;s first two albums had debuted in the top ten. However, the band estimated that it could break even with fewer sales as an independent act than on a major label.

Initial copies of the album were released with a bonus DVD, &quot;The Winnie Cobb Sessions&quot; (the name &quot;Winnie Cobb&quot; is, according to the band&#x27;s manager at the time, associated with the band&#x27;s tour of the United States and refers to a guru-type figure). The DVD features the band at Perth&#x27;s Blackbird Studios (the band would record its next album at the same recording studio) performing songs from the &quot;Braxton Hicks&quot; writing and recording period.

<text>Century Falls is a British cross-genre series broadcast in six twenty-five-minute episodes on BBC1 in early 1993. Written by Russell T Davies, it tells the story of teenager Tess Hunter and her mother, who move to the seemingly idyllic rural village of Century Falls, only to find that it hides many powerful secrets.

==Background==
Russell T Davies had worked in the BBC Children&#x27;s Department for many years, writing the science-fiction series &quot;Dark Season&quot; for the weekday afternoon Children&#x27;s BBC strand in 1991. The following year, he had left the BBC to work for Granada Television, where he was producing and writing for their children&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot;.

The director of &quot;Dark Season&quot;, Colin Cant, had been assigned to direct another children&#x27;s series for BBC1, but had little enthusiasm for the script. Instead, he wrote to Davies asking if he could provide something else. Davies quickly wrote the first episode of &quot;Century Falls&quot; for Cant to take to his superiors, who then fully commissioned the programme.

The production was shot entirely on location around Richmond, Langthwaite, Muker and locations around the northern Yorkshire Dales. The waterfall of Century Falls was actually Gibson&#x27;s Cave, just north of Bowlees.

The series was broadcast as part of Children&#x27;s BBC on BBC1 on Wednesday afternoons at 5:10 pm from 17 February to 24 March 1993. Each episode was repeated on BBC2 the Sunday morning after transmission.

&quot;Century Falls&quot; was released on DVD by 2|entertain Ltd on 24 July 2006. Upon release, it received a British Board of Film Classification rating of PG.

==Plot==
When Tess Hunter and her mother arrive in Century Falls, they gradually find it to be a strange village, haunted by a disaster that befell it during the performance of an occult ceremony forty years earlier.

Tess befriends the only other children in the village, brother and sister Ben and Carey Naismith, and finds that Ben has strange powers which he draws from the waterfall that gives the village its name.

The Naismiths&#x27; uncle Richard is working with his aged father, Dr Josiah Naismith, to complete the unfinished ceremony using Ben&#x27;s powers, hoping to raise the spirit of a mysterious God-like being, Century. They are eventually stopped by Tess&#x27;s actions, aided by the local Harkness sisters, who knew the original tragedy of the 1950s events.

==Cast and crew==
Russell T Davies had already gained a good reputation from his work on &quot;Dark Season&quot; and &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot;. He later went on to forge a career as one of Britain&#x27;s top writers of television drama, although he did not write again for the BBC until he penned an episode of &quot;Linda Green&quot;, transmitted on BBC One in 2001. Davies became the chief writer of the revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005, for which he won several awards, including a BAFTA for Best Drama.

Colin Cant had, for many years, been the Producer of the BBC&#x27;s long-running school drama &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, and had directed several well-received children&#x27;s series before &quot;Century Falls&quot;, such as &quot;Moondial&quot; (1990) and &quot;Dark Season&quot;.

Of the cast, the three teenage leads were unknown: Catherine Sanderson as Tess, Simon Fenton as Ben, and Emma Jane Lavin as Carey. Simon Fenton has since gone on to appear in several well-known television dramas, such as ITV&#x27;s police soap opera &quot;The Bill&quot; (in 2002) and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001).

Many of the adult cast were already well-known character actors from a range of British television dramas. Bernard Kay (Richard Naismith) had appeared in episodes of many long-running British television dramas, such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; and &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, as well as films such as &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot; (1958) and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965). Mary Wimbush (Esme Harkness) appeared in the BBC&#x27;s famous adaptation of &quot;Poldark&quot; (1975) and several episodes of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; (1990–1992). She was probably best known, however, as the voice of Julia Pargetter in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s long-running rural soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Gemmano took place during World War II, between September 4, and September 15 of 1944. The battle occurred in the area of the Gothic Line, near the Apennine Mountains in northern Italy, which would soon turn out to be the last line of defense for the Axis Powers in Italy. The village of Gemmano was eventually captured on September 9, 1944, by the invading Eighth Army (United Kingdom), but two more subsequent attacks were needed to secure the area surrounding the village of Gemmano. Fighting was so fierce, similar to that of the famous battle of Monte Cassino, that the battle was sometimes referred to as, “ The Cassino of the Adriatic”.

Under Operation Olive, the objective for the British Eighth Army on the Adriatic Coast was to break the German defenses and enter the Po Plains. The US Fifth Army would then follow up with an attack north of Florence, completing the German defeat.
The first assault, as well as the following ten, would prove to be futile for the Allies. The final assault brought on by the 4th Indian Infantry Division, after heavy bombardment, would prove to be successful in the capture and securement of all German positions in Gemmano.

===Initial reconnaissance of Gemmano===
Two days before the first attack on September 4, a British Battalion sent a platoon of 30 men to determine the size and strength of the German defenses. The British made an unfortunate mistake, underestimating the size of the German forces as only one battalion.
The actual size of the German force was approximately three battalions or 4,500 men of the 100th Gebirgsjager that were overlooking the allied positions. The Allies left only one battalion to fight the battle at Gemmano because of their wrong estimation of the German forces.
These German battalions consisted of antiaircraft weaponry as well, which could also be used as artillery on the advancing allied infantry and armored vehicles.
===General conditions===
As the numerous attacks on the village of Gemmano took place, heavy rainfall hindered the advance of Allies as well. This heavy rainfall caused roads to crumble, rivers to overflow, and mud to form, all of which made it difficult for movement and transportation. Slopes of mountains became slick and slippery and allowed for weapon malfunctions to occur.

Below are personal memoirs, testimony, and description of the battle by soldiers who were involved.

&quot;All around the bullet-chipped cross on Pt.449, the dead, khaki and field-grey, lay heaped, unburied, in score upon score; at their center a soldier of the Lincolns whose hands were still frozen in death round the cross itself, which he had reached in his battalion&#x27;s first attack. Few regiments of 8th Army had ever known fiercer fighting than that of Gemmano&quot;

&quot;Within twenty-four hours the only men left in the village of Gemmano... were the men who would never leave&quot;.

&quot;They sat, wedged side by side, in the ruined cellars of the old stone houses; sprawled in piles on the doorways of barns; lay in untidy heaps in the little peasants&#x27; houses where they had crawled to die&quot;.

Holworthy (CO 4th Indian Div.) wrote in his diary :
&quot;A good show. Gemmano full of dead and smells like another Cassino&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
Casualties from both sides are not well documented, but according to British sources, Germans killed in action were more than 900. Lt.Col.Ernst also estimated more than 2,400 casualties of dead, wounded, and MIA of his regiment alone. British casualties were immense too: every battalion lost, on average, 100 to 150 men. More than 100 civilians were also killed during the battle, mainly due to the Royal Navy and its bombardment of Gemmano.
===Medals and awards===
The German 100th Mountain Regiment, or Gebirgsjager, under the orders from Lt. Col. Richard Ernst, earned the regiment 6 Ritterkreuz des Eisernes Kreuz for valor demonstrated during the battle of Gemmano as well as acts of bravery in combat far beyond the normal fulfillment of duty.

Ritterkruez awards were given to:

Lt. Col. Richard Ernst

Capt. Heinrich Hermann

Capt. Fritz Bachmaier

Ensign August Rappel

Corp. Lorenz Schmied

Lt. Karl Kurz

<text>A police community support officer (PCSO; ), or as written in legislation Community Support Officer (CSO; ), is a uniformed member of police staff in England and Wales, a role created by Section 38(2) of the Police Reform Act 2002, which was given Royal Assent by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 July 2002. They are not warranted, but hold a variety of police powers and the power of a constable in various instances by the forty-three territorial police forces in England and Wales and the British Transport Police (which is the only specialist police service to employ PCSOs).

==History==
PCSOs were introduced in September 2002 and first recruited by the Metropolitan Police. The first ever PCSO on the streets was PCSO 7115 Barry Faust, who was stationed at Belgravia Police Station in Westminster, Central London. PCSO 7155 was due to begin his shift at 7 am on 9 September 2002; however, owing to a vehicle needing to go to a garage for repair, Barry and a sergeant left Belgravia early between 6:30 and 6:45. En route, the duo were required to assist a lorry under a bridge, and, thus, Barry became the first PCSO with duties on the streets of the UK.

Proposals for PCSOs in Northern Ireland were prevented by a budget shortfall in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as well as fears that the introduction of uniformed and unarmed PCSOs in Northern Ireland (PSNI constables all carry firearms) would mean they would potentially then become a &quot;legitimate target&quot; in the eyes of the IRA who have attacked other civilians working for the police in Northern Ireland in the past. The Police Reform Act 2002 does not apply to Scotland, which consequently does not have Police Community Support Officers (the acronym PCSO in Police Scotland refers to a Police Custody and Security Officer, known as a detention officer in other parts of the UK.)

, there were 8,263 PCSOs in England and Wales.
PCSO numbers had, like those of police constables, been falling in previous years owing to austerity. At their prior peak in 2009, 16,814 PCSOs were employed. PCSOs represent 6.8% of total police employees in England and Wales. The Metropolitan Police has the highest contingent of PCSOs, accounting for a quarter of PCSOs in England and Wales. The service with the second largest contingent as of 2012 was Greater Manchester Police (GMP) with 837 PCSOs, which was 5% of the total.

, pay for PCSOs, which vary from force to force, range between £19,000 to around £26,000 per year depending on experience.

==Role==

Most PCSOs work within a Safer Neighbourhood team (SNT) or Neighbourhood Policing team (NPT) that contains special constables and beat managers (police sergeants). These teams are led by a neighbourhood inspector. Day-to-day duties usually include high visibility patrolling, tackling anti-social behaviour, dealing with minor offences, crowd control and directing traffic at public events, helping direct traffic at roadblocks or scenes of accidents, gathering criminal intelligence, and supporting front-line policing. The Home Office have specifically limited the powers designated to PCSOs to maintain the distinction between them and police officers. Some PCSOs are attached to Road Policing Units, and British Transport Police PCSOs are deployed as part of station teams. As with many aspects of PCSOs, the specifics of each job description vary depending on the relevant force.

==Recruitment selection and training==

===Recruitment and selection===
Police forces will recruit PCSOs through adverts placed in newspapers and on the Internet and by posters in public places. Some may use open days as a method of attracting applicants which is the same way constables are recruited. The recruitment of PCSOs has helped some police forces increase the representation of ethnic minorities among their employees. Unlike with police constables, there is no set selection procedure for PCSOs and the process varies between forces although section 38 of the Police Reform Act 2002 (the law that made PCSOs) requires that chief constables or Commissioners in charge of police forces have a duty to ensure a recruit &quot;is a suitable person to carry out the functions for the purposes of which they are designated&quot; and is &quot;capable of effectively carrying out those functions&quot;. Generally, PCSOs will be selected through a process that involves: an application form, interview and fitness tests; a medical test; and security and background vetting. Welsh PCSOs must have basic abilities to speak the Welsh language.

===Training===
Unlike police constables, there is no set training procedure for PCSOs so the training given varies from force to force although section 38 of the Police Reform Act 2002 (the law that made PCSOs) requires that chief constables or commissioners to ensure a recruit &quot;Has received adequate training in the carrying out of those functions and in the exercise and performance of the powers and duties to be conferred on him by virtue of their designation&quot;. The original PCSOs recruited in 2002 by the Metropolitan Police received only 3 weeks&#x27; training, which was criticised as too little. The training period was eventually raised, and new Metropolitan Police PCSOs are now trained for six weeks. Training in other forces takes between four and eleven weeks, with the length of training depending on how close the PCSOs&#x27; authority comes to that of a regular police officer.

PCSOs are trained in a variety of tasks, including: radio procedure; report writing; dealing with evidence; going to court; gathering intelligence; managing a crime scene; usage of PCSO powers under the Police Reform Act 2002 and any person powers; use of force; human rights; race and diversity; traffic direction and cordon manning; general health and safety; self-defence (including restraint techniques and the use of handcuffs or leg restraints if used by their force); and first aid. Written examinations are usually performed during training. Upon successful completion of training, there may be a passing out parade.

After training a new PCSO is normally sent out on patrol with a tutor—usually an experienced PCSO—until they are able to patrol on their own. All PCSOs go through a twelve-month probationary period after completing training.

==Uniform and equipment==
The uniform of a PCSO is similar to that of a police constable, but has a variety of uniquely distinguishing features depending on the wearer&#x27;s respective force. As with a lot of things about PCSOs, their uniforms have a great deal of variation between police forces. The current ACPO guidance states that &quot;PCSOs should be recognisable to the public as police staff, but visibly distinct from sworn police officers&quot;. Since PCSOs were first created in 2002, many forces have made changes to the uniforms issued. Most of these changes are commonly in regards to shirts, trousers and headgear.

===Headgear===


A PCSO&#x27;s headgear is normally a black formal peaked cap for men and a black bowler for women, although some forces are now opting for female PCSOs to wear the peaked cap. Headgear may or may not display the force crest, some have a metal shield, usually blue, stating &quot;police community support officer&quot; followed below with the name of the wearer&#x27;s respective force in smaller letters. Some newer versions of such shields have the wearer&#x27;s respective force crest printed on them. Most forces now simply issue the same hat badge that is issued to constables.
 The band on the hat is usually a silver reflective band with blue edging, a plain blue band, a chequered blue and silver band or a black and white Sillitoe tartan chequered band.

Male PCSOs wear flat, peaked caps rather than custodian helmets, which are worn by male police constables and sergeants. The Metropolitan Police Authority noted in 2004 that the hats worn by male PCSOs were not rigid and &#x27;may therefore not offer adequate protection&#x27;. Female PCSOs wear bowler hats which contain foam padding as protection.

Some police forces have unique hat designs for PCSOs which are different from the more common styles, such as those worn by the City of London Police PCSOs who adhere to the force&#x27;s tradition of red detailing, red banding, and a red shield. Another is Merseyside Police, whose PCSOs wear a blue band with green edging. The badge was formerly a black cloth patch bearing the words ‘Merseyside Police Community Support &amp; Traffic Officer’. Merseyside PCSOs are now issued a metal force badge instead. North Wales Police () PCSOs wear black baseball caps with a blue band with &quot;police support&quot; written in both English and Welsh.

Surrey Police and Greater Manchester Police (GMP) give their Traffic PCSOs (who are part of GMP&#x27;s Road Policing Unit (RPU)) white covered caps in the same style as traffic police officers. The hat retains though the standard blue band and force crest as other PCSOs in GMP.

===Formal uniform===
Generally, most forces do not have a formal uniform for their PCSOs, but a few provide tunics. Tunics are the same as that of a Police Constable but may have special badging to distinguish the wearer as a PCSO. As with police constables, PCSOs very rarely wear tunics (provided they have been given them). One of the few examples was during the funeral of PCSO Mark Marshall of Devon and Cornwall Police who was killed in Afghanistan whilst serving in the Territorial Army. His funeral was attended by police colleagues wearing tunics including PCSOs.

In 2012, PCSOs who had been in service since Monday 6 February 2012 and had completed five full calendar years in the role were awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. This is a commemorative medal created in 2011 to mark the 60th anniversary of the accession to the throne of Elizabeth II. PCSOs awarded the honour may wear the ribbon of the medal while on daily routine patrol. This medal was also given to police constables under similar rules. Gwent Police issued a silver coloured &quot;Gwent Police Staff Diamond Jubilee Badge 2012&quot;, a small lapel badge awarded to all police constables and PCSOs who received the Jubilee Medal.

===Operational uniform===
Shirts for PCSOs are either white, blue or black. Originally the shirts were collared, ironed, smart and formal with two front pockets and radio loops but in recent years are being replaced in most forces with breathable shirts made to be worn with stab vests. Such new shirts unlike their predecessors are sometimes marked with &quot;PCSO&quot; or &quot;police community support officer&quot; on the sleeves or chest. North Wales Police now have the Welsh flag on both sleeves of their shirts, for both constables and PCSOs.

Neckwear if worn is a tie for men or a cravat for women. Neckwear is normally light blue, but is sometimes black. Some police forces issue name and/or number badges to its officers to be worn on their uniforms. PCSOs in such forces have &quot;PCSO&quot; or &quot;police community support officer&quot; written before their name or number. The badge is sometimes also differently coloured from the badge of regular police officers. Trousers are usually black or dark navy blue. Originally, these were ironed, smart and formal, but in recent years are being replaced in most forces with cargo pocketed designs to allow the PCSO to carry more items.

Body armour vests are issued to PCSOs—although originally not all forces did this—and wearing one is usually compulsory. Staffordshire Police was the last police force to issue Stab vests to PCSOs; they were only issued to officers of this force in April 2011. Some forces issue tactical vests to PCSOs that go over the body armour to provide alternative storage to a duty belt. The vest usually comes in black or hi-vis yellow.

Most PCSOs tend to wear blue epaulettes on their shoulders, although some forces use black epaulettes. Since 2009 a few forces began embroidering names on to epaulettes. PCSOs are issued with hi-visibility jackets and waterproof coats of varying design depending on the force. Officers may also be issued with a simple tabard for traffic duties. PCSOs wear nylon duty belts with quick release buckles to hold their equipment in pouches.

===Cycle patrol uniform===
Special uniforms exist in most forces for cycling for both PCSOs and constables. This typically consists of a cycling helmet, breathable cycling shirt and cargo cycling trousers. Hi-visibility jackets or vests are normally compulsory for cycling.

===Equipment===
PCSOs use a police radio to communicate with other PCSOs, police officers and the control room on the same channel. Some neighbourhood police teams (NPT) or safer neighbourhood teams (SNT) also monitor local shop/pub watch radios. A body armour vest is issued to all PCSOs although in previous years some forces did not do this. Arrangements for use vary between forces, from compulsory use throughout shift, to officers&#x27; choice of use. Unlike constables, owing to the non-confrontational nature of their role, PCSOs are not normally issued with batons, incapacitant spray, handcuffs or leg restraints. However, PCSOs are authorised to carry and use this equipment. Four forces are an exception to this convention: British Transport Police PCSOs are issued with handcuffs and leg restraints; Also Dyfed-Powys Police, North Wales Police and Merseyside PCSOs are issued with handcuffs.

Forces such as South Wales Police also issue &#x27;Biteback&#x27; dog spray.

Most police forces allow some PCSOs to use laser and radar guns to help enforce speed limits.

==Powers==
PCSO powers vary between forces. The powers of PCSOs mainly stem from the Police Reform Act 2002, and every PCSO since 2007 has a number of standard powers that were introduced for all PCSOs regardless of which force they belong to. This is in addition to the discretionary powers that can be designated by the chief constable or commissioner of each PCSO&#x27;s respective force. Before 2003, the British Transport Police was unable to have PCSOs until Section 28 of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 allowed the BTP Chief Constable to recruit PCSOs and designate powers to them using the Police Reform Act 2002—which previously only extended to chief constables or commissioners of territorial police forces.

PCSOs must adhere to certain standards. Failure to do so could result in disciplinary or criminal proceedings related to misfeasance in public office or malfeasance in public office. Leeway may be given depending on the situation, as the circumstances may dictate they do not have the training or equipment to deal with a situation like a constable could. It is also accepted that PCSOs do not have to intervene in high risk situations and it is reasonable if they decide to withdraw from one. This is due to the non-confrontational purpose of their role.

PCSOs are not attested constables, and therefore do not have the same powers of arrest under section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. They can, however, utilise the &#x27;any person&#x27; powers of arrest under section 24A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (commonly known as a citizens&#x27; arrest). This means they are able to arrest anyone without warrant providing there are reasonable grounds to suspect they are committing, or have committed or are suspected to be guilty of an indictable or &#x27;either-way&#x27; offence, provided the necessity criteria set out in statute are met. This covers offences such as arson, criminal damage, theft, assault, possession of a controlled drug and burglary, etc. All PCSOs can also make common law arrests in the same manner as civilians, to prevent a breach of the peace. They also have a power of entry.

Legislation exists that states that PCSOs are entitled to use reasonable force in order to effect an arrest as described above (under section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967), or to forcibly detain (using Police Reform Act 2002 powers) There is also a &#x27;reasonable code of conduct&#x27; which is a legitimate and tested defence to a (technical) common assault of which the courts have accepted and has now been written into case law ( e.g. leading two disputing parties away from each other to prevent a fight – technically an assault as neither party has been arrested/detained at this point, but still considered otherwise lawful).

The term to detain (under the meaning of the Police Reform Act 2002) is a relatively new one, but under law, it is considered a temporary arrest (in accordance with Schedule 4, Part 1, Paragraph 2A(2)(b) of the Police Reform Act 2002). As a result, a PCSO may any person arrest someone he or she has reasonable grounds to suspect is attempting to escape from lawful custody when subject to a detention requirement (under Schedule 4, Part 1, Paragraph 2(3) of the Police Reform Act 2002). Section 38 Offences Against the Person Act 1861 also creates the offence of assault with intent to resist arrest, which also covers the &quot;lawful apprehension/detention of himself or another&quot;. This is an either-way offence, meaning that the PCSO may also any person arrest for this offence in addition to the original proposed detention.

In September 2018, Section 1 of the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 created an either-way offence of any assault on any emergency worker, which includes PCSOs.

PCSOs may, subject to permission from their force, carry handcuffs and leg restraints which are both governed by the Criminal Law Act 1967 or common law and can be used in the same manner as a constable. They may use them for detaining or arresting a person using reasonable force under the powers listed. There are four forces at present whose PCSOs are currently carrying handcuffs (BTP, Dyfed-Powys Police, North Wales Police, Merseyside Police). PCSOs are also lawfully authorised to carry CS spray and a baton when on duty, although none have yet been provided by any Chief Officer of any Police Force.
PCSOs have a number of other powers and abilities that they may exercise in the course of their duty:

*General power of a constable to seize property
*Issue fixed penalty notices (FPN) for littering, breach of dog control orders and cycling on a footpath
*Require name and address where they have reason to believe a person has committed a road traffic offence, a &#x27;relevant offence&#x27;, a licensing offence, an act of anti-social behaviour or is in possession of a controlled drug
*Confiscate alcohol from persons in designated places and from under 18s, or anyone considered involved in supplying under 18s with alcohol
*Seize and dispose of tobacco from under 18s
*Seize (controlled) drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971
*Enter and search premises to save life or prevent serious damage to property
*Seize vehicles used to cause alarm, distress or annoyance (s.59 Police Reform Act 2002)
*Remove abandoned vehicles
*Stop bicycles
*Control traffic
*Carry out road checks
*Place traffic signs
*Enforce cordoned areas under the Terrorism Act 2000
*Photograph people away from a police station
*Stop and search in an authorised area under the Terrorism Act 2000 if authorised and supervised by a police officer

Certain additional powers which may be assigned to PCSOs by the chief constable (or commissioner in London), but which vary from force to force, include:
*Detain a person suspected to have committed an offence or an act of anti-social behaviour.
*Detain a person who does not provide their name and address when required
*Detain a person who fails to provide details or complies with orders of a PCSO.
*Use reasonable force in relation to a detained person or to prevent a detained person making off. This may involve the use of handcuffs and leg restraints if the PCSO has been issued with and authorised to use them.
*Issue penalty notices for disorder (PND), truancy, excluded pupils found in public places, dog fouling, graffiti and flyposting
*Power of a constable to issue an FPN under section 68 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 (fixed penalty notice in respect of failure to comply with public spaces protection order)
*Power to direct someone to leave a dispersal zone and/or seize property in relation to suspected ASB
*All the powers of a Traffic Warden
*Enforce bylaws
*Deal with begging. This involves requiring the person to stop begging as well as providing their name and address to the PCSO
*Enforce certain licensing offences
*Search detained people for dangerous items i.e. weapons and/or items that could effect an escape from the PCSO
*Disperse groups and remove under 16s to their place of residence
*Remove children contravening bans imposed by a curfew notice to their place of residence
*Remove truants to designated premises
*Search for alcohol and tobacco
*Enforce park trading offences
*Enter licensed premises (limited)
*Stop vehicles for testing
*Direct traffic for the purposes of escorting abnormal loads
*Deal with parking offences including giving fines

Individual chief constables or commissioners can increase the discretionary powers their PCSOs use from the existing list.

PCSO powers were further increased by the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 statute. This provided them with powers such as the power of a constable under Section 19 of PACE to seize any suspected criminal property or property suspected of being used in crime and further traffic FPN powers.

==Expansion of powers==
The Policing and Crime Act 2017 set out dramatic expansions to the role of PCSO. Section 28(4)(a) states a PCSO will be able to be designated with &quot;any power or duty of a constable (other than a power or duty specified in Part 1 of Schedule 3B excluded powers and duties)&quot;. These excluded powers would be:

* Any power or duty of a constable to make an arrest under s24 PACE 1984 (note: this does not limit the use of s24A PACE powers)
* Any power or duty of a constable to stop and search an individual or a vehicle or other thing
* The power of a constable, under section 36(4) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to perform the functions of a custody officer at a designated police station if a custody officer is not readily available to perform them
* Any power that is exercisable only by a constable of a particular rank
* Any power of a constable under (a) the Terrorism Act 2000; (b)the Terrorism Act 2006; (c)the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008; (d)the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011; (e)the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015
* Any power of a constable under the Official Secrets Act 1911 to 1989
* The power of a constable to make an application on behalf of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis under section 6 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (applications for interception warrants)

This bill received Royal Assent on 31 January 2017 and was subsequently passed into law.

==Use of force==
Under a mix of legislation and common law, a PCSO can use reasonable force to arrest or detain a suspected offender. PCSOs can all use handcuffs (if their force provides them) to detain using their own detention powers or arrest using &#x27;any person&#x27; powers when on duty. At present only four forces issue handcuffs officially.

The use of reasonable force is provided by s3 Criminal Law Act 1967, the Common Law and the Human Rights Act 1998. Reasonable force is further provided to PCSOs under Section 38(8) Police Reform Act 2002 when using a power which - in the same circumstances - would also be a power available to a Constable.

==Relevant offences==
&quot; The following are criminal offences in relation to PCSOs under the Police Reform Act 2002 for which a PCSO can detain, or a police constable can arrest for:&quot;

* Assaulting a PCSO during the course of his/her duty
* Assaulting an individual assisting a PCSO during the course of his/her duty
* Wilfully obstructing or resisting a PCSO during the course of his/her duty
* Failing to provide personal details upon request to a PCSO
* &#x27;Makes Off&#x27; Failing to provide correct personal details upon request to a PCSO
* &#x27;Makes Off&#x27; Having provided false personal details upon request to a PCSO
* Acting in an anti-social manner - failure to give name/address to PCSO
* Acting in an anti-social manner - &#x27;makes off&#x27; whilst detained
* Acting in an anti-social manner - &#x27;makes off&#x27; whilst detained &amp; fails to provide name/address to a PCSO
* Acting in an anti-social manner - &#x27;makes off&#x27; whilst accompanying PCSO to a police station
* Contravening a PCSO&#x27;s requirement to hand over alcohol
* Contravening a PCSO&#x27;s requirement to surrender tobacco
* Failure to stop a vehicle as directed by a PCSO
* Impersonating a PCSO
* The common assault (indictable) of an emergency worker (PCSO) under Section 1 Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018.

It is also an offence for a PCSO to imply that they have a power that they are not designated by their chief constable or commissioner.

This list is not exhaustive.

This list comes from definitions provided under paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 5 of the Police Reform Act 2002.

==Organisation==

===Rank structure===
PCSOs do not normally have a rank system; however, South Yorkshire and Kent Police employ PCSO supervisors. The South Yorkshire epaulettes have a &#x27;bar&#x27; above the wording &quot;Police Community Support Officer Supervisor - Traffic&quot; with the shoulder number beneath. PCSO supervisors only supervise PCSOs and normally work under a police sergeant.

Avon and Somerset Police currently utilise a PCSO Support role, which is an administration position allowing PCSOs to continue to meet the criteria; primarily subsection three of The Policing Pledge of 2009; to conduct high visibility patrols and spend at least eighty per cent of their tour of duty on patrol within the community. PCSOs are a civilianised non-uniform role, who deal mainly with the administration side of the Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT).

Although not a rank in itself, most forces have an official system of putting newly trained PCSOs on their probation with a PCSO tutor. A PCSO tutor is normally an experienced PCSO, sometimes with additional training, who will patrol with the new PCSO until he or she is ready to patrol alone. Whilst being tutored like a probationary police constable the new PCSO may have a number of tasks to complete whilst on patrol and will complete such tasks whilst being mentored by the PCSO tutor.

===Roles in the Metropolitan Police===
PCSO duties can vary from force to force. Many forces may officially have different roles for PCSOs in which special training and sometimes equipment is given. Within the Metropolitan Police, which is responsible for law enforcement in Greater London, several different types of PCSO exist

* Safer Neighbourhoods PCSO — Provides a uniformed presence in Safer Neighbourhood Teams, which police London&#x27;s boroughs and other areas within the MPS district.
* Safer Transport PCSO — Provides a uniformed presence on buses (policing on the railways and London Underground being provided by the British Transport Police.)
* Traffic PCSO — Provides a uniformed presence by assisting the Traffic OCU in roads policing, along with issuing penalty notices.
* Counter Terrorism PCSO (known prior to 2010 as a Security PCSO) provide a uniformed presence in well known areas in London, safeguarding against terrorism.
* Royal Parks PCSO — Provides a uniformed presence within the Royal Parks in the MPS District.
* Aviation Security PCSO — Provides a uniformed presence, assisting the Aviation Security OCU in policing of London airports.
* Station PCSO — Acts as front counter liaison with members of the public.
* Victim PCSO — Responsible for updating victims of crime about police investigations.
* Safer Schools PCSO — Provides a visible familiar police presence in local schools, tackling local school and student issues. This role was disbanded in 2012 leaving only Safer Schools police officers (SSOs)in the role.

==Vehicles==

Most forces allow their PCSOs, commonly those assigned to duties managing traffic, to drive marked police vehicles. PCSOs may only use blue lights when they come across an accident to indicate the danger present to members of the public, to alert the public to a road hazard and when asked to by a Senior Officer.

PCSOs also regularly use mountain bikes or other bicycles. Since 2007, PCSOs and police constables have had to take a training course before being allowed to use bicycles whilst on duty, after a trainee PCSO died after being hit by a truck in Wigan.

In 2007, Segways were reported to be used by Metropolitan Police Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNT) in Sutton. These teams consist mostly of PCSOs.

==Underage PCSOs==
In 2007, it was revealed that some forces recruited a large number of PCSOs under the legal recruitment age for police constables, which was 18 years and 6 months. The criterion seemed to be that such recruits must be at least 16 and their appointment must have been authorised by the chief constable of the force being applied to. One such officer of the Thames Valley Police Force, 17-year-old PCSO Nadia Naeem, made news. The decision to appoint her and other 16- and 17-year-olds has been the subject of much debate.

On 26 November 2007, the then-Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, made the decision that from December 2007, all PCSOs must be 18 before they can be appointed. PCSOs under 18 years who were already appointed, or had applied prior to this ruling, were allowed to keep their positions.

A few police forces including West Midlands Police, Cumbria Constabulary and the British Transport Police are accepting applications from candidates below 18 years owing to the lengthy recruitment process. Candidates will, therefore, be able to begin training upon reaching the required age.

==Deaths on duty==

Since their introduction in 2002, three PCSOs have died on duty:

* 31 January 2006, PCSO Adrian Martin, aged 45 – Metropolitan Police: Collapsed and died of heart failure while on a police cycle training course at Hendon Police College. He was the first PCSO to die on duty.
*10 September 2007, PCSO Chris Maclure, aged 21 – Greater Manchester Police (GMP): Died whilst on cycle patrol in Hindley Green Wigan when he was accidentally struck by a lorry. As a result of his death, safety was improved nationally for officers deployed on cycles. An award for GMP PCSOs the &#x27;PCSO Christopher McClure Memorial Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Community&#x27; was made in his honour.
*28 April 2009, PCSO David Leslie Adams, aged 59 – Avon and Somerset Constabulary: Died of a suspected heart attack whilst attending a road traffic collision whilst on duty in Woolverton near Frome. PCSO Adams had previously been a traffic warden with his force before becoming one of the constabulary&#x27;s first PCSOs. During his service he won an award in 2007 for outstanding customer service in the Somerset East District at the Avon and Somerset Community Police Awards.

The Police Roll of Honour Trust includes PCSOs in its roll of fallen officers alongside constables &quot;providing they die in operational circumstances (i.e., in the performance of a law enforcement role, including patrol)&quot;.

==Union and Police Federation membership status ==

PCSOs cannot by law be members of the Police Federation, the staff association to which, by statute, all regular police officers from the rank of Police Constable to that of Chief Inspector belong. Police officers cannot by law join any trade union, but as designated, unsworn, unwarranted officers, PCSOs can, despite being employed by the Police. Most PCSOs belong to UNISON. But other PCSOs are represented by PCS - Public and Commercial Services Union for PCSOs in the Metropolitan Police and TSSA - Transport Salaried Staffs&#x27; Association who represent PCSOs in the British Transport Police (BTP).

Unlike police constables, PCSOs can strike. This has occurred during the 2011 Public Sector Workers strike, which was partaken in by some PCSOs.
 Police constables, on the other hand, cannot legally strike as a result of the Police Act 1996, although they have not been able to strike since 1919 when it was first outlawed. Police Acts do not apply to PCSOs.

==Special constable membership status ==
Unlike other civilians employed by the police, PCSOs are usually not Special Constables, as this may cause confusion with their PCSO role, since Specials have the same powers as paid police constables. Any PCSO wishing to become a Special Constable would usually be required to resign and the same would apply for any Special Constable wanting to be a PCSO.

==Future==
It was expected that the Conservative Party might remove PCSOs in early 2010. It has been reported by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; that under the Conservatives, police chiefs will no longer be given a fixed amount of money to spend only on PCSOs. Before the 2010 General Election the then Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling was understood to be doubtful of the effectiveness of PCSOs and was concerned that a disproportionate number of them were disciplined in 2009. He stated he would leave it up to individual chief constables to decide whether their particular police force needs PCSOs. However, when interviewed by the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; in May 2009 he suggested that the Conservative Party may well scrap PCSOs altogether.

Since the 2010 general election held on 6 May 2010, which resulted in a Conservative Party led coalition government coming to power, no police force has disbanded or announced the disbanding of its PCSOs, and many forces have continued to recruit PCSOs after the 2010 election. Such forces include Durham Constabulary in December 2011 and British Transport Police (BTP) in June 2011. BTP in 2012 have decided to increase their overall numbers of PCSOs.
 The Metropolitan Police in February 2012 undertook a recruitment campaign to employ around 1000 additional PCSOs.

Chris Grayling, who was possibly considering reducing or disbanding PCSOs, was not made Home Secretary after the 2010 general election. Instead, he was appointed Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions.

In April 2012 Home Secretary Theresa May told a Home Affairs Select Committee she would leave PCSO funding and numbers to individual police forces although she did not announce any all-out plans to disband them.

During the England and Wales Police and Crime Commissioner elections, 2012 the UK Independence Party (UKIP) Candidate for the post of police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Norfolk Constabulary Matthew Smith stated he was doubtful of the effectiveness of PCSOs and wanted to reduce their numbers claiming during a debate on BBC Radio Norfolk in the run up to the election that the public in his opinion were not happy with PCSOs seeing them as &quot;Plastic Policemen&quot; During his campaign to be the PCC he stated he would prioritise recruitment to have more Police Constables and Special Constables rather than PCSOs.

All other PCC candidates for Norfolk Constabulary defended PCSOs and their role in the debate. The election for PCCs Matthew Smith is the only known candidate during the England and Wales Police and Crime Commissioner elections, 2012 who planned to reduce PCSO numbers. Although later in 2018 Norfolk Constabulary abolished its use of PCSOs and made all of its remaining PCSOs redundant.

==Similar programmes in other countries==
Several countries have copied or already have law enforcement positions that are similar to PCSOs in England and Wales. In some cases they take the form or are employed by Municipal Police. Municipal police are forces under the control of localised municipalities, which are other countries&#x27; versions of British local authorities or councils.

===Australia===
In Australia, most police forces have an equivalent role known as a PSO, standing variously for Protective Services Officer (Victoria Police), Protective Service Officer (Western Australia Police and Australian Federal Police), Police Security Officer (South Australia Police) or Protective Security Officer (Queensland Police). Except in Victoria, they are not sworn constables and have limited powers. At a federal level, the Australian Protective Service operated from 1984 until 2004, when it was re-integrated into the AFP and currently serves a primary role in policing Parliament House in Canberra, major airports, and certain diplomatic and defence installations.

In the state of Victoria, Protective Services Officers are sworn members of Victoria Police. PSOs attached to the Protective Services Unit (PSU) perform duties as guards at state Parliament, at the Shrine of Remembrance and at court premises throughout the state. PSOs attached to the Transit Safety Division (Transit PSOs) perform policing duties at all metropolitan and some regional railway premises throughout Victoria. Unlike PSOs assigned to the PSU, Transit PSOs possess almost full police powers while on duty and within the vicinity of railway premises. They are identified by the use of blue-and-gold Sillitoe tartan rather than blue-and-white and the text &quot;PROTECTIVE SERVICES&quot; on badges. All PSOs carry a firearm, ballistic body armour and all other personal equipment issued to police officers throughout Victoria. and pepper spray.

Queensland Police have Police Liaison Officers, members of staff employed by the police to keep links between the police and the local ethnic minority groups normally distant from the police such as Australia&#x27;s Aboriginal peoples, Asian groups and African communities. They wear the same blue uniform as Queensland Police officers, but have features on them to distinguish them such as yellow or blue/green epaulettes. They have no police powers and do not carry any weapons or accoutrements.

The Western Australia Police have Police Auxiliary Officers, members of staff who are employed to support WA Police Officers through the admission, custody and release of detainees in the Perth Watch House and other station based lock-ups. Other duties include managing and handling drugs and firearms, processing property and exhibits and a range of station support tasks. They wear maroon epaulettes and are not authorised to carry or use firearms; however, they do carry telescopic batons, handcuffs, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray and Tasers. They have limited police powers and training lasts only 12 weeks.

===Belgium===
In Belgium, Police Agents () serve at both the federal and local level. These uniformed Police Agents who have limited police powers to enforce traffic, parking and public nuisance laws.

Unlike Belgian Police Officers, Police Agents are unarmed but are equipped with handcuffs. They were originally known as &quot;Auxiliary Officers&quot;.

===Canada===
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police launched a Community Safety Officer (CSO) () programme based on the model in England and Wales. CSOs are given the title &quot;Special Constable&quot;. The first seventeen CSOs were sworn in on 16 June 2008 as part of a pilot programme, which lasted eighteen months. They did not carry pistols like fully powered officers in the RCMP, but they did carry handcuffs, pepper sprays and batons to protect themselves. The programmed disbanded in 2014 with a new program known as &quot;Community Constables&quot;.

In addition, many municipalities across Canada also employ a Municipal Bylaw Enforcement Officer or a number of them, to enforce municipal by-laws and some provincial laws regulating dangerous canines, tobacco use and motor vehicle traffic. Many Municipal Bylaw Enforcement Officers wear uniforms and some are issued batons and handcuffs. Municipal Bylaw Enforcement Officers are employed by the Municipality; however, some are directly by employed by police departments such as in Medicine Hat, Alberta and Toronto, Ontario.

===France===
French municipalities utilise officers called ASVP or Public Roads Control Officer (), who are not armed but carry handcuffs and utilise powers of arrest.

===Gibraltar===
In the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, Highways Enforcement Officers are employed by Gibraltar Car Parks Limited, a wholly owned Government Company of Her Majesty&#x27;s Government of Gibraltar. Like mainland British PCSOs they undertake uniformed patrols. They perform a very similar role to that of mainland British Traffic PCSO that various forces used to replace their Traffic Wardens (notably the Metropolitan Police). Unlike British PCSOs they are not employed by the Royal Gibraltar Police. As well as performing parking enforcement including the issuing of fines they also look after government owned car parks, look out for deficiencies in the public highways and enforce litter control laws including giving fines or summoning offenders. They are paid £20,325 rising to £24,345 per year subject to satisfactory performance, plus a 12.5% shift disturbance allowance and weekend premium.

===Germany===
In Germany, several agencies provide similar services like the PCSO: 

; Auxiliary police: some states established auxiliary police units as &quot;Voluntary Police Force (Freiwilliger Polizeidienst)&quot;, &quot;Security Watch (Sicherheitswacht)&quot; or &quot;Security Partner (Sicherheitspartner)&quot;. These services are intended to maintain or establish public security and order throughout their assigned territories.

; City police forces: (&quot;Stadtpolizei&quot;, &quot;Kommunalpolizei&quot; or &quot;Polizeibehörde&quot;) exist in few states like Bremen, Saarland, Baden-Württemberg and Hesse. Those municipal police officers do have the same rights, powers and obligations like their counterparts in the state police, but are employed by German municipalities.

; Municipal order enforcement agencies: depending on state laws and municipal regulations, they are named &quot;Kommunaler Ordnungsdienst (KOD)&quot; or &quot;Ordnungsamt&quot;. These city employees mainly wear police-like uniforms but some wear labelled jackets and plain clothes. They are the municipal administration&#x27;s eyes and ears on the street. Depending on each state&#x27;s laws, these local employees could be armed or unarmed. Mostly they are charged with monitoring municipal by-laws and laws that fall under the responsibility of municipalities, which include monitoring the conduct of shop owners, sanitation inspections, veterinary inspections and minor infractions and misdemeanors such as illegal parking, littering, state and local dog regulations etc. They usually only hand out warnings and fines and can only perform a citizen&#x27;s arrest as any other citizen can. If they see any major crimes they are required to call the state police. They usually hand out warnings and fines. Like British PCSOs, they have special powers of detention and can perform arrests.

===India===
In India the federal states determine the individual policing roles that can be handed over to volunteers. In the state of West Bengal, after 2012, around 120,000 personnel were inducted as contractual &#x27;Civic Volunteers&#x27; to assist the police with minor law and order duties like traffic management, managing helpdesks, crowd control etc. There have been several debates about the recrtuiment, training and usefulness of these volunteers. Several civic volunteers have been accused of excesses and crimes.

===Poland===

Straż Miejska () are municipal police officers who like British PCSOs have limited powers and are not as well armed as fully powered officers but are known to be equipped with batons, handcuffs, tear gas launchers and more recently tasers. There are also plans to allow them to carry handguns of a lesser calibre that the Polish National Police carry.

In the event of a major incident, they must request the aid of an officer of the National Police.

===Spain===
In some areas of Spain that are unable to have a local municipal police, their function is performed by the Guardia Civil or autonomous Community force who are assisted by officers known as &quot;Vigilantes Municipales&quot; who are uniformed municipal employees with limited powers.

===Sri Lanka===
The Government of Sri Lanka has proposed the formation of a Community Police Service (CPS) of 28,000 members to be deployed alongside Grama Niladhari (village officers) to resolve minor disputes and youth offenders. Mirroring the role of old Police Vidane in villages, two CPS members would allocated to each Grama Niladhari division and operate out of the village Grama Niladhari office instead of the local Police Station. Reporting to the State Minister for Community Police Services, this force would have local members serving in their own residential areas acting as intelligence officers for the state and work closely with local civil defence committees. The new recruits will have the same powers as a police constable, and have a similar rank structure up to the grate of Sergeant. Once promoted to the rank of Sub Inspector, they will be assigned other duties in the Sri Lanka Police.

===Thailand===
The Royal Thai Police formed the Phuket Tourist Police Department, staffed by Tourist Police Volunteers to deal with growing crime problems related to tourism in Thailand. Their role is to support police officers, helping tourists and patrolling mostly by foot.

They wear a different uniform but unlike British PCSOs, they carry pepper spray and batons in addition to handcuffs. They do not carry firearms as Thai police officers do.

A lot of their recruits are foreigners, to make relations easier between the police and tourists.

The Tourist Police Volunteers and their work were featured in the TV documentary &quot;Big Trouble in Thailand&quot;.

===The Netherlands===
In The Netherlands, there are municipal SEOs &quot;(Special enforcement officers)&quot;. These assist the police on certain pieces of the law. They could be working in cities as municipal code inspectors, parking enforcement, public transport or in environmental departments. These officers have police powers like detaining people, issue fines and use force when arresting a person. Most municipalities issue handcuffs to the officers, in some cities also police batons are a part of the officers equipment. In a few cities officers are allowed to carry and use pepper spray. Only a few cities have SEOs with additional schooling carrying a firearm, these officers a mostly employed in dense areas like forests. A SEO (or BOA in Dutch) has the status of civil servant and is not a uniformed civilian unlike security guards. Until 2014 every municipality could use a uniform of their choice, some wear exact police uniforms with peaked caps and blue trousers with black striping. From 2015 the justice ministry created a uniform specially for municipal enforcement. This consists of a polo shirt, worker trousers, baseball cap and soft-shell jackets and were inspired by the Spanish municipal police uniforms with checkers bands on shirts and hats.

The Dutch police also knows police volunteers, these are divided in two categories; administrative and operational. Operational officers have the same rank, uniform and weapons as regular police officers. There is practically no difference between them, besides their payment.

===United States===
Community Service Officers (CSO) have been used in the US since the 1970s by several police departments. These are unsworn uniformed civilians who provide support in crime prevention, investigation, and response where full police powers are unnecessary and assists sworn police officers in upholding law and order. They are not provided with any legal powers above and beyond a normal citizen. A major difference between this role and the UK equivalent is that the US counterparts are not dispatched to ongoing incidents.

Depending on the police department they work for they may be equipped with handcuffs, batons, pepper spray and tasers as possession of these items in the US is usually not considered being &#x27;armed&#x27;.

The term is also occasionally used for contractor hired individuals dealing with inebriated homeless individuals, as in Anchorage, Alaska They are dispatched via the central dispatch. Anchorage requires them to have EMT training.

==In fiction==
Despite being in recent years the more visible aspect of British policing, PCSOs have rarely been featured in fictional television programmes or films, but there are some examples that are the exception:

The 2008 British drama film &quot;Adulthood&quot; directed by Noel Clarke starred David Ajala as PCSO Desmond &quot;Buds&quot;.

The popular long-running British police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; featured two Metropolitan Police PCSO characters; PCSO Colin Fairfax played by Tim Steed and PCSO Laura Bryant played by Melanie Kilburn. Both started at the same time in episode 278. PCSO Bryant is shown eventually becoming a police constable, accurately portraying the fact that many PCSOs go on to become constables. After both PCSOs left neither was replaced and The Bill never again portrayed PCSOs despite their common presence in real life.

Paul Abbott&#x27;s long-running drama series &quot;Shameless&quot; occasionally features police community support officers. For example, in series 8 episode 19, a PCSO is seen getting out of a police vehicle and chasing Aidan Croker.

Hollyoaks the long-running British television soap opera, on Channel 4 featured for many years Carmel McQueen played by Gemma Merna who was portrayed as being a PCSO between 2009 and 2010.

PCSOs have also featured in a few comedy sketch programmes including Season 3, Episode 1 of &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot;.

PCSOs were featured in the BBC Radio 4 sitcom by Dave Lamb &quot;Hobby Bobbies&quot;.

In 2009 the long running children&#x27;s British comedy television series &quot;ChuckleVision&quot; featured PCSOs in Season 21, Episode 2 &quot;Top of the Cops&quot; where the shows main characters the Chuckle Brothers Paul &amp; Barry Chuckle are depicted as PCSOs fresh out of training sent out on patrol for the first time.

In 2015, a PCSO is shown guarding a crime scene on &quot;No Offence&quot;, episode 6, where he has a brief conversation with a Detective Inspector and Detective Constable.

In 2016, season 2 of the BBC series &quot;Happy Valley&quot; featured Ann Gallagher, played by Charlie Murphy, becoming a PCSO following the events of her kidnapping in the first season.

<doc id="846889" wikidata="Q6385175" url="?curid=846889" title="Keith Waldrop">
<text>Bernard Keith Waldrop (December 11, 1932 – July 27, 2023) was an American poet, translator, publisher, and academic. He won the National Book Award for Poetry for his 2009 collection &quot;Transcendental Studies: A Trilogy&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Bernard Keith Waldrop was born in Emporia, Kansas, to Arthur Waldrop, a railroad worker, and Opal (née Mohler), a piano teacher. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Kansas State Teachers College (now Emporia State University) and his M.A. and Ph.D. in comparative literature from the University of Michigan (1958, 1964). 

From 1953 to 1955, he served in the United States Army. He was stationed in West Germany, where he met Rosmarie Sebald. She emigrated to the United States and they were married in 1959.

==Academic career ==
From 1963 to 1964, while finishing his Ph.D., Waldrop worked as an instructor at Wayne State University, following which he was hired as a visiting assistant professor at Wesleyan University, where he taught between 1966-1967. He was hired as a professor of English by Brown University in 1968, where he taught for the remainder of his career for both the English and Literary Arts departments. After forty-three years of teaching he retired in 2011.

== Burning Deck Press ==
In 1961, Waldrop and his wife, Rosmarie Waldrop, founded Burning Deck, a small press specializing in the publication of experimental poetry and prose. The press was named after a line from the poem &quot;Casabianca,&quot; by nineteenth-century poet Felicia Hemans. The poem starts:

::The boy stood on the burning deck
::Whence all but he had fled;
::The flame that lit the battle&#x27;s wreck
::Shone round him o&#x27;er the dead.

==Death==
Keith Waldrop died in Providence, Rhode Island on July 27, 2023, at the age of 90.

<text>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) is an analytical method that combines the features of gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify different substances within a test sample. Applications of GC–MS include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis, explosives investigation, food and flavor analysis, and identification of unknown samples, including that of material samples obtained from planet Mars during probe missions as early as the 1970s. GC–MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, it can identify trace elements in materials that were previously thought to have disintegrated beyond identification. Like liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, it allows analysis and detection even of tiny amounts of a substance.

GC–MS has been regarded as a &quot;gold standard&quot; for forensic substance identification because it is used to perform a 100% specific test, which positively identifies the presence of a particular substance. A nonspecific test merely indicates that any of several in a category of substances is present. Although a nonspecific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance, this could lead to false positive identification. However, the high temperatures (300°C) used in the GC–MS injection port (and oven) can result in thermal degradation of injected molecules, thus resulting in the measurement of degradation products instead of the actual molecule(s) of interest. 

==History==
The first on-line coupling of gas chromatography to a mass spectrometer was reported in the late 1950s. An interest in coupling the methods had been suggested as early as December 1954, but conventional recording techniques had too poor temporal resolution. Fortunately, time-of-flight mass spectrometry developed around the same time allowed to measure spectra thousands times a second.

The development of affordable and miniaturized computers has helped in the simplification of the use of this instrument, as well as allowed great improvements in the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample. In 1964, Electronic Associates, Inc. (EAI), a leading U.S. supplier of analog computers, began development of a computer controlled quadrupole mass spectrometer under the direction of Robert E. Finnigan. By 1966 Finnigan and collaborator Mike Uthe&#x27;s EAI division had sold over 500 quadrupole residual gas-analyzer instruments. In 1967, Finnigan left EAI to form the Finnigan Instrument Corporation along with Roger Sant, T. Z. Chou, Michael Story, Lloyd Friedman, and William Fies. In early 1968, they delivered the first prototype quadrupole GC/MS instruments to Stanford and Purdue University. When Finnigan Instrument Corporation was acquired by Thermo Instrument Systems (later Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1990, it was considered &quot;the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of mass spectrometers&quot;.

==Instrumentation==
The GC–MS is composed of two major building blocks: the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph utilizes a capillary column whose properties regarding molecule separation depend on the column&#x27;s dimensions (length, diameter, film thickness) as well as the phase properties (e.g. 5% phenyl polysiloxane). The difference in the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture and their relative affinity for the stationary phase of the column will promote separation of the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column. The molecules are retained by the column and then elute (come off) from the column at different times (called the retention time), and this allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture, ionize, accelerate, deflect, and detect the ionized molecules separately. The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into ionized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass-to-charge ratio.
These two components, used together, allow a much finer degree of substance identification than either unit used separately. It is not possible to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame ionization detector) cannot differentiate between multiple molecules that happen to take the same amount of time to travel through the column (&quot;i.e.&quot; have the same retention time), which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC–MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.

===Purge and trap GC–MS===
For the analysis of volatile compounds, a purge and trap (P&amp;T) concentrator system may be used to introduce samples. The target analytes are extracted by mixing the sample with water and purge with inert gas (e.g. Nitrogen gas) into an airtight chamber, this is known as purging or sparging. The volatile compounds move into the headspace above the water and are drawn along a pressure gradient (caused by the introduction of the purge gas) out of the chamber. The volatile compounds are drawn along a heated line onto a &#x27;trap&#x27;. The trap is a column of adsorbent material at ambient temperature that holds the compounds by returning them to the liquid phase. The trap is then heated and the sample compounds are introduced to the GC–MS column via a volatiles interface, which is a split inlet system. P&amp;T GC–MS is particularly suited to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and BTEX compounds (aromatic compounds associated with petroleum).

A faster alternative is the &quot;purge-closed loop&quot; system. In this system the inert gas is bubbled through the water until the concentrations of organic compounds in the vapor phase are at equilibrium with concentrations in the aqueous phase. The gas phase is then analysed directly.

===Types of mass spectrometer detectors===
The most common type of mass spectrometer (MS) associated with a gas chromatograph (GC) is the quadrupole mass spectrometer, sometimes referred to by the Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) trade name &quot;Mass Selective Detector&quot; (MSD). Another relatively common detector is the ion trap mass spectrometer. Additionally one may find a magnetic sector mass spectrometer, however these particular instruments are expensive and bulky and not typically found in high-throughput service laboratories. Other detectors may be encountered such as time of flight (TOF), tandem quadrupoles (MS-MS) (see below), or in the case of an ion trap MSn where n indicates the number mass spectrometry stages.

===GC–tandem MS===
When a second phase of mass fragmentation is added, for example using a second quadrupole in a quadrupole instrument, it is called tandem MS (MS/MS). MS/MS can sometimes be used to quantitate low levels of target compounds in the presence of a high sample matrix background.

The first quadrupole (Q1) is connected with a collision cell (Q2) and another quadrupole (Q3). Both quadrupoles can be used in scanning or static mode, depending on the type of MS/MS analysis being performed. Types of analysis include product ion scan, precursor ion scan, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) (sometimes referred to as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)) and neutral loss scan. For example: When Q1 is in static mode (looking at one mass only as in SIM), and Q3 is in scanning mode, one obtains a so-called product ion spectrum (also called &quot;daughter spectrum&quot;). From this spectrum, one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen precursor ion. The pair is called a &quot;transition&quot; and forms the basis for SRM. SRM is highly specific and virtually eliminates matrix background.

==Ionization==
After the molecules travel the length of the column, pass through the transfer line and enter into the mass spectrometer they are ionized by various methods with typically only one method being used at any given time. Once the sample is fragmented it will then be detected, usually by an electron multiplier, which essentially turns the ionized mass fragment into an electrical signal that is then detected.

The ionization technique chosen is independent of using full scan or SIM.
===Electron ionization===
By far the most common and perhaps standard form of ionization is electron ionization (EI). The molecules enter into the MS (the source is a quadrupole or the ion trap itself in an ion trap MS) where they are bombarded with free electrons emitted from a filament, not unlike the filament one would find in a standard light bulb. The electrons bombard the molecules, causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic and reproducible way. This &quot;hard ionization&quot; technique results in the creation of more fragments of low mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and few, if any, molecules approaching the molecular mass unit. Hard ionization is considered by mass spectrometrists as the employ of molecular electron bombardment, whereas &quot;soft ionization&quot; is charge by molecular collision with an introduced gas. The molecular fragmentation pattern is dependent upon the electron energy applied to the system, typically 70 eV (electronvolts). The use of 70 eV facilitates comparison of generated spectra with library spectra using manufacturer-supplied software or software developed by the National Institute of Standards (NIST-USA). Spectral library searches employ matching algorithms such as Probability Based Matching and dot-product matching that are used with methods of analysis written by many method standardization agencies. Sources of libraries include NIST, Wiley, the AAFS, and instrument manufacturers.

====Cold electron ionization====
The &quot;hard ionization&quot; process of electron ionization can be softened by the cooling of the molecules before their ionization, resulting in mass spectra that are richer in information. In this method named cold electron ionization (cold-EI) the molecules exit the GC column, mixed with added helium make up gas and expand into vacuum through a specially designed supersonic nozzle, forming a supersonic molecular beam (SMB). Collisions with the make up gas at the expanding supersonic jet reduce the internal vibrational (and rotational) energy of the analyte molecules, hence reducing the degree of fragmentation caused by the electrons during the ionization process. Cold-EI mass spectra are characterized by an abundant molecular ion while the usual fragmentation pattern is retained, thus making cold-EI mass spectra compatible with library search identification techniques. The enhanced molecular ions increase the identification probabilities of both known and unknown compounds, amplify isomer mass spectral effects and enable the use of isotope abundance analysis for the elucidation of elemental formulas.

===Chemical ionization===

In chemical ionization (CI) a reagent gas, typically methane or ammonia is introduced into the mass spectrometer. Depending on the technique (positive CI or negative CI) chosen, this reagent gas will interact with the electrons and analyte and cause a &#x27;soft&#x27; ionization of the molecule of interest. A softer ionization fragments the molecule to a lower degree than the hard ionization of EI. One of the main benefits of using chemical ionization is that a mass fragment closely corresponding to the molecular weight of the analyte of interest is produced.

In positive chemical ionization (PCI) the reagent gas interacts with the target molecule, most often with a proton exchange. This produces the species in relatively high amounts.

In negative chemical ionization (NCI) the reagent gas decreases the impact of the free electrons on the target analyte. This decreased energy typically leaves the fragment in great supply.

==Analysis==
A mass spectrometer is typically utilized in one of two ways: full scan or selective ion monitoring (SIM). The typical GC–MS instrument is capable of performing both functions either individually or concomitantly, depending on the setup of the particular instrument.

The primary goal of instrument analysis is to quantify an amount of substance. This is done by comparing the relative concentrations among the atomic masses in the generated spectrum. Two kinds of analysis are possible, comparative and original. Comparative analysis essentially compares the given spectrum to a spectrum library to see if its characteristics are present for some sample in the library. This is best performed by a computer because there are a myriad of visual distortions that can take place due to variations in scale. Computers can also simultaneously correlate more data (such as the retention times identified by GC), to more accurately relate certain data. Deep learning was shown to lead to promising results in the identification of VOCs from raw GC–MS data.

Another method of analysis measures the peaks in relation to one another. In this method, the tallest peak is assigned 100% of the value, and the other peaks being assigned proportionate values. All values above 3% are assigned. The total mass of the unknown compound is normally indicated by the parent peak. The value of this parent peak can be used to fit with a chemical formula containing the various elements which are believed to be in the compound. The isotope pattern in the spectrum, which is unique for elements that have many natural isotopes, can also be used to identify the various elements present. Once a chemical formula has been matched to the spectrum, the molecular structure and bonding can be identified, and must be consistent with the characteristics recorded by GC–MS. Typically, this identification is done automatically by programs which come with the instrument, given a list of the elements which could be present in the sample.

A &quot;full spectrum&quot; analysis considers all the &quot;peaks&quot; within a spectrum. Conversely, selective ion monitoring (SIM) only monitors selected ions associated with a specific substance. This is done on the assumption that at a given retention time, a set of ions is characteristic of a certain compound. This is a fast and efficient analysis, especially if the analyst has previous information about a sample or is only looking for a few specific substances. When the amount of information collected about the ions in a given gas chromatographic peak decreases, the sensitivity of the analysis increases. So, SIM analysis allows for a smaller quantity of a compound to be detected and measured, but the degree of certainty about the identity of that compound is reduced.

===Full scan MS===
When collecting data in the full scan mode, a target range of mass fragments is determined and put into the instrument&#x27;s method. An example of a typical broad range of mass fragments to monitor would be &quot;m/z&quot; 50 to &quot;m/z&quot; 400. The determination of what range to use is largely dictated by what one anticipates being in the sample while being cognizant of the solvent and other possible interferences. A MS should not be set to look for mass fragments too low or else one may detect air (found as &quot;m/z&quot; 28 due to nitrogen), carbon dioxide (&quot;m/z&quot; 44) or other possible interference. Additionally if one is to use a large scan range then sensitivity of the instrument is decreased due to performing fewer scans per second since each scan will have to detect a wide range of mass fragments.

Full scan is useful in determining unknown compounds in a sample. It provides more information than SIM when it comes to confirming or resolving compounds in a sample. During instrument method development it may be common to first analyze test solutions in full scan mode to determine the retention time and the mass fragment fingerprint before moving to a SIM instrument method.

===Selective ion monitoring===
In selective ion monitoring (SIM) certain ion fragments are entered into the instrument method and only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer. The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at a small number of fragments (e.g. three fragments) during each scan. More scans can take place each second. Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored, matrix interferences are typically lower. To additionally confirm the likelihood of a potentially positive result, it is relatively important to be sure that the ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known reference standard.

==Applications==

===Environmental monitoring and cleanup===
GC–MS is becoming the tool of choice for tracking organic pollutants in the environment. The cost of GC–MS equipment has decreased significantly, and the reliability has increased at the same time, which has contributed to its increased adoption in environmental studies.

===Criminal forensics===
GC–MS can analyze the particles from a human body in order to help link a criminal to a crime. The analysis of fire debris using GC–MS is well established, and there is even an established American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard for fire debris analysis. GCMS/MS is especially useful here as samples often contain very complex matrices, and results used in court need to be highly accurate.

===Law enforcement===
GC–MS is increasingly used for detection of illegal narcotics, and may eventually supplant drug-sniffing dogs.[1] A simple and selective GC–MS method for detecting marijuana usage was recently developed by the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. It involves identifying an acid metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana, in urine samples by employing derivatization in the sample preparation. GC–MS is also commonly used in forensic toxicology to find drugs and/or poisons in biological specimens of suspects, victims, or the deceased. In drug screening, GC–MS methods frequently utilize liquid-liquid extraction as a part of sample preparation, in which target compounds are extracted from blood plasma.

===Sports anti-doping analysis===
GC–MS is the main tool used in sports anti-doping laboratories to test athletes&#x27; urine samples for prohibited performance-enhancing drugs, for example anabolic steroids.

===Security===
A post–September 11 development, explosive detection systems have become a part of all US airports. These systems run on a host of technologies, many of them based on GC–MS. There are only three manufacturers certified by the FAA to provide these systems, one of which is Thermo Detection (formerly Thermedics), which produces the EGIS, a GC–MS-based line of explosives detectors. The other two manufacturers are Barringer Technologies, now owned by Smith&#x27;s Detection Systems, and Ion Track Instruments, part of General Electric Infrastructure Security Systems.

===Chemical warfare agent detection===
As part of the post-September 11 drive towards increased capability in homeland security and public health preparedness, traditional GC–MS units with transmission quadrupole mass spectrometers, as well as those with cylindrical ion trap (CIT-MS) and toroidal ion trap (T-ITMS) mass spectrometers have been modified for field portability and near real-time detection of chemical warfare agents (CWA) such as sarin, soman, and VX. These complex and large GC–MS systems have been modified and configured with resistively heated low thermal mass (LTM) gas chromatographs that reduce analysis time to less than ten percent of the time required in traditional laboratory systems. Additionally, the systems are smaller, and more mobile, including units that are mounted in mobile analytical laboratories (MAL), such as those used by the United States Marine Corps Chemical and Biological Incident Response Force MAL and other similar laboratories, and systems that are hand-carried by two-person teams or individuals, much ado to the smaller mass detectors. Depending on the system, the analytes can be introduced via liquid injection, desorbed from sorbent tubes through a thermal desorption process, or with solid-phase micro extraction (SPME).

=== Chemical engineering ===
GC–MS is used for the analysis of unknown organic compound mixtures. One critical use of this technology is the use of GC–MS to determine the composition of bio-oils processed from raw biomass. GC–MS is also utilized in the identification of continuous phase component in a smart material, magnetorheological (MR) fluid.

=== Food, beverage and perfume analysis ===
Foods and beverages contain numerous aromatic compounds, some naturally present in the raw materials and some forming during processing. GC–MS is extensively used for the analysis of these compounds which include esters, fatty acids, alcohols, aldehydes, terpenes etc. It is also used to detect and measure contaminants from spoilage or adulteration which may be harmful and which is often controlled by governmental agencies, for example pesticides.

===Astrochemistry===
Several GC–MS systems have left earth. Two were brought to Mars by the Viking program. Venera 11 and 12 and Pioneer Venus analysed the atmosphere of Venus with GC–MS. The Huygens probe of the Cassini–Huygens mission landed one GC–MS on Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan. The MSL Curiosity rover&#x27;s Sample analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument contains both a gas chromatograph and quadrupole mass spectrometer that can be used in tandem as a GC–MS. The material in the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko was analysed by the Rosetta mission with a chiral GC–MS in 2014.

===Medicine===
Dozens of congenital metabolic diseases also known as inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are now detectable by newborn screening tests, especially the testing using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. GC–MS can determine compounds in urine even in minor concentration. These compounds are normally not present but appear in individuals suffering with metabolic disorders. This is increasingly becoming a common way to diagnose IEM for earlier diagnosis and institution of treatment eventually leading to a better outcome. It is now possible to test a newborn for over 100 genetic metabolic disorders by a urine test at birth based on GC–MS.

In combination with isotopic labeling of metabolic compounds, the GC–MS is used for determining metabolic activity. Most applications are based on the use of 13C as the labeling and the measurement of 13C-12C ratios with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS); an MS with a detector designed to measure a few select ions and return values as ratios.

<text>Harold Eugene Clark (November 17, 1944 – May 24, 1991) was an American singer-songwriter and founding member of the folk rock band the Byrds. He was the Byrds&#x27; principal songwriter between 1964 and early 1966, writing most of the band&#x27;s best-known originals from this period, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;, &quot;She Don&#x27;t Care About Time&quot;, &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; and &quot;Set You Free This Time&quot;. Although he did not achieve commercial success as a solo artist, Clark was in the vanguard of popular music during much of his career, prefiguring developments in such disparate subgenres as psychedelic rock, baroque pop, newgrass, country rock, and alternative country. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Byrds.

==Biography==
===Life===
Clark was born in Tipton, Missouri, the third of 13 children in a family of Irish, German, and Native American heritage. His family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where as a boy he began learning to play the guitar and harmonica from his father. He was soon playing Hank Williams tunes as well as songs by early rockers such as Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers. He began writing songs at the age of 11. By the time he was 15, he had developed a rich tenor voice, and he formed a local rock and roll combo, Joe Meyers and the Sharks. Like many of his generation, Clark developed an interest in folk music because of the popularity of The Kingston Trio. When he graduated from Bonner Springs High School, in Bonner Springs, Kansas, in 1962, he formed a folk group, the Rum Runners.

===Formation of the Byrds===

Clark was invited to join an established regional folk band, the Surf Riders, based in Kansas City at the Castaways Lounge, owned by Hal Harbaum. On August 12, 1963, he was performing with them when he was discovered by the New Christy Minstrels. They hired him, and he recorded two albums with the ensemble before leaving in early 1964. After hearing the Beatles, Clark quit the New Christy Minstrels and moved to Los Angeles, where he met fellow folkie and Beatles convert Jim (later Roger) McGuinn at the Troubadour Club. In early 1964 they began to assemble a band that would become the Byrds.

Clark wrote or co-wrote many of the Byrds&#x27; best-known originals from their first three albums, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;, &quot;Set You Free This Time&quot;, &quot;Here Without You&quot;, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Have to Cry&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, &quot;The World Turns All Around Her&quot;, &quot;She Don&#x27;t Care About Time&quot; and &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;. He initially played rhythm guitar in the band, but relinquished that position to David Crosby and became the tambourine and harmonica player. Bassist Chris Hillman noted years later in an interview remembering Clark, &quot;At one time, he was the power in the Byrds, not McGuinn, not Crosby—it was Gene who would burst through the stage curtain banging on a tambourine, coming on like a young Prince Valiant. A hero, our savior. Few in the audience could take their eyes off this presence. He &quot;was&quot; the songwriter. He had the &#x27;gift&#x27; that none of the rest of us had developed yet... What deep inner part of his soul conjured up songs like &#x27;Set You Free This Time,&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;ll Feel A Whole Lot Better,&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; Higher,&#x27; &#x27;Eight Miles High&#x27;? So many great songs! We learned a lot of songwriting from him and in the process learned a little bit about ourselves.&quot;

A management decision gave McGuinn the lead vocals for their major singles and Bob Dylan songs. This disappointment, combined with Clark&#x27;s dislike of traveling (including a chronic fear of flying) and resentment by other band members about the extra income he derived from his songwriting, led to internal squabbling, and he left the group in early 1966. He briefly returned to Kansas City before moving back to Los Angeles to form Gene Clark &amp; the Group with Chip Douglas, Joel Larson, and Bill Rhinehart.

===Solo career, brief return to the Byrds and Dillard and Clark===
Columbia Records (the Byrds&#x27; record label) signed Clark as a solo artist, and in 1967 he released his first solo album, &quot;Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers&quot;. The Gosdin Brothers were selected to back him because they shared the same manager, Jim Dickson, and because Chris Hillman, who played bass on the album, had worked with the Gosdin Brothers in the mid-1960s when he and they were members of the Southern California bluegrass band the Hillmen. The album was a unique mixture of pop, country rock and baroque psychedelic tracks. It received favorable reviews, but unfortunately for Clark, it was released almost simultaneously with the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;, also on Columbia, and (partly because of his 18-month absence from public attention) was a commercial failure.

With the future of his solo career in doubt, Clark briefly rejoined the Byrds in October 1967 as a replacement for the recently departed David Crosby; following an anxiety attack in Minneapolis, he left after only three weeks. During this brief period with the Byrds, he appeared with the band on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, lip-synching the group&#x27;s current single, &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;; he also performed &quot;Mr. Spaceman&quot; with the band. Although there is some disagreement among the band&#x27;s biographers, Clark is generally viewed as having contributed background vocals to the songs &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; and &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; for the forthcoming Byrds&#x27; album &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; and was an uncredited co-author, with McGuinn, of &quot;Get to You&quot;, also from that album.

In 1968, Clark signed with A&amp;M Records and began a collaboration with the banjo player Doug Dillard. Guitarist Bernie Leadon (later with The Flying Burrito Brothers and The Eagles), bassist Dave Jackson and mandolinist Don Beck joined them to form the nucleus of Dillard &amp; Clark; in addition, Michael Clarke briefly drummed for the group before joining The Flying Burrito Brothers. They produced two albums, &quot;The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard &amp; Clark&quot; (1968) and &quot;Through the Morning, Through the Night&quot; (1969).

&quot;The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard &amp; Clark&quot; was a pivotal work of acoustic country rock. It included such enduring songs as &quot;Train Leaves Here This Morning&quot; (a collaboration between Clark and Leadon prominently covered by the latter in 1972 on The Eagles&#x27; debut album) and &quot;She Darked the Sun&quot; (covered by Linda Ronstadt on her 1970 album &quot;Silk Purse&quot;). In contrast, &quot;Through the Morning, Through the Night&quot; was more indebted to traditional bluegrass but also employed electric instrumentation. By this juncture, Dillard&#x27;s girlfriend Donna Washburn had joined the group as a backing vocalist, a factor that precipitated the departure of Leadon. The shift to traditional bluegrass also caused Clark to lose interest. Written by Clark, the title song was used by Quincy Jones in the soundtrack of the 1972 Sam Peckinpah film &quot;The Getaway&quot;; it was also covered by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss (along with &quot;Polly,&quot; another Clark-penned track from the album) on their 2007 album &quot;Raising Sand&quot;. Both albums by Dillard &amp; Clark fared poorly on the charts, but they are now regarded as seminal exemplars of the country rock and progressive bluegrass genres.
The collaboration with Dillard rejuvenated Clark&#x27;s creativity but greatly contributed to his growing drinking problem. Dillard &amp; Clark disintegrated in late 1969 after the departures of Clark and Leadon. During this period, Clark, Leadon, Jackson and Beck contributed to the debut album of Steve Young, &quot;Rock Salt &amp; Nails,&quot; released in November 1969.

In 1970, Clark began work on a new single, recording two tracks with the original members of the Byrds (each recording his part separately). The resulting songs, &quot;She&#x27;s the Kind of Girl&quot; and &quot;One in a Hundred&quot;, were not released at the time, because of legal problems; they were included later on the 1973 album &quot;Roadmaster&quot;. In 1970 and 1971, Clark contributed vocals and two compositions (&quot;Tried So Hard&quot; and &quot;Here Tonight&quot;) to albums by the Flying Burrito Brothers.

Frustrated with the music industry, Clark bought a house in Albion, California and married former go-go dancer and Bell Records production assistant Carlie Lynn McCummings in June 1970, with whom he had two sons (Kelly and Kai Clark). In semi-retirement, he subsisted on his still-substantial Byrds royalties throughout the early 1970s, augmented by income from The Turtles&#x27; 1969 American Top Ten hit &quot;You Showed Me&quot;, a previously unreleased composition by McGuinn and Clark from 1964 rearranged for the band by Chip Douglas.

===&quot;White Light&quot; and &quot;Roadmaster&quot;===
In 1971, Clark released his second solo album, &quot;White Light&quot; (the title was not on the cover sleeve, and thus some later reviewers mistakenly assumed that the title was &quot;Gene Clark&quot;). The album was produced by the Native American guitarist Jesse Ed Davis, with whom Clark developed a great rapport, partly due to their common ancestry. An intimate, poetic and mostly acoustic work supplemented by Davis&#x27;s slide guitar, the album contained many introspective tracks, such as &quot;With Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Because of You&quot;, &quot;Where My Love Lies Asleep&quot; and &quot;For a Spanish Guitar&quot; (which Bob Dylan reportedly hailed as one of the greatest songs ever written). All of the material was written by Clark, with the exception of Bob Dylan and Richard Manuel&#x27;s &quot;Tears of Rage&quot;. Launched to considerable critical acclaim, the album failed to gain commercial success, except in the Netherlands, where it was voted album of the year by rock music critics. Once more, modest promotion and Clark&#x27;s refusal to undertake promotional touring adversely affected sales.

In the spring of 1971, Clark was commissioned by Dennis Hopper to contribute the tracks &quot;American Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Outlaw Song&quot; to &quot;American Dreamer&quot;, a documentary that chronicled the fractious editing process of &quot;The Last Movie&quot;. A rerecorded, longer version of the song &quot;American Dreamer&quot; was later used in the 1977 film &quot;The Farmer&quot;, along with an instrumental version of the same song plus &quot;Outside the Law (The Outlaw)&quot;, a re-recording of &quot;Outlaw Song&quot;.

In 1972, Clark attempted to record a follow-up album. Progress was slow and expensive, and A&amp;M terminated the project before completion. The resulting eight tracks, including &quot;Full Circle Song&quot; and &quot;In a Misty Morning&quot;, along with those recorded with the Byrds in 1970 and 1971 (&quot;She&#x27;s the Kind of Girl&quot; and &quot;One in a Hundred&quot;) and with the Flying Burrito Brothers (&quot;Here Tonight&quot;), were released in 1973 as &quot;Roadmaster&quot; in the Netherlands only.

===&quot;Byrds&quot;===
Clark left A&amp;M in late 1972 to join a reunion of the original five Byrds. They cut the album &quot;Byrds&quot;, which was released in March 1973 by Asylum Records. While the album charted relatively well (U.S. No. 20), its placement did not live up to the label&#x27;s initial expectations in the wake of the recent success of Crosby (Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young) and Hillman (a member of Stephen Stills&#x27;s band Manassas). Clark&#x27;s compositions &quot;Full Circle&quot; and &quot;Changing Heart&quot; and the Neil Young covers on which he sang the lead vocal (&quot;See the Sky About to Rain&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot;) were widely regarded as the standout tracks on the critically divisive album. Disheartened by the bad reviews and unhappy with Crosby&#x27;s performance as the record&#x27;s producer, the group members chose to dissolve the band. Clark briefly joined McGuinn&#x27;s solo group, with which he premiered &quot;Silver Raven&quot;, arguably his most celebrated post-Byrds song.

===&quot;No Other&quot;===
On the basis of the quality of Clark&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Byrds&quot;, David Geffen signed him to Asylum Records in early 1974. The label was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singer-songwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that Clark hadn&#x27;t experienced since his days with the Byrds. While composing the album, he spent long periods with a notebook and an acoustic guitar at the picture window of his home, deriving inspiration from staring at the Pacific Ocean.

Produced by Thomas Jefferson Kaye with a vast array of session musicians (including members of The Section and the Allman Brothers Band) and backing singers, the ensuing &quot;No Other&quot; fused elements of country rock, folk, gospel, soul and choral music with poetic, mystical lyrics. Although the album was praised by critics, its unconventional arrangements (which anticipated the later innovations of Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie) limited public appeal. Furthermore, its high production costs (exceeding $100,000) prompted Geffen to publicly berate Clark and Kaye. The album was minimally promoted and stalled in the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart at No. 144. In 2013, members of the bands Beach House, The Walkmen, Grizzly Bear, and Fleet Foxes performed the album in its entirety in a series of concerts.

Clark&#x27;s return to Los Angeles to record the album resulted in his reversion to a hedonistic lifestyle and accelerated the disintegration of his marriage. Disillusioned by professional and marital failure, he mounted his first solo tour by road, playing colleges and clubs with Roger White (lead guitar and backing vocals) and Duke Bardwell (electric bass, backing vocals and acoustic guitar); the drumless trio was billed as Gene Clark and the Silverados.

In 2019, a remastered/remixed version of &quot;No Other&quot; was released.

===&quot;Two Sides to Every Story&quot;===
After the commercial failure of &quot;No Other&quot;, Clark was confused about his artistic direction. Throughout 1975 and 1976, he had hinted to the press that he was assembling a set of &quot;cosmic&quot; songs fusing country rock with R&amp;B and funk, elaborating on the soundscapes of his most recent album. In 1976, he recorded a set of ten demos that combined country and folk music with a light touch of cosmic consciousness. These were submitted to RSO Records, which promptly bought out Clark&#x27;s Asylum contract and issued the long-gestating &quot;Two Sides to Every Story&quot; in 1977. The album—a melange of bluegrass, traditional honky tonk, echoes of &quot;No Other&quot; (&quot;Sister Moon&quot;) and strident country rock (a new arrangement of &quot;Kansas City Southern&quot;)—was produced by Kaye with an understated touch.

The emotional fallout from his divorce is reflected in the album title and several of Clark&#x27;s compositions, including the aforementioned &quot;Sister Moon&quot;, &quot;Lonely Saturday&quot;, &quot;Past Addresses&quot;, &quot;Silent Crusade&quot; and &quot;Hear the Wind&quot;. The album also contains covers of the traditional &quot;In the Pines&quot; (a key component of Clark&#x27;s live repertoire with the Silverados) and &quot;Give My Love to Marie&quot; by James Talley. Once again, his style of sensitive balladry failed to achieve success on the U.S. charts. In a belated attempt to find an appreciative public, he reluctantly overcame his travel anxiety and launched an international promotional tour with the KC Southern Band. Some six weeks before his death in 1991, Clark told interviewer Bill Wasserzieher that he considered &quot;Two Sides to Every Story&quot; his best album, rivaled only by &quot;No Other&quot;.

===&quot;McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman&quot;===
For his British tour dates, Clark found himself on the same bill as ex-Byrds Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman, each fronting their own bands. Shortly after returning to the United States, Clark and McGuinn began touring as an acoustic duo. After Hillman joined his former bandmates, the reformed trio named themselves McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman and signed with Capitol Records. Produced by the Albert Brothers (who had recently recorded Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&#x27;s 1977 comeback album), the ensuing &quot;McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman&quot; (1979) was a rebirth in both performing and songwriting for Clark, who ensconced himself as the group&#x27;s dominant creative force. He wrote four songs for the album, including &quot;Backstage Pass&quot; (a rumination on the ennui of touring and his fear of flying), &quot;Release Me Girl&quot; (a disco-inflected collaboration with Thomas Jefferson Kaye), the UFO-inspired &quot;Feelin&#x27; Higher&quot; and &quot;Little Mama&quot;.

Many critics felt that the album&#x27;s slick production and disco-influenced soft rock rhythms didn&#x27;t flatter the group, but the album reached No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (underpinned by the McGuinn-penned &quot;Don&#x27;t You Write Her Off&quot;, which peaked at No. 33 in May 1979) and earned a RIAA gold certification, selling well enough to generate a follow-up. McGuinn, Clark and Hillman&#x27;s second release was to have been a full group effort entitled &quot;City&quot;; although it was ultimately released in 1980, a combination of Clark&#x27;s unreliability (including experimentation with heroin) and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction (mostly regarding Ron and Howard Albert&#x27;s production) resulted in the album being credited to &quot;Roger McGuinn &amp; Chris Hillman featuring Gene Clark.&quot; Despite the turmoil, Clark penned the song &quot;Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot;. By 1981, Clark had left, and the group recorded one more album as &quot;McGuinn/Hillman&quot;.

===Rehabilitation, &quot;Firebyrd&quot; and &quot;So Rebellious a Lover&quot;===
Clark moved to Hawaii with Jesse Ed Davis to try to overcome his drug dependency, remaining there until the end of 1981. Upon his return to Los Angeles, he assembled a new band, the Firebyrds, and in 1982 proceeded to record what would eventually become the album &quot;Firebyrd&quot;. While waiting for the album to be released, Clark joined up with Chris Hillman and others in an abortive venture called Flyte, which failed to secure a recording contract and was quickly dissolved. The eventual release of &quot;Firebyrd&quot; in 1984 coincided with the emergence of jangle rockers like R.E.M. and Tom Petty, who had sparked a new interest in the Byrds. Clark also began developing new fans among LA&#x27;s roots-conscious Paisley Underground scene. Later in the decade, he embraced his new status by appearing as a guest with the Long Ryders, in a session arranged by Saul Davis and he cut an acclaimed duo album with Carla Olson of the Textones titled &quot;So Rebellious a Lover&quot; (including the notable &quot;Gypsy Rider&quot; and &quot;Del Gato&quot;) in 1986. The album included contributions from Chris Hillman, Stephen McCarthy (of The Long Ryders) and Randy Fuller (of the Bobby Fuller Four) and was produced and arranged by session drummer Michael Huey.

===Later career, illness and death===
In 1985, Clark approached McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman regarding a reformation of the Byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. The three of them showed no interest. Clark decided to assemble a &quot;superstar&quot; collection of musicians, including ex-Flying Burrito Brothers and Firefall member Rick Roberts, ex-Beach Boys singer and guitarist Blondie Chaplin, ex-Band members Rick Danko and Richard Manuel, and ex-Byrds Michael Clarke and John York. Clark initially called his band &quot;The 20th Anniversary Tribute to the Byrds&quot; and began performing on the lucrative nostalgia circuit in early 1985. A number of concert promoters began to shorten the band&#x27;s name to &quot;the Byrds&quot; in advertisements and promotional material. As the band continued to tour throughout 1985, their agent decided to shorten the name to &quot;the Byrds&quot; permanently, to the displeasure of McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman. Clark eventually discontinued performing with his own &quot;Byrds&quot; band, but drummer Clarke continued on with Skip Battin (occasionally with ex-Byrds York and Gene Parsons), forming another &quot;Byrds&quot; group, prompting McGuinn, Hillman, and Crosby to go on the road as &quot;the Byrds&quot; in an attempt to establish a claim to the rights to the name. Their effort failed this time; Clark was not included in the reunion, primarily because of his involvement with the act that didn&#x27;t include them. Crosby finally secured rights to the name in 2002.

Despite the critical success of &quot;So Rebellious a Lover&quot;, which led to several TV appearances (including &quot;Nashville Now&quot;), Clark was increasingly afflicted with serious health problems, including ulcers and alcohol dependence. In 1988, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant ulcer.

A period of abstinence and recovery followed until Tom Petty covered &quot;I&#x27;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot; on &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; (1989), yielding a windfall of royalties from the album (which peaked at No. 3 in the United States) to Clark. Flush with money, he began to neglect his professional obligations. Although the circumstances remain nebulous (with Carla Olson citing alleged financial improprieties), the binge also precipitated his final break-up with Terri Messina, who had had a two-decade on-again, off-again relationship with Clark.

During this period, The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1991, at which the original lineup performed several songs together, including Clark&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;.

Clark&#x27;s health continued to decline as his substance abuse accelerated, and he was diagnosed with throat cancer in early 1991. He died on May 24, 1991, at the age of 46 from heart disease as a result of a bleeding ulcer. Drug and alcohol addiction were determined to have contributed to his death. He was buried at St. Andrews Catholic Cemetery in Tipton, Missouri, beneath an epitaph that reads &quot;No Other.&quot;

===Covers and tribute songs===
During his career and after his death, Clark&#x27;s songs have been covered by a number of artists. Iain Matthews was an early promoter of Clark&#x27;s songs, covering &quot;Polly&quot; on his 1972 album &quot;Journeys from Gospel Oak&quot; and &quot;Tried So Hard&quot; on his 1974 album &quot;Some Days You Eat the Bear&quot;. &quot;Tried So Hard&quot; was later covered by Yo la Tengo on &quot;Fakebook&quot; in 1990. Death in Vegas and Paul Weller covered his song &quot;So You Say You Lost Your Baby&quot; on their 2003 album &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;. In 1993 the Scottish band Teenage Fanclub recorded a tribute entitled &quot;Gene Clark&quot; on their album &quot;Thirteen&quot;.

In 2007, two of his songs were recorded by Alison Krauss and Robert Plant on the T-Bone Burnett–produced &quot;Raising Sand&quot;: &quot;Polly Come Home&quot; and &quot;Through the Morning, Through the Night.&quot; Also in 2007, Chris and Rich Robinson released a live version of &quot;Polly&quot; on their album &quot;Brothers of a Feather: Live at the Roxy&quot;. This Mortal Coil covered &quot;Strength of Strings&quot; from his album &quot;No Other&quot; and &quot;With Tomorrow&quot; from his album &quot;White Light&quot;. Soulsavers with Mark Lanegan recorded a version of &quot;Some Misunderstanding&quot; from &quot;No Other&quot; on their 2009 release, &quot;Broken&quot;. The song &quot;Gorgeous&quot; from Kanye West&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot; is based on elements of The Turtles&#x27; cover of &quot;You Showed Me&quot;.

==Documentary==
A documentary about Clark&#x27;s life and career, entitled &quot;The Byrd Who Flew Alone&quot;, was released in 2013, featuring contributions from family, friends, the three surviving original members of the Byrds, latter-day Byrd John York and late-era collaborators Carla Olson and Pat Robinson. The documentary revealed that Clark was suffering from throat cancer at the time of his death.

<doc id="846910" wikidata="Q6002" url="?curid=846910" title="United Rugby Championship">
<text>The United Rugby Championship (URC) is an annual rugby union competition involving professional teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, South Africa, and Wales. For sponsorship reasons the league is known as the Vodacom United Rugby Championship in South Africa, and the BKT United Rugby Championship in the competition&#x27;s other territories, the split branding mirroring the format previously adopted in Super Rugby. The Championship represents the highest level of domestic club or franchise rugby in each of its constituent countries.

The Championship is one of the three major professional leagues in Europe (along with the English Premiership and the French Top 14), the most successful teams from which go forward to compete in the highest-level continental club competitions, the European Rugby Champions Cup and Challenge Cup. Since 2022–23, despite the name, South African teams have been eligible to qualify for European competitions.

==Name==

The tournament has had a number of names as it has grown, both organisationally and because of sponsors. The current name for the tournament was adopted in 2021, when the league expanded to include four South African teams previously from the SANZAR Super Rugby competition and both sets of naming rights, BKT and Vodacom, were added in the 2022-23 season.
Beginning with the creation of the Welsh–Scottish League in 1999, the league became known as the Celtic League when it grew to include teams from Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The league was sponsored by Irish cider makers Magners from the 2006–07 season until 2010–11, and was referred to as the Magner&#x27;s League. At the start of the 2010–11 season, the league expanded from 10 to 12 teams, adding two Italian teams.

Following the end of Magners&#x27; sponsorship, the league was sponsored by RaboDirect from 2011–12 through to 2013–14. The Pro12 name was adopted in 2011 to reflect that the league now included teams from outside the Celtic nations. A further expansion to 14 teams (and the subsequent renaming to Pro14) took place from the 2017–18 season, with two South African teams joining the Championship until the 2019–20 season. The sponsorship deal with Guinness began at the beginning of the 2014–15 season as the Guinness Pro14 , and concluded after the Guinness Pro14 Rainbow Cup in July 2021. Following the rebranding to the United Rugby Championship or the URC for short, the league formed a new partnership with Roc Nation. BKT and Vodacom secured naming rights the following season.

==Tournament format==
===Current format===
As of 2021–22, the championship season takes place between September and May, with teams split into four regional pools: The Irish Shield pool, the Welsh Shield pool, the South African Shield pool and the Scottish and Italian Shield pool for the purpose of fixture setting.

Teams play each of the other teams in their pool twice (home and away) and each team from the other pools once (either home or away). This ensures that Irish, South African and Welsh teams each play six derby matches. For Italy and Scotland, their respective clubs play their own nations&#x27; sides only twice. All teams are sorted in a single league table.

This creates an 18-match regular season before the play-offs, essentially a full single round robin with three additional &#x27;derby ties&#x27; (or one extra derby and two extra Scottish-Italians ties in that pool). The play-offs are made up of the top eight teams, and consist of a straight knockout tournament. Teams are seeded 1–8 and the highest-seeded teams receive home advantage. The final is held in a pre-arranged venue.

Championship points are awarded using the bonus points system; 4 points for a win and 2 for a draw. Bonus points can be earned so long as teams either score four or more tries in a game or lose by seven points or fewer – should a team do both, two bonus points are gained.

As for European qualification, the South African teams are eligible for European competition. As of 2023, the top eight teams qualify for the Champions Cup, with the remaining teams qualifying for the Challenge Cup.

With three fewer regular season fixtures than in the Pro14, but with an extra round of playoffs, the season is truncated slightly to 21 match weeks and thus can still be scheduled to the same time period as previous models of the competition. Clashes between league matches and international weekends in November and during the Six Nations Championship have been reduced.

Due to the travelling distance between Europe and South Africa, home South African games are always played on a Saturday, allowing visiting teams to have a seven-day turnaround between fixtures, including five &quot;clean days&quot; that do not involve any travel. Should the draw see European teams play both South African teams away, the schedule will see the away team play the two matches back-to-back across two weeks, acting as a &quot;mini-tour&quot;.

On 24 September 2021, URC confirmed that the top side in each regional pool after the end of the 18-game regular season would be awarded a trophy, a regional Shield. In Ireland, Wales and South Africa, this shield (the URC Irish Shield, URC Welsh Shield and URC South African Shield respectively) functions as an informal national championship title for the main professional sides, while in Scotland and Italy&#x27;s shared pool, it will be a joint regional trophy. The concept is comparable to the Divisional Championships in the NFL which are also loosely geographically based. For the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 seasons, the winners of each Shield were decided on the basis of all 18 regular season games played, and also guaranteed qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup, regardless of their overall league position. However, since the start of the 2023-2024 season, this was no longer the case and the top eight teams in the league would qualify for Europe regardless of Shield position. In addition, the winners of the each Shield would be determined by the games played amongst the teams within their regional group, reaffirming its status as a specifically national championship. In Scotland, the &#x27;national&#x27; trophy is considered to be the 1872 Cup played exclusively between the two Scottish clubs, usually as a double header over the Christmas and New Year periods. Derby games have become a tradition in all five member nations over this holiday period, with most home teams achieving bumper crowds for the matches.

===Format history===
The league has used a play-off structure since the 2009–10 season to determine the champions, similar to that used in the English Premiership. For the first two seasons there were two groups and a knockout to determine a winner. Starting from the 2003–04 season until the 2008–09 season, the champions were determined from league performance, with all the teams in one league. From the 2017–18 season, the regular season employed a conference structure rather than a single round robin league, with &#x27;derby games&#x27; between teams from the same nation being protected, and an expanded playoff structure. This allowed the competition to control the calendar, and control the number of games per team.

League points are awarded using the bonus points system. Until and including the 2008–09 season, the champions were decided solely on the basis of who finished top of the league table, but since the 2009–10 season, the league champion has been decided by a play-off series, in line with other rugby club competitions such as Super Rugby, Top 14, and the English Premiership: at the conclusion of the regular season, the top four placed teams enter the semi-final stage, with the winner of the first vs fourth and second vs third play-offs entering the final (known as the &quot;grand final&quot; in 2010 and 2011).

Two Italian teams – the former National Championship of Excellence team Benetton Treviso, and a new team, Aironi – joined the league starting with the 2010–11 season. Aironi was replaced by Zebre from the 2012–13 season. Through the 2012–13 season, the Welsh, Irish, Scottish and Italian rugby unions used the league as the sole determinant for Heineken Cup qualification, and from 2013–14 they use it as the sole means of qualification for the successor to the Heineken Cup, the European Rugby Champions Cup.

Two South African teams - Southern Kings and Cheetahs joined the competition in 2017 to create Pro14, while the four remaining professional franchises stayed in Super Rugby. The competition adopted a modified two-conference format rather than a full round-robin single table, with extra fixtures to maintain national derby matches. As weaker provinces, both struggled in the three years in which they took part, and were ineligible for European competition. The terminal financial difficulties at Southern Kings, and the COVID-19 pandemic effectively ended their participation in 2020, and there was no South African participation in the 2020 season, although the competition retained the Pro14 name.

Despite the difficulties, however, the competition proved attractive to the South African Rugby Football Union, due to shared time zones and reduced travelling, and the four major Super Rugby franchises - Stormers, Sharks, Bulls and Lions joined the renamed United Rugby Championship the following year, firstly through the transitional Pro14 Rainbow Cup, held in a split tournament format across Europe and South Africa, and then the United Rugby Championship, this time eligible for European competition. Ironically, Cheetahs, no longer in the URC, were invited to join the European competition as well, along with Georgian side, Black Lion. South African team, Stormers, won the first edition of URC in an all South African final, before being runner-up in the second season to Irish side, Munster.

==Corporate organisation==
The legal name of the body running the competition is &quot;PRO Rugby Championship DAC&quot;, a private company limited by shares based in Ireland. The organisation is responsible for running and operating the URC and is currently owned equally by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) may become a shareholder subject to it meeting certain conditions.

The board of Celtic Rugby DAC is made up of representatives from the IRFU, SRU, WRU, ProRugby Wales, the FIR and the South African Rugby Union. The chief executive is Martin Anayi.

In 2020 the championship received an investment from CVC Capital Partners who acquired a 28% share in the championship.

The organisation&#x27;s headquarters are at Millbank House, Sandyford, Dublin 18.

==Media coverage==
Starting in the 2010–11 season, the League was broadcast live on BBC Two Wales, BBC Two Northern Ireland, RTÉ, the Irish language channel TG4, the Scottish Gaelic channel BBC Alba, the Welsh language channel S4C. The BBC Two Wales matches were usually made available to the rest of the United Kingdom via BBC Red Button. Complete match replays were also available on the BBC iPlayer. Each broadcaster provided feeds to the others for matches in their home territory. While this meant that the league was now available free to air in the UK and Ireland, in Italy it was only available on a subscription basis in its first year.

Commencing from the 2014–15 season, Sky Sports became one of the league&#x27;s broadcast partners, broadcasting 33 live games on a Saturday and also showing both the semi-finals and the final live. Its contract concluded at the end of 2017–18 season.

Also starting in the 2014–15 season, Italy&#x27;s Nuvolari began broadcasting the games involving the two Italian clubs live on its digital free-to-view channel. Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh matches were also broadcast live on BBC Radio Scotland.

From the 2018–19 season, coverage of the tournament was taken over by Premier Sports in the UK, EirSport in Ireland, DAZN in Italy, and Supersport in South Africa.

Coverage of the tournament can be found in other territories – on beIN Sports in France, and on various Setanta Sports channels around the globe (including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South East Asia and the Middle East), as well as EuroSport.

From 2004 to 2009, the Scottish and Irish rights were owned by Setanta Sports. Setanta closed down in Scotland in 2009, but Setanta Ireland and Setanta Sports 1 remained available to Irish subscribers. In 2010, RTÉ Sport, BBC Northern Ireland, TG4, BBC Wales, BBC Alba and SKY Italia came together to buy the Celtic League broadcasting rights.

On 2 May 2013, Sky Sports announced that it had agreed a four-year deal to broadcast 33 live matches each season. This deal commenced at the start of season 2014–15, Sky have 30 exclusive matches but are only allowed to cover one set of fixtures; for instance, only one Leinster v Munster match was live on Sky with the other on TG4. Regional screening of matches continued, BBC Wales show Scrum V Live on Friday Night with S4C covering a match now on Sunday afternoons. BBC Alba also screened matches, with some also available in English on BBC Scotland, although BBC Alba did offer English language commentary via their Red Button service when the match was not shown on BBC Scotland. BBC Northern Ireland screened all Ulster matches not available on Sky Sports. RTÉ Sport dropped their coverage after the 2014 final due to budget cuts, making TG4 the only broadcasters of the competition in the Republic of Ireland. The semi-finals and finals are available to all broadcasters.

On 31 August 2017, SuperSport announced that it had acquired the rights to broadcast matches within South Africa.

On 30 April 2018, PRO14 Rugby signed a partnership with Premier Sports and FreeSports to broadcast every Pro14 game live in high definition across the UK for at least the next three years. The agreement, which came into effect for the 2018–19 season, also saw at least one match per round shown live free-to-air on FreeSports.

==Teams==
The league is based on regionalised, provincial and franchise representation of the participating nations, except for Benetton which represents the city of Treviso itself. Benetton was selected for its long history after the project of a second Italian regional team, Praetorians Roma, failed. Zebre Parma replaced an earlier franchise Aironi in Italy. South Africa and Ireland use explicitly provincial structures, the former operating on a franchise system. Both countries have long organised domestic and representative rugby on a provincial basis going back decades. Wales employs a more recent regional structure, but built on an original club foundation where regions originally represented a combination of local premiership clubs, while Scotland employs the opposite, a &#x27;two city club&#x27; system where each of the clubs maps over a previous regional team. A third Scottish regional team, Border Reivers and a fifth Welsh regional-club team Celtic Warriors, were wound down by the respective unions early in the competition&#x27;s history, while Cheetahs and Southern Kings left prior to the URC rebranding, with Cheetahs surviving to compete as an invitee team in the European Rugby Challenge Cup and Kings being wound down for insolvency.

*In 2021, Benetton Rugby won the Pro14 Rainbow Cup, a transitional &#x27;spring league&#x27; conference-based tournament that took place between the Pro14 and URC incarnations of the competition. The victory is recognised as an official URC title for the Italians, the first ever won by a team from that country, but is not recognised as part of the annual continuity of the main tournament league.

===Italian participation since 2010–11===
The Celtic League board met in November 2008 to explore the possibility of Italian participation; the chief executive of the Welsh Rugby Union, Roger Lewis, stated that the league was looking &quot;favourably&quot; on Italian participation.
Following a 19 December 2008 board meeting of the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) to discuss proposals to improve Italian rugby, FIR announced that it would submit a proposal to join the Celtic League.

FIR had two possibilities – either entering four existing Italian clubs from the National Championship of Excellence into the league; or creating two teams of Italy-qualified players exclusively for the competition.
On 18 July 2009, the FIR announced that Aironi and Praetorians Roma would compete in the Celtic League from the start of the 2010–11 season – beating bids from Benetton Treviso and Duchi Nord-Ovest. Praetorians would be based in Rome at the Stadio Flaminio, while Aironi would be based in Viadana but would play some matches in the city of Reggio Emilia.
On 2 October 2009, the FIR proposed Benetton Treviso in place of Praetorians Roma.

On 28 January 2010, the FIR declared that they had withdrawn from negotiations with the Celtic League regarding two Italian teams joining the tournament, with the main issue being a €3 million warranty asked for by the league, but by 7 February, the Italian clubs had come up with the required funding. By 8 March 2010, a deal had been finalised for Aironi and Benetton Treviso to enter the Celtic League from the 2010–11 season, with each team guaranteed a place in the Heineken Cup.

At the end of the 2011–12 season, however, Aironi were no longer available to compete in future competitions as a regional club, as, on 6 April 2012, they were refused a licence to continue on financial grounds. They were replaced by another Italian side, Zebre (now Zebre Parma).

===Former teams===

Thirty separate teams have taken part in the various versions of the Championship. Of the fourteen teams no longer involved, nine were Welsh premiership clubs, replaced by five new regions. One of those Welsh regions, two South African franchises, One Scottish region and one Italian franchise make up the rest of the historic teams. Only the four Irish provinces and the original Scottish regions have been ever present (Cardiff Rugby, Scarlets, Ospreys and Dragons have changed their names). Of the fourteen, the nine Welsh clubs and Cheetahs continue to compete in other competitions.

Notes:

* Before regionalisation, Wales was represented by nine Welsh Premiership clubs from 2001 to 2003. Following this they were replaced with five regional clubs, of which Celtic Warriors only lasted a single season.
* The Border Reivers, added in 2002, were disbanded by the Scottish Rugby Union in 2007 as part of cost-cutting measures.
* Aironi was replaced by Zebre in 2012, meaning that the number of Italian teams remained at two.
*The two South African clubs Cheetahs and Southern Kings exited the league in 2020 as a result of travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

===Other nations===
After the successful negotiations with Italy, talks were held intermittently with South Africa about the possible expansion of the Pro12. A 24-team Rainbow Cup involving 11 Celtic, 9 South African and 4 Italian teams was announced in 2005, but the idea was abandoned because of financial issues on the European end of the deal and changes in the leadership of the South African Rugby Union (SARU).

London Welsh expressed interest in 2006 in joining the Celtic League if promotion and relegation were to be removed from the English Premiership.

In February 2009, South Africa was rumoured to be negotiating entry of its current Super Rugby teams into the Celtic League, to take effect when the media contract between SANZAR and News Corporation expires after the 2010 season; these rumours were immediately denied by SA Rugby, the commercial arm of SARU. In the end, nothing came of these rumours, and the competition remained a strictly European affair.

In a 2016 interview with &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, IRFU CEO Philip Browne indicated that the Pro12 was seriously considering establishing a US franchise on the country&#x27;s Atlantic coast in the near future, seeing the recent growth of the sport in the US as an opportunity to help close some of the financial gap between Pro12 and Europe&#x27;s two major domestic leagues, the English Premiership and France&#x27;s Top 14. Browne added that Pro12 was also looking to expand further into Continental Europe by teaming with major association football clubs, some of which already have rugby sections.

In August 2016, Pro12 officials began talks with the unions of both Canada and the United States about expansion before the end of the decade, with interest in putting teams on the east coasts of both countries. In September 2016, it emerged that Vancouver and Houston may be target cities, primarily due to weather considerations, though the distance from the other teams may make that more of a challenge.

While the North American plan remains active, media attention turned in 2017 toward a new possibility of South African teams entering the competition. Following the decision of Super Rugby organiser SANZAAR to drop three teams from the competition (two from South Africa), multiple media reports indicated that the two likeliest South African sides to be axed, the Cheetahs and Southern Kings, could be added to Pro12 as early as the 2017–18 season. A later BBC report indicated that the Cheetahs and Kings would be added once their removal from Super Rugby was formally announced on 7 July, though neither Celtic Rugby Limited, the South African Rugby Union, nor the two teams would comment on the report. A week after the Cheetahs and Kings&#x27; departure from Super Rugby was confirmed, the BBC reported that Celtic Rugby Limited was expected to officially add those teams at the organisation&#x27;s next board meeting on 18 July. While no announcement came on that date, media in both South Africa and Britain reported that SARU&#x27;s chief executive was at Celtic Rugby&#x27;s headquarters in Dublin to finalise the addition of the Cheetahs and Kings, with Reuters calling the expansion &quot;the worst kept secret in rugby&quot;. The addition of the two South African teams was officially confirmed on 1 August 2017. The Southern Kings entered liquidation in September 2020 and therefore withdrew from the league.

In September 2020, the league confirmed they were looking for a replacement team for Southern Kings and possible expansion to more teams in South Africa to enter the league in 2021. Later that month, SA rugby voted that their Super Rugby sides (Lions, Stormers, Sharks, Bulls) would enter the Pro 14 to replace the liquidated Kings and the Cheetahs, who were withdrawn before the 2021 season.

==Current standings==

The most recent regular season began on 20 September 2024.

==History==
===Formative years and the Welsh-Scottish League===

Pan-Celtic tournaments were proposed throughout the early professional era, with the creation of the Heineken Cup in 1995 demonstrating that inter-domestic competitions were financially viable. From 1995 onwards, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) and Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) discussed a number of Celtic league and cup competitions, discussions were also held with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) to form a British &amp; Irish league. These discussions would eventually lead the WRU and the RFU to establish the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 2005, and all four unions to establish the British and Irish Cup in 2009.

The first material steps toward a Celtic league were taken before the 1999–2000 season, when the Scottish districts Edinburgh and Glasgow were formally invited to join the fully professional Welsh Premier Division, creating the Welsh–Scottish League. By 2001, an agreement was made with the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) to bring in the four Irish provinces. The 2001–02 season saw additional matches and a new league structure played alongside the continuing Welsh–Scottish League and the Inter-Provincial Championship in Ireland. The new format was named the Celtic League. The Celtic League had developed by 2005, and the tournament became the sole professional league in Ireland and Scotland (the Anglo-Welsh Cup and semi-pro Welsh Premiership continued in Wales) and had entirely replaced both the Welsh–Scottish League, and the Inter-Provincial Championship.

===Celtic League (2001–2011)===

====2001–02====
The first full season of a pan-Celtic competition saw 15 teams compete: the four Irish provinces (Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster), two Scottish teams (Edinburgh Reivers and Glasgow) and all nine Welsh professional teams (Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff RFC, Ebbw Vale, Llanelli, Neath, Newport, Pontypridd and Swansea).

Played alongside each country&#x27;s own domestic competitions, the teams were split into two groups (of eight and seven) and played a series of round-robin matches with each team playing the other only once. The top four teams from each group proceeded into the knock-out phase until a champion was found. Clashes between teams in the Welsh–Scottish League also counted towards the new competition.

The 2001–02 competition was dominated by the Irish teams with all four sides reaching the last eight, three progressing to the semi-finals, and the thrilling final played at Lansdowne Road contested between Leinster and Munster with Leinster running out 24–20 winners.

====2002–03====

Champions Leinster failed to make the quarter-final stage in 2003. In their absence, Munster went on to win the competition by beating Connacht 33–3 in the quarter-finals, Ulster 42–10 in the semi-finals, and Neath 37–17 in the final played in Cardiff.

The format of the Celtic League remained the same for the second season, but saw the addition of a third Scottish district, the newly re-established Scottish Borders. However, the Welsh-Scottish league structure ended permanently in 2002, allowing for the expansion of the Celtic league format in the following season.

====2003–04====

A major change in Celtic League came before the start of the 2003–04 season. The Welsh Rugby Union voted to create five new regional sides (Cardiff Blues, Celtic Warriors, Llanelli Scarlets, Neath–Swansea Ospreys and Newport Gwent Dragons). It was agreed that the Celtic League would become the sole professional league of the three countries, incorporating the four Irish, three Scottish and five new Welsh professional teams.

Reformatted into a traditional league competition (double round-robin style, all clubs play each other twice, once home, once away), which meant that a season long 22-round match program was launched, and with a new strength in depth due to the amalgamation of Welsh teams and the continuing strengthening of Irish and Scottish teams through the re-signing and retention of star players, the league has been in rugby terms a success. Also introduced for the 2003–04 season was the Celtic Cup, a straight knock-out cup competition between the 12 Celtic League teams.

However, the unfortunate timing of the league&#x27;s launch and poor organisation of a working calendar meant that first the 2003 Rugby World Cup and later the Six Nations Championship prevented many of the league&#x27;s top stars from playing in over half the games. This caused the league to struggle commercially, especially regarding the newly adopted regions in Wales where the game has always traditionally been played on a club basis, not having the regional histories of Ireland or Scotland. The season ended with the Llanelli Scarlets running out as eventual winners, four points ahead of Ulster.

====2004–05====

The Welsh Rugby Union controversially purchased and liquidated the Celtic Warriors so that the 2004–05 season saw eleven teams compete in the Celtic League. The new format took the league into what many saw as a make-or-break season, clear of massive distractions such as the Rugby World Cup. With the Welsh regions partly embedded, the signs were that the Celtic League would be a competition that could continue. It was suggested that Italian sides might join an expanded Celtic League, an idea that eventually happened in 2010.

The league format was further refined at the end of the 2003–04 season, with the participants better managing the dates of the matches so as to not interfere with the national squad set-ups and to make the league more commercially viable. The league was played until April, and then the Celtic Cup was contested among the top eight teams.

The 2004–05 season was the first season that Ireland agreed to use the Celtic League standings to determine which provinces would enter the Heineken Cup. The IRFU had previously classed Connacht as a &quot;development&quot; team and so nominated Leinster, Munster and Ulster over Connacht.
The IRFU also insisted on International squad training sessions taking precedence over Celtic League matches, with Irish provinces (especially Munster and Leinster) occasionally fielding virtual second teams for Celtic League games. Some claimed this had the effect of devaluing the competition. However, despite this approach, Munster finished second and Leinster third, with Munster winning the Celtic Cup. The Ospreys topped the league table, making it two in a row for Welsh regional sides.

====2005–06====

In 2005, there were discussions over a potential Anglo-Welsh Cup competition which some saw as undermining the Celtic League. Despite Welsh assurances that the proposed Anglo-Welsh tournament would not interfere with their commitments to either the Celtic League in its present format or an expanded &#x27;Rainbow League&#x27;, the WRU made arrangements to play games on five weekends that clashed with Celtic League fixtures. The SRU and IRFU then threatened to expel the Welsh sides from the Celtic League in June 2005. It was proposed that the competition would continue as a Scottish and Irish affair for the 2005–06 season, with the possible addition of four Italian sides and the re-admittance of Welsh sides for the 2006–07 season. However a deal was reached that allowed for the Celtic League to continue with the Anglo-Welsh cup fixtures involving Welsh clubs rescheduled.

Despite these problems, the league enjoyed its most successful season, with the record attendance at a Celtic League match being broken four times, from 12,436 at the match between the Cardiff Blues and the Newport Gwent Dragons in December to 15,327 for the match between the Cardiff Blues and Leinster at the Millennium Stadium. The total attendances for the season were up nearly 50,000 at 571,331 compared to 521,449 for the previous season.

The league went down to the last round with Ulster and Leinster both in contention. Following Leinster&#x27;s victory over Edinburgh and with Ulster losing against the Ospreys, it looked like the cup would go to Dublin but David Humphreys kicked a last-minute drop goal from 40 metres to clinch the game and the league for Ulster.

====2006–07====

In May 2006, &quot;Magners Irish Cider&quot; were named as the competition sponsors for the next five seasons, and the league was renamed as the &quot;Magners League&quot;. Although known as Bulmers Irish Cider in the Republic of Ireland, the Magners brand name was used there for the league. The sponsorship followed on from Magners&#x27; previous sponsorship deals with Edinburgh and the London Wasps.

The Scottish Rugby Union announced that the Borders territory would be disbanded from the end of the 2006–07 season. It may be revived when the Scottish Rugby Union debt decreases enough to make it financially viable along with a possible fourth Scottish territory (four professional teams being the original plan for the SRU) with Falkirk, Stirling or a London-based team being possible locations; or even the Caledonia Reds, the forgotten Scottish region. In the meantime Scotland would have only two professional teams based in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

The league&#x27;s record attendance was smashed in this season with a full house at Lansdowne Road (48,000) for Leinster v Ulster. This was the last game in the stadium prior to its demolition, and was billed as &quot;The Last Stand&quot;.

The league was won by the Ospreys on the final day of fixtures. The Blues&#x27; home win over Leinster allowed the Ospreys to top the league by a single point and take the title with an away win at Borders.

====2007–08====

Only ten teams competed in the 2007–08 season, after the Borders were disbanded at the end of the 2006–07 season. Glasgow Warriors moved their home games to Firhill. After missing out on the title on the last day for the previous two seasons, Leinster finally won the 2007–08 title with one game remaining. They had been runaway leaders for much of the season.

In April 2008 it was announced that the Celtic League was to introduce a play-off system commencing in the 2009–10 season to determine the winner, thus generating a greater climax to the season and bringing it in line with other major leagues such as the English Premiership and French Top 14.

====2008–09====

The 2008–09 season was decided quite early in the season as Munster claimed the title without playing, as they were preparing for their Heineken Cup semi-final against Leinster. The final challenge from Ospreys was snuffed out when the Dragons denied them a bonus point win on 30 April. Munster had led pretty much from the start of the season with a team largely captained by Mick O&#x27;Driscoll showing Munster&#x27;s squad depth. Munster lost only four games, three to the other Irish teams, including a double loss to Ulster. Felipe Contepomi finished as league top scorer for Leinster, the year they went on to win the Heineken Cup.

====2009–10====

The 2009–10 season was the last 10-team league as the Italian teams joined in 2010–11. The league was one of the most competitive in years with perennial wooden-spooners Connacht challenging Ulster all the way for the third Irish Heineken Cup spot. Ulster needed a superb away bonus point win at Edinburgh to seal it, ending Edinburgh&#x27;s own play-off hopes. Scarlets had a disappointing campaign as typical Welsh underdogs the Dragons had a great season, eventually finishing mid table and comfortably qualifying for the Heineken Cup. Luckily for the Scarlets, Cardiff Blues won the Amlin Cup and thereby earned Wales an extra Heineken Cup place. 2009–10 was also the first time a play-off was used to decide the champion, previously the top team at the end of the season was champion. The Scottish teams and particularly Glasgow came of age and had a fine season, finishing third in the end.

The four qualifiers for the play-offs were Leinster, Ospreys, Glasgow and Munster in that order, each country having at least one team. In the semi-finals Leinster defeated Munster at the RDS, after Ospreys overcame Glasgow in Swansea. In the 2010 Celtic League Grand Final at the RDS in Dublin the Ospreys shocked Leinster, winning the title 17–12 with their first win in Dublin in five years.

====2010–11====
The 2010–11 saw the introduction of the two Italian sides, Aironi and Benetton Treviso. In the new 12 team format, the play-offs came down to Munster hosting the Ospreys in one semi-final, and Leinster hosting Ulster in the other.

The two home sides went on to win their respective matches and the final was held in Thomond Park, home of Munster rugby, where they defeated Leinster (who had just been crowned champions of Europe a week earlier).

===The Pro12 (2011–2017)===

====2011–12====

The 2011–12 season saw a re-branding of the competition as the RaboDirect Pro12. Leinster were the runaway winners of the regular season, with a 10-point cushion over the Ospreys in second. The top four were Leinster, Ospreys, Munster and Warriors in that order.
Ospreys easily overcame Munster at home in the first semi-final in Swansea while Leinster beat the Glasgow Warriors in the RDS after giving up a strong lead. In the final, also held at the RDS, Leinster were aiming to become the first Celtic League team to complete a domestic and European double, after beating Ulster the previous week in the Heineken Cup final. After trailing for most of the game, Ospreys took a late lead through a try by Shane Williams. Dan Biggar then landed a difficult conversion to give Ospreys their fourth title by a single point, 31–30.

After two years in the competition Aironi played their final match, as their licence to compete was revoked by the FIR for financial reasons.

====2012–13====

With the demise of Aironi they were replaced with a new FIR controlled team to be based in Parma called Zebre, near the Aironi base in Viadana. The Welsh clubs chose to operate under a new self-imposed salary cap, which led to a number of departures from the Welsh teams as they strove to balance their books. Some high-profile Welsh players moved to the French Top 14, but other Pro12 teams also benefited with the likes of Casey Laulala going to Munster from Cardiff Blues, Sean Lamont to Glasgow from Scarlets, Dan Parks from Cardiff Blues to Connacht and Tommy Bowe from Ospreys back to Ulster.

Ulster topped the table in the regular season, with Leinster, Glasgow and Scarlets completing the top 4 in that order. They then went on to comfortably beat Scarlets 28–17 in Belfast, while Leinster were hard pressed by Glasgow in a tense 17–15 win for the hosts. In the final (held in the R.D.S. due to redevelopment of Ravenhill) Leinster prevailed 24–18 to win their 3rd title.

====2013–14====

Rabo Direct announced that this was to be their last season as sponsors. This, combined with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the European Cup, meant that there were concerns over the future commercial viability of the tournament. However, despite all off-field issues it was a successful season with a new high for both total attendance and for a single game (51,700 for Leinster v Munster).

In the end Leinster topped the table, having led for most of the season. Glasgow had a late surge to finish 2nd overtaking Munster and Ulster in the process. All four teams showed they were worthy contenders in the next round with Leinster needing to score a late try to beat Ulster 13–9 in Dublin while Glasgow just got past Munster in Scotstoun by one point to win 16–15. The final in the R.D.S. was also a close game for most of the match with Leinster forced to defend for long periods. However they eventually pulled clear, adding two late scores which made the final result look somewhat lopsided at 34–12.

====2014–15====

The RaboDirect title sponsor was replaced by Guinness. With the Heineken Cup being replaced by the 20-team European Rugby Champions Cup in the 2014–15 season, the Pro12 table had a greater impact on qualification. Under the previous format, the Pro12 provided a minimum of 10 teams, with Scotland and Italy providing two teams each, and Ireland and Wales both providing three. The new system saw a total of seven teams, with one place now being reserved for the highest-finishing Pro12 team from each of four participating countries and three other qualifiers based solely on league position. The other teams were entered in the new second-tier competition, the European Rugby Challenge Cup.

Leinster were the defending champions having beaten Glasgow Warriors in the previous season&#x27;s playoff final, to become the first team in the league to successfully retain the trophy. Leinster were unable to defend their title as they failed to qualify for the end-of-season playoffs for the top four teams after the regular season. Glasgow Warriors finished the regular season on top of the table, and were crowned champions for the first time, beating second seeded team Munster 31–13 in the final. Thus, the Warriors became the first Scottish team to win a professional trophy, beating Edinburgh&#x27;s appearance in the final of the 2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup.

====2015–16====

With the 2015 Rugby World Cup taking place during the opening months of the season, changes were made to the usual fixture schedule to minimise the effect on teams who released players to take part. The low number of games in the opening weeks of the season led to fixture congestion at the end of the tournament, with each team playing a game every weekend for 16 weeks straight from October 2015 to January 2016, including European matches.

As in the previous season, qualification to the European Champions Cup was guaranteed to the top team from each country participating in the league, with the three highest placed team&#x27;s not already qualified also earning a berth. Unlike in the previous season where the 20th tournament spot was decided by a play-off involving teams from the Pro12, France&#x27;s Top 14 and the English Premiership, due to fixture congestion from the World Cup, the final spot in the tournament was reserved for the winner of the 2015 European Challenge Cup if not already qualified.

The delayed start to the season, and absence of established international players during international Test and Six Nations windows, arguably gave some advantage to &#x27;lesser&#x27; teams, and Connacht, coached by Pat Lam, duly led the league for much of the season. Despite not ultimately finishing top of the league, they converted their form into a maiden championship title in the post-league play-off matches, including a home semi-final victory over reigning champions Glasgow Warriors, and the Pro12 Final against league-topping Leinster at the neutral venue of Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.

====2016–17====

Despite losing their first three matches, the Scarlets finished third in the league. They became the first team in the Pro 12&#x27;s history to win an away semi-final, beating Leinster 27–15 at the RDS Arena, before beating league-topping Munster 46–22 at the Aviva Stadium. Scarlets wing Steff Evans ended up as the league&#x27;s top try scorer with 11 tries.

===The Pro14 Championship (2017–2021)===
====2017–18====

Big changes happened this season with the addition of two South African teams and a change from a league format of home and away to a conference structure championship. The 14 teams were split into two conferences of seven teams each. They play each team in their own conference twice (12 games) and each team in the other conference once (7 games), plus two derby games against the team(s) in the other conference from their own country, making 21 matches in total. The team that finishes top in each conference qualifies directly, one for each of the semi-finals, while the teams that finish second and third in each conference qualify as the four quarter-finalists to determine the other two semi-finalists.

Leinster would regain the title at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin and would become the first Pro14 side to ever win a European and Domestic double, they did so by beating previous holders Scarlets in a high scoring affair, 40-32. The two sides had already met in the European Semi-Final only a few weeks prior to the playoff final in very similar circumstances, at the same stadium and with much of the same lineup either side. It was Leinsters fifth domestic title. 

====2018–19====

The two conference format continued this season. The top three eligible European teams in each conference automatically qualified for following year&#x27;s Champions Cup. The fourth ranked eligible team in each conference met in a play-off match with the winner taking the seventh Champions Cup place. As Leinster lost the Champions Cup final on 11 May 2019, Ospreys hosted Scarlets in the play-off on 18 May 2019. Ospreys secured the sole Wales Champions Cup place for following season by defeating Scarlets 21-10. The Pro14 final was played between Glasgow Warriors and Leinster and was played at Celtic Park in Glasgow. Leinster won the game 18–15 to retain the title.

====2019–20====

All teams played their normal schedule until round 13 after which an additional two rounds of derby matches were played by the 12 European teams. The Southern Kings announced in August 2020 that they had voluntarily withdrawn from the league for the remainder of 2020. The top four eligible European teams in both conferences automatically qualify for the 2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup. (The South African teams did not compete in the Champions Cup.) Qualification was based on league position after round 13. The grand final match was due to be held at Cardiff City Stadium, however, on 19 March 2020, Celtic Rugby DAC cancelled the event due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The re-arranged match took place on 12 September 2020 at the Aviva Stadium between defending champions Leinster and Ulster. Leinster won the match 27–5 to defend their title and complete a hat-trick of title wins.

====2020–21====

Twelve teams competed in this season — four Irish teams: Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster; two Italian teams: Benetton and Zebre; two Scottish teams: Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors; and four Welsh teams: Cardiff Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets. Neither of the two South African teams competed this season, with the Cheetahs unable to compete due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Southern Kings having entered into voluntary liquidation due to heavy financial losses.

Due to the delays experienced during the 2019–20 season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020–21 season started later than usual on 2 October 2020. Leinster won their fourth consecutive Pro14 title and 8th overall defeating Munster in the grand final on 27 March.

===Rainbow Cup===

The 2020–21 Pro14 was reduced to twelve teams as the two South African teams - the Cheetahs and Southern Kings - were not allowed to travel internationally in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, the Southern Kings ceased operations and the South African Rugby Union council began exploring the possibility of the four South African former Super Rugby teams - the Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers - joining an expanded Pro14. PRO14 Rugby announced in December 2020 that the 2020–21 Pro14 regular season would conclude after 16 rounds, and the top team from each conference would advance to a final in March 2021. The &quot;Pro14 Rainbow Cup&quot; then commenced in April and introduced the four new South African teams. The first-placed teams from each tournament, Benetton and Bulls, played in the final in Treviso. Benetton won 35–8 in front of their home crowd for a historic first win of an international competition for any Italian club.

===United Rugby Championship===
====2021–22====

The tournament consisted of 18 rounds. There were four regional pools: The Irish Shield pool (featuring the four Irish teams), the Welsh Shield pool (featuring the four Welsh teams), the South African Shield pool (featuring the four South African teams) and the Scottish/Italian &#x27;Azzurri/Blue&#x27; Shield pool (featuring the two Italian and two Scottish sides). Teams play six matches against their regional pool rivals home and away. The remaining twelve matches are made up by a single round robin, consisting of an even number of six home and six away matches against all the sides from the other pools.

The first United Rugby Championship Final was an all-South African derby, ensuring the first ever South African winner of the tournament, the Bulls having narrowly missed out on winning the transitional Pro14 Rainbow Cup competition. It also marked the first time in the history of the competition that a Grand final play-off match has not included at least one Irish province, a run of 14 finals. The Stormers defeated the Bulls 18–13 in Cape Town.

====2022–23====

The tournament consisted of 21 rounds; 18 rounds of regular season play, followed by three rounds of play-offs. The final, held on 27 May 2023, saw Munster defeat defending champions the Stormers by a score of 19–14.

==Results==

Since its inception, the competition has been dominated by Irish teams; in 23 years of the competition, Ireland has provided 14 of the champions, and 13 runners-up. The dominant team in this era has been Leinster, who have appeared in eleven out of 15 playoff finals, been both a winner and runner up in the &#x27;round-robin&#x27; era, and have won 8 league titles in total, including &#x27;four in a row&#x27; between 2017 and 2021. The two closest rivals to this dominance have been domestic and European rivals Munster with four titles and five runners-up spots, and Welsh flagship Ospreys with two titles in the round-robin era and two in the play-offs era. Ulster, Connacht, Scarlets (twice, once as Llanelli Scarlets, once as Scarlets), Glasgow Warriors and Stormers have also taken home the title. The 2021–22 tournament marked the first title won by a South African team: the Stormers. That year&#x27;s competition also featured the first grand final not to contain a single Irish team as the losing finalists, the Bulls, were also South African.

No Italian side has yet reached an ordinary league final. The best play-off performances from the nation have been two quarter-final appearances: in 2019 and 2024 for Benetton Rugby for Italy. Benetton did however emerge as champions of the Covid-affected transitional championship, the Pro14 Rainbow Cup, which was designed to introduce the former Super Rugby sides to European rugby competition. Although not treated as a championship in the ordinary lineal line, the 2021 Rainbow Cup is considered an official URC competition, along with the defunct Celtic Cup knockout tournament. As such, every country in the competition has at least once taken home league-wide silverware.

As of 2022, four Regional Shields will also be awarded annually. The inaugural winners of the Irish, Welsh, South African and Scottish-Italian URC Shields were Leinster, Ospreys, Stormers and Edinburgh respectively.

===By year===

====League====

Below are the list of champions, runners-up and table toppers each season.

====Celtic Cup====

The Celtic Cup was a short-lived single elimination knock-out competition, held alongside the Celtic League.

====Rainbow Cup====

The Pro14 Rainbow Cup was a one-off &#x27;transitional&#x27; or &#x27;Spring Season&#x27; tournament created to facilitate the integration of the four South African sides into the United Rugby Championship. ahead of the 2021–22 season. For the first time, an Italian team and a South African team reached the final of an official Celtic League/Pro Rugby competition, with Benetton Treviso winning Italy&#x27;s first-ever trophy at Pro Rugby level.

====Regional Shields====

From the 2021–2022 season, a trophy will be awarded to each team that finishes top of its regional &#x27;pool&#x27; (with Scottish and Italian teams sharing a trophy). the Irish Shield, Welsh Shield, South African Shield and Scottish-Italian Shield respectively. Prior to 2023, all matches counted, since then only matches with shield rivals are counted.


===By championship wins===

===By country===
=== By season and team : URC era ===

=== &#x27;Perfect Seasons&#x27; and League-Europe &#x27;doubles&#x27; ===
Only one team has achieved the feat of winning every match during a season of the competition, Leinster Rugby, who have achieved the &#x27;perfect season&#x27; twice; 2001-02 and 2019-20.

Leinster are also the only team from the competition to achieve a domestic and European double, winning a &#x27;minor double&#x27; with the 2012–13 Pro12 title and the 2012–13 European Challenge Cup, before claiming the &#x27;full double&#x27; of the 2017–18 Pro14 and the 2017–18 European Rugby Champions Cup.

URC clubs have won the Champions Cup on seven occasions, Leinster four times, Munster twice and Ulster once. The Challenge Cup has come back to the league four times, once with Leinster, twice with Cardiff Rugby and once with Sharks.

==Attendance==
==List of final venues==
From 2002 to 2003 and from 2010 to 2014, the higher ranked team in the final were the hosting team. Between 2003 and 2010, no play-off was held and final standings determined the champion. However, from the 2014–15 Pro12 season onward, a pre-determined stadium was chosen at the start of the season that would host the final. In 2021–22, the inaugural United Rugby Championship season, the competition reverted to the highest seeded team hosting the final.

With 5 finals, RDS Arena, the home stadium of Leinster Rugby, has hosted the final most often. Of the five participating nations, only Italy have not yet hosted a linear final, although Benetton Rugby did host the transitional Pro14 Rainbow Cup final in their stadium, Stadio Comunale di Monigo.

<doc id="846911" wikidata="Q6592674" url="?curid=846911" title="List of Oceanian Jews">
<text>The vast majority of Jews in Oceania (estimation 120,000) live in Australia, with a population of about 7,000 in New Zealand (6867, according to the 2013 NZ Census). Most are Ashkenazi Jews, with many being survivors of the Holocaust arriving during and after World War II. More recently, a significant number of Jews have arrived from South Africa, Israel, the United Kingdom and Russia. The official number of people who practised Judaism in the 2001 census was only 121,459 but this number is expected to be much higher, as it did not count those overseas (i.e. dual Australian-Israeli nationals) or many non-practicing Jews who prefer not to disclose religion in the census are more common. Since the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, Australia&#x27;s Jewish population has hovered around 0.5% of the total counted.

The vast majority of Australia&#x27;s Jews live in inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney with smaller populations, in numerical order, in Perth, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Adelaide. Currently, there are also recognised communities in Ballarat, Bendigo/Castlemaine, Canberra, Geelong, Gosford, Hobart, Launceston and Newcastle.

In Melbourne, the Jewish population centre is Caulfield where there are streets with nearly a 100% Jewish population; the main areas of settlement spread out from Caulfield in two arcs: south through St Kilda, Elwood, Elsternwick, Brighton, Moorabbin and right down to Frankston; east through Toorak, Malvern, Hawthorn, Kew, Balwyn to Doncaster. In Sydney the major areas of Jewish settlement are in the east and on the North Shore, in particular the suburbs of Bondi, Dover Heights, Rose Bay, Vaucluse, St Ives and Hunters Hill.

In New Zealand, most Jews live in Auckland and Wellington with smaller populations in Dunedin and Christchurch. Dunedin synagogue has possibly the world&#x27;s southernmost Jewish congregation.

The following is a list of prominent Oceanian Jews, arranged by country of origin.

<text>Million Wolde (Amharic: ሚሊዮን ወልዴ; born March 17, 1979) is an Ethiopian athlete and winner of the 5,000 metres race at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

At the age of seventeen, Million Wolde competed in the 1996 World Junior Championships in Sydney, finishing sixth in the 3,000 m steeplechase. At the next World Junior Championships, at Annecy, France in 1998, he won the 5,000 m. He also finished eighth in the Junior World Cross-Country Championships at Cape Town in 1996, gained second place at Turin in 1997 and at Marrakech, in 1998, he won his final junior championships over 8 km. On the road, Wolde represented Ethiopia in the 1998 World Road Relay Championships at Manaus, Brazil. Ethiopia eventually finished second to Kenya, after Wolde had established a narrow lead in the initial 5 km leg.

But the real fame came when Wolde won the bronze medal in the 3,000 metres at the World Indoor Championships at Maebashi in 1999 and then finished eighth in the 5,000 m at the World Championships in Seville later that year. At the World Cross-Country Championships, Wolde finished fourth in the senior men&#x27;s short course (4 km) at Belfast in 1999 and fifteenth at the same distance in Vilamoura, Portugal in 2000.

The highlight of Wolde&#x27;s career came in the 5,000 m at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, when he was still just twenty two. With no one prepared to set a decent pace, Wolde bided his time and then sprinted past the leaders with 200 m remaining to win in 13:35.49 ahead of second placed Ali Saïdi-Sief of Algeria and Morocco&#x27;s Brahim Lahlafi. At the next World Championships in Edmonton, Canada, Wolde won a silver medal in 5,000 m.

Injuries hampered his career during recent years, but he was still active . As of 2015, he lived in Tarrytown, NY and participated in several local races. As of August 2018, Million was an Assistant Cross Country coach at Saint Thomas Academy in Mendota Heights, MN.

<text>Artis Pabriks (born 22 March 1966) is a Latvian politician. Since January 2019 he has been the Minister for Defence and Deputy Prime Minister of Latvia. From 2014 to 2018, he was a Member of the European Parliament.

==Early life and career==
After completing his mandatory two-year stint in the Soviet Army, Pabriks obtained a degree in history from the University of Latvia in 1992 and, on a Danish-financed grant, completed his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Aarhus in 1996.

After finishing his Ph.D. on minorities in Europe, he became the rector of the Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences, a newly founded regional college located in Valmiera. He has co-authored one book: &quot;Latvia: Challenge of Change&quot; (2001), which was subsequently re-published together with volumes on Lithuania and Estonia under the title &quot;The Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania&quot; (2002). Both were published by Routledge.

==Political career==
Pabriks was one of the founding members of the People&#x27;s Party in 1998 and became a member of the Saeima in March 2004. He served as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs, 2004–2007===
Pabriks was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs on 21 July 2004. He resigned from his position in October 2007 due to disagreements with the leadership of the People&#x27;s Party, which he subsequently left.

===Return to private life 2008-2010===
In September 2008, Pabriks was one of founding members of the Society for Political Change. He was a visiting professor at Bosphorus University in Istanbul lecturing for the first semester of the 2009-2010 academic year.

===Minister of Defence, 2010–2014===

After the 2010 parliamentary election, Pabriks re-entered the government as the Minister of Defence.

In 2010 Pabriks challenged the incumbent general secretary of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Spencer Oliver for his position. Pabriks, supported by the Latvian delegation, called the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly’s rules &quot;quite shocking from the perspective of an organization that&#x27;s monitoring elections&quot;. It would have required a full consensus minus one to oust Oliver who has been in the position of general secretary since the organization’s inception in 1992. Pabriks was unsuccessful in his challenge.

In early 2014, Pabriks was Unity’s first nominee to replace incumbent Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis; however, he was rejected by President Andris Bērziņš who argued that he lacked economic credentials. Instead, the position went to Laimdota Straujuma.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2014–2018===
Pabriks was elected to the European Parliament at the European election in 2014. He has since been serving on the Committee on International Trade. In this capacity, he is the Parliament’s chief rapporteur on EU-Canada trade agreement CETA. In addition to his committee assignments, he is a member of the Parliament’s delegations to the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly and for relations with the countries of Central America.

In 2015, news media reported that Pabriks was included in a Russian blacklist of prominent people from the European Union who are not allowed to enter the country.

In 2016, Pabriks was the Parliament’s lead negotiator on a proposal to set up a new EU border force and coast guard.

===Leader of Development/For! since 2018===

In June 2018 Pabriks left the Unity party and joined the liberal movement Development/For!. He was nominated as the prime ministerial candidate of this electoral alliance and was elected member of the Saeima in the 2018 parliamentary election.

===Defence Minister (2019-2022)===
Between January 2019 and 14 December 2022 he was the Minister for Defence and Deputy Prime Minister of Latvia in the First Kariņš cabinet.

==Other activities==
* &quot;Baltic Review&quot;, Member of the Editorial Board (since 2002)

==Personal life==
Pabriks has a daughter from a previous marriage and two children from his wife Undine, an ethnic German. 

Pabriks speaks fluent Latvian, Russian, and English, as well as some German and Danish.

<text>The Herschel Museum of Astronomy at 19 New King Street, Bath, England, is a museum that was inaugurated in 1981. It is located in a town house that was formerly the home of William Herschel and his sister Caroline.

== Location ==

The museum is situated in the former home of the Herschels at 19 New King Street (south side) in Bath, England. The building is a particularly well-preserved small town house of the period. The modest town-house covers five floors, and includes two reception rooms on the ground and first floor. The town house is part of a terrace that was built around 1764-1770. The building is constructed from Bath stone ashlar, with some coursed rubble at the rear, and slate Mansard roofs with pantiling on the internal slopes. The entrance is on the left-hand side of the building, which has three storeys, as well as an attic and basement, each of which have two sash windows. The building represents a middle-grade Georgian town house, typical of the homes of artisans and tradesmen of the city of Bath (but contrasting with Bath&#x27;s grand visitor houses)

The Herschels moved into 19 New King Street in 1777, at which point the builders would have still been present, and the road would have been unmetalled. William discovered Uranus whilst residing in the house in March 1781 using a 7 foot telescope designed and built in the attached workshop. William left Bath in 1782, but Caroline, along with their brother Alexander, remained at the house until 1784.

The building has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. The building was restored in 1981, and again in 2000, using period detailed wallpaper based on fragments discovered in other Bath houses, and carpets based on 18th-century designs.

== Museum ==

In 1977 the William Herschel Society was set up to gather support for the rescue of the building. It was purchased in 1981 with the aid of Doctors Leslie and Elizabeth Hilliard, saving it from demolition. The main-belt asteroid 6395 Hilliard was later named in their honor. The house was subsequently transferred as a donation to the Herschel House Trust. The museum was opened on 13 March 1981, exactly 200 years after Herschel discovered Uranus. The museum is governed by the Herschel House Trust, a registered charity. The Bath Preservation Trust became the sole trustee of the Herschel House Trust in July 2015. The patrons of the museum have been Patrick Moore (until 2012) and Brian May (from December 2013). The museum is curated by Debbie James.

The museum offers audio tours. A virtual tour of the museum is available for mobility-impaired visitors, and a book containing tactile images is available for blind or partially sighted visitors. A disabled parking space is located outside of the building. Replica objects in the museum, including a replica of Herschel&#x27;s polishing machine, are designed to be handled. The museum uses QR codes to provide translations of the display exhibit labels in 10 different languages, and illustrated trails are available from the shop. The museum has a school programme and workshop.

== Layout and contents ==

The basement contains a kitchen, parlour and workshop. At ground floor, the building has an entrance hall with a staircase, a small closet room that is used as a dining room, and a large south-facing room at the back of the house. Similar south-facing rooms are present at each level of the building. The dining room contains Herschel&#x27;s dining table. On the first floor, the Music Room occupies the closet room, and the south-facing room is the Drawing Room. The upper floors provided bedrooms and servant quarters; they have subsequently been converted into flats.

=== Kitchen ===

The kitchen incorporates a Victorian cast iron range and a stone flag floor. It contains a replica Georgian house based on the museum&#x27;s building, which is fully furnished inside.

=== Workshop ===

William built a single-storey workshop at the rear of the basement, extending into the garden; he used the workshop to conduct experiments and to construct his lenses, and it still contains Herschel&#x27;s treadle lathe. The workshop, adjacent to the kitchen, was where William and Alexander made their telescopes. It contains a replica furnace, and a replica of William&#x27;s machine for polishing lenses, the original of which is in the Science Museum, London; the replica polishing machine has been designed to be handled, and a touchscreen computer demonstrates the tools and machinery in the workshop.

=== Caroline Lucretia Gallery ===
The Caroline Lucretia Gallery, named after Caroline Herschel, was added to the museum in 2011. The gallery was designed by Hetreed Ross Architects, and is of a modern design, with floor-to-ceiling glazing, overhanging eaves and a flat stainless steel stressed skin roof, with the solid walls constructed of Bath Stone Ashlar to match the rest of the building. Inside, two walls are the former outer walls of the kitchen and workshop, and the other two consist of display panels. The limestone slab floor is insulated and heated. It cost £80,000, which was raised via a 2-year funding campaign, after planning permission was approved in 2008. It received a prize for building and design from the Bath and North East Somerset Building Control Department.

The gallery expanded the available space at the museum, and is used for temporary exhibitions. In August–December 2013 the exhibition was on the art and science of light in the 18th century, entitled &quot;Making light of it&quot;, and in April–December 2014 it was on Caroline Herschel, entitled &quot;Being Caroline - A Second Self&quot;. In August–December 2015 the temporary exhibit was &quot;Waterloo and The March of Science&quot;.

=== Auditorium ===
The &quot;Star Vault Astronomy auditorium&quot;, opened in 2003, shows a short film about the Herschels, their life living at 19 New King Street, and modern space exploration, narrated by Patrick Moore.

=== Garden ===

The garden has been restored in the style of a formal Georgian town garden, with cypress trees and a quince arbour, as well as native medicinal and culinary plants that would have been grown in 1794.

A diameter powder-coated steel seed head by Ruth Moilliet represents Uranus&#x27;s position in the 2005 &quot;Spaced Out&quot; model of the solar system, which spanned the UK with the Sun at Jodrell Bank Observatory.

A sculpture of William and Caroline, named &quot;Star Gazers&quot; by Vivien Moudell, sits against the garden wall close to the entrance to the workshop. Made of Bath stone and slate, it was unveiled in 1988 by Patrick Moore and Rod Davies. It shows William dressed in a wig, jacket and ruffled shirt, behind Caroline, in a bonnet and holding a quill pen, looking at a piece of paper showing a drawing of the solar system with Uranus at the centre. An octagonal slate panel was set above their heads, engraved with planetary orbits.

The garden also contains a sundial at the location where William may have placed his telescope.

=== Music Room ===
The Music Room was used by William to teach pupils how to play music. It contains a single action pedal harp, commissioned by Mademoiselle Henriette Peyrot-Magenest in 1795, made by George Cousineau and son Jacques-Georges Cousineau, and purchased by the museum in 2012. The harp is carved and decorated in Rococo style with scrolling leaves, flowers and garlands, and a soundboard decorated with classical arabesques.

The music room also contains a modern sculpture of an orrery, created in 2009 and based on the 18th-century brass drum orrery held at the museum.

=== Collections ===

The museum holds a small dress worn by Caroline when she was around 50. It is made from white muslin with a blue spot and dates from the last years of the 18th century. The museum also has a Thomas Butterfield sundial, dating from c.1690, made of silver in the shape of a bird, with names of European cities and their latitudes on the back; a Copernican Armillary sphere by George Delamarche, made of brass, wood and paper, and with Herschel&#x27;s name and Uranus on one outer ring; a Cometarium showing the motion of a comet on its path around the sun, on loan from the Science Museum; and paintings of Elizabeth Baldwin by Robert Muller (pre-1798) and John Herschel (1892).

A scale model of the 40-foot telescope, as well as an early photo of it that is framed in wood from the telescope, is on display at the museum. Additionally, several rare books, including Caroline&#x27;s visitor book, can be viewed on a computer.

In 2015 it was announced that the museum will house Patrick Moore&#x27;s collection of objects related to William Herschel.

<text>Sempron has been the marketing name used by AMD for several different budget desktop CPUs, using several different technologies and CPU socket formats. The Sempron replaced the AMD Duron processor and competed against Intel&#x27;s Celeron series of processors. AMD coined the name from the Latin &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;always&quot;, to suggest the Sempron is suitable for &quot;daily use, practical, and part of everyday life&quot;. The last Semprons were launched in April 2014. The brand was retired with the launch of the AMD A-Series APUs.

== History and features ==
The first Sempron CPUs were based on the Athlon XP architecture using the &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; or &quot;Thorton&quot; core. These models were equipped with the Socket A interface, 256 KiB L2 cache and 166 MHz Front side bus (FSB 333). Thoroughbred cores natively had 256 KiB L2 cache, but Thortons had 512 KiB L2 cache, half of which was disabled and could sometimes be reactivated with a slight physical modification to the chip. Later, AMD introduced the Sempron 3000+ CPU, based on the &quot;Barton&quot; core with 512 KiB L2 cache. From a hardware and user standpoint, the Socket A Sempron CPUs were essentially identical to Athlon XP desktop CPUs with a new brand name. AMD has ceased production of all Socket A Sempron CPUs.

The second generation (&quot;Paris&quot;/&quot;Palermo&quot; core) was based on the architecture of the Socket 754 Athlon 64. Some differences from Athlon 64 processors include a reduced cache size (either 128 or 256 KiB L2), and the absence of AMD64 support in earlier models. Apart from these differences, the Socket 754 Sempron CPUs share most features with the more powerful Athlon 64, including an integrated (on-die) memory controller, the HyperTransport link, and AMD&#x27;s &quot;NX bit&quot; feature.

In the second half of 2005, AMD added 64-bit support (AMD64) to the Sempron line. Some journalists (but not AMD) often refer to this revision of chips as &quot;Sempron 64&quot; to distinguish it from the previous revision. AMD&#x27;s intent in releasing 64-bit entry-level processors was to extend the market for 64-bit processors, which at the time of Sempron 64&#x27;s first release, was a niche market.

In 2006, AMD announced the Socket AM2 and Socket S1 line of Sempron processors. These are functionally equivalent to the previous generation, except they have a dual-channel DDR2 SDRAM memory controller which replaces the single-channel DDR SDRAM version. The TDP of the standard version remains at 62 W (watts), while the new &quot;Energy Efficient Small Form Factor&quot; version has a reduced 35 W TDP. The Socket AM2 version also does not require a minimum voltage of 1.1 volts to operate, whereas all socket 754 Semprons with Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet did. In 2006, AMD was selling both Socket 754 and Socket AM2 Sempron CPUs concurrently. In the middle of 2007 AMD appears to have dropped the 754 line and is shipping AM2 and S1 Semprons.

<text>Shirley is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull, in the West Midlands, England. Historically a rural settlement within the county of Warwickshire, it is now contiguous with nearby Solihull and Birmingham.

==History==
The earliest known settlement in the Shirley area was at Berry Mound Camp at what is now Solihull Lodge, in the west of Shirley. This was the site of an Iron Age Hill Fort, which may have been the scene of a battle between the forces of King Alfred and besieged Danes (and with archaeological evidence which would indicate defense of the site during this period).

The site at Berry Mound Camp is a rare example of a univallate hillfort with evidence of a timber revetments and a re-cut V-shaped ditch which demonstrates the importance of this hillfort as a defensive site. The remains of the fortified village, protected by up to three series of earth banks, dating back to the 1st century BC, covered approximately . 

For the majority of the Medieval and Early-Modern period, Shirley was used as farmland and many field patterns remain from this period, particularly to the south of Shirley. It is probable that the majority of the Berry Mound Camp site has been in agricultural use since at least the medieval period. This has eroded many historic features. However, the remains of two banks of earth works can still be seen from the North Worcestershire Path which runs across the site and commences in Aqueduct Road, Major&#x27;s Green.

During the Early Middle Ages, the Shirley area was part of the Manor of Ulverlei, now Olton, and this remained the case until the establishment of Solihull around 1170-1180, when it became part of the parish of Solihull. It was at the end of the High Middle Ages that the name Shirley was first recorded in the early Thirteenth Century. A reference to the area from 1240, some fifty years after the founding of nearby Solihull, refers to it as &#x27;Syrley&#x27;, which means &#x27;bright clearing&#x27; in old English. 

By the Late Middle Ages, Shirley was developing into a small settlement along its main thoroughfare, called Shirley Street. The road name was first recorded in 1322 as &#x27;Schirleystret&#x27;. The use of the term Shirley Street was common by 1332. This is now the part of the Stratford Road. 

During the Early Modern Period, Shirley became a stopping-off point for travelers and many of the pubs which remain today, such as the Red Lion and Saracens Head, are situated along this section of highway. Many of these pubs trace their routes back to a wave of expansion of Shirley during the Long Nineteenth Century. Between 1725 and 1872, the Stratford Road was a turnpike road, running to Stratford from Birmingham. The frequency of travel along this route meant that inns sprang up to cater for the needs of travelers. This footfall, combined with the relatively secluded nature of the area, led to ‘sportsmen’ coming in large numbers to indulge in banned pursuits; such as bull-baiting, prize fighting and cock-fighting as well as the drinking and gambling which went alongside it.

With the advent of the Modern period in the early twentieth century, the population of Shirley was approximately 3,000 people. This marked another phase of expansion. Shirley Station was opened by the Great Western Railway on 1st June 1908. This then helped support the relocation of people to the suburbs along the route from Snow Hill railway station to Stratford upon Avon and on to Cheltenham. Along with adoption of the private motor vehicle, it was the railway that has fueled the expansion of Shirley during the twentieth century, particularly during the inter-war and immediate post-war periods.

Shirley had, by the mid-twentieth century, its own council and council house. However, with the parallel rise of Solihull, it became managed underneath the Solihull Council, becoming two district wards: Shirley and Shirley South; the council house has since been demolished. In March 1954, when Solihull became a municipal borough, H.R.H. Princess Margaret presented the borough&#x27;s charter and the ceremony was held at Shirley&#x27;s Odeon Cinema. 

The Local Government Act 1972 reformed local government in England and Wales, in response to the Redcliffe-Maud Report, creating a two-tier local government system of ‘&quot;counties&quot;’ and ‘&quot;districts&quot;’. This established the West Midlands county which came into existence in April 1974, incorporating the metropolitan borough of Solihull and thereby also Shirley.

Shirley was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The tornado later moved out over Solihull town centre.

The gateway to Shirley high street was once marked by the &#x27;Powergen’ office building; a 1960s building by Birmingham architect John Madin who also designed the former Birmingham Central Library. In 2015 it became the filming location for a zombie movie starring Glenn Close, ‘The Girl with all the Gifts, before it was demolished in 2017.

In the north of Shirley is a district known as Robin Hood. Contrary to popular local belief, this is not believed by historians to be due to a connection with the English folk hero Robin Hood, but is instead due to a misreading of the original name of the area &#x27;Robin&#x27;s Wood&#x27;. The misread name was adopted by a local public house, and eventually other landmarks in the area such as a farm, a traffic island, a golf course and the Robin Hood Cemetery, eventually becoming the official name for the area.

==Retail==

The historic and current focus for shops and businesses in Shirley is along the A34 Stratford Road. The designated high street comprises a high proportion of independent retailers and charity stores, occupying smaller retail units in predominantly inter-war period properties.

There are several pubs in central Shirley, some of which have occupied several premises on the same sites. The Saracens Head pub, dating back to 1747 as a coaching inn, was where tolls were paid to use the road from Birmingham to Stratford-upon-Avon until 1872. The Red Lion pub, at Red Lion Square, dating back to 1751, is rumoured to be haunted by a poltergeist and there are reports of local people who have witnessed objects falling off shelves. A zeppelin bomb fell in the fields behind the pub in 1917. The Plume of Feathers, which was the site of many local &#x27;sports&#x27; and instrumental in the growth of Shirley, was built in the early 1800s at the junction of Bills Lane and Stratford Road. 

A significant investment into a new retail-led mixed-use centre is under construction. The &#x27;New Heart for Shirley&#x27; was opened in May 2015. Building work on further residential properties are still continuing. Parkgate, as it is known, offers various shops, restaurants and other services such as a gym and the local library.

To the south of the high street (Stratford Road, A34), there are two retail parks; one of which is listed as &#x27;Solihull Gate Retail Park&#x27;. Cranmore Retail/Business Park is mainly DIY and tool hire. Along the A34 there are many car dealerships. There are also plans to develop a large industrial park on Blackford Road side of Dog Kennel Lane, occupying the TRW site. An application was made in 2019 to demolish the original TRW headquarters building, which was approved despite objections from the Twentieth Century Society and recognition by Council Officers that it would become an increasingly rare example of buildings of its type.

==Education==
Shirley School, which was in School Road until the 1970s, was built in 1833.

The only secondary school physically in Shirley is Light Hall School. However Tudor Grange Academy, Alderbrook School, St Peter&#x27;s School in Solihull and Langley School in Olton have catchment areas that cover parts of Shirley. Tudor Grange became an academy in 2011 and now has a Sixth Form, joining St Peter&#x27;s Sixth Form. Additionally, the Sixth Form College, Solihull and Solihull College are also major local centres for further education as well as Stratford-upon-Avon College via rail links.

Mill Lodge, Shirley Heath, Hasluck&#x27;s Green, Peterbrook, Sharman&#x27;s Cross, Woodlands, Streetsbrook, Blossomfield, Burman, Tudor Grange Primary Academy (Previously named St James&#x27;s C:E) and Our Lady of the Wayside R.C. are all local primary and infant schools that serve pupils in the Shirley area.

==Leisure==

Shirley has a public library and park, and some small patches of woodland at Bills Wood and Palmers Rough. There is also the nearby Stratford-upon-Avon Canal which provides a walking route into the Warwickshire countryside. Shirley Community Centre was opened by Princess Anne in 1985.

An annual &#x27;Donkey Derby&#x27;, a donkey-racing event, has been held in Shirley Park as a community fund-raising event annually since 1970, with the only exception being during the Covid-19 pandemic. The park itself was opened in 1927 by Dr James Coole Kneale as part of the grounds to his house, which stood next to the Saracens Head pub.

For a hundred years from the mid-19th century, Shirley had a racecourse, and this was supplemented by a public lido in Sansome Road, the Odeon Cinema on Stratford Road and the public library in Church Road, all in the 1930s.

==Religion==
The parish of Shirley was founded in 1934. There are several churches in the Shirley area, with features of local note. 

St James Church is the Church of England (CE) parish church for the town. Shirley&#x27;s reputation in the early nineteenth-century for bull baiting, cockfighting and pugilism is widely speculated to have encouraged the church authorities to start building St James Church in 1831. The church is notable for having the altar placed at the western end, which might have been a mistake but is also referenced locally as being to ensure it was kept away from the location of the disreputable activities nearby, which were centered around the nearby Plume of Feathers Pub, directly opposite the church on the other side of the Stratford Road. The church was enlarged in 1882 and in 1893 Shirley became its own ecclesiastical parish. The church grounds contain several notable graves and a war memorial which was erected in 1921. There are 23 war graves in the grounds and the war memorial is unusual in that it records the loss of an Army Matron, Katy Beaufoy, who died when the hospital ship HMHS Glenart Castle was torpedoed in 1918.

Our Lady of the Wayside is the Roman Catholic (RC) church. It opened as a mass centre in a former house known as &#x27;Heathfield&#x27; on Stratford Road, served by the Church of St Augustine in Solihull, in June 1934. The original church, built in 1937, is now the Parish Hall. In 1962, Father Patrick O&#x27;Mahony, a notable human rights activist, was appointed parish priest and immediately instigated the building of a larger church on the site of &#x27;Heathfield&#x27;. That church is now a Grade II listed building, with a then-innovative fiberglass tower, and was built between 1965-67 to designs by Brian Rush of Rush, Granelli and Partners. It includes glass by Tom Fairs and sculpture by Dame Elisabeth Frink and Walter Ritchie. It contains one of Frink&#x27;s &quot;Risen Christ&quot; sculptures as well as brick relief art by Ritchie. 

Also located along the Stratford Road (A34) are Shirley Baptist and Shirley Methodist churches.

==Transport==
There are train services to Birmingham Moor Street, Birmingham Snow Hill and on to Stourbridge Junction in one direction and to Henley-in-Arden and Stratford-upon-Avon in the other direction from Shirley railway station, which is located in Haslucks Green Road. The North Warwickshire Line from Shirley railway station currently only runs as far as Stratford upon Avon railway station; however, the line was a mainline continuing via Honeybourne railway station (which is on the Cotswold Line) as the Honeybourne Line to Cheltenham Spa.

Adjacent to Shirley station is a notable set of historic worker cottages. Immediately beside the station are eight Railway Workers Cottages which the GWR originally provided for railway workers. One of these was occupied for several years by Ted Pierrepoint, the nephew of Albert Pierrepoint, the notable twentieth century executioner. The detached house overlooking the station car park was provided as the GWR Station Master&#x27;s residence.

The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal skirts the western edge of Shirley, and it is possible to walk along this to Kings Norton away, or Stratford upon Avon, further in the other direction.

Shirley is also served by several bus routes, including the 4A, 5, 6, 49, and 76, all operated by National Express West Midlands which all stop on the Stratford Road in the town centre. Other services that operate in Shirley include the A4, A5 (operated by Landflight) and X20 (operated by Stagecoach Midlands. Solihull town centre is a 15 minute drive away.

<text>Birchfield Motor Company of Rockingham, Western Australia was a small Australian specialty car manufacturer, making replicas of the 1937 SS Jaguar model on individual orders. Birchfield is the continuation of earlier British Shapecraft that is known to have built 18 replicas.

After production from the Shapecraft factory ceased in the UK, a Shapecraft employee emigrated to Australia taking with him the Birchfield drawings and the last production car (#18) to use as a pattern. In 2004, at least two cars had been completed in Australia and two more were in production.

<doc id="846938" wikidata="Q383876" url="?curid=846938" title="Derry (Stephen King)">
<text>Derry is a fictional town in the U.S. state of Maine that has served as the setting for a number of Stephen King&#x27;s novels, novellas, and short stories, notably &quot;It&quot;. Derry first appeared in King&#x27;s 1981 short story &quot;The Bird and the Album&quot; and has reappeared as recently as his 2011 novel &quot;11/22/63&quot;.

Derry is said to be near Bangor, but King explicitly told his biographer, Tony Magistrale, that Derry is actually his portrayal of Bangor. A map on King&#x27;s official website, though, places Derry in the vicinity of the town of Etna.

King, a native of Durham, Maine, created a trinity of fictional Maine towns—Derry, Castle Rock and Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot—as central settings in more than one work.

== Overview ==
The town of Derry was first mentioned in Stephen King&#x27;s 1981 short story &quot;The Bird and the Album&quot;. While the town would be mentioned in various other stories, it was not until King&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;It&quot; when the town was used as a fully rendered setting.

Besides the oft-used trinity of Derry, Castle Rock, and Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot, King has created other fictional Maine towns, including Haven in &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;, Little Tall Island in &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; and &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;, and Chester&#x27;s Mill in &quot;Under the Dome&quot;.

In 2016, it was announced that a new adaptation of &quot;It&quot; would split the novel into a two-part motion picture. During production, the producers of the 2017 film adaptation and its 2019 sequel needed a small town in which to film, and Port Hope, Ontario, was used for much of the exterior work for both movies. Some scenes said to be in Derry were shot elsewhere. The synagogue appearing in &quot;It Chapter Two&quot; was actually the Congregation Knesseth Israel in Toronto, while the Derry High school exteriors were filmed at the Mount Mary Retreat Centre in Ancaster, Ontario. Other &quot;Chapter 2&quot; filming locations included the Scottish Rite Club in Hamilton, Ontario, Audley Park in Ajax, Ontario, and Rouge Park in Scarborough, Toronto (as The Barrens). So-called &quot;horror house&quot; exteriors were built for the movies; both were located on the same property in Oshawa, Ontario.

== Locations within Derry ==
=== The house on 29 Neibolt Street ===
On several occasions in &quot;It&quot;, &quot;the Losers Club&quot; find themselves at 29 Neibolt Street, a run-down, abandoned house near the trainyard. It is here where Eddie Kaspbrak first encounters It, which shows itself as a mix between a homeless leper and its familiar Pennywise form. Later, after Eddie tells them his story, Bill and Richie go to investigate the house and are chased off by It, the creature having taken the form of a werewolf in Richie&#x27;s mind, and Pennywise in Bill&#x27;s mind.

Soon after these incidents, the Losers Club goes back to the house in hopes of confronting It. However, soon after they confront It, the creature disappears into the sewers through a toilet pipe. They, therefore, decide to enter the sewers for their first showdown with It.

During It&#x27;s 1985 killing spree, the bodies of two children are discovered at the house. One is found across the street from the house, and the other is found underneath the porch with no legs.

In the 2017 adaptation and its sequel, 29 Neibolt Street acts as the primary entrance to It&#x27;s lair and the scene of the Losers Club&#x27;s first real confrontation with It. The house is built on the location of Derry&#x27;s old well house where 91 settlers disappeared when Derry was first settled, as well as a central hub for the town&#x27;s sewer system. At the end of the second movie, the house collapses along with It&#x27;s lair when the Losers Club kills It.

=== The Barrens ===
The Barrens are a small tract of land still heavily covered in trees and plant life. Derry&#x27;s landfill is located here, as is a gravel pit and several sewer pump stations. The Barrens play the most prominent role in &quot;It&quot;, as the Losers adopt them as their home away from home, even building an underground there. Most of the Losers have their first meeting here while trying to build a small dam in the Kenduskeag Stream, which runs through the Barrens, and next to Derry.

In &quot;It Chapter Two&quot;, after being thrown into a well, Henry Bowers is washed out of the sewer system into the Barrens by a flash flood.

In &quot;11/22/63&quot;, Jake Epping has a conversation with young Richie Tozier and Beverly Marsh from the novel &quot;It&quot; near the Barrens in September 1958, shortly after The Losers defeated It for the first time.

=== The Canal ===
A section of the Kenduskeag that runs through downtown Derry. The Canal goes through a tunnel under the streets for a short way and comes out in Bassey Park. In January 1958, a young Ben Hanscom first encounters It walking on top of the frozen surface. A few months later, Eddie Corcoran is decapitated here by It in the form of the Gill-man.

=== Derry Civic Center ===
The Derry Civic Center is a recent structure built after the old civic center was destroyed in the 1985 flood. It was designed by famed architect (and one-time Derry resident) Ben Hanscom. It plays an important role in the events of the novel &quot;Insomnia&quot;. The Crimson King, the supervillain of King&#x27;s &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series, planned to use Ed Deepneau to fly into the Civic Center on a kamikaze mission, using a small plane armed with C4 explosives. The aim of this mission was not to kill the people inside the Center but to kill a child named Patrick Danville, who plays a key role in the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; story. Following an encounter with the Crimson King himself, Ralph Roberts and Lois Chasse force Deepneau to crash the plane in the Center&#x27;s parking lot. Several people are killed, but Danville is ultimately saved.

=== Kitchener Ironworks ===
The Kitchener Ironworks was an ironworks outside of Derry. In 1906, despite every machine in the works having been shut completely down, the Ironworks inexplicably exploded, killing a group of 88 children and 102 total people who were participating in an Easter egg hunt. The tragedy was caused by It sabotaging the equipment, presumed to be responsible for eight missing bodies. This marked the beginning of the creature&#x27;s 27-year hibernation period. It is at the ruins of the Kitchener Ironworks where a young Mike Hanlon first encounters It in the form of a giant bird in 1958.

In the 2017 adaptation, Ben Hanscom first encounters It in the form of a headless child that was among the victims of the Kitchener Ironworks incident.

In &quot;11/22/63&quot;, at the Kitchener Works in October 1958, Jake Epping encounters the monstrous It from the novel &quot;It&quot;. Jake finds a pile of gnawed bones and a tiny chewed collar with a bell on it inside a fallen chimney. From deep inside a large pipe, something moved and shuffled. It whispered in Jake&#x27;s head, attempting to lure him inside.

=== The Standpipe ===
The Standpipe was a large water tower in Derry, very similar to the Thomas Hill Standpipe. In its earlier days, it remained unlocked so that patrons of an adjoining park could climb a spiral staircase around the tank to look out over Derry from the top. The Standpipe was closed to the public after several children drowned in the tank, most likely the fault of It. The Standpipe is where Stan Uris first encounters It, which takes the form of drowned children.

After the grown-up Losers Club kills It in the second Ritual Of Chüd in 1985, a huge storm ensues, destroying many buildings and landmarks in Derry, including the Standpipe. In &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, Mr. Gray drives to Derry to find the Standpipe, only to discover a memorial featuring a cast-bronze statue of two children and a plaque underneath, dedicated to the victims of the 1985 flood and of It. The plaque has been vandalized with graffiti reading &quot;PENNYWISE LIVES&quot;. In &quot;11/22/63&quot;, Jake Epping buys a pillow with a picture of the Standpipe on it. He hides a gun in it, the gun he uses to kill Frank Dunning.

=== Tracker Brothers Shipping ===
According to &quot;It&quot;, the Tracker Brothers were two men who owned a trucking depot on Kansas Street during It&#x27;s 1958 killing spree. The brothers maintained a baseball field behind the depot for children to play on. In &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, Jonesy, the Beav, Henry, and Pete first meet Duddits in the depot&#x27;s parking lot in 1978 (at which time the depot has closed), saving him from a gang of bullies. In 1985, while visiting the abandoned depot, Eddie Kaspbrak encounters Pennywise for the first time since his childhood. The depot was destroyed in the same 1985 storm that destroyed the Standpipe.

=== Voigt Field ===
In &quot;The Running Man&quot;, a Richard Bachman novella set in a dystopian future, Derry is home to a large airport consisting of acres of parking lots, a huge &quot;Northern States Terminal&quot;, several runways with the capacity to support large widebody aircraft, and a large fuel tank farm. Ben Richards, the novella&#x27;s protagonist, arrives here by car and is allowed to board a &quot;Lockheed GA/Superbird&quot; by bluffing that he has enough plastic explosive with him to blow up the entire complex.

<doc id="846939" wikidata="Q470324" url="?curid=846939" title="Saints Faith, Hope and Charity">
<text>Saints Faith, Hope, and Charity (or Love) (), are a group of Christian martyred saints who are venerated together with their mother, [[Sophia of Rome|Sophia]] (&quot;Wisdom&quot;).

Although earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology commemorated Saints Faith, Hope and Charity on 1 August and their mother Sophia on 30 September, the present text of this official but professedly incomplete catalogue of saints of the Roman Catholic Church has no feast dedicated to the three saints or their mother: the only Sophia included is an early Christian virgin martyr of Picenum in Italy, commemorated with her companion Vissia on 12 April; another early Christian martyr, Saint Faith (Fides), of Aquitania (southern France), is celebrated on 6 October, a Saint Hope (Spes), an abbot of Nursia who died in about 517, is commemorated on 23 May, and saint Charity (Caritas) is included, although saints with somewhat similar names, Carissa and Carissima, are given, respectively under 16 April and 7 September. Their feast day of August 1 was not entered in the General Roman Calendar, and they have since been removed from the Roman Martyrology.

References of the time of Gregory the Great suggest two groups of martyrs, mother and daughters, one buried on the Aurelian Way and the other on the Via Appia.
According to the &quot;Passio&quot;, Sophia was a widow of Milan who gave away her possessions and moved to Rome with her daughters. Her daughters were martyred before her and she buried them at Via Appia. She died a natural death three days later while praying at the grave of her daughters.
The oldest version of the &quot;Passio&quot; is BHL 2966. Caesar Baronius introduced the saints to the Roman Martyrology in the late 16th century.

Their tomb in a crypt beneath the church afterwards erected to Saint Pancratius was long a place of resort for pilgrims, as detailed in various documents of the seventh century, such as an Itinerarium (or guide to the holy places of Rome compiled for the use of pilgrims) still preserved at Salzburg, the list, preserved in the cathedral archives of Monza, of the oils gathered from the tombs of the martyrs and sent to Queen Theodelinda in the time of Gregory the Great, etc.

Saxer (2000) notes that early Christians from the 4th century indeed often took in baptism mystical names indicative of Christian virtues, and Sophia, Sapientia, Fides are attested as names of Christian women in Catacomb inscriptions. The veneration of the three saints named for the three theological virtues probably arose in the 6th century based on such inscriptions. Critical scholarship is unanimous in assuming that the hagiographical tradition is spurious, likely inspired by Latin inscriptions referring to the theological either to concepts of Holy Wisdom, Faith, Hope and Charity. Her veneration is first recorded in the late 6th century, her being mentioned in the inventory of holy chrisms collected on behalf of Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards.

The veneration of Sophia of Milan became indistinguishable from that of Sophia of Rome in the medieval period. Relics either of her or of Sophia of Rome were transferred to the women&#x27;s convent at Eschau in Alsace in 778 from where her cult spread to Germany. She is the patroness saint of widows. A 14th-century fresco of the saints is in St. Agnes chapel in Cologne Cathedral.

<text>Children&#x27;s Ward (retitled The Ward from 1995 to 1998) is a British children&#x27;s television drama series produced by Granada Television and broadcast on the ITV network as part of its &quot;Children&#x27;s ITV&quot; strand on weekday afternoons. It aired from 15 March 1989 until 4 May 2000. The programme was set – as the title suggests – in Ward B1, the children&#x27;s ward of the fictitious &quot;South Park Hospital&quot; (known as Sparky&#x27;s), and told the stories of the young patients and the staff present there.

Aimed at older children and teenagers, &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot; was a long-lived series for a children&#x27;s drama, starting life in 1988 as a contribution to the &quot;Dramarama&quot; anthology strand &quot;Blackbird Singing in the Dead of Night&quot;, then first broadcast as a series in 1989 and running from then until 2000.

==Production history==
The series was conceived by Granada staff writers Paul Abbott and Kay Mellor, both of whom went on to enjoy successful careers as award-winning writers of adult television drama. At the time, they were both working on the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, and had recently collaborated on a script for &quot;Dramarama&quot;.

Abbott, who had been through a troubled childhood himself, had initially wanted to set the series in a children&#x27;s care home rather than a hospital, but this was vetoed by Granada executives. During the course of its run, however, &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot; won many plaudits for covering difficult issues such as cancer, alcoholism, drug addiction and child abuse in a sensitive manner. The programme won many awards, including in 1997 a BAFTA Children&#x27;s Award for Best Drama, won by an episode in which a serial killer lures children to him via the internet and is – highly unusually for children&#x27;s television – not eventually caught.

Welsh television producer Russell T Davies was the show&#x27;s producer, and writer of several episodes, from 1992 to 1995.

The decision to end &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot; came in mid-2000, after transmission of the final series, and ironically came as the sole original cast member Rita May – who played Auxiliary Nurse Mags – said she had no plans to leave the show.

On 5 and 6 January 2013, the show was repeated as part of CITV&#x27;s Old Skool Weekend, which celebrated thirty years of the children&#x27;s strand. This was also the first time the programme was seen on the CITV Channel.

<doc id="846942" wikidata="Q695203" url="?curid=846942" title="Operation Tanne Ost">
<text>Operation Tanne Ost (&quot;Fir East&quot;) was a German operation during World War II to capture the island Suursaari (; ) in the Gulf of Finland before it could fall into Soviet hands. Suursaari was especially important because it worked as a lock in the Finnish Gulf guarding the minefields keeping the Soviet Baltic Fleet in Kronstadt.

==Background==
Finnish preparations to separately conclude the war against the Soviet Union prompted Germans to prepare for such an eventuality. Furthermore, as the situation became critical in mid-June 1944 during the initial successes of the Soviet Vyborg-Petrozavodsk Operation Germans placed the forces prepared for the operation into full readiness. German plans for both of the Tanne operations were planned alongside the Operation Birke, the German 20th Mountain Army&#x27;s evacuation and on 5 July 1944, the Tanne operations were assigned solely to the Kriegsmarine.

On 2 September 1944, Finland officially informed Germany of the coming cease-fire between Finland and the Soviet Union, which led to Hitler&#x27;s orders to confiscate all Finnish shipping and to prepare for Operation Tanne Ost. While the confiscation order was rescinded in order to facilitate the material transport related to Operation Birke, as Finnish authorities had prevented any ships from sailing from Finland to Germany, plans for capturing Gogland were kept in motion. The operation was initially planned with another operation to capture Åland (&quot;Tanne West&quot;), which was not carried out both because the units reserved for the operation were already deployed to the Eastern Front and because Sweden had warned against operations in Åland.

==Battle==
On 14 September 1944 a first wave of 1,400 men from both the Wehrmacht and the Kriegsmarine were loaded on ships in Tallinn. Before the assault the German commander tried to negotiate with the Finnish commander on Suursaari, as he had been led to believe from intelligence reports that the Finns might leave without resistance. At midnight, when a pair of Finnish VMV-class patrol boats were preparing to leave to transport a stranded German radio unit, a German minesweeper arrived at the docks on the eastern side of the island and demanded that the island surrender. When the demand was refused the Germans started to land troops which led to Finnish forces opening fire at 00:55 on 15 September 1944. German landing craft arrived at the docks forcing Finnish security force at the location to withdraw but not before torching the two trapped Finnish patrol boats (&quot;VMV 10&quot; and &quot;VMV 14&quot;).

German forces made further landings at the northern part of the island as well as at a beach south from the docks on the eastern side of the island. Finnish troops were able to contain the landings and even prevent further landing attempts on the island&#x27;s western side. Finnish Navy reacted by dispatching several motor torpedo boats (Taisto class motor torpedo boats &quot;T-3&quot;, &quot;T-5&quot;, &quot;T-6&quot; and G-5 class motor torpedo boats &quot;V-2&quot; and &quot;V-3&quot;) to Gogland which started their attacks against German ships supporting the landing effort at 0330. While several explosions were witnessed from the initial attacks made under cover of darkness the later attacks made at dawn provided no further results. Several German vessels were struck with torpedo hits, but only the motor minesweeper &quot;R-29&quot; sank, since the old torpedoes used by the Finns did not have enough yield to sink the larger minesweepers.

Finnish efforts forced German naval forces to start moving to the more protected western side of the island leaving the landing forces without effective artillery support. While the operation was underway 36 Soviet aircraft attacked the German forces destroying at least a landing craft. This made the Germans withhold the deployment of the force of three destroyers and two large torpedo boats which were being kept at readiness. Instead, German naval forces started a gradual withdrawal to Tallinn, leaving several landing craft and barges on the island when no contact with the landing force could be made. This prevented further waves of troops from landing. The operation ended in a complete failure, with the Finns capturing 1,231 German prisoners (of which 175 were wounded) in addition to 153 Germans killed in action with Finns losing 36 KIA, 67 WIA and 8 MIA.

==Consequences==
This operation marked the beginning of hostilities between German and Finnish troops, known as the Lapland War. The Finns benefitted from the operation since it showed the Soviets that the Finns were prepared to use force against the Germans. It further damaged the German efforts in northern Finland since Finns ordered all shipping, including that leased to Germans, immediately to sail for Finnish or Swedish ports.

==Finnish order of battle==
Finnish forces consisted of Coastal Artillery Regiment 12 (RTR 12). Defence was organized into four sections as follows.

Northern section, 1st Battalion (strength 340 men)

<doc id="846945" wikidata="Q517243" url="?curid=846945" title="Ralph Metcalfe">
<text>Ralph Harold Metcalfe Sr. (May 29, 1910 – October 10, 1978) was an American track and field sprinter and politician. He jointly held the world record in the 100-meter dash and placed second in that event in two Olympics, first to Eddie Tolan in 1932 at Los Angeles and then to Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany. Metcalfe won four Olympic medals and was regarded as the world&#x27;s fastest human in 1934 and 1935.

He later went into politics in the city of Chicago and served in the United States Congress for four terms in the 1970s as a Democrat from Illinois.

==Track and field career==

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Metcalfe grew up in Chicago and graduated high school from Tilden Tech in 1930.

He accepted a track scholarship to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and equaled the record of 10.3 seconds in the 100 m on a number of occasions, as well as equaling the 200 m record of 20.6 seconds. He became the first man to win the NCAA 200 m title three times consecutively.

At the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he virtually dead-heated with his rival Eddie Tolan, with the gold medal awarded to Tolan only after extended study of the photograph; both recorded a time of 10.38 seconds in the 100 meters. Metcalfe also earned a bronze medal at these games, in the 200 meters.

He competed again at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and again took silver in the 100 meters, this time behind four-time gold medalist Owens. They won gold in the 4×100 meter relay with Foy Draper and Frank Wykoff; the U.S. won by 1.1 seconds over runner-up Italy, and Germany took bronze. Fierce rivals on the track, Metcalfe and Owens became lifelong friends.

===Olympic controversies===

==== 1932 ====
Metcalfe was convinced to the end of his life that the 100 m should have been awarded as a tie between him and Eddie Tolan: &quot;I have never been convinced I was defeated. It should have been a tie&quot; Film evidence and that of observers of the race seem to support Metcalfe&#x27;s verdict. The AAU later changed their rules to have the winner being the first athlete to cross the line not merely breast the tape. It was the latter that Tolan was judged to have done first. The AAU went further and awarded the race as a tie but the International Olympic Committee has never agreed to this change. They maintain the result stands because the judges decided in line with the rules at the time that Eddie Tolan&#x27;s entire torso had passed the finish line on the ground before Metcalfe&#x27;s. In addition, even though credited with same time as Tolan, 10.3 s, a time that equaled the then world record, Metcalfe&#x27;s time was never ratified as a world record.

In the 200 m, Metcalfe was embroiled in further controversy. Observers at the time claimed the marking for his starting holes were 3–4 feet behind where they should have been. Others claimed this discrepancy was the result of an optical illusion because George Simpson in the lane outside cut his holes on the outside of his lane whilst Metcalfe used the inside of his. In any case, Metcalfe was offered a re-run but refused because he feared the United States would not be able to repeat its 1–2–3.

==== 1936 ====

In the sprint relay, Metcalfe became involved in a controversy not of his own making. Originally the United States chose for the relay the athletes who had come 4th to 7th in the trials. Two of these athletes, Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman, were replaced with Metcalfe and Jesse Owens allegedly because the former were Jewish. Metcalfe and Owens were undoubtedly the superior sprinters but they had not done the relay baton practice and the switch went against established practice.

Whilst all world attention was on Jesse Owens winning the gold in the 100m it is often ignored that Metcalfe won the silver in an equally outstanding performance.

===United States Championships===

Metcalfe was United States Champion at 100 m between 1932 and 1934 (and was 2nd in 1935–36) and at 200 m between 1932 and 1936.

In all he won 16 national titles at the AAU Championships, NCAA Championships and Final Olympic Trials.

===World records===

Metcalfe 16 times broke or equaled world record times at various distances. However, only 5 of these were ever officially ratified by the athletics governing body, the IAAF. The ratified times were:
* equaled the world record for 100 m of 10.3 s on:
** August 12, 1933 in Budapest, Hungary.
** September 15, 1934 in Nishinomiya, Japan.
** September 23, 1934 in Darien, Japan.
* equaled the world record for 200 m (straight course) of 20.6 s on August 12, 1933 in Budapest, Hungary.
* broke the world record for the 4 × 100 m relay with 39.8 s on August 9, 1936 (United States 1936 Olympics team of Jesse Owens-Metcalfe-Foy Draper-Frank Wykoff).

==Military and political career==

After earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Marquette in 1936, Metcalfe completed a master&#x27;s degree at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in 1939. Metcalfe taught political science and coached track at Xavier University in New Orleans, recruiting athletes to the university like Jimmie McDaniel and Herb Douglas. He served in the transportation corps of U.S. Army in World War II, rising to the rank of first lieutenant and awarded the Legion of Merit medal. After the war, he moved back to Chicago and later headed the state&#x27;s athletic commission.

In 1955, Metcalfe won the first of four elections as an alderman representing the South Side of Chicago. He ran for an open seat in Congress in 1970 as a Democrat and was easily elected from Illinois&#x27; first district. The seat had been filled for 28 years by William L. Dawson, who was retiring at age 84 due to poor health and then died less than a week after the 1970 election. Metcalfe was a co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) in 1971 and later was noted for breaking ranks with Chicago mayor Richard Daley after incidents of police brutality.

==Death==
While running for re-election in 1978, Metcalfe died from a heart attack at his South Side apartment on October 10, at the age of 68. He had previously had a heart attack in 1967.

==Personal life==

Metcalfe married Gertrude Eva Pemberton on June 9, 1937, at St. Peter the Apostle Catholic Church in Dallas, Texas. They divorced in Los Angeles, California in 1943. Metcalfe married Madalynne Fay Young in 1947, and they had one son, Ralph Metcalfe Jr., a blues music historian.

Metcalfe was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Alpha Sigma Nu honor society, the Knights of Peter Claver, and Corpus Christi Catholic Church in Chicago&#x27;s Bronzeville neighborhood. He had converted to Catholicism in 1932, while an undergraduate at Marquette.

== Legacy ==
A federal office building in Chicago (at 77 W. Jackson Blvd.) was named for Metcalfe upon its completion in 1991.

Metcalfe was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1975 and named a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Olympic Sports.

In 2016, the 1936 Olympic journey of the eighteen Black American athletes, including interviews with Metcalfe&#x27;s son, was documented in the film &quot;Olympic Pride, American Prejudice&quot;.

<doc id="846949" wikidata="Q7732233" url="?curid=846949" title="The English Intelligencer">
<text>The English Intelligencer was a mid-1960s little magazine devoted to poetry and letters founded and edited by poets Andrew Crozier and Peter Riley. It played a key role in the emergence of many of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival, and was conceived as providing a forum for exchange and building a sense of community among scattered British avant-garde poets who were in contact with and responding to the New American Poets, especially Charles Olson.

==History==

The &quot;English Intelligencer&quot;″s name is likely to have been influenced by the &quot;Cambridge Intelligencer&quot;, a political newspaper published from 1793 to 1803, which included works by radical poets. In 2009, Elaine Feinstein recalled that Charles Olson&#x27;s work had been a major shared influence among contributors to the &quot;Intelligencer&quot;.

The &quot;Intelligencer&quot; was circulated to a mailing list of British poets; the number of correspondents varied between 25 and 65, with a constant core of about a dozen. It was mimeographed and appeared roughly every three weeks, with the total run amounting to 36 issues between January 1966 and April 1968. It was delivered for free to its contributors. The first and second issues were edited by Cozier and Riley respectively. The magazine was produced at little cost using J. H. Prynne&#x27;s access to a Xerox machine at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Aside from the editors, the poets and writers who contributed and/or corresponded with the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; included Jim Burns, David Chaloner, Feinstein, John Hall, Lee Harwood, John James, Barry MacSweeney, Jeff Nuttall, Douglas Oliver, Tom Pickard, Prynne, Tom Raworth, John Riley, C. H. Sisson, Chris Torrance and Gael Turnbull.

Many of the poets who corresponded in the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; met face-to-face for the first time at the Sparty Lea Festival at MacSweeney&#x27;s home in 1967.

Throughout the publication&#x27;s history, participants disagreed over its orientation toward questions of land and nation. In December 1966, amid disputes over the value of the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; and its future, Prynne wrote that he had lost trust in the project&#x27;s &quot;shared language&quot;. The following month, Riley wrote to reaffirm the necessity of communication and communality. In May 1967, MacSweeney submitted a letter criticising what he perceived as the journal&#x27;s hermeticism and undue emphasis on Olson&#x27;s influence. The journal dissolved in acrimonious circumstances in 1968.

==Influence==

Daniel Eltringham argues that the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; influenced later modernist landscape poetry in the United Kingdom by drawing attention to histories of commons and enclosure. Eltringham also suggests, however, that the publication&#x27;s small circulation limited its political efficacy, and notes that its mailing list included only four women.

<text>Castle Bromwich () is a large suburban village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull in the West Midlands, England. It borders the rest of the borough to the south east, Sutton Coldfield to the east and north east, Shard End to the south west, Castle Vale, Erdington and Minworth to the north and Hodge Hill to the west. 

It had a population of 11,857 according to the 2001 census, falling to 11,217 at the 2011 census. The population has remained quite stable since then; the 2017 population estimate was 12,309. It was a civil parish within the Meriden Rural District of Warwickshire until the Local Government Act 1972 came into force in 1974, when it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull.

In 1861, the population was 613. This rose to just over 1,000 in the 1920s, when half of the original parish was ceded to the City of Birmingham for the construction of overspill estates. This caused a drop to 678 (almost the 1861 level). Post Second World War estate building in Castle Bromwich increased the population to 4,356 in 1951, 9,205 in 1961 and 15,941 in 1971. The parish was then split into two, resulting in the lower 2001 figures.

==History==
Castle Bromwich was originally a Warwickshire village. There has been a settlement here since before Stone Age times. There is evidence that the area was first settled some 5,000 years ago. Romans, Saxons and Normans have also settled on this raised piece of land close to a natural ford across the River Tame. The Chester Road which runs through the village follows the line of a drovers&#x27; road called the Welsh Road, whose origins probably lie as an ancient trackway from the pre-Roman era. Bromwich is not named in the Domesday Book in 1086 yet was located within the ancient hundred of Coleshill. Bromwich comes from the old words &#x27;brom&#x27; for the yellow flowering broom which grows here and &#x27;wich&#x27; an ancient name for a dwelling or settlement. The motte (called the Pimple Hill locally) is some 40 metres in diameter and appears to be a natural feature that was probably heightened by Iron Age settlers, then by the later Normans and once again during the developed of the 1970s to make way for the A452 &quot;Collector Road&quot;, which by-passed Castle Bromwich to the north.

The &quot;Pimple&quot; commanded the important crossing place of the River Tame. It still remains today, somewhat reduced, sandwiched between the M6 and the Collector Road (Castle Bromwich &amp; Chelmsley Wood bypass). There was an extensive archaeological dig of the area prior to the development of the Pimple site, and discoveries were made that confirmed folk tales of the area. The Pimple was the highest point of an iron-age fortification that encompassed most of Castle Bromwich. The land between the Pimple and Kyters Lane was particularly well defended by several ridge and furrow workings; indeed, Kyters Lane and Rectory Lane were built within ditches. Other ditches were excavated between Kyters Lane and the Pimple but nothing of consequence was found. The name &quot;Pimple&quot; was commonly used from about the year 1915 onwards, and the story that the hill was a Saxon burial ground appeared around 1935, when the spread of dwellings from Washwood Heath began to appear over Hodge Hill. Modern houses now occupy the site and overlook the graveyard. The ridge and furrows have been obliterated.

There is a good view over Castle Vale (formerly Castle Bromwich Aerodrome) and the Tame valley from the top of the hill.

During the 18th century Castle Bromwich was an important place at the junction of two turnpike roads. Chester Road, an old Roman way which ran from London to Chester, joined the Birmingham to Coleshill road near Castle Bromwich Hall. There was a toll gate at the junction of Chester Road, School Lane and Old Croft Lane, near the village green. The toll house still exists, although the massive wide toll gate has been lost. In the 1780s stagecoaches travelling from Holyhead to London stopped in the village, as did a horse-drawn bus from Birmingham to Coleshill. There were several coaching inns and two survive today. The Midland Railway arrived in 1842 and Castle Bromwich Station was rebuilt in 1901. Boy Scouts used to arrive here and trek the four miles (6 km) to their major camp at Yorkswood in Kingshurst. The station closed in 1965 and was part-demolished in 1975.

Until 1894, the village was a hamlet in the large parish of Aston. Castle Bromwich has had historic ties with both Erdington and Water Orton through administration, governance and land ownership whilst being part of the Parish. The Local Government Act 1894 created a parish of Castle Bromwich from part of the Aston parish not in either Birmingham or Aston Manor urban district. It was part of the Castle Bromwich Rural District from 1894 until 1912, when it became part of the Meriden Rural District.

During the 18th, and especially during the 19th centuries wealthy Birmingham businessmen built large houses in Castle Bromwich.

Castle Bromwich has a village green. The land for this, called Seven Acre Green, was given to the village by Viscount Newport in 1895. The War Memorial was erected in 1920 on a small island nearby. There is also another green called Whateley Green. Whateley is derived from the Anglo-Saxon for wheatfield clearing. This was the site of the village&#x27;s stray animal pounds and a smithy. It had two pounds, stocks and a whipping post. Whateley Hall was nearby. The ancient duck pond was filled in during the late 1950s.

In 1931, a portion of Castle Bromwich land was sold and ceded to the City of Birmingham who built the overspill Chipperfield Road development during 1937–8. This halved the area of the parish of Castle Bromwich, from to .

During World War II, the occupants of Chipperfield Road pulled down an ancient white-washed farm house thinking it would deny German bomber crews a marker to the aerodrome and the adjoining factories. The Firs Estate (as it was then known, and including Chipperfield Road, Oakdale Road, Millington Road and Ermington Crescent) were private semi-detached houses that briefly enjoyed the benefit of the farmland and golf links. In the late 1950s further development took place. The new council housing was built adjacent to Chipperfield Road and as far as the Newport Road. The name &quot;Firs Estate&quot; now points to the council estate and the name originated from the fir trees that stood near a large house between Chipperfield Road and Hodge Hill Common.

The council housing was also extended up what was known locally as &quot;The Golf Links&quot; to meet the Stables, now known as the Comet.

Castle Bromwich Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in the 1890s. The club and course closed at the onset of World War II.

==Churches==
There are two from the Church of England, and a Methodist and a Baptist nearby. St Mary and St Margaret&#x27;s Parish Church is the original church and is in the west of the village. It is unusual as it is a &quot;church within a church&quot;. A small stone chapel was known on the site before 1165. It was replaced in the 15th century by a large half-timbered structure. The church was extensively altered between 1726 and 1731 by Sir John Bridgeman and the old timber one was encased in brick and plaster. The massive oak timbers can be seen now in the roof. It is considered to have outstanding architectural and historic merit.

St Clement&#x27;s Church is in the east and was built in 1967, when the original parish was split into two.

==Castle Bromwich Hall==

Castle Bromwich Hall is a Jacobean mansion that was built in 1599 by Sir Edward Devereux, the first MP for Tamworth in Staffordshire. It was a single storey with a plain entrance. It was bought by Sir Orlando Bridgeman (keeper of The Great Seal) in 1657, for his son Sir John Bridgeman I. Sir John extended and improved the property in 1672, adding the second floor and a large front porch. His son, Sir John Bridgeman II, inherited it in 1710. He extended the Hall and rebuilt it in local hand-made bricks of clay. The Bridgmans were created Barons of Bradford in 1792, and Earls of Bradford in 1851. A marriage also brought Weston Park into their possession, which the family gave to the National Trust in 1986. The Hall was then rented out or used for other family members to live in. It is famous for having twelve windows (one for each Apostle) and four dormers above (one for each Of the four Gospels).

The garden door passed through a grapevine which was always trimmed into the form of a cross. The last family member, Lady Ida Bridgeman, Dowager Countess Bradford left the Hall in 1936. It then was used for storage during World War II. Post-war it was leased out as an apprentice training centre for the GEC, and then used as offices while the outbuildings are used by other small companies. The conservation area is centred on the Hall. The Hall is falsely reported as having tunnels linking to the former vicarage and former public house nearby.

===Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens===
Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens which surround the Hall is the only surviving example of an 18th-century English formal garden, having escaped the attentions of Capability Brown. Sir John Bridgeman II originally laid out the Hall&#x27;s gardens in the style to which they have now been restored by the Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens Trust. They commenced the restoration of the in 1985. The Gardens are open to the public and are a tourist attraction.

The Rectory
The Rectory Castle Bromwich was commissioned by the owner of the Castle Bromwich Hall The 5th Earl of Bradford. The 5th Earl of Bradford enjoyed having tea at the Rectory. The Recrory is now Grade II Listed.

== Other places of interest==
Many of the old buildings have now been demolished and farms have disappeared to make way for new housing and roads.

Park Hall was bought by Henry de Ardern in 1373. The &#x27;Park Hall Manor House&#x27; was supposedly haunted and was demolished in the early 1970s during construction of the M6 motorway. The hall was first mentioned in 1265, but this could have been a nearby moated timbered dwelling. Remnants of the hall, farm house and adjacent buildings, orchard and pond are still visible at the &#x27;Park Hall Wildlife Reserve managed by the Birmingham &amp; Black Country Wildlife Trust.&#x27; The name lives on in &#x27;Park Hall School&#x27;, which is on the other side of the road, and is the largest secondary school in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull.

&#x27;Castle Bromwich Post Office&#x27; was the first to have a telephone outside London so that Benjamin Disraeli could keep in touch with the government. He frequently visited Castle Bromwich Hall in the 1870s, possibly to court Lady Chesterfield and Lady Bradford. Later, Queen Mary made use of the telephone when visiting Lady Ida (Lady of the Queen&#x27;s Bed Chamber) at the Hall. The Post Office closed in 2004 and is now a hairdressing salon.

A drawing of 1726 shows a large structure called the &#x27;Old Castle Hall&#x27; next to the old castle earthworks.

Chester Road used to climb up a steep hill from the river to the church, called &#x27;Mill Hill&#x27;. Towards the bottom of the hill was a brick structure surrounding the &#x27;Holy Well of St Lawrence&#x27;. This has now been covered by the roundabout for junction 5 of the M6.

&#x27;Castle Bromwich Mill&#x27; stood on the southern bank of the River Tame, close to the bottom of &#x27;Mill Hill&#x27;. It was still grinding corn in 1895 and possibly later. It then became an artist&#x27;s studio until it was demolished in 1956. The M6 now covers the site, which is near to &#x27;The Firs&#x27; estate. There were several other mills in the area, some also drawing water from the Tame.

Two of the old coaching inns still exist. &#x27;The Bradford Arms&#x27; was built in 1723 on the site of an earlier pub called &#x27;The White Lion&#x27;. The high doors to the coach houses can still be seen. Law courts and Catholic services have been held here. It is the oldest pub in the village. &#x27;The Coach and Horses&#x27; dated from the 18th century and stood in the front drive of the present public house. This was built in the 1920s and re-roofed in 1938 when the thatched roof caught fire. Additionally, &#x27;The Castle&#x27; dates to the early 18th century and was the village alehouse. Later it became a general stores and then a private residence. The 17th century Georgian style &#x27;The Bridgeman Arms Inn&#x27; is now also a private residence.

Adjacent to &#x27;The Bridgeman Arms Inn&#x27; were several cottages, used for servants, and an estate office for the Earl of Bradford who then owned much of the land in Castle Bromwich. The first Police Station was also established here under Pc Charlie Whale, before moving to a specialist house and lock up near to the Coach and Horses. When the Kingshurst estate was built policing was from a two-man unit there, this closed down when the new Chelmsley Wood station opened. Part of the Inn was destroyed by a bomb in World War II, when two platoons of the Home Guard were based there. A 17th-century well was found in the courtyard of the cottages. The cottages and office have now been replaced by a service road and new houses.

St Mary and St Margaret&#x27;s Church of England Primary School – was built in the 19th century and demolished in 1968 when the move was complete to larger premises with playing fields. Private housing now covers the site.

Harvey&#x27;s Drapery Shop – was a single storey extension to the main house. Originally it was a druggist&#x27;s (the only one between Birmingham and Coleshill). The visiting doctor from Coleshill arrived on horseback to take his surgery in a room in the house. Later it became a two-storey extension to the house and the extended house was the home of the village electrician. It is now a private residence.

The village smithy was amongst the old cottages on the southern edge of the village green. A disused car sales site which was on the southern edge of The Green, that was being used as a drive through car wash, was demolished in September 2011 and 14 homes are currently being built on the site. The Show Home is to be opened on 14 January 2012.

Green Lane was the oldest trackway through the village. One of the ancient Ridgeways of England, it ran from the castle to Grimstock Hill Romano-British settlement at Coleshill. It is now mostly underneath Chelmsley Wood and the M6.

The following houses have all disappeared; some are remembered on road signs:
*‘Camden House&#x27; – dated to the 17th century and was a gardeners’ cottage for the Hall.
*‘The Cedars&#x27; – was built in 1897 by Alderman Thomas Clayton JP. It was a large country residence with its own generating plant.
*‘Eldon House&#x27; – dated from the middle of the 18th century and used as a farm and the rectory.
*‘The Elms&#x27;
*‘The Firs&#x27; – was a large house near Castle Bromwich Hall. It was usually occupied by the estate bailiff to the Hall. The site is now a post World War II housing estate of the same name.
*&#x27;The Gables&#x27; – dating from 1800, but it was a mock half timbered 16th-century manor house.
*&#x27;The Granary&#x27; – dated to the early 18th century was the village malt house. It is now a private residence. The upstairs room was once used for Church meetings and the adjoining building was an early bowling alley. This adjoining building has been demolished and a private house erected upon the site.
*&#x27;Hawkesford&#x27;
*&#x27;The Hawthorns&#x27;
*&#x27;The Hollies&#x27;
*&#x27;Rainbow Cottages&#x27; – a group of cottages opposite the Post Office.
*&#x27;The Southfields&#x27; – dated to the middle of the 19th century. In 1908, it was occupied by Edward Randall who owned the first motor car in the village. During the Second World War, it became a secret plastics factory. The house is now part of the Remembrance Club.
*&#x27;The Sycamores&#x27; – later known as Poplar Farm
*&#x27;Timberley House&#x27; – was built in the late 18th century as a farmhouse. It was demolished in the 1930s and a cinema was built on the site. Before fitting out it was used a store in the Second World War. This was demolished in 1962 and a small supermarket now exists there.
*&#x27;Westeria&#x27;
*&#x27;Whateley Hall&#x27; – probably built in the 18th century in classical style, but there is evidence of a moated structure from the 14th century. The Hall was surrounded by considerable wooded grounds and was the second largest house in the village, after Castle Bromwich Hall. The Knight family was in residence from the 1860s until 1935 when it was sold and demolished. The Hall was owned by the William Newton II before this, and his sons Canon Horace Newton and Goodwin Newton, before they moved to Barrells Hall.

and farms such as:
*&#x27;Beechcroft&#x27; – now a housing estate.
*&#x27;The Firs&#x27; – now a housing estate within the City of Birmingham.
*&#x27;Green Lanes&#x27; – now part of a Chelmsley Wood housing area.
*&#x27;Hob&#x27;
*&#x27;Park Hall&#x27; – remains still visible on the Park Hall Wildlife Reserve
*&#x27;Poplar&#x27; – now a small housing estate.
*&#x27;Rawlins&#x27; – only the farm house remains as a modernised &quot;half timbered&quot; private residence, the rest is a housing estate.

==Castle Bromwich Aerodrome==
A large piece of Warwickshire grassland (Castle Bromwich Playing Fields) became the Castle Bromwich private aerodrome, when Alfred P. Maxwell flew the first aeroplane in the Birmingham area in September 1909. It became a stopping place during early air races. The War Office requisitioned it for use by the Royal Flying Corps and flying schools in 1914, when proper roads and buildings were established. The British Industries Fair (the pre runner to the National Exhibition Centre) was a large complex of buildings built on land adjacent to the aerodrome and Castle Bromwich railway station in 1920. In the inter war years the aerodrome had a military and civilian function. In these early days it was the busiest airport in the area due to its combined passenger, post and railway air business. During the late 1920s and early 1930s the aerodrome was also a checking-in point for the infamous &#x27;Contact Races&#x27; held in the Midlands, which were organised by and between various civil flying clubs in the area.

In 1934, the Air Ministry stated that Castle Bromwich could not be used for civil purposes indefinitely, so a new airport was constructed at Elmdon (some five miles (8 km) away), just outside the Birmingham City boundary. It opened in 1939 and is now Birmingham Airport. In 1937, more hangars and a Squadron Headquarters were built for the Royal Air Force. In 1939, it was extended further to become a fighter station and a base for other units. It was visited by Winston Churchill during World War II.

In 1936, the Air Ministry had purchased a parcel of land opposite the Castle Bromwich Aerodrome. On this site they built the Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory (CBAF). This huge &#x27;shadow factory&#x27; was part of a larger plan to disperse production and move vital resources that lay within easy range of German bombers (Vickers Supermarine&#x27;s original factory at Southampton was devastated by enemy bombers just as Castle Bromwich came into production in 1940.). The CBAF factory was first managed by the Nuffield Organization to manufacture Spitfires and (later) Lancaster bomber aircraft. The theory was that the local skills and production techniques used in the manufacture of motor vehicles could be transferred to aircraft production. However production proved impossible without help from the professionals from Vickers-Supermarine. The CBAF went on to become the largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939–45 conflict.

Aircraft and sub-assemblies were taken across the Chester Road to the airfield, Castle Bromwich Aerodrome though early plans included an aerial bridge from E block to the airfield. Very large hangar-like buildings were erected on the east side of the airfield which were referred to as &#x27;Erecting Sheds&#x27;, where aircraft were prepared for flight testing. This was the largest Spitfire factory in the UK, building over half of the approximately 20,000 built. After failing to get initial production underway, the mercurial Air Minister, Lord Beaverbrook, ordered the Nuffield Organization to relinquish control of the CBAF to Vickers. From May 1940, the CBAF&#x27;s most productive years were overseen by Vickers Armstrong (Vickers having purchased Supermarine in 1936).

The CBAF&#x27;s chief test pilot was Alex Henshaw MBE, who managed a team of pilots who had the job of testing the aircraft. The ATA (Air Transport Auxiliary) were responsible for dispersing tested machines to the M.U.&#x27;s (Maintenance Units) around the country. As any build-up of machines on the airfield would be vulnerable to aerial attack, testing was carried out in any weather.

After the war, the CBAF became a car body factory. It is now the Castle Bromwich Assembly plant of Jaguar Cars. Its first post war owners were Fisher and Ludlow (themselves having been bombed out of their inner city factory). This company was the sub-contractor for most of the now defunct BMC and British Leyland marques, the last being Jaguar, who took over outright control of the factory in 1977. Various units used the airfield post war and there was an annual display to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Civilian flights returned, including the first scheduled helicopter service from London. Such activities were to prove short-lived.

The airfield closed in 1958 and in 1960 the site and that of the British Industries Fair, and nearby farmland was sold for housing. The runway was broken up, many of the buildings were demolished and in 1963 construction work began on a new Birmingham overspill estate – Castle Vale – which was completed in 1969. The erecting sheds survived as storage units until 2004. All that remains now is a memorial, a stained glass window in the estate&#x27;s church, streets and housing blocks with aviation names, a row of ex-RAF houses along the Chester Road, and a new Spitfire Memorial. This is a large steel sculpture called &quot;Sentinel&quot; designed by Tim Tolkien which was erected on the roundabout where the road to the estate joins the Chester Road in 2000. This was inaugurated by the CBAF&#x27;s wartime Chief Test Pilot, Alex Henshaw.

The roundabout was subsequently renamed &quot;Spitfire Island&quot;. Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the CBAF were held on 15 July 1998, which included a fly-by flown by Ray Hanna in his ex-CBAF Spitfire MkIX, MH434. Amongst the dignitaries attending was Dr. Gordon Mitchell, son of the Spitfire&#x27;s designer, R.J. Mitchell. Alex Henshaw also unveiled a memorial plaque just inside the old factory&#x27;s main gate onto the Kingsbury Road. Its principal inscription reads; &#x27;Here, swords of freedom were forged&#x27;.

==Modern Castle Bromwich==
Castle Bromwich retains some of its village character and it is very active. There is a well used multi-function village hall called Arden Hall. The office of Castle Bromwich Parish Council is situated there, as is the local police office of the West Midlands Police. Castle Bromwich has its own dedicated Neighbourhood Policing Team consisting of a sergeant, four police constables and a community support officer.
The playing fields, adjacent to Arden Hall, have a sports centre which supports cricket, football, golf and tennis clubs and is now home to Bromford Lions Football Club. There are three primary schools, one special school and one secondary school (Park Hall Academy). There are two main shopping areas, several smaller ones and numerous small businesses.

Public transport is provided in the form of bus routes by National Express West Midlands, connecting Castle Bromwich with Birmingham, Sutton Coldfield, Solihull and Birmingham Airport.

The Castle Bromwich Assembly factory owned by Jaguar Land Rover, employs 2,500 people (or 2,700 according to other sources) in Jaguar automobile manufacturing. News reports in early July 2019 indicated that the company planned to build an electric version of the Jaguar XJ saloon, replacing the manufacturing of the conventional XJ at this plant, after investing billions of pounds in upgrades to the facility by autumn 2019. A BBC report indicated that the plant &quot;also produces the Jaguar XF, XE and F-Type&quot;, but the XJ was critical to the success of the facility. Without the new plan, the Castle Bromwich plant would &quot;effectively be dead&quot;, according to David Bailey (economist), a professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School.

==Notable people==
* John Jones Bateman (1817–1903), architect, lived at Hawkesford House (since demolished and replaced by an apartment block of the same name)
*Tom Clarke, lead singer of UK indie band The Enemy used to live in Wasperton Close in the village.
*Tushar Makwana radio DJ, lived and was murdered in Wasperton Close in Castle Bromwich.
*Sir (Edwin) Cooper Perry Vice-Chancellor, University of London (1917–1919)
*Roger Taylor drummer of Duran Duran, used to live in Hawthorne Road where he taught himself to play drums Trevor Francis used to live a few doors away when Roger was a child. Roger formed his first band with schoolmates whilst at Park Hall.
*Barry Austin (1968-2021), widely reputed to be the heaviest man in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="846960" wikidata="Q344239" url="?curid=846960" title="Active Template Library">
<text>The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of template-based C++ classes developed by Microsoft, intended to simplify the programming of Component Object Model (COM) objects. The COM support in Microsoft Visual C++ allows developers to create a variety of COM objects, OLE Automation servers, and ActiveX controls. ATL includes an object wizard that sets up primary structure of the objects quickly with a minimum of hand coding. On the COM client side ATL provides smart pointers that deal with COM reference counting. The library makes heavy use of the curiously recurring template pattern.

== History ==
COM objects can also be created with Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), but this leads to larger binaries that require support DLLs. ATL, on the other hand, is a more lightweight alternative in situations where the graphical user interface parts of MFC are not required.

Older versions of ATL (ATL prior to version 7.1, pre-Visual Studio 2005) are incompatible with DEP because it places executable thunks in data heap. 
This problem can be mitigated with DEP-ATL thunk emulation with performance penalty.

In ATL version 7 (Visual Studio 2003), which directly succeeded version 3 (Visual Studio 6.0), a number of MFC classes like CString were made available in ATL, or more precisely moved to an ATLMFC common layer which is shared by both libraries. ATL version 7 also introduced attributes in C++ in an attempt to provide something similar to CLI attributes, however these have not been particularly successful, and have been deemphasized in ATL version 8 (Visual Studio 2005); the various wizards no longer generate them by default. Version 7 also introduced new string conversion classes.

On July 28, 2009, Microsoft released a patch to ATL to fix a bug that could allow ActiveX controls created using ATL to be vulnerable to a remote code execution security flaw.

Since Visual Studio 2013 (ATL version 12), all ATL code is static, eliminating the DLL.

ATL version is defined by ATL_VER macros and can be queried via AtlGetVersion() function.

== Support classes ==
ATL includes many RAII classes to simplify management of COM types. The most commonly used classes include:

* codice_1 general-purpose smart-pointer,
* codice_2 BSTR wrapper,
* codice_3 VARIANT wrapper, and
* codice_4 SAFEARRAY wrapper.

== Compiler COM support ==
Although not formally part of ATL, Microsoft Visual C++ also includes additional C++ RAII classes to simplify management of COM types. These &quot;compiler COM support&quot; classes can be used as replacement for or in combination with ATL, and includes:

* codice_5 smart-pointer that decorates the COM interface name with a &quot;Ptr&quot; suffix,
* codice_6 BSTR wrapper,
* codice_7 VARIANT wrapper, and
* codice_8 HRESULT wrapper.
Note that as of Visual Studio 2012, the compiler COM support classes does not include a SAFEARRAY wrapper.

<doc id="846963" wikidata="Q1093535" url="?curid=846963" title="Citroën Ami">
<text>The Citroën Ami is a four-door, front-wheel drive economy (B-segment) family car, manufactured and marketed by Citroën from 1961 to 1978.

The Ami was offered in saloon and estate/wagon/break body styles over two generations, the Ami 6 and the Ami 8. The later Ami 8 fastback saloon featured a steeply raked rear window, in contrast to the earlier reverse-raked rear window of the Ami 6 notchback.

Over 1,840,396 units were manufactured over the entire production run. The Ami and Citroën Dyane were replaced by the Citroën Visa and Citroën Axel.

==Name==
Ami is the French word for friend. With its 602 cc engine capacity fractionally above the limit for 2 CV designation, the Ami was nicknamed the 3CV, differentiating it from the long established Citroën 2CV.

3CV stands for &quot;Trois chevaux&quot;, or &quot;three horses&quot; — CV originally being the initials for &quot;chevaux-vapeur&quot; (horsepower – literally &#x27;steam horses&#x27;), but used here for &quot;chevaux fiscaux&quot;. The &quot;cheval fiscal&quot; was a French fiscal unit based on engine size with the smaller CV designating economy cars.

==Overview==
The Citroën Ami had its formal French launch on 25 April 1961, four months ahead of the August introduction of the widely anticipated Renault 4. Both the Renault 4 and the Citroën Ami responded to a perceived market need for a vehicle slightly larger and less rustic than the 2CV. The Ami is a rebodied 2CV with certain mechanical upgrades (particularly a larger engine than the 1950s 2CV), to compensate for the added weight. At launch all the cars were powered by an air cooled 602 cc two-cylinder flat engine which would also be offered at extra cost in the 2CV from 1970.

The platform chassis and suspension is similar to the 2CV, being independent all round using leading and trailing arms and coil springs interconnected front to rear. For a detailed suspension description see Citroën 2CV.

The Ami&#x27;s seats were easily removable. Sales pitches of the Ami included photographs of the seats being used as picnic chairs.

==Technical innovation==
The Ami and the Ford Taunus P3 were the first cars with rectangular or lozenge-shaped (non-round) headlights. This technical innovation was developed by lighting manufacturers Hella (Taunus) and Cibie (Ami). Soon this innovation found its way to the exclusive coach built Maserati 5000 GT.

==Initial sales==


The car went on sale in France in April 1961, though Citroën implemented some simple upgrades in time for the Paris Motor Show only six months later. The most visible change involved the replacement of the fixed windows on the rear doors with two-part horizontal sliding windows, similar to those already fitted on the front doors. Sales initially were not as good as those of the older 2CV; the Ami&#x27;s first full year of production was 1962, during which only 85,358 of the cars were sold, while the thirteen-year-old 2CV managed 144,759 sales during the same period. Although the Ami had a modern body, it shared the aggressively minimalist underpinnings of the older car, and this made it hard to justify a starting price for the Ami which, at the end of 1961, was 35% higher.

==Versions==
The 1961 Ami 6 sedan is distinguished by an unusual reverse-raked notchback rear window, similar in style to the 1959 Ford Anglia 105E in Great Britain. A similar design feature was used on the first generation three-door Citroën C4. This design feature first appeared on the US 1953 Packard Balboa-X show car. It was first put into production on the 1957 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser and 1958-1960 Lincoln Continentals. In the American cars the rear window could be opened as an aid to ventilation before air conditioning became standardised, and in the American fashion was given a name, the &quot;Breezeway Window&quot;.

The later Ami 8 saloon has a fastback rear window. It was redesigned by the French car design and bodywork company, Heuliez. Most notable changes were the front part and bonnet and the sloping, rather than inverted, rear window on the saloon. The estate version of the Ami 8, the &#x27;Break&#x27; had a similar general appearance to that of the Ami 6 although the later car&#x27;s taillights were integrated into the rear wings.

The Ami Super, sometimes also called Ami 10, was a flat-4 variant powered by the engine of the GS and produced between 1973 and 1976.

The Ami Super was offered in the same three trim levels as the Ami 8, Luxe, Confort and Club on Saloon and Luxe and Confort on the &#x27;Break&#x27; versions. These trim differences were fairly minor with Luxe models having bench front and rear seats and vinyl floor matting. Confort trim offered reclining front seats in place of the front bench. The Club models can be considered the Pallas of the Ami range featured sound proofing pads on the floor and bulkhead, carpet including boot lining, stainless steel trim on the window frames and side rubbing strips on the doors and rear wings. Club trim was only available up to the end of the 1973 model year, after that point Ami 8 and Ami super were only available in Luxe and Confort specification.

From 1974 Ami super models were revamped to feature a double line graphic along the exterior of the body sides, either in black or silver depending on body colour, with slotted wheels and double line detailing on the hubcaps. The rear window also featured a graphic in white proclaiming &quot;Ami Super 1015cm³&quot;

As the Ami Super looked very much like an Ami 8, and could surprise many by demonstrating its dramatic performance advantage compared to the Ami 8 (55 hp compared to 32 hp). Quoted by &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine in the UK as a &quot;Q car par excellence&quot; sadly in France its 5CV tax rating made little sense in a small car and as a result sales were low compared to the Ami 8. In the UK however where no such tax penalties existed the Ami Super attracted healthy sales although is now a rare sight due to poor corrosion resistance, a feature suffered by many vehicles of this era.

The Ami Super production reached close to 42,000 in sedan and station wagon by February 1976. Production of the Ami 8 continued until early 1979 and reached in the region of 722,000 cars produced.

A small series of prototype coupés, the M35 were produced as test vehicles for loyal customers — testing the single-rotor Comotor Wankel engine, as also seen in the NSU Spider. A twin-rotor version of this engine reached production form with the NSU Ro 80 and GS Birotor.

==Production==
The Ami 6 was the first model manufactured at the new Citroën plant in Rennes opened in 1961, where later the Dyane and GS were manufactured.

*Spain
The Ami 6 and Ami 8 were also built by Citroën Hispania in Vigo (Spain) from 1967 to 1978, but they were never called &quot;Ami&quot; because of a legal problem with that name. The equivalences with French-built models are:
*Ami 6 berline: never built in Spain.
*Ami 6 break old model (M4 type engine): Citroën Estate 3cv.
*Ami 6 break new model (M28 type engine): Citroën Dynam.
*Ami 8 berline: Citroën 8 or C-8.
*Ami 8 break: Citroën 8 Familiar (or just Citroën Familiar).
*Yugoslavia
Beside Spain, in Europe Ami was also built in Yugoslavia, in Slovenian factory Cimos where many other Citroën models were produced for the Yugoslav market.

*Argentina
Out of Europe, the Ami 8 was made until 1978 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was only built in the estate version in either &quot;Club&quot; or &quot;Elysee&quot; trims. It was exported to Uruguay, Paraguay, and in CKD kits to Arica, Chile from 1976. Chilean assembly was shut down in favour of the Citroën CX in early 1978.

==Performance==
An Ami 6 tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1962 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 30.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £823 including taxes on the UK market.

==Model changes in detail==
The following table summarises information to distinguish Ami Models.

==Production figures and history==
Total production of the Ami models (except M35) reached 1,840,121 units according to the manufacturer&#x27;s data. It is divided between the models as follows:

<text>Nabiba Naftali Temu (20 April 1945 – 10 March 2003) was a Kenyan long-distance runner. He became Kenya&#x27;s first gold medalist when he won the 10,000 metres race at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.

==Biography==
Temu started systematic training in long-distance running at the age of 14. After completing school education, he served at the Kenyan Army. At the 1964 Olympics he was 49th in the marathon and failed to finish his 10,000 m race.

He won the silver medal in 5,000 m at the inaugural All-Africa Games in 1965, behind compatriot Kipchoge Keino. At the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, he beat the world record holder Ron Clarke to win the six mile race. Two days later, Temu finished fourth in the three miles.

At the Mexico Olympics, in the 10,000 m final, only Mamo Wolde from Ethiopia could keep to Temu&#x27;s pace. Mamo Wolde went to lead at the bell, but Temu passed him with 50 m remaining to win the gold. Four days later, he won a bronze medal in the 5,000 m, narrowly beaten by Mohammed Gammoudi from Tunisia and fellow countryman Kipchoge Keino. Temu also competed against Mamo Wolde
in the marathon, but Mamo Wolde broke away after the 30 km mark, while Temu finished 19th.

Temu&#x27;s career went downhill after 1968. He finished nineteenth in the 10,000 m at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games, and was eliminated in the 10,000 m heats at the 1972 Summer Olympics. He retired in 1973 to run a farm in North Mugirango, which was a gift from president Jomo Kenyatta. On 10 March 2003, he died of prostate cancer at the Kenyatta National Hospital, aged 57.

<text>Abstract Imagists is a term derived from a 1961 exhibition in the Guggenheim Museum, New York called &quot;American Abstract Expressionists and Imagists.&quot; This exhibition was the first in the series of programs for the investigation of tendencies in American and European painting and sculpture.

==Style==
It had been recognized that the paintings of Josef Albers, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb, Ad Reinhardt, Clyfford Still and Robert Motherwell were all very different yet the symbolic content was achieved &quot;through dramatic statement of isolated and highly simplified elements.&quot; 
In many cases the dramatic simplification was achieved by the use of:

*geometric means: Josef Albers; Franz Kline; Hans Hofmann
*compression: Grace Hartigan; George McNeil
*intricate elaboration of canvas surfaces: Richard Pousette-Dart; Robert Richenburg; John Ferren; Jimmy Ernst;
*isolated shapes or signs: Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell
*detailed over-all patterning of the canvas: William Baziotes
*simplified structure through the dominance of the large, unified color shapes: James Brooks, Esteban Vicente, Adja Yunkers, Cameron Booth; Giorgio Cavallon

In some cases there was a &quot;loss of the feeling and immediacy&quot; in the work.

<doc id="846968" wikidata="Q1750961" url="?curid=846968" title="Driver 3">
<text>Driver 3 (stylized as DRIV3R) is a 2004 action-adventure game, the third installment in the &quot;Driver&quot; series. It was developed by Reflections Interactive, published by Atari, and released on PlayStation 2, Xbox and mobile phones in June 2004, Microsoft Windows in March 2005, and Game Boy Advance in October 2005. The game&#x27;s story focuses on players assuming the role of John Tanner, an undercover FBI agent, as he investigates a car-smuggling ring across three countries, in order to identify and arrest its boss and learn who they are planning to sell a cache of stolen cars to. The game expanded upon its predecessors with on-foot sections, gun combat, and drive-by shooting, with virtual recreations of three major cities - Miami, Nice, and Istanbul - free-roam game mode, and an improvement to the series&#x27; film-making &quot;director mode&quot;.

&quot;Driver 3&quot; was a much-hyped and anticipated title, and although the game was a commercial success, it received mixed reviews upon release, except for the PC edition which received negative feedback from critics. While the graphics, story and driving were praised, criticism was focused on the on foot controls, awkward shooting mechanics, and performance issues, with some critics accusing Atari of rushing the game&#x27;s release to avoid competing with &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; later that year. Some publications referred to the game as disastrous. The game was succeeded by &quot;&quot; (2006), before being followed up by a direct sequel, &quot;&quot;, in 2011.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Driver 3&quot; focuses on a mixture of open-world gameplay conducted through a third-person perspective, with it possible to change to different camera angles at any time. The game consists of primarily single-player modes of gameplay - &quot;Undercover&quot;, the game&#x27;s story mode; &quot;Take A Ride&quot;, the game&#x27;s free-roam mode, which allows players to explore one of the three cities at their own pace; and &quot;Driving Games&quot;, a challenge mode consisting of three types of car-based games for players to try out, such as pursuing a fleeing criminal. As with previous installments, gameplay mostly focuses on driving around one of three settings, consisting of partial but faithful recreations of real-life cities, using a variety of vehicles based on real-life models, ranging from sedans and sports cars, to vans, trucks. Vehicles can be damaged over time, though players may freely leave their vehicle and switch to another within the current game world setting they are in at any time; the exception is vehicles that are mission critical to the game&#x27;s story mode, as losing these constitutes automatic failure. A notoriety system keeps track of the player&#x27;s actions - any unlawful action will raise this bar, with police pursuing the player if spotted by any, and the response to stopping them changing depending on the level of notoriety they have.

&quot;Driver 3&quot; introduces new gameplay mechanics to existing ones including motorbikes and speedboats, swimming, a health bar, and gun combat. Alongside being arrested by the cops or failing objectives in story mode, players can also fail if they run out of health without finding first aid kits to recover it. Combat focuses on the use of guns, based on real-life models and featuring a mixture of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles and sub-machine guns, and grenade launchers, to take down enemies; all weapons have a limit on ammo except for the lead character&#x27;s personal weapon, but more can be found from dealing with enemies, or around the game world setting being played in during Take A Ride.

In Undercover Mode, players conduct a series of missions in which they must complete objectives, dealing with tasks such as escaping pursuers, reaching locations, and taking down culprits. At times, the player must complete objectives within a specific condition, such as a time-limit, with failure resulting in the player having to restart the mission. In Take A Ride, players can freely explore either Miami, Nice or Istanbul, searching for secrets, which consist of special cars and a group of hostile NPCs based upon the character of Tommy Vercetti from &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. If the player completes a mission of the story or leaves Take A Ride, they can freely choose to edit a replay footage from their game with different camera angles and film effects (i.e. slow-motion). The amount of footage they can edit is pre-determined and restricted in size.

==Plot==
Undercover FBI agents John Tanner (Michael Madsen) and Tobias Jones (Ving Rhames) are sent to Miami to investigate the &quot;South Beach&quot; cartel headed by Calita Martinez (Michelle Rodriguez), and her associates Lomaz and Bad Hand. When the agents notice the cartel’s recent acquisition of stolen cars, they suspect that they are working for someone else to fulfill a major order. To determine where the deal for the cars will take place, Tanner poses as a wheelman and infiltrates the cartel by recovering a car from a rival gang. After impressing Calita and earning her trust with a series of tasks, Tanner is assigned to assassinate &quot;The Gator&quot; for betraying the cartel.

South Beach relocate to Nice, France, after The Gator&#x27;s presumed demise, to secure the remaining cars on their list. Tanner makes contact with Interpol agents Vauban and Dubois, who insist on arresting the cartel while in possession of the stolen cars. Tanner refuses, and Vauban orders Dubois to conduct surveillance on the cartel. Meanwhile, Tanner focuses on acquiring the cars for Calita while fending off attacks by a rival syndicate, eventually leading to a confrontation wherein he eliminates the gang&#x27;s leader. Upon discovering that Dubois was captured by the cartel during his investigation, Tanner rushes to rescue him before he is executed. Following the rescue attempt, Tanner and Dubois break into a cartel boathouse to find out the location of the deal, which will take place in Istanbul, Turkey.

Shortly after, the two are captured by the cartel, and meet their employer, Charles Jericho (Mickey Rourke). After revealing Tanner&#x27;s identity, Jericho takes Tanner&#x27;s gun and uses it to murder Dubois, intending to frame him for the crime. Tanner manages to escape, and makes contact with Vauban about where the cars are being shipped to, but releases little detail on Dubois&#x27; death. They travel to Istanbul, where Tanner tails Jericho to a meeting with the Bagman, a middleman arranging the sale of the cars to Russian criminals. Overhearing that The Gator survived his assassination, Tanner asks Jones to collect him before he is killed by Jericho&#x27;s people, and The Gator offers information on the deal in exchange for his safety.

After reuniting with Jones, Tanner is accused of murder by Vauban, after he receives word of Dubois’ death. Despite the threat of an Internal Affairs investigation, Tanner and Jones go rogue to continue investigating, and focus on tracking down Lomaz. In exchange for protection, Lomaz reveals that Calita and the Bagman are set to meet soon to exchange money for the stolen cars. Tanner and Jones monitor the meeting until Calita calls it off. While Jones attempts to pursue the Bagman, he is ambushed and forced to pull back; meanwhile, Tanner chases after Calita and captures her. After bringing her to Vauban to regain his trust, Tanner convinces Calita that Jericho is too dangerous to trust. Calita reveals that the cars have already been shipped to Russia, and that Jericho will not leave the city until he is paid.

With assistance from Istanbul&#x27;s police, Tanner, Jones and Vauban stake out the arranged location of the exchange between Jericho and the Bagman. When the meeting takes place, Jericho murders the Bagman for providing him only half of the agreed money and fools police by using Bad Hand as a decoy, eventually leading to his death. Upon learning that Jericho will likely leave by train, Tanner cuts him off, forcing him to disembark and flee through the streets. When Jericho is cornered in an alleyway, Tanner critically wounds him, but eventually decides to have him arrested, only for Jericho to gun him down when he turns his back on him. .

==Development and release==
The game had a development budget of $17 million and a marketing budget of $17 million.
The game was in development for around three and a half years. Special attention was paid in rendering the cities of Miami, Nice, and Istanbul. The in-game music was composed by Marc Canham, Rich Aitken, and Narco. Atari also shot a short promotional video about &quot;Driver 3&quot; called &quot;Run the Gauntlet&quot;.

The game was originally announced by Infogrames on 17 July 2002 for a 2003 release. Initially scheduled to release in Q4 2003, it was delayed to Q2 2004, and again from March to June of 2004. It was eventually released under Atari&#x27;s publishing label for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004 on 21 June in North America, 22 June in the United Kingdom, and on 24 June in Australia. The mobile version, developed and published by Sorrent, was released on the same day as the North American console versions. It was developed on both Java and BREW platforms. A Windows port of the game touted as having an enhanced graphics engine was released on 15 March 2005 in North America, 18 March 2005 in the United Kingdom, and on 13 April 2005 in Australia. Developed by Velez &amp; Dubail, a separate version of the game was released in 2005 for Game Boy Advance in the United Kingdom on 14 October, in North America on 25 October, and in Australia on 28 October. Further ports for GameCube and N-Gage were planned, but later cancelled.

==Reception==

&quot;Driver 3&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews on all platforms except the PC version, which received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

&quot;The Times&quot; gave it all five stars, saying: &quot;The graphics are divine, with vast urban locales and spectacular crashes. The cars handle well, and each vehicle has its own characteristics. Yet this is no easy driving game — one of the reasons why, subject matter aside, it carries a 16+ rating&quot;. &quot;Playboy&quot; gave it an 88% and stated: &quot;Your investigation jump-starts reckless car chases through more than 150 miles of highways and city streets in detailed re-creations of Miami, Nice, and Istanbul. Slam into any of the 30,000 buildings and your car crumbles realistically&quot;. However, &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave it three stars out of five and called its controls and animation &quot;unresponsive and stiff&quot;.

===&quot;DRIV3Rgate&quot;===
While &quot;Driver 3&quot; received mostly mixed reviews, two outlets operated by Future plc, &quot;PSM2&quot; and &quot;Xbox World&quot;, gave the game 9/10 scores. This disparity led some gamers and journalists to claim that the early access Atari gave Future was contingent on receiving favorable ratings, but Atari and Future denied any wrongdoing. The incident was dubbed &quot;Driv3rgate&quot;.

After the accusations of review fixing arose, the GamesRadar forums (also operated by Future) were filled with critical posts, many of which were deleted by moderators. Although the comments were said to be removed for being libelous, some users suspected a cover-up. Some comments defending &quot;Driver 3&quot; and Future were traced by forum moderators to Babel Media, a marketing company that made use of astroturfing. The users admitted they worked for Babel, but said that they were posting on their own behalf, not for Babel. The thread was eventually deleted in its entirety.

===Sales===
The PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Driver 3&quot; received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game sold more than 3 million copies by December 2004.

The BREW mobile version of &quot;Driver 3&quot; was the ninth most downloaded game on Verizon Wireless&#x27;s Get It Now service from January to May 2005.

<doc id="846974" wikidata="Q3254694" url="?curid=846974" title="List of rulers of Wadai">
<text>The rulers of the [[Wadai Sultanate]] ruled a territory today located in the north of the Republic of Chad.

There have been three states of Wadai, with the first dated to pre-1500. In the 14th century, Wadai became a &quot;quasi independent&quot; state of the Maba people but was destroyed at end of the 15th century. A second Wadai state grew out of the first and was conquered by the Tunjur kingdom in the 16th century. In 1611, a Maba named Abd al-Krim expelled the Tunjur and became the first &quot;Kolak&quot; (King) in 1635, marking the beginning of the third Wadai state. France invaded Wadai in 1909 and annexed it to the territory of Chad. French military rule ended in 1935 and a new &quot;Kolak&quot; was installed, though with very limited powers over the Ouaddaï prefecture. The state was suppressed France from 1912 to 1935 and by the Chad government from 1960 to 1970.

The current &quot;Kolak&quot; Cherif Abdelhadi Mahdi was appointed by the central government of Chad, which caused uproar because he was not related to his predecessor. However, he is descended from &quot;Kolak&quot; Muhammad Sharif (r. 1843–1858). The previous &quot;Kolak&quot; was dismissed in July 2019 following ethnic clashes in the region.

<doc id="846981" wikidata="Q1408858" url="?curid=846981" title="Boden Fortress">
<text>Boden Fortress () is a modern fortress consisting of several major and minor forts and fortifications surrounding the city of Boden, Norrbotten, in northern Sweden. The fortress was originally intended to stop or delay attacks from the east or coastal assaults, which at the time of construction meant Russian attacks launched from Finland. It was primarily the expansion of the railway network in Norrland, which in turn was a consequence of the rising importance of the northern iron ore fields, that led to the increased strategic value of northern Sweden and the construction of the fortress. Although the main forts were finished in 1908, many of the supporting fortifications were not completed until the start of the First World War. Improvements were also continuously made during, and between, both World Wars.

Boden Fortress is made up of five primary self-supporting forts excavated out of the bedrock in five of the mountains surrounding Boden: Degerberget, Mjösjöberget, Gammelängsberget, Södra Åberget and Rödberget. Eight fortified secondary artillery positions were constructed between the forts to give flanking support and to cover areas not in range of the main forts&#x27; artillery. In addition, 40 bunkers for infantry, along with dugouts and other fortifications, were built to cover even more terrain. During the Second World War anti-tank gun emplacements and additional bunkers and shelters were built, and tens of kilometres of dragon&#x27;s teeth were placed around the fortress and the city itself. Owing to the end of the Cold War and the reduction of the threat from the Soviet Union, Boden Fortress became less important to the defence of Sweden, and began to be decommissioned. The last fort of the complex was decommissioned on 31 December 1998, and is now used as a tourist attraction. All five forts as well as some of the supporting structures have been declared historic buildings, to be preserved for the future, by the Swedish government.

== Background ==

=== Central and peripheral defence ===
The two dominating theories of how to use fortifications in the operational perspective during the 18th and 19th centuries were the central fortress system () and the peripheral fortress system (), the latter also called the cordon system. The two systems were also known as central defence and peripheral defence. The peripheral defence theory was based on building smaller fortifications in advance positions to meet the enemy at an early stage, while the central defence theory was meant to weaken the enemy step by step in minor skirmishes and ambushes carried out by forces supplied and supported by central fortresses not located in the front line. In short, one theory advocated many minor fortifications built to directly engage the enemy, while the other advocated only a few major fortifications built not to directly engage the enemy, but to support the troops that engaged the enemy.

In the beginning of the 19th century the peripheral system—at least in Sweden—was deemed unmodern, due to the extremely long border and coastline of the country, which required a lot of personnel to maintain and support, leading to high costs and a neglect of the more mobile armed forces. The peripheral system was also meant to contain the enemy to a specific area, the coast and borders, but as time went and new tactics were taken into practice, the thin line of fortifications would be easily penetrated by the enemy forces, and when the enemy had advanced through the peripheral line, there would not be enough troops in the hinterland to stop the attacker. The central fortress system was better adjusted to defence in depth, it was not until the enemy attack had reached its culminating point that full counter-attacks would be launched. The central defence had also proven effective in the Seven Years&#x27; War—used by Frederick II of Prussia—and in Napoleon&#x27;s Invasion of Russia—used by the Russians. Carl von Clausewitz, in his military treatise &quot;On War&quot;, even mentioned Sweden&#x27;s good conditions for this kind of war of attrition:

The fourth principle, the &quot;Assistance of the Theatre of War&quot;, is naturally an advantage on the side of the defensive. [...] the army on the defensive continues to keep up its connection with everything, that is, it enjoys the support of its fortresses, is not weakened in any way, and is near to its sources of supply. [...] The campaign of 1812, gives as it were in a magnifying glass a very clear illustration of the effect of the means specified under principles 3 and 4. [...] It is true that with the exception of Sweden there is no country in Europe which is situated like Russia, but the efficient principle is always the same, the only distinction being in the greater or less degree of its strength.

=== Fortification of Sweden ===
Sweden had just lost one third of its population, as Russia had conquered the eastern part and created the Grand Duchy of Finland out of it during the Finnish War in 1808–1809. Shortly after, in 1814, the west flank had been secured by the personal union with Norway, and after the Napoleonic Wars, the former main enemy of Sweden in the south, Denmark, was no longer any threat. The only threat left was Russia, which now stood just across the border in the north, and had possession of the Åland Islands less than 150 km from the Swedish capital Stockholm. The Swedish Navy was considered superior to the Russian in the Gulf of Bothnia, so a seaborne invasion against the coast of Norrland was not likely. And even though the Russians had invaded northern Sweden via Finland in the previous war, the general opinion was that in case of a new war, their main attack would be conducted towards Stockholm and southern Sweden.

This opinion led to the thought of finding a good rear defence area where the Estates and the Swedish government could move if the capital was in danger. This in turn naturally strengthened the central defence theory. The core land () would be the place from where the main part of the field army would conduct its operations, supported by a few fortresses. The area between the two large lakes of Vänern and Vättern was the choice for this core land, with approximately the same border as Skaraborg County. Sweden above the province of Dalarna was not even considered to be included in this strategy. The realisation of the middle Sweden central defence system was finally made 5 February 1819 when King Charles XIV John decided that one main fortress, the central fortress, and two smaller &quot;operational fortresses&quot; were to be built. The central fortress became Karlsborg Fortress at Karlsborg, while the two operational fortresses meant to be located at either end of Vättern never were built due to lack of funds.

While Norrland was not supposed to be included in this main central defence strategy, studies on how to defend this major part of the country were still conducted. However, northern Sweden was generally considered of very limited military interest and unsuitable for larger military operations due to the bad state of most of the roads, the large uninhabited areas, the large rivers and the very limited economical gain that the lands provided. The first of these studies, laid down by the Fortification Committee of 1819 ()—which was largely influenced by the committee&#x27;s secretary Johan Peter Lefrén—led to nothing more than the opinion that the large rivers up north—especially the Ångerman River—would benefit the defence and that no major fortifications were to be built. In another study from 1824, colonel—and much later Swedish Minister for War—Gustaf Oscar Peyron suggested that it would be better to fortify positions just south of Boden—along the more northern Lule River—for example at Sävast or Avan. However no major changes were made, partially due to the limited military interest, but also because of the large amounts of money that was spent on building Karlsborg Fortress and modernizing other older fortifications in southern Sweden.

=== Railroads speed up planning ===
It was not until fifteen years later, when yet another committee—the Coastal Fortification Committee of 1839 ()—studied the defence of Norrland, that the Swedish Armed Forces started to focus a bit more on the northern provinces. This study however mainly presented plans for middle Norrland, and the provinces of Medelpad, Ångermanland and Jämtland. Those provinces had a more significant role as it was there that the main roads of Sweden started to intersect with the road network of Norway, which at the time was allied with Sweden. The road network north of this area consisted of the large coastal road—the only major north–south road—from Haparanda and all the way through Norrland down to Gävle. All the other major roads exclusively ran southeast–northwest—following the run of the large rivers—before ending in wilderness and thus did not provide any route further west into Norway and on to the Atlantic coast. The plans to strengthen Norrland by building a central fortress either on Frösön outside Östersund, or closer to the coast at Borgsjö outside Ånge, once again fell flat due to lack of money and lower priority compared to fortifications in southern Sweden.

By the 1860s, the first Swedish railway main lines () were completed in the southern part of the country, and by 1881 the Northern Main Line had reached Ånge. This, and the opening of the railway line connecting Sundsvall–Östersund–Trondheim (the Central and Meråker Lines) a year later strengthened the plans for a defensive line in the middlemost provinces of Norrland. At the same time, on the other side of the Bothnian Gulf, the Finnish main railway to Oulu had almost been completed, and would soon be of great use for the Russians to transport military personnel and supplies towards the Swedish border in case of war. Combined with the planned Luleå–Boden–Gällivare–Kiruna–Narvik railway stretch (the Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines), this would pose a great opportunity for the Russians to fulfill their latent wish to seize control of northern Scandinavia and the Atlantic ports on the Norwegian coast. At least according to some officers—both Swedish and Norwegian—which in the second half of the 1880s noticed the increased strategic importance of northern Scandinavia and Lapland as an effect of the construction of the railway lines in the area. This was also noticed by the Riksdag member Johan Erik Nyström from Norrbotten&#x27;s electoral district who—worried about the railway to Oulu—put forward a motion about strengthening the Upper Norrland defence in 1885. The length of the railway lines started to affect strategic planning, and in some cases military decisions influenced the planning of new railway lines.

Even though the northernmost stretch of the Main Line Through Upper Norrland had long been planned, it was not until 1887 and the victory of the Lantmanna Party&#x27;s protectionist wing in that year&#x27;s election that the financial means—from increased trade tariff income—and the political will allowed the completion of the railway through Överluleå, which Boden was sometimes called. The &quot;slumbering resources and the rapid expansion&quot; in Upper Norrland were two reasons to build a railway to the sparsely populated area; another factor that had a big part in the decision to complete the main line was the government&#x27;s takeover of the Luleå–Gällivare line, which had previously been in the hands of an English company. The stretch was very lucrative, as it considerably eased the transport of iron ore from the ore fields around Kiruna and Gällivare down to the coast for further transport by boat. Another English company had in the 1860s tried to construct a combination of a railway and a canal—the English Canal—for the stretch, but went bankrupt before their plans were completed. The company contracted for the new railway line experienced similar economic difficulties and the Swedish state decided to buy the nearly completed line to finish it in 1891.

The decision to complete the railway through to Boden sparked interest in Norrbotten among the members of the Swedish General Staff, and the chief, Axel Rappe, conducted a survey trip to the region in 1887. His report mentioned the changed strategic options due to the railway lines on both sides of the Gulf and a need for some kind of fortification in Boden, but he also toned down the earlier thoughts on the Russian interest in the Luleå–Narvik line. Rappe&#x27;s report directly affected the future stretch of the railway line in Norrbotten. His recommendations, largely based on his and the General Staff&#x27;s military planning, not to build the line along the coast, or build it all the way to the Swedish-Finnish border at Haparanda were later followed. The subsequent report completed in 1890 by the Neutrality Committee of 1888 ()—with Axel Rappe as one of its members—suggested that a credible neutrality required an increased defence of the north-eastern border and proposed a budget of 1.3 million Swedish kronor, corresponding in today&#x27;s money to around US$11 million (as of 2011), for the construction of permanent fortifications in Boden.

== Reason and decision ==

=== Why Boden? ===
The following year, in 1891, Rappe wrote a memorandum that explained in more detail the budget, which suddenly had risen to 4.5 million kronor, and would finance the construction of two strongholds at Paglaberget and Åberget with a total of six long cannon, ten howitzers and eight quick-firing cannon, all in armoured turrets, along with machine guns and bunkers, barracks and supply depots. The plan included a reserve battalion of 1,000 men, an artillery battalion of 600 men, an engineer company of 120 men, and supply and depot personnel. Axel Rappe&#x27;s large study on the permanent fortifications of Sweden—a mandate given to him in 1882—was published in 1892 and cemented the view that a central fortress was needed in Boden to support and supply troops gathering between the Lule River and the eastern border, alongside the strengthening of the coastal defences at Stockholm, Gothenburg and Karlskrona.

Although Rappe did not completely rule out the possibility of a German or British attack on southern Sweden if the opportunity arose, he felt that Russia was the most realistic threat. There were only two plausible scenarios for war with Russia: either Sweden would become involved in a war between Germany and Russia which would feature southern and central Sweden as the battleground—and Rappe made no attempt to hide which country the General Staff wanted Sweden to side with in that case—or Russia would make a limited attack on Norrbotten to reach northern Norway and the Atlantic, an attack that Rappe earlier said was not very likely. Rappe had played down the strategic importance of the Ofoten and Iron Ore Lines and played up the importance of the main railway line to Boden, which was under discussion at that time, to speed up its completion. The railway to Boden was nearly finished by 1892, negating the need for Rappe to play that political game any longer. A railway line to Boden was of utmost need to be able to bring up troops to Lule River—the main line of defence—and a future fortress there.

During the following years a fierce debate raged between the supporters of the army on one side and the navy on the other. The proposed expansion of Swedish fortifications nationwide, which in turn would see less money spent on the fleet, upset many naval proponents, amongst them Wilhelm Dyrssen—later Minister for Defence—and Fredrik von Otter—later Admiral and Prime Minister of Sweden. They argued that the theory of central defence would leave large swathes of Swedish land in the hands of the enemy, and instead suggested smaller fortifications at the border, along with a strengthened navy. The debate was inconclusive and a request for 500,000 kronor to initiate construction of the fortress was not accepted by the government. Instead, they wanted a committee to further investigate all Swedish fortifications and possible new constructions of such. Thus the Fortification Committee of 1897 () was formed. The committee, led by chairman Jesper Crusebjörn, discussed and examined the defence of Norrland thoroughly, and also travelled to Boden where they climbed most of the heights and mountains that were considered for the fortifications. The selection of Boden as the most suitable place for the fortification, according to the committee&#x27;s final report published 25 July 1898, had numerous reasons:
*The main rail line through Norrland crossed Lule River there.
*The intersection of the main line and the Luleå–Narvik line was located there.
*The most important road intersection in Norrbotten was located there.
*The most suitable river crossing sites over Lule River were located there.
*The distance to the coast was long enough to prevent a surprise attack by a naval landing force.
*The topography of the area was suitable for a modern fortress.

=== Final decision ===
The report calculated the costs at 8.7 million kronor which corresponds in today&#x27;s money to around $70 million (as of 2011), spent over a total construction schedule of one four-year period and two three-year periods. The cost was still considerably lower than that of many of the recently built or modernised fortifications on the continent; Belgium had spent the equivalent of 62 million kronor on the fortified positions of Liège and Namur along the Meuse while Romania had spent 63 million kronor to strengthen the defence of Bucharest and 16 million kronor on fortifications along the Siret. In 1899, Rappe proposed to the Riksdag—in line with the plans of the Fortification Committee—that construction of already existing fortificatory works in Sweden would commence, while the question on Boden would be postponed to the next year. The plan gained support from the first chamber but not from the second chamber, but when put to a joint vote of both chambers, the proposition passed. Even though the result did not really mean anything concrete for the possible construction in Boden, it was considered a great success for that question as well. During the last years of the century, the Riksdag&#x27;s general attitude towards the army became more positive, most likely due to the increased Russification of Finland, increased tension in the Union between Sweden and Norway, and rumors that the Russian sawfilers that worked in Sweden also worked for the Okhrana, the secret Russian police.

Despite this progress, Axel Rappe left as Minister for War in 1899, due to setbacks on other issues. He was replaced by Jesper Crusebjörn, who inherited the Boden fortification project. Crusebjörn followed in the footsteps of Rappe—described as &quot;the spiritual father of Boden Fortress&quot; thanks to his efforts—as he proposed, in accordance with the committee&#x27;s plan, that the Riksdag should allocate an initial sum of 560,000 kronor which would be used to initiate construction of Boden Fortress. Crusebjörn also maintained the belief of his predecessor, and of the committee in which he was chairman, that Boden Fortress when completed should act as the operational base for all troops attached for the defence of Norrbotten, that it should serve as a supply fortress for troops stationed between it and the front line, and that it also should serve as a blocking fortress in case of a Russian surprise attack. The 1897 committee also had set the goal to have Boden Fortress in a finished state when the Haparanda Line found its way through to the border against Finland.

The result of the votes—held 7 May 1900, a date which can be seen as the birth of the fortress—in the first and second chambers were the same as the previous year. The first chamber was overwhelmingly for the proposal with the result 108–16, but the proponents feared a defeat in the second chamber. During the debate both the Prime Minister of Sweden Erik Gustaf Boström and Jesper Crusebjörn threatened to resign from their posts if the proposal was not accepted, to exert pressure on the second chamber. Boström expressed the following that day:

For believe me gentlemen, I consider this question so important that in the same moment I get the definite answer that it is not embraced by the Swedish Riksdag, I will no longer stay in this place.

Even after this, the second chamber voted against the proposal, with a vote count of 73–130. Neither Boström nor Crusebjörn resigned, since after further discussion and voting it was decided that the matter should be settled by a joint vote. The first chamber voted in favor, 125–14, while the second chamber voted against, 87–135, with a total outcome of 212–149 in favour of constructing Boden Fortress and allocating the funds needed to start construction. Funding for the purchase of the land that the fortifications were to be built on had largely been provided several years in advance by two voluntary organisations. The Organisation for the Fortified Defence of Upper Norrland () and the Swedish Women&#x27;s Organisation () had collected 71,000 kronor out of the 131,000 kronor needed for land purchase.

== Construction ==

=== Initial work ===
The main inspiration for the design—in which the forts are blasted into the mountains rather than constructed on top of them—came from Vaberget Fortress near Karlsborg Fortress. Vaberget Fortress was built in the 1890s and its southern fort was the first fort in the world that fully used the protection provided by the bedrock itself by having all of its functions embedded in the mountain. Vaberget Fortress served as a prototype for Boden Fortress and many more future fortifications in Sweden, including the late 20th century fixed army and coastal artillery batteries that gave the Swedish Fortifications Agency world renown. Preparatory work was started in 1900 and consisted of a diverse number of tasks, ranging from purchase of beds for the construction workers, construction of a new loading site for the railway, building roads to the various construction sites and clearing the land of those sites. The plan for the Fortifications at Boden ()—which was the term used until the First World War when the present name Boden Fortress came into widespread use—was largely based on the proposal laid forward by the Fortification Committee of 1897, with only minor modifications.

Even before any construction work had started the cost of the forts had been estimated to exceed the previous calculations by fifty percent. In December 1901, only few months after the first blasting work that had been done at Gammelängsberget in July 1901, the cost for the four forts northeast of the river was expected to be sixty-five percent more expensive than the initial calculation. The blueprints of the forts at Degerberget, Gammelängsberget and Södra Åberget were the first to be confirmed, which happened on 11 May 1901. The fort at Mjösjöberget followed suit on 3 April 1902 and the last fort to get a confirmed blueprint was the fort at Rödberget, on 19 May 1903. The last proposed fort, at Paglaberget, was deleted from the plans in 1906—along with the batteries at Fällberget and Slumpberget as well as the fortifications at Avan and Svartbyträsket—before any work on the fort had started, due to the proposal of the new Fortification Committee of 1905, which was formed following the reports of the large rise in costs. On 9 February 1906, the current Minister for War Lars Tingsten calculated the total cost to end at 19,220,000 kronor, more than twice the cost reported by the 1897 committee.

All work on the large masses of bedrock was conducted by hand, without any help of powered machines, as the first power station in Boden was not constructed until almost ten years later in 1909. The first work that was done at the site was to create a large ditch, wide and with a depth of or more, that would surround the core of the fort. Creating patrol trenches and placements for the turrets on the top of the forts was also work done early on. The teams of workers would first bore down in the bedrock using pinch bars and sledgehammers, then use black powder to blast the rock into manageable pieces which could be transported away from the site, using wheelbarrows, horse-drawn carriages and in some cases Decauville railways. When the ditch, or parts of it, had been completed, work started on the inner part of the fort by boring horizontally from the bottom of the ditch into the mountain itself. This work was a lot harder—the cost for each cubic metre of blasted tunnel was five times the cost of a cubic metre of blasted ditch—both due to the confined space in the tunnels and the risk of damaging the bedrock. The use of black powder instead of dynamite reduced the risk of bedrock damage, but it also increased the time needed to complete the tunnels. All in all, the amount of bedrock bored, blasted, loaded and transported away from the forts has been estimated to be around .

=== Finishing touches ===
When the ditches and tunnels were finished, concrete works started, including flooring, construction of joist systems in forts with second floors, staircases, partition walls and counterscarp galleries. Water wells were bored to a depth of up to to guarantee water supply, since the forts were supposed to be self-supporting. However, the most demanding part of the project was the construction, transport and installation of the armoured turrets and the armament itself. Two companies had been previously contracted for the construction of other fortifications in Sweden, Swedish AB Bofors-Gullspång and French Compagnie des Forges de Châtillon, offers from both companies existed already in 1901, but it was not until after tests conducted in December 1902 that the Swedish company was contracted and given royal approval on 26 May 1903. The order was for the and pieces that was to be mounted on the first three forts. The following two forts at Rödberget and Mjösjöberget were to have pieces, an order Bofors would get as well, but due to the time factor a few of those were actually delivered by the French company.

The cost of a single armoured turret for a 12 cm piece was almost 100,000 kronor—around $800,000 (as of 2011) in today&#x27;s money—and it could weigh as much as . It was delivered in parts to simplify transport, but the heaviest part still had a weight of . The parts were delivered by rail up to Boden and unloaded with the help of gantry cranes. As the roads of the time could not handle the weight during summer, transport had to wait until winter when the frost had hardened the ground. The turret parts were lifted onto sleighs drawn by 16–30 horses depending on the situation. The toughest stretch, up the mountain, was handled with the help of block and tackle, the ditch was crossed on temporarily built sturdy wooden bridges and the mounting of the turret was finished with cranes. A major part of the mounts for the turrets were completed by the end of 1905, despite the harsh winter working conditions, with temperatures falling below at times. The peak workforce amounted to around 900 men, but their numbers fluctuated, with the lowest number of active workers during the winter months. The first artillery test firing was conducted on 15 January 1907 when the guns at Gammelängsberget fired their first rounds, and all five forts &quot;were in a defensible state&quot; by 1908.

=== Other fortification works ===
Apart from the forts, the garrison itself was heavily expanded during the initial construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even at the start of the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill the holes in between them. It was realised that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called &quot;fästen&quot;, strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outside—the other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a bunker and others behind a parapet.

The main fortifications for infantry consisted of 44 concrete bunkers, 23 dugouts and 26 fortified observation posts. The concrete bunkers (, redoubts) were long and narrow. The longest, Abramsskansen, was long and had room for 160 men and four machine guns, but most had room for less than 80 men—usually a rifle platoon reinforced with a machine gun section and an anti-tank section. Due to their length, their curved shapes following the mountain sides, and other characteristics, the bunkers were popularly referred to as &quot;sausages&quot; (). The construction of these started in 1911. Many officers still considered the fortress to have inadequate and too few fortifications for the infantry, and one officer compared the fortress to &quot;a shoe, which is too large for the foot.&quot; One million kronor was allocated in 1915 to fix that problem, and many minor fortifications were built during the First World War.

Blockhouses were also built by the railway bridge at Trångforsen and the road bridge Hedenbron (built from 1911 to 1912), located just southeast of the Trångforsen bridge. The later was built to accommodate easier access to Rödberget Fort and the military training area on the southwestern shore of Lule River and was at the time of completion the longest single span road bridge in Sweden.

Both internal and external communication systems as well as means of reconnaissance were needed, both directed by the commandant located in the headquarters building. The building—finished in 1910—had three floors, the upper two functioned as home and workplace for the commandant and the chief of staff, while the ground floor had extra thick walls and functioned as the command post for the fortress. A large field telephone network was built, connecting all forts with the headquarters. Liaison with higher commands was at first maintained by regular post, telegraph and telephone. The fortress&#x27; radio station was finished by 1914, originally for the Swedish Navy, and was located south of Degerberget on a bog now known as the &quot;Radio Mire&quot; (). The first Swedish radio broadcasts were sent from this building. The fortress also had homing pigeons for sending messages. At the end of the Second World War, around 280 such pigeons were stationed in Boden. The pigeons were part of the balloon department whose main task was to operate the balloon of the garrison. For this, the Balloon Hangar with inner measurements of was built near the radio station. More than fifty men were attached to the department, of whom two could follow the balloon up to its maximum height of , limited by the length of the wire connecting it to the ground. The hydrogen-filled balloon itself was of German make and measured in length, had a diameter of around and a total volume of .

== In operation ==

=== Two World Wars ===
Most parts of the fortress were finished during the First World War, and many minor works were started and completed during the course of the war. Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War, the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress. Finland&#x27;s independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia&#x27;s successor state, the Soviet Union, which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden, put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question. Only the most basic needs were satisfied during the interwar period; even apparent needs—based on the experiences from the war—such as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.

Only a few necessary projects were funded, including an underground headquarters bunker, improvement of the garrison hospital and new training areas. It was not until the increased tension in Europe following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome and the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War that focus once again was put on military readiness and prepared fortifications. Improvements were made to fortifications in many parts of Sweden during the last years of the 1930s following the German annexation of Austria and occupation of Czechoslovakia. In Boden, this included building underground storage rooms for ammunition and food, replenishing already existing stocks, increasing protection for other important supply functions—such as the waterworks—as well as further military planning and also preparations for destruction of—for an advancing enemy—important bridges and roads.

When the Second World War broke out, only limited resources were allotted to the defence of Northern Sweden, but following the Soviet attack on Finland a few months later and the German Operation Weserübung against Norway and Denmark the next year, major work on improving and extending the defensive lines was commenced. Bunkers, bomb shelters, gun emplacements—particularly for anti-tank guns—were built by the units that had been mobilised and stationed in the vicinity of Boden. The Finnish experiences gained from meeting superior armoured forces during the Winter War were adopted in Sweden, and triple rows of large stones or blocks of reinforced concrete, dragon&#x27;s teeth, soon formed a continuous line—defended by anti-tank guns in concrete bunkers and machine-gun nests—around the fortress and city. As the war continued and advances in most fields of warfare were made, Boden Fortress was continually improved to meet new or increased threats such as air, armoured or gas attacks. The command, supply and intelligence services were improved as well.

As Sweden has remained neutral since 1816, Boden Fortress was never put to the test. Nonetheless, there are a few indications on how Boden, the garrison, the fortress and its crew would have come through a wartime attack. Already in 1904, Lars Tingsten—commander of Norrbotten Regiment, later Minister for War and first commander of Boden Fortress—expressed worries over the low number of soldiers that were planned to garrison the town. The 1892 army war plans had two infantry battalions stationed in the area, and allowed for three or four more to be transferred there, while Tingsten reported that the battalions should number at least 24 and perhaps even 33. The lack of personnel, and even more the lack of organisation, was shown when the fortress was tested against a coup de main during a military exercise in April 1913. Led by its commander Bror Munck, the cavalry regiment Crown Prince&#x27;s Hussar Regiment managed to seize control of the railway station, the railway bridge, the ordnance depot, the electric works and the waterworks in the matter of a day. When the unit reached the headquarters building, Tingsten, now commandant of the fortress, saw his earlier worries come true. Despite this, the wartime infantry garrison was no more than four battalions in 1937. But as the Second World War came to its end, the fortress had been given a new role. From 1943 on it was no longer meant to stand on its own against a besieging enemy, and instead became only one piece in a larger network of fortifications. The wartime strength was never more than 12,000–13,000 men, while calculations talked about at least 25,000 men, up to 40,000 men, were needed to withstand a siege.

=== Espionage ===
Strict secrecy surrounded the fortress for a very long time, and there were several attempts made by foreign powers to gain knowledge of various kinds of information. One early possible attempt at espionage were the Russian sawfilers who travelled through Sweden, mostly in Norrland during the last years of the 19th century and the years leading up to World War I. A large part of the Swedish population believed that the sawfilers, no more than 300 in total in Sweden, were spies hired by the Okhrana, the Russian secret police. Some sources are of the belief that the sawfilers were never sent out on specific missions but instead acted as unknowing spies, only having contact with the Okhrana who interrogated them regarding their experiences when they returned to Russia. Other sources claim that at least some of the sawfilers that the Okhrana found most useful were educated in the art of espionage, and were in fact given specific missions, as well as being paid 300 rouble per season for their work. Another form of this kind of legal espionage is believed to have been conducted by the German Wandervogel movement during the late interwar period.

The first known attempt of purposeful espionage against the fortress was conducted in 1913–14. A former lieutenant in the Danish coastal artillery, A. B. Fredrikssen, was enlisted in Copenhagen by the Russian military attaché in Stockholm, colonel Assanovitch. Fredrikssen was sent to Boden with the task to explore the fortress and its surroundings. He and his wife stayed at a boarding house in the city, and had regular correspondence with his employer who stayed in Copenhagen. It was also the correspondence that exposed the attempt, which was not very successful in terms of information gained by the Russians. They had better luck in late 1914 with two brothers named Hiukka, who both served with one of the artillery regiments in Boden, Norrland Artillery Regiment. They were discovered due to their extravagant living, and it was found out that one of the brothers—despite his employment in the army—had Finnish-Russian citizenship. They had provided intelligence to Russia, but the full extent of the affair was never disclosed. A minor case of German espionage was exposed during the Second World War. The first permanently stationed German officer in Luleå, a Hauptmann Schultz, was caught photographing parts of the fortifications and was deported. It is probable that his espionage was not ordered from any higher command but was an act on own initiative.

Two extensive espionage cases in Sweden during the Cold War involved Boden Fortress, both exposed in 1951. The Enbom case involved Fritiof Enbom, a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden, and later the local editor for the communist newspaper &quot;Norrskensflamman&quot;. He was exposed by his own careless talk—often under the influence of alcohol—to the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the Swedish Security Service after the Christmas holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952. During interrogation, he confessed that he—from February 1943 to April 1951—had met with Soviet employers around 25 times. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from public sources, but also secrets, of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of the pieces of information that concerned Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications. He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour, but was released after ten years. The other case involved Ernst Hilding Andersson, who was arrested on 21 September 1951. He had carried out seven missions for the Soviets and had provided them primarily with information regarding the Swedish Navy, but also information on the fortifications along the Norrland coast, and an initiated report about Boden Fortress and the air force unit located in Boden and Luleå, Norrbotten Air Base Corps. Andersson was, like Fritjof Enbom, sentenced to hard labour for life.

== End and aftermath ==

=== Cold War and decommission ===
The fortress was gradually modernised in the decades following the Second World War, including newer main artillery for some of the forts and newer secondary artillery for all forts as well as other improvements. But the development of new weapons and the evolution of warfare during the Cold War gradually decreased the importance of the fortifications. Weapons such as cruise missiles and smart bombs made large static fortifications such as Boden Fortress obsolete when they demonstrated their worth during the Gulf War in 1991. Mjösjöberget Fort had been decommissioned and removed from the wartime organisation twelve years earlier in 1979, and less than ten years after the Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the four other forts followed suit. The last shot was fired from Rödberget on 14:11 local time on 31 December 1997, and exactly one year later, on 31 December 1998, that last fort was decommissioned after 90 years in service.

All five forts and three battery positions—Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Södra Slumpberget—were declared historic buildings in the summer of 1998 and are to be preserved for the future. The balloon hangar, the only of its kind in Sweden, was declared a historic building three years later in 2001. Two forts, Rödberget and Södra Åberget, are held in operation, and the former is used as a tourist attraction with guided tours, and there is also a possibility for companies to hold smaller conferences inside the fort. Over 10,000 visitors were expected to visit Rödberget Fort in 2002, averaging 300 a day during the summer. Boden Fortress is also still one of the salute batteries of Sweden, which fire a 21-gun salute at special occasions such as the National holiday of Sweden and birthdays of some members of the Swedish Royal Family. The fortress was made a salute battery on 2 June 1931, but since the forts have been decommissioned, the salute is now fired with four cannon located at Kvarnängen in central Boden.

Due to the strict security surrounding the garrison, many rumours circulated during the fortress&#x27; lifetime. Some were later dismissed as myths or as disinformation, but others were confirmed. One common rumour was that the artillery of the main forts had a range of fire that made it possible to shoot at the important Luleå harbour more than away, but in reality, the maximum range of the farthest shooting pieces was less than half of that. Another widespread myth was that all the forts were connected to each other with a complex system of tunnels beneath the city. However, one has been confirmed, that the forts were used as storage for a large part of the Swedish gold reserve. Around a third of the total Swedish gold holdings of was kept in Degerberget Fort from 1941—transported there disguised as boxes of ammunition—until the last ingots were brought from the fort by six armoured cars in 1982 as the fort no longer was to have around-the-clock surveillance.

The total construction cost of Boden Fortress—somewhere around 20 million kronor at the time—would correspond to almost 1 billion kronor (as of 2011) according to the consumer price index which the government agency Statistics Sweden uses. Despite this, the cost has been claimed to correspond to 4 billion kronor of today, and it has also been claimed that the project was more expensive than the JAS 39 Gripen project, which cost 106 billion kronor in total, each aircraft costing between 300 and 500 million kronor depending on what to include in the calculation. No matter what the actual cost was, opinions on Boden Fortress differ markedly, from being called a boastful project and the &quot;JAS project of the turn of the century&quot; to one of the reasons that kept Sweden out of two World Wars. The fortress also had a psychological aspect, in that its mere existence kept a firm grip of peoples&#x27; minds—essentially functioning as a morale booster—during times when Sweden was in the shadow of war.

== Forts ==

=== Degerberget ===
Degerberget Fort () was planned and constructed on Degerberget Mountain, north of Boden and west of the lake Buddbyträsket, between 1900 and 1908. It was the only fort in the northern fort group as defined in the 1914 defensive plans for Boden Fortress. The main artillery consisted of four kanon m/99, backed up by another four kanon m/94-04 which were replaced by 8.4 cm kanon m/47 in the early 1950s. Surrounded by a caponier ditch on all sides, the fort area also features one observation post, two searchlight sites and two larger bunkers. Part of the Swedish gold reserve was kept here from 1941 to 1982. Degerberget Fort was decommissioned in 1992 together with Gammelängsberget Fort.

=== Mjösjöberget ===
Mjösjöberget Fort () was planned and constructed between 1900 and 1908. A part of the eastern fort group together with Gammelängsberget Fort, it was situated on Mjösjöberget Mountain to the east of Boden. As Rödberget Fort it was fitted with the fästningshaubits m/06 as main artillery, together with the standard secondary 8.4 cm cannon and tertiary caponier cannon. Since Rödberget Fort was refitted with new main artillery in the 1970s, Mjösjöberget Fort is the only to still feature 15 cm main artillery as it was decommissioned in 1979, some 20 years earlier than the other forts. Like the other two forts northeast of Boden, it is surrounded on all sides by a ditch. The fort also has a large bunker and two searchlight sites close by.

=== Gammelängsberget ===
Planned and constructed between 1900 and 1908, Gammelängsberget Fort () situated on Gammelängsberget Mountain east of Boden was the first of the five forts to be finished and the first to fire any guns when a test firing was conducted in 1907. It was part of the eastern fort group—together with the close by Mjösjöberget Fort—in the 1914 defensive plans. Just as on the other forts, the original secondary guns, 8.4 cm kanon m/94-04, were replaced by 8.4 cm kanon m/47 between 1950 and 1952. The main artillery, 12 cm kanon m/99, and the caponier artillery, 57 mm kaponjärkanon m/07, served with the fort until it was closed down in 1992. Gammelängsberget Fort is surrounded by a caponier ditch on all sides, and a large concrete bunker is located in proximity of the fort.

=== Södra Åberget ===
The only fort not to feature four distinct sides, Södra Åberget Fort () instead features the triangular design that was originally planned for all the forts, and the southwestern side is formed by the mountain scarp rather than a caponier ditch. The fort—planned and constructed on Södra Åberget Mountain south of Boden between 1902 and 1908—was together with Rödberget Fort part of the southern fort group. Södra Åberget Fort had the standard armament in the form of 12 cm kanon m/99, 8.4 cm kanon m/94-04 and 57 mm kaponjärkanon m/07. The 8.4 cm artillery was modernised between 1950 and 1952. Just like the neighbour Rödberget Fort on the other side of Lule River, Södra Åberget Fort has four bunkers, two observation posts and two searchlight sites in its surroundings.

=== Rödberget ===
Perhaps the best known of the five forts, Rödberget Fort (), situated on Rödberget Mountain southwest of Boden, was the last in line for construction, which started in 1903. The fort was finished in 1908 and originally featured four 15 cm fästningshaubits m/06 which in 1976 were replaced by four 12 cm kanon m/24 taken from scrapped Swedish Navy destroyers. At the same time, another two 12 cm cannon were fitted on a newly constructed small satellite fortification to the north of the fort. Rödberget Fort was part of the southern fort group together with Södra Åberget Fort on the other side of Lule River. These two forts—unlike the other forts—do not have a caponier ditch on all sides, as the western side of Rödberget Fort is protected by the natural scarp of the mountain. The surroundings feature four large bunkers, two observation posts and two searchlight sites. Today, Rödberget Fort is the only larger fortification of Boden Fortress that is open to the public.

== Commandants ==

During the first years in existence, the position was simply titled Commandant in Boden (), but from 1928 on, the officer in charge was Commandant in Boden Fortress (), and later on had additional commands connected to the position:
== In media ==
Boden Fortress is mentioned in Tage Danielsson&#x27;s &quot;Sagan om Karl-Bertil Jonssons julafton&quot;; the story was made into a short film in 1975 and has been shown on Sveriges Television every Christmas Eve since that year. Karl-Bertil Jonsson, the young boy of the story, works extra at the post office where he steals Christmas gifts addressed to rich people and instead gives them to the poor, Robin Hood-style. One of all the gifts he steals is a matchstick picture () of the fortress. When telling the intended receiver of the gift, senior administrative officer H. K. Bergdahl, what he had done Bergdahl answers &quot;Thank you, my lad, for saving us from Boden Fortress!&quot;

The fortress also plays a part in &quot;Operation Garbo&quot;, a three-volume novel written by Harry Winter, a pseudonym for an undisclosed number of people. The techno-thriller novel is about a Soviet invasion of Sweden, and while Boden Fortress is not a main part of the story, one chapter in the first volume briefly mentions Södra Åberget Fort, and two chapters in the second volume are devoted to events at and around the forts, Södra Åberget and Mjösjöberget Forts are mentioned by name while Rödberget Fort is described more in detail.

A 30-minute episode of the Swedish public broadcaster SVT&#x27;s series &quot;Hemliga svenska rum&quot; (&quot;Secret Swedish spaces&quot;) covered Boden Fortress and its secrets, lesser known facts and myths. The programme brought up the use of Degerberget Fort as storage for the gold reserve and other pieces of information from 100 years of Swedish military history about &quot;one of Sweden&#x27;s most peculiar and perhaps mightiest constructions&quot;.

<doc id="846983" wikidata="Q671670" url="?curid=846983" title="Voluntarism (philosophy)">
<text>Voluntarism is &quot;any metaphysical or psychological system that assigns to the will (Latin: &quot;voluntas&quot;) a more predominant role than that attributed to the intellect&quot;, or equivalently &quot;the doctrine that will is the basic factor, both in the universe and in human conduct&quot;. Voluntarism has appeared at various points throughout the history of philosophy, seeing application in the areas of metaphysics, psychology, political philosophy and theology.

The term voluntarism was introduced by Ferdinand Tönnies into the philosophical literature and particularly used by Wilhelm Wundt and Friedrich Paulsen.

== Theological voluntarism ==
=== Medieval theological voluntarism ===
Associated with Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (two of the foremost medieval scholastic philosophers), medieval theological voluntarism (not to be confused with meta-ethical theological voluntarism) is generally taken to be the philosophical emphasis on the divine will and human freedom over and above the intellect (). For example, Scotus held that morality comes from God&#x27;s will and choice rather than his intellect or knowledge. Accordingly, God should be defined as an omnipotent being whose actions should not and cannot be ultimately rationalized and explained through reason. As such, voluntarism is usually contrasted with intellectualism, championed by the scholastic Thomas Aquinas.

=== Theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy ===
Theological voluntarism also refers to theological commitments—that is, specific interpretations of doctrines of Christianity—arguably held by certain early modern natural philosophers such as Pierre Gassendi, Walter Charleton, Robert Boyle, Isaac Barrow and Isaac Newton. It resulted in an empirical approach associated with early modern science. Voluntarism therefore allows that faith or belief in God can be achieved by will as opposed to requiring a prior divine gift of faith to the individual. This notion holds at least in so far as it has found favor among some historians and philosophers (e.g. the historian Francis Oakley and the philosopher Michael B. Foster). A 20th-century theologian of voluntarism was James Luther Adams.

== Metaphysical voluntarism ==
A proponent of metaphysical voluntarism is 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. In his view, the will is not reasoning, but an irrational, unconscious urge in relation to which the intellect represents a secondary phenomenon. The will is actually the force at the core of all reality. This putting out of the drive–intention–vital dynamics later influenced Friedrich Nietzsche (will to power), Philipp Mainländer (will to die), Eduard von Hartmann, Julius Bahnsen and Sigmund Freud (will to pleasure).

== Epistemological voluntarism ==

In epistemology, epistemological voluntarism is the view that belief is a matter of the will rather than one of simply registering one&#x27;s cognitive attitude or degree of psychological certainty with respect to a stated proposition. If one is a voluntarist with respect to beliefs, it is coherent to simultaneously feel very certain about a particular proposition P and assign P a very low subjective probability. This is the basis of Bas van Fraassen&#x27;s reflection principle. See also: Doxastic voluntarism.

== Political voluntarism==
Political voluntarism, or voluntaryism, is the view that understands political authority to be will-based. This view which was propounded by theorists like Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and many members of the German idealist tradition understands political authority as emanating from a will.

== Marxist context ==
In Marxist discourse, voluntarism was used to designate a connection between a philosophical commitment to metaphysical voluntarism (especially Machism) and a political commitment to extreme revolutionary tactics, particularly associated with Alexander Bogdanov.

The Soviet Union promoted shock work during the First Five-Year Plan period in an effort to increase productivity through human effort in the absence of more developed machinery.

The Cuban Revolutionary Offensive sought to encourage voluntary labor in the countryside both to accelerate development of the socialist economy and to encourage the development of the socialist New Man ethos.

== Critical voluntarism ==
Hugo Dingler&#x27;s critical voluntarism in the philosophy of science is a form of conventionalism which posits that theorizing in the sciences starts with an unavoidable free decision of the will. The successor school of Dingler&#x27;s critical voluntarism is the methodical constructivism of the Erlangen School (cf. also the methodical culturalism of the Marburg School).

<text>Kay Mellor (née Daniel; 11 May 1951 – 15 May 2022) was an English actress, scriptwriter, producer and director. She was known for creating television series such as &quot;Band of Gold&quot; (ITV, 1995–97), &quot;Fat Friends&quot; (ITV, 2000–05), and &quot;The Syndicate&quot; (BBC, 2012–21), as well as co-creating CITV&#x27;s children&#x27;s drama &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot; (1989–2000).

==Early life==
Kay Daniel was born in Leeds on 11 May 1951 to a Catholic father, George, and a Jewish mother, Dinah. Her parents&#x27; marriage was unhappy, and Dinah suffered from George&#x27;s domestic violence. She had an affair before seeking a divorce. She raised her children as a single parent in Ireland Wood and kept the affair a secret for more than 30 years.

In 1967, Mellor become pregnant aged 16 and married the child&#x27;s father, Anthony Mellor, who was 17. The couple had two daughters, television producer Yvonne Francas (born 1968) and actress Gaynor Faye (born 1971).

When Mellor told her mother about being pregnant, she made her daughter promise to go back to her education later, should she get the chance. Mellor did so when her children were at school age, passing her O-levels and A-levels. She went on to Bretton Hall College and graduated with a BA Hons degree in 1983.

==Career==
As a writer, she began working for Granada Television in the 1980s, writing for the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. In 1989, Mellor also wrote many episodes for the Channel 4 soap &quot;Brookside&quot;.

She wrote for the anthology drama series &quot;Dramarama&quot; before co-creating the long-running children&#x27;s drama &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot; with her &quot;Coronation Street&quot; colleague Paul Abbott in 1988. The series was awarded Best Children&#x27;s Drama in the 1997 BAFTA Awards. She also created the soap opera &quot;Families&quot; which aired from 1990 until 1993, and wrote and starred in three series of the family show &quot;Just Us&quot; (1990–1994). She wrote the television drama serials &quot;Band of Gold&quot; (1995), &quot;Playing the Field&quot; (1998), &quot;Fat Friends&quot; (2000), &quot;Between the Sheets&quot; (2003), and &quot;Strictly Confidential&quot; (2006).

Commenting on the casting for &quot;Fat Friends&quot;, Mellor said she had wanted genuinely large people to play the parts, calling Ruth Jones and James Corden &quot;the real McCoy&quot;. Mellor had seen Corden in a Tango advert and asked her casting director Beverley Keogh to find him for her because she thought he was perfect for the part.

In a parallel career as a television actress, Mellor appeared in her own adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1997), and in other series and films such as the comedy drama &quot;Stan the Man&quot; (2002), &quot;A Good Thief&quot; (2002) and &quot;Gifted&quot; (2003). On stage, Kay acted in &quot;Three Girls in Blue&quot; and she wrote and starred in the one-woman show &quot;Queen&quot; at the West Yorkshire Playhouse.

In July 2006, Mellor&#x27;s &quot;The Chase&quot; aired on BBC One. She wrote and directed the two-part drama &quot;A Passionate Woman&quot; which was based on her 1992 stage play and was broadcast on BBC One in April 2010. The play was inspired by her parents&#x27; marriage.

In 2012, she wrote another BBC drama, &quot;The Syndicate&quot;, which ran for four series until 2021. It was set and filmed in Leeds, Bradford, Scarborough and Monaco.

In 2013 &quot;The Syndicate&quot; was remade in the United States as &quot;Lucky 7&quot;, but was cancelled after one series.

In 2014, her BBC series &quot;In the Club&quot; was first broadcast followed by a second series in 2016. Mellor&#x27;s drama series &quot;Love, Lies and Records&quot; ran on BBC One in November and December 2017, starring Rebecca Front and Ashley Jensen. Her ITV drama series &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, starring Zoë Wanamaker, Miranda Richardson and Phyllis Logan, premiered in January 2018. The fourth series of &quot;The Syndicate&quot; aired in March 2021 with a cast including Neil Morrissey, Katherine Rose Morley, Kieran Urquhart, Taj Atwal, Liberty Hobbs, Emily Head, Gaynor Faye, Kym Marsh, Katie McGlynn, Mark Benton, Lorraine Bruce, and Joe Sugg.

Mellor was awarded the BAFTA Dennis Potter Award in 1997 for Outstanding Writing for Television.

Mellor was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours and, in 2015, she was awarded the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain Award for Outstanding Contribution to Writing. In 2016, Mellor was made a Fellow of the Royal Television Society and, in February 2020, Mellor was awarded &quot;Broadcast&quot;&#x27;s Special Recognition Award.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2000 when she was surprised by Michael Aspel. She also appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 2017.

Outside of television, Mellor wrote screenplays for feature films such as &quot;Girls&#x27; Night&quot; starring Julie Walters, Brenda Blethyn and Kris Kristofferson, which played at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998. She both wrote and directed the feature film &quot;Fanny and Elvis&quot; starring Ray Winstone, which won the Audience Prize at the Dinard British Film Festival, and one off drama &quot;Some Kind of Life&quot;, which was BAFTA nominated for Best Single Drama in 1997.

In 2017, Mellor turned &quot;Fat Friends&quot; into a stage musical with Nick Lloyd Webber writing the music. &quot;Fat Friends The Musical&quot; toured the UK in 2017, and then again in 2022. Mellor subsequently adapted &quot;Band of Gold&quot; for the stage, which premiered in Mellor&#x27;s hometown of Leeds in 2019, and toured the UK until it was shut down early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life==
Mellor liked going to Roundhay Park, Golden Acre Park, and the Cottage Road Cinema in Leeds. She was also a frequent visitor and supporter of the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford.

==Death==
Mellor died on 15 May 2022 at the age of 71.

<doc id="846986" wikidata="Q164518" url="?curid=846986" title="Sirikit">
<text>Sirikit (born &quot;Mom Rajawongse&quot; Sirikit Kitiyakara; 12 August 1932) is a member of the Thai royal family who was Queen of Thailand from 28 April 1950 to 13 October 2016 as the wife of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX). She is the mother of King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X).

She met Bhumibol in Paris, where her father was Thai ambassador. They married in 1950, shortly before Bhumibol&#x27;s coronation. Sirikit was appointed queen regent in 1956, when the king entered the Buddhist monkhood for a period of time. Sirikit has four children with the king. Consort of the monarch who was, at the time the world&#x27;s longest-reigning head of state, she was also the world&#x27;s longest-serving queen consort. Sirikit suffered a stroke in 2012 and has since refrained from public appearances.

==Early life and family==
Sirikit was born on 12 August 1932, at the home of Lord Vongsanuprabhand, her maternal grandfather. She is the eldest daughter and the third child of Prince Nakkhatra Mangkala Kitiyakara, the son of Prince Kitiyakara Voralaksana, and Mom Luang Bua Snidvongs (1909–1999). Her name, which was given by Queen Rambai Barni, means &quot;the greatness of Kitiyakara&quot;.

She had three siblings, two elder brothers and a younger sister:
* Prince Kalyanakit Kitiyakara, M.D. (20 September 1929 – 15 May 1987)
* Prince Adulakit Kitiyakara (2 November 1930 – 5 May 2004)
* Princess Busba Kitiyakara (born 2 August 1934)

Sirikit was raised by her maternal grandparents for a year after her birth, since her father was in the United States to work as the secretary of the Siamese Embassy at Washington, D.C. Her mother joined her husband three months later. When she was one year old, her parents returned to Thailand. Sirikit lived together with her family in Deves Palace, near the Chao Phraya River, Bangkok.

As a child, Sirikit often visited her paternal grandmother. Once in 1933, she travelled with Princess Absornsaman Devakula following King Prajadhipok&#x27;s tour in Songkhla.

==Education==
At age four, Sirikit attended the Kindergarten College at Rajini School (sometimes called the Queen&#x27;s College), where she studied at the primary level. During that time the Pacific War was being fought. Bangkok was bombed many times, especially the rail lines, making travel unsafe. She therefore moved to Saint Francis Xavier Convent School, since it was near the palace. She studied at Saint Francis Xavier from her second primary year through the early secondary level.

In 1946, with the war now over, her father moved to the United Kingdom as the ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s, taking his family with him. Sirikit was then 13 and completed her secondary education. While in England she learned to play the piano and became fluent in English and French. Because of her father&#x27;s work as a diplomat, the family moved to other countries, including Denmark and France. While in France, she studied at a music academy in Paris.

Also in France, Sirikit met King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was related to her, since both were descendants of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). At that time, Bhumibol had ascended to the throne and was studying in Switzerland. Bhumibol and Sirikit (as well as a few other students) were staying at the Royal Thai Embassy in Paris. Sirikit accompanied the king as he visited various tourist attractions, and they found that they had much in common.

==Marriage==

On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided into the rear of a braking truck 10 km outside of Lausanne. He injured his back and incurred cuts on his face that cost him most of the sight in one eye. He subsequently wore an ocular prosthetic. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, The Princess Mother Sangwan, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that the king could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected a boarding school for her in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and the couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. The royal pair had four children, through whom they had twelve grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

===Establishment of the Queen===

The marriage took place at Srapathum Palace. Queen Sri Savarindira, the Queen Grandmother presided over the marriage ceremony. Both the king and Sirikit signed on line 11 of their certificate of marriage. As she was not yet 18, her parents also signed, on line 12 directly under her signature. She later received the Order of the Royal House of Chakri, and became queen. After the coronation ceremony on 5 May 1950, both went back to Switzerland to continue their studies, and returned to Bangkok in 1952.

===Issue===
==Regency==


When the king undertook the traditional period as a Buddhist monk in 1956, Queen Sirikit acted as regent. She performed her duties so well that she was officially named the Regent of Thailand and the King gave her the title &#x27;Somdet Phra Nang Chao Sirikit Phra Borommarachininat&#x27; on his birthday, 5 December 1956. She became the second Siamese queen regent in Thai history. The first was Queen Saovabha Phongsri of Siam, who served as regent when her husband King Chulalongkorn travelled to Europe, and later became Queen Sri Patcharindra.

==Health==
At dawn on 21 July 2012, Queen Sirikit felt unsteady and staggered while exercising at Siriraj Hospital, where King Bhumibol Adulyadej resided. After performing magnetic resonance imaging, a team of physicians determined that she had suffered an ischemic stroke.

The queen was treated and has refrained from public appearances since, including the grand audience granted by her husband on his 85th birthday from the Ananta Samakhom Hall on 5 December 2012.

On 29 November 2016, the palace announced that the queen had been discharged from the hospital and has returned to the Chitralada Royal Villa due to her recovery.

==Cultural status==
Queen Sirikit&#x27;s birthday, like the king&#x27;s, is a national holiday, and is also Mothers&#x27; Day in Thailand. She is particularly revered in the more remote and traditional parts of the country, where the monarchy is regarded as semi-divine. Her work in promoting tolerance and understanding for the Muslim minorities in the southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat have made her especially popular amongst Thai Muslims. The queen has a strong bond with southern Thailand, and she formerly spent months in the Muslim-majority provinces every year. She is considered to be one of the more quiet diplomats.

==Books and writing==

Queen Sirikit published &quot;In Memory of my European Trip&quot; in 1964, which described her time in Europe with the king. She has also composed songs for performance by The Handsome Band, the band of the palace.

<doc id="846993" wikidata="Q33871" url="?curid=846993" title="Nogai language">
<text>Nogai ( ; , , , ) also known as Noğay, Noghay, Nogay, or Nogai Tatar, is a Turkic language spoken in Southeastern European Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. It is the ancestral language of the Nogais. As a member of the Kipchak branch, it is closely related to Kazakh, Karakalpak and Crimean Tatar. In 2014 the first Nogai novel (&quot;Akşa Nenem&quot;) was published, written in the Latin alphabet.

==Classification==
Nogai is generally classified into the Kipchak–Nogai branch of Kipchak Turkic. The latter also includes Siberian Tatar in Russia, Kazakh in Kazakhstan and Karakalpak in Uzbekistan.

Three distinct dialects are recognized: 
* Karanogay or Qara-Nogai (literally &quot;Black Nogai&quot;; &quot;Northern Nogai&quot;), spoken in Dagestan and Chechnya.
* Central Nogai or Nogai Proper, in Stavropol.
* Aqnogai (White or Western Nogai), by the Kuban River, its tributaries in Karachay–Cherkessia and in the Mineralnye Vody District. Qara-Nogai and Nogai Proper are very close linguistically, whereas Aqnogai is more different. However, all three are mutually intelligible.

Outside of the southern Caucasus, other varieties exist that are either considered dialects, or distinct languages:

* Nogais in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey has Ottoman Turkish influences.
* Astrakhan Nogai, with the following three varieties:
** Karagash (also known as Kundrov Tatar)
** Yurt Tatar or Yurt Nogai
** Alabugat Tatar or Alabugat Nogai (also known as Utar)

==History==
The Nogais, descended from the peoples of the Golden Horde, take their name and that of their language from the grandson of Genghis Khan, Nogai Khan, who ruled the nomadic people west of the Danube toward the end of the 13th century. They then settled along the Black Sea coast of present-day Ukraine.

Historically, Nogai was a spoken language. When speakers wanted to write, they utilized the Kypchak or Chagatai languages, which were similar to Nogai and were written in the Perso-Arabic script. In 1928, a Latin alphabet was introduced. It was devised by the Nogai academic (Djanibek), following principles adopted for all Turkic languages.

In 1938, a transition to the Cyrillic alphabet began. The orthography based on the Latin alphabet was alleged to be an impediment to learning Russian.

The expulsion of the Nogais from Ukraine in the nineteenth century separated Nogai speakers into several geographically isolated groups. Some went to Turkey and Romania, while others stayed within the Russian Empire, settling in northern Dagestan and neighbouring areas of Chechnya and Stavropol Kray.

The Nogai language has disappeared very rapidly in Turkey. Today, it is mostly spoken by the older generation; however, there are still younger speakers, as there are some villages in Turkey where it is a common mode of communication. In the Soviet Union the language of instruction in schools was Russian, and the number of speakers declined there also. Recent estimates place the total number of Nogai speakers at about 80,000.

In 1973, two small Nogai-language newspapers were being published, one in Karachay–Cherkessia and another in the Dagestan Autonomous SSR (&quot;Ленин йолы&quot;), but most speakers never heard of these publications, and the papers did not reach Nogai villages.

Nogai is now part of the school curriculum from the 1st to the 10th year in the Nogai District of Dagestan. It is also taught at the Karachayevo-Cherkess Pedagogical School and the national branch of the Pedagogical Institute.

==Phonology==
Phonemes in parentheses indicate sounds that appear in loanwords.

==Alphabet==

There are 3 stages in the history of Nogai writing:
* before 1928 — unwritten; Kypchak and/or Chagatai was used instead with the Perso-Arabic script
* 1928—1938 — writing based on the Latin alphabet
* from 1938 — writing based on the Cyrillic alphabet

The Nogai alphabet based on Cyrillic was created in 1938. It included all of the Russian alphabet letters except Ё ё, and also the digraphs Гъ гъ, Къ къ, Нъ нъ. The digraphs Оь оь, Уь уь were added in the same year. In 1944 the digraphs Гъ гъ, Къ къ were excluded from the alphabet.

The last reform of the Nogai writing took place in 1960, when, as a result of discussions at the Karachay-Cherkessia Research Institute, Language and Literature, the letters Аь аь and Ё ё were added to it. After that, the Nogai alphabet took its present form.

<doc id="846994" wikidata="Q6562390" url="?curid=846994" title="List of Asian Jews">
<text>Jews have been present in Asia since the beginning of their history. Some examples of ancient Jewish communities in the Mediterranean and Iran (Persian Jews) and Iraq (Iraqi Jews); the Georgian Jews, Bukharian Jews, and Mountain Jews.

Through the centuries, they also established Jewish communities in eastern parts of Asia. There are some Jews who migrated to India, establishing the Bene Israel, the Baghdadi Jews and the Cochin Jews of India (Jews in India); and the former Jewish community in Kaifeng, China.

Here is a partial list of some prominent Asian Jews, arranged by country. Note that those regions of Asia where Arabic or Russian or Turkish predominate are excluded from this list (except for the Baghdadi Jews from India and Southeast Asia); see Middle Eastern Jews, Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardi Jews for information on these populations.

<text>The Air Department of the British Admiralty (later succeeded by the Air Section and the Air Division) was established prior to World War I by Winston Churchill to administer the Royal Naval Air Service.

==History==
In 1908, the British government had recognised that the use of aircraft for military and naval purposes should be explored. To this end, the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, approved the formation of an &quot;Advisory Committee for Aeronautics&quot; and an &quot;Aerial Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence&quot;. Both committees were composed of politicians, army officers and Royal Navy officers.

The Air Department was established within the Admiralty in 1910 and had the initial responsibility of building an airship. By 1911 it expanded its activities to heavier-than-air machines. In early 1912 it became jointly responsible with the Directorate of Military Aeronautics for the Royal Flying Corps, which had separate military and naval wings.

After prolonged discussion on the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Royal Flying Corps was constituted by Royal Warrant on 13 April 1912. It absorbed the nascent naval air detachment and also the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers. It consisted of two wings: a Military Wing and a Naval Wing.

In the summer of 1912, in recognition of the air branch&#x27;s expansion, Captain Murray Sueter was appointed Director of the newly formed Air Department at the Admiralty. Sueter&#x27;s remit as outlined in September 1912 stated that he was responsible to the Admiralty for &quot;all matters connected with the Naval Air Service.&quot;

The department&#x27;s function was to foster naval aviation developments and later to oversee the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). Its first director was Captain Murray Sueter. In 1915, with the growth of the Naval Air Service, the position of Director of the Air Department was abolished and replaced by that of Director of the Air Service. This new post was a flag officer appointment and the first Director was Rear-Admiral Charles Vaughan-Lee.

In July 1914 the naval wing became a separate service known as the Royal Naval Air Service, under the sole control of the Air Department. When World War I started the RNAS became responsible for co-operation with the Navy, for the bombing of all naval targets at sea and in ports.

Originally, British naval aviation came under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore. In February 1915, the RNAS was placed under the command of the Director of the Air Department (Captain Murray Sueter), although disciplinary powers over RNAS personnel were not granted to the Director. In July 1915 a further reorganization occurred when the post of Director of the Air Department was abolished and replaced with that of the Director of the Air Service (Rear-Admiral Charles Vaughan-Lee).

In January 1918 control of the (RNAS), excluding airships and balloons, were the responsibility of the Director of Naval Construction as early as 1916 and which the Admiralty retained until 1919, passed to the Air Ministry in April 1918 following re-structuring it was merged with the RFC as the Royal Air Force. The Admiralty maintained control of its aircraft carriers naval operations at sea, and naval officers however its personnel transferred to the (RAF) for training and service.

In 1920 the air department was renamed the Air Section of the Admiralty Naval Staff which in turn was renamed the Air Division in 1924.

==Directors==
&quot;The Director of the Air Department (D.A.D.) was a position in the Admiralty from 1912 to 1915 succeeded by the Director of the Air Service until 1917, The Director was responsible to the Board of Admiralty on aviation issues, and administered the Admiralty Air Department.&quot;

* Commodore Murray F. Sueter, 1912–1915.
* Rear-Admiral Charles Vaughan-Lee, 1915–1917.

==Aircraft design and production==

The Air Department produced a few of its own designs for aircraft between 1915 and but these were built by established external aircraft manufacturers

* AD Flying Boat – built by Supermarine
* AD Navyplane – built by Supermarine
* AD Scout – built by Blackburn and by Hewlett and Blondeau
* AD Seaplane Type 1000 – built by J. Samuel White

==Usage==
 literally means &quot;quiver&quot;. The name comes from the practice of early who kept ink stones inside their quivers.

Japanese writing was traditionally done using the writing set inspired from China: an inking stone, a small stick of solid ink () (which is turned to usable liquid ink by grinding on the inking stone and watering), and brushes. The complete set was easily portable and took time to prepare the materials for writing.
During the Kamakura period (1185–1333), the idea of ink-saturated cotton was developed. By touching a calligraphy brush to the cotton, one could ink the bristles with reduced risk of dripping or spilling ink. By enclosing the cotton in a little box (), a writing set was made convenient and portable.

The first were long boxes, with the ink compartment in the axis of the pen. The &quot;smoking pipe&quot; shape was designed to increase the quantity of available ink. In the late Edo period, another design was developed, with the ink box attached to the pen shaft by a chain; the ink box was used as a to fix the to the belt, while other were simply tucked behind the belt like a fan.

As only members of the samurai caste were permitted to carry katana, some were designed to be used for self-defense. Some late were made of a special alloy of gold and copper called , specifically designed to turn purple-black over time, and give the its finish.

<text>Borsetshire is a fictional county in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Archers&quot;. Its county town is the equally fictional Borchester. The county is supposedly set between Worcestershire and Warwickshire, but is also intended as a generic West Midlands rural county. Its name also echoes Anthony Trollope&#x27;s fictional Barsetshire and the real Dorsetshire.

==Geography==
Other places in the county include Ambridge, where &quot;The Archers&quot; is mainly set, Lower Loxley, a nearby village and Felpersham, a cathedral city which appears to be larger than Borchester. Ambridge is on the B3980 six miles south of Borchester and seventeen miles west of Felpersham. Ambridge lies in the valley of the River Am below Lakey Hill from which the (real-life) Malvern Hills may be seen in fine weather.

Felpersham is probably the largest settlement in the fictional county of Borsetshire. Felpersham is known to be the seat of a Church of England diocese, a university, and department stores. Unlike the county town, Borchester, Felpersham has city status. In having a cathedral but not being the county town it can perhaps be compared to Lichfield or St Albans.

The BBC map of Borsetshire shows most road numbers beginning with &quot;1&quot;, which would place it in East Anglia, although some roads begin with &quot;4&quot; (appropriate to its apparent location in the West Midlands), &quot;3&quot;, which would place it in the West Country, and even &quot;9&quot;, which would place it in north-east Scotland. Fictional rivers in the county include the River Mercer, the River Perch and the River Am. There is also a fictional Felpersham Canal. There are railway stations at Felpersham, and at Hollerton Junction (nearer to Ambridge).

==Miscellanea==
&quot;The Borchester Echo&quot; is the local newspaper published at Borchester. Radio Borsetshire is a local radio station. Borsetshire Blue is the name of a fictional cheese made by Helen Archer in the programme.

<text>15 Squadron SAAF is a squadron of the South African Air Force. It is currently a transport/utility helicopter squadron.

== History ==
The squadron was formed on 18 September 1939 as a SAAF Coastal Command squadron based at Cape Town. During the war it flew Junkers Ju-86, Bristol Blenheim and Martin Maryland aircraft. The squadron suffered a tragedy in May 1942, when eleven out of twelve personnel perished when three Blenheims encountered a sand storm and lost their bearings during a training flight and had to make an emergency landing in the desert.

The squadron flew Baltimore 5 Light Bombers in May 1945 as part of 253 Wing of the Mediterranean Allied Tactical Air Force. Notable Second World War members include Harry Schwarz, who in 1984 was made honorary colonel of the squadron.

==Post Second World War==
Aircraft flown after the war included the Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon and the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma.

The current base is AFB Durban situated at the old Durban International Airport. It operates Atlas Oryx and MBB/Kawasaki BK 117 helicopters. Their primary role is maritime and landward search and rescue. Two flights of Oryx, A and B Flights, are based in Durban and C Flight, consisting of four BK 117s is detached to AFS Port Elizabeth.

The current BK 117 aircraft of C Flight were originally inherited from the Apartheid-era &quot;homelands&quot;, the Ciskei having acquired 3 in 1983, Venda 2 in 1985, Transkei 2 in 1986 and Bophuthatswana 2 in 1987, making a total of 10 with an extra delivered from Brazil. Two of the aircraft have already been mothballed at AFB Bloemspruit. Four remain in service with 15 Squadron. C Flight&#x27;s conversion to Agusta A109LUH helicopters has been postponed due to delays in developing emergency flotation equipment for the type, thus precluding its use in a maritime environment.

<text>Alberto Cova (born 1 December 1958) is a retired Italian long-distance track athlete, winner of the 10,000 m at the 1984 Summer Olympics and 1983 World Championships.

==Biography==
Born in Inverigo, province of Como, Italy, Alberto Cova was characterized by his superiority in the sprint finish, and the only way to nullify this was to set a very fast pace from the start to finish.
Cova got his first fame at the 1982 European Championships in Athens, where he surprisingly outsprinted the main favourite Werner Schildhauer from East Germany, to win his first international championship title. In the next year, Cova wasn&#x27;t the main favourite at the first World Championships held in Helsinki, being considered only as a possible medal winner. The 10,000 m final at Helsinki was run in slow pace, with thirteen runners still in a leading pack at the bell. With only 30 metres to go, Cova was only in fifth place, but then sprinted forward to win. Schildhauer finished in second place. The top four runners sprinted to the finish line in 0.33 seconds.

The 10,000 m final at the Los Angeles Olympics began at an even slower pace than at Helsinki. At the 6 km mark, Martti Vainio from Finland, picked up the speed. Cova managed to follow him, and Vainio couldn&#x27;t sustain his own pace, so Cova swept past him after the bell and sprinted to the line to win his last international title.

At the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart, Cova was beaten at his own game, when he was outsprinted by fellow countryman Stefano Mei on the last lap of the 10,000 m final. Cova never won a major race after that, and came tenth in his heat (thereby failing to qualify for the final) at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was his last international competition.

In the 1983 World Athletics Championships 10,000-metre final, there actually were seven men in the lead group at the bell. In the 1984 Olympics 10,000-metre final, Finland&#x27;s Martti Vainio picked up the speed shortly before the 6 kilometre mark

==Achievements==
==National titles==
He won fourteen national championships at senior level.

<text>19 Squadron SAAF is a current squadron of the South African Air Force operating as a transport/utility helicopter squadron. It was formed in 1939 as part of the Air Force airways Wing, flying transport aircraft but was disbanded after a few months. It was re-formed from No. 227 Squadron RAF in 1944 and disbanded again after the end of World War II. It was again re-established in 1970 as a helicopter squadron – a role which it still performs today.

==History==
19 Squadron was formed on 1 September 1939 together with 17 Squadron. It formed part of the Airways Wing at Swartkop Air Station flying ex-South African Airways Junkers Ju 52/3m&#x27;s but was disbanded on 1 December the same year. The squadron did not participate in the Second World War until 12 August 1944 when 227 Squadron RAF was renumbered as 19 Squadron SAAF at Biferno in Italy. The squadron was deployed flying Beaufighters and was involved in operations in Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia until it was disbanded on 10 July 1945 after the end of the war.

On 1 March 1970 a Flight of 17 Squadron was transformed into 19 Squadron and equipped with SA330 Pumas at AFB Swartkop with A Flight flying from Swartkop and B Flight operating from AFB Durban for a period of time. &quot;A&quot; Flight was moved to AFB Louis Trichardt on 1 January 1991, with the rest of the squadron moving on 1 January 1992 flying Aérospatiale Alouette III&#x27;s. The squadron moved to AFB Hoedspruit on 1 January 2004 where it is currently based. 19 Squadron became the first squadron to be equipped with the Oryx helicopter in early 1994.

<text>21 Squadron SAAF is a squadron of the South African Air Force. It was formed as a bomber squadron in Kenya during World War II and became a VIP transport squadron in the 1960s, a role which it performs to this day. The squadron currently flies two Dassault Falcon 50s, two Cessna Citation IIs, a Dassault Falcon 900 and a Boeing BBJ aircraft. 21 Squadron is one of the most active squadrons in the air force with 606 VIP transport flights being made between 2009 and 2012. The Boeing BBJ is used as the presidential aircraft when the President of South Africa travels and designated callsign LMG1.

==History==
===World War II===
21 Squadron SAAF was first formed on 8 May 1941 in Nakuru, Kenya, as a bomber squadron flying Martin Maryland medium bomber aircraft. The squadron consisted of pilots from Squadrons 11, 15, and 16 of the SAAF.
From November 1943 to February 1944, the 21st Squadron was based at Totorella in the province of Foggia, Italy. Baltimore, Anson, and DC3 planes were flown on bombing raids mainly over central Italy and into Yugoslavia. On 21 February 1944 the squadron moved from Tortorella to Campomarino, south east of Termoli, where bombing continued, mainly of railways and marshalling yards. 21 Squadron SAAF was disbanded on 10 September 1945.

===VIP Squadron===
In 1968, the squadron was reformed at AFB Swartkop flying a Vickers Viscount and three Douglas Dakotas. The squadron acquired Hawker Siddeley HS-125 in 1970 and Swearingen Merlin in 1975. In 1985 the squadron moved to AFB Waterkloof. In 1983 the Viscount was transferred to 44 Squadron and the Merlins were sold in 1985. Two Beech KingAir 200Cs were acquired, but one was later sold and the other aircraft transferred to 41 Squadron. The HS-125s were disposed of in 1999. The squadron currently flies a fleet of jet aircraft. The two Dassault Falcon 50s were acquired in 1982 and 1985, the two Cessna 550 Citation IIs in 1983 and the Dassault Falcon 900 in 1992. In January 2003 the squadron received the new presidential Boeing BBJ.

The Boeing 737 BBJ is known as &quot;Inkwazi&quot;, meaning &quot;Fish eagle&quot; in the Xhosa and Zulu languages. The aircraft is based on the Boeing 737-700 and has an upgraded interior. It arrived in South Africa on 21 October 2002.

==VIP flight usage==
The following information was revealed when then Minister of Defence and Military Veterans Lindiwe Sisulu responded to a question posed by the Democratic Alliance&#x27;s Sheik Shahid Esau in Parliament.

===Number of flights made by politicians on 21 Squadron===
====Jacob Zuma====


====Kgalema Motlanthe====

====Thabo Mbeki====
====Lindiwe Sisulu====
The following information was disclosed in response to another question posed to Sisulu by Advocate L H Max of the Democratic Alliance.

All VIP flight information has since been made classified for security reasons.

===Shadow aircraft incident===
In 2012 it was found that two aircraft had followed Jacob Zuma&#x27;s Boeing BBJ flight into John F. Kennedy International Airport. The aircraft were using SAAF call signs. The aircraft were a Bombardier Global Express and a South African Airways Airbus A340. In response to the reports, then Chief of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Carlo Gagiano said that the aircraft followed to ensure that the president could make it to an important meeting after his New York visit. The Democratic Alliance said that Sisulu should take responsibility and explain why the aircraft were used.

===Acquisition of new aircraft===
In 2012 plans were announced to acquire a new Boeing 777 VIP aircraft for the SAAF in a R2 billion deal. The order was cancelled after the offer had lapsed.

In 2015, Armscor opened the tender process for a new VIP aircraft for use by the president. Analysts speculated that an aircraft meeting Armscor&#x27;s specifications could cost R4 billion.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 26 May 1971, during a practice flypast for the Republic Day celebrations (31 May), three HS-125s crashed into Devil&#x27;s Peak. All on board were killed. The accident was attributed to low visibility due to bad weather conditions.
* In 2009, the aircraft carrying Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe made an emergency landing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as it was running low on fuel. There were no injuries.
* In 2011, the aircraft carrying Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe made a precautionary landing in New Zealand due to a warning light activating, caused by a faulty sensor in the aircraft. Also in 2011, mechanical difficulties on an aircraft intended to be used by the Deputy President caused the planned official visits to Finland, Sweden and Denmark to be cancelled.

<text>22 Squadron is a squadron of the South African Air Force. It is currently a maritime helicopter squadron operating Lynx and Oryx helicopters for the South African Navy. Originally formed in 1942, the squadron is the only current maritime helicopter squadron of the SAAF. It has been involved with many rescues, some gaining international attention as well as arctic base support. 

==History==

The squadron was formed in Durban on 1 July 1942 by renaming 31 Flight to 22 (Torpedo-Bomber-Reconnaissance) Squadron. It was equipped with ex-SAA Junkers Ju 86s as well as a number of Avro Ansons, and was assigned to anti-submarine, coastal reconnaissance and convoy support duties.

It had a relatively unremarkable period of duty in World War II, being engaged mainly in coastal patrols as part of Coastal Command SAAF. In mid 1945 it was flying Lockheed Venturas from Gibraltar, under the control of AHQ Malta at Valletta, but it left for home in July. It was disbanded at Idku in Egypt on 24 October 1945. Following the war, it was briefly recreated in 1954 and equipped with Lockheed Venturas, but disbanded again soon thereafter.

The latest chapter in the squadron&#x27;s history began on 1 January 1964, when it was recreated at AFB Ysterplaat as 22 Flight and equipped with the newly delivered Westland Wasp helicopter, becoming a full squadron in May 1976. In 1978, it received a complement of Aérospatiale Alouette IIIs.

At the end of the 1980s, the Westland Wasps were withdrawn from service, but the squadron received a number of Aérospatiale Pumas in 1991 when it was amalgamated with 31 Squadron. The Pumas were later replaced with the Atlas Oryx M2.

This squadron is the sole maritime helicopter squadron of the SAAF, and therefore provides all helicopters, air and ground crew for operation aboard South African Navy vessels. It has previously been tasked with supporting South Africa&#x27;s Antarctic research station, and therefore operated two specially modified Atlas Oryx M2 helicopters, suitable for use in the extreme conditions. One of the M2s was written off after a crash landing in July 2004.

Wasp helicopters from the squadron were involved in the rescue of South African Navy personnel in the South Atlantic following the sinking of the SAS President Kruger in 1982. The squadron also gained international recognition in 2002 during the high-profile rescue of the &quot;Magdalena Oldendorff&quot; which was trapped in the Antarctic ice. 22 Squadron&#x27;s two Oryx M2s were embarked aboard the &quot;S. A. Agulhas&quot; for the successful operation.

Apart from official military support the squadron is involved in mountain rescue and air-sea rescue operations, fire fighting, crime prevention and humanitarian relief in the event of disasters.

The squadron&#x27;s Alouette IIIs were retired in August 2007. The first of four Westland Super Lynx 300 helicopters for use aboard the South African Navy&#x27;s new Valour class frigates, was delivered on 13 July 2007. It was accompanied to AFB Ysterplaat on its first flight in South Africa by two Oryx and an Alouette III.

<doc id="847024" wikidata="Q2819125" url="?curid=847024" title="AD Flying Boat">
<text>The AD Flying Boat was designed by the British Admiralty&#x27;s Air Department to serve as a patrol aircraft that could operate in conjunction with Royal Navy warships. Intended for use during the First World War, production of the aircraft was terminated as the end of the war came into sight, and the type saw little operational use. A number were repurchased after the end of the war by Supermarine Aviation and rebuilt as civil transports, becoming known as the Supermarine Channel.

==Design and development==
Designed in 1915 by the British yacht designer Linton Hope, the aircraft was of conventional biplane flying-boat configuration, and also featured a biplane tail with twin fins and rudders. The pilot and observer sat in tandem in the nose, with the engine and pusher propeller mounted behind them, between the wings. The wings could be folded forwards to facilitate shipboard stowage.

Two prototypes were constructed in 1916 by Pemberton-Billing Ltd (later to become Supermarine Aviation Works). The first prototype was intended to be powered by a 150 hp (112 kW) Sunbeam Nubian engine, but as this was not ready to use, a Hispano-Suiza 8 was substituted. The aircraft performed poorly both on the water and in the air, demonstrating severe fore and aft vibration during take-off, while subject to excessive yaw during flight. After these problems were solved by producing revised versions of the hull, and the fin and rudder, the AD Flying Boat was able to be ordered into production. A total of 80 aircraft were ordered, and 27 machines were built. Examples were tested with Sunbeam Arab and Wolseley Python engines.

==Supermarine Channel==

Following the Armistice, Supermarine purchased 19 of these AD Flying Boats to modify them for the civil market as the Supermarine Channel. The Channel I was powered with a Beardmore 160 hp engines, and the Channel II was fitted with a Armstrong Siddeley Puma engine. The reconfigured flying-boats provided accommodation for a pilot and three passengers in three open cockpits.

==Operators==
===Military operators===
*Chilean Air Force - One aircraft.
*Chilean Navy acquired one Channel with modified hull (similar to the Supermarine Seal II) in 1922.
*Imperial Japanese Navy purchased three Channels.
* Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service purchased four Beardmore engined Channels in 1920, acquiring a further ex-civil aircraft. One remained in service until 1928. 
* Royal Swedish Navy purchased a single Channel in 1921, it being destroyed during testing.
* Royal Navy
** Royal Naval Air Service operated AD Flying Boat.

===Civil operators===
* Det Norske Luftfartsrederi, Channel Mk I

<doc id="847029" wikidata="Q81135" url="?curid=847029" title="Airline transport pilot licence">
<text>The airline transport pilot license (ATPL), or in the United States of America, an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate, is the highest level of aircraft pilot certificate.

In the United States, those certified as airline transport pilots (unconditional) are authorized to act as pilot in command on scheduled air carriers&#x27; aircraft under CFR 14 Part 121. In EASA states and the United Kingdom, pilots must hold an ATPL before they can be pilot in command of a multi-pilot aircraft flown for commercial air transport operations.

== Context and privileges ==
Any pilot operating an aircraft for money must start by obtaining a commercial pilot license (CPL). This permits the pilot to carry out aerial work, such as crop spraying or banner towing.

However, in commercial air transport (CAT) operations, a CPL holder may only act as pilot in command of single-pilot aircraft or as co-pilot of multi-pilot aircraft. Commercial air transport is defined as &quot;the transport of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire&quot;. To act as pilot in command of a multi-pilot aircraft, the pilot must hold an ATPL.

Like PPLs and CPLs, ATPLs do not expire. However, a pilot must hold a valid medical certificate and the appropriate class rating, type rating and/or instrument rating for the flying they intend to do.

==Requirements==

===EASA and United Kingdom===

An applicant for an ATPL must already hold a CPL, a multi-engine instrument rating, and a multi-crew cooperation certificate. Alternatively, in EASA states and the United Kingdom, the applicant may only hold a Multi-Pilot License (MPL). ATPL holders who previously held an MPL are restricted to multi-pilot operations unless they complete a CPL skill test and other requirements.

For aeroplanes, the applicant must have 1500 hours as a pilot of airplanes, including 500 hours in multi-pilot operations on airplanes, and a minimum number of hours as pilot in command (PIC) and/or pilot in command under supervision (PICUS). There are minimum hour requirements for cross-country flight, instrument flight, and night flight. Time as pilot of helicopters, sailplanes and touring motor gliders may be partially cross-credited. For helicopters, the applicant must have 1000 hours as a pilot of helicopters, as well as other hour requirements. Time as a pilot of aeroplanes may be cross-credited up to 50%.

The applicant must pass a skill test, demonstrating their ability to perform procedures and manoeuvres, as PIC of a multi-pilot airplane under IFR. The applicant must hold a type rating for the aircraft used in the skill test. The skill test may be carried out in a suitably qualified full flight simulator.

The minimum age to gain an ATPL is 21 years, and holders must have a Class 1 medical certificate. There are separate ATPL licences for aeroplanes and helicopters.

From the age of 60-64, pilots may only act as part of a multi-pilot crew in commercial air transport operations, however they may continue to act as Pilot In Command. From the age of 65, they may no longer act as a pilot in commercial air transport operations (from age 70 for balloons and sailplanes).

==== Theoretical examination ====

The EASA ATPL requires candidates to pass 14 separate theoretical exams, with a six-month residential or twelve-month distance-learning course mandatory during this phase.

In EASA states and the United Kingdom, the 13 theoretical subjects included in the examination of ATPL applicants are:
* Air law
* Aircraft General Knowledge — Airframe/Systems/Power plant
* Instrumentation
* Mass and Balance
* Aircraft Performance
* Flight Planning and Monitoring
* Human Performance and Limitations
* Meteorology
* General navigation
* Radio navigation
* Operational Procedures
* Principles of Flight
* Communications
All exams must be passed within an 18-month period. A CPL and/or Instrument Rating must then be gained within 36 months. Provided that a CPL and IR are achieved, ATPL examination results are accepted for seven years after the most recent validity date of the IR entered in the CPL.

ATPL exams are acceptable for the issue of a CPL, so most pilots skip the CPL exams and take their ATPL exams before they obtain their CPL.

A CPL held by a pilot who has completed all ATPL theoretical exams is popularly known as a &quot;frozen ATPL&quot;, although this term has no legal significance.

===United States===

After the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, an air transport certificate became a requirement for all commercial air transport pilots. This effectively raised the number of flight hours required for new commercial pilots from 250 to 1,500. Applicants with military or university flying training can apply for a restricted airline transport pilot certificate (R-ATP) with a reduced number of hours.

To be eligible to take the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA) ATP practical test, the candidate must have at least 1,500 hours of experience in aircraft, including 250 hours as a pilot-in-command (PIC), and be at least age 23. 

An R-ATP (which allow the holder to perform only second-in-command duties) may be granted to individuals that meet one of the following criteria:
* Military pilot with 750 hours of total flight time and over 21 years old.
* Graduates with a four-year degree in aviation from an approved university with 1,000 hours of total flight time and are over 21.
* Graduates with a two-year degree in aviation with 1,250 hours of total flight time and are over 21.
* Pilots with 1,500 hours total flight time and are over 21.
The pilot can remove the restriction once they have passed 1,500 hours of total flight time and are over 23.

The FAA ATP flight test can be taken in a light piston aircraft with 1,500 hours of experience, however, the FAA additionally requires a &#x27;Type Rating&#x27; to pilot any large or jet-powered aircraft. Most FAA-certified pilots earn their ATP certificate and Type Rating (aircraft specific) simultaneously via the successful completion of a part 121 airline training program and type rating check-ride.

While pilot certificates in the United States do not expire, pilots must undergo periodic flight reviews to ensure they are safe to operate aircraft.

<text>The IF Group, also known as Grupo Iberoamericano de Fomento or Grupo Fierro, is an economic group, originated in Spain, that has investments in Spain and Latin America, mostly in the industrial and financial sectors. The Fierro Group was founded by the Spanish entrepreneur and billionaire Ildefonso Fierro, a prominent Spanish businessman. The group is worth over US$4 billion with an annual net income in excess of US$300 million. They started operations in Peru in 1961, when they installed a factory of matches, a product in which they are a world leader. In 2001 the Fierro Group in Peru was led by Manuel Isabal Roca and consisted of 18 companies, including Banco Interamericano de Finanzas (BIF), Fosforera Peruana, Tabacalera Nacional, Aval, Representaciones Alpamayo, Filtros del Perú, Destilería Peruana, Tabacalera del Sur, Industrial Cartavio, Verona Trading and Fosforera La Llama, employing around 5,000 staff between them.

Nowadays, Fierro Group in Venezuela (also known as Grupo Industrial Farallón de Venezuela: GIFVEN) has the first place of share market on match industry sales being also owners of different companies such as FOSUCA and DIFSA. Fierro Group companies had Factories such as Lander &amp; Vera and Alimentos La Giralda which produce and distribute different manufactured goods related to liquors and canned food. Its most recognized brands are Fosforos el Sol, &quot;La Giralda&quot;, &quot;Ponche Imperial&quot;, &quot;Ruskaya&quot;, Licores Lander &amp; Vera, among others.

==History==
In Ecuador, on October 24, 1958 Ignacio Fierro founded the company Fosforera Ecuatoriana S.A. (FESA).

In 1991 in Venezuela, the group owned Tabacalera Nacional (TANASA), today owned by Philip Morris, Fosforera Suramericana, C.A., Alimentos La Giralda, and Banco Exterior.

In August 2013, Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Roche Navarro retired as leader of the Grupo IF banking division. Ex-BBVA Vicente de la Parra was brought in to lead the banking division. The Banks are composed of Banco Exterior (Venezuela), Banco Internacional (Ecuador), EBNA Bank (Curaçao), Interbanco (Guatemala), and BanBif (Peru).

Other companies created include: Tabacalera Nacional S.A. (Tanasa), acquired fully by &quot;Philip Morris&quot; in 2005, Banco Internacional, Seguros Cervantes, Grafandina S.A., Industria Licorera Iberoamericana S.A. (ILSA), PetroSud (Consorcio PetroSud-PetroRiva). In 2008 the leader of the Fierro Group in Ecuador was José Enrique Fuster Camps.

==Alimentos La Giralda==

Alimentos La Giralda is a Venezuelan trading company that imports, produces and distributes foodstuffs such as capers, pickles, olives, canned fruits and canned vegetables. It is located in Caracas. The brand &quot;La Giralda&quot; was registered in 1944 by Francisco Gomez Lopez using what it used to be the emblem of the Spanish association of olive exporters.

In 1979, after buying the brand from Francisco Lopez Gomez, Enrique Moreno de la Cova and the Barceló family founded Alimentos La Giralda and Enrique became president of the company until 1983. In 1982 it was purchased by the Fierro Group. It is one of the leaders in the Venezuelan market.

<text>Borchester is a fictional town in the BBC Radio 4 radio series &quot;The Archers&quot;. It is the county town of the fictional county of Borsetshire. According to series tradition it is located 6 miles north-east of Ambridge in the Am Vale and is a historic market and wool town. These typically English country-town features are complemented by more modern additions, such as Underwoods (an upmarket department store), Jaxx bar, which was previously a café both managed by Kenton Archer, and Ambridge Organics, the shop run by Helen Archer, who also makes the Borsetshire Blue cheese sold in Underwoods.

==Location==
As &quot;The Archers&quot; is usually taken to &quot;exist&quot; in a region centred on Evesham and somewhere not too far from the Malvern Hills and the edge of the Cotswolds, Borchester could be connected to Broadway, Tewkesbury or Pershore. Hints in the series about the range of shops, local features and road layout, as well as distances sometimes given between Borchester, Felpersham and Ambridge, tend to point to Pershore as the most likely analogy, if we assume that Felpersham = Evesham. Another school of thought has Felpersham as Worcester and Borchester as Droitwich Spa. This view is supported by the existence of a Bishop of Felpersham - Evesham does not have a Bishopric whereas Worcester does. (At one time Bishop Cyril of Felpersham was an occasional character.)

Although it is a county town, it is not a city. The nearby Felpersham, which might be based on Evesham, is the seat of a Church of England diocese and does have the city status that usually goes with it. Borchester has a by-pass, built with much controversy during the 1980s. Evesham and Droitwich Spa both have by-passes but not Pershore.

The BBC published a map of Borchester in the 1990s, which, across a north-south axis common to both towns, was a &#x27;cut and paste&#x27; of Evesham west of the axis and Great Malvern to the east. A property company named Borchester Land has featured in the storyline for many years.

==Facilities==
Borchester is the location of the magistrates court for the area. Phil Archer served as a magistrate there for many years. In 1968, Nelson Gabriel, son of Walter Gabriel of Ambridge and a notorious rogue, was committed for trial and remanded in Gloucester prison at the Borchester magistrates. He returned many years later to run a wine bar in the town from 1980 to 1984. Also in Borchester is Borchester General Hospital.

Borchester is the scene of frequent shopping trips and social encounters in the series. It has a mixture of trendy, &quot;southern England&quot; features such as wine bars and upmarket delis combined with some working-class neighbourhoods. The Grundy family lived for a while in a substandard council flat in Borchester after being evicted from Grange Farm in 2000.

Borchester College, formerly Borchester Tech, is a Further education college offering both A-Level courses and vocational courses including management, hairdressing, and agricultural subjects. In 2002 it also offered evening classes in Italian. Several characters in the series have studied at Borchester College, and one, Russ Jones, taught there.

<text>Melbourne tram route 5 is a tram route on the Melbourne tramway network serving the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Operated by Yarra Trams, the route is coloured red and extends from Melbourne University to Malvern over of double track via Swanston Street, St Kilda Road, Dandenong Road and Malvern East. It is serviced out of Malvern depot utilising Z and D1 class trams.

==History==
Route 5 was allocated to the line between Malvern (Burke Road) and City (Swanston Street) on 21 November 1929, the same day that numbers were allocated to the rest of the Swanston Street trams. Trams traditionally terminated at the Victoria Street terminus, but following an accident in 1991, trams instead terminated at the Queensberry Street crossover. Due to congestion during peak hours at the crossover, some trams continued north to Melbourne University. Finally on 17 January 1996, a permanent shunt was built at Melbourne University. From then on, route 5 trams were altered run full-time to Melbourne University.

The origins of route 5 lie in separate tram lines. The section of track between Queensberry Street (Stop 4) and St Kilda Junction (Stop 30) is the oldest section of this route, dating back to the Brighton Road cable tram which opened on 11 October 1888 by the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company. This cable tram line was electrified in stages by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB). The section between Domain Interchange (Stop 20) and St Kilda Junction (Stop 30) was electrified on 27 December 1925. The section between Queensberry Street and City Road (near Stop 14) was electrified on the same day. The line between City Road and Domain Interchange was electrified on 24 January 1926. The section between St Kilda Junction and Chapel Street (Stop 32) also dates back to the cable era, as the Windsor to St Kilda Esplanade cable tramway which opened on 17 October 1891. This section was one of the first cable trams to be converted to electric traction on 27 December 1925.

The line east of Hawthorn Road (Stop 45) until the Malvern (Burke Road) terminus was one of the original lines constructed by the Prahran &amp; Malvern Tramways Trust (PMTT), which opened on 30 May 1910. The PMTT also built the section between the Sandringham railway line (near Stop 33) and Wattletree Road (Stop 40), opening on 16 December 1911. This line was extended to Chapel Street (Stop 32) on 31 March 1912.

On 24 June 1928, the MMTB constructed a small section of track between Wattletree Road and Glenferrie Road, giving a more direct route from Burke Road to St Kilda Junction.

As part of the St Kilda Junction separation works, the Wellington Street section was abandoned for a new section of track along the newly built Queens Way on 4 November 1968.

During the 2006 Commonwealth Games, the route was merged with route 55 to West Coburg at Domain Interchange to alleviate congestion along St Kilda Road.

Until 29 October 2023, the entire route only operated until 19:00, after which the route ran shuttle between Dandenong Road and Malvern. From 30 October 2023, route 5 was converted to full day operations along the entire route.

==Route==
Route 5 operates from Melbourne University travelling south through the CBD on Swanston Street via Melbourne Central station and Flinders Street stations. After crossing the Yarra River it continues south along St Kilda Road to St Kilda Junction, where it descends to Queens Way, Windsor and heads east, at Chapel Street, Queens Way becomes Dandenong Road. It continues east passing through Prahran, Armadale, Malvern and Malvern East to its terminus at Burke Road.

==Operation==
Route 5 is operated out of Malvern depot with Z and D1 class trams. It is occasionally operated by D2 class trams.

Until 29 October 2023, from 19:00 the service only operated between Dandenong Road / Wattletree Road and Malvern, with services timetabled to connect with route 64 services, displayed as Route 64/5.

Since 30 October 2023, the evening operations swapped with route 64, with route 5 running low-floor trams along the entire route throughout the evening, and route 64 running shuttle between Dandenong Road / Wattle Tree Road and East Brighton after 18:30.

<doc id="847043" wikidata="Q5578510" url="?curid=847043" title="Gold-plating (EU law)">
<text>Gold-plating is a term used to characterise the process whereby the powers of an EU directive are extended when being transposed into the national laws of a member state.

In an operational study relating to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Commission treats gold-plating as a source of interference with policy outcomes, defining gold-plating as &quot;an excess of norms, guidelines and procedures accumulated at national, regional and local levels, which interfere with the expected policy goals to be achieved by such regulation&quot;. Business lobbyists generally argue against gold-plating, because additional regulation tends to raise costs for businesses, but there are a few companies who stand to benefit from it.

In case of gold-plating, the European Court of Justice does in fact have jurisdiction to interpret EU law, even if the case at hand is not directly governed by EU law.

==Examples==
The UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills gave the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 as an example of gold-plated EU legislation, because it had granted temporary workers the right to performance-related bonuses, something that was not in the original EU law, which dealt with &quot;the right to the same pay as permanent staff&quot;.

In Italy, gold-plating has often been used as a device to pass through controversial measures and to ensure a lower degree of parliamentary scrutiny, particularly in periods of weak government.
==Reform==
EU governments committed themselves to a deregulation agenda at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, and as a consequence, the European Commission has supported more maximum harmonisation measures in recent years, which effectively prohibit gold-plating.

Within the UK, the 2010 coalition agreement included a pledge to end gold-plating; the original policy guidelines were finalised in June 2011. Specifically, they stipulate that all EU legislation be reviewed every five years by &quot;all departments...to ensure that they are only implementing the absolute minimum regulation necessary to comply&quot;. The principle of copying out the text of European directives directly into UK law was adopted in 2010, along with avoiding transposition into UK law earlier than the date specified in the relevant directive, unless there were &quot;compelling reasons&quot; for earlier implementation. Previously, a 2006 review of gold-plating by Lord Davidson QC found that some EU laws had indeed been &quot;over-implemented&quot;, but Lord Davidson had cautioned against &quot;copying out the text of a directive&quot;.

<text>Open Platform Communications (OPC) is a series of standards and specifications for industrial telecommunication. They are based on Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for process control.
An industrial automation task force developed the original standard in 1996 under the name OLE for Process Control. OPC specifies the communication of real-time plant data between control devices from different manufacturers.

After the initial release in 1996, the OPC Foundation was created to maintain the standards. Since OPC has been adopted beyond the field of process control, the OPC Foundation changed its name to Open Platform Communications in 2011. The name change reflects the applications of OPC technology for applications in building automation, discrete manufacturing, process control and others. OPC has also grown beyond its original OLE implementation to include other data transportation technologies including Microsoft Corporation&#x27;s .NET Framework, XML, and even the OPC Foundation&#x27;s binary-encoded TCP format.

==History== 
The OPC specification was based on the OLE, COM, and DCOM technologies developed by Microsoft Corporation for the Microsoft Windows operating system family. The specification defined a standard set of objects, interfaces e.g. IDL and methods for use in process control and manufacturing automation applications to facilitate interoperability. The most common OPC specification is OPC Data Access, which is used for reading and writing real-time data. When vendors refer to &quot;OPC&quot; generically, they typically mean OPC Data Access (OPC DA). OPC DA itself has gone through three major revisions since its inception. Versions are backwards compatible, in that a version 3 OPC Server can still be accessed by a version 1 OPC Client, since the specifications add functionality, but still require the older version to be implemented as well. However, a client could be written that does not support the older functions since everything can be done using the newer ones, thus a DA-3-compatible client will not necessarily work with a DA 1.0 Server.

In addition OPC DA specification, the OPC Foundation maintains the OPC Historical Data Access (HDA) specification. In contrast to the real time data that is accessible with OPC DA, OPC HDA allows access and retrieval of archived data.

The OPC Alarms and Events specification is maintained by the OPC Foundation, and defines the exchange of alarm and event type message information, as well as variable states and state management.
By 2002, the specification was compared to Fieldbus and other previous standards.

An OPC Express Interface, known as OPC Xi, was approved in November, 2009, for the .NET Framework. OPC Xi used Windows Communication Foundation instead of DCOM, so it can be configured for communication across the enhanced security of network address translation (NAT).

About the same time, the OPC Unified Architecture (UA) was developed for platform independence. UA can be implemented with Java, Microsoft .NET, or C, eliminating the need to use a Microsoft Windows platform of earlier OPC versions. UA combined the functionality of the existing OPC interfaces with new technologies such as XML and Web services to deliver higher level manufacturing execution system (MES) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) support. The first working group for UA met in 2003, version 1.0 was published in 2006.

On September 16, 2010, The OPC Foundation and the MTConnect Institute announced cooperation to ensure interoperability and consistency between the two standards.

==Design==
OPC was designed to provide a common bridge for Windows-based software applications and process control hardware. Standards define consistent methods of accessing field data from plant floor devices. This method remains the same regardless of the type and source of data. An OPC Server for one hardware device provides the same methods for an OPC client to access its data as any other OPC Server for any hardware device. The aim was to reduce the amount of duplicated effort required from hardware manufacturers and their software partners, and from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and other human-machine interface (HMI) producers in order to interface the two. Once a hardware manufacturer had developed their OPC Server for the new hardware device, their work was done with regards to allowing any &#x27;top end&#x27; to access their device, and once the SCADA producer had developed their OPC client, it allowed access to any hardware with an OPC compliant server.

OPC servers provide a method for different software packages (as long as it is an OPC client) to access data from a process control device, such as a programmable logic controller (PLC) or distributed control system (DCS). Traditionally, any time a package needed access to data from a device, a custom interface or driver had to be written. 
There is nothing in the OPC specifications to restrict the server to providing access to a process control device. OPC Servers can be written for anything from getting the internal temperature of a microprocessor to the current temperature in Monument Valley.

Once an OPC Server is written for a particular device, it can be reused by any application that is able to act as an OPC client. OPC servers can be linked and communicate to other servers. OPC servers use Microsoft&#x27;s OLE technology (also known as the Component Object Model, or COM) to communicate with clients. COM technology permits a standard for real-time information exchange between software applications and process hardware to be defined.

Some OPC specifications are published, but others are available only to members of the OPC Foundation. So while no company &quot;owns&quot; OPC and anyone can develop an OPC server whether or not they are a member of the OPC Foundation, non-members will not necessarily be using the latest specifications. It is up to each company that requires OPC products to ensure that their products are certified and that their system integrators have the necessary training.
