<text>Figueira da Foz (), also known as Figueira for short, is a city and a municipality in the Coimbra District, in Portugal. Practically at the midpoint of the Iberian Peninsula&#x27;s Atlantic coast, it is located at the mouth of the Mondego River, west of Coimbra and sheltered by hills (Serra da Boa Viagem), sharing about the same latitude with Philadelphia, Baku and Beijing. The population of the municipality in 2011 was 62,125, in an area of . The city of Figueira da Foz proper has a population of 46,600. It is the second largest city in the district of Coimbra.

It is a coastal city with several beaches, summer and seaport facilities on the Atlantic Ocean coast. As a tourism city, it plays an important part in the centre of the country. A zone of legal gambling, one can find in Figueira one of the biggest casinos of the Iberian Peninsula – the Casino Figueira.

==History==
According to the legend, the place&#x27;s name is due to a fig tree, which stood at the quay of Salmanha, where the fishermen used to tie up their boats. Foz means &quot;place of discharge&quot;, often used at the point a river meets another body of water, specially where there is a clear energy or water flow clash. Some historical traces show that people were settling in this region since the Neolithic age. The oldest known document, however, dates from the year 1096. In this, an abbot named Pedro donates estates, which belonged to the church of S. Julião, to the cathedral Sé Velha of Coimbra.

Knowing the great importance rivers had in the development of cities and of ancient civilizations, the mouth of the Mondego must have played a central role in the fixation of men in this region and for the formation of settlements, which were the beginning of the city of Figueira da Foz. Figueira da Foz had a huge development during the 18th and 19th centuries due to the immense port movements and the expansion of the shipbuilding and cod drying industry, supplying the city with new communication routes, housing and other facilities. It was elevated to &quot;vila&quot; (small town) on 12 March 1771 and turned city (&quot;cidade&quot;) on 20 September 1882. Discovered as a sea resort by the end of the 19th century, it gained a great reputation in the 1920s and 1930s. The city had the Portuguese nickname of &quot;Rainha das Praias&quot; (Queen of the Beaches).

The municipality has some noted landmarks like the Sotto Mayor Palace, the old fishing village of Buarcos, the Serra da Boa Viagem – a small forested mountain by the Atlantic Ocean, several beaches, and its large seaside promenade paved with typical Portuguese pavement. Figueira da Foz has several Churches, many of them in the rich Baroque style, a Municipal Museum with the archaeological, ethnographic and artistic collection, the Santa Catarina Fort and the old Buarcos Fortress, the &quot;Relógio Tower&quot; by the main sandy beach, several archaeological vestiges throughout the municipality, several Palaces and Manor Houses (like the Sotto Mayor Palace), as well as several green spaces and small gardens like those in the area of &quot;Abadias&quot;.

==Economy==
The city is an important industrial centre, producing wood pulp and paper (Navigator, formerly and still commonly known as Soporcel, and Celbi, part of Altri) and glass (Verallia, part of Saint-Gobain). It also has notable naval construction and fish industries. Until the turn of the 21st century, a factory of the CIMPOR Group was installed in the Mondego Cape &quot;(Cabo Mondego)&quot;. The seaport and the fishing harbour are also important for its economy.

With its old and renowned casino (&quot;Casino da Figueira&quot;), the marina, several hotels, restaurants and other tourist facilities, Figueira is actually a very important Atlantic beach resort, in the center of Portugal&#x27;s Silver Coast/&quot;Costa de Prata&quot; tourism region. A generally windy coastal area, its relatively cold seawaters are particularly renowned as a surf and kitesurf hotspot in the same fashion as other places throughout the west coast of Portugal, such as Nazaré, Peniche or Ericeira. In July and August, its main beaches are usually packed with beachgoers too.

==Education==
The city has well-equipped kindergartens, schools and high schools. It had two private universities: the Catholic University of Portugal (Figueira da Foz branch) and the Internacional University (Figueira da Foz branch) but they were closed in 2009 due to lack of funds and academic integrity. The municipality of Figueira da Foz is served by the ancient University of Coimbra and the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra located 40 kilometers to the east of the city, in the district capital Coimbra.

==Parishes==
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 14 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):

* Alhadas
* Alqueidão
* Bom Sucesso
* Buarcos
* Ferreira-a-Nova
* Lavos
* Maiorca
* Marinha das Ondas
* Moinhos da Gândara
* Paião
* Quiaios

* Tavarede
* Vila Verde 
==Demographics==

==Geography==
Figueira is about 40 kilometers west of Coimbra by the Atlantic Ocean and less than 200 kilometers to the north of Lisbon, on the mouth of the Mondego River and at the foothills of the Serra da Boa Viagem (mountain). The Cabo Mondego (cape) is inserted in the context of the Lusitanian Basin and is located on the western edge of the Serra da Boa Viagem (latitude 40º 11´ 3´´ N, longitude 08º 54´34´´W), approximately 6 km to the northwest of the city of Figueira da Foz proper. Classified as a Natural Monument since 2007, the cape is one of the most important testimonies for understanding the geological history of Portugal; represents, in a particularly complete way, some of the most important episodes in the history of the Earth that occurred during the Jurassic, for a time interval that is, approximately, between 185 and 140 million years, which justifies, at international level, the relevance of its classification, conservation and dissemination. The outcrop comprises a series of marine and fluvial-lake sediments that extend from the Upper Toarciano to the Titonian. This record, on some levels, is particularly continuous and rich in paleontological, sedimentological and paleomagnetic information, which are associated with exceptional observation conditions. It includes levels with the oldest footprints of megalosaurs (bipedal and carnivorous dinosaurs) described in Portugal and whose first reference dates from 1884.

==Climate==
Figueira da Foz has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) characterized by mild, rainy winters and dry, warm summers. The annual average temperature is around and the annual average rainfall is about . The sea surface temperature varies from in January and February to in August and September. On summer afternoons moderate to (occasionally) strong north-westerly winds are common. Subtropical Storm Alpha, notable for being the only tropical or subtropical cyclone to make landfall in Portugal on record, made landfall at peak intensity in the general vicinity of the city on 18 September 2020. Figueira da Foz was, however, particularly hit hard when Storm (Hurricane) Leslie made landfall in mainland Europe right within the city on 13 October 2018.

<text>The Concord River is a tributary of the Merrimack River in eastern Massachusetts, United States. The river drains a small rural, suburban region northwest of Boston. As one of the most notable small rivers in U.S. history, it was the scene of an important early battle of the American Revolutionary War and was the subject of a 19th-century book by Henry David Thoreau.

==Description and early history==
The river begins in Middlesex County, formed by the confluence of the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers at Egg Rock, near the Concord town center. It flows generally north, from eastern Concord (along the northwestern edge of the Boston metropolitan area), joining the Merrimack River from the south on the eastern side of Lowell. It is a gently flowing stream with little variation in topography along most of its route. Its drainage basin stretches into Worcester County and includes 36 towns within Massachusetts.

Native Americans called it the &quot;Musketaquid&quot; or &quot;grass-grown&quot; river because its sluggish waters abound in aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation and its banks are fringed with wild grasses and sedges which stretch for miles along both sides of this placid stream. This creates an ideal environment for a variety of fish, including bass, shad, alewife (river herring), pickerel, carp and American eel. Native Americans wove sticks in intricate designs to trap alewives and other migrating fish at the mouths of rivers throughout this region. 

By 1635, settlers from England began to arrive, giving the river its current name. On April 19, 1775, the Old North Bridge over the river in the town of Concord was the scene of the famous Battle of Concord (occurring on the same day when the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired at nearby Lexington). The current version of the bridge (a reproduction) is preserved by the National Park Service.

Henry David Thoreau wrote his first book, &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot;, in 1849 while living at nearby Walden Pond. His book recounted a seven-day boat trip on the rivers with his brother John, who had since died. Thoreau recounted his exploration of the natural beauty of the river, and his accompanying thoughts on such eternal themes as truth, poetry, travel and friendship. Despite the development of suburbs near the river, it remains a popular canoeing destination today. The last mile of the river in Lowell is serious class 3+/4 whitewater.

==Dams cause fish population to decrease==
Dams were built along the Concord River to increase crop production and also to provide a source of power for operating mills. As a result, by the 19th century, the native fish populations of shad and alewife became extinct because the dams prevented the mature fish from returning upstream to spawn. Alewife and other anadromous fish are migratory. They hatch in freshwater, make their way to the sea to mature, then return as adults to freshwater to spawn, usually near where they had hatched. This instinct is imprinted within the fish when it is born. When the route upstream became blocked, this cycle was broken and the fish were unable to survive without it. The Faulkner Dam in North Billerica is just one of many blockages that caused the alewife population to collapse on the Concord River. Water was later diverted north to Lowell and south to Charlestown to run the Middlesex Canal.

==Effects of pollution==
During the 19th century, the Concord River was a hub of industrial activity during the US Industrial Revolution. This led to environmental challenges as industrial wastes, untreated sewage, and other organic waste were dumped into the river. Industrial development peaked in the 1920s, contributing to the pollution of the river. By the 1960s, the Merrimack River into which the Concord River empties, was considered one of the top 10 most polluted waterways in America.

Following the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the United States initiated efforts to enhance the quality of America&#x27;s water bodies. This legislation imposed more stringent regulations on point source discharges into rivers and other navigable waters. As a result, three wastewater treatment plants were constructed along the banks of the Concord River: one in Concord and two in Billerica. These facilities played a crucial role in preventing further degradation of the river ecosystem by operating within federally mandated limits.

Pollutants such as heavy metals and PCBs continue to be trapped in the sediment of the Sudbury River and downstream into the Concord River. As a result, fish consumption is prohibited in such areas, due to the presence of mercury-laden sediment originating from the Nyanza Superfund site and other sources.

In August 2004, perchlorate was detected in the Concord River. Initially, it was believed that explosives used in nearby road and building construction may have caused this contamination. However, an investigation by the town of Billerica eventually determined that the source was a local company that produced surgical and medical materials. The company had been using 220 gallons of perchloric acid per month in a bleaching process, with the rinse water being discharged into the sewage system. Following this investigation, the company voluntarily ceased operations until it could install ion exchange equipment to comply with environmental regulations.

In May 2007, Billerica faced legal action and was fined $250,000 for releasing pollutants into the Concord River. This action was taken by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) due to the town exceeding allowable effluent limits for phosphorus, fecal coliform bacteria, pH, and ammonia nitrogen. Additionally, the town was charged with failing to submit discharge monitoring reports, complying with monitoring requirements, and failing to submit infiltration and inflow reporting. The EPA stated that Billerica&#x27;s phosphorus discharges resulted in an excess of nutrients released in the river, leading to harmful excessive growth of aquatic plants.

==Diadromous fish recovery effort==
In May 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Massachusetts Riverways Program, and volunteers from the Sudbury Valley Trustees (SVT) released 7,000 adult alewives into the Concord River. They were transferred from the Nemasket River so that they could lay their eggs and spawn upstream. This imprinted the young alewives with the Concord as their new home river. The experiment did not succeed, as too few fish returned to the base of the first dam on the Concord River. A feasibility study published in 2016 is again exploring steps necessary for returning diadromous fish to the Concord River, and farther upstream, to the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers.

<text>The Auckland Island merganser (Mergus australis) (), also known as the New Zealand merganser, was a typical merganser that is now extinct.

==Description==
This duck was similar in size to the red-breasted merganser (&quot;Mergus serrator&quot;). The adult male had a dark reddish-brown head, crest and neck, with bluish black mantle and tail and slate grey wings. The female was slightly smaller with a shorter crest.

==History==
The Auckland Island merganser was known from the Auckland Islands archipelago, part of the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands. The only historical records are from Auckland Island and Adams Island. Holocene bones were found on Enderby Island. The last specimens were apparently a pair shot on 9 January 1902, and the species is now extinct. It was not found in a 1909 search, and a thorough 1972/1973 exploration of possible habitat concluded that it was long extinct. Its decline was caused by a combination of hunting and predation by introduced mammals. 

The closely related Chatham Island merganser (&quot;Mergus milleneri&quot;) is known from Holocene bones found on Chatham Island, New Zealand. The species identity of merganser bones from mainland New Zealand - North, South, and Stewart Islands - is unresolved.

<doc id="861523" wikidata="Q6031407" url="?curid=861523" title="InfraGard">
<text>InfraGard is a national non-profit organization serving as a public-private partnership between U.S. businesses and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The organization is an information sharing and analysis effort serving the interests, and combining the knowledge base of, a wide range of private sector and government members. InfraGard is an association of individuals that facilitates information sharing and intelligence between businesses, academic institutions, state and local law enforcement agencies, and other participants dedicated to preventing hostile acts against the United States.

==History==
InfraGard began in the Cleveland, Ohio, Field Office in 1996, and has since expanded to become a national-level program, with InfraGard coordinators in every FBI field office. Originally, it was a local effort to gain support from the information technology industry and academia for the FBI&#x27;s investigative efforts in the cyber arena, but it has since expanded to a much wider range of activities surrounding the nation&#x27;s critical infrastructure.

The program expanded to other FBI Field Offices, and in 1998 the FBI assigned national program responsibility for InfraGard to the former National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) directed by RADM James B. Plehal and to the FBI&#x27;s Cyber Division in 2003. Since 2003, InfraGard Alliances and the FBI said that they have developed a TRUST-based public-private sector partnership to ensure reliability and integrity of information exchanged about various terrorism, intelligence, criminal, and security matters. It supports FBI priorities in the areas of counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence, and cybercrime.

==Information sharing==
InfraGard chapters participate to assure that the critical infrastructure owners and operators—estimated at 85% private sector—are engaged and represented in local and regional planning efforts. Working on all 16 critical infrastructure sectors, the organization provides resources and information not only on prevention, but also on building resilience and response capabilities.

==Training==
InfraGard chapters around the nation also provide cyber and physical security training sessions that focus on the latest threats as identified by the FBI. Sessions include threat briefings, technical sessions on cyber and physical attack vectors, response training, and other resources to help CISOs and CSOs protect their enterprise. InfraGard approaches threats to critical infrastructure from both a tactical and strategic level, addressing the needs of those on the front lines of security as well as those decision makers tasked with assessing their enterprise&#x27;s vulnerabilities and allocating resources to protect it.

The information sharing between the organization and government has been criticized by those protecting civil liberties, concerned the membership would be surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI. The group has also been the subject of hacking attacks intended to embarrass the FBI. Local chapters regularly meet to discuss the latest threats or listen to talks from subject matter experts on security issues, with membership open to U.S. citizens at no cost. As of July 2012, the organization reported membership at over 54,677 (including FBI).

== Civil liberties ==
Partnership between government agencies and private organizations has its critics. Concerned about civil liberties, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned that there &quot;is evidence that InfraGard may be closer to a corporate TIPS program, turning private-sector corporations — some of which may be in a position to observe the activities of millions of individual customers — into surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI&quot;. Concluding that &quot;any program that institutionalizes close, secretive ties between such organizations raises serious questions about the scope of its activities, now and in the future.&quot; While others describing Infragard state &quot;the architecture of the Internet—and the many possible methods of attack— requires governments, corporations, and private parties to work together to protect network security and head off threats before they occur.&quot; Responding to the ACLU criticism, Chairwoman Kathleen Kiernan of the InfraGard National Members Alliance (INMA) denies that InfraGard is anything but beneficial to all Americans stating &quot;It&#x27;s not an elitist group in any way, shape or form,&quot; she says. &quot;We&#x27;re out there trying to protect everybody. Any U.S. citizen on the planet is eligible to apply to InfraGard.&quot;

==LulzSec attacks==
In 2011, LulzSec claimed responsibility for attacking chapter websites managed by local members in Connecticut and Atlanta, in order to embarrass the FBI with &quot;simple hacks&quot;. The group leaked some of InfraGard member e-mails and a database of local users. The group defaced the website posting the following message, &quot;LET IT FLOW YOU STUPID FBI BATTLESHIPS&quot;, accompanied with a video. LulzSec has posted the following message regarding the attack:

== 2022 breach ==
On December 10, 2022, a member of BreachForums identified by the screen name &quot;USDoD&quot; posted a thread offering the sale, for $50,000, of a database containing the information of over 80,000 members of InfraGard. The individual claimed to have obtained access to the portal through a social engineering attack in which they pretended to be the CEO of an unknown U.S. financial corporation, applying for InfraGard membership to both Infraguard members and the FBI who later granted the hacker InfraGard membership and access to the InfraGard portal. Once granted access the hacker, used a script to obtain the InfraGard database information. 

The FBI has not commented on the hack but was aware of the false account in the InfraGard portal. The hack occurred roughly one year after the 2021 FBI email hack.

On 24 March 2023, the United States Department of Justice announced the arrest of Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, the alleged administrator of BreachForums, by the FBI. Fitzpatrick was initially charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud. After the execution of a search warrant, he was additionally charged with possession of child pornography. Fitzpatrick was freed on a $300,000 bond, but was subsequently re-arrested on 2 January 2024 after allegedly violating the conditions of his bail. On 16 January 2024, Fitzpatrick pled guilty to conspiracy to commit access device fraud, solicitation for the purpose of offering access devices and possession of child pornography. He was sentenced by a federal judge to 20 years of supervised release and is required to register as a sex offender. 

In May 2024, working in-conjunction with domestic and international law enforcement partners, the Department of Justice seized the BreachForums website.

<doc id="861530" wikidata="Q808592" url="?curid=861530" title="Barometric formula">
<text>The barometric formula is a formula used to model how the air pressure (or air density) changes with altitude.

== Pressure equations ==
There are two equations for computing pressure as a function of height. The first equation is applicable to the atmospheric layers in which the temperature is assumed to vary with altitude at a non null lapse rate of formula_1:

formula_2
The second equation is applicable to the atmospheric layers in which the temperature is assumed not to vary with altitude (lapse rate is null):

formula_3
where:
*formula_4 = reference pressure 
*formula_5 = reference temperature (K)
*formula_6 = temperature lapse rate (K/m) in ISA
*formula_7 = geopotential height at which pressure is calculated (m) 
*formula_8 = geopotential height of reference level &quot;b&quot; (meters; e.g., &quot;hb&quot; = 11 000 m)
*formula_9 = universal gas constant: 8.3144598 J/(mol·K)
*formula_10 = gravitational acceleration: 9.80665 m/s2
*formula_11 = molar mass of Earth&#x27;s air: 0.0289644 kg/mol

Or converted to imperial units:

*formula_4 = reference pressure 
*formula_5 = reference temperature (K)
*formula_6 = temperature lapse rate (K/ft) in ISA
*formula_7 = height at which pressure is calculated (ft)
*formula_8 = height of reference level &quot;b&quot; (feet; e.g., &quot;hb&quot; = 36,089 ft)
*formula_9 = universal gas constant; using feet, kelvins, and (SI) moles: 
*formula_10 = gravitational acceleration: 32.17405 ft/s2
*formula_11 = molar mass of Earth&#x27;s air: 28.9644 lb/lb-mol

The value of subscript &quot;b&quot; ranges from 0 to 6 in accordance with each of seven successive layers of the atmosphere shown in the table below. In these equations, &quot;g&quot;0, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;R&quot;* are each single-valued constants, while &quot;P&quot;, &quot;L,&quot; &quot;T,&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are multivalued constants in accordance with the table below. The values used for &quot;M&quot;, &quot;g&quot;0, and &quot;R&quot;* are in accordance with the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976, and the value for &quot;R&quot;* in particular does not agree with standard values for this constant. The reference value for &quot;Pb&quot; for &quot;b&quot; = 0 is the defined sea level value, &quot;P&quot;0 = 101 325 Pa or 29.92126 inHg. Values of &quot;Pb&quot; of &quot;b&quot; = 1 through &quot;b&quot; = 6 are obtained from the application of the appropriate member of the pair equations 1 and 2 for the case when &quot;h&quot; = &quot;h&quot;&quot;b&quot;+1.

==Density equations==
The expressions for calculating density are nearly identical to calculating pressure. The only difference is the exponent in Equation 1.

There are two equations for computing density as a function of height. The first equation is applicable to the standard model of the troposphere in which the temperature is assumed to vary with altitude at a lapse rate of formula_1; the second equation is applicable to the standard model of the stratosphere in which the temperature is assumed not to vary with altitude.

Equation 1:
formula_21

which is equivalent to the ratio of the relative pressure and temperature changes

formula_22

Equation 2:
formula_23

where
*formula_24 = mass density (kg/m3)
*formula_25 = standard temperature (K)
*formula_26 = standard temperature lapse rate (see table below) (K/m) in ISA
*formula_7 = height above sea level (geopotential meters)
*formula_9 = universal gas constant 8.3144598 N·m/(mol·K)
*formula_10 = gravitational acceleration: 9.80665 m/s2
*formula_11 = molar mass of Earth&#x27;s air: 0.0289644 kg/mol

or, converted to U.S. gravitational foot-pound-second units (no longer used in U.K.):
*formula_24 = mass density (slug/ft3)
*formula_32 = standard temperature (K)
*formula_33 = standard temperature lapse rate (K/ft)
*formula_34 = height above sea level (geopotential feet)
*formula_35 = universal gas constant: 8.9494596×104 ft2/(s·K)
*formula_36 = gravitational acceleration: 32.17405 ft/s2
*formula_37 = molar mass of Earth&#x27;s air: 0.0289644 kg/mol

The value of subscript &quot;b&quot; ranges from 0 to 6 in accordance with each of seven successive layers of the atmosphere shown in the table below. The reference value for &quot;ρb&quot; for &quot;b&quot; = 0 is the defined sea level value, &quot;ρ&quot;0 = 1.2250 kg/m3 or 0.0023768908 slug/ft3. Values of &quot;ρb&quot; of &quot;b&quot; = 1 through &quot;b&quot; = 6 are obtained from the application of the appropriate member of the pair equations 1 and 2 for the case when &quot;h&quot; = &quot;h&quot;&quot;b&quot;+1.

In these equations, &quot;g&quot;0, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;R&quot;* are each single-valued constants, while &quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;T&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are multi-valued constants in accordance with the table below. The values used for &quot;M&quot;, &quot;g&quot;0 and &quot;R&quot;* are in accordance with the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976, and that the value for &quot;R&quot;* in particular does not agree with standard values for this constant.

==Derivation==
The barometric formula can be derived using the ideal gas law:
formula_38

Assuming that all pressure is hydrostatic:
formula_39
and dividing this equation by formula_40 we get:
formula_41

Integrating this expression from the surface to the altitude &quot;z&quot; we get:
formula_42

Assuming linear temperature change formula_43 and constant molar mass and gravitational acceleration, we get the first barometric formula:
formula_44

Instead, assuming constant temperature, integrating gives the second barometric formula:
formula_45

In this formulation, &quot;R*&quot; is the gas constant, and the term &quot;R*T&quot;/&quot;Mg&quot; gives the scale height (approximately equal to 8.4 km for the troposphere).

(For exact results, it should be remembered that atmospheres containing water do not behave as an &quot;ideal gas&quot;. See real gas or perfect gas or gas for further understanding.)

<text>Lorcan Cranitch (born 28 August 1959) is an Irish actor.

Born in Dublin, Lorcan Cranitch became involved in drama while a student. In 1980 he moved to London, where he trained at RADA.

==Career==
His first major role on British television was as Tim Healy in the 1991 BBC drama series &quot;Parnell and the Englishwoman&quot;. It was as the troubled DS Jimmy Beck in &quot;Cracker&quot; (1993-1995) that he became a familiar face to viewers.

Following &quot;Cracker&quot; he returned to the BBC in a part specially written for him, as Sean Dillon in &quot;Ballykissangel&quot;. In 2001 he starred in the short-lived drama series &quot;McCready and Daughter&quot;, taking on a role originally intended for his former &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; co-star, Tony Doyle, who died shortly before the series was due to be filmed. He appeared in several other British television dramas, including &quot;Deacon Brodie&quot; (with Billy Connolly), &quot;Shackleton&quot; (as Frank Wild) with Kenneth Branagh, &quot;Omagh&quot;, &quot;Hornblower&quot; (with Ioan Gruffudd), &quot;The Street&quot;, &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, &quot;Spooks&quot;, &quot;Silent Witness&quot; and &quot;New Tricks&quot;. In 2005 he took a villainous role in the HBO/BBC production of &quot;Rome&quot;, as the underworld baron Erastes Fulmen. In the 2009 BBC drama &quot;Best: His Mother&#x27;s Son&quot;, he played Dickie Best, the father of footballer George Best. He also appeared in &quot;The Bill&quot; playing DCI Frank Keane.

Lorcan briefly appeared as DI Littlejohn in the Sky Atlantic series &quot;Fortitude&quot;.

On film he has appeared in &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; with Meryl Streep, &quot;The Playboys&quot; and &quot;Titanic Town&quot;.

He played Melvin in &quot;New Tricks&quot; &quot;Communal Living&quot; (S5:E7), 2008. In 2011 he appeared as Liam Cullen in “The Gift of Promise”, (S5:E4) of &quot;Lewis&quot;. He appeared in the BBC series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; (S5:E7), 2016. In 2017 he played Assistant Chief Constable Nicholls in the first part of the final series of the BBC drama &quot;Inspector George Gently&quot;, (S8.E1)

He has combined this with stage work with The Royal National Theatre, The Royal Shakespeare Company, Donmar West End, The Abbey and The Gate Theatre in Dublin.

In February 2021, Cranitch took a lead role as Detective Chief Superintendent Jackie Twomey in the BBC crime drama series &quot;Bloodlands&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cranitch attended secondary school at Terenure College. Cranitch was married to Susan Jackson, a journalist and newsreader with RTÉ. They adopted an Ethiopian child in 2010. The couple separated in 2016. His sister, Ellen Cranitch, is a regular presenter on Lyric FM, RTÊ&#x27;s classical music station.

<text>The 2.2 and 2.5, also known as the Trenton Engine due to their manufacturing location, are a family of overhead cam inline-4 engines developed by Chrysler Corporation originally for the Chrysler K- and L-platforms cars and subsequently used in many other Chrysler vehicles. After its launch in 1981, it became the basis for all Chrysler-developed 4-cylinder engines until the Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 &amp; 2.4 engine family was released in 1994. It was the first Chrysler-engineered four-cylinder engine since the Chrysler flathead four-cylinder was discontinued in 1933. The engine block and valvetrain were not derived from the overhead valve Chrysler LA series V8 that was in production then.

==2.2==
The first version of this engine family was a normally aspirated unit. Developed under the leadership of Chief Engineer – Engine Design and Development Willem Weertman and head of performance tuning Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Hagenbuch, who had worked on most of Chrysler&#x27;s V-8 engines and the Chrysler Slant-6 engine, it was introduced in the 1981 Dodge Aries, Dodge Omni, Plymouth Horizon and Plymouth Reliant, and was produced until 2000.

The 2.2 has an undersquare bore and stroke, which gives it a displacement of . It is a &quot;siamesed&quot; engine: there are no coolant passages between cylinders. The bore spacing is , limiting the potential for increased bore diameter. All 2.2 engines have cast iron blocks, use a timing belt, and are non-interference engines. The earliest version used a two-barrel carburetor, but fuel injection was introduced in 1984 on both turbocharged and normally aspirated models (it is used on all 2.5 liter engines). Fuel injection was standard on some higher end models such as the Chrysler E-Class, Laser, and New Yorker, and the Dodge 600 and Daytona. In 1985 fuel injection became optional on the lower end models (Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant), eventually replacing the carbureted variant across the board.

The initial carbureted 2.2 initially produced , but the output was increased to and . Later versions were fuel-injected and produced to and , and a High-Output version for the Dodge Charger produced and .

Four series of turbocharged 2.2 and 2.5 liter engines were produced, normally referred to as Turbo I, Turbo II, Turbo III, and Turbo IV. The primary difference between these engines was the use of an intercooler (in all except Turbo I). The Turbo III, ironically developed after the Turbo IV, was coupled to high-performance, four-valve-per-cylinder head developed in cooperation with Lotus, bringing from the 2.2 liter engine. The Turbo IV pioneered the use of variable nozzle technology to minimize lag.

The 2.2 was made at Chrysler&#x27;s Trenton Engine plant in Trenton, Michigan. In 1995 Chrysler sold much of the machining equipment as well as the license to the design, to First Auto Works of China, after negotiations which had begun in the mid-eighties. The Trenton plant largely switched to the new Chrysler 3.3 engine production, while FAW continues to build the 2.2, which they used in their version of the Audi 100. In 1982, Chrysler also signed an agreement with Perkins Engines to build a dieselized version of the 2.2 (and of the 3.7-liter inline-six) in Windsor, Ontario. Design work on the six had started in 1975, with the 2.2 added to the program in 1980, but due to labor unrest in Canadian automobile manufacture and the collapse of the diesel market in North America, Lee Iacocca suddenly and unilaterally cancelled these plans in 1983.

===High Output===
The 1983 and 1984 Dodge Shelby Charger was more of a handling package, but the regular 2.2 L engine was modified somewhat. This High Output 2.2 used a revised camshaft to boost output to and , and the block was decked to increase the compression ratio. These modifications allowed the Shelby Charger to hit in 5.5 seconds and cover the quarter mile (402 m) in under 16 seconds. The 1985 Dodge Charger Shelby used the 2.2 Turbo I engine instead, so this high output 2.2 was made an option on regular Dodge Chargers that year.

Applications of the High Output 2.2L included the 1983–1984 Dodge Shelby Charger, the 1985 Plymouth Turismo (L-body), the 1984-1985 Dodge Omni GLH and the 1985–1987 Dodge Charger. This High Output version of the 2.2L could be easily recognized by its chrome valve cover and tighter timing cover.

===Turbo I===
Chrysler&#x27;s first turbocharged engine was the 1984 Turbo I. It used a Garrett T03 turbocharger with a mechanical wastegate to limit boost to , and was rated at and , a substantial increase in power over the standard 2.2 engines. Changes included a lower compression ratio, special pistons, high-strength valves, higher-pressure springs (to avoid float), better-sealing rings, a special cam, select-fit bearings, a special exhaust manifold, and a diecast aluminum cylinder head cover.

For 1985, a computer-controlled wastegate was substituted which, with the use of a knock sensor, allowed of temporary overboost. Output was rated at and . A Mitsubishi TE04H turbo and new intake manifold were used for 1988.

===Turbo II===

The Turbo II designation was applied to a turbocharged, intercooled version of the 2.2. This Turbo II designation was first used in the 1986 Shelby GLH-S and the 1987 Shelby Charger GLH-S. Shelby Automobiles modified a stock Turbo I engine by swapping several pre-production pieces from the Turbo II inline-four engine. These changes included an intercooler and other changes to produce 175 hp (130 kW) and a flat 175 ft·lbf (237 N·m) torque curve. Not included were any of the durability changes to the short block (forged crank, full floating pin, stouter connecting rods, etc.) of the 1987 Chrysler Turbo II engine that was produced by the factory the following year. Shelby installed the factory produced Turbo II in his Shelby Lancer and Shelby CSX. Chrysler&#x27;s strengthened version of this engine, with a forged crankshaft and connecting rods, was used in the &quot;Shelby Z&quot; package of the 1987–1989 Dodge Daytona and other cars. Output of the production Turbo II was and with of boost when mated to the stronger A520 5-speed manual transaxle.

A similar, one-piece version of the special two-piece intake manifold used on the Turbo II, minus the air charge temperature sensor, was added to the Turbo I for 1988. The next year, the new common block was introduced; it was used for all subsequent versions of the 2.2 &quot;and&quot; 2.5, including the 2.2 L Turbo II, which then continued unchanged through 1990.

=== Turbo III===
The Turbo III used a Lotus-made DOHC 16-valve head. Output was and . This engine was used in 1,399 Dodge Spirit R/T and several hundred Dodge and Chrysler Daytona IROC R/T models in the US, Canada, and Europe, plus models including the Chrysler Spirit R/T and Phantom R/T in Mexico.

Cars using the 2.2T3 engine include:

The Turbo IV was a turbocharged SOHC intercooled version with variable nozzle turbo (VNT) technology. This system reduced turbo lag. Used in the 1989 Shelby CSX, then regular production 1990 Dodge Shadows, Daytonas, and Chrysler LeBarons. Production on this engine was limited to around 1250 units..

===TC===
The Chrysler TC, developed with Maserati, used a special turbocharged 2.2 engine. This version was related to the &quot;Turbo II&quot; but used a special 16-valve head — not the same as that used in the Turbo III — pistons, connecting rods, intake manifold, crankshaft and other components. No parts are interchangeable with other versions of the engine.

The 2.2 TC engine was an international effort: The cylinder head was cast in England by Cosworth and finished in Italy by Maserati using a cam over bucket design. The pistons are forged and came from Mahle in Germany, and a Japanese turbocharger was sourced from IHI. The camshafts were designed by Florida-based Crane but were constructed by Maserati in Modena. The rods are forged Casar units and use a unique rod bearing size. The crankshaft is also forged and weighs 53 pounds. Only 501 Chrysler TCs were produced with the DOHC 16-valve head. This engine shares essentially only the front and rear main seals, oil pan seal, intermediate shaft and bearings, main bearings (only, rod bearings are unique), and distributor with any other Chrysler 2.2/2.5. This head was also used in IMSA racing, but not in turbocharged form.

==2.5==
In 1986, Chrysler increased the displacement of the engine to and added counterrotating balance shafts to smooth out the vibrations and harsh harmonics normally produced by long-stroke 4-cylinder engines. The increased displacement came from a raised deck and longer stroke, making the 2.5 engine even more undersquare and tuned for low-end torque rather than high-RPM power. This engine replaced the Mitsubishi 2.6 engine Chrysler had been using. In normally aspirated form, the 2.5 produced and . In 1989 there was a redesign of the 2.5 to permit both it and the 2.2 to use a common cylinder block. The crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons are completely different in the common-block 2.5 compared to the previous 2.5. This engine competed with Ford Motor Company&#x27;s HSC engine, which was increased from 2.3 L to 2.5 L for use in the 1986 to 1991 Taurus. The Chrysler 2.5 was retired in 1995.

=== Turbo II===
In the Mexican market, a 2.5 Turbo II engine with intercooler and intake charge temperature sensing was available, rated at and to .

===Carbureted===
 In the Mexican market, 1986 through 1990 vehicles used versions of the 2.2 and 2.5 engines operating on leaded gasoline, equipped with a carburetor, a tubular exhaust header, and electronic control of ignition timing. This induction and ignition system used technology and components very similar to those employed in Chrysler&#x27;s US-market Lean Burn emission control systems of the late 1970s. This configuration was discontinued in favour of electronic fuel injection for the 1991 model year, when exhaust emission regulations took force in Mexico.

===FFV===
From 1993 to 1995, a multipoint fuel injected non-turbo version of the 2.5 engine was installed in flexible-fuel Dodge Spirits and Plymouth Acclaims. This engine and its fuel supply and computerized management system were specially modified to run on fuel containing up to 85% Methanol. Most of the MPFI system was common with the Mexican-market 2.5 MPFI engine. Modifications included upgraded seal and gasket materials, chrome piston rings, stainless-steel fuel system components, sion fuel injectors internally plated with nickel, and fuel composition sensors.

==MPFI==
From 1991 to 1995 in the Mexican market, multipoint fuel injected, non-turbo version of the 2.2 and 2.5 were installed in many Chrysler Corporation vehicles. This version of the 2.5 was rated at , and in most cases lacked the balance shafts used in all other versions of the 2.5. The MPFI system gave better driveability, performance and fuel economy, and cleaner emissions, but was nevertheless not used elsewhere than the Mexican domestic market and Chrysler de Mexico&#x27;s export markets. 

==Engine computers==
Various kinds of Engine Control Units were used with the 2.2 and 2.5 engines. From 1984 to 1987, the ECU was divided into the Logic Module (LM), which was inside the passenger cabin, and the Power Module located near the battery on the left front fender. The LM used a Motorola 6803U4 processor operating at 1 MHz, with 256 bytes of RAM and either two 8K EPROMs or one 16K EPROM. From 1988 to 1989, a SMEC (Single Module Engine Controller) was used. This was a complete redesign of the older system, using modern CAD for board design, and higher density SMD components. The processor was a 68HC11 operating at 2 MHz with 256 bytes of RAM and a 32K EPROM. Functionally, the SMEC was the combination of the earlier Logic and Power modules into one unit. Starting in 1990, a more advanced SBEC (Single Board Engine Controller) was used, which integrated the earlier two board computer into a single board.

<text>TekWar is a series of science fiction novels created by Canadian actor William Shatner, ghost-written by American writer Ron Goulart, and published by Putnam beginning in October 1989. The novels gave rise to a comic book series, video game, and later TV movies and a series, both of the latter featuring Shatner.

==Premise==
The 22nd century universe is centered on &quot;Tek&quot;—an illegal, addictive, mind-altering digital drug in the form of a microchip. The drug creates a simulated reality (and in the films and TV series taps into &quot;the matrix&quot; hyperspace). In the later novels, a new version called &quot;SuperTek&quot; has improved efficiency, is less likely to cause brain damage in users, and features a shared reality, similar to the TV version&#x27;s &quot;matrix&quot;. The protagonist, Jake Cardigan, is a former police officer framed for dealing the drug four years prior to the start of the first novel. Having been sentenced to 15 years&#x27; cryo-imprisonment, his release is brought forward by Walt Bascom, the head of private investigation agency Cosmos, who has uncovered the framed charges and exonerates him. In return Bascom wishes to employ him as an expert in a series of Tek-related crimes, mostly in Greater Los Angeles, referred to as &quot;GLA&quot;. In the first few novels Cardigan is portrayed as a recovering Tek-user with several lapses, but this aspect diminishes as the novels progress - in the first book Gomez comments that 70% of users relapse, while it is implied in later novels that to break the addiction for even a light user is impossible.

Partnered with the good-natured and charismatic Mexican Sid Gomez, the two make up a good cop/bad cop partnership with Cardigan&#x27;s past continually being brought up as a foil for his new career - most honest people he meets distrust him, and most dishonest people attempt to kill him for perceived slights in the drug trade. However, the two prove an effective team and stay a core duo throughout the series, with input from a comprehensive list of informants, employees of both Cosmos, other detective agencies and Cardigan&#x27;s son Dan and his girlfriend Molly - both of whom are enrolled in the GLA police academy and as such have access through their own informant to police files.

The 22nd century is populated with artificial intelligence such as integrated computer systems and &quot;andies&quot; which range from obvious metal robots to highly sophisticated simulacra, some of which are accurate enough to deceive an observer into thinking they are human.

Each novel covers a specific case, all are Tek-related, but most include sub-plots which involve non-Tek issues and travel out of the GLA, occasionally to other countries or as far as orbiting satellites. A shadowy government agency known as OCO - the Office of Clandestine Operations - is a frequent antagonist in the novels, albeit usually keeping to the background and supporting the particular novel&#x27;s villain.

==Background==
Shatner began to write notes that would become the novels on the set of &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;, with the original book an attempt to blend elements from &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;.

==Novels==
#&quot;TekWar&quot; (1989) 
#&quot;TekLords&quot; (1991)

#&quot;Tek Net&quot; (1997) 

==Comic book series==

In 1992, &quot;Tekwar&quot; was adapted into a comic book series.

A new &quot;Tekwar&quot; comic book adaptation, entitled &quot;The Tek War Chronicles&quot;, by Shatner and comic book writer Scott Davis with art by Erich Owen and colors by Michelle Davies, was released by Bluewater Productions on June 24, 2009. As of 2010, &quot;The Tek War Chronicles&quot; is available digitally exclusively through Devil&#x27;s Due Digital.

===Trading cards===
Trading cards with comic book artwork were published by Cardz in 1993.

==Television films and series==

The &quot;TekWar&quot; novels became a television franchise with TV films in 1994, then a series.
The first three were adaptations of the books, while &quot;TekJustice&quot; was an original movie. 

=== Adult animated adaptation ===
An adult animated adaptation/reboot of &quot;TekWar&quot; was announced in September 2021. The project will be developed and written by Matt Michnovetz and produced by Pure Imagination Studios with Shatner&#x27;s Shatner Universe.

==Video game==

&quot;Tekwar&quot; was also made into a 1995 computer game by Capstone Software using the Build engine.

<text>The Indian Campaign Medal is a decoration established by War Department General Orders 12, 1907. The medal was retroactively awarded to any soldier of the U.S. Army who had participated in the American Indian Wars against the Native Americans between 1865 and 1891.

==Background==
The Indian Campaign Medal was established by War Department General Orders 12 in 1907. It was created at the same time as the Civil War Campaign Medal.

The initial ribbon was all red; however, two black stripes were added in December 1917 because of the similarity to a ribbon used by the French for the French Legion of Honor.

Campaign streamers of the same design as the service ribbon are authorized for display by units receiving campaign credit participation for Indian Wars as early as 1790. The inscriptions for streamers displayed on the organizational flag will be as indicated in the unit&#x27;s lineage and honors. The inscriptions for the 14 streamers displayed on the Army flag are listed in AR 840-10 and AR 600-8-22.

==Eligible campaigns==
The service in the following campaigns are eligible for award of the Indian Campaign Medal:
#Southern Oregon, Idaho, northern California, and Nevada between 1865 and 1868.
# Against the Comanches and confederate tribes in Kansas, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and Indian Territory between 1867 and 1875.
#Modoc War between 1872 and 1873.
#Against the Apaches in Arizona in 1873.
#Against the Northern Cheyennes and Sioux between 1876 and 1877.
#Nez Perce War in 1877.
#Bannock War in 1878.
#Against the Northern Cheyennes between 1878 and 1879.
#Against the Sheep-Eaters, Piutes, and Bannocks between June and October, 1879.
#Meeker Massacre against the Utes in Colorado and Utah between September 1879 and November 1880.
#Against the Apaches in Arizona and New Mexico between 1885 and 1886.
#Wounded Knee Massacre against the Sioux in South Dakota between November 1890 and January 1891.
#Against hostile Indians in any other action in which United States troops were killed or wounded between 1865 and 1891.

==Appearance==
The Code of Federal Regulations describes the medal as follows:
The medal of bronze is 11⁄4 inches in diameter. On the obverse is a mounted Indian facing sinister, wearing a war bonnet, and carrying a
spear in his right hand. Above the horseman are the words ‘&#x27;Indian Wars,’’ and below, on either side of a buffalo skull, the circle is completed by arrowheads, conventionally arranged. On the reverse is a trophy, composed of an eagle perched on a cannon supported by crossed flags, rifles, an Indian shield, spear, and quiver of arrows, a Cuban machete, and a Sulu kriss. Below the trophy are the words ‘&#x27;For Service.&#x27;’ The whole is surrounded by a circle composed of the words ‘&#x27;United States Army&#x27;’ in the upper half and thirteen stars in the lower half. The medal is suspended by a ring from a silk moire ribbon 13⁄8inches in length and 13⁄8 inches in width composed of a red stripe (1⁄4-inch), black stripe (3⁄16-inch), red band (1⁄2inch), black stripe (3⁄16-inch), and red stripe (1⁄4-inch).

The Indian Campaign Medal was issued as a one-time decoration only and there were no devices or service stars authorized for those who had participated in multiple actions. The only attachment authorized to the medal was the silver citation star, awarded for meritorious or heroic conduct. The silver citation star was the predecessor of the Silver Star and was awarded to eleven soldiers between 1865 and 1891.

As originally issued, the medal had a solid red ribbon. In 1917 two black stripes were added to the ribbon. The reason for this change is that the ribbon of the Indian Campaign Medal was easily confused with the ribbon of the French Legion of Honor which also had a solid red ribbon.

<doc id="861555" wikidata="Q5114620" url="?curid=861555" title="Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 &amp; 2.4 engine">
<text>The Chrysler 1.8, 2.0, and 2.4 are inline-4 engines designed originally for the Dodge and Plymouth Neon compact car. These engines were loosely based on their predecessors, the Chrysler 2.2 &amp; 2.5 engine, sharing the same bore. The engine was developed by Chrysler with input from the Chrysler-Lamborghini team that developed the Chrysler/Lamborghini Formula 1 V12 engine in the early 1990s.

Beginning in 2005, these engines were phased out in favor of the new World engine built by the Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance joint-venture.

The 2.0 and 2.4 variants were built at Saltillo Engine in Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico. The 1.8 and 2.0 was also built at Trenton Engine in Trenton, Michigan, United States.

==1.8==
The EBD is a 1.8 L (1796 cc/109.6 cid), under-bored variant of the 2.0 L engine. This engine features a square bore and stroke with a 10.0:1 compression ratio. This engine was built at the Trenton Engine Plant for use in export market (non-US) Chrysler Neons. It produces at 5750 rpm and at 4950 rpm and meets Euro III emission standards.

Applications:
* 1997–1999 Chrysler Neon

==2.0==
The 2.0 L (1,996 cc/121.8 cid) version of the engine was the first offered. Production began in 1994 in Trenton, MI, and it was used in many Chrysler Corporation vehicles. It is available in both SOHC and DOHC 16-valve versions (4 valves per cylinder). The engine features a cast iron block, and pistons with shallow crowns to save weight.

The block uses a bedplate featuring a perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons are attached to fracture-split forged, powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A gerotor oil pump is driven directly from the crankshaft on the front of the engine. A timing belt is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a hydraulic tensioner to tension the timing belt. 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002 and up engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the timing belt, with the water pump housing cast partially into the engine block itself.

1995 model year engines had three features that set them apart from later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. 
The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. 
The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft profile that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on.

2002 and earlier engines featured a one-piece cast nodular iron crankshaft with counterweights present on either side of each crank pin. A crankshaft tone wheel was present between number 1 and number 2 connecting rod pins, and was machined such that a Hall-effect magnetic pickup mounted to the engine block could read the crankshaft&#x27;s position as it rotates. 2003 and later engines switched to a two-piece crankshaft. The tone wheel was re-engineered to attach to the crankshaft using three bolts, had a tone pattern substantially different from previous engines, and was moved to the rear of the crankshaft. For this reason, these engines are generally not interchangeable between the 2002 (and prior) and 2003 (and newer) model years.

Up to late 1999, this engine type suffered from oil leaks and head gasket failures between the block and cylinder head. Chrysler Corporation used several different designs of composite material head gaskets in an attempt to solve this problem. The cause of the problem was found to be one head bolt hole that was drilled too shallow at the factory, meaning the head bolt bottomed out and could never seal properly. In 1998, a thicker, multi-layer steel head gasket was introduced that eliminated this problem.

;General Specifications
*Cylinder Configuration: In-line 4
*Number of Valves: 16 (4 per cylinder)
*Fuel Delivery: Sequential multi-port fuel injection
*Bore x Stroke: 
*Displacement: 
*Redline: 6500 rpm
*Rev Limiter: 6750 rpm

===A588===
The A588 is the SOHC version found in most post-2001 Chrysler products. The ECB SOHC version, found in earlier models, is identical except for the crank trigger wheel. When equipped with the newer crank wheel for the new NGC engine computer, the A588 version cannot be directly transplanted into a vehicle originally equipped with the earlier style engine using an SBEC (Single Board Engine Controller). Output is SAE at 5600 rpm with of torque at 4600 rpm. It has an aluminum SOHC cylinder head. It uses a reinforced plastic intake manifold (although a few of the 1995 and 1996 engines received an aluminum intake manifold due to a shortage of the plastic parts). They were painted black, but it&#x27;s easy to see the casting marks and prints on the manifold. The aluminum version is prized among enthusiasts as it is easy to port and polish for improved airflow characteristics.

Applications:
* 1995–2005 Dodge Neon/Plymouth Neon 
* 1995–2000 Dodge Stratus/Plymouth Breeze

Specifications:
*Compression Ratio: 9.8:1
*Camshaft Configuration: SOHC
*Power: at 6000 rpm
*Torque: at 4600 rpm

===Magnum===
The Magnum SOHC version, code ECH, develops SAE at 6500 rpm, and of torque at 4800 rpm. Chief differences between this version and the A588 include a cast aluminum SOHC cylinder head that more easily passes exhaust gases than the base engine, a camshaft that is optimized for higher engine speeds, a factory welded exhaust short-tube header instead of a cast exhaust manifold, and a two-piece intake manifold. This manifold features unequal-length intake runners that are switched by an electric actuator that controls butterfly-type valves in the shorter intake runners. The longer runners are always open, and provide a mild supercharging effect due to their length between 3000 rpm and 4800 rpm. The shorter runners, open from 4800 rpm to redline at wide-open throttle, also provide a tuned resonance effect due to their length. The shorter runners are also opened at wide-open throttle below 3000 rpm to provide an intake path to each cylinder that is as free-flowing as possible.

Applications:
* Dodge Neon R/T (2001–2004)U.S (1998-2004)Canada
* Dodge Neon ACR (2001–2002)U.S (1998-2002)Canada

Specifications:
*Compression Ratio: 9.8:1
*Camshaft Configuration: SOHC
*Power: at 6500 rpm
*Torque: at 4800 rpm
*Rev-Limiter: 6750 rpm

===ECC===
The DOHC ECC 2.0 produces SAE at 6500 rpm with of torque at 4800 rpm. It has a cast iron engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder head. It uses Sequential fuel injection, has 4 valves per cylinder with roller rocker arms and features fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshafts, and an aluminum intake manifold.

The version used in the PT Cruiser (non-US) and Dodge Neon features a cylinder head with the intake ports facing the front of the vehicle, like the SOHC A588. The 420A used in the Dodge-designed chassis, such as the Dodge Avenger and Mitsubishi Eclipse, have intake ports facing the rear of the vehicle. Most other specifications are identical, however, and even some head components (such as the valve cover) are compatible.

Applications:
* Dodge Neon/Plymouth Neon (1995–1999) (ECC)
* Mitsubishi Eclipse/Eagle Talon (second generation, 1995–1999) (420A)
* Dodge Avenger/Chrysler Sebring (1995–1999) (420A)
* Chrysler PT Cruiser (non-US) (ECC)

Specifications:
*Compression Ratio: 9.6:1
*Camshaft Configuration: DOHC
*Displacement: 
*Power: at 6500 rpm
*Torque: at 4800 rpm
*Rev-Limiter: 7500 rpm

== 2.4 and 2.4 Turbo==
The Naturally Aspirated (N/A) version was used in Chrysler&#x27;s JA, JX, and JR platform cars from 1995 to 2006 along with the Jeep Liberty from 2002 to 2005 and the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager from 1996 to 2000. The code for this engine was EDZ. As with some other engines of various architecture used in some Jeeps, EDZs used in the Liberty carried Chrysler&#x27;s PowerTech name.

The first 2.4L turbocharged engine was the EDZ turbo (variant of regular EDZ engine and developed by Chrysler&#x27;s Mexican division), used on the Mexican Dodge Stratus R/T &amp; Cirrus since 1996 to 2000. It was developed as a replacement for the earlier single-cam 2.2L and 2.5L turbo engines that were very popular in Mexico.

The turbocharged EDV/EDT was initially developed for the PT Cruiser GT as a way to add power, and is similar to the regular EDZ. As the PT Cruiser was based on the Neon platform, PVO engineers were able to take the EDV/EDT and make it work with minor non-costly changes for the SRT-4. Output is SAE at 5300 rpm with of torque at 2200-4400 rpm. This engine, code A855, has a cast iron partially open deck block and split crankcase. It uses an 8.1:1 compression ratio with Mahle cast eutectic aluminum alloy pistons, forged connecting rods with cracked caps and threaded-in rod bolts, and a cast high-hardness steel crankshaft. The cylinder head is cast aluminum, with the cylinder heads being a 48-degree pent-roof design with a partial cloverleaf between the intake valves. The valves are actuated by hydraulically adjusted rocker arms with roller cam followers.

The SRT-4, PT Cruiser Turbo, Cirrus LXi [México only] and Stratus R/T [México only] use the same engine block and heads.

The intake manifold, reverse-rotation turbocharger, jet oil coolers, oil pump, manual transmission, pcm tuning, intercooler size, and weight are the only differences between those cars. The SRT-4 has a cast-aluminum 8-row Valeo intercooler mounted in the front, and the reverse-rotation Mitsubishi TD04LR-16Gk turbocharger has a turbine inlet. The turbocharger compressor housing features a built-in bypass valve, and the turbo housing is cast into the exhaust manifold with a loop-around flow pattern. The boost level varies anywhere from to , depending on the PCM&#x27;s desired torque target and temperature conditions, but will be reduced if significant knock is detected. Such as using low octane (less than 91 R+M/2) gas. 

The Turbo-Lite option for the PT Cruiser offered a de-tuned EDV/EDT that could run on regular 87 octane (R+M/2) gas, making SAE at 5300 rpm.

<doc id="861556" wikidata="Q3055048" url="?curid=861556" title="Enterasys Networks">
<text>Enterasys Networks, Inc. was an American networking company. Enterasys products included networking equipment ranging from routers, switches, and IEEE 802.11 wireless access points and controllers. The company formed in March 2000 as a spin-off of Cabletron Systems.

In addition to networking hardware such as switches, routers and wireless products, the company sold software for managing and securing networks such as intrusion prevention systems, network access control and security information management.

The company&#x27;s headquarters were in Salem, New Hampshire.

== History==
Enterasys had their initial public offering on August 6, 2001, with its shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange under symbol ETS.

It claimed a $12.9 million profit in its first quarter after it was spun out of Cabletron in June 2001. A restatement in 2002 for recognizing revenue in improper time periods resulted in several quarters of losses.

An investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and shareholder lawsuits was settled in October 2003 for $50.4 million. In 2004, a former executives pleaded guilty for fraud.

At a December 2006 trial, four former executives were sentenced to prison terms and several others found guilty.

In November 2005, Enterasys was acquired by Alec Gores&#x27; private equity firm, Gores Group, and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, in a going-private transaction estimated at $386 million. In April 2006, The Gores Group named Mike Fabiaschi as CEO. Fabiaschi had to deal with renewing trust relationships with customers, to &quot;fix the company.&quot; In 2008, Enterasys sought to increase revenue to $1 billion and make one or two acquisitions.

On July 29, 2008, The Gores Group announced its partnership with Siemens to acquire the German company&#x27;s enterprise communications business, known as Siemens Enterprise Communications. The Gores Group acquired a 51% stake in Siemens Enterprise Communications (SEN). As part of the $550 million transaction, Gores Group offered two of its assets: Enterasys and SER Solutions, a Virginia-based contacts management provider.

On September 22, 2008, Fabiaschi died suddenly. Mark Stone, chairman of the board, was named interim CEO and completed the joint venture transaction. Chris Crowell became CEO and president of Enterasys.

Enterasys enterprise networking and SEN&#x27;s telephony and wireless products were integrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siemens/Enterasys Enterprise Communications Integration Begins&quot;&gt;Enterasys/Siemens Enterprise Communications Integration Begins , Bill Terrill, Current Analysis, Nov. 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, appeals from the fraud cases continued through 2009.

On September 12, 2013, Extreme Networks announced they would acquire Enterasys for about $180 million cash.

<doc id="861557" wikidata="Q7596551" url="?curid=861557" title="Staff God">
<text>In &quot;Southern Andean Iconographic Series&quot; the Staff God pose is a religious icon and a standardized pose reminiscent in its way of the standardized poses in Byzantine art. The pose shows a front-facing human or human-like figure with vertical attributes, one in each hand. There is no uniform representation of a &quot;Staff God&quot;. Dozens of variations of &quot;Staff Gods&quot; exist. Some scholars think that some of these personages are possible depictions of Viracocha or Thunupa (the Aymara weather god). However, there is little evidence to support the idea that these front-facing figures do represent deities. Some researchers point to their attributes and spatial organization which seem to indicate that they are ritual practitioners. Some attributes in their hands were identified as Qirus (Andean ritual cups), Snuff trays (used in ceremonial contexts) and Spear-throwers. The &quot;rays&quot; radiating or sprouting out of the faces of Tiwanaku front-facing figures appear to have approximately the value of an aureole. They may represent flows and distribution of energy. At the Wari site of Conchopata a vessel was found which shows a Staff God in which the &quot;rays&quot; can be interpreted as a Anadenanthera colubrina tree sprouting from its head whereas the circular elements do represent its seed pods.

The oldest known depiction of a Staff God was found in 2003 on some broken gourd fragments in a burial site in the Pativilca River Valley (Norte Chico region) and carbon dated to 2250 BCE. This makes it the oldest religious icon to be found in the Americas.

There are scholars who maintain that the Wari-Tiwanaku Staff God is the forerunner of the Incan principal gods, Sun, Moon, and Thunder. It served as the primary religious icon of the entire Peruvian Andes, particularly during the Early Horizon (900-200 BC) and beyond. The worship of Staff Gods spread to the Central Andes during the Middle Horizon (600-1000 CE) This is supported by excavated Middle Horizon artifacts that resembled the Staff-God.

== Representations and iconography ==
The staff god was a basic iconography shared by the cultures of pre-Columbian Peru, particularly those occupying the northern coast and the southern highlands. This is seen in the stylistic uniformity of the icons and representations, which suggested widespread adherence.

There were varying depictions of the Staff-God among these Andean cultures. However, it was often portrayed as a deity in apotheosis, with hands always holding instruments of power. For instance, an artifact found at Chavin de Huantar showed the deity holding a Spondylus and Strombus shells, which were female and male symbols, respectively. This representation indicated how the Staff-God wielded authority to maintain social harmony and the Andean ideal of gender complementarity. Another Early Horizon sculpted stone, the Raimondi Stele, is perhaps the most popular representation and depicted the Staff-God as a sky or lightning god plunging down to earth.

Representations of the southern highland staff god did not only carry motifs but were also presented with accompanying consorts in the form of deities painted on textiles used to decorate temple walls or ceramic vessels.

The Staff God has one of the most important iconographical elements in central Andean archaeology and this is prominent in both portable and fixed art using different media such as stone, textile, and ceramic. A form of the staff god, for example, takes a central role in the Sun Gate of the Tiwanaku culture, a single-stone monolith. Tunics and ceramics from both the Tiwanaku and Wari cultures of the Middle Horizon period showcase a similar god. Another example is the giant offering jars found at Qunchupata. They were painted with the Staff-God&#x27;s image, one that bears resemblance to the god&#x27;s depiction at the back of the Tiwanaku&#x27;s Ponce Monolith.

<doc id="861562" wikidata="Q751637" url="?curid=861562" title="Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Fermanagh and South Tyrone is a Northern Ireland parliamentary constituency in the British House of Commons. It is currently represented by Pat Cullen of Sinn Féin.

==Boundaries==
The constituency was created in 1950 when the old Fermanagh and Tyrone two-member constituency was abolished as part of the final move to single-member seats. As the name implies, it includes all of County Fermanagh and the southern part of County Tyrone. Of the post-1973 districts, it contained all of Fermanagh, and Dungannon and South Tyrone. In boundary changes resulting from a review in 1995, however, a section of Dungannon and South Tyrone (then called Dungannon) district, around the town of Coalisland, was transferred to the Mid Ulster constituency.

1950–1983: The county of Fermanagh, the Urban District of Dungannon, the Rural Districts of Clogher and Dungannon, and that part of the Rural District of Omagh consisting of the district electoral divisions of Aghafad, Dervaghroy, Dromore, Drumharvey, Ecclesville, Fallaghearn, Fintona, Greenan, Killskerry, Lifford, Moorfield, Rahoney, Seskinore, Tattymoyle and Trillick.

1983–1997: The District of Fermanagh, and the District of Dungannon.

1997–2024: The District of Fermanagh, and the District of Dungannon wards of Augher, Aughnacloy, Ballygawley, Ballysaggart, Benburb, Caledon, Castlecaulfield, Clogher, Coolhill, Drumglass, Fivemiletown, Killyman, Killymeal, Moy, Moygashel, and Mullaghmore.

2024–present: The District of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon, the District of Fermanagh and Omagh wards of Blackwatertown, Ballinamallard, Belcoo &amp; Garrison, Belleek &amp; Boa, Boho, Cleenish &amp; Letterbreen, Brookeborough, Castlecoole, Derrygonnelly, Derrylin, Donagh, Ederney &amp; Kesh, Erne, Florence Court &amp; Kinawley, Irvinestown, Lisbellaw, Lisnarrick, Lisnaskea, Maguiresbridge, Newtownbutler, Portora, Rosslea, Rossorry, and Tempo, and the District of Mid Ulster wards of Augher &amp; Clogher, Aughnacloy, Ballygawley, Ballysaggart, Caledon, Castlecaulfield, Fivemiletown, Killymeal, Moy, Moygashel, and Mullaghmore.

==History==
For the history of the constituency prior to 1950, see Fermanagh and Tyrone.

Throughout the existence of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, there has been a rough balance between unionist and nationalist voters, though in recent years the nationalists have had a slight majority. Many elections have seen a candidate from one community triumph due to multiple candidates from the other community splitting the vote. Perhaps because of this balance between the communities, Fermanagh and South Tyrone has repeatedly had the highest turn-out (and the smallest winning margin) of any constituency in Northern Ireland.

The seat was won by the Nationalist Party in 1950 and 1951, the closely contested 1951 election seeing a 93.4% turnout – a UK record for any election.

In 1955 the constituency was won by Philip Clarke of Sinn Féin, but he was unseated on petition on the basis that his criminal conviction (for Irish Republican Army activity) made him ineligible. Instead, the seat was awarded to the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) candidate.

In 1970 the seat was won by Frank McManus, standing on the &quot;Unity&quot; ticket that sought to unite nationalist voters behind a single candidate. In the February 1974 general election, however, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) contested the seat, dividing the nationalist vote and allowing Harry West of the UUP to win with the support of the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party.

In the October 1974 general election a nationalist pact was agreed and Frank Maguire won, standing as an Independent Republican. He retained his seat in the 1979 general election, when both the unionist and nationalist votes were split, the former by the intervention of Ernest Baird, leader of the short-lived United Ulster Unionist Party, and the latter by Austin Currie, who defied the official SDLP decision to not contest the seat. Maguire died in early 1981.

The ensuing by-election took place amidst the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike. As part of the campaign for the five demands of the prisoners, the Provisional Irish Republican Army Officer Commanding in the Maze prison, Bobby Sands, was nominated as an Anti-H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner candidate. Harry West stood for the UUP, but no other candidates contested the by-election. On 9 April 1981, Sands won with 30,492 votes against 29,046 for West. 26 days later Sands died on hunger strike. Speedy legislation barred prisoners serving a sentence of 12 months or longer from standing for Parliament, and so in the new by-election Sands&#x27; agent Owen Carron stood as a &quot;Proxy Political Prisoner&quot;. The UUP nominated Ken Maginnis. The second by-election in August was also contested by the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the Workers&#x27; Party Republican Clubs, a candidate standing on a label of General Amnesty and another as The Peace Lover. The turn-out was even higher, with most of the additional votes going to the additional parties standing, and Carron was elected. In the 1982 election for the Northern Ireland Assembly, Carron headed the Sinn Féin slate for the constituency and was elected.

Republicans suffered a reversal in the 1983 general election, when the SDLP contested the seat. Maginnis won and held the seat for the UUP for the next eighteen years until he retired. By this point boundary changes had resulted in a broad 50:50 balance between unionists and nationalists and it was expected that a single unionist candidate would hold the seat in the 2001 general election. James Cooper was nominated by the UUP. On this occasion, however, both the nationalist and unionist votes were to be split. Initially, Maurice Morrow of the DUP was nominated to stand, with the DUP fiercely opposing the UUP&#x27;s support for the Good Friday Agreement. Morrow then withdrew in favour of Jim Dixon, a survivor of the Enniskillen bombing who stood as an Independent Unionist opposed to the Agreement. Tommy Gallagher of the SDLP ran, but his intervention did not do enough damage to Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin&#x27;s Michelle Gildernew won by 53 votes over Cooper. Subsequently, the result was challenged amid allegations that a polling station had been kept open by force for longer than the deadline, allowing more people to vote, but the courts—while conceding that this happened—did not uphold the challenge, because it held that the votes cast after the legal closing time would not have affected the outcome.

Ahead of the 2005 general election, there was speculation that a single unionist candidate could retake the seat. The UUP and DUP, however, ran opposing candidates and in the event Gildernew held her seat. She kept the seat at the 2010 general election by four votes over the Unionist candidate, Rodney Connor. Following the election, Connor lodged an election petition challenging the result, based on a dispute about differences in the number of ballot papers recorded at polling stations and those subsequently recorded at the count centre. The petition was rejected after it was found that only three extra votes remained unaccounted for. The judge ruled that &quot;even if those votes were introduced in breach of the rules and if they had all been counted in favour of the first respondent their exclusion would still have given the first respondent (Ms Gildernew) a majority of one vote and the result would not have been affected.&quot;

In the election of May 2015 Sinn Féin&#x27;s Michelle Gildernew lost the seat to the UUP&#x27;s candidate Tom Elliott. Although Elliott was running for the UUP, he was also being actively supported by the DUP, the Traditional Unionist Voice and the UK Independence Party. The Conservative Party also refused to run a candidate in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, despite running in 16 out of the other 17 constituencies. Just as in the February 1974 and 1983 elections, faced with a single Unionist candidate, the SDLP refused to discuss a nationalist pact with Sinn Féin.

Gildernew re-captured her seat in the snap June 2017 election. In the 2019 election she was re-elected with a majority of just 57 votes (the narrowest result in the UK), despite the DUP withdrawing and the SDLP standing a candidate. This made the 2019 election the second time in under ten years that Fermanagh and South Tyrone has been the seat with the smallest winning majority in the UK.

In the General Election 2024, Royal College of Nursing chief Pat Cullen announced that she would contest the seat representing Sinn Féin. Cullen won the seat, with a majority of 4,486 votes despite being against single unionist candidate, Diana Armstrong of the UUP. Cullen increased Sinn Féin&#x27;s vote share in Fermanagh South Tyrone by 6.7%, securing the largest Nationalist majority since the 2005 general election.

Caroline Wheeler is a member of the United Kingdom Labour Party who ran as an independent in the seat as the Labour Party do not run in Northern Ireland.

This was the smallest majority at the 2019 general election.












Rodney Connor had the support of the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Conservatives and Unionists. Following the close result, Connor lodged an election petition against Gildernew alleging irregularities in the counting of the votes had affected the result. However the High Court found that there were only three ballot papers which could not be accounted for, and even if they were all votes for Connor, Gildernew would have had a plurality of one. The election was therefore upheld.

<text>James Clark (born 12 March 1963) was a British diplomat. He served as the British Ambassador to Luxembourg from 2004 to 2007 and now leads the British Consulate General in Chicago. He was called &quot;a new breed of diplomat&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot;. A career diplomat, he was assigned to the European Union first secretariat in Bonn, Germany.

Clark&#x27;s appointment as British Ambassador to Luxembourg in March 2004 was heralded with some small controversy, due largely to his being openly gay.

On 30 March 2004, he and his partner Anthony Stewart made history by becoming the first officially recognised gay couple to have an audience with Queen Elizabeth II.

<text>East Fork Road, located in the San Gabriel Mountains above the city of Azusa, California, is a road that gives access from State Route 39 into East Fork and other small townships, including Camp Williams and Julius Klein Conservation Fire Camp 19, a minor offender prisoner housing complex where &quot;LACO fire personnel provide training, which prepares inmates to safely conduct wild land firefighting operations.&quot;

The road begins at Route 39, passing over the San Gabriel River, and follows the east fork of the river, crossing a number of small streams. The terminus is Heaton Flats, which has a campsite, a toilet facility, and trails that lead upstream and to the summit of Iron Mountain, above.

Along East Fork Road there are extensive fire-fighting facilities which are staged to combat the many fires that break out among the foothills above Azusa, Glendora, and San Dimas every year. The road is located within the Angeles National Forest and is managed by the United States Forest Service.

The United States Forest Service states that all mining operations, including gold panning, are illegal along the East Fork; Additionally, since the area’s designation as a National Monument in 2014, all resource extraction is prohibited (as is the case on all National Monuments). Some of the sites of the area&#x27;s mining heritage can be accessed from the road by visiting the site of &quot;Eldoradoville&quot;, a mining town with three stores and six saloons that was established in 1859 and washed away in the flood of January 18, 1862.

East Fork Road was initially planned as an outlet from the Los Angeles Area to State Route 2 and includes a &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; that was abandoned after a flood; a later plan included two never-used tunnels on the aborted Shoemaker Canyon Road.

In January 2005, a flood washed out two bridges, which stranded 200 campers and residents for days.

==Road Remains==
Parts of the old destroyed sections of the East Fork roadway can still be found as one hikes from Heaton Flats and heads generally East along the riverbed. Sections of destroyed bridge supports give hikers clues as to where the roadway used to be located; however, extensive sections of the asphalt-covered road still exist and lead up to Laurel Gulch and the John Seals Bridge, which is located just before one enters the Sheep Mountain Wilderness.

Once inside the designated wilderness the above-ground and still-visible sections of the old destroyed length of the East Fork Road become fewer and fewer until eventually there are no more sections to be found.

<text>The Tritec engine (also known as Pentagon) is a four-cylinder petrol engine that was manufactured between 1999 and 2007 by Tritec Motors in Brazil and was used in various cars including Chrysler and Mini models.

==Tritec Motors Ltda==
In 1997, Chrysler Corporation and Rover Group (then a subsidiary of BMW) formed a joint venture called Tritec Motors to design a new small straight-4 engine. The new company built a factory in Campo Largo of Curitiba, Brazil specifically to manufacture the new engine. The Tritec name stands for the union of the three countries involved: Germany, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.

When BMW broke up the remains of Rover Group in 2000, BMW kept the stake in Tritec Motors because the engine was in use in the Mini range which BMW had retained. In 2007 BMW sold its 50% stake to DaimlerChrysler and cancelled its contract for the Tritec engine. BMW entered into a new joint venture with PSA Peugeot Citroen to develop the Prince engine which is used in the second generation Mini cars. 

The factory had a capacity of 400,000 engines a year, and in 2006 production was around 200,000 engines. Production ceased in June 2007 following the ending of the joint venture. 

In March 2008 Fiat Powertrain Technologies bought the plant and licenses to produce Tritec engines at a cost of €83 million, and in 2010 subsequently launched its own E.torQ engine.

==Engine details==
It is a modern engine with an SOHC 16-valve head, electronic throttle control, and meets Euro IV emissions requirements. There are three versions of the engine, , and supercharged .

BMW complained about the performance of the engine. According to Ward&#x27;s Auto, Erich Sonntag of BMW described the Tritec engine as old fashioned and not very effective on function, performance and fuel efficiency. This was no news to the Rover Group engineers on the MINI project, who had wanted to use Rover&#x27;s K-Series engine, an older design which had similar power output and fuel efficiency, but was built next door to the proposed MINI line at Longbridge, and already had amortised its R&amp;D.

===1.4 (T14a)===
The version uses a bore and stroke of . Like all Tritecs, it is an SOHC 16-valve cast iron engine with an aluminium cylinder head and multipoint sequential electronic fuel injection. Output is rated at and .

Applications:
*Mini One (Portugal, Greece) (until 2008)

===1.6 (w10b16a)===
The version uses the same bore with a longer stroke. Output is rated at and in the Mini One, and and in the Mini Cooper and Chrysler PT Cruiser.

Applications:
*Chery A11 (Windcloud)
*Chery A15 (Flagcloud)
*Chrysler Neon (in non-US markets)
*Chrysler PT Cruiser (in non-US markets)
*Lifan 620
*Lifan 520
*Mini Hatch and Convertible (until 2008).

===1.6 SC (w11b16a)===
The 1.6 SC uses an Eaton M45 Roots type supercharger with intercooler. The compression ratio is reduced from 10.5:1 to 8.3:1. Output was initially rated at and of torque and increased to and . The SC won the &quot;1.4 L to 1.8 L&quot; category at the International Engine of the Year awards for 2003. It also won Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines award for 2003.

The 2006 Mini John Cooper Works GP Kit was upgraded to at 7,100 rpm and of torque at 4,600 rpm.

Applications:
*Mini Hatch Cooper S
*2006 Dodge Hornet concept car

<text>Meat Beat Manifesto, often shortened as Meat Beat, Manifesto or MBM, is an electronic music group originally consisting of Jack Dangers and Jonny Stephens that was formed in 1987 in Swindon, United Kingdom. The band, fronted by Dangers (the only permanent member), has proven versatile over the years, experimenting with techno, breakbeat, industrial, dub and jazz fusion while touring the world and influencing major acts such as Nine Inch Nails, the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy. Some of the band&#x27;s earlier work has been credited with influencing the rise of the trip hop, big beat, and drum and bass genres.

==History==

===Early years===
Dangers and Stephens had formed the English pop group Perennial Divide in 1986 with Paul Freeguard and released the first few Meat Beat Manifesto singles as a side project. The first release under the Meat Beat name was 1987&#x27;s &quot;Suck Hard&quot; EP on Sweat Box Records. They left Perennial Divide in 1988 to record a full Meat Beat album. The tapes of what would have been the debut MBM album were claimed to have been destroyed in a studio fire before it could be released (detailed in a publicity statement). The former founder of Sweat Box Records (Rob Deacon) said that the fire never happened. Jack Dangers confirmed the story of the fire in a 2010 interview. The pair then recorded the LP &quot;Storm The Studio&quot;, which got them pigeonholed as an industrial act because Sweat Box Records sold the rights to the LP to Wax Trax Records for release in the United States. In response, they released &quot;99%&quot; in May 1990, which was more techno-influenced and characterized by heavy beats and ubiquitous samples. In August they released &quot;Armed Audio Warfare&quot;, which was an effort to re-create the lost tracks of the would-be début album.

The band&#x27;s live show was conceived as an intense audio-visual experience, with dancers, led by choreographer Marcus Adams, in costumes and sets designed by artist Craig Morrison and video clips accompanying live instruments, sequenced electronic instruments, and live DJing. In the United States, they opened for Nine Inch Nails on their debut national tour in 1990. In 1991, they performed at The Limelight in Manhattan and toured North America with Consolidated. Despite his contributions being nonmusical in nature, Adams was credited as a full band member and appeared in many of the band&#x27;s record sleeves and promo photos until the release of &quot;Satyricon&quot; in 1992. Adams also appeared in several of MBM&#x27;s early videos, such as &quot;Strapdown&quot; and &quot;Psyche-Out&quot;.

1992&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot; continued to show Meat Beat adopting a more mainstream electronic sound, crediting influences of such newly popular dance bands as Orbital, The Shamen, and The Orb, all of whom had either remixed or been remixed by MBM. The album produced the hits &quot;Mindstream&quot; and &quot;Circles&quot;. &quot;Original Control (Version 2)&quot;, renamed &quot;I Am Electro&quot; in later compilations, is the best-known track from the album, featuring samples of recordings from the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair exhibit Elektro The Robot, and was the opening song in MBM&#x27;s 2005–2006 tour.

===Nothing Records years, 1994–1998===
In 1993, Dangers relocated from England to San Francisco, resulting in Stephens&#x27; departure from the band. At this time, Nothing Records was founded as an imprint of Interscope with the purpose of signing industrial and electronic bands to capitalize on the recent success of Nine Inch Nails. Nothing, helmed by Trent Reznor, signed Meat Beat Manifesto and in 1996 the double album &quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot; was released. While this album represented MBM&#x27;s major-label debut, it failed to achieve the critical and commercial successes of previous releases. The album is notable for the last appearance of Jonny Stephens who contributed guitar on the track Asbestos Lead Asbestos. After &quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot;, Dangers put together an album called &quot;Original Fire&quot; that collected various studio rarities, B-sides, and fan favorites from the early years of MBM, in addition to some new remixes of the material. Also in 1996, the group contributed to the AIDS benefit album produced by the Red Hot Organization.

In 1997, Dangers recruited drummer Lynn Farmer and multi-instrumentalist John Wilson (MBM member 1995–1998, former Supreme Love Gods) to record and release &quot;Actual Sounds + Voices&quot; in 1998, which found the group&#x27;s earlier flirtations with jazz fusion featured more prominently; the record included appearances by saxophonist Bennie Maupin. The album yielded the single &quot;Prime Audio Soup&quot; which was featured in the film &quot;The Matrix&quot; and its soundtrack. While Jon Wilson left the band prior to the 1998–1999 tour, Farmer remains with the band as of Spring 2007. Wilson was replaced by former Consolidated programmer Mark Pistel, who also remains a contributing member.

During these years, Dangers contributed a pair of remixes to high-profile Nine Inch Nails releases &quot;Closer to God&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot;. After the release of &quot;Actual Sounds + Voices&quot;, Meat Beat Manifesto was let go by Nothing Records and once more appeared on independent labels.

===&quot;RUOK?&quot;, 2000–2004===
In 2000, Dangers released a 12&quot; MBM EP of four new songs called &quot;Eccentric Objects&quot; which demonstrated a shift in Dangers&#x27; output towards simpler song structure and less sonically dense layering. This evolution in form was full realized two years later, in 2002, with the release of Meat Beat Manifesto&#x27;s seventh full-length album, &quot;RUOK?&quot;. This album prominently featured Dangers&#x27; newly acquired EMS Synthi 100, as well as guest contributions from turntablist Z-Trip and The Orb&#x27;s Alex Paterson. In 2003 MBM released a remix album for &quot;Storm The Studio&quot;, followed by &quot;...In Dub&quot;, a remix album of &quot;RUOK?&quot;.

===&quot;At the Center&quot;, 2005–2007===
&quot;At the Center&quot; was released on 29 May 2005. A part of independent label Thirsty Ear&#x27;s &#x27;Blue Series&#x27; fusing jazz with electronic genres, the album is a collaboration between Jack Dangers and jazz musicians Peter Gordon (flute), Dave King (drums), and Craig Taborn (keyboards). While Dangers had, in the past, flirted with jazz instrumentation and sampling on a handful of Meat Beat Manifesto tracks, &quot;At the Center&quot; was a marked variation of the expected MBM sound and was more of a one-off experiment than a whole new direction for the band. The album has been well received by many critics, with one reviewer calling it &quot;one of the best albums of the year in &quot;any&quot; genre.&quot; An EP of outtakes, live tracks and a remix titled Off-Centre was released shortly after.

From 2005 through 2006, MBM launched a worldwide tour, their first since 1999, making use of video sampling technology that allowed the band to trigger video clips in real-time, on two large screens positioned stage front, while the band performed either side-stage or behind the screens, out of the audience&#x27;s view; instead, live video footage of the band performing was displayed onscreen alongside the pre-assembled clips. Many of the video clips used were the sources of samples previously used in various MBM tracks, such as footage of Elektro the Robot and clips from films such as &quot;Head&quot; and &quot;Dark Star&quot;. Dangers and crew performed a wide variety of hits and fan favorites from the entire back catalog, though relatively little of the new jazz fusion material from &quot;At the Center&quot; was played.

In 2006, Meat Beat Manifesto&#x27;s &quot;Suicide&quot; was released on the and is the only MBM track to date to prominently feature a guitar.

In May 2007 Dangers released a double CD titled &quot;Archive Things 1982-88 / Purged&quot;. The first disc contained many early Meat Beat Manifesto experimentations, including demos of what would later become seminal MBM tracks such as &quot;I Got the Fear&quot;. The second disc was an instrumental version of the Perennial Divide album, &quot;Purge&quot;.

===&quot;Autoimmune&quot; and &quot;Answers Come in Dreams&quot;, 2008–2010===
MBM&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Autoimmune&quot;, was released on 7 April 2008 in Europe via Planet Mu Records and on 8 April 2008 in the US and Canada via Metropolis Records., with each territory&#x27;s issue featuring a different track listing. The album featured the first vocals by Dangers himself since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Actual Sounds + Voices&quot;, as well as collaborations with DJ Z-Trip, MC Azeem, and Kenneth James Gibson. The album has been described as a return to an older, harder MBM sound and as a dubstep album, though Dangers has stated that he prefers not to fall into any specific genre or category with his work. The lead single, &quot;Guns And Lovers&quot; was released as a digital single via iTunes on 18 March 2008, while the track &quot;Lonely Soldier&quot; was released as a single via bleep.com. Meat Beat Manifesto once more toured to support the new album with the same stage setup as the 2005–2006 tour.

Meat Beat Manifesto released &quot;Answers Come in Dreams&quot; in late 2010, once more via Metropolis Records in the US and via Hydrogen Dukebox in the UK. &quot;Answers Come in Dreams&quot; continued to reference dubstep as had its predecessor &quot;Autoimmune&quot;, but overall was a darker, denser album, at times descending into beatless ambient noise passages reminiscent of the experimental second disc of 1996&#x27;s Subliminal Sandwich.

===&quot;Impossible Star&quot; and &quot;Opaque Couché&quot;, 2011-present===

After the release of &quot;Answers Come in Dreams&quot;, Meat Beat Manifesto entered a period of limited activity lasting several years. Between 2011 and 2016, a small handful of EPs were released, and MBM only performed live sporadically. They appeared at the Cold Waves V festival in Chicago in 2016, the first live Meat Beat Manifesto show in five years. The following September they performed at Cold Waves LA.

In January 2018, Meat Beat Manifesto released their eleventh studio album &quot;Impossible Star&quot; on the label Flexidisc. First single &quot;We Are Surrounded&quot; was premiered online by Igloo Magazine on 24 October 2017. The album has been called a &quot;proverbial return to form&quot; after the dalliances with dubstep on &quot;Autoimmune&quot; and &quot;Answers Come in Dreams&quot;. MBM also contributed an original track to the Cold Waves VII benefit compilation later that year, and a limited U.S. tour took place in the fall.

&quot;Opaque Couché&quot;, Meat Beat Manifesto&#x27;s twelfth album, was released on 10 May 2019 via Flexidisc. The track &quot;Pin Drop&quot; was released as a video single on YouTube on 6 March, with &quot;No Design&quot; following on 1 April. Considered a companion album to &quot;Impossible Star&quot;, &quot;Opaque Couché&quot; was named after &quot;the world&#x27;s ugliest color&quot;.

MBM debuted a brand new song and video and contributed a pre-recorded performance set to the Cold Waves 2020 &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;; the entire festival was streamed on Twitch due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in the United States. The new song also appeared on the corresponding Cold Waves 2020 compilation.

<doc id="861568" wikidata="Q6972766" url="?curid=861568" title="National Forest Adventure Pass">
<text>The National Forest Adventure Pass is a recreation fee pass issued by the United States Forest Service that permits bearers in designated regions of four National Forests in Southern California to park their cars for the purpose of recreation. Though it was introduced during the &quot;Recreation Fee Demonstration Program&quot; (Fee-Demo) which ended on November 21, 2004, the Forest Service continues to administer the program, nearly unchanged, under the Federal Lands and Recreation Enhancement Act. This act, derisively dubbed by some as the &quot;Recreation Access Tax&quot; (RAT), was passed in December 2004 as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill. The four national forests it applies to are the Angeles National Forest, Cleveland National Forest, Los Padres National Forest and San Bernardino National Forest.

It is the local element of the controversial national Recreational Fee Demonstration Program system that imposes fees on the public to use public lands.

The Legislative Counsel of California has determined that the Forest Service may not cite cars for parking on state highways within national forests unless there is evidence that the occupants have used the forest for recreational purposes (for example, the occupants have been observed entering the forest). The Forest Service invites those who feel they have been cited unjustly to write to an address on the citation to appeal. This determination was made after a large number of incidents occurred where property owners were cited for parking on their own property, in communities completely contained in the San Bernardino National Forest.

Passes may be purchased for annual or day use online or from visitor centers and local merchants. Violators usually receive a &quot;Notice of Noncompliance&quot; and may clear the notice by purchasing a pass after the violation, paying online, or sending in a check or money order to the address in the envelope provided. Punishment of noncompliant individuals has been rare. In theory, use of the forests for non-recreational, First Amendment purposes does not require an Adventure Pass. In addition, using the restroom, stretching, or taking a picture is not a violation.

After passage of the Recreational Enhancement Act in 2004, Adventure Passes are now only required at designated High Impact Recreational Areas. However, in fact most areas that previously required a parking pass still require one. To avoid a fine, a wise hiker will telephone a Forest Service office or check the maps of High Impact Recreational Areas online of the individual forests to determine in advance his or her permit needs, since adequate signage pertaining to the need for an Adventure Pass is not yet common. Although supposedly many areas do not require the pass, most of these locations are less convenient to populated areas and can be accessed only from areas that do require a pass.

Fees collected via purchases of the Adventure Pass/Notice of Required Fee help directly fund the recreation program on each of the forests involved which includes purchasing trash bags, toilet paper, paint, wood for picnic tables, campfire rings, stoves, etc. as well as salary funding to hire rangers to care for the forest, clean bathrooms, pick up trash, answer visitor questions, enforce regulations, and serve the public. The proceeds from these fees stay local and do not go back into a central, national fund.

== Controversy ==

The continued collection of fees for use of the National Forest Lands remains controversial since the 9th circuit court of appeals ruled in February 2012 in the case Adams v. U.S. Forest Service, that &quot;The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (&quot;REA&quot;)&quot;, the authority under which the fee structure was enacted, &quot;prohibits the United States Forest Service from charging fees &quot;[s]olely for parking&quot;. In spite of this clear prohibition, what many consider to be &quot;parking only&quot; fees are still required at numerous locations in the San Bernardino and Angeles National Forests as well as other National Forest Locations.

The ruling stated that while fees are allowed in certain instances, the &quot;fee&quot; sites must conform to the following requirements as listed below:

* (A) that provides significant opportunities for outdoor recreation;
* (B) that has substantial Federal investments;
* (C) where fees can be efficiently collected; and
* (D) that contains all of the following amenities:
* (i) Designated developed parking.
* (ii) A permanent toilet facility.
* (iii) A permanent trash receptacle.
* (iv) Interpretive sign, exhibit, or kiosk.
* (v) Picnic tables.
* (vi) Security services.

The Forest Service &quot;maintains that the latter part of § 6802(d)(1)(A), which prohibits fees &quot;solely for . . . picnicking along roads or trailsides,&quot; clearly permits fees for road or trailside picnics that take place within a larger area (delineated by the Forest Service) if that larger area offers amenities&quot;.

The Court rejected such an interpretation of the REA statute stating:

&quot;Because this reading is so illogical, we will consider another interpretation of the agency&#x27;s position. Perhaps the Forest Service is really saying that a fee is &quot;[s]olely for parking&quot; when imposed in a location where a visitor has no option to do something else, whether or not that &quot;something else&quot; is an amenity required by the statute.&quot;

The Court further went on to illustrate:

&quot;Consider what would happen if a restaurant-goer inspected his bill and noticed an unexpected charge. If told that the fee was for ten bottles of wine that the patron&#x27;s group neither ordered nor drank, the patron would rightly be outraged. He would not find much solace in a waiter&#x27;s explanation that the wine cellar contained ten bottles, which the patron could have ordered if he wished.&quot;

The Court clarified the motive behind such reasoning:

&quot;By ignoring the plain text, the Forest Service arrives at an interpretation that would enable an end-run around the clear statutory restrictions. If the REA gave the agency complete discretion to dictate a fee&#x27;s so-called purpose, then the agency could entirely evade the prohibition on parking fees by simply declaring that its fees are &quot;for&quot; something else too. At any of the places where subsection (f) contemplates recreation fees, it is possible for a visitor to do something more than park a car—take photos of a volcano, make a cell phone call, chew a piece of gum—and a visitor must use a facility or service to be subject to a subsection (g) fee. Therefore, the agency could simply say that its parking fee is also &quot;for&quot; those other activities. Because the REA has a plain meaning that does not lead to an absurd result, we have no need to afford deference to the agency&#x27;s competing, nonsensical interpretation.&quot;

The court then concluded:

&quot;...the REA unambiguously prohibits the Forest Service from charging fees... for recreational visitors who park a car, then camp at undeveloped sites, picnic along roads or trailsides, or hike through the area without using the facilities and services.&quot;

In spite of this ruling the fees continue to be collected.

<text>The Windermere House is a historic hotel and resort located in Windermere, Ontario, within the Muskoka region of Canada. 

It was built in 1870 in the Victorian style as a boarding house. It overlooks Lake Rosseau. Originally intended as the residence of Thomas Aitken, who purchased the land in 1863 after relocating from Scotland, the house later expanded to accommodate guests. 

Aitken&#x27;s subsequent home nearby would become the Windermere Cottage. Windermere House remained in the family&#x27;s possession until 1981, when it was acquired by an investment group. The name Windermere is derived from a village and lake in Northern England, and it is often referred to as The Lady of the Lakes by locals. 

In 1996, a fire broke out during the filming of &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;, resulting in the destruction of the 127-year-old Windermere House. The cause of the fire remains unsolved, with some speculating it was due to production equipment lights and others suggesting a short circuit. The house, along with the boat house and marina, was subsequently rebuilt and restored in 1997.

The Windermere House features 56 guest rooms, multiple restaurants, a pub, and a private 4-bedroom cottage with an adjacent water tower built in the 1920s. 

Situated behind the house is the Windermere Golf &amp; Country Club, which was established in 1919 and boasts an 18-hole golf course. The resort also offers amenities such as an outdoor pool, tennis court, playground, church, marina, and beach for recreational activities. Spanning 2500 square miles, including the golf course and surrounding wilderness, Windermere House is the largest resort in the area.

<text>Poniec is a town in western Poland, situated in the southern part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship. The town has 2912 inhabitants (as of 2023). It is the capital of Gmina Poniec (commune) in Gostyń County.

==History==

Poniec dates back to the 10th century, when it was part of the emerging Polish state. The oldest known mention comes from 1108. It was granted town rights before 1309. It was a private town, administratively located in the Kościan County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. Crafts, especially clothmaking, developed and the town prospered until the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1655–1660. The Battle of Poniec occurred nearby on 28 October 1704 during the Great Northern War.

After the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793 it was annexed by Prussia. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia. The local population was subjected to harsh Germanisation policies, however local Poles established various organizations, including a local branch of the &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society. Many inhabitants took part in the Greater Poland uprising (1918–19), after which Poniec was reintegrated with Poland in 1919, shortly after it regained independence.

During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, German troops entered the town on 6 September 1939. The Polish population was subjected to arrests, executions and expulsions. In the following months, many residents were imprisoned in the town hall. On 21 October 1939 the Germans carried out a public execution of local Poles. It was one of many massacres of Poles committed by Germany on 20–23 October 1939 across the region in attempt to pacify and terrorize the Polish population. Over 300 Poles were expelled to the General Government, mostly to Tarnów. First Polish families were expelled in December 1939. Many inhabitants were taken to forced labour or murdered in concentration camps. The town was captured by the Soviets in January 1945 and afterwards restored to Poland.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Leszno Voivodeship.

==Culture==
Dziecięco-Młodzieżowa Orkiestra Dęta przy GCK w Poniecu, wind orchestra composed of volunteer (non-paid) amateur musicians works in town as a part of Municipal Cultural Center (Gminne Centrum Kultury). The orchestra is present during most holidays, e.g. Polish Independence Day or International Firefighters&#x27; Day. The orchestra also organizes New Year&#x27;s Concerts for thousands of people from all over the country every year, inspired by the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concerts.
In 2023 the orchestra won the title of Vice-Champion of Poland in Polish Wind Band Championships in Radom.
In addition to the many awards regularly won by the orchestra at national festivals, it is worth mentioning the two greatest International successes. 
In 2018 the band won three awards during the International Brass Band Festival in Giulianova, Italy: Best Youth Brass Band, Best Brass Band and Best Conductor of the Festival.
Another important success was participation in Rasteder Musitage in Germany. The band, although initially entered into the basic category, was moved to the advanced group at the jury&#x27;s request and received very high marks from each of the jurors; out of 100 possible points, the orchestra scored 86.17, which qualified it for the gold medal.
The orchestra was also awarded honorary badge of Merit for Polish Culture (Zasłużony dla Kultury Polskiej) in 2022.

Also since 2018 one of the largest Rally of Historical Reenactment Groups in Greater Poland takes place in Poniec. The annual, several-day event is organized under the name &quot;Operacja Poniec&quot; (Operation Poniec) consists of a parade around the market square, the camp area open to visitors, with dioramas and reenactors&#x27; camps located in the City Park, outdoor cinema and historical battle reenactments. Groups taking part in the event recreate soldiers and civilians from every point in history, from the Middle Ages and the Battle of Grunwald, through the Swedish Invasion of Poland, the Napoleonic Wars, World War I and World War II, Cold War conflicts such as Northern Ireland and Vietnam, to modern troops including the German Bundeswehr. The largest one yet was IV Operacja Poniec in 2023 with 36 groups and dozens of reenactors from all over Poland.

<doc id="861575" wikidata="Q1987577" url="?curid=861575" title="Donald Crowhurst">
<text>Donald Charles Alfred Crowhurst (1932 – July 1969) was a British businessman and amateur sailor who disappeared while competing in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, round-the-world yacht race held in 1968–69. Soon after starting the race his boat, the &quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot;, began taking on water. Crowhurst secretly abandoned the race while reporting false positions in an attempt to appear to complete a circumnavigation without actually doing so. His ship&#x27;s logbooks, found after his disappearance, suggest that stress and associated psychological deterioration may have led to his suicide.

Crowhurst&#x27;s participation in the race has exerted a fascination over many commentators and artists. It has inspired a number of books, stage plays and films, including a documentary, &quot;Deep Water&quot; (2006), and two feature films, &quot;Crowhurst&quot; and &quot;The Mercy&quot; (both 2017), in which Crowhurst is played by the actors Justin Salinger and Colin Firth, respectively. &quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot; ended its days as a dive boat in the Caribbean and its decaying remains can still be found in the dunes above a beach in the Cayman Islands.

==Early life==
Donald Crowhurst was born in 1932 in Ghaziabad, British India. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father worked in the Indian railways. During her pregnancy, his mother had longed for a daughter, and Crowhurst was dressed as a girl until the age of seven. After India gained independence, his family moved back to England. The family&#x27;s retirement savings were invested in an Indian sporting goods factory, which later burned down during rioting after the partition of India.

Crowhurst&#x27;s father died in 1948. Because of family financial problems, Crowhurst was forced to leave school early that year and started a five-year apprenticeship at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Airfield. In 1953 he received a Royal Air Force commission as a pilot, but was asked to leave in 1954 for reasons that remain unclear, and was subsequently commissioned into the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in 1956. After leaving the Army the same year owing to a disciplinary incident, Crowhurst eventually moved to Bridgwater, where he started a business called Electron Utilisation in 1962. He was a member of the Liberal Party and was elected to Bridgwater Borough Council.

===Business ventures===
Crowhurst, a weekend sailor, designed and built a radio direction finder called the Navicator, a handheld device that allowed the user to take bearings on marine and aviation radio beacons. While he did have some success selling his navigational equipment, his business began to fail. In an effort to gain publicity, he started trying to gain sponsors to enter the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Golden Globe Race. His main sponsor was English entrepreneur Stanley Best, who had invested heavily in Crowhurst&#x27;s failing business. Once committed to the race, Crowhurst mortgaged both his business and home against Best&#x27;s continued financial support, placing himself in a grave financial situation.

==The Golden Globe Race==
The Golden Globe Race was inspired by Francis Chichester&#x27;s successful single-handed round-the-world voyage, stopping in Sydney. The considerable publicity his achievement garnered led a number of sailors to plan the next logical step – a non-stop, single-handed, round-the-world sail.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; had sponsored Chichester, with highly profitable results, and was interested in being involved with the first non-stop circumnavigation, but it had the problem of not knowing which sailor to sponsor. The solution was to promote the Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, round-the-world race, open to all comers, with automatic entry. That was in contrast to other races of the time, for which entrants were required to demonstrate their single-handed sailing ability before entry.

Entrants were required to start between 1 June and 31 October 1968, to pass through the Southern Ocean in the summer. The prizes offered were the Golden Globe trophy for the first single-handed circumnavigation, and a £5,000 cash prize for the fastest. This was then a considerable sum, equivalent to almost £73,000 in 2023.

The other contestants were Robin Knox-Johnston, Nigel Tetley, Bernard Moitessier, Chay Blyth, John Ridgway, William King, Alex Carozzo and Loïck Fougeron. &quot;Tahiti&quot; Bill Howell, a noted multihull sailor and competitor in the 1964 and 1968 &quot;OSTAR&quot; races, originally signed up as an entrant but did not actually race.

Crowhurst hired Rodney Hallworth, a crime reporter for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and then the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, as his public relations officer.

===Crowhurst&#x27;s boat and preparations===
The boat Crowhurst built for the voyage, &quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot;, was a modified trimaran designed by Californian Arthur Piver. At the time, this was an unproven type of boat for a voyage of such length. Trimarans have the potential to sail much more quickly than monohulled sailboats, but early designs in particular could be very slow if overloaded, and had considerable difficulty sailing close to the wind. Trimarans are popular with many sailors for their stability, but if capsized (for example by a rogue wave), they are virtually impossible to right, though crews have lived for months with a boat in the inverted position and ultimately survived.

To improve the safety of the boat, Crowhurst had planned to add an inflatable buoyancy bag on the top of the mast to prevent capsizing, the bag would be activated by water sensors on the hull designed to detect an impending capsize. This innovation would hold the mast horizontal on the surface of the water, and a clever arrangement of pumps would allow him to flood the uppermost outer hull, which would (in conjunction with wave action) pull the boat upright. His scheme was to prove these devices by sailing round the world with them, then go into business manufacturing the system.

However, Crowhurst had a very short time in which to build and equip his boat while securing financing and sponsors for the race. In the end, all of his safety devices were left uncompleted, he planned to complete them while under way. Also, many of his spares and supplies were left behind in the confusion of the final preparations. To top all this, Crowhurst had never sailed on a trimaran before taking delivery of his boat several weeks before the beginning of the race.

On 13 October an experienced sailor, Lieutenant Commander Peter Eden, volunteered to accompany Crowhurst on his last leg from Cowes to Teignmouth. Crowhurst had fallen into the water several times while in Cowes, and as he and Eden climbed aboard &quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot;, he once again ended up in the water after slipping on the outboard bracket on the stern of the rubber dinghy. Eden&#x27;s description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor before the start of the race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler self-steering gear to come loose. Eden said, &quot;We had to keep leaning over the counter to do up the screws. It was a tricky and time consuming business. I told Crowhurst he should get the fixings welded if he wanted it to survive a longer trip!&quot; Eden also commented that the Hasler worked superbly and the boat was &quot;certainly nippy.&quot;

Eden reported that Crowhurst&#x27;s sailing techniques were good, &quot;But I felt his navigation was a mite slapdash. I prefer, even in the Channel, to know exactly where I am. He didn&#x27;t take too much bother with it, merely jotting down figures on a few sheets of paper from time to time.&quot; After struggling against westerlies and having to tack out into the Channel twice, they arrived at 2.30 pm on 15 October, where an enthusiastic BBC film crew started filming Eden in the belief he was Crowhurst. There were 16 days to get ready before the race&#x27;s deadline on 31 October.

===Departure and deception===
Crowhurst left from Teignmouth, Devon, on the last day permitted by the rules: 31 October 1968. He encountered immediate problems with his boat, his equipment, and his lack of open-ocean sailing skills and experience. In the first few weeks he was making less than half of his planned speed.

According to his logs, he gave himself only 50/50 odds of surviving the ocean, assuming that he was able to complete some of the boat&#x27;s safety features before reaching the dangerous Southern Ocean. Crowhurst was thus faced with the choice of either quitting the race and facing financial ruin and humiliation or continuing to an almost certain death in his unseaworthy, disappointing boat.

Over the course of November and December 1968, the hopelessness of his situation pushed him into an elaborate deception. He shut down his radio with a plan to loiter in the South Atlantic for several months while the other boats sailed the Southern Ocean, falsify his navigation logs, then slip back in for the return leg to England. As last-place finisher, he assumed his false logs would not receive the same scrutiny as those of the winner.
Since leaving, Crowhurst had been deliberately ambiguous in his radio reports of his location. Starting on 6 December 1968, he continued reporting vague but false positions; rather than continuing to the Southern Ocean, he sailed erratically in the southern Atlantic Ocean and stopped once in South America to make repairs to his boat, in violation of the rules. A great deal of the voyage was spent in radio silence, while his supposed position was inferred by extrapolation based on his earlier reports. By early December, based on his false reports, he was being cheered worldwide as the likely winner of the fastest circumnavigation prize, though Francis Chichester privately expressed doubts about the plausibility of Crowhurst&#x27;s progress.

After rounding the tip of South America in early February, Moitessier had made a dramatic decision in March to drop out of the race and to sail on towards Tahiti. On 22 April 1969, Robin Knox-Johnston was the first to complete the race, leaving Crowhurst supposedly in the running against Tetley for second to finish, and still able to beat Knox-Johnston&#x27;s time, because of his later starting date. In reality, Tetley was far in the lead, having long ago passed within of Crowhurst&#x27;s hiding place; but believing himself to be running neck-and neck with Crowhurst, Tetley pushed his failing boat, also a Piver trimaran, to breaking point, and had to abandon ship on 30 May.

The pressure on Crowhurst had therefore increased, since he now looked certain to win the &quot;elapsed time&quot; race. If he appeared to have completed the fastest circumnavigation, his logbooks would be closely examined by experienced sailors, including the experienced and sceptical Chichester, and the deception would probably be exposed. It is also likely that he felt guilty about undermining Tetley&#x27;s genuine circumnavigation so near its completion. He had by this time begun to make his way back as if he had rounded Cape Horn.

Crowhurst made his last radio transmissions on 29 June. His last logbook entry is dated 1 July. &quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot; was found adrift, unoccupied, on 10 July.

=== Mental condition and final philosophical writings ===
Crowhurst&#x27;s behaviour as recorded in his logs indicates a complex and troubled psychological state. His commitment to fabricating the voyage reports seems incomplete and self-defeating, as he reported unrealistically fast progress that was sure to arouse suspicion. By contrast, he spent many hours painstakingly constructing false log entries, often more difficult to complete than real entries because of the celestial navigation research required.

The last several weeks of his log entries, once he was facing the real possibility of winning the prize, showed increasing irrationality. His biographers, Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall, believe that faced with a choice between two impossible situations—either admit his fraud and then face public shame and likely financial ruin including the loss of the family home, or return home to a fraudulent hero&#x27;s reception, and then have to live with the guilt and possible subsequent unmasking—Crowhurst descended into a &quot;classical paranoia&quot;, a &quot;psychotic disorder in which deluded ideas are built into a complex, intricate structure.&quot; Others, including practising clinical psychologist Geoff Powter, who included a chapter devoted to Crowhurst in his book &quot;Strange and Dangerous Dreams: The Fine Line Between Adventure and Madness,&quot; have postulated that Crowhurst may have suffered from undiagnosed bipolar disorder, which, accentuated by his eventual psychologically fraught situation, could account for his apparent alternation between manic and depressed episodes as evident from the later entries in his logbooks. On 24 June, he began to document these thoughts in a new set of writings in his second logbook, entitled &quot;Philosophy.&quot; Although rambling and incoherent at times, he was attempting to set down, for the benefit of mankind, a &quot;revelation&quot; or new understanding that he believed he had discovered regarding the relationship between man and the universe. Life, as experienced by man, was a &quot;game&quot;, overseen by &quot;cosmic beings,&quot; apparently God (or several gods) and the Devil, who set the rules by which &quot;the game&quot; was played. However, man could, by an effort of will, become one such &quot;second generation cosmic being&quot; himself, and thereby withdraw from &quot;the game&quot; on his own terms if he so wished. He would then enter a world of &quot;abstract intelligence&quot; (the realm of gods) in which he would have no need for his body, or any of the other trappings of daily life. At one point he wrote that this &quot;revelation&quot; made him happy:

whereas at other points his writings documenting mental arguments—with himself, with Albert Einstein, or with God—reveal a tortured soul on the brink of self destruction. While suicide is not explicitly mentioned as an escape route, Tomalin and Hall believe that Crowhurst (whether or not he was admitting it to himself) was groping towards this eventuality with phrases such as &quot;The quick are quick, and the dead are dead. That is the judgement of God. I could not have endured the terrible anguish and meaningless waiting, in fact,&quot; as well as &quot;Man is forced to certain conclusions by virtue of his mistakes.&quot;

He continued his writings for a week, eventually amounting to more than 25,000 words. At 10 a.m. on 1 July (by his own reckoning, since in his meditations he had omitted to wind his chronometer and had to subsequently restart it), Crowhurst commenced what Tomalin and Hall believed to be his &quot;final confession,&quot; also incorporating (in their view) a count of hours, minutes and seconds towards the time at which he had decided that he would end &quot;the game&quot; by committing suicide. His observations over the next 80 minutes are generally cryptic and/or incomplete, but include hints such as:
It is unclear from the spacing whether &quot;11 20 40&quot; was the time of his last entry, or whether it runs on from the preceding wording as his intended time for his ultimate action. Likewise, while the phrase &quot;IT IS THE MERCY&quot; is obscure, most commentators have accepted that it signifies his relief that, at last, he is leaving an unbearable situation.

Tomalin and Hall conjecture that included in his last writings (not all reproduced above) were sentences that cover Crowhurst&#x27;s internal debate over whether or not to leave the evidence of his actual, rather than faked, journey for posterity to see, and that he decided that the former was the better course; in the event, it was the &quot;true&quot; logbook that was left behind, and the &quot;fake&quot; one (if it ever existed) disappeared, along with the vessel&#x27;s chronometer (its case was found empty), and Crowhurst himself. The disappearance of the vessel&#x27;s chronometer (clock), apparently following Crowhurst&#x27;s final diary entry, remains unexplained.

=== Disappearance and presumed death ===
Crowhurst&#x27;s last log entry was on 1 July 1969, it is assumed that he then either fell or stepped overboard and drowned. The state of the boat gave no indication that it had been overrun by a rogue wave, or that any accident had occurred which might have caused Crowhurst to fall overboard. From his apparent state of mind as indicated by his most recent logbook entries and philosophical statements, it seems likely that he deliberately decided to take his own life, possibly in an effort to become a &quot;second generation cosmic being&quot; according to his belief (and thereupon have no further need for his earthly body), although the possibility that he met with some sort of accident, intending to return to continue writing in his logbook, cannot be completely dismissed. Three logbooks (two navigational logs and a radio log) and a large mass of other papers were left on his boat to communicate his philosophical ideas and to reveal his actual navigational course during the voyage. The boat was found with the mizzen sail up. Although his biographers, Tomalin and Hall, discounted the possibility that some sort of food poisoning contributed to his mental deterioration, they acknowledged that there is insufficient evidence to rule it, or several other hypotheses, out. They also acknowledged that other hypotheses could be constructed, involving further deception—such as that Crowhurst had perhaps faked his own death, and somehow survived—but that these were extremely unlikely.

Clare Crowhurst, Donald&#x27;s widow, strongly disputed the theory put forward by Tomalin and Hall regarding the circumstances of her husband&#x27;s deception and demise, accusing them of mixing fiction with fact. In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; published on 10 July 1970, she contended that there was no evidence that her husband had intended to write a fake logbook (none was in fact found), that his death could equally have been as the result of misadventure (such as an accident while climbing the mast, which a logbook entry showed that he intended to do before 30 June), and also that Tomalin believed that &quot;all heroes are neurotics, and starting off with this theory, he has sought to prove it by the history of Donald from the earliest age until his death&quot;. Nevertheless, later commentators have agreed with Tomalin and Hall&#x27;s general conclusions, that Crowhurst&#x27;s long sojourn alone at sea, coupled with his being placed in an impossible dilemma, led to his eventual psychological breakdown and resulting probable suicide.

Interviewed by journalist Chris Eakin for his 2009 book &quot;A Race Too Far&quot;, Crowhurst&#x27;s now adult son Simon, when asked whether he believed that his father deliberately stepped off the boat to kill himself, said that on the balance of probabilities (and having studied the logbooks, now in his possession, many times), &quot;it is hard to come to any other conclusion. ... [however] I don&#x27;t think he did see it as killing himself. He saw it as a kind of transformation into another state of being. In that sense I don&#x27;t see it as suicide either. He was thinking in a totally different realm by that stage.&quot; And in his chapter dealing with Crowhurst, psychiatrist Edward M. Podvoll in his 1990 book &quot;Recovering Sanity: A Compassionate Approach to Understanding and Treating Psychosis&quot; writes: &quot;In an empty, drifting boat he [Crowhurst] left moment-to-moment journals and logs of his mental content and of the inexpressible states of mind through which he had passed. They describe almost a caricature of the psychotic predicament and the stage: leading to self-transformation. As well as logging his states of mind, often every few minutes, his notations also catch lightning flashes of his momentary awakenings from delusion. Naked between the sky and sea, hopelessly beyond his means, caught in a web of deception that had fooled the yachting world and the international press, and in fear of disgrace and dishonor, Crowhurst declared radio silence and &quot;switched&quot; from the natural world into a cosmic theater of his mind.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===After the race===

&quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot; was found adrift and abandoned on 10 July 1969 by the RMV &quot;Picardy&quot;, at . News of Crowhurst&#x27;s disappearance led to an air and sea search in the vicinity of the boat and its last estimated course. Examination of his recovered logbooks and papers revealed the attempt at deception, his mental breakdown and eventual presumed suicide. This was reported in the press at the end of July, creating a media sensation.

Before the deception was revealed, Robin Knox-Johnston donated his £5,000 winnings for fastest circumnavigation to Donald Crowhurst&#x27;s widow and children. Nigel Tetley was awarded a consolation prize and built a new trimaran.

Teignmouth council considered a proposal to exhibit the boat, charging visitors 2/6d per head, with profits to go to Crowhurst&#x27;s wife and four children.

&quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot; was later taken to Jamaica and was sold several times, being repurposed and refitted, first as a cruise boat in Montego Bay and later as a dive boat in the Cayman Islands, before being hauled out following a minor incident in 1983, but later damaged by a hurricane and never repaired. The boat still lies decaying on the southwest shore of Cayman Brac.

===Reputation and reappraisal===
If Crowhurst had finished the race, his fake coordinates would undoubtedly have been exposed and he would have been treated as a fraud, in addition to being in probable financial ruin. From his surviving logbooks, while it is possible that his eventual presumed suicide was a rational choice to avoid having to confront such a situation and/or to seek an &quot;honourable&quot; exit without disrespecting his family, it seems more likely that his final metaphysical ramblings, which subsequent analysts have interpreted as clear evidence of a classic psychotic state, led to his abandoning both his body and the world while under the conviction that he had no further need of them. Either way, near-contemporary accounts of his actions were not particularly sympathetic. Once his disappearance and deception were revealed, contemporary news accounts were far from flattering: in the 2006 documentary &quot;Deep Water&quot; a 1969 newspaper headline is shown which reads: &quot;LONE SAILOR FAKED WORLD VOYAGE&quot;, while in the same documentary, a journalist of the day, Ted Hynds states: &quot;No one likes to be conned... we were sharp newspapermen, and he conned us.&quot; The 1970 book &quot;The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst&quot; by two &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalists has been described as &quot;largely unflattering&quot;. However, over time the public narrative has changed somewhat, more recent commentators viewing Crowhurst as a well-intentioned but tragic figure who became caught up in a situation that was initially of his own making but that he could not ultimately control. James Marsh, the director of the film &quot;The Mercy&quot;, has said: &quot;He made a pretty good go at sailing round the world. He stayed out in the ocean for the best part of seven months so all in all, he achieved much more than people ever thought he could, he just didn&#x27;t achieve what his objective was. It was a case of over-reach, it was hubris and that is what caused the tragedy of his demise.&quot;

Jonathan Raban has written that
Tomalin and Hall wrote in 1970:
Others have commented that in the intervening time, lessons are there to be learned from Crowhurst&#x27;s tragedy. Writing on his site &quot;Sailing Calypso&quot;, Rick Page, author of &quot;Get Real, Get Gone: How to Become a Modern Sea Gypsy and Sail Away Forever&quot;, says:
==In popular culture==

Crowhurst&#x27;s participation in the race and apparent eventual fate have given rise to a number of works. As Jonathan Coe wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;one of the explanations for its [Crowhurst&#x27;s stories] resonance and longevity must be that it can be interpreted in so many different ways&quot;.

===Movies and documentaries===
* &quot;Donald Crowhurst – Sponsored for Heroism&quot; (1970) a BBC TV film written and narrated by Paul Foot and directed by Colin Thomas
* &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot; was a 1975 television movie about Crowhurst (called &quot;Philip Stockton, a Canadian&quot; in the film).
* &quot;Alone&quot; was a 1979 BBC South West television documentary about Crowhurst with investigative journalist Jeremy James. The documentary aired on the tenth anniversary of Crowhurst&#x27;s disappearance.
* The 1982 French movie &quot;Les Quarantièmes rugissants&quot; (&quot;The Roaring Forties&quot;) is directly inspired by the Crowhurst story.
* The 1986 Soviet film &quot;Race of the Century&quot; gives a dramatic presentation of the events of the Golden Globe Race and the fate of Donald Crowhurst (Leonhard Merzin). The movie focuses on the idea of competition in a capitalist society as a soul-consuming &quot;rat race&quot;, where all community members including children are under constant pressure and failure and poverty are not tolerated. It portrays Crowhurst as a deeply honest man being forced into a dangerous unwinnable enterprise by his disastrous financial situation and the greed of entrepreneur Best. Crowhurst&#x27;s suicide is ascribed chiefly to the inability of a moral person to survive in an immoral society. The film includes a portrayal of the Crowhurst family and a dramatic enactment of Donald&#x27;s descent into insanity leading to fatalism. This film has passed relatively unnoticed, and today it is known mainly because Natalia Guseva played the role of Crowhurst&#x27;s daughter Rachel.
* &quot;The Two Voyages of Donald Crowhurst&quot;, a thirty-minute BBC Two documentary first broadcast in 1993.
* British artist Tacita Dean created two experimental short films entitled &quot;Disappearance at Sea I&quot; (1996, 6 minutes?) and &quot;II&quot; (1997, 16-mm film, 4-min. loop), partly inspired by the story of Donald Crowhurst. She also published an art book about &quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot; (Book Works, London, 1999), journeying to Cayman Brac to visit the wreck of the boat. Out of the latter project also came a photographic piece and another short film &quot;Teignmouth Electron 2000&quot; (16-mm film, 7 minutes).
* Film Four commissioned a documentary based on the affair in 2006, called &quot;Deep Water&quot;. The film reconstructs Crowhurst&#x27;s voyage from his own audio tapes and cine film, interwoven with archive footage and interviews. It was described as &#x27;fascinating&#x27; by the &quot;New York Times&quot; upon its release.
* In 2013 a short film called &quot;Une route sans kilomètre&quot; was made by Sophie Proux and Laurent Lagarrigue, telling Crowhurst&#x27;s story. 
* 2017 saw the release of &quot;Crowhurst&quot;, directed by Simon Rumley. The executive producer of the film was Nicolas Roeg, who had himself attempted to film the story in the 1970s.
* &quot;The Mercy&quot; was released in 2018 with Colin Firth as Donald Crowhurst and Rachel Weisz as Clare, supported by David Thewlis, Ken Stott and Jonathan Bailey. The film was directed by James Marsh and filmed in Teignmouth, Devon.

===Stage===
*At the 1991 Edinburgh Festival Fringe a one-man stage play called &quot;Strange Voyage&quot; was performed in the former Ukrainian Church Halls on Dalmeny Street in Leith.

<text>Karl Blodig (16 October 1859 – 7 September 1956) was an Austrian mountaineer, optician, and writer. Blodig was the first to successfully climb all Alpine peaks of over 4000 meters, completing his final summit around 1911. He wrote about these climbs in his book &quot;Die Viertausender der Alpen&quot; (&quot;The Four-Thousanders of the Alps&quot;), first published in 1923.

==Mountaineering Life==
Born in Vienna, Blodig spent his early years in Graz, climbing Mount Triglav while still in his teens. At the age of twenty he climbed Monte Rosa, guided by Christian Ranggetiner, and by twenty-three he had made non-guided ascents of the Dufourspitze, Zumsteinspitze, and Weisshorn. Between 1890 and 1911 he succeeded in climbing the remaining peaks to achieve all those summits that were at that time listed as being over 4,000 m in height. These achievements included first ascents of the Brouillard Ridge on Mont Blanc as well as the first traverse of the Rochefort Ridge. Among his alpine climbing partners were Ludwig Purtscheller and the Alpine artist Edward Theodore Compton.

Around 1911 Blodig was part of a regular mountaineering meeting at Pen-y-Pass in Wales, among whom was George Mallory. Blodig observed Mallory expertly tackling a crux pitch of a very difficult ice chimney. Even though all the climbing friends present were impressed by Mallory&#x27;s skill as a climber, Blodig later observed rather prophetically about Mallory that: &quot;that young man will not be alive for long!&quot;

In 1932, and at the age of 73, Blodig undertook solo ascents of the Aiguille du Jardin and the Grande Rocheuse in order to achieve summits that had subsequently been added to the recognised list of 4,000 m peaks since his 1911 achievement.

<doc id="861589" wikidata="Q931534" url="?curid=861589" title="Coleman Francis">
<text>Coleman Chambers Francis (January 24, 1919 – January 15, 1973) was an American actor, writer, producer and director. He was best known for his film trilogy consisting of &quot;The Beast of Yucca Flats&quot; (1961), &quot;The Skydivers&quot; (1963) and &quot;Red Zone Cuba&quot; (1966), all three of which were filmed in the general vicinity of Santa Clarita, California.

==Early life==

Francis was born in Greer County, Oklahoma in 1919. He was the son of William F. Francis and Scytha Estes. During the Great Depression, he moved to Texas.

==Career==
In 1940, Francis headed for Hollywood to start an acting career. His plans were initially interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served in the medical detachment of the 49th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division. He played minor parts in several films from the late 1940s to early 1970s, often without credit, including &quot;Blondie&#x27;s Reward&quot; (1948), &quot;Scarlet Angel&quot; (1952), &quot;The Girl in White&quot; (1952), &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot; (1954), &quot;This Island Earth&quot; (1955), &quot;Twilight for the Gods&quot; (1958), &quot;Motorpsycho&quot; (1965) and &quot;P.J.&quot; (1968). 1958 brought his first credited role, &quot;Stakeout on Dope Street&quot;, where he played a detective.

During March 1958, Francis portrayed Matthew Harrison Brady opposite Sidney Blackmer as Henry Drummond in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; at the Sombrero Playhouse in Phoenix, Arizona.

In 1959, Francis formed a partnership with Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Cardoza, a welder by trade, and together they created three films: &quot;The Beast of Yucca Flats&quot; (1961), &quot;The Skydivers&quot; (1963) and &quot;Night Train to Mundo Fine&quot;, aka &quot;Red Zone Cuba&quot; (1966). Francis wrote and directed the films, while Cardoza handled production duties.

Toward the end of his life, Francis had a small role in Ray Dennis Steckler&#x27;s 1969 movie &quot;Body Fever&quot;. His last work in the film industry was in 1970, when he played a drunk in Russ Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;.

==Personal life==
Francis married Barbara Francis, and while the two had divorced prior to the filming of &quot;The Beast of Yucca Flats&quot;, she was cast as Lois Radcliffe in &quot;Beast&quot; and appeared as the wife of a spectator (played by Coleman) in its follow-up, &quot;The Skydivers&quot;. They had two sons, Alan and Ronald, who appeared as Art and Randy Radcliffe in &quot;The Beast of Yucca Flats&quot; and the spectator&#x27;s sons in &quot;The Skydivers&quot;.

==Death==
Francis died in California on January 15, 1973, at the age of 53. Though arteriosclerosis is listed as the official cause of death, Cardoza says Francis&#x27; body was found in the back of a station wagon at the Vine Street Ranch Market with &quot;a plastic bag over his head and a tube going into his mouth or around his throat&quot;. Francis is interred at the Columbarium of Remembrance in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
After fading into obscurity for decades, Francis&#x27; three directed films gained cult status after being featured on the TV show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in the mid-1990s, where they became infamous for their poor production values, repetitive plot devices, meandering and incomprehensible storylines, and stilted acting. Jim Vorel of &quot;Paste&quot; magazine characterized Francis as being the worst director of all-time, even suggesting that he may surpass Ed Wood in terms of ineptitude. Hallmarks of Francis&#x27; films include preoccupation with light aircraft and parachuting, coffee or cigarettes serving as props or centers of conversation and vigilante-style gunning down of suspects without trial at the films&#x27; conclusions.

<doc id="861599" wikidata="Q5467890" url="?curid=861599" title="Ford Panther platform">
<text>The Ford Panther platform was an automobile platform that was used by Ford Motor Company from the 1979 to 2012 model years. Following the downsizing of the General Motors B-bodies and C-bodies by two years, the Panther platform marked the end of production of full-sized American sedans. Originally slated for discontinuation during the early 1980s, the Panther architecture was used for 33 model years, making it one of the longest-produced platforms in North American automotive history.

Developed as a successor to the 1969 Ford chassis, the rear-wheel-drive, body-on-frame Panther platform was used by the Ford and Lincoln-Mercury brands. While produced exclusively as four-door sedans from 1992 to 2012, prior to its first update, the chassis underpinned two-door sedans and five-door station wagons. Throughout its entire production life, all Panther-platform vehicles were equipped with a V8 engine; the Modular V8 engine introduced in 1991 was the first overhead-cam V8 engine used in a mass-produced American vehicle.

Initially developed in response to the implementation of CAFE by the U.S. federal government, the Panther platform outlived its closest rival (the 1977–1996 GM B platform) by 15 years, with the 2012 Ford Crown Victoria becoming the final mass-produced passenger car designed with a separate frame. While body-on-frame construction is retained by pickup trucks and larger SUVs, unibody construction (or variants thereof) sees nearly universal use in passenger cars.

From 1978 to 1985, Ford and Mercury versions of the Panther platform were assembled in Hazelwood, Missouri (St. Louis Assembly). For the 1986 model year, production shifted to Talbotville, Ontario, Canada (St. Thomas Assembly). Lincoln versions were sourced from Wixom, Michigan (Wixom Assembly), until its 2007 closure; from 2008 to 2011, the Lincoln Town Car was assembled by St. Thomas Assembly. After a short production run of 2012 vehicles for export, St. Thomas Assembly produced the final Ford Crown Victoria on 15 September 2011, the final vehicle produced by the facility and the final vehicle of the Panther platform.

==Design overview==
The Panther platform utilized the body-on-frame construction with live rear-axle suspension. While commonplace during its late-1970s introduction, it is a design found almost exclusively in large SUVs and pickup trucks today. The durability resulting from the body-on-frame construction (which allows easier repair after minor collisions) and their relatively simple design make the Panther cars appealing as fleet vehicles, including police cars and taxicabs. The Lincoln Town Car appealed largely to livery services, and was the most commonly used limousine in North America, as it could easily be &quot;stretched&quot; by lengthening the frame without compromising chassis strength.

Although introduced in 1978, the Panther platform underwent major changes along the way. Across its design life, it was produced in three distinct generations:

*First generation (1979–1991): This generation was the only one to be produced in three body styles: four-door sedan, two-door coupe, and five-door station wagon. This was the only generation to use the Windsor V8 engine.
*Second generation (1990–2002): Extensive redesigns of exterior and interior; introduction of Modular V8 engine; and four-door sedan was only body style.
*Third generation (2003–2012): Frame and suspension redesigns and upgrades to improve handling. 2011 was the last model year for the North American market and for Lincoln-Mercury models. A limited number of 2012 Crown Victorias were built for the overseas market.

===First generation (1978–1991)===
For 1979, Ford introduced the Panther platform, downsizing the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis model ranges. Along with an extensive reduction in exterior footprint and weight, the Panther platform saw several other changes. For the first time, the LTD and Marquis shared a common wheelbase; with the exception of grilles and taillights, the two model lines shared nearly identical bodywork. As before, two-door, four-door, and station wagon bodies were offered.

For 1980, federal fuel-economy regulations forced the Lincoln Continental to adopt the Panther platform. While built on its own wheelbase and using its own bodywork, the Continental, Town Car, and Continental Mark VI used the same powertrain as the LTD and Marquis.

Following the introduction of the Panther platform, Ford underwent an extensive revision of both its full-size and mid-size model ranges in the early 1980s. For 1981, Lincoln made the Town Car and four-door Continental Mark VI its full-size model line to reduce its model overlap, with the Continental later becoming a mid-size sedan (based on the Fox platform); the two-door version of the Mark VI was replaced in 1984 by the Mark VII coupe. For 1983, the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis became mid-size sedans, replacing the Ford Granada and Mercury Cougar while the LTD Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis became distinct model lines, in an effort to move full-size model ranges upward in prestige.

The first generation of the Panther platform is the sole generation produced in multiple body styles. 1981 was the sole year for the Town Car coupe with the two-door version of the Mark VI ending production after 1983. After 1987, two-door Ford and Mercury sedans were discontinued due to low demand. After 1991, the Ford LTD Country Squire and Mercury Colony Park station wagons were discontinued.

;Changes

Outside of the shift of nameplates in the early 1980s, few fundamental changes were made to first-generation Panther-platform vehicles from 1979 to 1991. For 1980, Lincoln introduced the AOD 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission and fuel injection for the 5.0L V8, becoming available for Ford and Mercury in 1981 (Canadian Lincolns got fuel injection only in 1984).

For 1988, the LTD Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis underwent a minor revision to improve exterior aerodynamics. For 1990, the Panther platform received its first addition of SRS airbags. The Town Car (shifting to the second generation) was designed with dual airbags; the LTD Crown Victoria, Grand Marquis, and station wagons were fitted with driver-side airbags.

The first-generation Panther was also:
*The last American car with functional vent windows (option on 1989 Ford/Mercury)
*The last American-brand car available with a carbureted engine (351 cubic-inch V8; option on Grand Marquis, Crown Victoria wagon/police car through 1991)

===Second generation (1990–2002)===
The American automotive landscape had changed significantly throughout the 1980s, although Ford had left the Panther platform essentially unchanged. A combination of changing consumer tastes as well as increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards forced Ford to make significant changes to the Panther cars in order to keep them in production. Bucking industry trends of the time, Ford chose not to downsize it any further or to replace it entirely with a front-wheel-drive platform, opting instead for more aerodynamic bodystyling (which had been popularized by the smaller Taurus) and an all-new powertrain. As a result of changing market trends towards minivans and sport utility vehicles, one casualty of the redesign was the Country Squire and Colony Park station wagons; at the time, their de facto replacement was the Ford Aerostar.

In October 1989, Lincoln introduced the second-generation Town Car. In early 1991, the Crown Victoria (the LTD prefix disappeared) and Grand Marquis received total redesigns of their bodies for 1992. The Ford was restyled to have more of a family resemblance to the Ford Taurus, while the Mercury was styled as a more contemporary version of its predecessor (a formal family sedan).

;4.6-liter &quot;Modular&quot; V8
In 1991, the 4.6L SOHC Modular V8 debuted under the hood of the Lincoln Town Car. It was the replacement for both the 302 and 351 cubic-inch Windsor V8 engines; in 1992, it became available in the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis. Although the torque peak for the Modular V8 was 1,200 rpm higher than for the 302 V8, the 4.6L was available with up to 60 more horsepower (with optional dual exhaust).

;1998 upgrades
In 1997, Ford significantly upgraded the exterior designs of all three Panther platform cars. The Town Car received the most extensive changes with its entire body being restyled. To increase parts commonality between the two, the Crown Victoria was redesigned to share the rear roofline (and much of the exterior sheetmetal) with the Grand Marquis, which saw minor cosmetic changes itself. Underneath the sheetmetal, a Watt&#x27;s linkage was added to the rear suspension (still a live rear axle) in an effort to improve handling.

===Third generation (2003–2011)===
For 2003, Ford Chassis Engineer Trever Skilnick completely redesigned the frame of the Panther platform using a hydroformed steel frame and a bolt-in cast aluminum stressed member that held the powertrain. The front and rear suspension were also completely overhauled in an effort to improve handling; rack-and-pinion steering replaced the recirculating-ball design. While the sheetmetal of the Crown Victoria carried over, the Grand Marquis and Town Car both received updates to the exterior and interior in an effort to bring them in line with the rest of their respective product lineups. The &quot;Cast Aluminum #2&quot; frame crossmember won Casting of The Year for Tier 1 supplier CMI (Hayes Lemmerz), and the new chassis was reviewed favorably by journalist Dan Neil of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

For 2003, Mercury introduced the Marauder, a high-performance variant of the Grand Marquis. Designed in a similar fashion as the 1994–1996 Chevrolet Impala SS (with black also being its most commonly available paint color), it featured the engine of the Ford Mustang Mach 1. The Marauder sold poorly; it was dropped after 2004 after just over 11,000 were built.

==Models==
In total, twelve vehicle nameplates were produced under the Panther platform, with the Ford LTD Crown Victoria, Ford Crown Victoria, Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, Lincoln Town Car, and Continental Mark VI produced exclusively on the architecture.
==Variants==
*The Presidential State Car built for President George H. W. Bush is based upon a 1989 Lincoln Town Car.
**In line with its predecessors, the vehicle is equipped with armor plating, bulletproof glass, and undisclosed security modifications.
**To accommodate its higher weight, the vehicle was fitted with a 7.5L V8 (and E4OD transmission) from the F-250 -ton pickup truck.
*The 1993 Aston Martin Lagonda Vignale concept car used a modified Lincoln Town Car chassis and 4.6L V8.
*Two license-built variants of the Lincoln Town Car were assembled by the Chinese automaker Hongqi.
**During the mid-1990s, the Hongqi CA 7465 was a stretch limousine derived from the 1990–1997 Town Car; the front fascia was styled in line to the 1970s CA770. Approximately 100 were built. 
**The 1998–2005 Hongqi CA7460 (红旗CA7460) and Hongqi Qijian (红旗旗舰) (flagship) were luxury sedans produced primarily for government and military officials. After initial assembly by Ford in the United States, the cars were shipped to China for final bodywork.
*In 2002, Mercury introduced a Mercury Marauder concept car, serving as a preview of the 2003 production vehicle. While the production Marauder was a 4-door sedan, the concept car was a 2-door (topless) convertible. Beginning life as a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria, the concept car was the first full-size convertible from Ford Motor Company since 1971.
==Discontinuation==
Following the 2003 chassis redesign of the Panther platform, during most of the 2000s, Ford Motor Company began consideration of design efforts towards a rear-wheel-drive successor to the chassis architecture. Intended for release by the end of the 2000s, an all-new platform would be the first truly new rear-wheel-drive full-size chassis from Ford in three decades; another key objective was to consolidate the Panther chassis and the slightly smaller EA169 platform of Ford Australia (underpinning the Ford Falcon sedan and Ford Territory wagon, with the long-wheelbase Ford Fairlane/LTD nearly matching the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis in wheelbase). During the mid-2000s, Ford debuted several concept vehicles (Ford 427, Lincoln MKR, and Ford Interceptor), previewing potential designs of rear-wheel drive Ford and Lincoln-Mercury full-size sedans. While none of the concept vehicles reached production in their entirety, design elements of each vehicle appeared in multiple Ford and Lincoln sedans.

For the 2005 model year, Ford introduced its first front-wheel-drive full-size chassis, the Ford D3 platform. Derived from a Volvo chassis architecture, the D3 chassis underpinned the Ford Five Hundred and Mercury Montego. While the latter was sold alongside the larger Grand Marquis, the Five Hundred was phased in as a replacement for both the Ford Taurus and Crown Victoria. By 2007, the Crown Victoria was supported nearly entirely by fleet sales, outselling only the Ford GT in retail sales.

After the 2007 model year, Ford ended retail sales of the Crown Victoria, with the Five Hundred renamed as the Ford Taurus; further retail sales were adopted by Lincoln-Mercury. As part of The Way Forward, Lincoln Town Car production shifted from Wixom Assembly and was consolidated with Ford and Mercury at St. Thomas Assembly in Canada.

In January 2009, Ford announced that design efforts towards its global rear-wheel-drive platform were cancelled. The same year, Ford announced that 2011 marked the final year of the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, with production of a successor to follow for 2012. 2011 would slowly mark the phaseout of both Panther-platform production and of vehicle production at St. Thomas Assembly. On January 4, the final Grand Marquis was manufactured, becoming the final Mercury vehicle ever produced. During August, the final Lincoln Town Car was manufactured.

For the 2012 model year, all Crown Victorias were produced for export; as the vehicle was not produced with stability control, it was no longer legal for sale in the United States or Canada. A short run of Crown Victorias were produced for GCC export (Middle East); intended for export to Saudi Arabia, the final Ford Crown Victoria was manufactured on September 15, 2011, ending production at St. Thomas Assembly.

While the closure of the Mercury division would leave the Grand Marquis without a direct successor, by the end of production, Ford introduced functional replacements for the Crown Victoria/Police Interceptor and Lincoln Town Car (in the sixth-generation Ford Taurus/Police Interceptor Sedan and Lincoln MKS, respectively). With the exception of the Police Interceptor Sedan, sales of the Taurus and MKS shifted from a high dependence on fleet customers to a higher proportion of retail sales. The Lincoln Town Car name made its return for livery customers, with Lincoln developing a livery/limousine variant of the Lincoln MKT with the MKT Town Car name.

<text>Prince of Waterloo (Dutch: &quot;Prins van Waterloo&quot;, French: &quot;Prince de Waterloo&quot;) is a title in the Dutch and Belgian nobility, held by the Duke of Wellington. The title was created by King William I of the Netherlands for Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington as a victory title in recognition of defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Duke of Wellington and all his descendants along the male line belong to Dutch and Belgian nobility, in which all the descendant dukes carry the title of &quot;Prince of Waterloo&quot; with the style &quot;Serene Highness&quot; (). The rest of his family retain the Dutch honorific &quot;Jonkheer&quot; or &quot;Jonkvrouw&quot;.

==Estate of the prince==
In addition to this title, the Dutch king also granted Wellington of land and a yearly endowment of 20,000 guilders. To this day the Dukes of Wellington retain the title Prince of Waterloo, and enjoy an annual income of around £100,000 from the longstanding tenants occupying the land.

Owing to the establishment of the separate Kingdom of Belgium in 1831, the title (being Dutch) and the land (located in Belgium) became separated. After the Belgian independence the endowment was by the Treaty of London included in the public debt to be assumed by the new Kingdom of Belgium.

The land held by the Prince of Waterloo came under pressure from retired Belgian senator Jean-Emile Humblet in 2001. In 1817, the government in what is now Belgium struck a deal to pay the duke £1,600 a year in return for the proceeds of sales of timber which the duke wanted to clear from the forested land. Until 1988, successive dukes enjoyed this annual payment, but the then Prince of Waterloo, Valerian Wellesley, 8th Duke of Wellington, agreed to forgo the payment in exchange for outright ownership of of the to which he has rights. But some Belgian taxpayers, led by Humblet, claimed the deal did not reflect the value of the land and drew attention to the wider issues surrounding the original agreement, contending that Belgium was effectively coerced into accepting the terms of the original agreement, because it could not afford to offend Britain.

In 2009 a Member of Parliament from Vlaams Belang questioned the Minister of Finance, Didier Reynders about the grant. Reynders replied that this grant is part of the international obligations of Belgium under the Treaty of London and that he had no intention of reneging on the obligation, as all the Dukes have faithfully fulfilled their obligations.

==List of princes of Waterloo (1815–present)==
* Arthur Wellesley, 1st Prince of Waterloo (1769–1852) from 1815
* Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Prince of Waterloo (1807–1884) from 1852
* Henry Wellesley, 3rd Prince of Waterloo (1846–1900) from 1884
* Arthur Wellesley, 4th Prince of Waterloo (1849–1934) from 1900
* Arthur (Charlie) Wellesley, 5th Prince of Waterloo (1876–1941) from 1934
* Henry (Morney) Wellesley, 6th Prince of Waterloo (1912–1943) from 1941
* Gerald (Gerry) Wellesley, 7th Prince of Waterloo (1885–1972) from 1943
* Arthur Valerian Wellesley, 8th Prince of Waterloo (1915–2014) from 1972
* Arthur Charles Wellesley, 9th Prince of Waterloo (b. 1945) from 2014

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son &quot;Jonkheer&quot; Arthur Gerald Wellesley (b. 1978).

<text>AMD PowerNow! is AMD&#x27;s dynamic frequency scaling and power saving technology for laptop processors. The CPU&#x27;s clock speed and VCore are automatically decreased when the computer is under low load or idle, to save battery power, reduce heat and noise. The lifetime of the CPU is also extended because of reduced electromigration, which varies exponentially with temperature.

The technology is a concept similar to Intel&#x27;s SpeedStep technology. The adaptation of PowerNow! for AMD&#x27;s desktop CPUs is called Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet. Newer Opterons also use an adaptation of PowerNow! called &quot;Optimized Power Management.&quot;

AMD has supplied and supported drivers for its PowerNow! technology that work on Windows 98, ME, NT, and 2000.

==Processors supporting PowerNow!==
* K6-2+

<text>Condensins are large protein complexes that play a central role in chromosome assembly and segregation during mitosis and meiosis (Figure 1). Their subunits were originally identified as major components of mitotic chromosomes assembled in .

== Subunit composition ==

=== Eukaryotic types ===

Many cells possess two different types of condensin complexes, known as condensin I and condensin II, each of which is composed of five subunits (Figure 2). Condensins I and II share the same pair of core subunits, SMC2 and SMC4, both belonging to a large family of chromosomal ATPases, known as SMC proteins (SMC stands for Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes). Each of the complexes contains a distinct set of non-SMC regulatory subunits (a kleisin subunit and a pair of HEAT repeat subunits). Both complexes are large, having a total molecular mass of 650-700 kDa.

The core subunits condensins (SMC2 and SMC4) are conserved among all species that have been studied to date. The non-SMC subunits unique to condensin I are also conserved among eukaryotes, but the occurrence of the non-SMC subunits unique to condensin II is highly variable among species.

*For instance, the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; does not have the gene for the CAP-G2 subunit of condensin II. Other insect species often lack the genes for the CAP-D3 and/or CAP-H subunits, too, indicating that the non-SMC subunits unique to condensin II have been under high selection pressure during insect evolution.
*The nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; possesses both condensins I and II. This species is, however, unique in the sense that it has a third complex (closely related to condensin I) that participates in chromosome-wide gene regulation, i.e., dosage compensation. In this complex, known as condensin IDC, the authentic SMC4 subunit is replaced with its variant, DPY-27 (Figure 2).
*Some species, like (e.g., the budding yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;), lack all regulatory subunits unique to condensin II. On the other hand, the unicellular, primitive red alga &quot;Cyanidioschyzon merolae&quot;, whose genome size is comparable to those of the yeast, has both condensins I and II. Thus, there is no apparent relationship between the occurrence of condensin II and the size of eukaryotic genomes.
*The ciliate &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot; has condensin I only. Nevertheless, there are multiple paralogs for two of its regulatory subunits (CAP-D2 and CAP-H), and some of them specifically localize to either the macronucleus (responsible for gene expression) or the micronucleus (responsible for reproduction). Thus, this species has multiple condensin I complexes that have different regulatory subunits and display distinct nuclear localization. This is a very unique property that is not found in other species.

===Prokaryotic types===
 species also have condensin-like complexes that play an important role in chromosome (nucleoid) organization and segregation. The prokaryotic condensins can be classified into two types: SMC-ScpAB and MukBEF. Many and species have SMC-ScpAB, whereas a subgroup of eubacteria (known as Gammaproteobacteria) including &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; has MukBEF. ScpA and MukF belong to a family of proteins called &quot;kleisins&quot;, whereas ScpB and MukE have recently been classified into a new family of proteins named &quot;kite&quot;.

Despite highly divergent primary structures of their corresponding subunits between SMC-ScpAB and MukBEF, it is reasonable to consider that the two complexes play similar if not identical functions in prokaryotic chromosome organization and dynamics, based on their molecular architecture and their defective cellular phenotypes. Both complexes are therefore often called prokaryotic (or bacterial) condensins. Recent studies report the occurrence of a third complex related to MukBEF (termed MksBEF) in some bacterial species.

== Molecular mechanisms ==

===Molecular structures===

SMC dimers that act as the core subunits of condensins display a highly characteristic V-shape, each arm of which is composed of anti-parallel coiled-coils (Figure 3; see SMC proteins for details). The length of each coiled-coil arm reaches ~50 nm, which corresponds to the length of ~150 bp of (dsDNA). In eukaryotic condensin I and II complexes, a kleisin subunit bridges the two head domains of an SMC dimer, and binds to two HEAT repeat subunits (Figure 1).

Early studies elucidated the structure of parts of bacterial condensins, such as MukBEF and SMC-ScpA. In eukaryotic complexes, several structures of subcomplexes and subdomains have been reported, including the hinge and arm domains of an SMC2-SMC4 dimer, a CAP-G(ycg1)/CAP-H(brn1) subcomplex, and a CAP-D2(ycs4)/CAP-H(brn1) subcomplex. A recent cryo-EM study has shown that condensin undergoes large conformational changes that are coupled with ATP-binding and hydrolysis by its SMC subunits. On the other hand, fast-speed atomic force microscopy has demonstrated that the arms of an SMC dimer is far more flexible than was expected.

===Molecular activities===
Condensin I purified from is a DNA-stimulated ATPase and displays the ability to introduce positive into in an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner (positive activity). Similar activities have been detected in condensins from other organisms. The positive supercoiling activity is activated &quot;in vitro&quot; by Cdk1 , suggesting that it is likely one of the physiological activities directly involved in mitotic chromosome assembly. It is postulated that this activity of condensin I helps fold DNA and promotes topoisomerase II-mediated resolution of sister chromatids. Early also demonstrated in real time that condensin I is able to compact DNA in an ATP-hydrolysis dependent manner.

Most recently, have demonstrated that budding yeast condensin I is able to translocate along dsDNA ( activity) and to &quot;extrude&quot; DNA loops ( activity) in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. In the latter experiments, the activity of individual condensin complexes on DNA was visualized by real-time fluorescence imaging, revealing that condensin I indeed is a fast loop-extruding motor and that a single condensin I complex can extrude 1,500 bp of DNA per second in a strictly ATP-dependent manner. It has been proposed that condensin I anchors DNA between Ycg1-Brn1 subunits and pulls DNA asymmetrically to form large loops. Moreover, it has been shown that condensin complexes can traverse each other, forming dynamic loop structures and changing their sizes.

It is unknown how condensins might act on . Recent development of a reconstitution system has identified the histone chaperone as an essential component of condensin I-mediated chromosome assembly &quot;in vitro&quot;, providing an important clue to this problem. It has also been shown that condensins can assemble chromosome-like structures in cell-free extracts even under the condition where nucleosome assembly is largely suppressed. This observation indicates that condensins can work at least in part on non-nucleosomal DNA in a physiological setting.

How similar and how different are the molecular activities of condensin I and condensin II? Both share two SMC subunits, but each has three unique non-SMC subunits (Figure 2). A fine-tuned balance between the actions of these non-SMC subunits could determine the differences in the rate of loop extrusion and the activity of mitotic chromosome assembly of the two complexes. By introducing different mutations, it is possible to convert condensin I into a complex with condensin II-like activities and vice versa.

===Mathematical modeling===
Several attempts on mathematical modeling and computer simulation of mitotic chromosome assembly, based on molecular activities of condensins, have been reported. Representative ones include modeling based on loop extrusion, stochastic pairwise contacts and a combination of looping and inter-condensin attractions.

==Functions in chromosome assembly and segregation==
===Mitosis===
In human tissue culture cells, the two condensin complexes are regulated differently during the cell cycle (Figure 4). Condensin II is present within the cell nucleus during interphase and participates in an early stage of chromosome condensation within the prophase nucleus. On the other hand, condensin I is present in the cytoplasm during interphase, and gains access to chromosomes only after the nuclear envelope breaks down (NEBD) at the end of prophase. During prometaphase and metaphase, condensin I and condensin II cooperate to assemble rod-shaped chromosomes, in which two sister chromatids are fully resolved. Such differential dynamics of the two complexes is observed in , mouse oocytes, and neural stem cells, indicating that it is part of a fundamental regulatory mechanism conserved among different organisms and cell types. It is most likely that this mechanism ensures the ordered action of the two complexes, namely, condensin II first and condensin I later.

On metaphase chromosomes, condensins I and II are both enriched in the central axis in a non-overlapping fashion (Figure 5). Depletion experiments &quot;in vivo&quot; and immunodepletion experiments in demonstrate that the two complexes have distinct functions in assembling metaphase chromosomes. Cells deficient in condensin functions are not arrested at a specific stage of cell cycle, displaying chromosome segregation defects (i.e., anaphase bridges) and progressing through abnormal cytokinesis.

The relative contribution of condensins I and II to mitosis varies among different eukaryotic species. For instance, each of condensins I and II plays an essential role in embryonic development in mice. They have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions during the mitotic cell cycle. On the other hand, condensin II is non-essential for mitosis in the primitive alga &quot;C. merolae&quot; and the land plant &quot;A. thaliana&quot;. Curiously, condensin II plays a dominant role over condensin I in the &quot;C. elegans&quot; early embryos. This peculiarity could be due to the fact that &quot;C. elegans&quot; has a specialized chromosome structure known as holocentric chromosomes. Fungi, such as &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;S. pombe&quot; have no condensin II from the first. These differences among eukaryotic species provide important implications in the evolution of chromosome architecture (see the section of &quot;Evolutionary implications&quot; below).

It has recently become possible that cell cycle-dependent structural changes of chromosomes are monitored by a genomics-based method known as Hi-C (High-throughput ). The impact of condensin deficiency on chromosome conformation has been addressed in budding yeast, fission yeast, and the chicken DT40 cells. The outcome of these studies strongly supports the notion that condensins play crucial roles in mitotic chromosome assembly and that condensin I and II have distinct functions in this process. Moreover, quantitative imaging analyses allow researchers to count the number of condensin complexes present on human metaphase chromosomes.

===Meiosis===
Condensins also play important roles in chromosome assembly and segregation in meiosis. Genetic studies have been reported in &quot;S. cerevisiae,&quot; &quot;D. melanogaster,&quot; and &quot;C. elegans&quot;. In mice, requirements for condensin subunits in meiosis have been addressed by antibody-mediated blocking experiments and conditional gene knockout analyses. In mammalian meiosis I, the functional contribution of condensin II appears bigger than that of condensin I. As has been shown in mitosis, however, the two condensin complexes have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions, too, in meiosis. Unlike cohesin, no meiosis-specific subunits of condensins have been identified so far.

==Chromosomal functions outside of mitosis or meiosis==
Recent studies have shown that condensins participate in a wide variety of chromosome functions outside of mitosis or meiosis.
*In budding yeast, condensin I (the sole condensin in this organism) is involved in copy number regulation of the rDNA repeat as well as in clustering of the tRNA genes. 
*In fission yeast, condensin I is involved in the regulation of and clustering of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III.
*In &quot;C. elegans&quot;, a third condensin complex (condensin IDC) related to condensin I regulates higher-order structure of X chromosomes as a major regulator of dosage compensation.
*In &quot;D. melanogaster&quot;, condensin II subunits contribute to the dissolution of and the formation of chromosome territories in ovarian . Evidence is available that they negatively regulate transvection in diploid cells. It has also been reported that condensin I components are required to ensure correct gene expression in following cell-cycle exit.
*In &quot;A. thaliana&quot;, condensin II is essential for tolerance of excess boron stress, possibly by alleviating DNA damage. 
*In mammalian cells, it is likely that condensin II is involved in the regulation of interphase chromosome architecture and function. For instance, in human cells, condensin II participates in the initiation of sister chromatid resolution during S phase, long time before mitotic prophase when sister chromatids become cytologically visible.
*In mouse interphase nuclei, pericentromeric heterochromatin on different chromosomes associates with each other, forming a large structure known as chromocenters. Cells deficient in condensin II, but not in condensin I, display hyperclustering of chromocenters, indicating that condensin II has a specific role in suppressing chromocenter clustering. 
*Whilst early studies suggested the possibility that condensins may directly participate in regulating gene expression, some recent studies argue against this hypothesis.
*Mutants of the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; were obtained that had a temperature sensitive and/or DNA damage sensitive phenotype. Some of these mutants were defective in the HEAT subunits of condensin indicating that the HEAT subunits are required for DNA repair.

==Posttranslational modifications and cell cycle regulation==
Condensin subunits are subject to various post-translational modifications in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Among these, phosphorylation in mitosis is the best studied.

Phosphorylation by Cdk1 is essential for condensin I&#x27;s supercoiling activity and chromosome assembly activity in vitro. However, the target subunits and sites (and number) of phosphorylation essential for activation are not known. S/TP sequences, the primary targets of Cdk1, tend to be enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) located at the ends of condensin subunits, but their distribution and contribution to the regulation of condensin vary widely among different species. For example, in fission yeast, phosphorylation of the N-terminus of the SMC4 subunit regulates nuclear translocation of condensin during mitosis. In budding yeast, condensin localizes to the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, and phosphorylation of the N-terminus of the SMC4 subunit is involved in the regulation of chromosome association dynamics of condensin. In vertebrates, it has been proposed that N-terminal phosphorylation of the CAP-H subunit promotes mitosis-specific loading of condensin I. In addition to Cdk1, positive regulation by Aurora B and Polo and negative regulation by CK2 (casein kinase 2) have been reported.

Several mitotic kinases, Cdk1, polo and Mps1 are involved in condensin II regulation. It has been shown that the C-terminal tail of the CAP-D3 subunit is a major target for Cdk1 phosphorylation in the human condensin II complex. Moreover, CAP-D3 has been identified as a substrate of the protein phosphatase PP2A-B55.

It has been reported that the CAP-H2 subunit of condensin II is degraded in Drosophila through the action of the SCFSlimb ubiquitin ligase.

==Relevance to diseases==
It was demonstrated that MCPH1, one of the proteins responsible for human primary microcephaly, has the ability to negatively regulate condensin II. In &quot;mcph1&quot; patient cells, condensin II (but not condensin I) is hyperactivated, leading to premature chromosome condensation in G2 phase (i.e., before entering mitosis). There is no evidence, however, that misregulation of condensin II is directly related to the etiology of &quot;mcph1&quot; microcephaly. More recently, it has been reported that mutations in condensin I or II subunits cause microcephaly in humans. In mice, mutations in condensin II subunits cause specific defects in T cell development, leading to T cell lymphoma. It is interesting to note that cell types with specialized cell division modes, such as and , are particularly susceptible to mutations in condensin subunits.

==Evolutionary implications==
Prokaryotes have primitive types of condensins, indicating that the evolutionary origin of condensins precede that of histones. The fact that condensins I and II are widely conserved among extant eukaryotic species strongly implicates that the last eukaryotic common ancestor () had both complexes. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that some species such as fungi have lost condensin II during evolution.

Then why do many have two different condensin complexes? As discussed above, the relative contribution of condensins I and II to mitosis varies among different organisms. They play equally important roles in mammalian mitosis, whereas condensin I has a predominant role over condensin II in many other species. In those species, condensin II might have been adapted for various non-essential functions other than mitosis. Although there is no apparent relationship between the occurrence of condensin II and the size of genomes, it seems that the functional contribution of condensin II becomes big as the genome size increases. A recent, comprehensive Hi-C study argues from an evolutionary point of view that condensin II acts as a determinant that converts post-mitotic Rabl configurations into interphase chromosome territories. The relative contribution of the two condensin complexes to mitotic chromosome architecture also change during development, making an impact on the morphology of mitotic chromosomes. Thus, the balancing act of condensins I and II is apparently fine-tuned in both evolution and development.

== Relatives ==
Eukaryotic cells have two additional classes of SMC protein complexes. Cohesin contains SMC1 and SMC3 and is involved in sister chromatid cohesion. The SMC5/6 complex contains SMC5 and SMC6 and is implicated in recombinational repair.

<text>The meadow brown (Maniola jurtina) is a butterfly found in the Palearctic realm. Its range includes Europe south of 62°N, Russia eastwards to the Urals, Asia Minor, Iraq, Iran, North Africa and the Canary Islands. The larvae feed on grasses.

==Description==
There is marked sexual dimorphism in this species. The upperside of the male is uniformly light brown with a black ocellus centered white at the apex of the forewing, while the female has a tawny patch more or less extended around this ocella. The underside forewing is ochre-colored bordered with dark beige with the same ocelli at the apex in the male, while the hindwing is greyish to brown with a more or less orange band in the female. The males are also much more active and range far about, while females fly less and often may not move away from the area where they grew up.

==Description in Seitz==
Above dark brown: the apical ocellus minutely centred with white, being in the male bordered with dull dark yellow, and standing in the female in an ochre-yellow half band, which becomes narrower behind and does not reach the hindmargin. The upperside of the live male has often a splendid metallic gloss and bears a broad scent-patch below the cell. Underside of hindwing in the male dark brown, with a hardly perceptible middle band, in the female grey-brown, with a broad, pale, proximally golden-brown-bordered curved band. In several forms throughout Europe Apart from the forms characterized by the disappearance of ocelli or the appearance of accessory there are firstly the albinos which have received in which the blackish ground-colour is replaced by dirty white, while the reddish yellow halfband has remained as such. In others the reddish yellow halfband on the forewing of the female is pale to ivory-white. Specimens have been described in which the band of the male is very prominent on a silky dust-grey upperside. Aberration &quot;cinerea&quot; has a bluish gloss on the dark upperside; the hindwing is strongly dentate, tinged with pink on the underside, and bears two eye-dots In hot summers one not seldom meets with specimens in which the reddish yellow colour has increased, this colour being represented by a yellowish red dusting on the apical area in the male and in the female by a yellowish red area in the disc of the hindwing.[Subspecies] &quot;hispulla&quot; Hbn. (47b) from Southern Europe, has these characteristics in a still more pronounced degree, and is, besides, generally broader-winged than the nymotypical jurtina — &quot;fortunata&quot; Alph. (47 c) is a yet paler form. The live male has in its apical area a magnificent golden gloss on a deep black ground, in the female the ground-colour above is reduced by the extension of the reddish yellow. Moreover, the form is much larger and the basal area of the hindwing is so darkened below that the light discal band contrasts vividly.

A variable number of smaller eyespots are usually found on the hindwing undersides. These may number up to twelve per butterfly, with up to six on each wing, but sometimes none. The factors that govern polymorphism in this trait are not resolved, although a number of theories have been proposed (Stevens 2005). On the other hand, the evolutionary significance of the upperwing eyespots is more obvious: The more active males have a markedly more cryptic upperside pattern, whereas the females have more opportunity to present their eyespots in a sudden display of colors and patterns that presumably startle predators so the butterfly has a better chance of escaping. Some specimens are bi-pupilled.


==Similar species==
Similar species are the gatekeeper (which prefers to rest with its wings open) and the small heath (which is smaller). More similar are the dusky meadow brown (&quot;Hyponephele lycaon&quot; smaller, male androconial area obliquely directed and divided into three parts by veins Cu1 and Cu2, female with two ochreous ringed eye-spots) is otherwise very similar, &quot;Pyronia janiroides&quot;, &quot;Hyponephele moroccana&quot;, &quot;Hyponephele lycaon&quot; and &quot;Hyponephele lupina&quot;. Most problematic is the cryptic species complex of &quot;Maniola&quot; (&quot;Maniola telmessia&quot;, &quot;Maniola nurag&quot;, &quot;Maniola chia&quot;, &quot;Maniola halicarnassus&quot; and &quot;Maniola cypricola&quot;).

==Description of egg, larva and pupa==
The egg, laid on a blade of grass as shown (Plate 85), is upright and ribbed; the top is flattened, with an impressed ring thereon. Color, whitish green inclining to brownish yellow as it matures, and marked with purplish brown. The caterpillar is bright green, clothed with short whitish hairs; there is a darker line down the back, and a diffused white stripe on each side above the reddish spiracles; the anal points are white. Head rather darker green, hairy. The chrysalis is pale green, marked with brownish on the wing covers, the thorax is spotted with blackish, and the points on the body are brownish. Suspended, and with the old skin attached. (South, 1906).

==Food plants==
Recorded larval food plants include rough meadow grass (&quot;Poa trivialis&quot;), smooth meadow grass (&quot;Poa pratensis&quot;), &quot;Festuca&quot; species, bents (&quot;Agrostis&quot; species), and cock&#x27;s-foot (&quot;Dactylis glomerata&quot;), false brome (&quot;Brachypodium sylvaticum&quot;), downy oat-grass and &quot;Helictotrichon pubescens&quot;. Less specific records of &quot;Poa&quot;, &quot;Bromus&quot;, &quot;Festuca&quot;, &quot;Milium&quot;, &quot;Brachypodium&quot;, &quot;Lolium&quot;, &quot;Avena&quot;, &quot;Alopecurus&quot; and &quot;Anthoxanthum&quot;.

Adults feed on nectar from a wide spectrum of plants including &quot;Centaurea&quot;, &quot;Cirsium&quot;, &quot;Leontodon&quot;, &quot;Erica&quot;, &quot;Rubus&quot;, &quot;Heracleum&quot;, &quot;Eupatorium&quot;, 
(&quot;sensu lato&quot;) &quot;Origanum&quot;, &quot;Senecio&quot;, &quot;Scabiosa&quot;, &quot;Succisa&quot;, &quot;Ligustrum&quot; and &quot;Filipendula&quot;.

==Flight time==
The meadow brown is univoltine (one generation per year) and adults emerge over a long period (spring, summer and autumn). Some individuals have a short larval development time and produce late adults. This is genetically controlled.

==Habitat==
Because of the vast distribution habitats are hard to define but broadly are forest edge, forest-steppe and meadow steppe habitats up to 2,000 m above sea level, cultivated lands (meadow, forest plantations, parks and orchards).

<doc id="861627" wikidata="Q11730" url="?curid=861627" title="Otto Bauer">
<text>Otto Bauer (5 September 1881 – 4 July 1938) was one of the founders and leading thinkers of the left-socialist Austromarxists who sought a middle ground between social democracy and revolutionary socialism. He was a member of the Austrian Parliament from 1907 to 1934, deputy party leader of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP) from 1918 to 1934, and Foreign Minister of the Republic of German-Austria in 1918 and 1919. In the latter position he worked unsuccessfully to bring about the unification of Austria and the Weimar Republic. His opposition to the SDAP joining coalition governments after it lost its leading position in Parliament in 1920 and his practice of advising the party to wait for the proper historical circumstances before taking action were criticized by some for facilitating Austria&#x27;s move from democracy to fascism in the 1930s. When the SDAP was outlawed by Austrofascist Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg in 1934, Bauer went into exile where he continued to work for Austrian socialism until his death.

== Education and military training ==
Otto Bauer was born in Vienna, son of the wealthy, politically liberal Jewish textile manufacturer Philipp (Filipp) Bauer and Katharina (Käthe) Bauer, née Gerber. He completed elementary school in Vienna, and high school in Vienna, Meran and Reichenberg (the latter two at the time part of Austria-Hungary). In addition to German, he spoke English, French and, after his years as a prisoner of war, Russian. To fulfill his compulsory military duty, he enlisted as a one-year volunteer with the 3rd Regiment of the Tyrolean Rifle Regiment in 1902, completed his active military service after passing the reserve officer exam, and was transferred as a reservist to the Infantry Regiment Frederik VIII King of Denmark, No. 75. He went on to study law at the University of Vienna and received his doctorate in 1906. His political interests were reflected in his university studies, where in addition to law, history, languages and philosophy, he enrolled in classes in national economics and sociology.

In 1900 Bauer began to be politically active in the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party, as the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) was called before 1945, and became a member of the Free Association of Socialist Students. At the university he met the somewhat older Socialist Party members Max Adler, Rudolf Hilferding (who later became a minister of finance in the Weimar Republic) and Karl Renner, who was Chancellor of Austria immediately after both the First and Second World Wars. With them he founded the association (&#x27;Future&#x27;) as a school for Viennese workers that was the nucleus for Austromarxism. He attracted attention when in 1907, at only 26 years old, he submitted the 600-page work (&#x27;The Nationality Question and Social Democracy&#x27;). In it he attempted to apply the principles of cultural autonomy to find a constructive solution to the problem of nationality, which was particularly important to the Austro-Hungarian Empire because of its many nationalities.

== Political career ==

=== Empire and World War I (1907–1918) ===

==== Member of Parliament ====

In the 1907 legislative election, the House of Deputies () of the Imperial Council () was elected for the first time under universal and equal male suffrage. The SDAP, which had been represented in Parliament for the first time in 1897 with 14 deputies, won 87 seats, the second strongest showing behind the conservative Christian Social Party. Otto Bauer entered the House of Deputies in the 1907 election and at the request of party leader Victor Adler became secretary of the Club of Social Democratic Deputies in the Reichsrat. In the years before World War I, Adler and the Social Democrats generally supported the existing state order.

In 1907 Bauer co-founded and until 1914 was editor of the Social Democratic monthly &quot;Der Kampf&quot; (&#x27;The Struggle&#x27;), of which he remained co-editor until 1934. From 1912 to 1914 he was also a member of the editorial board of the daily &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; (&#x27;Workers&#x27; Newspaper&#x27;), the party&#x27;s central journalistic voice. During his career as a journalist, Bauer wrote some 4,000 newspaper articles, and among the Social Democrats he proved himself to be an impressive speaker and convincing debater. The historian Friedrich Heer spoke of Bauer&#x27;s &quot;marriage of German and Jewish pathos&quot;.

In 1914 Bauer met and fell in love with (&quot;née&quot; Gumplowicz), a married academic and journalist who was ten years his senior. After she divorced her husband in 1920, the two were married in the Stadttempel, Vienna&#x27;s main synagogue; a civil marriage was not legally possible at the time.

==== War service and captivity ====
In August 1914, at the beginning of World War I, Bauer was drafted as a reserve lieutenant of infantry. He took part as a platoon commander in the heavy fighting at Grodek (now Horodok, Ukraine), saved his company from being wiped out at the battle of Szysaki, for which he was awarded the Military Cross of Merit 3rd Class, and on 23 November 1914 was taken prisoner of war by the Russians during a &quot;spirited&quot; attack that he had ordered. As he wrote to fellow Social Democrat Karl Seitz, who sent him money through friends in Stockholm, he was able to work on a comprehensive theoretical treatise during his imprisonment in Siberia. He was also allowed to read Russian, English, and French newspapers due to his privileges as an officer, and he did not have to engage in physical labor.

As a result of intervention by the SDAP, Bauer was able to return to Vienna as an exchange invalid in September 1917, less than two months before the outbreak of the October Revolution in Russia. In February 1918 he was appointed first lieutenant in the reserves and in March placed on leave from active military service in order to work on the . He was formally in army service until 31 October 1918. His contacts with Menshevik functionaries while a prisoner of war had made him a staunch supporter of the &quot;Marxist center&quot; that the Mensheviks represented. In Austria, however, his views placed him among the left (Marxist) wing of the SDAP.

==== Rise to leadership in the SDAP ====

The SDAP&#x27;s left wing had gained in importance at the party congress in 1917 because the plight of the civilian population that was going hungry due to wartime food shortages. The assassination in the fall of 1916 of the unpopular imperial Minister President Karl von Stürgkh by Friedrich Adler, son of SDAP chairman Victor Adler, also spurred on the opponents of &quot;Burgfriedenspolitik&quot;, a political truce under which the parliamentary parties refrained from challenging the Empire&#x27;s war policy. Following Stürgkh&#x27;s assassination, the SDAP began increasingly to distance itself from the government&#x27;s wartime course. The Russian October Revolution once again increased the importance of the left wing when it was assigned the task of preventing Austrian workers from moving over to the Bolsheviks.

After Victor Adler&#x27;s death on 11 November 1918, the 37-year-old Otto Bauer, seen as the young and dynamic leader of the SDAP&#x27;s left wing, was brought into the party&#x27;s leadership. As a counterweight, the leader of the SDAP&#x27;s right wing, Karl Renner, was given the position of Chancellor on 30 October 1918 in the first government of the new state of German-Austria, which declared itself both a republic and part of the German Republic on 12 November 1918.

=== Post-war (1918–1934) ===

==== Foreign Minister and the question of union with Germany ====
On 12 November 1918 the party proposed that Bauer succeed Viktor Adler as Foreign Minister of German-Austria. He was then appointed to the position by the State Council (). In the election for the Constituent National Assembly on 16 February 1919, the SDAP won the largest percent of the vote (40.76%) and entered into a coalition with the Christian Social Party, which had come in ahead of the SDAP in the previous (1907) election. 

After the end of the war, a union () between German-Austria, including German Bohemia, and Germany seemed a self-evident goal to many, especially urban Social Democrats who had seen their German political counterparts become the governing party in the Weimar Republic. Like other nationalities of the fallen monarchy, Austrian Germans claimed the right of national self-determination. In addition, the Austrian Social Democrats were expecting to see a socialist revolution take place in Germany. Otto Bauer was one of the most outspoken proponents of the belief in a future with Germany.

At the SDAP party congress on 31 October and 1 November 1918, Bauer stated that from the national standpoint as (cultural) Germans and from the international standpoint as Social Democrats, they must demand union with Germany. In Parliament he said that opponents of Austrian unification with Germany were high traitors to the nation. The Provisional National Assembly voted in favor of the union on 12 November 1918, and on 25 December Bauer addressed a to the victorious powers saying that union with Germany was the only and correct way forward.

He conducted confidential unification negotiations from 27 February to 2 March 1919 with German Foreign Minister Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, whose representatives in Austria warned internally against joining Germany with the small bankrupt state. In mid-April Bauer was advised by a British officer in Vienna to avoid the subject of unification as much as possible in the peace negotiations. Bauer did not inform his government colleagues of the warning until weeks later and initially nominated Franz Klein, who was known to be an ardent supporter of unification, as head of the delegation to the peace talks at St. Germain. As word of the British warning belatedly spread, the delegation leadership was transferred to Karl Renner before negotiations began.

On 7 May 1919 the Allies of World War I handed the German delegation at Versailles the draft of the peace treaty, which revealed that the victors would not permit Austria to unite with Germany. Since his policy of unification was considered to have failed, Bauer resigned from the government on 26 July 1919, and Chancellor Renner took over the Foreign Office. Bauer nevertheless remained a proponent of unification until 1933, stating later that &quot;it was clear to every Social Democrat and every worker in Austria that we wanted unification with the German Republic, not Hitler&#x27;s penal colony.&quot;

==== Early party work ====
From March to October 1919 Bauer served with Ignaz Seipel of the Christian Socialists on the socialization commission appointed by Parliament. Its most important result was the draft of the Works Councils Act passed by the National Assembly on 15 May 1919. The move towards socializing private enterprises, however, was quickly halted due to the divergent views of the coalition partners.

Bauer and the leaders of the Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils, Julius Deutsch and Friedrich Adler (the assassin of Karl von Stürgkh had been released from custody by the Emperor in the last days of the war) succeeded in keeping the workers in line with the party and stopping the communist putsch attempts of 12 November 1918 and 14 June 1919. His successes were also due to the fact that in the course of the post-war economic boom that lasted for about two years, the revolutionary fervor of the working class had diminished considerably. It was a period during which workers could find employment, earn a decent wage, pay hardly any rent, and in what had become known as &quot;Red Vienna&quot;, were entitled to the first social benefits offered under its SDAP mayor Jakob Reumann.

==== SDAP in opposition ====
The postwar economic boom, which was based primarily on inflationary speculation, began to slow in 1920. Many working people and retirees fell into poverty due to the effects of high inflation. The dissatisfaction over living standards and the renewed solidarity among conservatives were reflected in the election results of 17 October 1920. The SDAP lost its relative majority, with the Christian Socialists 6 percentage points ahead (42% to 36%). The SDAP, at Bauer&#x27;s insistence, left the coalition with the Christian Socialists. One result of this was that Secretary of the Army Julius Deutsch had to relinquish control of the Austrian Armed Forces, which 14 years later was to play a decisive role in the suppression of social democracy. The Social Democrats did not again participate in a government at the federal level until 1945.

The breaking of the coalition with the Christian Socialists and its decades-long effects prompted the following comment from Karl Renner, who had spoken out against the move in the party executive committee:
Otto Bauer, by his rigid attitude, by the weight of his personality ... made it impossible for the Social Democrats to enter the coalition except at the price of a party split ... Thus the experiment had the &#x27;fortunate&#x27; outcome of declaring the republic, which had been founded primarily by the Social Democratic working class as a democratic republic, a purely bourgeois republic.

==== Linz Program ====

In 1926 the SDAP adopted a new party program to replace the one that had been adopted in 1901. The original push for a new platform had come from Otto Bauer, who was also one of the main participants in its development. He presented it to the party membership in a fiery speech at the SDAP&#x27;s 1926 convention in Linz, from which the program took its name. The program contained features from Marxism and the ideology of class conflict, and it provided the theoretical basis for political confrontation with the Christian Social Party and the paramilitary Heimwehr, which at the time were becoming increasingly clerical-fascist. It criticized the fact that the bourgeoisie, through economic power and tradition, still held sway over social institutions. Possible cooperation with them was described as a temporary condition at best, since class antagonisms were irreversible. Democracy was to be placed in the service of labor in order to expropriate big capital and large landed properties and to transfer the means of production and exchange to the &quot;common property of the whole people&quot;.

Bauer&#x27;s revolutionary rhetoric, which used Marxist ideas to define the transition from capitalism to socialism as an inevitable historical necessity, largely overshadowed the party&#x27;s concrete demands. The SDAP&#x27;s opponents were able to use quotations from the program to warn against Bolshevism. Bauer distanced himself from the excesses, but only hesitantly from the ideas of the Bolsheviks, and professed the hope that &quot;if ... Russian Bolshevism should succeed ... and the people achieve prosperity ..., then the idea of socialism would gain irresistible appeal throughout the world. Then capitalism&#x27;s last hour would toll.&quot;

The politics of Social Democracy, especially in Red Vienna, where party leader Karl Seitz was mayor, was reform-oriented and democratic. Bruno Kreisky, who was to become the Social Democratic Chancellor of Austria from 1970 to 1983, spoke of a terrible verbal mistake: &quot;[The] phrase &#x27;dictatorship of the proletariat&#x27; stuck to the party like a brand. ... It was a dangerous formulation and contrary to everything that could be read in the program.&quot;

==== Collapse of Austrian democracy ====
Bauer, with the approval of Seitz and Renner, rejected coalition offers by the Christian Socialist Chancellors Ignaz Seipel in 1931 and Engelbert Dollfuss in 1932. It soon came to be considered a fatal mistake. Kreisky wrote, &quot;In my opinion, it was the last chance to save Austrian democracy.&quot;

On 4 March 1933 Bauer and Seitz sent party secretary Adolf Schärf to Karl Renner with the advice that he resign as first president of the National Council, due to what came to be known the rules of procedure crisis. Following the resignations on the same day of both the Christian Socialist second president and the Greater German People&#x27;s Party third president, Chancellor Dollfuss two days later declared the elimination of Parliament and prevented it from reconvening. Although it was mandatory in the SDAP&#x27;s party statutes for a general strike to be called if Parliament was not allowed to sit, no strike took place.

Bauer did not allow himself to be pushed into action until the operational plans of the &quot;Republikanischer Schutzbund&quot; (&#x27;Republican Protection League&#x27;) – the SDAP&#x27;s paramilitary arm established in 1923 to counter the right-wing Heimwehr – were already in the hands of the Dollfuss government and it had cleared out a number of the Schutzbund&#x27;s weapons caches. In early February 1934, Theodor Körner, who had been a general during World War I and was at the time Chairman of the Austrian Parliament&#x27;s upper house, was asked at the last minute to take command of the Schutzbund. After examining the Schutzbund structure in six Viennese districts, he implored Bauer on 11 February not to let it come to a clash with the government and its forces under any circumstances. He thought that the Schutzbund and the SDAP would certainly lose.

== Exile (1934–1938) ==

=== Brno ===
In February 1934 a series of skirmishes known as the February Uprising broke out between Austrian government forces and the Schutzbund. It ended in a socialist defeat and the outlawing of the SDAP. On the second day of the four-day uprising, Bauer, Julius Deutsch and other members of the SDAP leadership fled to Czechoslovakia. When he arrived in exile in Brno, he accepted the consequences of the failure of his plans and the criticism he faced from his own ranks by announcing that he would continue to be available to the party as an advisor, journalist and administrator of the party&#x27;s saved funds, but that he himself would no longer assume any leadership positions.

He supported the Social Democratic underground with his Foreign Office of the Austrian Social Democrats (, or ALÖS) through both his words and his actions. His work helped establish the Revolutionary Socialists of Austria under Joseph Buttinger as the successor to the SDAP in 1935. It took the organizational form of a conspiratorial cadre party.

=== Brussels and Paris ===
In 1938, with Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria, Bauer emigrated to Brussels, where at the end of March his foreign office merged with the leadership of the Revolutionary Socialists, which had fled Austria, to form the Foreign Mission of the Austrian Socialists (, or AVOES). Joseph Buttinger led AVOES, while Bauer was a prominent member and the editor of the newspaper (&#x27;The Socialist Struggle&#x27;).

Bauer always praised Germany as a &quot;haven of spirit and progress&quot;. In his political testament written in Paris in 1938, he again spoke out in favor of an all-German revolution (including Austria), since he did not believe that a socialist revolution in Austria alone was feasible. When Karl Renner declared in favor of the Anschluss with Germany because he thought that Nazism would be temporary and no worse than Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg&#x27;s authoritarian system, Bauer thought that he was correct. Kreisky noted that Bauer always considered and felt himself to be German.

On 5 July 1938, at the age of 56, Otto Bauer succumbed to a heart attack in Paris. He was buried in the Père Lachaise cemetery opposite the monument to the fighters of the Paris Commune of 1871. In 1948 his urn was brought to Vienna and on 12 November 1950 reburied in an honorary grave at the Vienna Central Cemetery next to those of Victor Adler and Karl Seitz.

== Political philosophy == 
=== General analytic themes ===

Otto Bauer&#x27;s ideas were characterized by a mixture of objective analysis, Marxism and other era-specific influences:

* cultural-idealist German nationalism, which clearly influenced Bauer&#x27;s writings on the nationality question and his attitude toward the unification problem in 1919
* a certain fiscal orthodoxy, which made Bauer very skeptical of measures to create jobs during the Great Depression
* the Marxist theme of the &quot;objective conditions&quot; that decisively shape the scope for political action, which was related to a certain &#x27;wait and see&#x27; attitude on his part that was personally tinged and that manifested itself in a mixture of revolutionary rhetoric and a latent awareness of weakness

Bauer provided political analyses in many areas, such as his insight that the world was between two world wars at the end of the 1930s and his reflections on rationalization and faulty rationalization. His analyses were not, however, followed by guidance for political action. 

=== Concept of revolution ===
Otto Bauer&#x27;s concept of revolution bore distinctly reformist features. In 1928 he wrote:
&quot;It is not the great geological catastrophe that has reshaped the world; no, it is the small revolutions in the imperceptible, in the atoms that can no longer be studied even with a microscope, that change the world, that produce the force that then in one day is released in a geological catastrophe. The small, the imperceptible, what we call detail work, that is the truly revolutionary.&quot;
A problem with this line of argument, as for example in the Linz Program, was that the SDAP&#x27;s opponents could point to the emotive word &#x27;revolution&#x27;. As early as the 1920s, the established goal of political opponents was to avoid becoming victims of (Austro)Marxist radical reforms.

=== Justification of the SDAP&#x27;s &#x27;wait and see&#x27; approach ===
In terms of historical materialism and in light of the dire economic conditions in Austria in the 1920s, Bauer was convinced that the objective conditions for revolution merely had to be allowed to mature, since it was certain that they would come about. The party&#x27;s waiting was therefore to be seen as an appropriate &quot;revolutionary pause&quot;, because any shared responsibility involving dubious partnerships (meaning coalition offers by the Christian Socialists) would only lead to delaying the collapse of the prevailing capitalist order.

What Bauer was waiting for was an absolute majority of votes in the country, which he was sure would sooner or later come to the SDAP. Then the achievements of &quot;Red Vienna&quot;, from which Bauer drew a good part of his strength and confidence, would serve not as the ultimate goal, but rather as the basis for further development toward a socialization of the economy that would be nearly impossible to reverse.

With his visions of the widespread upheavals that would inevitably follow an election victory, Bauer kept the left wing of the party in line for a long time, but after 5 March 1933 – the day the German Nazi Party won the largest share of seats in Germany&#x27;s Reichstag election – the left wing accused him of inappropriate hesitation in defending against the advance of fascism.

=== Integral socialism ===
On the international level, Bauer tried to maintain the idea that the victory of socialism conformed to the laws of historical materialism. His idea of integral socialism, with the medium term goal of reuniting Bolsheviks and reformist social democrats, nevertheless proved in practice not to be realizable.

The International Working Union of Socialist Parties that was initiated for the purpose of such a reunification was tasked with mediating between the Second (Socialist) and Third (Communist) Internationals. The members of the Third International were to be encouraged to take steps towards internal democratization and those of the Second International to turn away from reformism. The project, which was derided by Karl Radek, a Polish functionary of the Third International, as an &quot;excretory product of the world revolution ()&quot;, failed.

== Evaluation ==

=== Opponents ===
As a leading theoretician of Austromarxism, Otto Bauer shaped his party&#x27;s 1926 Linz Program. It, and especially the conditionally formulated passage on the dictatorship of the proletariat, led conservatives and German nationalists to warn against &quot;Austrobolshevism&quot;. Opponents also accused Bauer of having fled the country in the course of the February 1934 uprising.

=== Colleagues ===
In 1953 Joseph Buttinger wrote:
The steel framework of his doctrinal edifice was the recognition of the objective relations that determine the &#x27;real course of history&#x27;. [...] Reality, which Marx taught men to recognize so that they might rise against it, Bauer placed on the highest throne. What was real had prevailed against material obstacles and human intentions, was accordingly an inevitable result of social development, necessary, and therefore as an evil at the same time good, for it was also the precondition of all better things to come. This was true not only of capitalism, it was equally true of reformism and the Russian Revolution. Consequently, it was the duty of revolutionaries to recognize the &#x27;power of circumstances&#x27; from which reformism sprang.
This can, however, as Buttinger noted, lead to the conviction &quot;that the opposite of revolutionary politics, if it corresponds to &#x27;circumstances&#x27;, is as good for the victory of socialism as the latter itself.&quot;

The SDAP politician Wilhelm Ellenbogen painted the picture of a dazzling theoretician, a forceful, eloquent idealist who lacked only one thing:
that absolute, instinctive accuracy in political judgment, the &#x27;nose&#x27; which distinguishes the genuine political genius from the dilettante, and lets him, as it were, blindly hit the right target, and for which there is no rule, no theory and no textbook.
The &quot;Declaration of the Left&quot; at the Social Democratic Party Congress in October 1933 held Bauer&#x27;s policy to account in almost angry terms:
The policy of the party leadership since March of this year has been a policy of waiting, a tactic of letting the enemy dictate all deadlines, all terms of conflict. This tactic is wrong. In recent months, the government has made its tactics clear even to the politically blind. It is not a fascism that storms but a fascism that creeps which we have to repel ... The tactic is wrong that says: not today, not tomorrow, but if the government does this and that, then we will proclaim a general strike.

=== Later influences ===
The basic features of Bauer&#x27;s Austromarxism can be found in the Revolutionary Socialists, who Bauer supported and were active underground from 1934 to 1938, and after 1938 in the Foreign Mission of the Austrian Socialists (AVOES).

In 1945 the newly founded &quot;Social Democratic Party of Austria (Social Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists)&quot; (SPÖ) oriented itself around Bauer&#x27;s ideological opposite, Karl Renner, who served as the first Chancellor of the Republic of Austria. Bauer&#x27;s Marxism initially retained a certain formal status, as can be seen from the addition of the parenthetic &#x27;Social Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists&#x27; to the official party name, but its influence quickly waned, since most Social Democrats wanted nothing to do with the vocabulary used by Communists. The conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) had long warned against what it saw as the threatening red united front.

The social philosopher Norbert Leser held that Bauer&#x27;s death in 1938 prevented a difficult dispute over the post-war direction of the SPÖ:
Had Otto Bauer – the brain and soul of Austromarxism – still been alive in 1945 and returned to Austria, it would hardly have been possible to avoid a dispute about the mistakes of the old leadership, but with him serving as a dead icon who was invoked on holidays but denied in everyday life, the postwar SPÖ got along fine.
Bruno Kreisky honored Otto Bauer with a nine-volume edition of his works published beginning in 1975, but it no longer had any impact on party policy. In 1986 Kreisky considered Bauer among the great men he had met &quot;despite some misjudgments of a superior intellect&quot;.

What had given Bauer&#x27;s Austromarxism its international uniqueness was the attempt to steer a Marxist middle course between the Bolsheviks and the reformist Social Democrats with the ultimate goal of democratizing the Soviet Union and reuniting them all in a common International. In the Cold War period, until the beginning of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reform, the hope proved illusory and it remained unreal even later.

=== Tributes ===
In 1914 Otto Bauer rented an apartment in a middle-class building at the corner of Gumpendorfer Strasse 70 and Kasernengasse 2 in Vienna&#x27;s 6th district of Mariahilf and lived there until he fled Austria in 1934. Kasernengasse was renamed Otto-Bauer-Gasse in 1949 in his honor.
=== Family ===
Otto Bauer&#x27;s son Martin, born in 1919, was a successful animator and film producer in Austria who was responsible for numerous remarkable television commercials in the 1950s and 1960s. For the 1966 National Council election he produced a cartoon commercial for the SPÖ at his own expense.

Otto&#x27;s sister Ida Bauer (1882–1945) became known as a patient of Sigmund Freud, who wrote a famous case history about her in which he referred to her by the pseudonym &quot;Dora&quot;. Katharina Adler, born in 1980, told the story of her great-grandmother in her novel &quot;Ida&quot;, published in the summer of 2018.

A nephew of Otto Bauer was the orchestral conductor Kurt Herbert Adler.

<doc id="861629" wikidata="Q5968746" url="?curid=861629" title="IBM 9020">
<text>The IBM 9020 was an IBM System/360 computer adapted into a multiprocessor system for use by the U.S. FAA for Air Traffic Control. Systems were installed in the FAA&#x27;s 20 &quot;en route&quot; Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), beginning in the late 1960s. The U.K. CAA also installed a system in its London centre. The IBM 9020A, for example, was based on the S/360-50 and the 9020D used two out of three or four S/360-65 processors for flight and radar data processing with two out of three S/360-50 processors providing input/output capability.

There were three operational variants of the 9020 system: 9020A CCC (Central Computer Complex); 9020D CCC; and 9020E DCC (Display Channel Complex). All the 9020A CCCs were attached to a non-IBM display complex, while the 9020D CCCs could be attached to either a non-IBM display complex or to the IBM 9020E DCC. The 9020A and 9020D CCCs carried out flight and radar data processing but needed an attached display complex to provide a plan view display (PVD) to the air traffic controllers. The non-IBM display complex was the Raytheon 730 Computer Display Channel (CDC) in the U.S. and the Plessey Processed Radar Display System (PRDS) in the U.K. The Raytheon CDC could drive a maximum of 60 PVDs. The five ARTCCs that exceeded this requirement were equipped with the IBM DCC which could drive up to 90 PVDs.

The air traffic control software ran on a modified version of OS/360 MVT as an embedded operating system, OS/9020, also referred to as the “Monitor”.  The monitor provided communications, storage management, timing, scheduling and recording services. That software was written in JOVIAL. JOVIAL is particularly well suited to managing tables and linked lists which are used extensively in the system.  The support tools, assemblers and compilers also ran on OS/9020.

Initially three 9020 CCC variants were proposed, with different flight plan (FP) capacities: 9020A max 325 FPs; 9020B max 200 FPs; and 9020C max 100 FPs. In the event, only the 9020A was delivered, plus the later 9020D with a 650 FP capacity.

Each FAA ARTCC had a System Maintenance Monitor Console (SMMC - not itself part of the 9020) that brought together the status indications of the installed 9020 system(s) as well as related components, such as environmental systems and communications links.

A maximum configuration CCC/DCC complex contained 12 IBM S/360 mainframes. Not all FAA ARTCCs, of which there were 20, had the maximum configuration. The U.K. centre had a 9020D &quot;Triplex&quot; system with six IBM S/360s (three S/360-65s and three S/360-50s).

In addition to the 21 ARTCCs there were four sites with variously configured non-operational systems: 9020A, 9020D and 9020E support and development systems at the FAA&#x27;s NAFEC; 9020A and 9020E training systems at the FAA Academy; a simplex 9020D support system co-located with the CAA&#x27;s operational triplex 9020D London system, and a 9020A at Raytheon for testing their display system.

Jacksonville ARTCC initially had a 9020A, which was replaced by a 9020D. The relocated 9020A remained at Jacksonville to become the hardware platform for the Central Flow Control Function within the FAA&#x27;s Washington-based ATCSCC. It was renamed the Central Flow Control Computer and had a digital data link to the Washington command center. It was replaced by an IBM 4341 system in 1984.

On June 9, 1977, a treaty “IRAN - Aviation: Technical Assistance” was signed between the FAA and the Civil Aviation Organization of Iran. Under the terms of the treaty the FAA would provide technical assistance to improve the Iranian National Airspace System. This assistance included the installation of a 9020D and 9020E and associated equipment at a cost of $29m (out of a total contract cost of $272m). The treaty fell foul of the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution and the systems were never delivered.

==Longevity and follow-on systems==
The 9020As and 9020Ds were in service in North America until 1989 when they were finally replaced by IBM 3083 BX1 mainframes as part of the FAA&#x27;s HOST Computer System (HCS) upgrade. The 3083s in turn were replaced with IBM 9672 RA4 parallel processing servers during the FAA&#x27;s Host and Oceanic Computer System Replacement (HOCSR) completed in 1999. One reason for the 1999 upgrade was concern, probably unfounded, that the IBM 3083&#x27;s microcode would not operate properly in the year 2000. At least during the first phase of the upgrade, the 9672s were running the FAA&#x27;s original assembly language code in System/360 emulation mode. Because of the failure of the FAA&#x27;s Advanced Automation System (AAS) project, the 9020E Display Channel Complexes lasted well into the 1990s.

The CAA/NATS in the UK had a 9020D system in service running NAS from 1974 to 1990, at which time NAS was rehosted on to an IBM 4381 system. This system was known as the Host Computer System (HCS), and it retained the System/360 technology Peripheral Adapter Modules (PAMs) from the 9020D. The three PAMs (IBM 7289s) were switched off for the last time 27 November 1997 when their replacement (SPRINT) came into service.

=== Details of the UK 9020 system ===
The IBM 9020D system was operational at the London Air Traffic Control Centre, RAF West Drayton&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; from 1974 to 1990 supporting the UK Air Traffic Controllers. 

There were several variants of the 9020, but the UK had a 9020D Triplex consisting of three S/360 Model 65 and three S/360 Model 50 processors with shared discs, tapes, printer and Card Reader Punch.

Three of the processors were Compute Elements (CE)  and three were Input Output Compute Elements (IOCE). An operational system was 2 CEs and 2 IOCEs.   All processors ran the National Airspace System (NAS) Software.   The IOCEs handled all the input output channel programmes and processed radar data.

The CEs ran the Flight Data processing software in a real-time, multiprocessor environment.

The third CE and IOCE provided backup in case of a hardware error and they would be automatically switched into the configuration upon failure of the online system.

A simplex system of one CE and one IOCE (and peripherals) provided a test and development environment

The NAS Software ran in 2.5Mb of memory with a couple of spare storage elements which were switched in automatically in the event of a storage check.

The Air Traffic Control Software, Known as NAS in the UK had five primary operational functions: 

(in the US, NAS refers to the Whole Air Traffic System - National Airspace System)

1)    ROUTE PROCESSING - Convert a flight plan into a series of fixes. For each fix, determine what time the flight will arrive, at which height it will be and determine which air traffic control team (Sector) are responsible for that geographical space.

2)    STRIP POSTING – At a parameter time before the flight is due in the sector, print a flight strip with the aircraft information to allow the air traffic controllers to identify flights that are planned to be in the same place, at the same height at the same time so they can be safely separated.

3)    RADAR PROCESSINIG - Convert range and bearing radar data from 10 different radars into an [x,y] coordinate on the system plane. Stereographic projection converts the data to a flat-earth model with the point of tangency (where the flat plane meets the round earth) near to Oxford. For each 16 mile square there was a preferred, secondary and tertiary radar source.  If available, the preferred source would always be used for the conversion with the secondary and tertiary sources being used if the preferred radar was not available.   This gave the controllers the best possible radar coverage in a mosaic.    The [x,y] data was sent on to a Plessey radar display system.

4)    CORRELATION – by matching the radar beacon codes transmitted by an aircraft and by looking for the right flight in the right place at about the right time, the radar and flight plan data could be correlated and the flight tracked.   This allowed the flight strip data presented to the air traffic controllers to be updated with actual times.   If the flight was ahead or behind of schedule a time-update could be sent to the controllers.

5)    CO-ORDINATION – Interfaces to adjacent countries allowed flights to be electronically passed between the country’s airspace.  The simple protocol said “This flight, will be at this location, at this height, at this time.”  If there was no rejection within 60 seconds, the flight was deemed to be handed over.

The NAS software records the flight plan database to disk every 30 seconds.   In the event of a failure, the system will perform a STARTOVER. This involves dumping the contents of memory to disk and tape for offline analysis of the failure, reloading all of the software from disk and reconstituting the flight plan database from the latest recovery recording.  A startover takes between 2 and 10 seconds.

Later in its life NAS Terminator processing was added to detect if the same flight causes two startovers in a parameter time. In this case, the flight plan is quarantined as “Potentially bad” and it is removed from the database.

The NAS Software suite included a wide range of build, debug, analysis, test and patching software.

To save system resources at run time, the geographic database of the UK airspace and the addresses of all of the peripherals are pre-processed, sorted and linked into a pre-populated database by an offline build tool which is attached to the Applications and Monitor at system build time.

In the late 1980s, the UK 9020D gained an unhelpful reputation for becoming unreliable after two failures in a single year.  The failures were actually in the 60Hz UPS systems that provided power but the 9020 was condemned.   Only at decommissioning did it become apparent that the system could have run on 50Hz with a slightly slower cooling fan speed.

In 1990, the NAS software was rehosted onto System 370, 4381 processors with 3380 DASD and 3480 tapes.   The software configuration was changed to main and standby with a heartbeat between the two processors.   If the Standby processor fails to receive a heartbeat in a parameter time, it promotes itself to Main, switches all of the peripherals to itself and performs a startover to rebuild the flight plan database. The system is no longer multi-processing.

<doc id="861630" wikidata="Q5027271" url="?curid=861630" title="Camp Hyrule">
<text>Camp Hyrule was an annual online virtual camp that was sponsored and moderated by Nintendo of America. It first opened in the summer of 1995, and emerged as Nintendo&#x27;s biggest online event. Camp Hyrule, which was usually held in August, allowed Nintendo fans to chat, play online games, and win prizes under the supervision of Nintendo employees and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; columnists. The camp&#x27;s name is named after the fictional land of Hyrule, a prominent and recurring setting in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. The last camp was in 2007, with no plans to host another Camp Hyrule.

==Background==
Essentially an online simulation of a summer camp, Camp Hyrule had refined many traditional outdoor themes, such as campfires, water sports, and archery into many Java-based games. Participants were assigned to cabins, where they worked with other teammates to earn points by participating in games, Photoshop contests, and other activities. After the camp session ended, the cabin with the most points won a special prize, while runner-up cabins received other consolation prizes.

The camp was also used to promote various Nintendo-related products. In past years, some of the camp&#x27;s games have revolved around &quot;1080° Avalanche&quot;, the Game Boy Advance SP, and &quot;Donkey Konga&quot;. Additionally, the camp had a theme, related to an upcoming video game, that often prompted mini-story line. For example, in 2005, the camp&#x27;s design and layout reflected the upcoming &quot;Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;. Nintendo went to further detail to add a story line to that camp session, in which games and layouts were mysteriously vanishing at the hands of an evil force. Nevertheless, all the issues were always resolved at the camp&#x27;s closing ceremony, where awards and grand prize winners were announced.

Camp Hyrule was moderated and maintained by Nintendo of America&#x27;s online staff. Staff members, called counselors, were responsible for moderating their assigned cabin&#x27;s message board and chat rooms, while also advocating participants to earn points. The camp&#x27;s staff also sent participants daily emails pertaining to earning points or the camp&#x27;s plot developments. Nintendo later turned to the &quot;NSider Forums&quot;, their official online community, in order to provide additional moderators. Camp Hyrule also had a mascot, named Stumpy, who was often seen wandering the campgrounds.

The community elements were removed from Camp Hyrule in 2007, coinciding with the closing of the NSider forums and the impending switch from in-house publication of Nintendo Power to publication by Future US, which occurred in November 2007.

==Registration==
Nintendo generally opened registration for Camp Hyrule in late July or early August. Although there was no limit as to how many users could sign up, registration was only open for one week. Registration required a &quot;My Nintendo&quot; account, which Nintendo has since phased out to bring Club Nintendo to the US.

The 2007 camp was open from August 13 to August 23 to all My Nintendo members, and registration was not required.

==Landmarks==
Camp Hyrule features several landmarks which have appeared year after year on the campgrounds:
* NOA HQ, a chatroom exclusive to Nintendo of America employees. It also serves as the camp&#x27;s command center.
* Trading Post, an area where updates regarding announcements, contests, and other miscellaneous information are disseminated to users by camp counselors.
* First Aid Hut, an area which offers users technical support.
* The Amphitheater, a chatroom which hosts special events, such as interviews from Nintendo officials, and the camp&#x27;s annual closing ceremony.
* Lake Webaconda, an area which features games related to water sport activities, such as fishing and boating.
* The Bonfire, usually the camp&#x27;s largest &quot;general discussion&quot; chat room.
* Stumpy&#x27;s Stable, where users can play a game in which they feed Stumpy, the camp&#x27;s mascot.
* The Lost Woods, a chatroom for discussion of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, often secretly used by the majority of the veterans from the &quot;Trivia HQ&quot;, one of the Live Chats on the NSider forums during Camp Hyrule as a substitute place to chat. The Annual Lost Woods Trivia was also hosted here by TSA.
* Maniac&#x27;s Cave, a secret chatroom inside Camp Hyrule. The Camp Maniac would occasionally come out and boot everyone out of the chatroom.
* Kirby&#x27;s Mess Hall, a chat formerly called &quot;Mess Hall&quot; until Kirby took over. Users were virtually fed &quot;food&quot; and it was a general discussion chat.
* Mr. Pickle&#x27;s Crib, a chat only open to NOA Shaun when he decides to use it.

==History==
*Camp Hyrule was first held from August 15 to August 19, 1995, on AOL.
*In 1997, Camp Hyrule was moved from AOL to www.nintendo.com
*In 1999, Camp Hyrule moved to the more familiar &quot;www.camphyrule.com&quot;.
*Beginning with the 2000 camp, campgrounds were designed around a theme based on an upcoming console or game release. The first theme used was &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;.
*In 2000, Camp Hyrule began the tradition of ending each year&#x27;s camp with a disaster.
*In 2002, registration quotas were finally removed due to popular request. Prior to 2002, Camp Hyrule was limited to the 500-2000 registrants, thus causing intense competition and often overloading the servers.
*In 2002, a majority of the camp&#x27;s themes were renamed to make the camp more Nintendo related.
*In 2005, each member of the winning cabin received a free Stumpy T-shirt.
*In 2006, due to glitches the closing ceremonies were delayed for two hours.
*In 2006, all campers were entered into a sweepstakes to win a Wii.
*In 2007, the site&#x27;s administrators announced they will remove Camp Hyrule&#x27;s community elements. Also, all participants in the United States were able to enter a sweepstakes to win a life-size Link statue.
*The 2008 event was nonexistent.
*In 2009, the Camp Hyrule page originally directed to the Nintendo.com home page, though it eventually relaunched in the archived 2007 format.

<text>Paul Pritchard (born 1967) is a rock climber and mountaineer and was one of the foremost British climbers of the 1980s and 1990s. He was born in Bolton, England and started climbing when he was 16 years old. He is notable for having climbed difficult routes across the United Kingdom and around the world. In 1998, he sustained a traumatic brain injury while attempting to climb the Totem Pole, which left him hemiplegic. Since the accident he has continued to engage in various forms of outdoor recreation, has published multiple books about his recovery, and is now a disability educator specialising in diversity and inclusion.

== Early life ==
Pritchard was born in Bolton, and started climbing at the age of 16 in his native Lancashire. Within a year he had started to repeat some of the hardest routes in the county, as well as beginning his own additions. He made many ascents of outstanding problems in the Lancashire Quarries as well as engaging in extensive exploration of Malham Cove.

In 1986 he moved to Llanberis in North Wales, climbing extensively on the slate of the Llanberis quarries and on the sea cliffs at Gogarth, situated between North Stack and South Stack, near Holyhead. He gained a reputation for climbing hard and very poorly protected routes such as Super Calabrese (E8 6b) at Gogarth, still considered one of the most serious routes in the UK.

== Shift to The Mountains ==
In 1990, he began mountaineering, and subsequently climbed many difficult big wall routes around the world. This included a major new climb up the East Face of Central Tower Of Paine in Patagonia, the first ascent of the West Face of Mount Asgard on Baffin Island, Trango Tower and multiple attempts on the then-unclimbed Shark&#x27;s Fin on Meru Peak, in the Indian Himalayan Region.

== Injury and recovery ==
On Friday 13 February 1998, Pritchard&#x27;s life changed drastically when he was struck in the head by a falling boulder while attempting an ascent of the Totem Pole, a slender sea stack off the coast of Tasmania. He was rendered semiconscious, bleeding, and nearly helpless. Over the next hours a heroic rescue was effected by his partner, Celia Bull. He was left suffering from hemiplegia, a condition that robbed him of feeling and movement in his right side and which caused his speech and memory to suffer.

== Disability Ambassador ==
Pritchard has continued to lead a challenging life even after the catastrophic injury. He has climbed Kilimanjaro, ridden a recumbent trike through Tibet to Mount Everest and took the lead rock climbing again. In 2016 Paul finally climbed the Totem Pole, 18 years after his accident. The film of this, Doing It Scared, won numerous awards.

In 2017 Pritchard, and 4 other people with disabilities, accomplished the first journey under human power between Australia’s extremities of altitude. On the Lowest To Highest Expedition the team members cycled from Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre (-15m) to Kosciuszko -Targangil (2228m), a distance of 2152 km.
In 2022 he led a team of people with various disabilities across the challenging Larapinta Trail for 17 days, a distance of 237 km.

Pritchard is now a diversity and inclusion educator and speaks internationally on the subject as well as volunteering with the Human Library.

== Publications ==
Pritchard has written four books:

* &quot;Deep Play&quot; (1997) is about his early climbing experiences
* &quot;Totem Pole&quot; (1999) about his accident and his recovery from it
* &quot;The Longest Climb&quot; (2005) continues his story of recovery
* &quot;The Mountain Path&quot; (2021) delves into spiritual and philosophical aspects of climbing

He won the 1997 Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature for his book &quot;Deep Play&quot;. 
He also won the Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature for The&quot;Totem Pole&quot; which was also awarded the 1999 Banff Mountain Book Festival Grand Prize. The Longest Climb was shortlisted for the Banff Mountain Book Festival Mountain Literature Prize. The Mountain Path was the only book shortlisted for both a Banff prize and the B/T in 2022 and won the 2022 NZ Mountain Book Festival award for non-fiction.

<text>James R. Savage (September 9, 1910 – April 4, 1951) was a columnist who originated the &quot;Tower Ticker&quot; column in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1948 and wrote it until his death in 1951. He signed the column simply &quot;Savage&quot;.

Savage was born in Chicago to a family long established there. He attended Northwestern University. He worked in show business, both in theater management, notably for Balaban and Katz (B&amp;K), and as a writer. Despite being blind in one eye, he joined the Navy during World War II as a press relations officer, and rejoined B&amp;K afterwards. He joined the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1948.

He died in 1951 while covering the Academy Awards in Los Angeles.

<text>The Logos Foundation is a professional artistic organisation founded in 1968. It focuses on the promotion of new musics and audio related arts by means of new music production, concerts, performances, composition, technological research projects and other contemporary music related activities.

The Logos Foundation (and its concert hall, the Logos Tetrahedron) is based in Ghent, Belgium (Flanders region).

Composers Godfried-Willem Raes and Moniek Darge are the major driving forces behind the Logos Foundation.

Since the last decades of the 20th century the Logos Foundation encourages publication of music in a copyright-free format.

==Logos Tetrahedron==
The &quot;Logos Tetrahedron&quot; is a concert hall in Ghent, Belgium adjacent to the foundation&#x27;s recording studio and offices. It has seating for 150 people and is equipped with sound and light infrastructure. Since the concert hall is in the shape of a tetrahedron, it has no straight angles and, as a result, no standing waves can occur. Acoustic waves can never amplify one another in phase and are reflected by the walls under ever changing angles.

The hall is exclusively used for contemporary and experimental music, such as electronic music and computer music and holds approximately 65 concerts a year, primarily by the Logos Foundation. In 2012 they were host for the ISCM World Music Days

The concert hall was built in 1990 by Godfried-Willem Raes and the Logos workgroup using steel, concrete and plate-metal. Construction took one year. The hall was opened in 1991 with a three-day festival.

==M&amp;M robot orchestra==
Logos houses the innovative music ensemble M&amp;M robot orchestra (man and machine). All kinds of musical interfaces (wireless gesture control, real time sound analysis, microwave radar, acceleration sensors, pyrodetectors, lightsensors, myoelectric devices, brainwaves, EEG and ECG and so on) are combined with the results of experimental robot design. Collaborative concerts are organised involving interactive robots and musicians.
They made a &quot;manual&quot; for composers who would like to write for this orchestra.

In 2021, the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst in Ghent dedicated an exhibition to the Logos Foundation and its robot orchestra.

<doc id="861658" wikidata="Q1437547" url="?curid=861658" title="Illinois General Assembly">
<text>The Illinois General Assembly is the legislature of the U.S. state of Illinois. It has two chambers, the Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate. The General Assembly was created by the first state constitution adopted in 1818. , the current General Assembly is the 104th; the term of an assembly lasts two years. 

Under the Illinois Constitution, since 1983 the Senate has had 59 members and the House has had 118 members. In both chambers, all members are elected from single-member districts and districts are drawn to represent generally equal populations and redrawn every ten years based on census returns. Each Senate district is divided into two adjacent House districts. 

The General Assembly meets in the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield. Its session laws are generally adopted by majority vote in both houses, and upon gaining the assent of the Governor of Illinois. They are published in the official &quot;Laws of Illinois&quot;.

Two presidents of the United States, Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama, began their political careers in the Illinois General Assembly–– in the Illinois House of Representatives and Illinois Senate, respectively.

==History==
The Illinois General Assembly was created by the first state constitution adopted in 1818. Initially, the state did not have organized political parties, but the Democratic and Whig parties began to form in the 1830s.

Future U.S. President Abraham Lincoln successfully campaigned as a member of the Whig Party to serve in the General Assembly in 1834. He served four successive terms 1834–42 in the Illinois House of Representatives, supporting expanded suffrage and economic development. He later went to the presidency as part of then new Republican Party.

In 1877, John W. E. Thomas was the first African American elected to the legislature. In 1922, Lottie Holman O&#x27;Neill was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, becoming the first woman to serve in the Illinois General Assembly.

Future U.S. President Barack Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, serving there until 2004 when he was elected to the United States Senate.

===Size over time===
The size of the General Assembly has changed over time. The first General Assembly, elected in 1818, consisted of 14 senators and 28 representatives. Under the and , the legislature could add and reapportion districts at any time, and by 1870 it had done so ten times. Under the , Illinois was divided into 51 legislative districts, each of which elected one senator and three representatives. The representatives were elected by cumulative voting, in which each voter had three votes that could be distributed among one, two, or three candidates. Due to the unwillingness of downstate Illinois to cede power to the growing Chicago area, the district boundaries were not redrawn from 1901 to 1955.

After voters approved the Legislative Apportionment Amendment in 1954, there were 58 Senate districts and 59 House districts, which did not necessarily coincide. This new arrangement was conceived as a &quot;little federal&quot; system: the Senate districts would be based on land area and would favor downstate, while the House districts would be based on population. House members continued to be elected by cumulative voting, three from each House district. With the adoption of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, the system of separate House and Senate districts was eliminated, and legislative districts were apportioned on a one person, one vote basis. The state was divided into 59 legislative districts, each of which elected one senator and three representatives.

The cumulative voting system was abolished by the Cutback Amendment in 1980. Since then, the House has been elected from 118 single-member districts, which are formed by dividing each of the 59 Senate districts in half. Each senator is &quot;associated&quot; with two representatives.

==Terms of members==
Members of the House of Representatives are elected to a two-year term without term limits.

Members of the Illinois Senate serve two four-year terms and one two-year term each decade. This ensures that Senate elections reflect changes made when the General Assembly is redistricted following each United States Census. To prevent complete turnovers in membership (except after an intervening Census), not all Senators are elected simultaneously. The term cycles for the Senate are staggered, with the placement of the two-year term varying from one district to another. Each district&#x27;s terms are defined as 2-4-4, 4-2-4, or 4-4-2. Like House members, Senators are elected without term limits.

==Officers==
The officers of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even-numbered year. Representatives of the House elect from its membership a Speaker and Speaker pro tempore, drawn from the majority party in the chamber. The Illinois Secretary of State convenes and supervises the opening House session and leadership vote. State senators elect from the chamber a President of the Senate, convened and under the supervision of the governor. Since the adoption of the current Illinois Constitution in 1970, the Lieutenant Governor of Illinois does not serve in any legislative capacity as Senate President, and has had its office&#x27;s powers transferred to other capacities. The Illinois Auditor General is a legislative officer appointed by the General Assembly that reviews all state spending for legality.

==Sessions and qualifications==
The General Assembly&#x27;s first official working day is the second Wednesday of January each year. The Secretary of State presides over the House until it chooses a Speaker and the governor presides over the Senate until it chooses a President. Both chambers must also select a Minority Leader from among the members of the second most numerous party. 

In order to serve as a member in either chamber of the General Assembly, a person must be a U.S. citizen, at least 21 years of age, and for the two years preceding their election or appointment a resident of the district which they represent. In the general election following a redistricting, a candidate for any chamber of the General Assembly may be elected from any district which contains a part of the district in which they resided at the time of the redistricting and reelected if a resident of the new district they represents for 18 months prior to reelection.

===Restrictions===
Members of the General Assembly may not hold other public offices or receive appointments by the governor, and their salaries may not be increased during their tenure.

== Vacancies ==

Seats in the General Assembly may become vacant due to a member resigning, dying, being expelled, or being appointed to another office. Under the Illinois Constitution, when a vacancy occurs, it must be filled by appointment within 30 days. If a Senate seat becomes vacant more than 28 months before the next general election for that seat, an election is held at the next general election. The replacement member must be a member of the same party as the departing member. The General Assembly has enacted a statute governing this process. Under that statute, a replacement member is appointed by the party committee for that district, whose votes are weighted by the number of votes cast for that office in the area that each committee member represents.

The appointment process was unsuccessfully challenged before the Illinois Supreme Court in 1988 as an unconstitutional grant of state power to political parties, but the challenge failed.

==Vetoes==

The governor can veto bills passed by the General Assembly in four different ways: a full veto, an amendatory veto, and, for appropriations only, an item veto and a reduction veto. These veto powers are unusually broad among US state governors. The line item veto was added to the Illinois Constitution in 1884. The amendatory and reduction vetoes were new additions in the 1970 Constitution.

The General Assembly can override full, amendatory and item vetoes by a three-fifths majority vote in both chambers. It can override a reduction veto by a simple majority vote in both chambers. If both chambers agree to the changes the governor suggests in an amendatory veto, these changes can be approved by a simple majority vote in both chambers. If the General Assembly approves an amended law in response to the governor&#x27;s changes, the bill becomes law once the governor certifies that the suggested changes have been made.

== Joint Committee on Administrative Rules ==
By statute, the General Assembly has the power to block regulations, including emergency regulations, proposed by state administrative agencies. This power is currently exercised by the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR). JCAR is made up of 12 members, with equal numbers from the House and Senate and equal numbers from each political party. It can block proposed rules by a 3/5 vote. The General Assembly can then reverse the block by a joint resolution of both houses.

JCAR was first established in 1978 and given only advisory powers. The General assembly gave it the power to temporarily block or suspend administrative regulations for 180 days in 1980. In September 2004, the General Assembly expanded this temporary suspension power into a permanent veto. As the Illinois Constitution does not provide for a legislative veto, the constitutionality of this arrangement has been questioned. Among the charges brought against Governor Rod Blagojevich in his 2009 impeachment trial was that he had not respected the legitimacy of JCAR blocking his rulemaking on healthcare in 2008.

<text>Covilhã () is a city and a municipality in the Centro region, Portugal. The city proper had 33,691 inhabitants in 2021. The municipality population in 2021 was 46,455 in an area of . It is located in the Beiras e Serra da Estrela subregion and Beiras and Serra da Estrela Intermunicipal Community. The municipal holiday is October 20. Sometimes referred to as &quot;town of wool and snow&quot;, Covilhã is one of the main urban centres of the historical Beira Interior region. The proximity of the mountains offers dramatic scenery and a great environment for those fond of hiking, camping, mountain climbing and skiing. With an industrial tradition historically focused on textile industry supplied by an abundance of wool produced in the area since antiquity, but with a more diversified industry in contemporaneity, Covilhã, which was once known as the &quot;Portuguese Manchester&quot;, is also a university city nowadays awarding degrees from aeronautical engineering to medicine to philosophy.

==History==
Covilhã&#x27;s history dates back to the days when it was a pre-historical settlement, a shelter for Lusitanian shepherds, and a Roman fortress known as &quot;Cava Juliana&quot; or &quot;Silia Hermínia&quot;. The region of Beira Interior, where the city of Covilhã is located, is rich in historical places. Due to its strategic potential, its mountains were used to build castles for both attack and defence purposes. Covilhã was granted foral in 1186 by king Sancho I of Portugal, who also built the castle walls. And, later, it was king Denis of Portugal who ordered the construction of the walls of the admirable medieval district of Portas do Sol. The old quarters of the city have narrow cobblestone streets; pedestrians are challenged permanently by the ups and downs of most of the streets in the city.

It was already in the Middle Ages one of the main &quot;villages of the kingdom&quot;, a situation later confirmed by the fact that great natives from the city or its surroundings became decisive in all the great Portuguese Discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries: the advance in the Atlantic Ocean, the sea route to India, the discoveries of America and Brazil, the first circumnavigation of the Earth. In full population expansion when the Renaissance appeared, the economic sector was particularly important in agriculture, pastoralism, fruit-growing, and forestry. Trade and industry were booming. Gil Vicente cites &quot;the many fine cloths&quot;. The Infante D. Henrique, knowing this reality well, became &quot;lord&quot; of Covilhã. The Portuguese Discoveries required large sums of money. The people of the town and its council collaborated not only through taxes, but also with their capital and talent.

The expansion overseas started with the conquest of Ceuta in 1415. Covilhã personalities such as Frei Diogo Alves da Cunha, who is buried in the Church of Conceição, participated in the event. The presence of ‘’covilhanenses’’ in the whole process extends with Pêro da Covilhã (first Portuguese to set foot on land in Mozambique and who sent news to D. João II on how to reach the places where the spices were produced, preparing the Maritime Way to India), João Ramalho, Fernão Penteado and others.

Among the missionaries we find Francisco Álvares, killed on the way to Brazil; Pêro da Covilhã, chaplain in Vasco da Gama’s expedition to India, the first martyr of India; Father Francisco Cabral, missionary in Japan; Father Gaspar Pais, who left Goa for Abyssinia; and many others who took, along with their faith, the name of Covilhã and Fundão in Cova da Beira valley to all parts of the world. The brothers Rui Faleiro and Francisco Faleiro, cosmographers, became notable for their knowledge of nautical science. During renaissance is Friar Heitor Pinto, one of the first Portuguese to publicly defend the Portuguese identity. His literary work is expressed in the classic &quot;Image of Christian Life&quot;.

The importance of Covilhã, in this period, is explained not only by the &quot;notable&quot; title granted to it by king D. Sebastião but also by the works carried out here and in the region by the Castilian kings during the time of the Iberian Union. The Town Hall Square was indeed until the end of the 20th century, of Spanish Philippine style. In the surrounding streets one can find several traces of this style. In the municipality as well. Examples of Manueline style can also be found in the city. This is the case of a Manueline window in the Jewish quarter in Rua das Flores. The architect Mateus Fernandes, from Covilhã, who designed the entrance door to the Imperfect Chapels in the Monastery of Batalha is also other notable personality from Covilhã.

The two streams that come down from the Serra da Estrela, Carpinteira and Degoldra, cross the urban center and were at the origin of the industrial development. They provided the hydraulic energy that allowed the factories to work. Next to these two streams, today an interesting industrial archaeological site can be seen, composed of dozens of ruined buildings. A school-factory was built by Fernando de Meneses, 2nd Count of Ericeira in 1681. On November 1, 1755, Covilhã was shaken by the forces of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake that destroyed part of Covilhã&#x27;s castle walls and its large towers. 

A Royal Textile Factory was established in the city by the Marquis of Pombal in 1763, and Covilhã was granted city status on 20 October 1870 by king Luís I. Along the two streams that cross the city there are still remains of the old textile factories, which bear witness to the unquestionable importance of this industry for Covilhã&#x27;s economy, once known as the &quot;Portuguese Manchester&quot;. The Panasqueira mines in the municipality of Covilhã started production in 1898 and at the time of World War II, about 10,000 people worked in there.

During the first half of the 19th century, the municipality of Covilhã had about 22,000 inhabitants, and in 1930 it nearly reached 50,000 inhabitants. During the 1960s, Covilhã&#x27;s municipality surpassed 70,000 inhabitants, but the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974) and the generalized emigration phenomena of the 1960s to 1980s Portuguese society, its geographical location in the mountainous interior of central Portugal, increasing mechanization, and the stagnation of its textile industrial sector caused a period of decline of its population to nearly 50,000 in the 1990s. A state-run university, UBI - Universidade da Beira Interior, was founded in 1979. The city is still expanding, mainly to the flat part of the valley, called Cova da Beira, where some important infrastructure, such as the central hospital and the highway, are located.

==Geography==

Covilhã is located in the Centro region, Cova da Beira subregion, in central Portugal; 300 km (186 mi) Northeast of Lisbon, Portugal&#x27;s capital; 100 km (62 mi) East of Coimbra, the regional administrative centre; and at the bottom of the highest Portuguese mountain range, Serra da Estrela.

The city of Castelo Branco is located 50 km (31 mi) to the south of Covilhã and the neighboring city of Fundão, the largest locality in the vicinities of Covilhã, is 20 km (12.4 mi) also to the south.

The city of Covilhã towers between 450 and 800 metres (1,476 and 2,624 feet) above the sea level, thus the mountain landscape is ever present. The larger municipality has 555.6 km2 (214.5 sq mi) of territory and includes several localities distributed across 31 civil parishes.

In the municipality of Covilhã but outside the urban area, Penhas da Saúde is one of its highest points. At 1,500 metres (4,821 ft) high, this village and winter resort is located within the Serra da Estrela Natural Park.

==Climate==

Covilhã has a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), moderately cold in the winter, and relatively warm in the summer. The Serra da Estrela Ski Resort, the only one in Portugal, lies about 20 km (12.4 mi) away from the city, already in the neighbouring municipality of Seia.

The cold increases according to altitude, varying from higher temperatures in the lower parts of the municipality, to colder temperatures with frequent and sometimes abundant snowfalls during the cold months in the higher areas, such as Penhas da Saúde, above 1,500 meters of altitude, 9 km away from the highest point of mainland Portugal, the Torre Plateau. In the urban area of Covilhã snowfalls with accumulation are rare.

The hottest month is August, with an average temperature of , while the coldest month is January, with an average of . The average annual temperature of Covilhã is and the average annual rainfall is around .

It has also a number of 2nd and 3rd cycle basic and secondary schools: &quot;Escola Secundária Frei Heitor Pinto&quot;, &quot;Escola Básica dos 2º e 3º ciclos de Tortosendo&quot;, &quot;Escola Básica Integrada de Sao Domingos&quot;, &quot;Escola Básica dos 2º e 3º ciclos de Paúl&quot;, &quot;Escola Básica do 2º ciclo de Pêro da Covilhã&quot;, &quot;Escola Secundária Campos Melo&quot;, &quot;Escola Secundária Quinta das Palmeiras&quot;, &quot;Escola Básica dos 2º e 3º ciclos de Teixoso&quot;, &quot;Externato de Nossa Senhora dos Remédios&quot; and &quot;Escola Internacional da Covilhã&quot;. Covilhã has a public university - the University of Beira Interior (UBI), which was founded in 1979 and awards all university academic degrees (licentiate &quot;licenciatura&quot;, master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees) in several fields like medicine, mathematics, sports sciences, aeronautical engineering, industrial design, fashion design, cinema, psychology, and many others.

==Economy==

Major economic activities in the region include textiles, food production, agriculture, tourism and mining. The Panasqueira mines in the municipality of Covilhã, located over 30 kilometers to southwest of the city, is a large tin-tungsten mine made up of multiple concessions that started production in 1898. The industrial mining center commonly known as Panasqueira Mines extends over a vast area covered by the Panasqueira and Vale da Ermida Mining Fields with a total area around 20.5 km2. There is an estimated 12,000 km of tunnels, some still working and others already abandoned. At the time of World War II, about 10,000 people worked in the mine; by 2017, approximately 370. The mine had a planned production for more than 30 years as of 2017. The University of Beira Interior, established in 1979, has great importance in the city today. The Centro Hospitalar Universitário Cova da Beira at Covilhã, a state-run university hospital, plays a major role in the region. Covilhã is traditionally a center of wool and textile industries - the university&#x27;s central building was the Royal Textile Factory, established by the Marquis of Pombal in the 18th century. Covilhã has deep industrial roots and is still one of the biggest woolen fabric producers in Europe. 

The textile industry produces about 40,000 km of fabric per year, mainly through companies like Paulo de Oliveira, Penteadora, Tessimax and A. Saraiva, which supply large worldwide textile and fashion brands such as Hugo Boss, Armani, Zegna, Marks &amp; Spencer, Yves St. Laurent, Calvin Klein and Christian Dior.

Tourism is also important, and the city serves as a winter and mountain resort. Fruit production is important in the region of Cova da Beira, a subregion centered in Covilhã&#x27;s municipality. Frulact, a Portuguese fruit processing company, has major industrial facilities in the municipality of Covilhã. 

The city has a science park, Parkurbis, which has attracted several new businesses to the area. There is a large shopping centre in Covilhã, &quot;Serra Shopping&quot;, and besides a wide variety of shops, it has hypermarket, four cinemas and many restaurants. Hypermarkets and supermarkets located in the lower part of the town include Continente (inside &quot;Serra Shopping&quot;), Intermarché, Pingo Doce, and Lidl. The Public Market (&quot;Mercado Municipal&quot;) is another option and an opportunity to buy fresh produce directly from the producers. Covilhã hosts one of the biggest data centres in Europe, with the capacity to store 30 petabytes of information at onset. The building, which belongs to Altice, opened in September 2013 and has a floor area the size of 13 football pitches.

==Culture==

The City Hall of Covilhã is responsible for the cultural programming of one of the movie theatres of the town which has a wide variety of activities throughout the year. This theatre, called Teatro Municipal da Covilhã, was closed from 2001 until 2021 when it was reopened in November. There are also various theatre companies: Teatrubi, ASTA, Teatro das Beiras and Quarta Parede that stage theatre and multimedia productions throughout the year. A theatre festival is organised by a local theatre company, Teatro das Beiras, in November.

The city hosts several choirs and orchestras, like the well-known university choir and the EPABI orchestra, which is based in the building near the public garden (location has now changed to the lower parts of the city), as well as the &quot;Orquestra da Banda Filarmónica&quot;. At the university, there are student musical groups that reflect the academic environment and celebrate its traditions. They are called &quot;Tunas&quot; and each one has particular characteristics. &quot;Desertuna&quot;, &quot;Moçoilas Tuna&quot; and &quot;J’ B’ubi &amp; To Kokuskopus&quot; perform throughout the year and welcome everyone that wants to join in and get into the academic spirit. The city hall organizes some musical events, mainly in Teatro Cine, which is located in the heart of the city centre (&quot;Pelourinho&quot;).

The theatre company GICC (&quot;Companhia de Teatro das Beiras&quot;), based in Travessa da Tapa, offers professional, high-quality performances. There are also various amateur drama groups and dance groups performing in several town locations; ASTA and TEATRUBI are just some examples. Conferences, exhibitions, trade fairs, concerts and other kinds of activities are common in the city. Several trade fairs occur throughout the year in a pavilion belonging to the ANIL – National Association of Textile Manufacturers ANIL.

Like other university towns Covilhã has a lively nightlife scene. Due to the small dimension of the city, it is easy and safe to get around, and there are many pleasant places to have a drink.

a freshman reception week, organised by the students&#x27; union of the University of Beira Interior (&quot;Associação Académica da Universidade da Beira Interior&quot;), takes place usually in November and includes a parade through town called &quot;Latada&quot; and several concerts.

== Cuisine ==
The cuisine of Covilhã is influenced by those of Serra da Estrela and the Cova da Beira..

Lamb, goat meat and river trout dishes, rice with carqueja (&quot;Genista tridentata)&quot;, a variety of cold meats (including chouriço and presunto), morcela, honey from Serra da Estrela Natural Park, local requeijão, the internationally acclaimed Serra da Estrela Cheese, peach, apple, chestnut, cherries and berries, are typical locally sourced ingredients and products used in Covilhã’s traditional cuisine.

The &quot;pastel de molho&quot;, a typical pastry of Covilhã made with a meat-based core and a saffron-based sauce, is regarded as the city’s gastronomic delicacy.

Cherovia (&quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;), informally described as a type of white carrot, is also a typical food in and around Covilhã.

==Sport==
The city has indoor swimming pools and there are also rivers and lakes where swimming is allowed. Facilities for horse riding and karting are also available. The mountain range has excellent conditions for mountain bike, trekking, climbing, skiing and snowboarding. There are tracks with artificial snow that are open all year. There are several gyms offering various services such as sauna, fitness, martial arts, and yoga.

Sporting Clube da Covilhã, a sports club founded in 1923 in Covilhã, is the most important sporting organization in the city. Its football (soccer) team now plays in the secondary national divisions, but in the past played in the top division. It is one of the few clubs of Portugal&#x27;s interior to have played in the top division of Portuguese football. This football team plays in the &quot;Estádio Municipal José dos Santos Pinto&quot;, a stadium opened in 1935 which is owned by the City Hall and is located in the higher part of the city at 1,200 meters above sea level. The City Hall is also the owner of a newer sports complex with a stadium and athletics track located in the lower part of the city and inaugurated in 2003 - it is the &quot;Complexo Desportivo da Covilhã&quot;.

==Transport==
The nearest airports are located in Lisbon and Porto. From these two cities, Covilhã can be very easily reached both by train and bus. The railway and bus stations of Covilhã are within a walking distance from one to the other (10 minutes walk). It is also possible to reach Covilhã directly by bus from abroad.

Covilhã is located, less than 300 km from Lisbon and Porto, the two biggest cities in Portugal and just 400 km from the Spanish capital, Madrid. Several national and international bus routes pass Covilhã, so it is easy and practical to reach almost all destinations. To reach Lisbon takes 3.5-4h by bus or by train. The bus station is situated in the lower part of the city; and the railway station is near, no more than 10 minutes walking. The railway company, CP (Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses), offers various types of services. An InterCity (&quot;Intercidades&quot;) train is recommended to reach Covilhã. There are also car rental companies in the city.

From Covilhã northwards to Guarda trains were operated by diesel motorcars. This scenic stretch of mountainous rural line provides the strategic last leg of the Beira Baixa Railway linking it to Guarda via Belmonte. However, for twelve years it was closed for modernisation and electrification. The works, originally due for completion in 2011, were finally completed permitting reopening of the 46 km line to Guarda in May 2021 after serious funding issues due to the weakness of the Portuguese economy.

A bus network – &quot;Transportes Urbanos da Covilhã&quot; – covers the entire urban area as well as the outskirts of the city, making it easy to travel both within and outside the city limits, although the buses are infrequent (not less than 1 hour between buses). Several bus lines serve university buildings. Cabs are also an option. They are painted cream (mostly black these days) and sometimes have a roof-light to identify them. In town they use taximeters, but once outside urban boundaries the service is charged per km.

<text>Grand View University is a private liberal arts university in Des Moines, Iowa. Founded in 1896 and affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the university enrolls approximately 2,000 students and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

==History==
Grand View College and Seminary was started in 1896 by members of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In 1912, Grand View opened a high school academy department. Instruction at the junior college level began in 1924 and accreditation by the Iowa State Department of Public Instruction came in 1938 following the dissolution of the academy. It gained accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1959. In 1968, the school&#x27;s theological seminary was relocated to Maywood, Illinois.

In 1975, nursing programs were added along with baccalaureate programs, and the school, which had been called Grand View Junior College, dropped the &quot;junior&quot; from its name to become Grand View College. In 2008, after adding graduate programs, the college renamed itself Grand View University.

The Grand View Danish Immigrant Archives houses a wide variety of information sources related to the Danish immigrant influence on the United States, including personal histories, photographs, writings, and a large collection of Danish American newspapers and magazines.

==Campus==
Grand View&#x27;s 50-acre campus is located in the Union Park Neighborhood of Des Moines, Iowa, just northeast of downtown. Over 800 students live on campus in six different residential facilities. Notable landmarks include the Humphrey Center—built in 1895 in the style of Danish Renaissance architecture—and a 159-foot long skywalk across U.S. Route 69 in the heart of campus.

===Major buildings===
Humphrey Center – Formerly Old Main, the Humphrey Center is the oldest building on campus, built in 1896. The offices of Admissions, Business, Financial Aid, Registrar, President, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Finance and Administration, and Vice President for Advancement are all located here. Humphrey is on the National Register of Historic Places, and was built in three different phases (1895, 1898, 1904). The facility underwent a complete renovation in 1998 and was named in recognition of alumnus Alice (Olson) Humphrey. The college&#x27;s maintenance division is based out of a garage directly north of the building.

Charles S. Johnson Wellness Center – Located at 1500 Morton Avenue, the 92,000-square-foot facility houses the nursing and kinesiology departments, recreational and athletic facilities, a community clinic, classrooms and faculty offices. The field house contains weight lifting equipment, a 1/10 mile track, and a double basketball court. Sisam Arena was renovated in 2002, while the wellness center was being constructed, and put in new bleachers, backboards, wall padding and a small media platform. The lobby of the arena showcases trophy cases featuring the Grand View Athletic Hall of Fame. Sisam Arena was named after David Sisam, longtime coach and athletic director. In 2008, a new two-level addition was added on the southeast corner bringing a new weight room, wrestling room and athletics staff offices.

Cowles Center – Located at 1331 Grandview Avenue, Cowles houses the Music Department with rehearsal spaces for band and choir teaching studios, mixed use practice room, and study space for students.

Krumm Business Center – Located at 1330 Morton Avenue, and named after college benefactor and former Maytag CEO Daniel J. Krumm, this academic building houses general-purpose classrooms, a large lecture hall, computer lab, and faculty/staff offices. The university&#x27;s information technology department is based out of the Krumm Center.

Library – Located at the corner of Morton Avenue and East 14th Street (U.S. Route 69), the two-story library was completed in 1968 with an addition added in 1992. The first floor contains a teaching classroom/computer lab, the reference collection, current periodicals and journals, the children&#x27;s and young adult collection, private study rooms, study tables, DVD and video viewing rooms, the information desk, and the bank of research computers. The library&#x27;s collection of books and journals as well as study tables are located on the second floor, along with the Danish Immigrant Archives. The library is also home to an Einstein Bros Bagels.

Rasmussen Center for Community Advancement Professions – located at 2800 East 14th Street U.S. Route 69), north of the library., the Rasmussen Center opened in fall 2008 and houses the departments of art, education, history, criminal justice, political studies, psychology and sociology, as well as general-purpose classrooms, art studios, computer labs, the ALT Center, faculty offices, and various student amenities. The building is named after Jim and Sandra Rasmussen, long-time supporters of Grand View who contributed $3 million to the building campaign.

The Kent L. Henning Student Center – Located at 2811 East 14th Street (U.S. Route 69), the Student Center was renovated and expanded in 2015 to accommodate the communication and theater departments, student dining, academic and career success centers, the bookstore, the Viking Theatre, student services and recreation, plus the Robert Speed Lyceum, a large multipurpose performance area.

==Academics==
Grand View offers 40+ undergraduate majors and four master&#x27;s degree programs. Its nine pre-professional programs include medicine, law, pharmacy, and physical therapy.

==Athletics==
The Grand View athletic teams are called the Vikings. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC) since the 2015–16 academic year. The Vikings previously competed in the defunct Midwest Collegiate Conference (MCC) from 1989–90 to 2014–15 (when the conference dissolved).

Grand View competes in 25 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, competitive dance, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball and wrestling; and co-ed sports include cheerleading, eSports (which was established in the fall of 2017) and shooting sports. The squads are supported by the athletic department.

Grand View University began competing in esports the fall of 2017 becoming the first higher education institute in Iowa to introduce a varsity program as well as offer esports scholarships. Grand View is a member of the National Association of Collegiate Esports. Grand View&#x27;s esports gaming arena is located in the basement of Nielsen Hall dormitory.

Hired in 2018 as Grand View&#x27;s director of esports, Dana Hustedt became the first female collegiate esports director in the United States.

==Student life==
Approximately 84% of Grand View students are from Iowa while 14% are from other elsewhere in the United States. International students make up 2% of the student population. Grand View University has more than 40 campus clubs and organizations that represent a variety of interests.

===Student government===
Viking Council is the governing body of Grand View students. It is composed of officers elected by the student body and a representative group of student senators. Viking Council is responsible for expenditure of student activity fees. Student Activities Council (SAC) is funded by and reports to the Viking Council. This board develops and schedules campus-wide programs and activities throughout the school year to meet the diverse needs of the student population. Residential Experience Council (REC) members are active in hall government, which speaks to policies and matters of concern to all campus residents.

===Traditions===
Bud the Bird
Since the 1930s Grand View students have participated in a campus tradition using &quot;Bud the Bird,&quot; a large eagle statue, as the object of desire in the school&#x27;s own version of &quot;capture the flag.&quot;

The first reports of this tradition date back to 1933, where rumor has it, a large iron eagle decoration was stolen from a nearby business. Students named this statue &quot;Bud the Bird,&quot; and over the years it was hidden and relocated on campus by different student groups. This first Bud would later be donated during World War II as scrap metal by college president, Alfred C. Nielsen, to support the war effort. The first Bud was replaced by Bud Jr., a 33-inch 200-pound replica. Sometime in the late 1940s, Bud Jr. was buried on the west end of campus, not to be unearthed again until over 50 years later in 1994 when maintenance crews were digging for fiber optic cables.

Over the years multiple Buds have been created, hidden and lost as students have competed for the honor of finding and hiding the statue.

The Rock
“The Rock,” located in front of the Humphrey Center is one of the most prominent traditions of Grand View. When re-sodding the lawn of what was then Old Main (now Humphrey Center), students in the 1900s placed the rock on the lawn directly in front of Old Main&#x27;s entrance. The only significant change made to the landmark was in 1915 when it was moved to make room for a new sidewalk to the entrance.

Students traditionally paint the rock in the darkness of the night whenever students feel the urge to express themselves. &quot;In times of celebration, sorrow, or protest, The Rock is deemed a medium of the students,&quot; a former Grand View student handbook stated. The rock is often used to announce campus events, and on at least one occasion, has been used to propose marriage.

==Notable alumni==

<doc id="861662" wikidata="Q908954" url="?curid=861662" title="Illinois House of Representatives">
<text>The Illinois House of Representatives is the lower house of the Illinois General Assembly. The body was created by the first Illinois Constitution adopted in 1818. The House under the current constitution as amended in 1980 consists of 118 representatives elected from individual legislative districts for two-year terms with no limits; redistricted every 10 years, based on the 2010 U.S. census each representative represents approximately 108,734 people.

The house has the power to pass bills and impeach Illinois officeholders. Lawmakers must be at least 21 years of age and a resident of the district in which they serve for at least two years.

President Abraham Lincoln began his career in politics in the Illinois House of Representatives.

==History==
The Illinois General Assembly was created by the first Illinois Constitution adopted in 1818. The candidates for office split into political parties in the 1830s, initially as the Democratic and Whig parties, until the Whig candidates reorganized as Republicans in the 1850s.

Abraham Lincoln began his political career in the Illinois House of Representatives as a member of the Whig party in 1834. He served there until 1842. Although Republicans held the majority of seats in the Illinois House after 1860, in the next election it returned to the Democrats. The Democratic Party-led legislature worked to frame a new state constitution that was ultimately rejected by voters After the 1862 election, the Democratic-led Illinois House of Representatives passed resolutions denouncing the federal government&#x27;s conduct of the war and urging an immediate armistice and peace convention, leading the Republican governor to suspend the legislature for the first time in the state&#x27;s history. In 1864, Republicans swept the state legislature and at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination at Ford&#x27;s Theater, Illinois stood as a solidly Republican state.

State House of Representatives elected through Cumulative voting from 1870 to 1980. The use of that system was meant to secure a degree of representation for minority blacks and the non-dominant party through use of multi-member districts and special type of multiple voting.

From 1870 to 1980, Illinois&#x27;s lower house had several unique features:
* The House had 177 members. The state was divided into 59 legislative districts, each of which elected one senator and three representatives.
* Elections for the state house were conducted using cumulative voting; each individual voter was given three votes to cast for House seats, and they could distribute them to three candidates (one vote each), one candidate (receiving three votes—this was called a bullet vote) or two candidates (each receiving 1½ votes).
* Though not constitutionally mandated, the two parties had an informal agreement that they would only run two candidates per district. Thus, in most districts, only four candidates were running for three seats. This not only all but guaranteed that the district&#x27;s minority party would win a seat (particularly outside Chicago), but usually assured that each party would have significant representation—a minimum of one-third of the seats (59 out of 177)—in the House. (The only historic exception to the minimum 59 seat rule was in 1875 and during WWI.)

===Cutback Amendment of 1980===
The Cutback Amendment was proposed to abolish Illinois&#x27;s use of Cumulative Voting and multi-member districts.

Since its passage in 1980, representatives have been elected from 118 single-member districts formed by dividing the 59 Senate districts in half, a method known as nesting. Each senator is &quot;associated&quot; with two representatives.

Since the adoption of the Cutback Amendment, there have been proposals by some major political figures in Illinois to bring back multi-member districts. A task force led by former governor Jim Edgar and former federal judge Abner Mikva issued a report in 2001 calling for the revival of cumulative voting, in part because it appears that such a system increases the representation of racial minorities in elected office. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editorialized in 1995 that the multi-member districts elected with cumulative voting produced better legislators. Others have argued that the now-abandoned system provided for greater stability in the lower house.

The Democratic Party won a majority of House seats in 1982. Except for a brief two-year period of Republican control from 1995 to 1997, the Democrats have held the majority since then.

===Firsts===
The first two African-American legislators in Illinois were John W. E. Thomas, first elected in 1876, and George French Ecton, elected in 1886. In 1922, Lottie Holman O&#x27;Neill became the first woman elected to the Illinois House of Representatives (she was elected in the first election in which women could vote or run for election). In 1958, Floy Clements became the first African American woman to serve as state Representative. In 1982, Joseph Berrios became the first Hispanic American state representative. Theresa Mah became the first Asian American to serve in the Illinois House when she was sworn into office January 10, 2017.

==Powers==
The Illinois House of Representatives meets at the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. It is required to convene on the second Wednesday of January each year. Along with the Illinois Senate and governor, it is vested with the power to make laws, come up with a state budget, act on federal constitutional amendments, and propose constitutional amendments to the state constitution. The Illinois House of Representatives also holds the power to impeach executive and judicial officials.

==Qualifications==
A person must be a U.S. citizen and two-year resident of an electoral district of at least 21 years of age to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives. Members of the House cannot hold other public offices or receive appointments by the governor while in office.

==Composition of the House==
==Leadership==
The current Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives is Emanuel Chris Welch, a Democrat from Hillside, who represents the 7th district. The Democratic Party of Illinois currently holds a super-majority of seats in the House. Under the Constitution of Illinois, the office of minority leader is recognized for the purpose of making certain appointments. Tony McCombie, of Savanna, who represents the 89th district, currently holds that post. Both leaders appointed their leadership teams shortly after the start of the 103rd General Assembly.

<doc id="861664" wikidata="Q5154343" url="?curid=861664" title="Communist Party of Canada – Manitoba">
<text>The Communist Party of Canada – Manitoba is the provincial wing of the Communist Party of Canada for the province of Manitoba. Founded in 1921, it was an illegal organization for several years and its meetings were conducted with great secrecy. Until 1924, the &quot;Workers Party&quot; functioned as its public, legal face. For a period in the 1920s, the party was associated with the Canadian Labour Party. After 1920 it attracted former members of radical and syndicalist groups such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Many of the new members were Jews, Finns or Ukrainians who supported the Russian Revolution.

Despite being a minor party since the 1960s, the party managed to field at least one candidate in all elections in Manitoba since World War II, except in 1995.

== History ==
The Workers Party ran three candidates in Winnipeg for Manitoba&#x27;s 1922 provincial election: Mathew Popovitch, Arthur Henderson and William Hammond. These candidates frequently disrupted rallies for George Armstrong, a Socialist Party incumbent. None were elected.

In the 1927 election, Jacob Penner ran as a Communist candidate in Winnipeg, which at the time elected ten members by preferential balloting. Penner&#x27;s 2015 first-preference votes were enough for an initial eighth-place finish, but he received few votes from transfers and was not elected.

In the 1932 election, Penner and Leslie Morris ran in Winnipeg as &quot;United Front Workers&quot; candidates. (The CPC had been, for all practical purposes, made illegal again in 1931). Morris finished eighth on first preferences but was unable to be elected on transfers; Penner was further behind. Communist candidates also ran in Gimli and Fisher. In the latter riding, W.N. Kolisnyk placed second against Progressive candidate Nicholas Bachynski. In 1934 it tried to organize strikes, notably copper miners at Flin Flon.

The Communist Party (once again legal) ran only one candidate in the provincial election of 1936: James Litterick in Winnipeg. In a period of increased support for the party, Litterick placed second on first-preference votes and received enough transfers from first-place candidate Lewis Stubbs to gain an easy victory. He was expelled from the legislature in 1940, after the Communist Party was once again made illegal. He subsequently went into hiding.

In the 1941 election, William Kardash (running as a &quot;Workers Party&quot; candidate) was elected for Winnipeg after placing fourth on first-preferences. Kardash was re-elected in the 1945, 1949 and 1953 elections as a member of the &quot;Labor-Progressive Party&quot; (as the Communists had renamed themselves).

Kardash led the provincial LPP from its founding in 1943 until December 1948, when he was replaced by William Cecil Ross. Ross served as leader until his retirement in 1981, and ran for provincial and federal office several times.

The party&#x27;s support base declined during the Cold War, and Kardash was the party&#x27;s only official candidate in the 1953 and 1958 elections. He was defeated on the latter occasion, after Manitoba adopted a system of single-member constituencies for Winnipeg.

The national LPP renamed itself the Communist Party in 1959, and the provincial party did the same. It now operates under the name &quot;Communist Party of Canada – Manitoba&quot;.

The CPC-M has not elected an MLA since Kardash, and became a marginal political force during the 1960s.

Joseph Zuken (1912–1986) was a Communist city councillor and school trustee in Winnipeg. His biographer says he &quot;was loved and hated in about equal measure. He was ignored by no one.&quot; He was the son of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. He ran for mayor in 1979.

Paula Fletcher became the party&#x27;s leader after Ross&#x27;s retirement in 1981, and led the party into the 1981 and 1986 elections. The party ran only two candidates on the former occasion (Fletcher and Ross), and three on the latter.

Fletcher left Manitoba for Ontario in 1986, and subsequently left the Communist Party entirely. The CPC-M was led by Lorne Robson in the provincial election of 1988, in which it ran six candidates.

Robson also moved to Ontario in the late 1980s. Frank Goldspink subsequently served as the party&#x27;s provincial organizer, and may have been its political leader as well. Goldspink was the party&#x27;s sole candidate in the 1990 election, running as an independent as the party had been de-registered.

Goldspink left the Communist Party in 1991, and the CPC-M does not appear to have had a regular leader for the next five years (although its provincial organization continued to meet on an occasional basis). The party did not run any candidates in the 1995 provincial election.

Darrell Rankin moved from Ontario to Manitoba in 1995, and became the provincial organizer of the CPC-M before the year was over. Rankin was chosen as the party&#x27;s official leader in 1996. Rankin led the CPC-M into the 1999 and 2003 elections, in which it ran six and five candidates respectively. The CPC-M was re-registered with Elections Manitoba in 1998, after a petition was presented with 3500 signatures.

Rankin faced a leadership challenge from Paul Sidon in January 2004, receiving 79% delegate support against 21% for Sidon. Rankin left the party in 2019. Organizer Andrew Taylor, a former anti-apartheid activist, trade unionist and professor, ran for the Communist Party in Winnipeg North during the 2019 federal election.

Throughout 2020, the CPC-M was vocal in criticizing Premier Brian Pallister&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a statement from the CPC-M, &quot;free market ideologues have escalated a foreseeable second wave in pursuit of profit, creating the perfect conditions for a public health disaster.&quot;

== Election results ==

Notes:

1: The party was banned under Section 98, and fielded its candidates under the &#x27;United Front&#x27; banner.

2: In 1941 the party was banned under the Defence of Canada Regulations.

3: Between 1945 and 1958 the party fielded candidates as the Labor-Progressive Party.

4: The sole candidate of the CPC (M) ran as an independent.

<doc id="861666" wikidata="Q4587616" url="?curid=861666" title="1992 Democratic National Convention">
<text>The 1992 Democratic National Convention nominated Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas for president and Senator Al Gore from Tennessee for vice president; Clinton announced Gore as his running-mate on July 9, 1992. The convention was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York from July 13 to July 16, 1992. The Clinton-Gore ticket then faced and defeated their Republican opponents, President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle as well as the independent ticket of Ross Perot and James Stockdale in the 1992 presidential election.

The convention, organized by chairman Ron Brown, was seen as a great success. Unlike some earlier Democratic conventions, it had been well planned and run with few gaffes or errors, as even Republicans conceded. As Clinton finished his acceptance speech Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, which would become the theme song of Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 campaign, was played several times during the balloon drop and celebration.

Clinton received a significant poll bounce from the convention, due to both the perceived success of the convention, as well as Ross Perot announcing he was withdrawing from the campaign just as the convention was ending (Perot got back into the race in October).

The convention bounce gave the Clinton/Gore ticket a lead that only shrank insignificantly when Ross Perot re-entered the race. Clinton and Gore went on to defeat President Bush and Vice President Quayle, as well as independent candidate Ross Perot and his running mate, James Stockdale, in the general election.

==Party platform==
The party platform was more centrist than recent preceding Democratic Party platforms had been, reflecting the new positioning of the party.

==Speakers==
New York Governor Mario Cuomo delivered the nominating speech for Clinton, hailing him as the &quot;comeback kid&quot; in reference to Clinton&#x27;s comeback in the Democratic primaries after his campaign took a hit following a loss in the New Hampshire primary and media coverage of infidelity allegations.

Prominently featured as speakers during the convention were Democratic Party women. The convention&#x27;s opening program placed a spotlight both on prominent female Democratic U.S. Senate nominees and women&#x27;s issues.

Other notable speakers included Democratic National Committee Chair Ron Brown and Elizabeth Glaser.

Former California Governor Jerry Brown, who was still an active candidate with a large amount of delegates and had not withdrawn to support the clear nominee—thus not being given a speaker&#x27;s spot by the convention organizers—addressed the convention to state his case for a &quot;humility agenda&quot; by seconding his own nomination.

===Keynote speakers===
In a departure from tradition, the convention featured three keynote speakers: Georgia Governor Zell Miller, Senator Bill Bradley and former Representative Barbara Jordan, who also served as a keynote speaker at the 1976 Democratic National Convention.

==Nomination votes==


===President===

===Vice president===
Gore was nominated by acclamation on a voice vote.

== Platform ==

=== Abortion ===
Expanding on previous support for reproductive rights, the 1992 platform for the first time explicitly supported a national law to codify &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

==Casey controversy==
Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey wanted to speak at the convention, but ultimately did not. Casey maintained that he was denied a speaking spot because he intended to give a speech about his opposition to abortion, while the Clinton camp said that Casey did not speak because he had not endorsed the Clinton/Gore ticket. After the convention was over, Casey told the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;I support the ticket. Period.&quot; Other Democrats opposing abortions such as Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Senators John Breaux and Howell Heflin, and five anti-abortion Democratic governors did speak. While Democratic officials said that these speakers were not barred from discussing their opposition to abortion, they nonetheless did not address the issue in their speeches.

Casey asked both DNC Chairman Ron Brown and Texas Governor Ann Richards, the convention&#x27;s chairwoman, for a speaking spot. Neither responded directly, and Casey later received a letter explaining that he would not receive a spot.

Controversy regarding Casey&#x27;s treatment at the 1992 Convention was frequently cited in media coverage of his son Bob Casey, Jr.&#x27;s successful 2006 Pennsylvania Senate campaign against Republican incumbent Rick Santorum.

<text>The Illinois Senate is the upper chamber of the Illinois General Assembly, the legislative branch of the government of the State of Illinois in the United States. The body was created by the first state constitution adopted in 1818. Under the Illinois Constitution of 1970, the Illinois Senate is made up of 59 senators elected from individual legislative districts determined by population and redistricted every 10 years; based on the 2020 U.S. census each senator represents approximately 213,347 people. Senators are divided into three groups, each group having a two-year term at a different part of the decade between censuses, with the rest of the decade being taken up by two four-year terms. For example, group one elects senators for terms of four years, four years and two years, group two elects senators for terms of four years, two years and four years, and group three elects senators for terms of two years, four years and four years. This ensures that the Senate reflects changes made when the General Assembly redistricts itself after each census.

Usually, depending on the election year, roughly one-third or two-thirds of Senate seats are contested. On rare occasions (usually after a census), all Senate seats are up for election. In contrast, the Illinois House of Representatives is made up of 118 members with its entire membership elected to two-year terms. House districts are formed by dividing each Senate district in half, with each senator having two &quot;associated&quot; representatives.

The Illinois Senate convenes at the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Its first official working day is the second Wednesday of January each year. Its primary duties are to pass bills into law, approve the state budget, confirm appointments to state departments and agencies, act on federal constitutional amendments and propose constitutional amendments for Illinois. It also has the power to override gubernatorial vetoes through a three-fifths majority vote. The Illinois Senate tries impeachments made by the House of Representatives, and can convict impeached officers by a two-thirds vote.

Voting in the Illinois Senate is done by members pushing one of three buttons. Unlike most states, the Illinois Senate allows members to vote yes, no, or present. It takes 30 affirmative votes to pass legislation during final action. The number of negative votes does not matter. Therefore, voting present has the same effect on the tally as voting no. Barack Obama began his political career in the Illinois Senate before going on to become President of the United States.

<doc id="861670" wikidata="Q1142888" url="?curid=861670" title="Super Mario 64 DS">
<text>Super Mario 64 DS is a 2004 platform game developed and published by Nintendo as a launch game for the Nintendo DS. &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; is a remake of the 1996 Nintendo 64 game &quot;Super Mario 64,&quot; with new graphics, characters, collectibles, a multiplayer mode, and several extra minigames. As with the original, the plot centers on rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser. Unlike the original, Yoshi is the first playable character, with Mario, Luigi, and Wario being unlockable characters in early phases of the game.

&quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, which also produced the original game. Nintendo revealed the remake as a multiplayer demonstration at E3 2004, and released it that November. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its single-player mode, graphics and the changes made from the original game. However, it was criticized for its multiplayer mode and lack of analog controls. The game is the tenth best-selling Nintendo DS game, with over 11.06 million copies sold by 2018. &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; was re-released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console service across 2015 and 2016.

== Plot ==
The game begins with Mario receiving a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. Mario arrives at Peach&#x27;s castle, along with Luigi and Wario. The trio disappear as they enter the castle, and Lakitu, the game&#x27;s camera operator, informs Yoshi of their disappearance. Yoshi explores Peach&#x27;s castle to find Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Peach.

Scattered throughout the castle are paintings and secret walls, which act as portals to other worlds where Bowser and his minions guard the Power Stars. After recovering some of the power stars and defeating Bowser&#x27;s minions, Yoshi unlocks doors that access other areas of the castle, where he finds Mario and his friends imprisoned in various rooms.

Yoshi defeats Goomboss and frees Mario as they continue searching the castle to find more Power Stars. Mario defeats King Boo and frees Luigi with the key he got from the boss, who then defeats Chief Chilly, and then frees Wario using the key he got. Mario and his friends tackle two obstacle courses, with each ensuing a battle with Bowser. After defeating him each time, they receive a key that opens more levels of the castle. Mario and his friends eventually reach the highest area of the castle and come across the endless stairs, which constantly loops when trying to climb it.

After collecting 80 Power Stars, the endless stairs&#x27; magic stops and Mario confronts Bowser alone (as he is the only one allowed to gain access to the top). After Bowser&#x27;s defeat, Mario and his friends return to Peach&#x27;s castle, where they free Peach from a stained-glass window above the entrance. As a reward for saving Peach, she kisses Mario on the nose and goes to bake the cake she had promised.

== Gameplay ==


===Controls===
The game uses both of the system&#x27;s screens to offer new options. The top screen displays the normal gameplay, while the bottom touchscreen can function as an overhead map and touch controls. The overhead map displays the current course the player traverses and displays item locations. The touch controls include virtual buttons, which rotate the top screen&#x27;s camera angle, and directional character controls, which can operate with either the DS stylus or the player&#x27;s thumb using the DS wrist strap. In addition to the single-player adventure, the game includes 36 minigames and a multiplayer mode. Minigames are made accessible by catching rabbits in the main game. All the minigames use the touchscreen to play and are based on different themes: racing, card games, puzzles, and so forth. The multiplayer mode uses the wireless DS Download Play where up to four players compete against each other using Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow Yoshi (voiced by Kazumi Totaka)—character hats appear in the stage allowing players to transform into either Mario, Luigi, or Wario. Wario can stun opponents by picking them up, swinging them around, and throwing them.

===Health, lives, and power-ups===
Power-ups in &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; take the form of special hats resembling those worn by Mario, Luigi, and Wario (all voiced by Charles Martinet), and are available in some levels. Acquiring one such hat will change the player&#x27;s character into the corresponding character, allowing the player to use that character&#x27;s abilities. The hats fall off if the character is hit, but can be reacquired. Yoshi (voiced by Kazumi Totaka) is able to start a level wearing the hat of any of the other available characters. Another power-up item, the &quot;Power Flower&quot;, provides each character with a different ability: Mario is able to float, similar to &quot;Super Mario World&quot;″s balloon item; Luigi becomes intangible and transparent, similar to the Vanish Cap in the Nintendo 64 version; Wario becomes coated by metal, which makes him temporarily invincible to enemy attacks and poison (which is purple instead of yellow as in the original version), and sink underwater, similar to the Metal Cap in the original version, but with the added ability to walk on lava instead of bouncing without taking damage; and Yoshi is able to breathe fire, which allows him to burn enemies and melt ice. Each ability is necessary to complete specific areas in the game. Other items include the &quot;Mushroom&quot;, which is a semi-rare item that greatly increases the character&#x27;s size and strength for a short period of time, and the Feather, that only Mario can get, and which allows him to fly in the same fashion as the Wing Cap in the original game. However, in multiplayer VS. Mode, other characters can get wings; in Yoshi&#x27;s case, he grows wings out of his body, like in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;.

===Setting and objective===
&quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; is a 3D platformer in which the player switches between four different characters – Yoshi, Mario, Luigi, and Wario – and controls them through numerous levels to collect 150 Power Stars, 30 more than the original game. Each character is essential to fully complete the game. Each level is an enclosed world (usually contained within and entered through a painting) in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are inhabited with enemies that attack the characters, as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask for help. The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the star in the star select menu. These challenges include defeating bosses, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As the player collects stars, more areas of the castle become accessible.

== Development ==

&quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It is a remake of the Nintendo 64 launch game &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, with the game&#x27;s 3D engine mirroring many visual effects used in the original game. Graphical changes include the lack of texture filtering, and updated versions of the character models which represented their updated, more detailed designs. Coins have been upgraded from 2D animation to 3D models. All of Koji Kondo&#x27;s music from the original game was re-used, with Kenta Nagata providing new music for the game. The voice actors from &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; returned as well, and Kazumi Totaka joined the cast, playing the role of Yoshi.

== Release and promotion ==
Originally titled &quot;Super Mario 64 ×4&quot;, the game was first shown as a multiplayer demonstration at the 2004 E3 before the Nintendo DS was released. A few months later, Nintendo announced an actual game—along with many others—was in development. At the Nintendo DS conference on October 7, 2004, the game was on demonstration again and new information was revealed; the name was changed to &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; and four different characters (Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Wario) would be used in the main, single-player adventure. The demonstration was a more complete version of the game than the E3 version—the game&#x27;s development was 90% complete at this time—and highlighted the multiple characters in the single-player mode and included minigames; the multiplayer mode, however, was not present.

Prior to the conference, the appearance of the box art on GameStop&#x27;s product page caused speculation &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; would be a launch game. Nintendo confirmed the rumor by announcing at the conference that the game would be a launch game of the Nintendo DS in North America and Japan. As the game&#x27;s release approached, the release schedule of launch games altered; many games were delayed, while others were announced to be released a few days before the Nintendo DS. &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; was the only game scheduled to be released with the system.

&quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; was first released in North America for the Nintendo DS on November 21, 2004 as a launch game for the system. On June 5, 2011, the game was repackaged in a red-colored case (along with &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, &quot;Mario Party DS&quot;, &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story&quot;, and &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!&quot;) in tandem with a price drop of $99 for the DS. &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; was later re-released in Japan for the Wii U as a part of the Virtual Console line of games on January 6, 2016, and was later released in North America in August of that year.

== Reception ==
=== Sales ===
&quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; has been commercially successful. Following its release in Japan, the game sold 241,000 copies by December 19, 2004, and was the fifth best-selling game on the weekly sales chart of that week. Sales continued to increase, and &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; had sold 639,000 units by February 20, 2005. The game frequently appeared on Amazon.com&#x27;s sales charts. In the first week of June 2006, it was listed as the sixth best-selling Nintendo DS game, and had risen to number three by the last week of the month. The game appeared again near the end of July 2006 as the eighth best-selling game. At the beginning of 2008, Amazon.com charts listed the game as the seventh best-selling Nintendo DS game in the United States. In the United States, it sold 1.4 million copies and earned $42 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the seventh highest-selling game launched for the Nintendo DS. By November 2006, the game had sold over one million units in Europe, and by the end of 2007, over two million copies in the United States. By May 31, 2011, the game had sold 4.34 million copies in the United States, and in October 2012 Nintendo reported that the game had surpassed sales of 5 million units. As of March 31, 2018, &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; has sold 11.06 million copies worldwide.

=== Critics ===
&quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; has won awards and met with &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; from video game journalists, according to review aggregator Metacritic, which assigned it a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 54 reviews, and listed it as the best Nintendo DS game of the year and 34th best Nintendo DS game of all time. Upon its release, &quot;IGN&quot; labeled it as an &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; and awarded it &quot;Game of the Month&quot; for the Nintendo DS, citing the game as a &quot;great achievement&quot; of the system&#x27;s capability. In 2005, the game won a Golden Joystick Award for best handheld game of year. Prior to the game&#x27;s release, Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; reviewed the early demonstration. He commented on the accurate recreation of the original graphics, and stated that the small Nintendo DS screen helps hide any visual flaws. Harris criticized the game&#x27;s controls calling them a little &quot;sluggish&quot; and &quot;clumsy&quot;. Though he praised the graphics and new gameplay additions, Harris expressed disappointment that the &quot;Mario&quot; launch game for the new system was a remake instead of a full game. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Anoop Gantayat anticipated the game would be a big hit among American video game enthusiasts. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; ranked &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; the 29th most wanted game.

Reviewers praised the game&#x27;s accurate recreation of the Nintendo 64 game, additional features, and upgrades. Phil Theobald of &quot;GameSpy&quot; lauded &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;, calling it &quot;fantastic&quot; and complimenting the new features: minigames, use of a second screen, and extra stars. He also commented that the gameplay of the original game holds up ten years after its original release. Harris said the original feel of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; is retained, while the new challenges and features build upon it in a way that added to the game&#x27;s longevity. He complimented the graphics and audio, and considered the game a good demonstration of the Nintendo DS&#x27;s capabilities. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; also complimented the graphics, specifically the higher polygon count and smooth frame rate. He called &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; a &quot;great update of a classic game&quot;, and felt the changes and additional features offered a new experience to fans of the original. In contrast, &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s Jeremy Parish felt the game did not offer enough new content to warrant a purchase. He praised the inclusion of extra characters, calling them a &quot;nice twist&quot;, but concluded his review by calling the game a &quot;poorly-conceived port&quot; that should be played on the original system.

Other criticism focused on the game&#x27;s controls and multiplayer mode. Theobald felt the lack of an analog stick made the controls more difficult than the original game and required a short period of adjustment. He further stated that the digital pad and touchscreen&#x27;s virtual analog control were &quot;tricky&quot; and required practice. Harris echoed similar comments and noted the touchscreen does not provide physical feedback like an analog stick. He added the game was never intended to be played without proper analog controls. Gerstmann referred to the multiplayer mode as &quot;uneventful&quot; and considered it lacking longevity, but commented that it was a good extra that demonstrated the system&#x27;s wireless multiplayer capabilities. Theobald agreed it was a nice addition, but considered it a &quot;diversion&quot; that players would tire of quickly.

During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; with &quot;Wireless Game of the Year&quot;, as well as received a nomination for &quot;Handheld Game of the Year&quot; (which was ultimately awarded to &quot;&quot;).

<doc id="861672" wikidata="Q6865457" url="?curid=861672" title="Minimum funding requirement">
<text>The Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR) was a part of United Kingdom legislation in the Pensions Act 1995, and was introduced on 6 April 1997. The Pensions Act 2004 abolishes the MFR replaces it with new &quot;statutory funding objective&quot;; this came into force on 30 December 2005 for all pension schemes with a valuation date after September 22, 2005.

The aim of the Minimum Funding Requirement was to set a minimum amount of assets that a defined benefit pension scheme should hold in order to fund its promised benefits. If a scheme did not hold sufficient assets, the pension scheme was required to achieve the minimum level within a given time scale.

For a scheme with less than 90% of the assets required, the scheme had to pay the shortfall below 90% within three years. Where the scheme was between 90% and 100%, the period was ten years.

Although legislation set out the broad requirements of the Minimum Funding Requirement, the details of the methods and assumptions to use were specified in Guidance Note 27, issued by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.

After the introduction of the Minimum Funding Requirement, there were several modifications to the assumptions to cope with perceived weaknesses in the original basis. However, the level of assets required by the MFR never proved sufficient to provide the benefits promised by the scheme which the MFR was supposed to fund. The Pensions Act 2004 abolished the MFR and introduced a new scheme funding objective hoped to adapt more flexibly to individual schemes&#x27; circumstances but at the same time protecting members&#x27; benefits. Paul Myners report states on page 4: &quot;I propose replacing the Minimum Funding Requirement, which distorts investment and fails to protect scheme members, with a long-term approach based on disclosure and openness instead of an artificial uniform yardstick.&quot;

<text>Michael John East (born 20 January 1978 in Reading, England) is a retired middle-distance athlete. His best result came in winning the 1500 metres gold medal at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England. He was the last British male to win a major 1500m title until Jake Wightman became World Champion in 2022.

He has also had some success in the IAAF European Cup finishing second and third in 2002 and 2003 respectively at the same distance. He nearly added to his medal tally when finishing third at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest, Hungary only to find himself disqualified for interfering with the run of the Kenyan Laban Rotich.

He reached the final of the 1500m at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, finishing in 6th place. He was the only British male at those Games to reach an individual athletics final on the track. He was a semi-finalist at the 2005 IAAF World Championships but missed most of the 2006 and 2007 seasons because of a knee injury. As a result, in November 2007 he had his lottery funding removed, making it much harder for him to return to top rank competition. He had to rely on financial support from two Portsmouth companies. East called the decision by UK Athletics &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;shortsighted.&quot; He returned to compete at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships but was not selected for the squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics as he could finish only 8th in the trials held in July. He announced his retirement on 8 September 2008.

<doc id="861679" wikidata="Q982229" url="?curid=861679" title="Vassili Poyarkov">
<text>Vassili Danilovich Poyarkov (Василий Данилович Поярков in Russian, – after 1668) was the first Russian explorer of the Amur region.

The Russian expansion into Siberia began with the conquest of the Khanate of Sibir in 1582. By 1639 they reached the Pacific 65 miles southeast of the mouth of the Ulya River. East of the Yenisei River there was little land fit for agriculture, except Dauria, the land between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River which was nominally controlled by China. Poyarkov was sent to explore this land.

In 1640 he was in Yakutsk as &quot;pismenyy golova&quot; (roughly, in charge of records and correspondence). In June 1643, Poyarkov with 133 men started out from Yakutsk. They were sent by the voevoda of Yakutsk, Peter Golovin. Having no idea of the proper route, Poyarkov travelled up the rivers Lena, Aldan, Uchur, Gonam. Delayed by 64 portages, it was early winter before he reached the Stanovoy watershed. Leaving 49 men to overwinter, he pushed south over the mountains in December to reach the upper Zeya River in Daur country, where he found a land of farmers with domestic animals, proper houses and Chinese trade goods who paid tribute to the Manchus who were just starting their conquest of China. He built a winter fort near the mouth of the Umelkan river. To extract supplies from the natives, he employed excessive brutality, thereby provoking their hostility and making supplies harder to get. His men survived on a diet of pine bark, stolen food, stray forest animals and native captives whom they cannibalized.

By the spring of 1644, only forty of his men were left alive. Joined now by the overwintering party, they pushed down the Zeya to the Amur. Their reputation having preceded them, they had to fight their way down the Amur through numerous ambushes. By fall they reached the Gilyak country at the mouth of the Amur. With so many enemies behind him, Poyarkov thought it unwise to return by the same route. That winter they built boats and the next spring worked their way up the Sea of Okhotsk coast to the Ulia River and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by Ivan Moskvitin six years earlier. The next spring, they followed Moskvitin&#x27;s route along the Maya River back to Yakutsk, arriving almost exactly three years after they left.

Like so many Russian explorers and colonists in Siberia, Poyarkov received no reward. His brutal treatment of Siberian natives had made enemies even among his own men. The voivode of Yakutsk sent him to Moscow for trial and an unknown fate. Whatever the authorities thought of Poyarkov himself, they were happy with the information he supplied. The next Russian expedition to the Amur was led by Yerofei Khabarov in 1650. See also Russian-Manchu border conflicts.

The 1963-built icebreaker &quot;Ledokol-4&quot; was renamed &quot;Vasiliy Poyarkov&quot; in 1996.

<text>Nautiloids are a group of marine cephalopods (Mollusca) which originated in the Late Cambrian and are represented today by the living &quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Allonautilus&quot;. Fossil nautiloids are diverse and species rich, with over 2,500 recorded species. They flourished during the early Paleozoic era, when they constituted the main predatory animals. Early in their evolution, nautiloids developed an extraordinary diversity of shell shapes, including coiled morphologies and giant straight-shelled forms (orthocones). No orthoconic and only a handful of coiled species, the nautiluses, survive to the present day.

In a broad sense, &quot;nautiloid&quot; refers to a major cephalopod subclass or collection of subclasses (Nautiloidea &quot;sensu lato). Nautiloids are typically considered one of three main groups of cephalopods, along with the extinct [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] (ammonites) and living [[Coleoidea|coleoids]] (such as [[squid]], [[octopus]], and kin). While ammonoids and coleoids are [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] [[clade]]s with exclusive ancestor-descendant relationships, this is not the case for nautiloids. Instead, nautiloids are a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] [[Evolutionary grade|grade]] of various early-diverging cephalopod lineages, including the ancestors of ammonoids and coleoids. Some authors prefer a narrower definition of Nautiloidea (Nautiloidea &quot;sensu stricto), as a singular subclass including only those cephalopods which are closer to living nautiluses than they are to either ammonoids or coleoids.

==Taxonomic relationships==
Nautiloids are among the group of animals known as cephalopods, an advanced class of mollusks which also includes ammonoids, belemnites and modern coleoids such as octopus and squid. Other mollusks include gastropods, scaphopods and bivalves.

Traditionally, the most common classification of the cephalopods has been a four-fold division (by Bather, 1888), into the orthoceratoids, nautiloids, ammonoids, and coleoids. This article is about nautiloids in that broad sense, sometimes called Nautiloidea &quot;sensu lato&quot;.

Cladistically speaking, nautiloids are a paraphyletic assemblage united by shared primitive (plesiomorphic) features not found in derived cephalopods. In other words, they are a grade group that is thought to have given rise to orthoceratoids, ammonoids and coleoids, and are defined by the exclusion of those descendent groups. Both ammonoids and coleoids have traditionally been assumed to have descended from bactritids, which in turn arose from straight-shelled orthoceratoids. The ammonoids appeared early in the Devonian period (some 400 million years ago) and became abundant in the Mesozoic era, before their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous.

Some workers apply the name Nautiloidea to a more exclusive group, called Nautiloidea &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. This taxon consists only of those orders that are clearly related to the modern nautilus to the exclusion of other modern cephalopods. In this restricted definition, membership is somewhat variable between authors, but it usually includes Tarphycerida, Oncocerida, and Nautilida.

==Shell==

All nautiloids have a large external shell, divided into a narrowing chambered region (the phragmocone) and a broad, open body chamber occupied by the animal in life. The outer wall of the shell, also known as the conch, defines its overall shape and texture. The chambers (camerae) of the phragmocone are separated from each other by thin curved walls (septa), which formed during growth spurts of the animal. During a growth spurt, the rear of the mantle secretes a new septum, adding another chamber to the series of shell chambers. At the same time, shell material is added around the shell opening (aperture), enlarging the body chamber and providing more room for the growing animal. Sutures (or suture lines) appear where each septum contacts the wall of the outer shell. In life, they are visible as a series of narrow wavy lines on the outer surface of the shell. Like their underlying septa, the sutures of the nautiloids are simple in shape, being either straight or slightly curved. This is different from the &quot;zigzag&quot; sutures of the goniatites and the highly complex sutures of the ammonites.

The septa are perforated by the siphuncle, a fleshy tube which runs through each of the internal chambers of the shell. Surrounding the fleshy tube of the siphuncle are structures made of aragonite (a polymorph of calcium carbonate – which during fossilisation is often recrystallized to calcite, a more stable form of calcium carbonate [CaCO3]): septal necks and connecting rings. Some of the earlier nautiloids deposited calcium carbonate in the empty chambers (called &quot;cameral deposits&quot;) or within the siphuncle (&quot;endosiphuncular deposits&quot;), a process which may have been connected with controlling buoyancy. The nature of the siphuncle and its position within the shell are important in classifying nautiloids and can help distinguish them from ammonoids. The siphuncle is on the shell periphery in most ammonoids whereas it runs through the center of the chambers in some nautiloids, including living nautiluses.

The subclass Nautiloidea, in its broader definition, is distinguished from other cephalopods by two main characteristics: the septa are smoothly concave in the forward direction, producing external sutures which are generally simple and smooth. The siphuncle is supported by septal necks which point to the rear (i.e. retrosiphonate) throughout the ontogeny of the animal.

Modern nautiluses have deeply coiled shells which are involute, meaning that the larger and more recent whorls overlap and obscure older whorls. The shells of fossil nautiloids may be either straight (i.e., orthoconic as in &quot;Orthoceras&quot; and &quot;Rayonnoceras&quot;), curved (as in &quot;Cyrtoceras&quot;) coiled (as in &quot;Cenoceras&quot;), or rarely a helical coil (as in &quot;Lorieroceras&quot;). Some species&#x27; shells—especially in the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic—are ornamented with spines and ribs, but most have a smooth shell. The shells are formed of aragonite, although the cameral deposits may consist of primary calcite. The coloration of the shell of the modern nautilus is quite prominent, and, although somewhat rarely, the shell coloration has been known to be preserved in fossil nautiloids. They often show color patterns only on the dorsal side, suggesting that the living animals swam horizontally.

==Modern nautiloids==
Much of what is known about the extinct nautiloids is based on what we know about modern nautiluses, such as the chambered nautilus, which is found in the southwest Pacific Ocean from Samoa to the Philippines, and in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia. It is not usually found in waters less than deep and may be found as far down as .

Nautili are free swimming animals that possess a head with two simple lens-free eyes and arms (or tentacles). They have a smooth shell over a large body chamber, which is divided into subchambers filled with an inert gas (similar to the composition of atmospheric air, but with more nitrogen and less oxygen) making the animal neutrally buoyant in the water. As many as 90 tentacles are arranged in two circles around the mouth. The animal is predatory, and has jaws which are horny and beak-like, allowing it to feed on crustaceans.

Empty nautilus shells may drift a considerable distance and have been reported from Japan, India and Africa. Undoubtedly the same applies to the shells of fossil nautiloids, the gas inside the shell keeping it buoyant for some time after the animal&#x27;s death, allowing the empty shell to be carried some distance from where the animal lived before finally sinking to the seafloor.

Nautili propel themselves by jet propulsion, expelling water from an elongated funnel called the hyponome, which can be pointed in different directions to control their movement. Unlike the belemnites and other cephalopods, modern nautili do not have an ink sac, and there is no evidence to suggest that the extinct forms possessed one either. Furthermore, unlike the extinct ammonoids, the modern nautilus lacks an aptychus, a biomineralized plate which is proposed to act as an operculum which closes the shell to protect the body. However, aptychus-like plates are known from some extinct nautiloids, and they may be homologous to the fleshy hood of a modern nautilus.

==Fossil record==

Nautiloids are often found as fossils in early Palaeozoic rocks (less so in more recent strata).

The rocks of the Ordovician period in the Baltic coast and parts of the United States contain a variety of nautiloid fossils, and specimens such as &quot;Discitoceras&quot; and &quot;Rayonnoceras&quot; may be found in the limestones of the Carboniferous period in Ireland. The marine rocks of the Jurassic period in Britain often yield specimens of &quot;Cenoceras&quot;, and nautiloids such as &quot;Eutrephoceras&quot; are also found in the Pierre Shale formation of the Cretaceous period in the north-central United States.

Specimens of the Ordovician nautiloid &quot;Endoceras&quot; have been recorded measuring up to in shell length, and there is a description of a specimen estimated to have reached , although that specimen is reported as destroyed. These large nautiloids would have been formidable predators of other marine animals at the time they lived.

In some localities, such as Scandinavia and Morocco, the fossils of orthoconic nautiloids accumulated in such large numbers that they form limestones composed of nonspecific assemblages known as &quot;cephalopod beds&quot;, &quot;cephalopod limestones&quot;, &quot;nautiloid limestones&quot;, or &quot;Orthoceras limestones&quot; in the geological literature. Although the term &quot;Orthoceras&quot; now only refers to a Baltic coast Ordovician genus, in prior times it was employed as a general name given to all straight-shelled nautiloids that lived from the Ordovician to the Triassic periods (but were most common in the early Paleozoic era).

==Evolutionary history==
Nautiloids are first known from the late Cambrian Fengshan Formation of northeastern China, where they seem to have been quite diverse (at the time this was a warm shallow sea rich in marine life). However, although four orders have been proposed from the 131 species named, there is no certainty that all of these are valid, and indeed it is likely that these taxa are seriously oversplit.


Most of these early forms died out, but a single family, the Ellesmeroceratidae, survived to the early Ordovician, where it ultimately gave rise to all subsequent cephalopods. In the Early and Middle Ordovician the nautiloids underwent an evolutionary radiation. Some eight new orders appeared at this time, covering a great diversity of shell types and structure, and ecological lifestyles.

Nautiloids remained at the height of their range of adaptations and variety of forms throughout the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods, with various straight, curved and coiled shell forms coexisting at the same time. Several of the early orders became extinct over that interval, but others rose to prominence.

Nautiloids began to decline in the Devonian, perhaps due to competition with their descendants and relatives the Ammonoids and Coleoids, with only the Nautilida holding their own (and indeed increasing in diversity). Their shells became increasingly tightly coiled, while both numbers and variety of non-nautilid species continued to decrease throughout the Carboniferous and Permian.

The massive extinctions at the end of the Permian were less damaging to nautiloids than to other taxa and a few groups survived into the early Mesozoic, including pseudorthocerids, bactritids, nautilids and possibly orthocerids. The last straight-shelled forms were long thought to have disappeared at the end of the Triassic, but a possible orthocerid has been found in Cretaceous rocks. Apart from this exception, only a single nautiloid suborder, the Nautilina, continued throughout the Mesozoic, where they co-existed quite happily with their more specialised ammonoid cousins. Most of these forms differed only slightly from the modern nautilus. They had a brief resurgence in the early Tertiary (perhaps filling the niches vacated by the ammonoids in the end Cretaceous extinction), and maintained a worldwide distribution up until the middle of the Cenozoic Era. With the global cooling of the Miocene and Pliocene, their geographic distribution shrank and these hardy and long-lived animals declined in diversity again. Today there are only six living species, all belonging to two genera, &quot;Nautilus&quot; (the pearly nautilus), and &quot;Allonautilus&quot;.

The recent decrease in the once worldwide distribution of nautiloids is now believed to have been caused by the spread of pinnipeds. From the Oligocene onward, the appearance of pinnipeds in the geological record of a region coincides with the disappearance of nautiloids from that region. As a result, nautiloids are now limited to their current distribution in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, where pinnipeds are absent. The genus &quot;Aturia&quot; seem to have temporarily survive regions where pinnipeds were present through adaptations to fast and agile swimming, but eventually went extinct as well. Predation by short-snouted whales and the development of OMZs, preventing nautiloids from retreating into deeper water, are also cited as other potential causes of extinction.

===Timeline of orders===

==Classification==
=== Older classification systems ===
A consensus on nautiloid classification has traditionally been elusive and subject to change, as different workers emphasize different fundamental traits when reconstructing evolutionary events. The largest and most widely cited publication on nautiloid taxonomy is the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Part K by Teichert et al. 1964, though new information has rendered this volume outdated and in need of revision. Treatise Part K was based on previous classification schemes by Flower &amp; Kummel (1950) and the Russian &quot;Osnovy Paleontologii Vol. 5&quot; (1962) textbook.

Other comprehensive taxonomic schemes have been devised by Wade (1988), Teichert (1988), and Shevyrev (2006). Wade (1988) divided the subclass Nautiloidea (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) into 6 superorders, incorporating orders that are phylogenetically related. They are:
*†Plectronoceratoidea = †Plectronocerida, †Protactinocerida, †Yanhecerida, and †Ellesmerocerida.
*†Endoceratoidea = †Endocerida
*†Orthoceratoidea = †Orthocerida, †Ascocerida, and †Pseudorthocerida (the Orthoceratoidea of Kröger 2007)
*Nautilitoidea = †Tarphycerida, †Oncocerida, and Nautilida.
*†Actinoceratoidea = †Actinocerida
*†Discosoritoidea = †Discosorida

Three of these superorders were established for orders of uncertain placement: Endocerida, Actinocerida, and Discosorida. The other three unite related orders which share a common ancestor and form a branch of the nautiloid taxonomic tree: Plectronoceratoidea, which consists mostly of small Cambrian forms that include the ancestors of subsequent stocks; Orthoceratoidea, which unites different primarily orthoconic orders (including the ancestors for Bacritida and Ammonoidea); and Nautilitoidea, which includes the first coiled cephalopods, Tarphycerida, as well as Nautilida, which includes the recent &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Another order, Bactritida, which is derived from Orthocerida, is sometimes included with Nautiloidea, sometimes with Ammonoidea, and sometimes placed in a subclass of its own, Bactritoidea.

Recently some workers in the field have come to recognize Dissidocerida as a distinct order, along with Pseudorthocerida, both previously included in Orthocerida as subtaxa.

=== Early cladistic efforts ===
Cladistic approaches are rare in nautiloid systematics. Many nautiloid orders (not to mention the group as a whole) are not monophyletic clades, but rather paraphyletic grades. This means that they include some descendant taxa while excluding others. For example, the paraphyletic order Orthocerida includes numerous orthocerids stretching through the Paleozoic, but it excludes colloids, despite colloids having a well-established ancestry among the orthocerids. Interpretations by Engeser (1996–1998) suggests that nautiloids, and indeed cephalopods in general, should be split into two main clades: Palcephalopoda (including all the nautiloids except Orthocerida and Ascocerida) and Neocephalopoda (the rest of the cephalopods). Palcephalopoda is meant to correspond to groups which are closer to living nautilus, while Neocephalopoda is meant to correspond to groups closer to living coleoids. One issue which this scheme is the necessity of establishing a firm ancestry for nautilus, to contextualize which cephalopods are closer to which of the two living end members. On the basis of morphological traits, Nautilida is most similar to coiled early nautiloids such as the Tarphycerida and Oncocerida. However, these orders diverged from coleoid ancestors in the early Ordovician at the latest, while genetic divergence estimates suggest that Nautilida diverged in the Silurian or Devonian.

A more recent phylogenetic study by Lindgren &quot;et al.&quot; (2004), which supports the monophyly of cephalopods, does not bear on the Palcephalopod/Neocephalopod question, since the only cephalopods included were &quot;Nautilus&quot; and coleoids.

=== Recent revisions ===
For an in-process revision of Treatise Part K, King &amp; Evans (2019) reclassified nautiloids &quot;sensu lato&quot; into five subclasses. Major groups were primarily defined by variation in their muscle attachment types. Other traits referenced during this reclassification include protoconch morphology, connecting ring structure, and the extent of cameral and endosiphuncular deposits. While most previous studies referred to subclasses with the suffix &#x27;-oidea&#x27;, these authors instead opted for the suffix &#x27;-ia&#x27;, to prevent confusion between group levels. For example, Nautiloidea &quot;sensu stricto&quot; was renamed to Nautilia, to differentiate it from the informal broader definition of &quot;nautiloid&quot;. In addition, they used the unsimplified names for orders, with the suffix &#x27;-atida&#x27; rather than the common simplified form, &#x27;-ida&#x27;.

* Subclass †Plectronoceratia (formerly Plectronoceratoidea)
** Order †Plectronoceratida
** Order †Yanheceratida
** Order †Protactinoceratida
* Subclass †Multiceratia (formerly Multiceratoidea)
** Order †Ellesmeroceratida
** Order †Cyrtocerinida
** Order †Bisonoceratida
** Order †Oncoceratida
** Order †Discosorida
* Subclass †Tarphyceratia
** Order †Tarphyceratida
** Order †Ascoceratida
* Subclass Nautilia (formerly Nautiloidea &quot;sensu stricto&quot;)
** Order Nautilida
* Subclass †Orthoceratia (formerly Orthoceratoidea)
** Order †Rioceratida
** Order †Dissidoceratida
** Order †Orthoceratida
** Order †Pseudorthoceratida
** Order †Actinoceratida
** Order †Astroviida (suborders †Lituitina and †Pallioceratina)
** Order †Endoceratida

Traditional nautiloid classification schemes emphasize certain character traits over others, potentially involving personal bias as to which traits are worth emphasizing according to different authors. This issue may be resolved by sampling all morphological traits equally through bayesian phylogenetic inference. The first cephalopod-focused paper to use this technique was published by Pohle et al. (2022). They recovered several previously hypothesized groups, though many orders were determined to be paraphyletic. The study was focused on early cephalopod diversification in the Late Cambrian and Ordovician, and did not discuss in detail the origin of post-Ordovician groups. The following is a simplified version of their cladogram, showing early cephalopod relationships to the order level (although various isolated families also originated during this diversification event):

<text>Royal Air Force Cranwell or more simply RAF Cranwell is a Royal Air Force station in Lincolnshire, England, close to the village of Cranwell, near Sleaford. Among other functions, it is home to the Royal Air Force College (RAFC), which trains the RAF&#x27;s new officers and aircrew. The motto, &quot;Altium Altrix&quot;, meaning &quot;Nurture the highest&quot; appears above the main doors of the Officers Mess. Since January 2023, RAF Cranwell has been commanded by Group Captain Tina Jessup.

==History==
The history of military aviation at Cranwell goes back to November 1915, when the Admiralty requisitioned 2,500 acres (10 km2) of land from the Marquess of Bristol&#x27;s estate. On 1 April 1916, the &quot;Royal Naval Air Service Training Establishment, Cranwell&quot; was officially born.

In 1917 a dedicated railway station was established for the RNAS establishment on a new single track branch line from Sleaford, the train being known as The Cranwell Flyer.

With the establishment of the Royal Air Force as an independent service in 1918, the RNAS Training Establishment became RAF Cranwell. The Royal Air Force College Cranwell was formed on 1 November 1919 as the RAF (Cadet) College.

==Role and operations==

=== Royal Air Force College ===
Cranwell is home to the Royal Air Force College (RAFC), which oversees all RAF phase 1 Training. The RAF Officer Training Academy (RAFOTA) is the sub organisation of the RAFC which trains the RAFs new officers on a 24-week Modular Initial Officer Training Course (MIOTC), after which they are dispersed to their Phase II training for specific branch instruction. It is thus the RAF equivalent of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst or the Britannia Royal Naval College.

=== RAF Recruitment ===
The station is home to the Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre (OASC), where all applicants to the RAF as officers or non-commissioned aircrew, are put through a rigorous selection process.

===Headquarters Central Flying School===
HQ CFS has been located at RAF Cranwell since 1995 when it moved from RAF Scampton. The Central Flying School currently trains all RAF QFI flying instructors.

=== No. 3 Flying Training School ===
Cranwell is home to the headquarters of No. 3 Flying Training School (No. 3 FTS). The school provides elementary flying training for fixed wing and multi-engine student pilots from the RAF and Fleet Air Arm through No. 57 (Reserve) Squadron and No. 703 Naval Air Squadron. The UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) operates the Grob Prefect T1 in this role. Although nominally based at Cranwell, elementary training largely takes place at nearby RAF Barkston Heath. After elementary training, aircrews streamed to fly multi-engine aircraft and rear-seat roles are trained by No. 45(R) Squadron, which operate five Embraer Phenom 100.

On 16 January 2018, the Skyes Building was opened at Cranwell by Air Marshal Sean Reynolds, the Deputy Commander Capability and Senior Responsible Owner of the UKMFTS. The building acts as a UKMFTS operational support building and is used to train new RAF pilots. It was named after Air-Vice Marshal Sir Frederick Hugh Sykes, a British military officer and politician who served during the First World War.

=== Air Cadets ===
Since the mid-1990s, Cranwell has been home to Headquarters, Air Cadets, and the Air Cadet Organisation&#x27;s Adult Training Facility.

The RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine, which consists of three wings: Aviation Medicine Wing, Occupational and Environmental Medicine Wing, and Support Wing, will re-locate from RAF Henlow to RAF Cranwell by 2026. The equipment being relocated includes: &quot;aircraft cockpit rigs; hypobaric chambers, which simulate the effect of high altitude on the body; hypoxia training rigs; and helmet-testing gear.&quot;

The Recruit Training Squadron, which delivers the Basic Recruit Training Course (Phase 1) to all Royal Air Force recruits, is planned to relocate from RAF Halton, which is due to close in 2027, to RAF Cranwell in December 2025.

<text>Caspar (or Gaspar) Netscher (1639 – January 15, 1684) was a Dutch portrait and genre painter. He was a master in depicting oriental rugs, silk and brocade and introduced an international style to the Northern Netherlands.

==Life==
According to Arnold Houbraken&#x27;s 17th-century biographical study of Dutch painters he was born in Heidelberg or Prague. His father Johann Netscher was a sculptor from Stuttgart. The elder Netscher married Elizabet Vetter, the daughter of a mayor in Heidelberg, against her father&#x27;s wishes. He died in Poland when Caspar was two years of age. It has been suggested that Caspar may have been the son of a Rotterdam painter. When Heidelberg was attacked during the civil war, Caspar&#x27;s mother fled with four children to an estate outside the city. When the castle was laid under siege, the people there suffered from hunger and Caspar&#x27;s two older brothers died. Caspar&#x27;s mother fled in the night, carrying the young Caspar in her arms and with her young daughter on foot, staying at almshouses for widows and orphans. They travelled in this way to Arnhem, where they finally found safe quarter. In Arnhem Caspar was adopted by a rich physician named A. Tullekens. At first he was destined for the profession of his patron, but owing to his great aptitude for painting he was placed under a local artist named Hendrick Coster, and through the acquaintance of Wynant Everwyn in 1654, who had family connections to Tullekens, he became a student of Ter Borch in Deventer. He was Ter Borch&#x27;s most gifted pupil, probably worked as an assistant as well and he appears several times as a model on Ter Borch&#x27;s paintings.
When he came of age, he first worked for the Dutch &quot;keelbeulen&quot; (Houbraken called art dealers &quot;cutthroats&quot;) until he had enough money to make a grand tour. In 1658 he set out for Italy to complete his education, booking passage on a ship to Bordeaux with letters of introduction from Tullekens for his cousin Neny there. From Bordeaux he planned to proceed overland to Italy. However, while in Bordeaux he met the mathematician and fountain designer Godijn, and married his daughter Margaretha Godijn on 25 November 1659, which halted his progress to Rome. In Bordeaux he toiled hard to earn a livelihood by painting small cabinet pictures which are now highly valued on account of their exquisite finish. Fearing the persecutions of Protestants, after his son was born he moved back North to The Hague in 1662, and turned his attention to portrait-painting. In this branch of his art, he was more successful. In 1668 he joined the Schutterij and Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, traveling through the Netherlands bought four paintings.

It is likely that Netscher knew the painters Frans van Mieris, Sr. (1635?–1681) and Gerard Dou, but it is certain that he knew the painter Gerrit de Hooch from The Hague as his wife gave her name to Gerrit&#x27;s new born daughter Margarita in 1676, the event being witnessed by Caspar as well as his wife. He was patronized by William III, and his earnings soon enabled him to gratify his own taste by depicting musical and conversational pieces.

It was in these that Netscher&#x27;s genius was fully displayed. The choice of these subjects, and the habit of introducing female figures, dressed in glossy satins, were imitated from Ter Borch; they possess easy yet delicate pencilling, brilliant and correct colouring, and pleasing light and shade; but frequently their refinement passes into weakness. The painter was gaining both fame and wealth when he began to suffer from gout and took to his bed, where he continued to paint lying down and died prematurely in 1684, in The Hague. His sons Constantyn (1668–1722), and Theodorus (1661–1732), were also painters after their father&#x27;s style, who Houbraken meant to include in his 4th volume of painters. He was also the father of Anthonie Netscher who emigrated to Batavia. According to the RKD, his registered pupils in the Confrerie Pictura besides his three sons were Johannes van den Brande, Otto Brandt, Olivier van Deuren, Jacob van der Does the younger, Van Hardenbroeck, Daniël Haringh, Mouritz van der Linden, J. Spick, Jan Tilius and Aleida Wolfsen.

<text>Sir William Tyrone Guthrie (2 July 1900 – 15 May 1971) was an English theatrical director instrumental in the founding of the Stratford Festival of Canada, the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the Tyrone Guthrie Centre at his family&#x27;s ancestral home, &quot;Annaghmakerrig&quot;, near Newbliss in County Monaghan, Ireland. He is famous for his original approach to Shakespearean and modern drama.

==Early life==
Guthrie was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, the son of Dr. Thomas Clement Guthrie (a grandson of the Scottish preacher Thomas Guthrie) and Norah Power. His mother was the daughter of Sir William James Tyrone Power, Commissary-General-in-chief of the British Army from 1863 to 1869 and Martha, daughter of Dr. John Moorhead of Annaghmakerrig House and his Philadelphia-born wife, Susan (née Allibone) Humphreys.

His great-grandfather was Irish actor Tyrone Power and he was a second cousin of famed film actor Tyrone Power. Guthrie&#x27;s sister, Susan Margaret, married his close university friend, fellow Anglo-Irishman Hubert Butler. Tyrone Guthrie received a degree in history at Oxford University, where he was active in student theatre, and worked for a season at the newly established Oxford Playhouse.

==Career==
In 1924 Guthrie joined the BBC as a broadcaster and began to produce plays for radio. This led to a year directing for the stage with the Scottish National Players, before returning to the BBC to become one of the first writers to create plays designed for radio performance. From 1929–33, he directed at various theatres, including the Cambridge Festival Theatre in 1929 and a production of Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; at the Westminster Theatre in 1932. His work in London at the Old Vic and the Sadler’s Wells theatres earned him acknowledgment as a significant director.

During 1933–34, and again from 1936–45, he was director of the Shakespeare Repertory Company. While in Montreal, Guthrie produced the &quot;Romance of Canada&quot; series of radio plays for recalling epic moments in Canadian history. The series was broadcast on the Canadian National Railway radio network. Hubert Butler translated the text for Guthrie&#x27;s 1934 production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Orchard&quot;, for perhaps its first English-language production. In the late 1930s, he worked in London and appeared in the first two motion pictures produced by Charles Laughton&#x27;s independent film production company, Mayflower Pictures. The films were &quot;Vessel of Wrath&quot; and &quot;St. Martin&#x27;s Lane&quot;, both released in 1938.

In the 1940s Guthrie began to direct operas, to critical acclaim, including a realistic &quot;Carmen&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells and the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He also returned to Scotland where, with James Bridie in 1948, he staged the first modern adaptation, by Robert Kemp, of Sir David Lyndsay&#x27;s grand-scale medieval comedy &quot;Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis&quot; for the Second Edinburgh International Festival; a landmark event in the modern revival of Scottish theatre. It was staged in the city&#x27;s General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Mound, specially adapted for the occasion. He directed the play again in Edinburgh in 1959.

===Stratford Festival of Canada===
In 1952, he was invited to help launch the Stratford Festival of Canada. Intrigued with the idea of starting a Shakespeare theatre in a remote Canadian location, he enlisted Tanya Moiseiwitsch to further develop his thrust stage design, successfully improvised in Edinburgh, and actors Alec Guinness and Irene Worth to star in the inaugural production of &quot;Richard III&quot;. All performances in the first seasons took place in a large tent on the banks of the Avon River. He remained as Artistic Director for three seasons, and his work at Stratford had a strong influence in the development of Canadian theatre.

Guthrie produced Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in 1960 and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; in 1961, which were televised in Canada and also brought to the Phoenix Theatre in New York and on tour in the US. In 1962, as soon as the Gilbert and Sullivan copyrights expired, he brought these productions to Britain; they soon played at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and were broadcast by the BBC. They were among the first Savoy opera productions in Britain not authorized by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company.

===Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota===
In 1963, he founded the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, designed by Ralph Rapson. He published a small invitation in 1959 in the drama page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; soliciting communities&#x27; interest and involvement in a resident theater. From that beginning, the Twin Cities was chosen and the Guthrie Theater was established, with construction being completed in 1963. Guthrie served as Artistic Director until 1966, and continued to direct at the theater he founded until 1969, two years before his death.

===Legacy===
In the prologue to his biography, James Forsyth wrote, &quot;Anti-Broadway, anti-West End, anti everything implied in the term &#x27;Legitimate Theatre&#x27;, he ended up with a legitimate claim to the title of &#x27;most important, British-born theatre director of his time. Sir Peter Hall wrote, &quot;Among the great originators in British Theatre...Guthrie was a towering figure in every sense. He blazed a trail for the subsidised theatre of the sixties. He showed how to run a company and administer a theatre. And he was a brilliant and at times great director...&quot; Guthrie wrote two major books about the creation of effective drama: &quot;Theatre Prospect&quot; (1932) and &quot;A Life in the Theatre&quot; (1959).

Guthrie&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Life in the Theatre&quot;, was adapted into a stage play, &quot;Guthrie on Guthrie&quot; by Margaret Dale. It was produced at the Stratford Festival in 1989, and again at the Glenn Gould Studio in 1998 for recording as an audiobook. Both productions featured Colin Fox as Guthrie.

===Queen&#x27;s University Belfast===
He was Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (1963–70). On 15 September 2010, a blue plaque in his memory was unveiled at the BBC in Belfast by the Ulster History Circle.

==Personal life==
In 1931, Guthrie married Judith Bretherton, who survived him by only a year. He was knighted in 1961, and died a decade later at his home, Annaghmakerrig, in Newbliss, County Monaghan, Ireland, aged 70, from a heart attack. His body was buried in the graveyard of Aghabog Church of Ireland, in Newbliss.

<doc id="861690" wikidata="Q493456" url="?curid=861690" title="Withers">
<text>Withers are the ridge between the shoulder blades of an animal, typically a quadruped. In many species, this ridge is the tallest point of the body. In horses and dogs, it is the standard place to measure the animal&#x27;s height. In contrast, cattle are often measured to the top of the hips.

The term (pronounced ) derives from Old English &quot;wither&quot; (&quot;against&#x27;), because the withers are the part of a draft animal that pushes against a load.

==Horses==
The withers in horses are formed by the dorsal spinal processes of roughly the 3rd through 11th thoracic vertebrae, which are unusually long in this area. Most horses have 18 thoracic vertebrae. The processes at the withers can be more than long.

Since they do not move relative to the ground as the horse&#x27;s head does, the withers are used as the measuring point for the height of a horse. Horses are sometimes measured in hands – one hand is . Horse heights are extremely variable, from small pony breeds to large draft breeds. The height at the withers of an average thoroughbred is , and ponies are up to .

===Conformational issues===
The withers of the horse are considered in evaluating conformation. Generally, a horse should have well-defined withers, as they are considered an important attachment point for the muscles of the torso. Withers of medium height are preferred, as high withers make it difficult to fit a saddle and are often associated with a narrow chest, and low withers (known as &quot;mutton withers&quot;) do not provide a ridge to help keep the saddle in place.

More importantly, the dorsal spinal processes provide an attachment for the muscles that support the shoulder and neck. Horses do not have a clavicle, so the shoulder can freely rotate backwards. If the vertebrae of the withers are long front-to-back, the shoulder is freer to move backwards. This allows for an increase of stride length. thus increasing the horse&#x27;s speed. It is also important in jumping, as the shoulder must rotate back for the horse to bring its foreleg parallel to the ground, which will then raise the animal&#x27;s knees upward and get the lower part of the forelegs out of the way. Therefore, the withers have a direct impact on one of the most important points of conformation: the shoulder.

==Dogs==
In dogs, the height of the withers is often used to determine the dog&#x27;s jump height in various dog sports. It is also often a determining factor in whether the dog conforms to the show-quality standards for its breed.

<doc id="861695" wikidata="Q7052818" url="?curid=861695" title="Norman Stanley Fletcher">
<text>Norman Stanley Fletcher, commonly nicknamed &quot;Fletch&quot;, is the main fictional character in the BBC sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;, and the spin-off, &quot;Going Straight&quot;. He was played by Ronnie Barker.

In the pilot episode, Fletcher claims to Mr. Barrowclough that he was sentenced for stealing a truck, which then crashed through garden walls and a toolshed when its brakes failed. This turns out to be a shaggy dog story leading up to the punchline &quot;I asked for six other fences to be taken into consideration&quot;. In other episodes, it is stated that he was sentenced for breaking and entering and that he is a career burglar. The opening of each episode refers to Fletcher as a &quot;habitual criminal.&quot;

His tactics range from the practical (stealing pills from the prison doctor and eggs from the prison farmyard), to the symbolic (finding new and imaginative ways to stick two fingers up at Mackay, the antagonist prison officer, and get away with it). In return, Mackay&#x27;s frenzied, neurotic attempts to catch Fletcher out, when fruitful, give the warder a level of smugness and satisfaction that is only accentuated by his charge&#x27;s hostility and skulking.

Fletch is also surprised when this spell in prison finds him taking on the role of father figure. It is left to him to help Warren when he needs a letter read or written and to oversee new, younger inmates such as McClaren and Godber.

Fletch is manipulative and can play upon the sympathies and weaknesses of people like the liberal warden, Mr. Barrowclough, and the ineffectual prison governor to acquire more pleasant employment, accommodation, or special privileges.

Fletcher was born, in his words, &quot;two-two-thirty-two&quot; - 2 February 1932. He is a native of Muswell Hill. His elder daughter Ingrid was conceived in Highgate Cemetery, shortly before his marriage to Isobel at the age of 19. He also has a younger daughter Marion and a son named Raymond. Fletcher did his post-war National Service in the early 1950s, including service in the Malayan Emergency. He joined the Royal Army Service Corps or RASC, which he refers to in army slang as &quot;Run Away, Someone&#x27;s Coming&quot;. He was &quot;King of the Teds&quot; in Muswell Hill, circa 1955, and retains fond memories of Gloria, a seamstress with whom he had an affair at that time, and who used to tighten his trousers for him.

Upon release from prison, Fletch decided to give up his criminal career. In the follow-up series, &quot;Going Straight&quot;, he took a job as a hotel night-porter but found himself often tempted back into crime, although he resisted. His wife, Isobel, had left him, leaving him in sole charge of Raymond.

When last seen, in the mockumentary &quot;Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;, Fletch was the landlord of a pub in Muswell Hill, alongside his second wife, Gloria (an old flame briefly mentioned in &quot;Porridge&quot;).

In 2009, the character was revived in a stage production, penned by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and is played by Shaun Williamson.

In the 2016 revival of the show, also titled &quot;Porridge&quot;, it is revealed that Fletcher died circa 2011.

==Personality and traits==
For a man of his age and poor education, Fletch is highly intelligent. He speaks with confidence and a large vocabulary on a wide range of topics including politics, race relations, the justice system, and society in general. It appears he possesses a considerable degree of natural intellect. He is a tolerant man who briefly dabbled in Marxist politics in his youth but is often cynical about the world and generally pessimistic. His attitude never goes beyond simple complaining and playful teasing of Mr. Mackay, although Fletch occasionally shows a darker side which reflects his true mental state, usually when he is talking about his past. The large amount of time he has spent in prison has left him feeling that he has wasted his life. In the final episode of &quot;Going Straight&quot;, he is convinced not to return to crime after walking into a pet shop and seeing the animals in cages, reminding him of his time in prison. He struggles to adapt to life on the outside after his spell in Slade prison, and his frayed nerves have resulted in a quick temper, shown by how quick he is to shout at his daughter Ingrid. He is also something of a drinker - on one occasion, after sneaking away from an outdoor trip, he goes straight to a pub and drinks several pints of beer, one of which he downs in one. In &quot;Going Straight&quot;, he consumes several pints of beer and a few whisky chasers just on the train from Carlisle to London. He mentions that an &quot;average day&quot; in Muswell Hill involved visiting four different pubs for a &quot;swift half&quot;. He is upset that his wife Isobel has left him and struggles to cope with the responsibility of holding his family together.

Fletch is a Tottenham Hotspur supporter; in &#x27;Porridge&#x27; S1E6, Fletch tells an inmate that he spent a weekend on compassionate leave &quot;in the pub,&quot; &quot;eating roast beef,&quot; and &quot;watching Spurs win at home.&quot; In &quot;Going Straight&quot; S1E1 he collects his personal possessions upon his release from the prison which includes a Tottenham Hotspur key chain. The Fletch character may have a second team, though, since in the film version of &#x27;Porridge&#x27; he says he&#x27;s supported Leyton Orient for 20 years, and in &#x27;Going Straight&#x27; S1E3 he plans to attend a match between Orient and Mansfield Town, hoping that Orient &quot;might just scrape a point.&quot;

<doc id="861697" wikidata="Q2879311" url="?curid=861697" title="Coimbra Academic Association">
<text>The Associação Académica de Coimbra (AAC) is the students&#x27; union of the University of Coimbra (UC). Founded in Coimbra on November 3, 1887, it is the oldest students&#x27; union in Portugal. It is also the biggest Portuguese students&#x27; union belonging to an independent institution, since it represents all the students of its university, who gain automatic membership into the AAC as students of the University of Coimbra (25,580 students as of 2021).

In addition to several departments dedicated to culture and student life, ranging from theatre and musical groups to radio and cinematography, the AAC has several sports&#x27; departments (called sections) based in Coimbra. All teams and athletes of the AAC sports departments bear the same name and logo with black uniforms. This is one of the largest multi-sports clubs of Portugal. The Associação Académica de Coimbra - O.A.F., an autonomous football organization inside the AAC, houses one of its better known teams across Portugal due to a historical presence on the main Portuguese Football Championships and the popularity of football in the country. Despite that, the Associação Académica de Coimbra - S.F. (sports section) is also in operation as a student-only football team of AAC which has been playing in the lower, regional football leagues. In rugby (Portuguese Rugby Union Championship), volleyball (Portuguese Volleyball Championship) and basketball (Portuguese Basketball League (LCB)) top flight competitions, through the Associação Académica de Coimbra (rugby union), the Associação Académica de Coimbra (volleyball) and the Associação Académica de Coimbra (basketball) departments, the AAC has also been represented at the highest level in the Portuguese major competitions across its history, as well as in several olympic sports ranging from athletics to martial arts disciplines. The chess team has been Portuguese champion on several occasions.

==History==
The Associação Académica de Coimbra was predated by several older student organisations, for example the Orfeon Académico de Coimbra (1880). This choir remains as an autonomous entity within the association. The Associação Académica was founded on the base of the student dramatic society, the Academia Dramática de Coimbra (1849-1887). The main mover was António Luís Gomes, a law student. In 1971, student protests against policies of the Estado Novo regime led to the Associação Académica being closed down, preceding a round of repression.

==Organization==
The AAC is governed by a &quot;D.G. - Direcção Geral&quot; (Directorate-General, the main board) made up entirely of students of the University of Coimbra; yearly elections take place to name the members of this board, any student can sign up to be a candidate. All the students of UC are entitled to vote for the AAC board. The current president of the main board is João Assunção.

Since the late 1990s inside the AAC structure have been created several local student unions, representing courses, departments or sometimes faculties/colleges. Known as “Núcleos” (Portuguese for nucleus), these semi-independent unions have their own elected internal organs. All of them represent a major role in the AAC political, cultural, sportive and social life. In 2008 the AAC comprehended 25 of such unions, of which NEFLUC (Students union of the Faculty of Letters) is the biggest, representing nearly 3000 students.

The main building of the Coimbra&#x27;s Academic Association was inaugurated in 1961 and holds the offices of many sports clubs &quot;(secções desportivas)&quot; and arts sections &quot;(secções culturais)&quot;. There are also rehearsal halls, a medical centre, academic services, extensive indoor gardens, a theatre-cinema with approximately 1,000 seats (&quot;Teatro Académico de Gil Vicente&quot;), and a café–restaurant where many students meet up and enjoy a wide selection of foods. AAC is the umbrella organization for a number of autonomous entities, the &quot;organismos autónomos&quot;.

Some of its better known former members include Salgado Zenha, Manuel Alegre, António de Almeida Santos, Miguel Torga, António Nobre, Vergílio Ferreira, Zeca Afonso, and Adriano Correia de Oliveira.

In addition, the AAC is the organizing and regulating body of the typical student &quot;Praxe&quot; (Praxis) of the University of Coimbra (UC), a rich tradition of rituals and festivities organized by UC&#x27;s students, for the students.

===Sports sections===
Many sports teams and athletes of the AAC sports sections have been regularly involved with major national and international sports clubs and competitions. The AAC sports sections, which are the sports departments of AAC, hold many of their training sessions and games in the University Stadium and Sports Complex of the University of Coimbra located in the Santa Clara area of the city, in the southern bank of the Mondego river. There is also the historical &quot;Campo de Santa Cruz&quot; close by the &quot;Pólo I&quot; campus of the University of Coimbra, the oldest campus of this university, which as facilities that include 2 fields for the practice of several sports events including football, rugby and baseball.

The AAC sports sections (sports departments) include:

*Archery
*Athletics
*Badminton
*Baseball since 1994.
*Basketball: is played at &quot;Pavilhão Multiusos de Coimbra&quot;. The team (Associação Académica de Coimbra - basketball) currently plays in the highest level of Portuguese basketball, the Portuguese Basketball Premier League.
*Body building
*Boxing
*Canoeing
*Chess
*Competitive swimming 
*Fencing
*Football: Associação Académica de Coimbra - Secção de Futebol (AAC - SF)
*Gymnastics

*Associação Académica de Coimbra (rugby union): The team has been a major contender in the Portuguese top level rugby union championship. They represented Portugal once at the European Challenge Cup, as an amateur side, for the season of 2004/05, being eliminated by Borders, from Scotland, after heavy losses of 3-98, home, and 3-107, away, in an aggregate of 6-205. Académica didn&#x27;t attend the European Shield the same season. The Coimbra side had one of its players, Rui Cordeiro, in the Portugal national rugby union team which was present at the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

===Autonomous organisations===

Besides the sports clubs and the arts sections of the Associação Académica de Coimbra, there are also independent organisations within the AAC, the &quot;Organismos Autónomos&quot;. Such as the above-mentioned Orfeon Académico de Coimbra (1880), which today represents the city of Coimbra and the university during its world tours.

The same applies to the professional football team of the AAC, the Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F. (not to be confused with the Associação Académica de Coimbra - Secção de Futebol devoted to amateur football), usually known as &quot;Académica&quot; or &quot;Briosa&quot;, which has a legally-binding link to the student association AAC and its university, the University of Coimbra. This team is amongst the top Portuguese football leagues and was created in 1887. It is a professional football club, established by the AAC and also part of the AAC as an independent club. The AAC football club was the first ever winner of the Portuguese Football Cup, in 1939.

Among the autonomous organisations of AAC there are also some well reputed theatre groups with a vast curriculum of acclaimed performances and playing a critical part in the city&#x27;s cultural life.
AAC autonomous organisations include:

*Choral music: OAC - Orfeon Académico de Coimbra and &quot;CMUC - Coro Misto da Universidade de Coimbra&quot;
*Folk music and Ethnography: &quot;Grupo de Etnografia e Folclore da Academia de Coimbra&quot;
*Professional football team: Associação Académica de Coimbra - O.A.F.
*Music: &quot;Tuna Académica da Universidade de Coimbra&quot;
*Plastic arts: &quot;Círculo de Artes Plásticas de Coimbra&quot;
*Theatre: &quot;TEUC - Teatro dos Estudantes da Universidade de Coimbra&quot; and &quot;CITAC - Círculo de Iniciação Teatral da Academia de Coimbra&quot;

==Events==

The AAC is also responsible for the organization of the &quot;Queima das Fitas&quot;, one of the biggest student festivals in Europe and a great event in the city. The &quot;Festa das Latas&quot;, a smaller-scale event is the freshman&#x27;s week of the University of Coimbra, also organised by the AAC. The AAC is the official body of the traditional &quot;Praxe&quot;, a sort of students&#x27; rite of passage, created by students of the University of Coimbra, which has a code of conduct, the &quot;Código da Praxe&quot;), a book published within the students&#x27; union.

==The Symbol==

Before the current logo, the AAC used to be represented by a black cape to reflect the university&#x27;s traditional students&#x27; uniform. The AAC logo was created by Francisco Pimentel in 1927 by request of the AAC&#x27;s &quot;Main board&quot;. The logo of the Associação Académica de Coimbra has a stylized drawing of the tower of the university and the acronym AAC.

The Tower of Coimbra&#x27;s University is the city&#x27;s «ex-libris» with its iconic bell. The tower&#x27;s bell is known amongst the students as the &quot;cabra&quot; (she-goat). The tower is of Baroque style by the school of the German-born architect Ludovice who built it between 1728 and 1733. It is almost 34 metres high, and has a narrow and circular staircase which leads to a belvedere with remarkable views over the university, the historical part of the city centre and the river Mondego.

==AAC uniqueness==
University of Coimbra&#x27;s AAC is the biggest organization of its kind in Europe. It is also the oldest in Portugal.

Other similar students&#x27; unions in the country, such as &quot;(Associação Académica da Universidade de Lisboa)&quot; (University of Lisbon), &quot;Associação Académica da Universidade de Aveiro&quot; (University of Aveiro), &quot;Associação Académica da Universidade da Beira Interior&quot; (University of Beira Interior), &quot;Associação Académica da Universidade do Minho&quot; (Minho University), or &quot;Associação Académica da Universidade do Algarve&quot; (University of the Algarve), are smaller students&#x27; unions by number of associates because its universities have a smaller number of students or because the universities&#x27; student&#x27;s aren&#x27;t automatically members of the union, with a membership fee being required.

In other places in Portugal, there are many independent faculty, college, institute and school organizations of students from many mother-institutions (universities or polytechnical institutes) that are not representative of the whole mother-institution, being this fragmentation the reason for their smaller size, importance, and strength. There are also federations of students&#x27; unions comprising public and private, university and polytechnic independent and not related institutions from a city, like &quot;FAP - Federação Académica do Porto&quot; (from Porto) which is the largest students organization in the country, that do not represent a single university or polytechnic, but many independent federated students&#x27; unions from institutions of the most diverse kind.

<text>James Howe McClure (9 October 1939, Johannesburg, South Africa – 17 June 2006, Oxford, England) was a British author and journalist best known for his Kramer and Zondi mysteries set in South Africa.

==Early life and career==
James McClure was born and raised in South Africa and educated in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, at Scottsville School (1947–51), Cowan House (1952–54), and Maritzburg College (1955–58). He worked first as a commercial photographer with Tom Sharpe, who later wrote a series of celebrated comic novels, and then as a teacher of English and art at Cowan House in 1959–63, before becoming a crime reporter and photographer for the &quot;Natal Witness&quot; in his home town of Pietermaritzburg.

His journalistic career saw him headhunted first by the &quot;Natal Mercury&quot; and then by the &quot;Natal Daily News&quot;. After the birth of his first son, he moved to Britain with his family in 1965, where he joined the Scottish Daily Mail as a sub-editor. From there, he moved to the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; and then to the &quot;Oxford Times&quot;.

==Writing career==
His first crime novel, &quot;The Steam Pig&quot;, won the CWA Gold Dagger in 1971.
He resigned as deputy editor in 1974 to write full-time. He added to his series of police procedurals based on his experiences in South Africa, featuring the detective partnership of Afrikaner Lieutenant Tromp Kramer and Bantu Detective Sergeant Mickey Zondi.

McClure also wrote a spy novel set in Southern Africa – &quot;Rogue Eagle&quot; – which won the 1976 CWA Silver Dagger, a number of short stories, and two large non-fiction works that won wide acclaim: &quot;Spike Island: Portrait of a Police Division&quot; (Liverpool) and &quot;Copworld: Inside an American Police Force&quot; (San Diego).

After publishing 14 books, he returned to the bottom rung of &quot;The Oxford Times&quot; in 1986, as his police books had made him aware of how much he had missed working with others – his intention being to write in his spare time. What proved his most popular Kramer and Zondi novel then followed, &quot;The Song Dog&quot;, but journalism soon became all consuming. He became editor in 1994 and three years later The Oxford Times won the Weekly Newspaper of the Year award, beating all comers from across the United Kingdom.

He was promoted to editor of the Oxford Mail in 2000, and spent the next three years on a variety of objectives to enhance the quality and revenue of the county&#x27;s daily paper. That done, he decided it was time to again step down, and retired to return to writing. He was working on a novel set in Oxford and had just started his own blog when he came down with a respiratory illness and died on 17 June 2006. He lived in Wallingford, Oxfordshire.

<text>L.L.Bean is an American privately held retail company that was founded in 1912 by Leon Leonwood Bean. The company, headquartered in Freeport, Maine (where it was founded), specializes in clothing and outdoor recreation equipment.

==History==
L.L.Bean was founded in 1912 by its namesake, hunter and fisherman Leon Leonwood Bean, in Freeport, Maine. The company began as a one-room operation selling a single product, the Maine Hunting Shoe, also known as duck boots and later as Bean Boots. Bean had developed a waterproof boot, which is a combination of lightweight leather uppers and rubber bottoms that he sold to hunters. He obtained a list of nonresident Maine hunting license holders, prepared a descriptive mail order circular, set up a shop in his brother&#x27;s basement in Freeport and started a nationwide mail-order business. The company&#x27;s first hunting boot was sewn by Gertrude Goldrup, whose sewing machine is on display in the flagship store.

By 1912, Bean was selling the Bean Boot through a four-page mail-order catalog, and the boot remains a staple of the company&#x27;s outdoor image. Defects in the initial design led to 90 percent of the original production run being returned: Bean honored his money-back guarantee, corrected the design, and continued selling them.

According to Bean, relating the incorporation of the company, &quot;officers elected Nov. 16, 1934...L.L. Bean, President and Treasurer; Carl Bean Vice President and Assistant Treasurer; Jack Gorman, my son-in-law, Vice President and Clothing Buyer; and Warren Bean, my son, Clerk.&quot; Gross sales for his company amounted to $1 million in 1946, increasing to $3.8 million in 1966, $20.4 million in 1974, and $237.4 million in 1984.

The L.L.Bean retail store campus in Freeport, Maine, is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

As of February 26, 2024, L.L.Bean is discontinuing mail orders, shifting business entirely to online and telephone orders.

== Leadership ==
After Leon L. Bean&#x27;s death in 1967, the company passed into the directorship of Bean&#x27;s grandson, Leon Gorman, from that time until 2001, when Gorman decided to take the position of chairman. Christopher McCormick assumed the role of CEO, the first non-family member to assume the title. On May 19, 2013, Shawn Gorman, 47, a great-grandson of the company&#x27;s founder, was elected L.L.Bean&#x27;s chairman. The company announced a US$125,000 donation to a new scholarship fund upon Leon Gorman&#x27;s death in 2015, representing about 2.5 years of tuition at Bowdoin College, Gorman&#x27;s alma mater.

Stephen Smith was named chief executive officer (CEO) in November 2015, the first time in the company&#x27;s 103-year history that a CEO had been hired from outside the company.

==Product line==
The company sells a variety of hiking, weather, and other utility boots, along with other outdoor equipment such as firearms, backpacks, and tents, in addition to producing a full line of clothing.

L.L.Bean sources its products from the US and across the globe. As of 2016, its factory in Brunswick, Maine, employed more than 450 people who made the company&#x27;s products by hand, such as the Maine Hunting Shoe, L.L.Bean Boot, Boat and Totes, dog beds, leather goods, and backpacks.

In 2000, L.L.Bean partnered with Japanese automaker Subaru, making L.L.Bean the official outfitter of Subaru, spawning the L.L.Bean edition Subaru Outback and Subaru Forester for the US market. The L.L.Bean trim levels were top-spec versions, with most available options included as standard equipment. This relationship with Subaru ended June 28, 2008.

In 2010, L.L.Bean created a contemporary sub-brand called L.L.Bean Signature. The Signature line is a modern interpretation of L.L.Bean&#x27;s previous products with modern fits.

==Retail stores==


Along with a number of retail and outlet stores, the company maintains its flagship store on Main Street in Freeport. This branch, originally opened in 1917, remained open continuously, 24 hours a day, between 1951 and 1962, when Maine changed its blue laws; a town vote later reinstated the store&#x27;s open-door policy. The flagship has closed to honor the death of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963, and the deaths of founder Leon L. Bean in 1967 and his grandson Leon Gorman in 2015. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, all L.L.Bean stores were closed indefinitely starting on March 17, 2020, at midnight. It was the first time it had ever closed for more than 24 hours. The company began to reopen stores in May 2020.

L.L.Bean has invested heavily in activities for both visitors and residents in Freeport, including its Outdoor Discovery Schools, Christmas light displays, and its Summer Concert Series, which has attracted artists such as Grace Potter, Lake Street Dive, Edwin McCain, Great Big Sea, Buckwheat Zydeco, and Rockapella.

L.L.Bean opened its first outlet store in North Conway, New Hampshire, in 1988. As of 2024, the company has 60 locations in 19 U.S. states, plus 22 stores in Japan and 13 stores in Canada. The brand is also distributed in about 200 partner stores, such as Nordstrom.

In March 2018, L.L.Bean opened its first urban location in Boston&#x27;s Seaport District. The store will be the model for further expansion in urban areas and carry a selection of merchandise selected to fit the surrounding community.

In November 2019, it was announced that L.L.Bean would be launching in the UK.

===Returns policy===
From its founding, L.L.Bean had an unlimited return policy, which allowed customers to return items with which they were dissatisfied at any time, even without a purchase receipt. On February 9, 2018, the company announced it would be limiting returns to within one year of purchase, and only with a receipt or other proof of purchase. L.L.Bean said that some customers had been abusing the policy by returning items that had been purchased from yard sales and third parties or used the policy as a lifetime replacement program for items with normal wear and tear. L.L.Bean has also stated it reserves the right to deny returns to those who regularly return items.

===International expansion===
L.L. Bean has ventured into international markets notably Japan and Canada, starting with Japan in 1976 with L.L. Bean bags debuting at American Life Shop BEAMS in Tokyo&#x27;s Harajuku district in 1976. It opened its first outlet in Japan in November 1992, and then expanding to 28 stores in the country by November 2018. The company then ventured into the Canadian market, launching an e-commerce site in 2018 under licensing by Toronto-based Jaytex Group and expansion directed under Brokerage Oberfeld Snowcap, and opening its first outlet in 2019 in Oakville, Ontario, with at least eight stores opened by the end of 2021 with plans to establish at least 20 more.

In 2020, the company expanded its outlets in Ontario, including one at Ottawa&#x27;s Train Yards, one at the Georgian Mall in Barrie, and one at Vaughan Mills.

In 2021, the company opened outlets at Toronto&#x27;s Shops at Don Mills, one at Halifax, Nova Scotia&#x27;s Dartmouth Crossing, one at Calgary, Alberta&#x27;s Deerfoot Meadows retail centre with two in British Columbia; one in Victoria&#x27;s Mayfair Mall and one at Burnaby&#x27;s The Amazing Brentwood. In 2022, there were five more Ontario openings; with one at Kitchener&#x27;s The Boardwalk, Kingston&#x27;s Cataraqui Mall, and one at Moncton, New Brunswick&#x27;s Champlain Place, Niagara Falls&#x27; Canada One and Edmonton, Alberta&#x27;s West Edmonton Mall.

==Political controversy==
In January 2017, a group of political activists called for a boycott against the company after it was disclosed that Linda Bean, one of the descendants of founder Leon Leonwood Bean who sits on the board of directors, had donated US$60,000 to a political action committee that supported Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign. There were assertions that the contribution may be illegal. Trump posted on Twitter, in support of Linda Bean after calls for the boycott, &quot;Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean.&quot; The company said it had not donated to Trump, nor have any of the other directors or any of the 50 other Bean heirs. It was unclear if the publicity hurt business, since sales were flat prior and for a second consecutive year in 2016.

==Outdoor Discovery Schools==
L.L.Bean has education programs connected to many of its retail outlets to support the outdoor interests of its customers. Customers can sign up to participate in a number of outdoor activities; all equipment and instruction are provided. Activities include archery, clay shooting, fly casting, and sea kayaking. More advanced classes are conducted as well, and must be reserved in advance. Snowshoeing and cross country skiing are available December to March. All other retail stores offer fly casting and kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding.

==In popular culture==

<text>Hans (Johannes Emil) Dülfer was a German mountain climber (23 May 1892 in Barmen / Wuppertal – 15 June 1915 in Arras).

Dülfer started studying medicine from 1911 in Munich, and then changed to law and later to philosophy. The proximity of the Alps enticed him to make 50 first ascents, particularly the Kaisergebirge (in the Northern Limestone Alps) and in the Rosengarten in the Dolomites.

* 1911 Dülfer-Kamin am Totenkirchl (literal English: Duelfer chimney at the dead church)
* 1912 Fleischbank-Ostwand (literal English: meat-bank east wall)
* 1913 Dülfer-Riss der Fleischbank (literal English: Duelfer crack of the meat bank)

Dülfer developed several early climbing techniques, such as the Dülfersitz rappel, a basic emergency abseil skill.

He died in World War I, on the battlefield at Arras.

<doc id="861713" wikidata="Q1193977" url="?curid=861713" title="Sun Language Theory">
<text>The Sun Language Theory () was a Turkish pseudolinguistic, pseudoscientific quasi-hypothesis developed in Turkey in the 1930s that proposed that all human languages are descendants of one proto-Turkic primal language. The theory&#x27;s promotion of Turks as a progenitor race led to it finding favour among Turkish ultranationalists, who used it to justify their nationalist ideology.

It claims that primal language had close phonemic resemblances to Turkish and, because of this, all other languages can be traced back to Turkic roots. According to the theory, this primal language originated among Central Asian worshippers who created it as a means to salute the omnipotence of the sun and its life-giving qualities, hence the name.

==Origins==
Influences on the theory included:

* the ideas of the French historian Hilaire de Barenton, expressed in &quot;L&#x27;Origine des Langues, des Religions et des Peuples&quot; (&quot;The Origin of Languages, Religions and Peoples&quot;), that all languages originated from hieroglyphs and cuneiform used by Sumerians. Turkish linguists claimed a Turkish origin for the Sumerians, and therefore the origin of language was Turkish. 

* a paper of the Austrian linguist Hermann F. Kvergić of Vienna entitled &quot;La psychologie de quelques éléments des langues Turques&quot; (&quot;The Psychology of Some Elements of the Turkic Languages&quot;). He also conducted some research on the theory with support of the Turkish Embassy in Vienna.
During ten months in late 1935 and early 1936 Turkish linguists from the Turkish Language Society developed the Sun Language Theory which was presented as the source of all languages in the Third Turkish Language Congress.

== History ==
The theory counted on the approval of the first president of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who not only gave the theory official backing and material support but was also an important contributor to its development. It received the formal support of the Turkish Government during the Third Turkish Language Congress in 1936. During the same congress the vast majority of the international non-Turkish scholars including opposed the theory. One of the few non-Turkish linguists who supported the theory was Kvergić. 

=== Influence in Turkey ===
Since the theory claimed that all words had originated from Turkish, it was not deemed necessary anymore to replace all foreign loanwords in the language, a process that had been initiated before. Initially the theory was taught only in the Turkology departments of the Turkish Universities, but on the order of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, it was to be taught in all departments as a mandatory assignment. The Sun Language Theory lost its prominent role shortly after the death of Mustafa Kemal in November 1938 and was not even mentioned in the next Turkish Language Congress in 1942.

In the 1990s, definitions and comments were made by some authors about the founding principles of the Republic of Turkey, its actions in its first years, and Atatürk&#x27;s Principles, such as the official state ideology and the denial of ethnicity, by citing the Sun Language Theory studies. For this purpose, it was written that irrational rumors were fabricated about the Sun Language Theory and the Turkish History Thesis supported by Atatürk and that Atatürk was wanted to be shown as &quot;a person who believes in nonsense&quot;. It is argued that these are purposeful publications made under the influence of the postmodernist wave, with the aim of criticizing the Atatürk Revolutions and their effects.

==Tenets==
As described in a 1936 &quot;New York Times&quot; article on the curriculum of the newly opened School of Language, History, and Geography of Ankara University, the theoryclaims that [insofar as] the Sumerians, being Turks, originat[ed] in Central Asia, all languages also consequently originated there and [were] first used by the Turks. The first language, in fact, came into being in this way: Prehistoric man, i.e., Turks in the most primitive stage, was so struck by the effects of the sun on life that he made of it a deity whence sprang all good and evil. Thence came to him light, darkness, warmth, and fire, with it were associated all ideas of time: height, distance, movement, size, and give expression to his feelings. The sun was thus the first thing to which a name was given. It was &quot;ag&quot; (pronounced agh), and from this syllable all words in use today are derived. This, briefly, is the theory about the &quot;sun language,&quot; and with the new conception of Turkish history it will be taught in the new Angora school.Based upon a heliocentric view of the origin of civilization and human languages, the theory claimed that the Turkish language was the language which all civilized languages derived from. According to the theory, the first people to speak were the superior race of the Alpine Brachycephalic Turks, which spread throughout the earth in the aftermath of a climate catastrophe, therefore providing the people in all civilizations with the benefits of the language. 

Some of the words provided with false Turkish etymologies through the practice of &quot;goropism&quot; were &quot;God&quot;, attributed to the Turkish &quot;kut&quot;; &quot;Bulletin&quot; from Turkish &quot;bülten,&quot; &quot;belleten&quot;; or &quot;Electric&quot; from Uyghur &quot;yaltrık&quot; (shine). But also foreign words like the French wattman, in French stemming from watt and man, were claimed to be of Turkish origin by a Turkish scholar. Other prominent examples are Greek mythological figures like Aphrodite from , or Artemis from . According to linguist Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, &quot;it is possible that the Sun Language Theory was adopted by Atatürk in order to legitimize the Arabic and Persian words which the Turkish language authorities did not manage to uproot. This move compensated for the failure to provide a neologism for every foreignism/loanword.&quot;

<doc id="861715" wikidata="Q346808" url="?curid=861715" title="Gerard ter Borch">
<text>Gerard ter Borch (; December 1617 – 8 December 1681), also known as Gerard Terburg (), was a Dutch Golden Age painter mainly of genre subjects. He influenced his fellow Dutch painters Gabriel Metsu, Gerrit Dou, Eglon van der Neer and Johannes Vermeer. According to Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., Ter Borch &quot;established a new framework for subject matter, taking people into the sanctum of the home&quot;, showing the figures&#x27; uncertainties and expertly hinting at their inner lives. His influence as a painter, however, was later surpassed by Vermeer.

==Biography==
Gerard ter Borch was born in December 1617 in Zwolle in the province of Overijssel in the Dutch Republic.

He received an excellent education from his father Gerard ter Borch the Elder, also an artist, and developed his talent very early. The inscription on a study of a head proves that Ter Borch was at Amsterdam in 1632, where he studied possibly under Willem Cornelisz Duyster or Pieter Codde. Duyster&#x27;s influence can be traced in a picture bearing the date 1638, in the Ionides Bequest (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). In 1634 he studied under Pieter de Molijn in Haarlem. A record of this Haarlem period is the &quot;Consultation&quot; (1635) at the Berlin Gallery.

In 1635, he was in London, and subsequently he travelled in Germany, France, Spain and Italy. His sister Gesina also became a painter. It is certain that he was in Rome in 1641, when he painted the small portraits on copper of &quot;Jan Six&quot;, &quot;A Young Lady&quot; (Six Collection, Amsterdam) and the portrait of a Gentlemen (DMK Collection Nuermberg). In 1648 he was at Münster during the meeting of the congress which ratified the treaty of peace between the Spaniards and the Dutch, and executed his celebrated little picture, painted upon copper, of the assembled plenipotentiaries—a work which, along with a portrait of a &quot;Man Standing&quot; (&quot;Portrait of a Young Man&quot;), represents the master in the National Gallery in London. The picture was bought by the marquess of Hertford at the Demidoff sale for £7280, and presented to the National Gallery by Sir Richard Wallace, at the suggestion of his secretary, Sir John Murray Scott.

At this time Ter Borch was invited to visit Madrid, where he received employment and the honour of knighthood from Philip IV, but, in consequence of an intrigue, it is said, he was obliged to return to the Netherlands. One of his great patrons was Amsterdam burgomaster and statesman Andries de Graeff. He seems to have resided for a time in Haarlem; but he finally settled in Deventer, where he became a member of the town council, as which he appears in the portrait now in the gallery of the Hague. He died at Deventer in 1681.

==Works==
Ter Borch is a significant painter of genre subjects. He is known for his rendering of texture in draperies, for example in &quot;The Letter&quot; and in &quot;The Gallant Conversation&quot;, engraved by Johann Georg Wille.

Ter Borch&#x27;s works are comparatively rare; about eighty have been catalogued. Six of these are at the Hermitage, six at the Berlin Museum, five at the Louvre, four at the Dresden Museum, three at the Getty Center, and two at the Wallace Collection.
A pair of portraits were located at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C., highlighted in 2010 by Blake Gopnik.

The artist&#x27;s painting &quot;The Suitor&#x27;s Visit&quot;, c. 1658, oil on canvas, 80 x 75 cm (31½ × 29 9/16 in.) in the Andrew W. Mellon Collection, was used on the cover of Marilyn Stokstad&#x27;s second edition of &quot;Art History&quot;.

===Selected works===
==Claim for Nazi-looted art==
In 2007, the heirs to the retail magnate Max Emden requested that the National Gallery of Victoria restitute the Gerard ter Borch painting &quot;Lady with a Fan&quot; which Emden had owned prior to the rise of the Nazis.

<doc id="861717" wikidata="Q7444568" url="?curid=861717" title="Section (United States land surveying)">
<text>In U.S. land surveying under the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), a section is an area nominally , containing , with 36 sections making up one survey township on a rectangular grid.

The legal description of a tract of land under the PLSS includes the name of the state, name of the county, township number, range number, section number, and portion of a section. Sections are customarily surveyed into smaller squares by repeated halving and quartering. A quarter section is and a &quot;quarter-quarter section&quot; is . In 1832 the smallest area of land that could be acquired was reduced to the quarter-quarter section, and this size parcel became entrenched in American mythology. After the Civil War, freedmen (freed slaves) were reckoned to be self-sufficient with &quot;40 acres and a mule.&quot; In the 20th century real estate developers preferred working with parcels. The phrases &quot;front 40&quot; and &quot;,&quot; referring to farm fields, indicate the front and back quarter-quarter sections of land.

One of the reasons for creating sections of was the ease of dividing into halves and quarters while still maintaining a whole number of acres. A section can be halved seven times in this way, down to a parcel, or half of a quarter-quarter-quarter section—an easily surveyed 50-square-chain (2 ha) area. This system was of great practical value on the American frontier, where surveyors often had a shaky grasp of mathematics and were required to work quickly.

A description of a quarter-quarter section in standard abbreviated form, might look like &quot;NW 1/4, NE 1/4, Sec. 34, T.3S, R.1W, 1st P.M.&quot; or, alternatively, &quot;34-3-1 NW4NE4 1PM&quot;. In expanded form, this would read:The Northwest quarter of the Northeast quarter of Section 34 of Township 3 South, Range 1 West, first Principal Meridian.

==History==
The existence of section lines made property descriptions far more straightforward than the old metes and bounds system. The establishment of standard east-west and north-south lines (&quot;township&quot; and &quot;range lines&quot;) meant that deeds could be written without regard to temporary terrain features such as trees, piles of rocks, fences, and the like, and be worded in the style such as &quot;Lying and being in Township 4 North; Range 7 West; and being the northwest quadrant of the southwest quadrant of said section,&quot; an exact description in this case of 40 acres, as there are in a square mile.

The importance of &quot;sections&quot; was greatly enhanced by the passage of &quot;An Ordinance for ascertaining the mode of disposing of lands in the Western Territory&quot; of 1785 by the U.S. Congress (see Land Ordinance of 1785). This law provided that lands outside the then-existing states could not be sold, otherwise distributed, or opened for settlement prior to being surveyed. The standard way of doing this was to divide the land into sections. An area of six sections by six sections would define a township. Within this area, one section (section 16) was designated as school land. As the entire parcel would not be necessary for the school and its grounds, the balance of it was to be sold, with the monies to go into the construction and upkeep of the school. Section 36 was also subsequently added as a school section in western states. The ordinance also specified that &quot;out of every township, the four lots, being numbered 8, 11, 26, 29, and out of every fractional part of a township, so many lots of the same numbers as shall be found thereon, for future sale&quot;.

On May 20, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the Homestead Act, by which settlers could &quot;claim&quot; 160 acres (a quarter section) of public land. Claimants were required to &quot;live on&quot; and “improve” their plots by cultivating the land. After five years, the original filer of the claim was entitled to the property, free and clear, except for a small registration fee.

Sections can be divided into quarter sections of , named by intercardinal direction (northwest, northeast, etc.). For instance, the southwest quarter of a section is named SW 1/4.
Sections can be further broken up into blocks, or quarter-quarter sections. These add a second intercardinal direction label. For instance, the southeast quarter of the southwest quarter section mentioned above is labeled SE 1/4, SW 1/4:

==Measurement anomalies==
The curvature of the Earth makes it impossible to superimpose a regular grid on its surface, as the meridians converge toward the North Pole. As the U.S. is in the Northern Hemisphere, if a section&#x27;s or township&#x27;s east and west sides lie along meridians, its north side is shorter than its south side. As sections were surveyed from south and east to north and west, accumulated errors and distortions resulted in the north and west lines, and north and west sections diverged the most from the ideal shape and size.

The entire township grid shifts to account for the Earth&#x27;s curvature. Where the grid is corrected, or where two grids based on different principal meridians meet, section shapes are irregular.

Sections also differ from the PLSS ideal of one square mile for other reasons, including errors and sloppy work by surveyors, poor instrumentation, and difficult terrain. In addition, the primary survey tool was the magnetic compass, which is influenced by local irregularities.

Once established, even an imperfect grid remains in force, mainly because the monuments of the original survey, when recovered, hold legal precedent over subsequent resurveys.

==Alternatives and legacy systems==
The Public Land Survey System was not the first to define and implement a survey grid. A number of similar systems were established, often using terms like section and township but not necessarily in the same way. For example, the lands of the Holland Purchase in western New York were surveyed into a township grid before the PLSS was established. In colonial New England land was often divided into squares called towns or townships and further subdivided into parcels called lots or sections.

Sections are also used in land descriptions in the portion of northwestern Georgia that was formerly part of the territory of the Cherokee Nation. They are not, however, part of the PLSS and are irregular in shape and size. See Cherokee County, Georgia for more information on the historical reasons for this.

Another exception to the usual use of sections and section numbering occurs when most of a parcel, or lot, falls under a body of water. The term &quot;government lot&quot; is used for such parcels and they are usually described separately from the rest of the section using single numbers (such as &quot;Government Lot 5 of Section 15&quot;). Also, parcels within a platted subdivision are often specified by lot number rather than using PLSS descriptions.

Where Spanish land grants in Florida have descriptions that predate PLSS or even the U.S. itself, deviation from typical section numbering and size and shape often takes place. In an effort to honor these land grants after the U.S. took control of Florida, surveyors would use descriptions from confirmed land grants to establish their initial boundaries and created PLSS sections that extrapolated from those lines. Often, the amount of land left over in areas immediately surrounding the grants was grossly undersized or awkwardly shaped. Those tracts are referred to as &quot;fractional sections&quot; and often are not subject to township or range definitions. An example of such a legal description&#x27;s beginning would read &quot;Being a portion of Fractional Sec. 59, Township 0 South, Range 0 West&quot;.

Also, land north of the Watson Line near the Georgia border was not subject to the standard U.S. section, township and range designations, since the State of Georgia had claimed and laid out counties and surveyed its public lands south of that line into what eventually became part of the State of Florida. The exact location of the Georgia–Florida state line was ultimately confirmed by an Act of Congress, approved April 9, 1872.

<doc id="861726" wikidata="Q7925945" url="?curid=861726" title="Victor Grayson">
<text>Albert Victor Grayson (born 5 September 1881, disappeared 28 September 1920) was an English socialist politician of the early 20th century. An Independent Labour Party Member of Parliament from 1907 to 1910, Grayson is most notable for his sensational by-election victory at Colne Valley, and unexplained disappearance in 1920.

==Early years==
Albert Victor Grayson was born in Liverpool, the seventh son of William Grayson, a Yorkshire carpenter, and Elizabeth Craig, who was Scottish. He became an apprentice engineer in Bootle. Grayson joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and toured the country giving lectures, becoming a well-known orator despite having a stammer. In 1907 he stood as an ILP candidate in the 1907 Colne Valley by-election, having been nominated by the Colne Valley Labour League; he won a sensational, albeit narrow, victory. Grayson was paid an allowance by the ILP but refused to sign the Labour Party constitution.

Grayson was subject to an assessment by Winston Churchill in 1908: &quot;The Socialism of the Christian era was based on the idea that, &#x27;All mine is yours,&#x27; but the Socialism of Mr Grayson is based on the idea that &#x27;All yours is mine. Writing of Grayson in 1913 in an article on British radical politics in &quot;Pravda&quot;, Vladimir Lenin noted that Grayson was &quot;a very fiery socialist, but one not strong in principles and given to phrase-mongering.&quot;

Grayson rarely attended the House of Commons and began to develop a drinking problem. After losing his seat in the January 1910 general election, and failing even to retain his deposit when standing for Kennington in December 1910, he continued his lecture tours but suffered a mental breakdown in 1913 and in August 1914 was declared bankrupt with debts of £496. Grayson later alienated many of his left-wing colleagues by backing Britain&#x27;s entry into World War I and turning his oratorical skills to recruiting soldiers. He enlisted in 1916 and served briefly in the New Zealand Army and was wounded the following year on the Western Front. After the war, Grayson attempted to resurrect his political career.

==Personal life==
In his early life, Grayson conducted a longterm affair with Harry Dawson, a fellow Merseyside socialist. In one of a collection of love letters written to Dawson, he wrote: &quot;I love you as ever, with the same devouring passion and intensity and thickness.&quot;

In 1912, Grayson married Ruth Nightingale, a young actress with boyish looks, with whom he had a daughter. The marriage was unhappy and Ruth died in childbirth in the 1918 influenza epidemic.

==Honours scandal==
In 1918, Sir Basil Thomson, head of the Special Branch, asked Maundy Gregory to spy on Grayson, suspecting him of working as an agent for the new communist government in Russia or for the Irish Republican Army. Grayson discovered that Gregory was spying on him and, with the help of some important friends, found out that Prime Minister David Lloyd George was using Gregory to sell political honours. 

At a public meeting in Liverpool, Grayson accused Lloyd George of selling honours for between £10,000 and £40,000. He declared: &quot;This sale of honours is a national scandal. It can be traced right down to 10 Downing Street, and to a monocled dandy with offices in Whitehall. I know this man, and one day I will name him.&quot; Grayson&#x27;s &quot;monocled dandy&quot; remark let Gregory know that he was in danger of being exposed. Grayson also suspected Gregory of having forged Roger Casement&#x27;s diaries, which were used as evidence to convict and execute him for treason, (although it later turned out that Casement had engaged in the homosexual activities described). 

At the beginning of September 1920, Grayson was beaten up in the Strand. This was probably an attempt to frighten him, but he continued threatening to name the man behind the corrupt system.

==Disappearance==
By 1920, Grayson was living in an expensive suite of rooms in Piccadilly, although he earned only a modest income from occasional pieces of journalism. Biographer David Clark believes that, having alienated both the socialists and the trade unions, Grayson had entered into blackmail in order to fund his lavish lifestyle.

On 28 September 1920, Grayson was out drinking with friends when he received a telephone message. He told his friends that he had to go to the Queen&#x27;s Hotel in Leicester Square and would be back shortly. He did not return.

Journalist Donald McCormick claims that artist George Flemwell had been painting a picture of the Thames when he saw Grayson passing him in an electric canoe, along with Maundy Gregory. 
Flemwell further observed the two men entering a house (Number 6, The Island, Thames Ditton) on the river bank on 28 September 1920. Flemwell knew Grayson, having painted his portrait before the war, but did not realise the significance at the time because Grayson was not reported missing until several months later. An investigation carried out in the 1960s revealed that the house that Grayson entered was owned by Gregory. Research by Andrew Cook suggests that McCormick may have fabricated the story.
It has been speculated that Grayson was murdered to prevent his revealing evidence of corruption. A comprehensive biography by David G. Clark suggests he possibly survived into the 1950s under a pseudonym. Clark believes Grayson was bribed in order to keep quiet about the honours scandal, and was told to forge a new identity.

<text>Telkom SA SOC Limited is a South African wireline and wireless telecommunications provider, operating in more than 38 countries across the African continent. Telkom is majority state-owned (55.3%) with the South African government owning 40.5% of Telkom, while another 14.8% is owned by another state-owned company - the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which is closely linked to the South African government.

==History of telecommunications in South Africa==

The first use of telecommunication in South Africa happened in April 1860 was a single line telegraph connecting Cape Town and Simonstown. In 1879, the first undersea links were introduced, first connecting Durban and Europe. In the 1960s, South Africa was connected to 72 nations and total outgoing annual international calls numbered over 28,800.

In 1994, South Africa launched its mobile operations, underwritten by Telkom in partnership with Vodafone. This subsidiary grew to be Vodacom, which Telkom sold in late 2008 in preference for its own 3G network (established as 8ta, but now Telkom Mobile). Vodacom has a subscriber base of more than 45M, with an average revenue per user of more than R60 across both rural and urban subscribers. Vodacom, together with the other operators, have come under criticism in late 2009 by government and the public for high interconnect charges.

In 2005, the Department of Communications redefined the Electronics Communications Act, which consolidated and redefined the landscape of telecommunications licensing in South Africa (both mobile and fixed). The Independent Communications Authority (ICASA) currently licenses more than 400 independent operators with the Electronic Communications Network License (with the ability to self-provision) as well as issuing Electronic Communications Service Licenses for service deployment over infrastructure in the retail domain.

Nowadays, Telkom faces competition from the second Fixed Network Operator Licensee, Neotel, as well as the three mobile operators, Vodacom, MTN, and Cell-C.

==Telkom group structure==
Telkom SA is structured under Group CEO. The retail division, including Telkom Business, Telkom Mobile, Consumer Marketing, Cloud, IT Operations, and its Wholesale and Networks division (Openserve).

Cybernest focuses on Telkom&#x27;s newly deployed DCO infrastructure in Cape Town, Pretoria, and Johannesburg, as well as services thereupon, including data hosting, LAN and application management, and managing IT infrastructure for corporate and large business customers.

Openserve is a licensed infrastructure service provider, installing FTTH infrastructure throughout South Africa and providing products and services to internet service providers. In 2021, Openserve joined the Internet Service Providers&#x27; Association of South Africa.

Telkom acquired Business Connexion in August 2015 for approximately ZAR 2.6 billion with the strategic intent of obtaining a significant presence in the Information Technology (IT) market in South Africa. This was the second attempt at the acquisition by Telkom and was subject to a number of prescribed conditions set out by the competition authorities i.e. one of which was to ensure minimal impact on staff retrenchments. The integration of the two organisations enabled a new and compelling value proposition to be offered to private and public business customers in the domestic market.

Jeffrey Hedberg was appointed acting group chief executive officer on 7 July 2010 following Reuben September&#x27;s resignation. Jeffrey was the CEO of Cell C from 2006 to 2009. However, on 13 January 2011, TechCentral reported that Hedberg would quit Telkom by the end of March 2011, citing that he felt that he would not be given the mandate he needed to fix Telkom commercially and operationally

In 2013, allegations of corruption in terms of poor procurement practice, nepotism and mismanagement were unveiled.

==Telkom market position and ownership==
Telkom was managed by US-based SBC Communications (now AT&amp;T Inc.) from 1997 to 2004. SBC has since sold its interest in the company, after reducing operational expenditure (reducing staff resources, etc.) and increasing revenue by increased product prices, thereby increasing the share-price for greater ROI.

The company is currently the market leader in the broadband space, with more than 500,000 customers on 2-40 Mbit/s DSL; it dominates the managed services market and has more than 250 corporate customers on its order book. Telkom SA operates 4.5M fixed access lines, bases on its 2008 annual report.

==Products and services==

===Telkom ADSL===
Telkom provides ADSL retail services via their ISP Telkom Internet to consumer and business customers, and through Telkom Wholesale to other licensed operators. Most ISPs in South Africa, such as Afrihost, utilise Telkom&#x27;s copper infrastructure for reselling ADSL services.

Telkom provides ADSL with POTS. According to Telkom&#x27;s figures, 92% of exchanges have been upgraded to support ADSL. Telkom is currently the largest provider of fixed-line broadband in the country, with 412 190 subscribers according to the 2008 annual report.

Telkom ADSL is billed as an add-on service to a POTS voice line. A PPPoE account, which can be provided by most Internet Service Providers (ISPs), must be purchased separately to the ADSL connection for internet access. ISPs are divided into two categories, those who purchase IPConnect from Telkom and those who resell PPPoE accounts from IPConnect ISPs or Telkom themselves. IPConnect is a Telkom bit-stream access product allowing ISPs to route internet bandwidth from their ADSL subscribers over their own bandwidth.

Originally, three connection rate ranges are offered (associated with different connection fees) which are &quot;Fast&quot; (1024/384 kbit/s), &quot;Faster&quot; (up to 2048/512 kbit/s), &quot;Fastest&quot; up to 10240/1002 kbit/s (ADSL2+)) of bandwidth for downstream/upstream respectively existed. The actual speed obtained can vary depending on line conditions. These connection rate ranges have since changed, with the minimum speed currently being 2048/512 kbit/s and mid-range 5120/512 kbit/s.

Telkom have released a 10 Mbit ADSL 2+ service for a limited amount of &quot;Fastest&quot; users on 15 August 2010.

From 18 October 2011, Telkom Internet launched business offerings, and has subsequently increased value with speed upgrades and improved prioritisation for business users, as well as converting products to include soft-capping (unlimited browsing).

Telkom Internet offers business and residential SoftCap packages (as of 1 February 2012).

As of 24 August 2012, &quot;Faster&quot; (1024 kbit/s) users started reporting speed upgrades to 2 Mbit/s (2048 kbit/s) on their ADSL Lines. As of 2 September 2012, Telkom have begun the process of trialing 40 Mbit/s VDSL and FTTx.

===Telkom 3G===

Telkom had offered 3G products available since 2008. The coverage was initially limited to a small part of the country. Telkom entered the South African Cellular market under the brand 8ta. The public launch of the network took place on 14 October 2010 and products have been available since 18 October 2010, supporting both GSM and 3G services.

===Telkom Music===

Telkom partnered with Tencent Africa to launch the Telkom Music, a music streaming service that is made available via the Telkom Music Powered By JOOX app in South Africa on 22 July 2021. The Telkom Music Powered by JOOX app was reviewed by Arthur Goldstuck, founder of World Wide Worx.

==Local subsidiaries==
Telkom Group Limited includes South African subsidiaries, BCX, Gyro and Openserve.

The FastNet subsidiary was incorporated into BCX in 2018 with all enterprise wireless solutions, including microwave, satellite, 4G/5G and Wi-Fi solutions.

==Competition==
Recent legislation passed by the South African government have lowered many restrictions on companies wishing to provide telecommunication access in the Republic. Competitors to the land-line monopoly have flourished, with special note given to providers of wireless broadband, who provide greater geographical penetration, by means of the technology used, than Telkom. Examples of these providers include Sentech, an extension of the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation, and WBS Co., a black owned enterprise. On 31 August 2006, Neotel (Second Network Operator) announced the launch of its services as the second national operator, initially offering wholesale international services, with plans to expand to business &amp; residential customers within months. Neotel plans to initially use CDMA-2000 wireless technology for the last mile infrastructure due to the government and ICASA&#x27;s (the regulator) inability and unwillingness to unbundle the local-loop, leading some to suggest that it&#x27;s not much more than a cellular operator instead of the much needed competitor to Telkom.

The three mobile telephone networks in South Africa, listed in terms of numbers of subscribers, are Vodacom (currently 65% owned by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Vodafone, but until November 2008 jointly with Telkom SA), MTN and Cell C. There are several service providers, such as Virgin Mobile and Nashua Mobile, which subscribers can use to access the networks. There are approximately six times as many cellphone subscribers than land line subscribers in South Africa (30 million versus 5 million), and since these networks route their calls over their own network, GSM providers have taken a large chunk of Telkom&#x27;s business, one reason for this is that many see Telkom as being an inept corporation, only interested in making money, failing to consider the customer. This is a fine example of a monopoly that would, in true free market environments, soon fail.

Another promising technology is Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which may decrease the number of calls made over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) in the near future. Telkom&#x27;s international calling rates are already far undercut by VoIP providers.

==Pan African operations==

Telkom operates in 38 countries in Africa, from regional hubs in Nigeria and Kenya via an integrated service provider strategy
. It is expanding its service portfolio across managed voice, managed data, IT services &amp; applications, and diversifying into new revenue growth opportunities in adjacent markets.

Recent acquisitions of Kenyan ISP Africa Online, and Nigerian mobile operator Multi-Links gives Telkom strategic hubs to expand data and voice services into Africa. Africa Online (AFOL) is a Pan African Internet Service Provider operating in eight countries with the 9th country through a joint-venture with Verizon South Africa. Multi-Links is a private telecommunications operator (as of 2009 a wholly owned Telkom subsidiary) with a Unified Access License allowing fixed, mobile, data, long-distance and international telecommunications services focused primarily on corporate clients in Nigeria.

Via Africa Online, Telkom intends leveraging its international capacity to deploy satellite based Internet access. Through Multi-Links, Telkom is introducing converged fixed and mobile services to the Nigerian market.

==Criticisms==

===Monopoly and state ownership===
High cost of Internet access is a major point of consumer frustration in South Africa. Telkom&#x27;s monopoly, backed by government investment, over fixed line provision and international access is often pointed out as the primary reason for the high costs of telecommunications.

The continuing monopoly of Telkom in South Africa&#x27;s communications industry, and government&#x27;s large stake in the company, have been perceived by the public, consumers, and the private sector as not being in the public&#x27;s best interests. The South African telecommunications regulator ICASA is overburdened and restricted in its capabilities as handed down by the Department of Communications. Telkom has a monopoly of all international calls originating within South Africa excluding VoIP, and of traffic over the SAT3 cable that provides most of South Africa&#x27;s international bandwidth. The indecision over the second network operator Neotel, to Telkom&#x27;s advantage, is also not considered to be in the public interest.

Telkom has also attracted attention for improperly conducting itself in a contract dispute with Telcordia on account of non-delivery of an integrated FlowThru solution, resulting in a decision from the Supreme Court of Appeal against its favor in which the judge described Telkom&#x27;s legal team as conducting &quot;verbal manipulation&quot;.

On 19 January 2007, a full-page advertisement was taken out in The &quot;Mail and Guardian&quot;, a national South African newspaper. Money for the ad was donated by dissatisfied South African individuals and businesses. The page was used as a public outcry, detailing some of the things Telkom has done, in hopes of bringing more attention to the current situation in South Africa&#x27;s telecoms industry. The effort was organised by the Telecoms Action Group, TAG.

===ADSL capping===
Perhaps one of the biggest criticisms of Telkom was its introduction of a monthly traffic limit or &quot;cap&quot;. According to Telkom, this was a measure instituted in order for the South African network not to become &quot;congested&quot; with an overflow of information. However, the general feeling in the South African ADSL community is that monthly traffic limits were strategically put in place by Telkom in order to obtain the maximum amount of money from ADSL users. This is mainly because Telkom offers extra bandwidth to users for a price. If the limit is exceeded during the course of the month, the ADSL connection is capped, denying international access to the web, while allowing access to local websites, until the end of the month. The user can purchase extra GBs after he/she is capped however. The typical monthly traffic limits can be used up in less than a day, even on low-speed lines.

===Shaping===

Another major criticism of Telkom was its institution of port prioritization or &quot;shaping&quot;. This also was a measure introduced by Telkom in order for networks throughout South Africa not to become congested with too much information. However, port prioritization was an idea conceived mainly to benefit businesses in which employees all shared the same internet connection. Employees who used &quot;bandwidth hogging&quot; applications such as peer-to-peer (P2P) applications and network-intense online games often slowed down the network dramatically, preventing users who wished to browse web pages or check their mail to do so in a short space of time. Port prioritization solves this problem as it prioritizes certain ports for certain applications. It works according to a protocol which includes all ports and applications generally used in conjunction with them. These ports are sorted into a list of sorts. At the top of the list appear web browsing and email. These ports and the applications which use them receive the most bandwidth from the network. At the very bottom of the list are peer to peer applications, online games and virtual private networking (VPN). These receive very little if not no bandwidth from the network. Being unable to establish international VPN connections on the standard package has a detrimental effect on international freelancers who must pay for the much more expensive &#x27;unshaped&#x27; service. Although it is the ideal solution for large companies, there is no choice in the shaping matter. Personal connections to the internet also get shaped. This has caused an uproar in the South African P2P and online gaming community as one has to pay over exorbitant prices (roughly two times more) to get their connections &quot;unshaped.&quot;

===Fine===

In June 2013, Telkom accepted a R200 million fine to settle complaints that it used its dominant market position to block competition from other network providers.

<doc id="861735" wikidata="Q469684" url="?curid=861735" title="Yerofey Khabarov">
<text>Yerofey Pavlovich Khabarov-Svyatitsky (; 1603 – after 1671), was a Russian entrepreneur and adventurer, best known for his exploring the Amur river region and his attempts to colonize the area for Russia. For background, see Russian–Manchu border conflicts.

The major Russian city of Khabarovsk, and the small town and railway station Yerofey Pavlovich (located on the Trans-Siberian railroad in Amur Oblast) bear his name. The 1963-built icebreaker &quot;Ledokol-5&quot; was renamed &quot;Yerofey Khabarov&quot; in 1966.

A native of the Veliky Ustyug area in the northern European Russia, Khabarov was a manager for the Stroganovs at the saltworks in Solvychegodsk. In 1625, Khabarov sailed from Tobolsk to Mangazeya. , He left the town with his expedition three years later and reached the Kheta River (eastern part of Taimyr). In 1630, Khabarov took part in a voyage from Mangazeya to Tobolsk. In 1632–1641, he reached the Lena River and founded a farming settlement with saltworks along the Lena at the mouths of the Kuta and Kirenga Rivers. Now his descendants live in Stavropol.

==First Expedition 1649–50==

In 1649, he became the second Russian to explore the Amur after Vassili Poyarkov (1643–1646). Poyarkov&#x27;s route up the Aldan River was too difficult to be practical. At some point, Khabarov attempted to reach the Amur via the Vitim River. In 1647, a hunter returned to Yakutsk from the Olyokma River and reported that this might lead to the Amur. In the spring of 1649 Khabarov set off at his own expense up the Olyokma River, then its branch, the Tungir and portaged to the Shilka River. Reaching the upper Amur (Dauria) in early 1650, he found the country nearly deserted, the cossacks&#x27; reputation having preceded them. Having pioneered a good route, he returned to Yakutsk in May, 1650 and gave his report. He praised the land, warned of the danger of Chinese intervention and suggested a larger expedition with professional soldiers.

==Second Expedition 1650–53==

Given the time delays in communicating with Moscow, the Yakutsk Voivode Dmitry Frantsbekov decided to act independently and sent Khabarov back south with a larger force. The voivode also gave Khabarov letters from His Majesty Tsar Alexis to the Daurian Prince Lavkai of Albazin and &quot;Prince Bogdoi&quot; () asking those potentates to submit to the Russian Tsar, and threatening to send a 6,000-strong army if they don&#x27;t obey.

Frantsbekov assumed that this Prince Bogdoi was another Siberian chieftain. He was, in fact, the Emperor of China.

Khabarov crossed the mountains in the fall of 1650 and this time was met with armed resistance. He built winter quarters at Albazin at the northernmost point of the Amur. After receiving reinforcements in June 1651 he set off down the Amur. By September, they reached the mouth of the Sungari. By 29 September, they reached Achansk near present-day Khabarovsk and decided to winter there. On 8 October, they were attacked by about 1,000 local people, who, being defeated, appealed to their Manchu overlords. On March 24, 1652, 2,000 Manchus and Koreans armed with artillery arrived from Ninguta and attacked Achansk. Khabarov somehow managed to defeat them. (The Manchu general, Haise, was later executed for his incompetence) Not knowing how many more Chinese were in the area, on 22 April he withdrew up the Amur. At one point, he encountered another force of 6,000 Chinese but was able to slip around them under cover of fog and darkness. Further upstream he met a force of 117 cossacks who had been sent as reinforcements. He learned from a captive that a new Manchu army was being gathered on the Sungari. On August 1 he reached the mouth of the Zeya. Here 136 of his men mutinied leaving only 212 loyal. (Since Khabarov mentions the mutiny immediately after mentioning where to build winter quarters, it may have been connected with whether it was wise to remain on the Zeya and await a possible Manchu attack.) From the Zeya, he sent a report [7][7] to the Yakutsk Voivode matter-of-factly describing the burning of villages, to the Yakutsk Voivode matter-of-factly describing the burning of villages, slaughter of natives and the torture of prisoners. 

From this point the English sources become unclear. They apparently wintered at the Zeya. In the fall of 1653, 150 reinforcements under Dimitry Zinoviev appeared. As a nobleman, Zinoviev demanded full command. When Khabarov refused, he was arrested. Unable to gain the support of Khabarov&#x27;s men and having no adequate way to deal with the Manchus, Zinoviev and part of the force withdrew from the Amur. Onufriy Stepanov was left in charge of those who remained.

Khabarov was deprived of his rank and property and was sent on a fifteen-month journey to Moscow to be tried. After a year&#x27;s delay he was acquitted. He was given a minor noble rank (&quot;Syn boyarsky&quot; of Ilimsk) on the condition that he return to Siberia. He reappears again in the records in 1658 when the Siberian Office ordered that he be placed in irons if he refused to guide a new expedition to the Amur. After that he disappears from the records.

Khabarov charted the Amur river in his &quot;Draft of the Amur river&quot; ().

<doc id="861740" wikidata="Q1049544" url="?curid=861740" title="Kykuit">
<text>Kykuit ( ), known also as the John D. Rockefeller Estate, is a 40-room historic house museum in Pocantico Hills, a hamlet in the town of Mount Pleasant, New York north of New York City. The house was built for oil tycoon and Rockefeller family patriarch John D. Rockefeller. Conceived largely by his son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., and enriched by the art collection of the third-generation scion, Governor of New York, and Vice President of the United States, Nelson Rockefeller, it was home to four generations of the family. The house is a National Historic Landmark owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and tours are given by Historic Hudson Valley.

Kykuit (in modern Dutch spelling &quot;Kijkuit&quot;, also &quot;uitkijk&quot;, is a compound noun meaning &quot;lookout, look-out&quot;) is situated on the highest point in Pocantico Hills, overlooking the Hudson River at Tappan Zee. Located near Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, it has a view of the New York City skyline to the south.

==History==
John D. Rockefeller purchased land in the area as early as 1893, after his brother William had moved into a 204-room mansion, Rockwood Hall, nearby. When Rockefeller and his son chose Pocantico Hills as their residence, he quietly purchased multiple homes and properties in the area, and used the houses for himself and his family and staff, or to rent out. Rockefeller and his wife Laura Spelman Rockefeller moved into one of these, the Parsons-Wentworth House, in 1893. The couple would spend winter weekends and parts of each summer and fall there, sharing the upstairs rooms with their adult children and in-laws, pending construction of the manor house.

The Parsons-Wentworth House burned down on September 17, 1902, and the Kent House became their temporary residence until rebuilding could occur. &quot;The New York Times&quot; mentioned that Rockefeller had never been satisfied with the destroyed house&#x27;s electric wiring, which had been installed before certain safety measures were developed. He had ordered workers to reroute the wires into conduits, work which had been planned to commence the day after it was pre-empted by the fire. The loss was estimated at $40,000.

Kykuit was designed originally as a steep-roofed three-story stone mansion by the architects Chester Holmes Aldrich and William Adams Delano. Aldrich was a distant relative of the younger Rockefeller&#x27;s wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, who was involved as artistic consultant and in the interior design of the mansion.

The initial eclectic structure took six years to complete. Before being occupied, it was substantially rebuilt into its present four-story Classical Revival Georgian form. Completed in 1913, it has two basement levels filled with interconnecting passageways and service tunnels. The home&#x27;s interiors were designed by Ogden Codman Jr., and feature collections of Chinese and European ceramics, fine furnishings, and 20th-century art.

The estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. In 1979, its occupant, Nelson Rockefeller, bequeathed upon his death his one-third interest in the estate to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Today, Kykuit is open to the public for tours conducted by Historic Hudson Valley.

Kykuit was renovated and modernized in 1995 by New Haven architect Herbert S. Newman and Partners. Included were major infrastructure changes enabling the estate to accommodate group tours of the first floor and art gallery, as well as a reconfiguration of third and fourth floor staff quarters into guest suites.

== Gardens ==


Initially, the task of landscaping of the grounds was assigned to the Olmsted Brothers firm. Rockefeller Senior was unhappy with their work, however, and assumed control of the design himself, transplanting whole mature trees, designing lookouts and the several scenic winding roads. In 1906, the further design of Kykuit&#x27;s grounds was undertaken by architect William Welles Bosworth, who designed the surrounding terraces and gardens with fountains, pavilions and classical sculpture. These gardens in the Beaux-Arts style are considered some of Bosworth&#x27;s best work in the United States, looking out over very fine views of the Hudson River. A few years later, Bosworth would design the Neo-Classical main building complex and landscaping for the new campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Bosworth&#x27;s original gardens still exist, with plantings carefully replaced over time, although his entrance forecourt was extended in 1913. The terraced gardens include a Morning Garden, Grand Staircase, Japanese Garden, Italian Garden, Japanese-style brook, Japanese Tea-house, large Oceanus fountain, Temple of Aphrodite, loggia, and semicircular rose garden.

==Art collection==
Distributed through the estate are numerous artworks reflecting the tastes of the past occupants. Governor Nelson Rockefeller collected and displayed many 20th century artworks, with a focus on abstract works from the 1950s through the 1970s. He was also very influential in the selection of artworks for the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection, located next to the New York State Capitol in Albany, New York.

Nelson Rockefeller transformed previously empty basement passages beneath the mansion that had led to a grotto into a major private art gallery containing paintings by Picasso, Chagall, and Warhol, the latter two having visited the estate. Between 1935 and the late 1970s more than 120 works of abstract, avant-garde, and modern sculpture from Nelson&#x27;s collection were added to the gardens and grounds, including works by Pablo Picasso (&quot;Bathers&quot;), Constantin Brâncuși, Karel Appel (&quot;Mouse on Table&quot;), Jean Arp, Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti, Georg Kolbe (&quot;Ruf der Erde&quot;), Gaston Lachaise, Aristide Maillol, Henry Moore, Louise Nevelson, Isamu Noguchi (&quot;Black Sun&quot;), and David Smith.

==Public tours==
The inner park area was opened to restricted conducted tours of the mansion and immediate surrounds in 1994, but remains occupied and controlled by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which leased the area from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1991 and serves as steward of what is referred to as &quot;the historic area&quot;.

Public tours are conducted by Historic Hudson Valley, an organization established in 1951 by John D. Rockefeller Jr. &quot;to celebrate the region&#x27;s history, architecture, landscape, and material culture, advancing its importance and thereby assuring its preservation.&quot; Shuttle vans run from a visitor center located at the Philipsburg Manor House on Route 9 in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

==Pocantico, the family estate==


The estate, known as Pocantico or Pocantico Hills, occupies an area of . During much of the 20th century, the estate featured a resident workforce of security guards, gardeners, and laborers, and had its own farming, cattle, and food supplies. It has a nine-hole, reversible golf course, and at one time had 75 houses and 70 private roads, most designed by John D. Rockefeller Sr. and his son. A longstanding witticism about the estate quips: &quot;It&#x27;s what God would have built, if only He had the money&quot;.

In 1901, John D. Rockefeller Sr. hired golf course architect Willie Dunn, the designer of Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, to build a golf course on the grounds.

In late 1946, two of Junior&#x27;s sons, John D. Rockefeller III and Laurance Rockefeller, each offered their respective residences, Fieldwood Farm and Rockwood Hall, as headquarters for the then newly formed United Nations. Family patriarch Rockefeller Junior vetoed the proposals, as the sites were too isolated from Manhattan. He instead tasked his second son, Nelson, to buy a site along the East River in New York City, which was subsequently donated for the construction of the UN Headquarters.

Among guests hosted by Nelson and his brother David have been American Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan, and their wives. Other notable visitors have included United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, President of the Republic of South Africa Nelson Mandela, Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, King Hussein of Jordan, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, and Lord Mountbatten of Burma of the United Kingdom.

, 10 or so Rockefeller families lived within the estate, in the central compound and beyond. Much land has been donated over the decades to New York State, including the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, and is open to the public for horseback riding, biking, and jogging. Bill Clinton, who lives just north of the estate, in Chappaqua, has taken regular runs in the State Park.

===Residences===
Within the park:
* &quot;Hawes House&quot;, home of Nelson Rockefeller
* &quot;Kent House&quot;, home of Laurance Rockefeller

Outside the park:
* &quot;Abeyton Lodge&quot;, home of John D. Rockefeller Jr., demolished when he occupied Kykuit after his father&#x27;s death
* &quot;Fieldwood Farm&quot;, home of John D. Rockefeller III
* &quot;Hillcrest&quot;, a Rockefeller University property, formerly the mansion built for Martha Baird Rockefeller, second wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr., and current location of the 3-story underground bunker housing the Rockefeller Archive Center
* &quot;Hudson Pines&quot;, home of David Rockefeller, just north of the Park (), originally built for and occupied by his only sister, Abby
* &quot;Hunting Lodge&quot;, second home of Nelson Rockefeller
* &quot;Rockwood Hall&quot;, originally the property of John D. Rockefeller Sr.&#x27;s brother, William Rockefeller, and currently part of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve

===Notable outbuildings===
* The Pocantico Conference Center of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF), in the Park, where there are regular conferences.

: Originally the &quot;Coach Barn&quot;, a three-story complex ultimately redesigned and completed during 1913–14, in heavy stone from the local area, it was the first new structure built on the estate. It is three times the size of the Kykuit mansion. It still houses an impressive collection of horse-drawn carriages, and an equally noteworthy collection of 12 family-owned vintage cars for public viewing, graphically illustrating the development of automotive design from the early to the mid-twentieth century.

:In 1994, with funding from David Rockefeller and brother Laurance, its lower floor was converted by the New Haven architects Herbert S. Newman and Partners into a modern, fully equipped meeting facility for the Fund&#x27;s conferences, with limited overnight accommodations on the upper floor. The facilities, furthering the projects and objectives of the RBF through conferences, seminars, workshops and retreats for RBF staff, are also available to both domestic and foreign nonprofit organizations, including annual gatherings of all the major foundation presidents and UN Security Council officials, among numerous other dignitaries.
* The &quot;Playhouse&quot;, the family seat. In the park, this is the location, since 1994, of the regular semi-annual family meetings, in June and December.

:A rambling French Norman two-story structure completed by Junior during 1927, this structure is also three times the size of the Kykuit mansion. Standing alongside the nine-hole, reversible golf course, an outdoor swimming pool and two tennis courts, it contains an indoor swimming pool and tennis court, fully equipped basketball gym, squash court, billiard room and full-size bowling alley. It also has dining and living rooms, and a huge reception room resembling an English baronial hall.

* The Orangerie, housing citrus plants, this is modeled after the original at the Palace of Versailles
* Breuer Guest House, a modern house that was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, then disassembled, shipped to, and reassembled at the estate.
* Underground Bomb Shelter, the location of cabinet papers and private telephone transcripts delivered to the estate during 1973 - and kept there for an unknown period of time - by the then Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger.
* The Stone Barns Center for Food &amp; Agriculture, outside the park, this was opened by David Rockefeller and Peggy Dulany during 2004 and was established in memory of Rockefeller&#x27;s wife, Peggy. It is a not-for-profit agricultural and educational facility on of farmland, in the middle of the family-donated Rockefeller State Park Preserve, allied to the family-funded Pocantico Central School. It sells organic local produce, meat, and eggs to the nearby public for-profit restaurant, Blue Hill, as well as to local businesses in the Pocantico Hills area.
* The Rockefeller Archive Center, a voluminous three-story underground bunker built below the foundations of the Hillcrest mansion of Martha Baird Rockefeller, situated just outside the Park area. This is an impressively equipped repository of 150-plus years of Rockefeller papers, memorabilia, and other outside organizations&#x27; collections. It is staffed by ten full-time archivists who patrol -long shelves on rails, and it contains, for researchers, the publicly restricted and expurgated family history.

Additionally, family members have had a profound effect on the hamlet of Pocantico Hills, which is situated in the open space of the estate completely surrounded by family-owned land. The Union Church of Pocantico Hills, now owned by Historic Hudson Valley, was built by the Rockefeller family, which commissioned stained-glass windows by Matisse (an abstract rose window, memorializing Abby Aldrich) and by Chagall (the remainder of the windows, emphasizing Biblical prophets and some New Testament themes, and memorializing various members of the family and others). They also helped finance the construction of the local Pocantico Hills School.

<doc id="861741" wikidata="Q1849046" url="?curid=861741" title="Pepper Ann">
<text>Pepper Ann is an American animated television series created by Sue Rose and aired on Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning on ABC. It first premiered on September 13, 1997, and ended on September 2001. It was the first Disney animated television series to be created by a woman.

Tom Warburton, who later created Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, served as the lead character designer for the series.

==Overview==
&quot;Pepper Ann&quot; centers on the trials and tribulations that occur during the titular character&#x27;s adolescence and charts her ups and downs at Hazelnut Middle School. The character originated in a comic strip published in &quot;YM&quot; magazine.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Main===
* Pepper Ann Pearson (voiced by Kathleen Wilhoite) is the titular protagonist of the series, who is a bespectacled, quirky 12-year-old girl whose emotions come out in fantasies. Her conscience, Alter-Ego, often drives her insecurities through misguided advice. She is of Jewish faith from her mother&#x27;s side (as stated in &quot;A Kosher Christmas&quot;).
* Nicky Anais Little (voiced by Clea Lewis) is Pepper Ann&#x27;s female best friend, a very intelligent and sensible, yet soft-spoken overachiever, who often serves as a confidant for Pepper Ann. She can be prone to bursts of rage or extreme emotion and struggles to keep her composure when she feels she is overlooked. Nicky keeps to a pescetarian diet (which has only been broken once).
* Milo Kamalani (voiced by Danny Cooksey) is Pepper Ann&#x27;s male best friend, a laid-back and mellow hippie who prides himself in his artistic &quot;talent&quot;. Milo is driven by passion, which can sometimes ostracize him from his peers. In early seasons, he is often her partner in crime with her schemes.
* Lydia Pearson (voiced by April Winchell) is the mother of Pepper Ann and Moose and the ex-wife of Chuck. She is a salesclerk working with the fashion store &quot;It&#x27;s You!&quot; at Hazelnut Mall. 
* Margaret Rose &quot;Moose&quot; Pearson (voiced by Pamela Adlon) is Pepper Ann&#x27;s stoic younger 7-year-old sister with an androgynous appearance, whose favorite pastime is skateboarding.
* Craig Bean (voiced by Jeff Bennett) is a &quot;cool&quot; 8th grader whom the 7th graders admire. He serves as Pepper Ann&#x27;s main love interest, as they both have hidden crushes on each other.

===Recurring===
* Dieter Liederhosen (voiced by Jeff Bennett) is a German student in Pepper Ann&#x27;s class with an articulate appreciation for food.
* Trinket St. Blair (voiced by Jenna von Oÿ) is a spoiled, rich, popular girl who often serves as a foil to Pepper Ann. 
* Cissy Rooney (voiced by Kath Soucie) is an air-headed popular girl who is Trinket&#x27;s best friend.
* Tessa &amp; Vanessa James (both voiced by Cree Summer) are two gossipy black twin sisters who finish each other&#x27;s sentences.
* Janie Lilly Diggity (voiced by Susan Tolsky) is the aunt of Pepper Ann and Moose and Lydia&#x27;s sister. A former member of the Peace Corp, she spends her time as an activist. 
* Jo Jo Diggity (voiced by Tino Insana) is Pepper Ann and Moose&#x27;s uncle and Janie&#x27;s husband who works as a cop.
* Nedward &quot;Ned&quot; Diggity (voiced by Jeff Bennett) is the socially inept son of Janie and Jo Jo, and Pepper Ann&#x27;s cousin, who has an affinity for cheese.
* Peter &quot;Pink-Eye Pete&quot; Ogilvy (voiced by Jeff Bennett) is a nerdy kid who suffers from pink eye.
* Alice Kane (voiced by Lauren Tom) is Pepper Ann&#x27;s pompous (sometimes egomaniacal) academic rival. She presents a superficially mature attitude in spite of being just as competitive as Pepper Ann.
* Gwen Mezzrow (voiced by Kimmy Robertson) is a bubbly girl who constantly alternates between pining for Milo and being entirely uninterested in him in favor of Dieter, who is indifferent to her affection.
* Stuart Walldinger (voiced by Luke Perry in Season 2 &amp; Cam Clarke in Season 3 onwards) is Nicky&#x27;s bookish boyfriend, whose main hobby is RC car-racing. He holds a reserved attitude but has a tendency to act out and bottle his emotions.
* Constance Goldman (voiced by Candi Milo) is a shy, awkward girl who looks up to Pepper Ann.
* Shelf McClain (voiced by Jeff Bennett) is a large, academically stunted Scottish student in Pepper Ann&#x27;s class who bullies other students and steals their lunch money.
* Chuck Pearson (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is the estranged ex-husband of Lydia and father of Pepper Ann and Moose. He works as a blimp pilot and speaks with a Mid-Atlantic accent.
* Sherrie Spleen (voiced by April Winchell) is the TV anchorwoman for Channel 96 in Hazelnut.
* Margot LeSandre (voiced by Kathy Najimy) is a snooty saleswoman who is rivals with Lydia and Janie.
* &quot;Shouty Kid&quot; Sean LeSandre (voiced by Pamela Adlon) is the son of Margot, and Moose&#x27;s crush. He is most recognizable for his booming voice.
* Sketch (voiced by Karen Duffy) is an 8th grader whom Pepper Ann admires for her &quot;coolness&quot;. She values loyalty but is shown to be somewhat aloof.
* Crash (voiced by Adam Wylie) is Moose&#x27;s neurotic best friend.
* Crying Girl (typically voiced by Cree Summer &amp; Kath Soucie) is an unfortunate girl who often breaks down in tears at the slightest mishap, most often Pepper Ann&#x27;s misadventures.
* Lamar Abu-Dabe (voiced by Kenny Blank) is a 7th grader and a classmate of Pepper Ann&#x27;s whom Constance has a crush on.

===Hazelnut Middle School===
* Principal Herbert Hickey (voiced by Don Adams) is the school&#x27;s tough disciplinarian with zero tolerance for Pepper Ann&#x27;s shenanigans. This was Adams&#x27;s final role on television.
* Ms. Vera Groober-Schwartz (voiced by Paddi Edwards) is the school&#x27;s secretary.
* Mr. Roland Carter (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a science teacher who is passionate about what he teaches. He is known for giving Pepper Ann detention slips but does believe that she can be a good student even when she successfully does her assignments.
* Ms. Abriola Stark (voiced by April Winchell) is the math teacher who is also in charge of the drama club.
* Ms. Bronte Bladdar (voiced by BeBe Neuwirth) is a stoic English teacher (who often substitutes for art teacher Ms. Ford) who speaks in deadpan-monotone mannerisms.
* Mr. Sherman Finky (voiced by Don Lake) is the social studies teacher. He presents a hip (if not out-of-touch) demeanor, but is no-nonsense when it comes to shirking projects.
* Ms. Carlotta Sneed (voiced by Julia Sweeney) is the economics teacher whose main hobby is knitting.

==Broadcast and home media==
&quot;Pepper Ann&quot; was aired as part of the Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning block on ABC from 1997 to 2001. Select new episodes of the show were also shown (alongside reruns) on Disney&#x27;s One Too on UPN during the 2000–01 season, and later on Disney Channel from 2001-02.

Pepper Ann joined Toon Disney alongside Disney’s Doug on an hour-long primetime block called The Magical World of Toons that premiered in September 2001. With this block, some previously unaired episodes that had never aired on ABC or UPN made their debut on Toon Disney. The show aired on the channel until 2004, with a special one-off marathon airing in 2008 after several years off the air. 

All 65 episodes of the series were included on Disney+ on September 8, 2021 in the United States, with the episodes from season 4 listed under season 3 on the platform (due to them being produced concurrently), along with the episodes being listed in their package order.

Internationally, the show aired on GMTV in the UK and RTÉ in Ireland.

== Scrapped Film ==
In 1999, an animated film based on the series was in development at Walt Disney Television Animation and Walt Disney Pictures under the name &quot;Pepper Ann&#x27;s Rio Adventure.&quot; The movie would have followed Pepper Ann&#x27;s soccer team being invited to Rio De Janeiro as part of an event where they try to stop a land developer from deforesting the Amazon River. The movie was scrapped due to unknown reasons, however concept art of the film by animation director Richard Bowman was posted onto eBay in recent years, the most recent piece being posted in July 2024. It is unknown whether or not the film was intended to be theatrical or made for television.

<text>An integrated digital television (IDTV or iDTV) set is a television set with a built in digital tuner, be it for DVB-T2, DVB-S2, DVB-C, DMB-T/H, ATSC standards or ISDB. Most of them also allow reception of analogue signals (PAL, SÉCAM or NTSC). They do away with the need for a set-top box for converting those signals for reception on a television.

Most iDTVs do not inherently include support for pay TV, and as a result many are fitted with common interface slots to allow the use of a conditional-access module. They may also include support for other features of a digital television &quot;platform&quot;, such as an interactive television engine and support for some form of return channel. A small number of iDTVs include a digital video recorder, which removes the need for an external PVR, possibly requiring its own digital set-top box.

The particular tuner varies by country. For example, in many European countries such as Germany and Sweden, DVB-C (cable) is the most common digital TV tuner in televisions, whereas in the UK, most televisions have a DVB-T (terrestrial) tuner instead.

<text>Wendy M. Grossman (born January 26, 1954) is a journalist, blogger, and folksinger. Her writing has been published in several newspapers, magazines, and specialized publications. She is the recipient of the 2013 Enigma Award for information security reporting.

==Education==
Grossman was born in New York City. She graduated from Cornell University in 1975.

==Career==
===Writer and editor===

In 1987, she founded the magazine &quot;The Skeptic&quot; in the United Kingdom, which she edited for some time. As founder and editor, she has appeared on numerous UK TV and radio programmes. Her credits since 1990 include work for &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, as well as &quot;New Scientist&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Wired News&quot;, and &quot;The Inquirer&quot; for which she wrote a regular weekly &quot;net.wars&quot; column. That column continues in &quot;NewsWireless&quot; and on her own site every Friday. She was a columnist for &quot;Internet Today&quot; from July 1996 until it closed in April 1997, and together with Dominic Young ran the Fleet Street Forum on CompuServe UK in the mid-1990s.

She edited an anthology of interviews with leading computer industry figures taken from the pages of the British computer magazine &quot;Personal Computer World&quot;. Entitled &quot;Remembering the Future&quot;, it was published in January 1997 by Springer Verlag. Her 1998 book &quot;net.wars&quot; was one of the first to have its full text published on the Web.
She was a member of an external board that advised Edinburgh University on the creation of the Intellectual Property and Law Centre.

She sits on the executive committee of the Association of British Science Writers and the Advisory Councils of the Open Rights Group and Privacy International.
In February 2011 Grossman was elected as a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

===Folk singer===
Grossman was a full-time folk singer from 1975 to 1983 and her folk album &quot;Roseville Fair&quot; was released in 1980. She also played on Archie Fisher&#x27;s 1976 LP &quot;The Man With a Rhyme&quot;.

She was president of the Cornell Folk Song Club, the oldest university-affiliated, student-run folk song club in the US, from 1973 to 1975.

In 2024, Grossman released a 13-track album &quot;The Last Trip Home&quot; through Riverlark Music. Described as &quot;a mixed-up baker&#x27;s dozen&quot;, it includes instrumentals plus ballads traditional and contemporary.

==TV appearances==
In 2005, Grossman featured on an episode of the BBC Three comedy spoof series &quot;High Spirits with Shirley Ghostman&quot;.

==Awards==
In 2013, Grossman was the winner of the Enigma Award, part of the BT Information Security Journalism Awards, &quot;for her dedication and outstanding contribution to information security journalism, recognising her extensive writing on the subject for several publications over a number of years&quot;.

<text>Eugène Fromentin (; 24 October 182027 August 1876) was a French painter and writer.

==Life and career==
He was born in La Rochelle. After leaving school he studied for some years under Louis Cabat, the landscape painter. Fromentin was one of the earliest pictorial interpreters of Algeria, having been able, while quite young, to visit the land and people that suggested the subjects of most of his works, and to store his memory as well as his portfolio with the picturesque and characteristic details of North African life. His first great success was produced at the Salon of 1847, by the &quot;Gorges de la Chiffa&quot;. In 1849, he was awarded a medal of the second class.

In 1852, he paid a second visit to Algeria, accompanying an archaeological mission, and then completed that minute study of the scenery of the country and of the habits of its people which enabled him to give to his after-work the realistic accuracy that comes from intimate knowledge.

His books include &#x27; (&quot;The Masters of Past Time&quot;, 1876), an influential appreciation of Early Netherlandish painting and the Northern Baroque of the Old Masters of Belgium and Holland, &quot;Dominique&quot; and &quot;A Summer in the Sahara&quot;. In &#x27; he deals with the complexity of paintings by Rubens, Rembrandt and others, their style and the artists&#x27; emotions at the time of creating their masterpieces. He is also one of the first &quot;art critics&quot; to approach the subject of &quot;The Old Masters&quot; from a personal point of view – being a painter himself. He also puts the work in a social, political and economic context, as the Dutch Golden Age painting develops shortly after Holland won its independence. Bernhard Berenson wrote of the book, &quot;I carry Fromentin with me, and read him each evening about the pictures I have seen that he criticizes. He is the only writer on pictures worth his salt, but I do not always agree with him.&quot;

Fromentin, who maintained that &quot;art is the expression of the invisible by means of the visible,&quot; was much influenced in style by Eugène Delacroix. His works are distinguished by striking composition, great dexterity of handling and brilliancy of colour. In them is given with great truth and refinement the unconscious grandeur of barbarian and animal attitudes and gestures. His later works, however, show signs of an exhausted vein and of an exhausted spirit, accompanied or caused by physical enfeeblement.

But it must be observed that Fromentin&#x27;s paintings show only one side of a genius that was perhaps even more felicitously expressed in literature, though with less profusion. &quot;Dominique&quot;, first published in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot; in 1862, and dedicated to George Sand, is remarkable among the fiction of the century for delicate and imaginative observation and for emotional earnestness.

Fromentin&#x27;s other literary works include &quot;Visites artistiques&quot; (1852); &quot;Simples Pèlerinages&quot; (1856); &quot;Un été dans le Sahara&quot; (1857); &quot;Une année dans le Sahel&quot; (1858). In 1876 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Academy. He died suddenly at La Rochelle on 27 August 1876.

<text>The Harkness table, Harkness method, or Harkness discussion is a teaching and learning method involving students seated in a large, oval configuration to discuss ideas in an encouraging, open-minded environment with only occasional or minimal teacher intervention.

==Overview==
The Harkness method is in use at many American boarding schools and colleges and encourages discussion in classes. The style is related to the Socratic method. Developed at Phillips Exeter Academy, the method&#x27;s name comes from the oil magnate and philanthropist Edward Harkness, who presented the school with a monetary gift in 1930. It has been adopted in numerous schools, such as The Dunham School, St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas, Germantown Academy, Milton Academy, The College Preparatory School, The Masters School, and Seoul Foreign School where small class-size makes it effective. However, Harkness remains impractical for schools with larger class sizes. Harkness described its use as follows:

:What I have in mind is [a classroom] where [students] could sit around a table with a teacher who would talk with them and instruct them by a sort of tutorial or conference method, where [each student] would feel encouraged to speak up. This would be a real revolution in methods.

Harkness practices can vary, most notably between humanities subjects such as English and history and technical subjects such as math and physics.

<text>The IBM 1132 [[line printer]] was the normal printer for the IBM 1130 computer system. It printed 120 character lines at 80 lines per minute. The character set consisted of numbers, upper-case letters and some special characters.

The 1965-introduced 1132 was built around a stripped down IBM 407 printing mechanism. The 407 was IBM&#x27;s top-of-the-line accounting machine from the 1950s. The 1130 had 120 power transistors, each wired to the print magnet for one printer column. The magnet released a lever that engaged a cam with a spinning clutch shaft. The engaged cam then made one revolution, pushing its print wheel toward the ribbon and paper, thereby printing one character. 

As the set of 120 print wheels spun, the 1130 received an interrupt as each of the possible 48 characters was about to move into position. The printing driver software had to quickly output a 120 bit vector designating which transistors were to fire so as to drive the print wheel against the ribbon and paper. This put a big performance burden on the CPU, but resulted in an inexpensive (for the time) printer.

Sometimes a printer output line transistor would fail, resulting in a blank print position. If you knew your way around inside the 1130, it was possible to swap circuit cards so as to move the bad print position to near the right end of the printed line. This kept the 1130 usable until the repair person showed up.

The 1132 came in two models with the following characteristics:
* Standard 48-character-set typewheels with A..Z, 0..9 and the symbols codice_1.
* Model 1 prints up to 80 alphameric or 110 numeric lines per minute and can be attached to 1131 CPU Models 1, 2, 3, and 5.
* Model 2 prints up to 40 alphameric or 55 numeric lines per minute and may be attached only to the 1131 CPU Model 4.
* Standard 120 print-line positions spaced 10 characters per inch.
* Operator selection of vertical line spacing, 6 or 8 lines per inch.
* Forms skipping under program control through automatic, paper-tape-controlled carriage.
* Printer operation under stored-program control through automatic interrupt system.
* Direct connection to the 1131 Central Processing Unit by means of the 1132 Printer Attachment and an Expansion Adapter.

<text>Dmitry Leontiyevich Ovtsyn () (unknown - after 1757) was a Russian hydrographer and Arctic explorer. The Ovtsyn family is one of the oldest Russian noble families, originating from the descendants of Rurik, the Murom princes.

==Ovtsyn&#x27;s biography==
Ovtsyn&#x27;s childhood coincided with the time of Peter the Great&#x27;s transformations in Russia. When Ovtsyn graduated from the Academy, he became a Navigator. While still a student at the Academy in 1725, he took part in the first long-distance foreign voyage of the young Russian fleet. 
In 1726 Ovtsyn graduated from the Academy and from 1726 to 1729 sailed on the same frigate &quot;Amsterdam-Galey&quot; as a Navigator student, then a Navigator. The young sailor soon attracted the attention of his superiors and was appointed to the post of adjutant to the chief commander of the Kronstadt port, which at that time was Admiral Thomas Gordon. In 1732, Ovtsyn was promoted to the rank of &quot;non-Lieutenant from the soldiers&quot;. Two years later, due to his having experience and excellent knowledge in navigational and hydrographic matters, Ovtsyn was appointed to the great Northern expedition, led by Vitus Bering.
In 1734–1738, Ovtsyn led one of the units of the Second Kamchatka expedition that charted the coastline of the Kara Sea east of the river Ob. In summer of 1737, his unit made its way from Ob to Yenisei and made the first hydrographic description of this part of the Siberian coastline. In 1741, Ovtsyn took part in Vitus Bering&#x27;s voyage to the shores of America.

==Honours==
A cape on the Taimyr Peninsula and a strait between the islands Oleniy and Sibiryakov bear his name.

<doc id="861767" wikidata="Q711080" url="?curid=861767" title="Geronimo Pratt">
<text>Elmer &quot;Geronimo&quot; Pratt (September 13, 1947 – June 2, 2011), also known as Geronimo Ji-Jaga and Geronimo Ji-Jaga Pratt, was a decorated military veteran and a high-ranking member of the Black Panther Party in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Born in Louisiana, he served two tours in Vietnam, receiving several decorations. He moved to Los Angeles, where he studied at UCLA under the GI Bill and joined the Black Panther Party. He was wrongfully convicted and imprisoned. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation targeted Pratt in a COINTELPRO operation in the early 1970s, intended to &quot;neutralize Pratt as an effective BPP functionary.&quot; Pratt was tried and convicted in 1972 for the 1968 murder of Caroline Olsen; he served 27 years in prison, eight of which were in solitary confinement. Pratt was freed in 1997 when his conviction was vacated due to the prosecution&#x27;s having withheld exculpatory evidence that tended to prove his innocence. This decision was upheld on appeal.

He worked as a human rights activist until the time of his death. Pratt was also the godfather of the late rapper Tupac Shakur. He died of a heart attack in Tanzania, on June 3, 2011.

==Early years and military service==
Elmer Pratt was born in Morgan City, Louisiana, where his father was in the scrap metal business. Pratt was raised Catholic. Pratt was a star quarterback at Sumpter Williams High School.

He served two combat tours as a soldier in the Vietnam War, reaching the rank of sergeant. He was highly decorated, earning two Bronze Stars, a Silver Star, and two Purple Hearts. He later moved to Los Angeles.

==UCLA and Black Panther Party==
After leaving the Army, Pratt studied political science at UCLA, using a grant provided by the GI Bill. Pratt became politically active and was recruited into the Black Panthers by Bunchy Carter and John Huggins. When Pratt joined the Black Panthers, his years in the army proved useful. He rose to become Deputy Minister of Defense of the local organization, after Bunchy Carter and John Huggins were killed by COINTELPRO infiltrators in the Us Organization. He took the name &quot;Geronimo,&quot; after a prominent Apache chief and leader of resistance to US domination, and &quot;Ji-Jaga,&quot; after a Central African tribe.

In 1971, his wife Saundra was killed when she was 8 months pregnant and her body was left in a ditch. The murder was attributed at the time to a BPP schism between supporters of Huey Newton and those of Eldridge Cleaver; Pratt and his wife belonged to the Cleaver faction. Pratt later believed this account was an FBI lie, and that Saundra&#x27;s murder was unrelated to her activities in the Black Panther Party.

By January 1970, the Los Angeles FBI office had sought permission from national headquarters for a counterintelligence effort &quot;designed to challenge the legitimacy of the authority exercised&quot; by Pratt in the local Panthers. Another FBI memo, dated five months later, noted that the Bureau was constantly considering counterintelligence measures designed to neutralize Pratt &quot;as an effective (Panther) functionary.&quot;

==Murder charges==
In 1968, Caroline Olsen, a 27-year-old elementary school teacher, was murdered by gunshot during a robbery on a Santa Monica tennis court. Olsen&#x27;s husband, Kenneth, who was also shot but survived, identified Pratt as the killer in an eyewitness line-up. Julius Butler, a police informant and infiltrator inside the Black Panther Party, testified that Pratt had confessed to him and discussed the murder with him on several occasions. In 1970, Pratt was arrested and charged with murder and kidnapping.

His attorney, Johnnie Cochran, argued that the charges should be dropped. He claimed that Pratt had been 350 miles away on the night of the murder. Pratt was convicted in 1972. Journalist and author Jack Olsen reported that FBI &quot;moles&quot; had infiltrated defense sessions and monitored Cochran&#x27;s phone calls.

==Prison==
While Pratt was incarcerated at Mule Creek State Prison, he studied law and built a defense. Attorney Stuart Hanlon, who had helped represent him in his first trial, and William Paparian worked on the appeals that resulted in Pratt&#x27;s conviction being vacated. In an interview with Reuters he recalled being held in solitary confinement in a cell near cult leader Charles Manson, with only big ants to keep him company.

==Murder conviction vacated==
The conviction was vacated on June 10, 1997, on the grounds that the prosecution had concealed evidence that might have influenced the jury&#x27;s verdict. Police wiretaps showed that he was present at a Black Panther meeting in Oakland, 400 miles away from the murder in L.A. at the time of the murder. The prosecution had not disclosed the extent to which a key witness against Pratt, Julius Butler, was an informant to the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department. The state appealed the decision, but an appeals court in 1999 ruled this fact to be &quot;&#x27;favorable&#x27; to the defendant, &#x27;suppressed&#x27; by a law enforcement agency, and &#x27;material&#x27; to the jury&#x27;s decision to convict;&quot; it upheld the decision to vacate the conviction, freeing him.

On July 24, 1997, Pratt returned to his hometown of Morgan City, Louisiana, to see his aged mother, Eunice. He had not seen her in 23 years, since she rode a bus to visit him at Folsom Prison.

In 1998, Pratt&#x27;s longtime friend and attorney Johnnie Cochran, filed a federal civil lawsuit against the FBI and the LAPD, accusing them of malicious prosecution and false imprisonment. With the help of Brian T. Dunn, another attorney at The Cochran Firm, the suit was settled for $4.5 million. A federal judge approved the settlement of the civil suit: the City of Los Angeles paid $2.75 million of the settlement and the US Department of Justice paid the remaining $1.75 million.

==Later years==
Pratt continued to work until his death on behalf of men and women wrongfully convicted. He participated in rallies in support of Mumia Abu-Jamal, whom he had met when both were active as Black Panthers. In his later years, he moved to Tanzania, where he was living at the time of his death.

<text>George Wald (November 18, 1906 – April 12, 1997) was an American scientist and activist who studied pigments in the retina. He won a share of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Haldan Keffer Hartline and Ragnar Granit.

In 1970, Wald predicted that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”

== Biography ==

George Wald was born in New York City, the son of Ernestine (Rosenmann) and Isaac Wald, Jewish immigrant parents. He was a member of the first graduating class of the Brooklyn Technical High School in New York in 1923. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from New York University in 1927 and his PhD in zoology from Columbia University in 1932. After graduating, he received a travel grant from the US National Research Council. Wald used this grant to work in Germany with Otto Heinrich Warburg where he identified vitamin A in the retina. Wald then went on to work in Zürich, Switzerland, with the discoverer of vitamin A, Paul Karrer. Wald then worked briefly with Otto Fritz Meyerhof in Heidelberg, Germany, but left Europe for the University of Chicago in 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power and life in Europe became more dangerous for Jews. In 1934, Wald went to Harvard University where he became an instructor, then a professor.

Wald was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1950, the American Philosophical Society in 1958, and in 1967 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries in vision. In 1966 he was awarded the Frederic Ives Medal by the OSA and in 1967 the Paul Karrer Gold Medal of the University of Zurich. In 1992, he was elected an Honorary Member of OSA.

Wald spoke out on many political and social issues and his fame as a Nobel laureate brought national and international attention to his views. He was a pacifist and vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and the nuclear arms race. Speaking at MIT in 1969 Wald said, &quot;Our government has become preoccupied with death, with the business of killing and being killed.&quot; In 1980, he served as part of Ramsey Clark&#x27;s delegation to Iran during the Iran hostage crisis.

With a small number of other Nobel laureates, he was invited in 1986 to fly to Moscow to advise Mikhail Gorbachev on a number of environmental questions. While there, he questioned Gorbachev about the arrest, detention and exile of Yelena Bonner and her husband, fellow Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov (Peace prize, 1975). Wald reported that Gorbachev said he knew nothing about it. Bonner and Sakharov were released shortly thereafter, in December 1986.

A member of the Circumcision Resource Center in Boston, he was one of the first scientists committed against circumcision but his article &quot;Circumcision&quot;, rejected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1975, was published in 2012 only by an English magazine().

Wald died in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was married twice: in 1931 to Frances Kingsley (1906–1980) and in 1958 to the biochemist Ruth Hubbard. He had two sons with Kingsley—Michael and David; he and Hubbard had a son—musicologist and musician Elijah Wald—and a daughter, Deborah, a family law attorney. He was an atheist.

== Scientific career ==

As a postdoctoral researcher, Wald discovered that vitamin A was a component of the retina. His further experiments showed that when the pigment rhodopsin was exposed to light, it yielded the protein opsin and a compound containing vitamin A. This suggested that vitamin A was essential in retinal function.

In the 1950s, Wald and his colleagues used chemical methods to extract pigments from the retina. Then, using a spectrophotometer, they were able to measure the light absorbance of the pigments. Since the absorbance of light by retina pigments corresponds to the wavelengths that best activate photoreceptor cells, this experiment showed the wavelengths that the eye could best detect. However, since rod cells make up most of the retina, what Wald and his colleagues were specifically measuring was the absorbance of rhodopsin, the main photopigment in rods. Later, with a technique called microspectrophotometry, he was able to measure the absorbance directly from cells, rather than from an extract of the pigments. This allowed Wald to determine the absorbance of pigments in the cone cells (Goldstein, 2001).
