<text>Fort Street High School (FSHS) is a government-funded, co-educational, academically selective, secondary day school, located in Petersham, an Inner Western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 1849, it is the oldest government high school in Australia, and notably, the first school not founded by a religious organisation. Today, it remains a public school operated by the New South Wales Department of Education. As an academically selective secondary school, it draws students from across greater metropolitan Sydney.

To avoid confusion arising from the school&#x27;s history of separation, amalgamation, and relocation, the present school is designated Fort Street High School, Petersham for official government purposes.

The school&#x27;s Latin motto is &quot;Faber est suae quisque fortunae&quot;, translated as &quot;Each person is the maker of his own fortune&quot;, a phrase attributed to the ancient Roman Appius Claudius Caecus.

Fort Street High School has a sister school, Suginami Sogo High School, in Tokyo, Japan.

In 2010, &quot;The Age&quot; reported that Fort Street High School ranked equal fourth among Australian schools, based on the number of alumni who had been honoured as a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). 

==History==
===Creation of the Fort Street Model School===
The history of public education in Australia began when the governor of New South Wales, Charles FitzRoy, established a Board of National Education on 8 January 1848 to implement a national system of education throughout the Colony. The board decided to create two model schools, one for boys and one for girls. The site of Fort Street Model School was chosen as the old Military Hospital at Fort Phillip, on Observatory Hill. This school was not only intended to educate boys and girls, but also to serve as a model for other schools in the colony. The school&#x27;s name is derived from the name of a street that ran into the grounds of the hospital and became part of the playground during its reconstruction. The street name is perpetuated in the small street in Petersham that leads to the present school.

===Establishment of Fort Street===
The school was officially established on 1 September 1849, when the conversion of the building was approved by the government. This original school building is visible today beside the southern approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The establishment of Fort Street School marked the establishment of a non-denominational system of school, where the government undertook the education of its people, separate from religion. The influence of the Fort Street Model School was substantial, forming the basis for education throughout the colonies:

At the same time at the Fort Street National School in Sydney William Wilkins was teaching pupil-teachers how to lead the children of New South Wales out of darkness into the light. He was holding out to them that bright prospect of the day when every locality however remote and every family however humble was supplied with the ameliorating influences of an education, which would teach every man, woman and child in the colony to form the habits of regularity, cleanliness, orderly behaviour, and regard for the rights of both public and private property, as well as the habit of obedience to the law, and respect for duly constituted authority. In Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart his counterparts were preaching the same gospel of humanity marching forward, reaching upward for the light. – Manning Clark, &quot;A History of Australia, Vol. 4, The Earth Abideth Forever 1851–1888&quot;

In 1881, the school was raised to the status of Superior Public School.

===Formation of Fort Street Public, Boys&#x27; High, and Girls&#x27; High Schools===
In 1911, the school was split into one primary and two secondary schools: Fort Street Public School, Fort Street Boys&#x27; High School and Fort Street Girls&#x27; High School. Due to space limitations at Observatory Hill, in 1916, the Boys&#x27; school was moved to the school&#x27;s present site, on Taverner&#x27;s Hill, Petersham. The Girls&#x27; school remained at Observatory Hill until 1975, when the two schools were amalgamated to form the current co-educational school at Petersham. During that time, its grounds continued to be consumed by the growing city; for example, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which opened in 1932, took most of the playground. Fort Street Public School remains at Observatory Hill.

For many years from 1912 George Mackaness was the English master and deputy headmaster at Fort Street Boys&#x27; High School. He published &quot;Inspirational Teaching&quot; (1928) on his teaching techniques.

===Recent===
The school celebrated its sesquicentenary in 1999. Its student population is now a diverse one; students come from over 100 suburbs in Sydney, from places as far as Hornsby, the Blue Mountains, Cabramatta, Fairfield and Canterbury, and a range of cultural backgrounds. Students past and present are referred to as &quot;Fortians&quot;.

Ronald Horan was for many years a master at the school. As well as writing foreign language textbooks, he was the author of a history of the school, &quot;Fort Street, the School&quot; which was later followed by &quot;Maroon and Silver&quot;.

The school has also undergone a variety of renovations, elevating the facilities of the school.

The school was closed on 30 July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic after the school was advised of a possible case. The school was reopened the next day after a negative result was returned.

Tragically, on August 5 2022, a stonemason working at the school died in an accident. The man was found trapped under stones after scaffolding at the building site at Fort Street High School at around 11:30 am, during a school day. The worker had been restoring the facade of the 170-year-old public school when he was crushed by a sandstone concrete slab weighing several tonnes. The school underwent lockdown procedures before sending students home.

==Campus==
Fort Street High School is located on a single campus adjacent to Parramatta Road in Petersham, a suburb in the inner-west of Sydney. The school occupies almost the entire street block, and is surrounded by Parramatta Road, Palace Street and Andreas Street with access from Fort Street.

The Petersham campus centres on the Romanesque Revival main building (formerly known to most staff and students simply as &quot;the old block&quot;) now named the Wilkins Building after William Wilkins, who played an instrumental role in the formation of the education system in New South Wales in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The other buildings include the Kilgour building, the Memorial Hall and the newest additions, the Cohen and Rowe buildings, which were completed in 2004.

School facilities include a library, a gymnasium, an oval, futsal courts, basketball courts, volleyball courts, cricket practice nets, a canteen, a STEM makerspace and a performing arts block.

After years of campaigning for insulation, the school received funding for noise reduction technology, as it is located beneath an air corridor. Work on in the school was scheduled to start in mid-2010 and began in the Memorial Hall at the request of the school principal, Roslynne Moxham, to provide a quiet environment for exams being held in the hall including the Higher School Certificate. It was completed in January 2012, with the completion of insulation in the Wilkins and Kilgour blocks.

The school&#x27;s original Observatory Hill campus is now used by the National Trust of Australia.

==Academics==
Fort Street High School teaches all six grades of a standard secondary education in New South Wales, from year 7 to 12. It operates under the New South Wales Department of Education and Training (DET) and is registered and accredited with the New South Wales Education Standards Authority, and therefore following the mandated curriculum for all years. Administratively, the six grades are divided into three &quot;Stages&quot; of two years each: Stage 4 (years 7 and 8), Stage 5 (years 9 and 10) and Stage 6 (years 11 and 12).

Years 7 to 10 are traditionally regarded as &quot;junior&quot; high school, and until its discontinuation in 2011, officially concluded with attainment of the School Certificate at the end of year 10. Compulsory subjects during these years are English, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography and Physical Education. In addition, Visual Arts, Drama, and Design &amp; Technology are compulsory in year 7. The same subjects are compulsory for year 8, however without Drama. Students also learn two different languages in year 7, they are not able to choose which ones. In year 8 they are allowed to choose one language out of the 4 options to learn for the whole year. They may choose from French, German, Chinese and Japanese.

In years 9 and 10, students choose three elective subjects, from amongst Languages (French, German, Chinese, or Japanese), Elective History, Elective Geography (so-called to differentiate them from the compulsory History and Geography course), Creative and Performing Arts (Music, Drama and Visual Arts), Industrial Technologies (ICT, Engineering, and Food Technology), and Commerce.

In Stage 6, or years 11 and 12, students prepare for the Higher School Certificate (HSC), which certifies the completion of high school in New South Wales. In order to satisfy requirements for the HSC, each student must complete at least twelve units of study for the Preliminary course (in year 11) and at least ten units for the HSC (in Year 12). The only compulsory subject is English. Students have the option of undertaking Vocational education (VET) courses, which may or may not contribute to their Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) in the HSC.

==Extra-curricular activities==
===Sport===
Fort Street High also offers sports as part of its formal and co-curricular programs. Year 7 to 10 students experience sports through the Physical Education program, and Years 8 to 11 have the option to participate in zone and knockout sports. Year 12 students are not required to undertake sport but may partake if requested. Students who are not involved in competition undertake in Year 8 skill-based sport, and in Years 9 to 11 recreational sports. Sports offered include Ultimate Frisbee, hockey, rugby union, aerobics, basketball, ice skating, netball, K-pop dancing, pilates, soccer, water polo, cricket, tennis, baseball, volleyball, recreational gym, Oz-tag, rock climbing and touch football.

===Instrumental Music Program (IMP)===
The Instrumental Music Program is the largest co-curricular program in the school involving over 300 students. In 2002, it won the Director-General&#x27;s School Achievement Award for providing opportunities for students to enrich and expand their expertise as musicians and performers. The large ensembles include the Wind Ensemble, Wind Orchestra, Concert Band, Training Band, Symphony Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra and Vocal Ensemble. In addition, the extension ensembles include the Jazz Orchestra, Big Band, Jazz Ensemble, Percussion Ensembles, and Chamber Choir.

===Charity Committees===
Each year group has a charity committee, focusing on different issues and charities throughout the year. They often hold highly successful fundraising stalls, such as cake stalls, student hairspray salons, live entertainment, raffles and gold-coin donation drives. In 2015, the Year 8 Charity Committee (class of 2019) established a team to participate in the annual Seven Bridges Walk, raising over $21,100. They have since established this as an annual tradition, where over $88,351 has been raised by the Year 8 Charity Committees from 2015-2019 inclusive. 


It is also a tradition for the Year 12 Charity Committee to run the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Shave&quot;, an annual fundraiser run by the Leukaemia Foundation which raises awareness and funds for blood cancer research and treatment. 
===Robotics Club (FSHS Robotics)===
FSHS Robotics is a student-run robotics club with the aim of providing students passionate in STEM with a holistic experience of engineering from conception to production in preparation for the RoboCup Junior Australia (RCJA) competition.

=== Chess ===
Fort Street High School offers chess as an extracurricular activity after school. Fort Street High School participates in the Metropolitan Secondary Schools Competition, a weekly inter school teams competition between secondary schools, both independent and government-funded, offered by the NSW Junior Chess League.

===Maker Society===
The Fort Street High School Maker Society is a co-curricular group where students can complete a variety of STEM activities. Students choose one or more STEM-related activities such as the Aeronautical Velocity, STEM Video Game or Formula 1 in Schools challenges and work on the activity during Maker Society sessions, all under the supervision and guidance of the TAS (Technology and Applied studies) teachers. It provides a social hub to inspire students to start their own projects, as well as a makerspace which contains facilities such as a laser cutter, multiple 3D printers, a CNC machine and various electronic test equipment.

===Student Representative Council (SRC)===
The student body is represented by the Student Representative Council (SRC). Four male and four female students from each year are elected by their peers at the end of the third term of each year, excepting Year 7 Representatives, who are voted in the beginning of the year. The executive team is elected from Year 10 members of the SRC at the beginning of Term 4. It consists of a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, and is elected by a combination of weighted votes from the school&#x27;s staff and members of the elected SRC.

The SRC is responsible for the annual Valentine&#x27;s Day Rose Drive, among other events and fundraising efforts throughout the year.

The SRC also run, in collaboration with the P&amp;C, the biennial Fort Street Festival (Fort Fest), which allows students to open a stall at the school on the day, usually a Sunday at the beginning of June. It features a Talent Quest (previously the Battle of the Bands), a program where individuals and groups compete to win prizes. There are stalls from various student groups, including the Environment Committee, the Student Anti-Racism Network, and Amnesty International. In 2010, other stalls included Nova 96.9, NSW Police and the NSW Fire Department. Fort Fest has not been run since pre-Covid times.

===Environment Committee===
The Environment Committee is a student body that was formed in late 2007 by Paul Pagani, a teacher at the school. The Committee currently has over 40 members ranging from Years 7 to 12, and is led by a President. The Environment Committee works in partnership with other schools in the local area, such as Petersham Public School and Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. In a nod towards the school&#x27;s heritage, the Committee worked closely with the Observatory Hill Environmental Educational Centre, including the planning of EcoTour 2010. The Committee&#x27;s past and present projects include running a Recycling Program run with the assistance of Visy, installing two water tanks (each having a 2000L capacity), installing 6 1.5 kW Solar Panels, regenerating plants with indigenous natives along Andreas Street, controlling a worm farm and running the annual Earth Hour. The Environmental Committee introduced the Composting program in 2022, run on a fortnightly roster with student volunteers. 

===STIVE===
For more than 20 years, Fort Street High School has supported a student led and mentored, voluntary Christian program called STIVE.

===Walking Club===
The Fort Street High School Walking Club is a group where students participate in a range of high intensity exercises. Students exercise on the oval on Tuesday lunches, providing an outlet for community fitness and welfare.

Other extracurricular activities include debating (the Year 7 and 8 team was the state champion in 2010), public speaking, mock trial (Fort Street was the 2009 New South Wales Champions), mooting (Fort Street was the winning team of the 2021 University of Western Sydney Kirby Cup), Tournament of Minds, Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award Scheme, theatresports, photography, and dance.

==School traditions==
Fort Street utilises a house system. The school is organised into five official houses, to which each student is assigned. The houses are named after prominent alumni of the school, each representing different areas of endeavour: Joshi, named after Nalini Joshi, the first female professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sydney; Kirby, named after Michael Kirby, former Justice of the High Court of Australia; Mawson, named after Douglas Mawson, Antarctic explorer; Preston, named after artist Margaret Preston; and Sheikh, named after Simon Sheikh, Australian activist and CEO of superannuation fund Future Super. Houses compete in sporting and academic endeavours for the &quot;Kennedy Cup&quot;, named after athlete Clarice Kennedy.

Since 1899, the school has published &quot;the Fortian&quot; magazine, the school&#x27;s annual review and yearbook. The name later came to refer to all students of the schools past and present. An extensive alumni network is maintained through the school&#x27;s alumni association, the Fortians&#x27; Union, formed by the amalgamation of the Old Boys&#x27; Union and the Fort Street Old Girls&#x27; Union. In addition to maintaining the alumni network, the Union also assists the school and promotes its traditions. It holds an annual dinner each October, with some student reunions held concurrently with this event. The Fortians&#x27; Union publishes &quot;Faber Est&quot;, a monthly newsletter.

An annual Speech Day is held near the beginning of each year at which student achievements are recognised and awards are presented. An address is given by a prominent Fortian, principal and valedictorian of the previous year&#x27;s graduating class. In the past, Speech Day events have been held at various venues, including the school&#x27;s Memorial Hall and the Sydney Opera House. In recent years, the ceremony has been held at Sydney Town Hall.

Throughout its history, the various Fort Street schools have had a number of school songs. At present, at , the simply-named &quot;School Song&quot; which is &quot;Come Let the Strains resound that Echo Fort Street&#x27;s Glory&quot; and &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot; are sung at the beginning of assemblies, with &quot;Fort Street&#x27;s Name Rings Around the World&quot; sung as the , at its conclusion.

FLOP (Fortians&#x27; Last Outstanding Performance), an annual student revue performed by outgoing Year 12 students, has been performed for many years, beginning in 1976. It usually involves humorous sketches, often parodying school life and teachers, and, in the digital era, the primary medium has been video. These are usually filmed in and out of class time after students&#x27; HSC Trial exams, taking place in early Term 3. These are shown during the graduation assembly - also known as FLOP. Musical pieces, both serious and funny, were once often performed. In its more recent years, various restrictions were imposed on FLOP, including a ban on the use of cars in videos, and a requirement for videos to not include swearing and nudity (a FLOP 2002 video involved a full length nudity scene). In 2010, FLOP was officially &#x27;cancelled&#x27;, however, in line with Fort Street students&#x27; long history of being a prominent source of progressive activism in Australia, the decision was fiercely contested by student-led protest groups and FLOP continued in its rebellious nature, including during 2021, when due to COVID-19, students were absent from school for most of their final term – when the filming takes place.

==Fort Street community==
===Alumni===
Fort Street alumni, as well as current attendees, are traditionally called &quot;Fortians&quot;. Prominent former students include Australia&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, a Governor-General of Australia, and five justices of the High Court of Australia (including Michael Kirby), the highest number among government schools in Australia and the second highest among all schools in Australia. Fortians have also served as the President of the United Nations General Assembly (Herbert Evatt) and the President of the International Court of Justice (Percy Spender) (in each case, the only Australians to date to hold such positions), justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Federal Court of Australia and other state and federal courts, Premiers of New South Wales, and Chancellors of the University of Sydney, the University of New South Wales and other universities. Among its graduates are also well known celebrities. In 2010, &quot;The Age&quot; reported that Fort Street High School ranked equal fourth among Australian schools based on the number of alumni who had received a top Order of Australia honour.

===Fort Street Foundation===

The Foundation was established by some Fortians of the class of 1949. The Foundation provides a means of raising funds for the school via a separate, incorporated entity. The Foundation administers three trust funds: Library and Building (tax deductible) and the Education Fund.

<text>Josta was a soft drink brand that was produced by PepsiCo and the first energy drink ever introduced by a major US beverage company. It was marketed as a &quot;high-energy drink&quot; with guarana and caffeine.

Josta was introduced in 1995, but PepsiCo pulled the drink from its lineup due to a change in corporate strategy in 1999. Shortly before the beverage was discontinued, an &quot;Association for Josta Saving&quot; was started. A &quot;Save Josta&quot; campaign was also launched by fans of the drink; their website &quot;www.savejosta.org&quot; was defunct for several years but was reactivated in 2011.

A Pepsi, Ireland based company, PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATE SOLUTIONS UNLIMITED COMPANY has registered Josta as a soda and beer trademark in the US as of March 2023. No logo is yet shown.

==Advertising==
Josta used the slogan, &quot;better do the good stuff now.&quot; In a commercial for Josta, an old man speaks to a younger man; the older man tells the younger man about his life as a youth, and how he wished he had more fun.

==Popular culture==
A Josta drink appears in the 2021 Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot;.

An advertising poster for Josta appears in Madison Square Garden in the 1998 film Godzilla.

<doc id="846570" wikidata="Q735138" url="?curid=846570" title="Kėdainiai">
<text>Kėdainiai () is one of the oldest cities in Lithuania. It is located north of Lithuania&#x27;s second largest city Kaunas on the banks of the Nevėžis River. Kėdainiai were first mentioned in the 1372 Livonian Chronicle of Hermann de Wartberge, its population was 23,051. The Kėdainiai Old Town dates to the 17th century and many of its historical buildings were preserved.

The town is the administrative centre of the Kėdainiai District Municipality. The geographical centre of the Lithuania is in the nearby village of Ruoščiai in the eldership of Dotnuva.

In a ring of five miles, the St Jurgis church is surrounded by smaller villages – Lančiūnava, , Labūnava, Josvainiai, Dotnuva, Kalnaberžė.

==Names==
The city has been known by other names: &quot;Kiejdany&quot; in Polish, &quot;Keidan&quot; (קיידאן) in Yiddish, and &quot;Kedahnen&quot; in German. Kėdainiai other alternate forms include Kidan, Kaidan, Keidany, Keydan, Kiedamjzeÿ (&quot;j&quot; /e/), Kuidany, and Kidainiai.

==History==

The area was the site of several battles during &quot;The Deluge&quot;, the 17th century war between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden. In 1655 a short-lived treaty with Sweden, the Union of Kėdainiai, was signed by two members of Radziwiłł family in their Kėdainiai castle. While little remains of the Radziwiłł castle, the crypt of the Calvinist church (1631) houses the family mausoleum, including the tombs of Krzysztof Radziwiłł and his son Janusz.

Scottish Protestants arrived in the late 16th and 17th centuries, encouraged by the conversion of Anna Radziwill; the community exerted considerable influence in the city and persisted until the mid-19th century. The grouping of the buildings around the town square still include the imposing homes of merchants known as the &quot;Scottish Houses&quot;. These include; the George Anderson House, the John Arnot House, the George Bennet House, the James Gray House, the Steel Property, and the surviving basement of the Alexander Gordon house.

A local custom called on all visitors to bring a stone to be used in the town&#x27;s construction.

The 1st Lithuanian National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in the town in 1790.

===World War II===

In 1940, the town was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union. During Operation Barbarossa, Kėdainiai was occupied by the German Army in the summer of 1941. On August 28, 1941, the entire Jewish community of Kėdainiai, a community which had inhabited the area for 500 years, were killed under the direction of German Special Police Battalions, with the aid of the local Lithuanian population. The Jewish population prior to the Holocaust was 3000.

===Soviet occupation===

During the Cold War, it was home to Kėdainiai air base, a major Soviet military airlift facility.

For many years, Kėdainiai was known for its chemical and food processing industries. The Kėdainiai chemical plant, Lifosa, began operations in January 1963. Publicized as a milestone in the industrialization of Lithuania, it emitted significant quantities of sulfuric acid and was the subject of ecological protests in the 1980s.

<doc id="846583" wikidata="Q286978" url="?curid=846583" title="Muscles of mastication">
<text>The four classical muscles of mastication elevate the mandible (closing the jaw) and move it forward/backward and laterally, facilitating biting and chewing. Other muscles are responsible for opening the jaw, namely the geniohyoid, mylohyoid, and digastric muscles (the lateral pterygoid may play a role).

==Structure==
The muscles are:
* The masseter (composed of the superficial and deep head)
* The temporalis (the sphenomandibularis is considered a part of the temporalis by some sources, and a distinct muscle by others)
* The medial pterygoid
* The lateral pterygoid

In humans, the mandible, or lower jaw, is connected to the temporal bone of the skull via the temporomandibular joint. This is an extremely complex joint which permits movement in all planes. The muscles of mastication originate on the skull and insert into the mandible, thereby allowing for jaw movements during contraction.

Each of these primary muscles of mastication is paired, with each side of the mandible possessing one of the four.

===Innervation===
Unlike most of the other facial muscles, which are innervated by the facial nerve (or CN VII), the muscles of mastication are innervated by the trigeminal nerve (or CN V). More specifically, they are innervated by the mandibular branch, or V3. The mandibular nerve is both sensory and motor.

===Development===
Embryologically, the muscles of mastication are all derived from the first pharyngeal arch.

The muscles of facial expression, on the other hand, are derived from the second pharyngeal arch.

==Function==
The mandible is the only bone that moves during mastication and other activities, such as talking.

While these four muscles are the primary participants in mastication, other muscles help with the process, such as those of the tongue and the cheeks.
==Clinical significance==
* Temporomandibular joint disorder
* Bruxism

<doc id="846590" wikidata="Q6935107" url="?curid=846590" title="Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination">
<text>The Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) is a 120-minute, 60-question, multiple-choice examination designed to measure the knowledge and understanding of established standards related to a lawyer&#x27;s professional conduct. It was developed by the National Conference of Bar Examiners and was first administered in 1980.

It is a prerequisite or corequisite to the bar examination for admission as an attorney at law in 49 of the 50 states of the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Republic of Palau. Of the 56 jurisdictions within the United States, only Puerto Rico, and Wisconsin do not use the MPRE. However, these jurisdictions still incorporate local professional responsibility rules in their respective bar examinations. Connecticut and New Jersey waive the MPRE requirement for bar candidates who have earned a grade of &quot;C&quot; and &quot;C−&quot;, respectively, or better in a law school course in professional responsibility.

==Structure==
As of the October 2012 administration, the test consists of 60 substantive questions. Only 50 are scored; the other 10 (randomly scattered throughout the exam) are used for experimental purposes. The raw score is converted to a &quot;scaled score&quot; based on the measured difficulty of the version of the test taken; the scaled score is used to determine passing scores. Scaled scores range between 50 and 150, with a median very close to 100.

The questions are based on the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, as well as controlling constitutional decisions and generally accepted principles established in leading federal and state cases and in procedural and evidentiary rules (courtesy American Bar Association website and National Conference of Bar Examiners MPRE website). State rules and laws which may or may not differ from the ABA rules are not tested. California uses the MPRE even though it is the only jurisdiction that has not adopted either of the two sets of professional responsibility rules proposed by the American Bar Association – and California rules differ from the ABA rules in many ways. Despite California being the only state to not adopt the ABA&#x27;s Model Rules of Professional Conduct or Judicial Conduct, it is one of the two states with the highest score requirement in the country.

The MPRE differs from the remainder of the bar examination in two ways:

* Virtually all states allow bar exam candidates to take the MPRE prior to graduation from law school, as opposed to the bar examination itself which, in the great majority of states, may only be taken after receipt of a J.D. or L.L.M. from an ABA-accredited law school. 
* A bar exam candidate&#x27;s MPRE score is accepted in every jurisdiction that requires it, unlike the other components of the bar examination.

==Passing score==
The passing score varies between jurisdictions. The lowest score accepted by any jurisdiction is 75 (several). The highest required by any state is 86 (Utah and California).

All states have a window either preceding or surrounding the bar exam outside of which MPRE scores are not recognized.

<doc id="846592" wikidata="Q7757984" url="?curid=846592" title="The Powers That Be (TV series)">
<text>The Powers That Be is an American television sitcom that was broadcast on NBC, premiering on March 7, 1992. It was created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, with Norman Lear as executive producer. It aired for two seasons, with 21 episodes filmed, with 16 of them airing on the network, with its final episode being broadcast on January 2, 1993. During the week of January 18-22, 1993, USA Network aired the remaining 5 episodes that never aired on NBC.

==Premise==
At the center of the series is U.S. Senator William Powers, a parody of the political establishment in Washington, D.C. Margaret, the senator&#x27;s status-hungry wife, treats Charlotte, their maid, with comedic disdain. Caitlyn, the senator&#x27;s daughter, has an eating disorder and is married to Representative Theodore Van Horne, who is suicidal; their son, Pierce, is mature beyond his years from having to care for his unbalanced parents. Sophie Lipkin, the senator&#x27;s illegitimate daughter, is a loud, crass New Jerseyan who surprises the family when she moves to Washington and begins to bond with her father. The senator&#x27;s staff includes an intelligent and beautiful aide, Jordan Miller — who is also Powers&#x27; mistress — and the feckless aide Bradley Grist.

== Cast ==
* John Forsythe as William Powers, the senior United States senator from an unnamed New England state. He is a liberal Democrat. Powers is basically a good man who wishes to do the best for his constituents and is kind to his unfortunate maid Charlotte, son-in-law Theodore, and grandson Pierce. However, he is also something of a ladies&#x27; man, having an affair with his aide Jordan.
* Holland Taylor as Margaret Powers, William&#x27;s wife. She is a status-seeking &quot;superbitch&quot; – her only interest is in what others think (when Pierce hacks into his school computer, she says that&#x27;s fine, but when it is revealed he got caught, she is furious). She ingratiates herself with Hillary Clinton in order to have her husband made Ambassador to Britain, although this only results in her giving people food poisoning. Margaret strongly dislikes Bill&#x27;s daughter Sophie, but pleads with her not to move out their home, as then Bill&#x27;s mother would have to stay with them. She is always trying to get one up on her friend, Mimzie. Nancy Reagan once gave Margaret a pistol as a gift.
* Eve Gordon as Jordan Miller, Bill Powers&#x27; chief of staff and mistress. She is beautiful, confident and savvy and is keen to promote her boss&#x27;s career. She has an Electra complex about the Senator, calling him &quot;Daddy&quot;.
* Peter MacNicol as Bradley Grist, Powers&#x27; press secretary. Bradley is a parody of political aides. He is willing to do anything to make his boss look good; for example, when Powers is accidentally shot, Bradley&#x27;s first thought is as to how it can be spun. He is generally unlucky in his flirtations; however, in one episode he does accidentally marry General Gurdy Walker, his mother&#x27;s best friend, who &quot;hit Schwarzkopf during Desert Storm&quot;.
* Valerie Mahaffey as Caitlyn Van Horne, Bill and Margaret&#x27;s daughter. Caitlyn is very unhappy in her marriage and begins an affair with Joe Bowman, her father&#x27;s election opponent. Not very bright, and very shallow, Caitlyn is nevertheless quite a sweet-natured woman.
* David Hyde Pierce as Theodore Van Horne, Caitlyn&#x27;s husband. Theodore was first elected to Congress in 1987, but made his maiden speech in 1993; it was the shortest speech ever made in the House. He is incredibly shy and often suicidal, but he is friends with his son Pierce.
* Elizabeth Berridge as Charlotte, Bill and Margaret&#x27;s maid. Charlotte is very deferential and quiet. However, she falls in love with Theodore. Margaret abuses her, and she does leave in one episode.
* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Pierce Van Horne, Caitlyn and Theodore&#x27;s son, who is more clever than his parents, and manages to hack into his school&#x27;s computer.
* Robin Bartlett as Sophie Lipkin, Bill&#x27;s illegitimate daughter from a liaison in Korea. She was brought up by a Jewish mother in New Jersey. She lived with a man called Larry but left him because of his inconsiderate behaviour. Margaret and Caitlyn avidly dislike Sophie as she is loud and irrepressible- but ironically, she is a far smoother political operator than the two Establishment insiders. Sophie works in Bill&#x27;s office.

===Legacy===
Although the program was short lived, several of the principals subsequently became involved in long-running and popular sitcoms created after the show&#x27;s demise. Series creators Crane and Kauffman went on to develop &quot;Friends&quot;, which lasted 10 years. Among the actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt took a role in &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, Robin Bartlett played a recurring part on &quot;Mad About You&quot;, Peter MacNicol would soon reach fame with a similar eccentric character, lawyer John Cage, in FOX&#x27;s &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, and David Hyde Pierce was chosen for his role as Niles Crane in the series &quot;Frasier&quot; partly on the basis of his work in this program. Holland Taylor had a high-profile recurring role on the CBS sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. The series also featured John Forsythe in what became his last major starring role on television.

In a 2021 interview, Taylor mentioned the show, saying &quot;I did this fantastic show for Norman Lear called &quot;Powers That Be&quot;. The network didn’t really understand what they had on their hands, and it did not have a long life, much to everyone’s sorrow. It was a wonderful satire.&quot;

<doc id="846593" wikidata="Q112685" url="?curid=846593" title="Tokoroa">
<text>Tokoroa is the fourth-largest town in the Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand and largest settlement in the South Waikato District. Located 30 km southwest of Rotorua and 20 km south of Putāruru, close to the foot of the Mamaku Ranges, it is midway between Taupō and Hamilton on State Highway 1.

==History and culture==
===Early history===

Tokoroa was the name of a chief of the Ngāti Kahupungapunga, who was slain by Raukawa during the siege of Pōhaturoa, a volcanic plug adjacent to Ātiamuri, 27 km south of Tokoroa. This battle took place around 1600 as the Ngāti Raukawa moved into the southern Waikato. The name &quot;Tokoroa&quot; first appeared on the early maps of the 1860s, although this was for an area 50 km north east of today&#x27;s Tokoroa.

===Foundations, growth and decline===

Tokoroa is one of the most recent towns in New Zealand. The township was established (circa) 1917 by the Matarawa Land Company as a potential farming area; a few families had already settled in the area after 1910, and a school with 9 pupils was founded in 1915 (later to become Tokoroa East School). The land was found to be too poor for raising cattle or sheep due to its predominant pumice soils. However, agricultural science showed the land could actually be made to successfully support dairy cattle. The soil had serious deficiencies causing livestock to suffer from what became known as &quot;bush sickness&quot; (later found to be cobalt deficiency). In the 1930s, the deficiency was addressed, and subsequently, cattle farming became profitable.

Between 1925 and 1935 &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; was first introduced to the district as a commercial tree crop – the trees were found not to be adversely affected by the local soil deficiencies. As the initial crops matured, Tokoroa was then developed as a residential satellite for Kinleith Mill workers (New Zealand Forest Products Limited&#x27;s integrated timber, pulp and paper mill), approximately 8 km south of the township. In 1948, Tokoroa had a population of 1,100. By the early 1970s, however, Tokoroa reached, for a time, a population of over 20,000 – the number necessary to be officially deemed a city. In the 1980s years NZFP (and later, mill-owner Carter Holt Harvey Ltd) began to downscale and restructure operations at Kinleith. Since the late 1980s this ongoing downscaling at Kinleith – and closing of other local industries – resulted in a marked drop in population. Census figures put the 2018 population at approximately 14,300.

===Marae===
Tokoroa has two marae connected to local iwi and hapū:

* Ngātira Marae and Te Tikanga a Tāwhiao meeting house are associated with the Ngāti Raukawa hapū of Ngāti Ahuru and the Waikato Tainui hapū of Ngāti Korokī and Ngāti Raukawa ki Panehākua.
* Ōngāroto Marae and Whaita meeting house are affiliated with the Ngāti Raukawa hapū of Ngāti Whaita.

In October 2020, the Government committed $1,259,392 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Ngātira Marae and 7 other Ngāti Raukawa marae, creating 18 jobs.

==Geography==

===Location===

Surrounding the township are many dairy farms and plantation forests. There are many scenic reserves around the town – the artificial Lake Moananui (formed by damming the Matarawa Stream in 1974/75) lies within a recreational park.

Tokoroa lies in the centre of a triangle made up of the tourism destinations of Rotorua, Waitomo and Taupō. There are also about 45 recreational lakes within less than an hour&#x27;s drive of Tokoroa.

===Township===

As well as the central business district, the township is made up of many subdivisions, each built in different stages of the Kinleith complex&#x27;s development. These subdivisions are:

*Parkdale
*Paraonui
*Papanui
*Matarawa
*Aotea
*Strathmore
*Amisfield

Many of the street names of the town were named by the first managing director of N.Z. Forest Products Ltd.(builders of the Kinleith mill), Sir David Henry (1888–1963), after places near his hometown of Edinburgh, in Scotland. David Henry Primary School is a key example of him and his namesaking.

In 1995, Fonterra built the southern hemisphere&#x27;s largest cheese factory in Lichfield, some 5 km north of the town. Due to increases in relative rates of return, large amounts of previously forested land were converted to farmland in the 2000s and 2010s.

The main agricultural activities of the district are sheep and dairy farming. Forestry is still, however, the primary and most important industry to the district. Timber is milled and processed at Kinleith. Over recent years, the sharp decline in timber processing has seen the majority of raw logs shipped offshore. Most of the Kinleith workers live in Tokoroa, with a small number commuting from other South Waikato towns. Tokoroa is a marketing and servicing centre for agriculture, inline with other associated industries. These other industries include (but are not limited to): the manufacture of cheese (and related dairy products [via Fonterra]), specialised wooden boxing, timber joinery, saw milling, general engineering, and the quarrying of building (masonry) stone.

Although Tokoroa&#x27;s economy primarily tends to revolve around timber and farming, many large retail companies have continued investing in the town – Foodstuffs recently constructed and opened a New World (supermarket) on Tokoroa&#x27;s main street (Bridge Street). Also, Woolworths (a major competitor to Foodstuffs Group) also recently built New Zealand&#x27;s first Countdown (supermarket) featuring bilingual (i.e. including Te Reo-Māori) signage.

==Town facilities and attractions==

Tokoroa has a number of Tourist and visiting attractions, as well as many facilities for local use.
===Talking Poles===
Since 1997, Tokoroa has been &quot;sprouting&quot; Talking Poles, consisting mainly of carvings representing ethnic culture, sports recreation, industry in the town and stories about the town. This one, photographed shortly after its unveiling in 2004, is a chainsaw carving of a deodar cedar which died from natural causes. It is representative of the Greenman in Welsh mythology and was, prior to 2018, located on State Highway 1, immediately adjacent to the town&#x27;s information centre.

By October 2008, 42 Talking Poles were displayed around the town. Tokoroa Talking Poles symposium is convened every two years at the Tokoroa campus of Te Wananga o Aotearoa. The Greenman was carved in 2004 by Mr Andy Hankcock.

As part of the CBD Upgrade project, several of the town&#x27;s Talking Poles were relocated next to where the existing &#x27;Pine Man&#x27; sculpture stands in a central area between State Highway One and Leith Place. In 2018, the Greenman carving was relocated from its site to make way for this new development. Due to substantial rot discovered during this process, the Greenman was not re-installed. As of 2021 council has made arrangements to restore the sculpture.

===Lake Moana-Nui===
Tokoroa&#x27;s man-made Lake Moana-Nui was created in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large earthmoving equipment and a concrete dam wall with a drain valve control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the drain valve was a favourite &#x27;bomb&#x27; spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early extreme sport unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, &#x27;The Lake&#x27; was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as &#x27;Tokoroa Beach&#x27;. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.

In the period following the initial construction of the dam in the late 1970s, the lake began to deteriorate due to low rainfall and poor water flows, which saw lake weed overtake the swimming areas. The lake weed eventually became a drowning hazard that claimed the lives of swimmers over the preceding decade. In this sense, the project was a failure, and Lake Moana-Nui was considered unsafe. In an effort to control the problems, signs were erected banning access to the dam wall, and basic handrailing was put up to prevent public access. The lake was subject to regular draining in an effort to control the weed and to flush out the stale, stagnant water. While this did slightly improve the situation in the short term, people were warned not to swim in it. The lake is undergoing a major cleaning project so that it can be used in the future. To date (as at 25 April 2015), Lake Moana-Nui has been fully drained, refilled, and restored – and has been cleared by the local council for public recreation (as it was in its heyday during the 1970s and 80&#x27;s).

There are picnic tables built around the lakes arc and there are four playgrounds. At the southern end of Lake Moana-Nui are gardens which were planted by a collective of Tokoroa school children.

===Tokoroa Airfield===
Tokoroa has an airfield with an 850m sealed runway. There are no scheduled air services. The site is often used for non-aircraft related reasons.

===Town library===
The current location of Tokoroa&#x27;s library holds many historic memories for the locals – as it was previously the town&#x27;s cinema. It currently holds a library with a full computer suite, over 2,000 books, a reference book section, and children&#x27;s leisure area. It is located in the Tokoroa town centre.

===Tokoroa Hospital===
Tokoroa Hospital provides limited medical services for a population of approximately 22,800 people in the South Waikato District. Currently, the hospital provides 21 beds made up of a 17-bed inpatient ward and a 4-bed maternity ward. There is also a dedicated emergency department with capacity for five patients, and a fully functional theatre suite presently used for minor day surgery. Other facilities include x-ray and laboratory services, a cafe, a helipad for patient transfer, and various allied health services. District and public health nursing, diabetes nursing specialists, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and health social work services are also based the hospital site, which also hosts clinics with various visiting specialists. The hospital site accommodates the Tokoroa Council of Social Services (an umbrella organisation of community services), and since 2014 has also hosted the town&#x27;s GP practices, a pharmacy and several other health services in a modern health campus based at the hospital&#x27;s former Ward 3.

==Culture and sports==
Tokoroa hosts a number of sporting, cultural and music events every year including the Polynesian festival.

===Polynesian Festival===
Tokoroa Polynesian Festival occurs every year during September. Tokoroa&#x27;s local schools and preschools give Samoan, Māori and Cook Islands performances, where you hear the Cook Island drumming and dancing and the Māori performing arts being displayed on the huge stage at the new South Waikato Events Centre, located at The Tokoroa Memorial Sports Ground. The 2009 event hosted NZ artists J.Williams and Erika.

===Sports===
Tokoroa being within the Waikato Province falls under the Waikato ITM Cup provincial catchment and the Chiefs Super Rugby franchise. The South Waikato district&#x27;s netball associations also fall under the catchment for inclusion in the ANZ Championship, Waikato/BOP Magic franchise.

Over many decades, Tokoroa has been a natural base for strong, competitive woodchopping and sawing events. The axe long saw and chainsaw competitions, at the local A&amp;P Shows, over many decades, have always been central to the local, timber and timber works culture of the town. As of 2018 the annual Tokoroa A&amp;P show has been axed due to financial reasons.

===Tokoroa Memorial Sports Ground===

The sports ground is used every weekend and is in use throughout the weekdays. The Memorial Sports Ground includes:

* Eight full netball courts

South Waikato District Council provides local governance services and amenities for Tokoroa, and is where the councils head office is located. Tokoroa is part of the Taupō electorate and has been represented by Louise Upston since 2008.

==Transportation==
===Cycling===
Tokoroa has a number of cycleways which link the town centre with the outlying suburbs. These cycleways consist of a mixture of dedicated cycle lanes and mixed-use cycle/walk ways. There is an extensive cycleway from Browning Street, Tokoroa that leads to Kinleith which provides views of the town and the Kinleith mill.

===State Highways and public roads ===
New Zealand&#x27;s main arterial route, State Highway 1, runs through Tokoroa&#x27;s eastern edge. Tokoroa is also accessible from the south-west via State Highway 32 (via Maraetai Road). Tokoroa is also a non-traffic light controlled zone.

Tokoroa is served by national bus (coachline) services such as Intercity (New Zealand) and Naked Bus, operating on various routes along State Highway 1.

=== Public transport ===
The Tokoroa Urban Connector bus service was established in June 2015, running a circuit route within Tokoroa, in addition to a district wide circuit connecting with Tīrau, Putāruru and Litchfield. Having previously been contracted to Go Bus, in October 2022 services were rebranded under the name South Waikato Urban Connector when Tranzit Coachlines were awarded a contract to run services. Current weekday routes servicing Tokoroa include the 30 Tokoroa Circuit, 31 District Connector and the 32 Tokoroa Connector. The 37 Tokoroa to Taupō services the town twice a week, providing a public transport connection to the town via Mangakino.

===Railway===
The Kinleith Branch line runs through Tokoroa on its route between Waharoa on the East Coast Main Trunk line, and its terminus at the Kinleith Mill to the south of the town. Most freight trains on the line travel between the Kinleith and the Port of Tauranga. The line was rebuilt based on the TTT Railway in 1952, and since then has carried only freight traffic. A container terminal opened in 2015.

====Taupo Totara Timber Company Railway====

In the early 1900s the Taupo Totara Timber Company (TTT) built a railway between its sawmilling centre at Mokai (near Taupō). and Putāruru, where it connected with the NZ Government Railway. The TTT line crossed the Tokoroa Plains, passing through the area that has become the town of Tokoroa.

The TTT railway opened in 1905 as a private carrier, carrying TTT staff and their families, guests,

 freight, and mail between Putāruru and Mokai. From January 29, 1908, the TTT Railway opened its freight and passenger services to the public.

====New Zealand Railways Kinleith Branch====

The NZ Government purchased a section of the TTT Railway, from Putāruru to the &quot;19-Mile Peg&quot;, near the present-day location of the Kinleith Paper Mill. From Tuesday, 10 June 1947, the NZ Government took over the operation of this part of the TTT line.

This section was reconstructed under a NZ Government scheme for development of the Waikato River basin and surrounding areas. The project was completed on 6 October 1952.

The main cargo, from Kinleith, used to include: raw and processed pulp; paper products; plywood, timber, and raw logs. With restructuring having taken its toll on processing at Kinleith, however, the predominant cargo is now raw and ring-barked logs; logs are destined for export to timber, pulp, and paper processing plants worldwide. 46 trains a week run on the branch.

<doc id="846599" wikidata="Q1423512" url="?curid=846599" title="Music On A Long Thin Wire">
<text>″&quot;Music on a Long Thin Wire&quot; is a musical piece by Alvin Lucier conceived in 1977.

In his own words (1992): &quot;Music on a Long Thin Wire&quot; is constructed as follows: the wire is extended across a large room, clamped to tables at both ends. The ends of the wire are connected to the loudspeaker terminals of a power amplifier placed under one of the tables. A sine wave oscillator is connected to the amplifier. A magnet straddles the wire at one end. Wooden bridges are inserted under the wire at both ends to which contact microphones are embedded, routed to a stereo sound system. The microphones pick up the vibrations that the wire imparts to the bridges and are sent through the playback system. By varying the frequency and loudness of the oscillator, a rich variety of slides, frequency shifts, audible beats and other sonic phenomena may be produced.&quot;

However, Lucier admits a &quot;long&quot; thin wire was at first only used to avoid the look of a laboratory experiment in favour of a more sculptural appearance; a short thin wire would have worked as well. He discovered that the best way to produce variation in the sonic phenomena was to pick a setting and leave the setup alone. He praised David Rosenboom for his ability to pick interesting settings.

It has been exhibited:
*1979, Winrock Shopping Center, Albuquerque, and broadcast uninterrupted on KUNM (FM) for five days and nights
*1980, Landmark Center, Saint Paul
*1988, Gallery of the Center for the Arts at Wesleyan, Middletown, CT
*2011, Tom Duff was duplicating the 1979 performance from Albuquerque on sfSoundRadio, an internet radio station from the San Francisco bay area, again broadcasting uninterrupted for five days (April 8–12).

<doc id="846605" wikidata="Q1320597" url="?curid=846605" title="Laird Hamilton">
<text>Laird John Hamilton (né Zerfas; born March 2, 1964) is an American big-wave surfer, co-inventor of tow-in surfing, and an occasional fashion and action-sports model and actor. He is married to Gabrielle Reece, a former professional volleyball player, television personality, and model.

==Early life==
Laird was born Laird John Zerfas in San Francisco on March 2, 1964, in an experimental salt-water sphere at UCSF Medical Center designed to ease the mother&#x27;s labor. His biological father, L. G. Zerfas, immigrated from Greece to California and left the family before his first birthday. While he was an infant, Laird and his mother, Joann (née Zyirek), moved to Hawaii. In 1967, while still a young boy living on Oahu, Laird met with 1960s surfer William Stuart &quot;Bill&quot; Hamilton, a bachelor at the time, on Pūpūkea beach on the North Shore. Bill Hamilton was a surfboard shaper and glasser on Oahu in the 1960s and 1970s and owned a small business handmaking custom, high-performance surfboards for the Oahu North Shore big wave riders of the era. The two became immediate companions. The young Laird invited Bill Hamilton home to meet his mother. Bill Hamilton married Laird&#x27;s then-single mother, becoming Laird&#x27;s adoptive father.

The family later moved to a remote valley on Kauai island. Joann and Bill had a second son, Lyon, Laird&#x27;s half-brother, who also became a surfer. Laird&#x27;s mother died of a brain aneurysm in 1997.

Hamilton had a reputation for an aggressive demeanor around others of his age. The role of the outsider profoundly affected Laird through to his teen years and early adult life. He became used to this role and was uncomfortable being in the center of anything. He was also known for his physical and mental toughness.

===Modeling===
When he was 16, Hamilton left the eleventh grade at Kapaa High School to pursue a modeling career and work in construction. At 17, Hamilton was discovered on a beach in Kauai by a photographer from the Italian &quot;Men&#x27;s Vogue&quot; magazine &quot;L&#x27;Uomo Vogue&quot; which landed him a modeling contract and later a 1983 photo shoot with the actress Brooke Shields. Hamilton continued to do occasional men&#x27;s action sportswear print modeling.

In 2008 Hamilton announced his own &quot;Wonderwall&quot; line of affordable clothing, sold through Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s until that retailer shut down at the end of January 2009.
He has had long-time sponsorship from the French beachwear company Oxbow surfwear.

==Surfing career==

===1980s===

By the age of 17, Hamilton had become an accomplished surfer and could have left modeling to pursue a career on surfing&#x27;s World Championship Tour. However, competitive surfing and contests never appealed to Hamilton, who had watched his father Bill endure the competitive surfing contest politics and the random luck of the waves in organized championship surfing events. Bill Hamilton regarded surfing more as a work of art, rather than based chiefly on wave-by-wave ride performance scored by judges.

In the 1987 movie &quot;North Shore&quot;, Hamilton played the violent, antagonistic role of &quot;Lance Burkhart&quot;.
Despite further success in modeling during the 1980s, Hamilton, with his professional surfing upbringing, always intended a life of surfing, but continued to reject the professional contest circuit.

In 1989 Laird featured in windsurfing movie &quot;Moving Target&quot; alongside Fred Haywood.

===1990s===
An early attempt at media recognition was his quest to be the first surfer to complete a 360 degree loop while strapped to his board. The attempt was chronicled in Greg Stump&#x27;s 1990 ski film, &quot;Groove - Requiem in the key of Ski&quot;. In the early 1990s, Hamilton, along with a small group of friends collectively dubbed the &quot;Strapped Crew&quot; because their feet were strapped to their boards, pushed the boundaries of surfing at Jaws surf break off the north central coast of Maui. The Strapped Crew tackled bigger waves featuring stunts. Stunts included: launching jumps on sailboards, then mating the boards to paragliders to experiment with some of the earliest kiteboards.

In late 1992, Hamilton with two of his close friends, big wave riders Darrick Doerner and Buzzy Kerbox (also an occasional men&#x27;s fashion model; Hamilton and Kerbox later lost their friendship over a property disagreement), started using inflatable boats to tow one another into waves which were too big to catch under paddle power alone. This innovation is chronicled in the documentary film, &quot;Riding Giants&quot;. The technique would later be modified to use personal water craft and become a popular innovation. Tow-in surfing, as it became known, pushed the confinements and possibilities of big wave surfing to a new level. Although met with mixed reactions from the surfing community, some of whom felt that it was cheating and polluting, Hamilton explained that tow-in surfing was the only way to catch the monstrous sized waves. Using tow-in surfing methods, Hamilton learned how to survive waves and carving arcs across walls of water.

Hamilton appeared as Kevin Costner&#x27;s stunt double during the 1995 filming of &quot;Waterworld&quot;. Reportedly, Hamilton was nearly lost at sea when his Kawasaki Jet Ski ran out of fuel during a squall. He then drifted for hours before being rescued by Coast Guard off the Island of Maui. Hamilton commuted daily to the enclosed set between Maui and the Big Island by jet ski.

Hamilton met women&#x27;s professional volleyball player and New York fashion model Gabrielle Reece in Maui in 1995 after a television interview by Reece, who was hosting the show &#x27;The Extremists&#x27;. People magazine named him one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World the following year, and he pushed for and took from his future wife the correspondent position for the syndicated cable series &#x27;The Extremists&#x27;. They later married on November 30, 1997. In 1989 Reece had been named by &quot;Elle&quot; magazine as one of the Five Most Beautiful Women in the World.

By the late 1990s, Hamilton continued with windsurfing, waterskiing and kitesurfing. In 1996 Hamilton and Manu Bertin were instrumental in demonstrating and popularizing kitesurfing off the Hawaiian coast of Maui.
In 1999 Hamilton sailed his windsurfer between the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Kauai, some fifty miles away, in just under six hours.

Hamilton has also experimented with the foilboard, an innovative surfboard which incorporates hydrofoil technology allowing a higher degree of precision and effectiveness of aerial techniques within the water. He has become a proponent of Stand up paddle surfing, an ancient Hawaiian technique that requires a longboard and a long-handled paddle, as well as considerable skill, strength and agility. Purist surfers have blasted him for this, but Hamilton calls it a return to the traditional Hawaiian way of surfing, as practiced by King Kamehameha I and his queen Kaahumanu almost three hundred years ago.

===Ride at Teahupoo Reef===

Hamilton&#x27;s drop into Tahiti&#x27;s Teahupoo break on the morning of August 17, 2000 firmly established him in the recorded history of surfing.
Teahupoo is a particularly hazardous shallow-water reef break on the southeast coast of the Pacific Island of Tahiti.

On that day, with a larger than normal ocean swell, Darrick Doerner piloted the watercraft, towing Hamilton. Pulling in and releasing the tow rope, Hamilton drove down into the well of the wave&#x27;s enormous tunnel vortex, in full view of boat-based photographers&#x27; and videographers&#x27; cameras. With his signature artistic flair, Hamilton continued deeply carving water, emerging back over the wave&#x27;s shoulder. A still photograph of him riding the wave made the cover of &quot;Surfer&quot; magazine, with the caption: &quot;oh my god...&quot; The wave became known as &quot;the heaviest ever ridden&quot;.

In the filmed coverage of this event in the motion picture &quot;Riding Giants&quot;, Doerner said &quot;I towed him onto this wave. And it was to the point where I almost said &#x27;Don&#x27;t let go of the rope,&#x27; and when I looked back he was gone.&quot;

Laird said: “That was all about faith. Believing I could. That wave in Teahupo’o was a wave we didn’t know existed. We hadn’t seen waves like that. In my world, when I was a kid, I went to every surf movie, I knew all of the best surfers in the world, I was in the middle of all it… but a wave like that did not exist, and the ability to ride that wave in any form didn’t exist either.&quot;

Hamilton is regarded by surfing historians as the &quot;all time best of the best&quot; at big wave surfing, regularly surfing swells of 35 feet (11 m) tall, and moving at speeds in excess of an hour and successfully riding other waves of up to high, at up to 50 mph (80 km/h).
Hamilton prefers tow-in surfing the giant waves of Peahi reef (known as the Jaws surf break) on the north central shore of the Island of Maui.

===2000s===
On December 3, 2007, when Brett Lickle was towing Hamilton into a wave on the Maui north shore, called &quot;Egypt&quot;, a wave knocked Lickle from the watercraft.
The fin sliced Lickle, causing him to bleed into the sea, which he feared would attract sharks. Hamilton swam to recover the watercraft, found Lickle in the surf, fashioned his swimsuit into a cloth tourniquet, and applied it to Lickle to save his life. Hamilton then piloted the watercraft back to a landing, where Lickle was immediately taken to a hospital for treatment. Brett recalled that day for Chris Dixon that Brett towed Laird into a wave that was in his opinion &quot;better than 10 stories tall&quot; and the biggest wave ever ridden. That means over 100 feet tall. It was not photographed and therefore not officially recognized by the XXL judges.

In February 2008 Hamilton joined the board of directors of H2O Audio, a watersports music company in San Diego. He had used H2O Audio products on many of his long distance paddling endeavors before joining the company.
Later in 2008 he published a book which he describes as not an autobiography, but discussing his philosophy of life.

On August 27, 2014, Hamilton was in the news again for riding waves and boards which few others dared. Hurricane Marie caused Southern California to be hit with a swell of extreme size—triple over head (and larger) waves could be found from San Diego to Los Angeles, including Laird&#x27;s home break at Malibu. Late in the day, on a stand-up paddle board, Hamilton dropped into one of the largest waves of the day and proceeded to &quot;shoot&quot; the Malibu beach pier at an extremely high speed.
Despite being one of the best known surfers since the time of Duke Kahanamoku, the matured Hamilton avoids self-promotion. He serves as an ambassador of surfing and watersports and occasional lifeguard to other tow-in surfers.

Hamilton is also an environmental activist. He joined a protest in Malibu against a proposed plant, which would affect the quality of the local waters. Other celebrities attended the event, including Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry and Ted Danson.

In April 2018, Laird made worldwide news for voluntarily rescuing people around Kauai, Hawaii from devastating, record-breaking storms that were causing flooding. Laird, who lives on the island and used his own boat, has assisted many families in evacuating the island from the flooding, and is being hailed a hero.

Laird Hamilton is a co-founder and co-creator of XPT Life or Extreme Performance Training, along with his wife, Gabrielle Reece.

Laird Hamilton, along with Paul Hodge and Gabrielle Reece, co-founded Laird Superfood in 2015. In September 2020 the company went public on the NYSE under the id LSF.

==Personal life==
Hamilton has a daughter with his first wife, big-wave surfer and clothing designer Maria Souza.

Hamilton married volleyball player and fashion model Gabrielle Reece in 1997. They have two daughters together. Hamilton and his family split their time between residences in Kauai, Hawaii, and Malibu, California. Hamilton and Reece have been described as part of the &quot;Malibu Mob&quot;, a celebrity group in the same vein as the Brat Pack. Other Malibu Mob members include Chris Chelios, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, John C. McGinley, Tony Danza, Justin Long, Ed O&#x27;Neill, John McEnroe, and formerly Max Wright.

==Other media appearances==
Hamilton was featured in American Express credit card television commercials; an early 2000s commercial in the series &quot;Hi, you probably wouldn&#x27;t recognize my name . . . &quot; and more recently in the American Express &quot;My life, my card&quot; commercial series.

In 2007, Hamilton, along with his wife Gabrielle Reece, appeared in the ABC reality television series &quot;Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race&quot;, featuring a dozen celebrities in a stock car racing competition. In the first round of competition, Hamilton matched up against tennis star Serena Williams and former NFL quarterback John Elway. Hamilton was eliminated in episode 5.

He appeared in the Sundance Channel television show &quot;Iconoclasts&quot; with Eddie Vedder from the popular American rock band Pearl Jam.

Footage of Hamilton is used on the video for &quot;Dayvan Cowboy&quot; from Boards of Canada. In 2003, he was featured in Dana Brown&#x27;s surf documentary &quot;Step Into Liquid&quot;. On January 13, 2010, Hamilton and wife Reece appeared as themselves on the episode &quot;Gary Feels Tom Slipping Away&quot; of the CBS television series &quot;Gary Unmarried&quot;.

He was a special guest star as himself in the animated television show &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;. He was also interviewed as part of the Australian documentary &quot;Bra Boys: Blood is Thicker than Water&quot;.

Hamilton had a minor role as Troy in &quot;The Descendants&quot;.

Hamilton also was the Celebrity on the Volvo Ocean Race Boat Puma Powered by Berg. He did a spectacular exit off the boat by diving off it as it was at full speed.

In February 2012, Hamilton was featured in &quot;Oprah Winfrey Network&quot; (OWN)&#x27;s production of &quot;Oprah Presents Master Class&quot;, in which he shared his life and life philosophies with the audience.

<text>Melbourne tram route 6 is operated by Yarra Trams on the Melbourne tram network from Moreland to Glen Iris. The route is operated out of Brunswick and Malvern depots with Z, B and D class trams.

==History==
Route 6 was allocated to the line between Glen Iris and City (Swanston Street) on 21 November 1929, the same day that numbers were allocated to the rest of the Swanston Street trams. Trams traditionally terminated at the Victoria Street terminus, but following an accident in 1991, trams instead terminated at the Queensberry Street crossover. Due to congestion during peak hours at the crossover, some trams continued north to Melbourne University. Finally on 17 January 1996, a permanent shunt was built at Melbourne University. From then on, route 6 trams were altered run full-time to Melbourne University.

The origins of route 6 lie in separate tram lines. The section of track between Queensberry Street (Stop 4) and High Street (Stop 27) is the oldest section of this route, dating back to the Brighton Road cable tram which opened on 11 October 1888 by the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company. This cable tram line was electrified in stages by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board. The section between Domain Interchange (Stop 20) and High Street was electrified on 27 December 1925. The section between Queensberry Street and City Road (near Stop 14) was electrified on the same day. The line between City Road and Domain Interchange was electrified on 24 January 1926.

The section between Charles Street (near Stop 30) and Tooranga Road (Stop 48) was one of the original lines constructed by the Prahran &amp; Malvern Tramways Trust (PMTT), which opened on 30 May 1910. This line was extended west to Punt Road on 14 March 1911 and again, to St Kilda Road on 14 September 1912, connecting with the St Kilda Road cable tram to the city. The PMTT extended the line again on 25 March 1914, this time east, to its current terminus at Malvern Road. Meanwhile, the Melbourne, Brunswick &amp; Coburg Tramways Trust constructed the section of route 6 north of Queensberry Street towards Moreland. This section opened on 31 October 1916.

On 1 May 2017, as part of works associated with the closure of Domain Interchange and construction of Anzac railway station, route 6 was extended from Melbourne University to Moreland to partly replace route 8.

==Route==
Route 6 operates from Brunswick tram depot travelling east along Moreland Road before turning south along Holmes Street in Brunswick East. It continues south to Albion Street where it doglegs into Lygon Street, continuing south through Carlton North and Carlton, turning west into Elgin Street and south into Swanston Street at Melbourne University. It proceeds south via Melbourne Central station and Flinders Street stations. After crossing the Yarra River it continues south along St Kilda Road. It turns east into High Street, traversing via Prahran, Windsor, Armadale and Malvern to its terminus at Malvern Road, Glen Iris.

==Operation==
Route 6 is operated out of Brunswick and Malvern depots with Z, B, D1 and D2 class trams. On 30 November 2002, the first D class trams entered service on the route.

<doc id="846623" wikidata="Q1043076" url="?curid=846623" title="XML schema">
<text>An XML schema is a description of a type of XML document, typically expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents of that type, above and beyond the basic syntactical constraints imposed by XML itself. These constraints are generally expressed using some combination of grammatical rules governing the order of elements, Boolean predicates that the content must satisfy, data types governing the content of elements and attributes, and more specialized rules such as uniqueness and referential integrity constraints.

There are languages developed specifically to express XML schemas. The document type definition (DTD) language, which is native to the XML specification, is a schema language that is of relatively limited capability, but that also has other uses in XML aside from the expression of schemas. Two more expressive XML schema languages in widespread use are XML Schema (with a capital &quot;S&quot;) and RELAX NG.

The mechanism for associating an XML document with a schema varies according to the schema language. The association may be achieved via markup within the XML document itself, or via some external means.

The XML Schema Definition is commonly referred to as XSD.

== Validation ==
The process of checking to see if a XML document conforms to a schema is called validation, which is separate from XML&#x27;s core concept of syntactic well-formedness. All XML documents must be well-formed, but it is not required that a document be valid unless the XML parser is &quot;validating&quot;, in which case the document is also checked for conformance with its associated schema. DTD-validating parsers are most common, but some support XML Schema or RELAX NG as well.

Validation of an instance document against a schema can be regarded as a conceptually separate operation from XML parsing. In practice, however, many schema validators are integrated with an XML parser.

==Languages==
There are several different languages available for specifying an XML schema. Each language has its strengths and weaknesses.

The primary purpose of a schema language is to specify what the structure of an XML document can be. This means which elements can reside in which other elements, which attributes are and are not legal to have on a particular element, and so forth. A schema is analogous to a grammar for a language; a schema defines what the vocabulary for the language may be and what a valid &quot;sentence&quot; is.

There are historic and current XML schema languages:
The main ones (see also the ISO 19757&#x27;s endorsed languages) are described below.

Though there are a number of schema languages available, the primary three languages are Document Type Definitions, W3C XML Schema, and RELAX NG. Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages.

=== Document Type Definitions ===
==== Tool support ====

DTDs are perhaps the most widely supported schema language for XML. Because DTDs are one of the earliest schema languages for XML, defined before XML even had namespace support, they are widely supported. Internal DTDs are often supported in XML processors; external DTDs are less often supported, but only slightly. Most large XML parsers, ones that support multiple XML technologies, will provide support for DTDs as well.

=== W3C XML Schema ===
==== Advantages over DTDs ====

Features available in XSD that are missing from DTDs include:

* Names of elements and attributes are namespace-aware
* Constraints (&quot;simple types&quot;) can be defined for the textual content of elements and attributes, for example to specify that they are numeric or contain dates. A wide repertoire of simple types are provided as standard, and additional user-defined types can be derived from these, for example by specifying ranges of values, regular expressions, or by enumerating the permitted values.
* Facilities for defining uniqueness constraints and referential integrity are more powerful: unlike the ID and IDREF constraints in DTDs, they can be scoped to any part of a document, can be of any data type, can apply to element as well as attribute content, and can be multi-part (for example the combination of first name and last name must be unique).
* Many requirements that are traditionally handled using parameter entities in DTDs have explicit support in XSD: examples include substitution groups, which allow a single name (such as &quot;block&quot; or &quot;inline&quot;) to refer to a whole class of elements; complex types, which allow the same content model to be shared (or adapted by restriction or extension) by multiple elements; and model groups and attribute groups, which allow common parts of component models to be defined in one place and reused.
* XSD 1.1 adds the ability to define arbitrary assertions (using XPath expressions) as constraints on element content.

XSD schemas are conventionally written as XML documents, so familiar editing and transformation tools can be used.

As well as validation, XSD allows XML instances to be annotated with type information (the Post-Schema-Validation Infoset (PSVI)) which is designed to make manipulation of the XML instance easier in application programs. This may be by mapping the XSD-defined types to types in a programming language such as Java (&quot;data binding&quot;) or by enriching the type system of XML processing languages such as XSLT and XQuery (known as &quot;schema-awareness&quot;).

==== Commonality with RELAX NG ====
RELAX NG and W3C XML Schema allow for similar mechanisms of specificity. Both allow for a degree of modularity in their languages, including, for example, splitting the schema into multiple files. And both of them are, or can be, defined in an XML language.

==== Advantages over RELAX NG ====

RELAX NG does not have any analog to PSVI. Unlike W3C XML Schema, RELAX NG was designed so that validation and augmentation (adding type information and default values) are separate.

W3C XML Schema has a formal mechanism for attaching a schema to an XML document, while RELAX NG intentionally avoids such mechanisms for security and interoperability reasons.

RELAX NG has no ability to apply default attribute data to an element&#x27;s list of attributes (i.e., changing the XML info set), while W3C XML Schema does. Again, this design is intentional and is to separate validation and augmentation.

W3C XML Schema has a rich &quot;simple type&quot; system built-in (xs:number, xs:date, etc., plus derivation of custom types), while RELAX NG has an extremely simplistic one because it is meant to use type libraries developed independently of RELAX NG, rather than grow its own. This is seen by some as a disadvantage. In practice it is common for a RELAX NG schema to use the predefined &quot;simple types&quot; and &quot;restrictions&quot; (pattern, maxLength, etc.) of W3C XML Schema.

In W3C XML Schema a specific number or range of repetitions of patterns can be expressed whereas it is practically not possible to specify at all in RELAX NG (&lt;oneOrMore&gt; or &lt;zeroOrMore&gt;).

==== Disadvantages ====

W3C XML Schema is complex and hard to learn, although that is partially because it tries to do more than mere validation (see PSVI).

Although being written in XML is an advantage, it is also a disadvantage in some ways. The W3C XML Schema language, in particular, can be quite verbose, while a DTD can be terse and relatively easily editable.

Likewise, WXS&#x27;s formal mechanism for associating a document with a schema can pose a potential security problem. For WXS validators that will follow a URI to an arbitrary online location, there is the potential for reading something malicious from the other side of the stream.

W3C XML Schema does not implement most of the DTD ability to provide data elements to a document.

Although W3C XML Schema&#x27;s ability to add default attributes to elements is an advantage, it is a disadvantage in some ways as well. It means that an XML file may not be usable in the absence of its schema, even if the document would validate against that schema. In effect, all users of such an XML document must also implement the W3C XML Schema specification, thus ruling out minimalist or older XML parsers. It can also slow down the processing of the document, as the processor must potentially download and process a second XML file (the schema); however, a schema would normally then be cached, so the cost comes only on the first use.

==== Tool Support ====

WXS support exists in a number of large XML parsing packages. Xerces and the .NET Framework&#x27;s Base Class Library both provide support for WXS validation.

=== RELAX NG ===
RELAX NG provides for most of the advantages that W3C XML Schema does over DTDs.

==== Advantages over W3C XML Schema ====

While the language of RELAX NG can be written in XML, it also has an equivalent form that is much more like a DTD, but with greater specifying power. This form is known as the compact syntax. Tools can easily convert between these forms with no loss of features or even commenting. Even arbitrary elements specified between RELAX NG XML elements can be converted into the compact form.

RELAX NG provides very strong support for unordered content. That is, it allows the schema to state that a sequence of patterns may appear in any order.

RELAX NG also allows for non-deterministic content models. What this means is that RELAX NG allows the specification of a sequence like the following:
&lt;zeroOrMore&gt;
 &lt;ref name=&quot;odd&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;ref name=&quot;even&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/zeroOrMore&gt;
&lt;optional&gt;
 &lt;ref name=&quot;odd&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/optional&gt;
When the validator encounters something that matches the &quot;odd&quot; pattern, it is unknown whether this is the optional last &quot;odd&quot; reference or simply one in the zeroOrMore sequence without looking ahead at the data. RELAX NG allows this kind of specification. W3C XML Schema requires all of its sequences to be fully deterministic, so mechanisms like the above must be either specified in a different way or omitted altogether.

RELAX NG allows attributes to be treated as elements in content models. In particular, this means that one can provide the following:
&lt;element name=&quot;some_element&quot;&gt;
 &lt;choice&gt;
 &lt;attribute name=&quot;has_name&quot;&gt;
 &lt;value&gt;false&lt;/value&gt;
 &lt;/attribute&gt;
 &lt;group&gt;
 &lt;attribute name=&quot;has_name&quot;&gt;
 &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;
 &lt;/attribute&gt;
 &lt;element name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;&lt;text /&gt;&lt;/element&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt;
&lt;/element&gt;
This block states that the element &quot;some_element&quot; must have an attribute named &quot;has_name&quot;. This attribute can only take true or false as values, and if it is true, the first child element of the element must be &quot;name&quot;, which stores text. If &quot;name&quot; did not need to be the first element, then the choice could be wrapped in an &quot;interleave&quot; element along with other elements. The order of the specification of attributes in RELAX NG has no meaning, so this block need not be the first block in the element definition.

W3C XML Schema cannot specify such a dependency between the content of an attribute and child elements.

RELAX NG&#x27;s specification only lists two built-in types (string and token), but it allows for the definition of many more. In theory, the lack of a specific list allows a processor to support data types that are very problem-domain specific.

Most RELAX NG schemas can be algorithmically converted into W3C XML Schemas and even DTDs (except when using RELAX NG features not supported by those languages, as above). The reverse is not true. As such, RELAX NG can be used as a normative version of the schema, and the user can convert it to other forms for tools that do not support RELAX NG.

==== Disadvantages ====

Most of RELAX NG&#x27;s disadvantages are covered under the section on W3C XML Schema&#x27;s advantages over RELAX NG.

Though RELAX NG&#x27;s ability to support user-defined data types is useful, it comes at the disadvantage of only having two data types that the user can rely upon. Which, in theory, means that using a RELAX NG schema across multiple validators requires either providing those user-defined data types to that validator or using only the two basic types. In practice, however, most RELAX NG processors support the W3C XML Schema set of data types.

=== Schematron ===
Schematron is a fairly unusual schema language. Unlike the main three, it defines an XML file&#x27;s syntax as a list of XPath-based rules. If the document passes these rules, then it is valid.

==== Advantages ====

Because of its rule-based nature, Schematron&#x27;s specificity is very strong. It can require that the content of an element be controlled by one of its siblings. It can also request or require that the root element, regardless of what element that happens to be, have specific attributes. It can even specify required relationships between multiple XML files.

==== Disadvantages ====

While Schematron is good at relational constructs, its ability to specify the basic structure of a document, that is, which elements can go where, results in a very verbose schema.

The typical way to solve this is to combine Schematron with RELAX NG or W3C XML Schema. There are several schema processors available for both languages that support this combined form. This allows Schematron rules to specify additional constraints to the structure defined by W3C XML Schema or RELAX NG.

==== Tool Support ====

Schematron&#x27;s reference implementation is actually an XSLT transformation that transforms the Schematron document into an XSLT that validates the XML file. As such, Schematron&#x27;s potential toolset is any XSLT processor, though libxml2 provides an implementation that does not require XSLT. Sun Microsystems&#x27;s Multiple Schema Validator for Java has an add-on that allows it to validate RELAX NG schemas that have embedded Schematron rules.

=== Namespace Routing Language (NRL) ===
This is not technically a schema language. Its sole purpose is to direct parts of documents to individual schemas based on the namespace of the encountered elements. An NRL is merely a list of XML namespaces and a path to a schema that each corresponds to. This allows each schema to be concerned with only its own language definition, and the NRL file routes the schema validator to the correct schema file based on the namespace of that element.

This XML format is schema-language agnostic and works for just about any schema language.

== Terminology ==
Capitalization in the &quot;schema&quot; word: there is some confusion as to when to use the capitalized spelling &quot;Schema&quot; and when to use the lowercase spelling. The lowercase form is a generic term and may refer to any type of schema, including DTD, XML Schema (aka XSD), RELAX NG, or others, and should always be written using lowercase except when appearing at the start of a sentence. The form &quot;Schema&quot; (capitalized) in common use in the XML community always refers to W3C XML Schema.

== Schema authoring choices ==
The focus of the &quot;schema&quot; definition is structure and some semantics of documents. However, schema design, just like design of databases, computer program, and other formal constructs, also involve many considerations of style, convention, and readability. Extensive discussions of schema design issues can be found in (for example) Maler (1995) and
DeRose (1997).

;Consistency: One obvious consideration is that tags and attribute names should use consistent conventions. For example, it would be unusual to create a schema where some element names are camelCase but others use underscores to separate parts of names, or other conventions.

;Clear and mnemonic names: As in other formal languages, good choices of names can help understanding, even though the names per se have no formal significance. Naming the appropriate tag &quot;chapter&quot; rather than &quot;tag37&quot; is a help to the reader. At the same time, this brings in issues of the choice of natural language. A schema to be used for Irish Gaelic documents will probably use the same language for element and attribute names, since that will be the language common to editors and readers.

;&quot;Tag&quot; vs &quot;attribute&quot; choice: Some information can &quot;fit&quot; readily in either an element or an attribute. Because attributes cannot contain elements in XML, this question only arises for components that have no further sub-structure that XML needs to be aware of (attributes do support multiple tokens, such as multiple IDREF values, which can be considered a slight exception). Attributes typically represent information associated with the entirety of the element on which they occur, while sub-elements introduce a new scope of their own.

;Text content: Some XML schemas, particularly ones that represent various kinds of documents, ensure that all &quot;text content&quot; (roughly, any part that one would speak if reading the document aloud) occurs as text, and never in attributes. However, there are many edge cases where this does not hold: First, there are XML documents which do not involve &quot;natural language&quot; at all, or only minimally, such as for telemetry, creation of vector graphics or mathematical formulae, and so on. Second, information like stage directions in plays, verse numbers in Classical and Scriptural works, and correction or normalization of spelling in transcribed works, all pose issues of interpretation that schema designers for such genres must consider.

;Schema reuse: A new &quot;XML schema&quot; can be developed from scratch, or can reuse some fragments of other &quot;XML schemas&quot;. All schema languages offer some tools (for example, codice_1 and modularization control over namespaces) and recommend reuse where practical. Various parts of the extensive and sophisticated Text Encoding Initiative schemas are also re-used in an extraordinary variety of other schemas.

;Semantic vs syntactic: Except for a RDF-related one, no &quot;schema language&quot; express formally semantic, only structure and data-types. Despite being the ideal, the inclusion of RDF assumptions is very poor and is not a recommendation in the &quot;schema development&quot; frameworks.

<text>Polystylism is the use of multiple styles or in literature, art, film, or, especially, music.

Some prominent contemporary polystylist composers include Peter Maxwell Davies, Alfred Schnittke, and John Zorn. Polystylist composers from earlier in the twentieth century include Charles Ives and Erik Satie. Among literary figures, James Joyce has been referred to as a polystylist. On the other hand, composers including Sofia Gubaidulina have rejected the term as not applicable to their work.

Though perhaps not the original source of the term, the first important discussion of the subject is Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s essay &quot;Polystylistic Tendencies in Modern Music (1971)&quot;. The composers cited by Schnittke as those who make use of polystylism are Alban Berg, Luciano Berio, Pierre Boulez, Edison Denisov, Hans Werner Henze, Mauricio Kagel, Jan Klusák, György Ligeti, Carl Orff, Arvo Pärt, Krzysztof Penderecki, Henri Pousseur, Rodion Shchedrin, Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Slonimsky, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Igor Stravinsky, Boris Tishchenko, Anton Webern, and Bernd Alois Zimmermann.

<text>Lachute () is a town in southwest Quebec, Canada, northwest of Montreal, on the Rivière du Nord, a tributary of the Ottawa River, and west of the Mirabel International Airport. It is located on Autoroute 50, at the junctions of Quebec Provincial Highways Route 148, Route 158, and Secondary Highways 327 and 329.

Lachute is the seat of Argenteuil Regional County Municipality. It also has a local airport: Lachute Airport. Its major industries include paper mills,lumber and various manufacturing plants. The population is just over 14,000 people.

==History==

Originally in the 17th century, &quot;La Chute&quot; identified a cataract or falls on the North River (&quot;Rivière du Nord&quot;) located about upstream from its confluence with the Ottawa River. In 1753, Antoine Brunet became the first francophone to settle in Lachute, temporarily. In 1796, Jedediah Lane, from Jericho, Vermont, bought several thousand acres of land on both sides of the North River, where Lachute is today. That same year, Hezekiah Clark and his family, also of Jericho, settled near the falls on the North River, followed by Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution. Two years later, the population of The Chute settlement (as it was then known by its English name) consisted of five families.

The village grew quickly; by 1803, 30 families were scattered on both banks of the North River, and by 1810, Lachute counted 83 families, including 211 children of school age. In 1804, a mill was built at the falls and the first general store opened in 1813. One year later, Sir John Johnson bought a large part of the Argenteuil Seigneury. Johnson built a sawmill and gave land for the construction of churches, helping to attract new settlers to Argenteuil. In 1825, Thomas Barron became the first judge, then the first mayor of Lachute. The Lachute post office was established in 1835.

From 1870 to 1880, Lachute went through another period of expansion, both in economic and social development; the railway linking Montreal and Ottawa was built through the centre of the small town. Industries were established: Félix Hamelin and Thomas Henry Ayers established a wool mill and Irishman James Crocket Wilson opened a paper mill.

In 1885, the Town of Lachute was incorporated with a population around 1300 persons, and in the same year, Lachute high school was founded. In 1901, electricity was brought to the town.
In 1966, Lachute and the Village of Ayersville merged, forming the &quot;Cité de Lachute&quot;. In 1971, during the construction of Montréal-Mirabel International Airport, a part of the Saint-Jérusalem Parish was added to Lachute. In 1981, &quot;Cité de Lachute&quot; became &quot;Ville de Lachute&quot;. In 2000, about of Mirabel&#x27;s territory were annexed by Lachute. In 2002, the &quot;Service de police municipale de Lachute&quot; was transferred to the Sûreté du Québec.

The Expo Lachute Fair is the oldest fair in Quebec and the second-oldest in all of Canada, running from 1825 to the present. In 1917, the Argenteuil Agricultural Society purchased land to hold the Expo Lachute Fair permanently in Lachute. In 1917, the construction of the grandstand and the track was completed, with new cattle and horse barns being constructed as time and money allowed. The Fall Fair was changed to a Spring Fair in 1925 so that it could be deemed strictly a livestock show. Lachute was not always host to the exhibition; from 1825 to 1826, inhabitants of the county of York met in the then-bustling business centre of St. Andrews, to form a society called the County of York Agricultural Society, later changed to the Two Mountains Agricultural Society, and finally the Argenteuil Agricultural Society. Today, the Expo Lachute Fair is still popular. An annual agriculture fair is held in July and the Fall Derby is in September. The fairgrounds are also used for several other local events throughout the year.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lachute had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="846633" wikidata="Q290000" url="?curid=846633" title="Shell corporation">
<text>A shell corporation is a company or corporation with no significant assets or operations often formed to obtain financing before beginning business. Shell companies were primarily vehicles for lawfully hiding the identity of their beneficial owners, and this is still the defining feature of shell companies due to the loopholes in the global corporate transparency initiatives. It may hold passive investments or be the registered owner of assets, such as intellectual property, or ships. Shell companies may be registered to the address of a company that provides a service setting up shell companies, and which may act as the agent for receipt of legal correspondence (such as an accountant or lawyer). The company may serve as a vehicle for business transactions without itself having any significant assets or operations. 

Shell companies are used for legitimate purposes but can be used for tax evasion, tax avoidance, money laundering, or to achieve a specific goal such as anonymity. Anonymity, in the context of shell companies, relates to anonymity of beneficial owners of the company. Anonymity may be sought to shield personal assets from others, such as a spouse when a marriage is breaking down, from creditors, or from government authorities.

Shell companies&#x27; legitimate business purposes are, for example, acting as trustee for a trust, and not engaging in any other activity on their own account. This structure creates limited liability for the trustee. A corporate shell can also be formed around a partnership to create limited liability for the partners, and other business ventures, or to immunize one part of a business from the risks of another part. Shell companies can be used to transfer assets from one company into a new one while leaving the liabilities in the former company. Shell companies are also used for privacy and security reasons by wealthy individuals and celebrities. Accordingly, shell companies may be used to generate both pecuniary and non- pecuniary private benefits by their beneficial owners.

==SEC definition==
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines a &quot;shell company&quot; as follows:

Shell company: The term shell company means a registrant, other than an asset-backed issuer as defined in Item 1101(b) of Regulation AB (§ 229.1101(b) of this chapter), that has:

(1) No or nominal operations; and

(2) Either:

(i) No or nominal assets;

(ii) Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or

(iii) Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.&#x27;
==Background==
Some shell companies may have previously had operations that shrank due to unfavorable market conditions or company mismanagement. A shell corporation may also arise when a company&#x27;s operations have been wound up, for example following a takeover, but the &quot;shell&quot; of the original company continues to exist. The term &quot;shell corporation&quot; does not describe the purpose of a corporate entity, but in general is more informative to classify an entity according to its role in a particular corporate structure; e.g. holding company, general partner, or a limited partner.

Shell companies are a main component of the underground economy, especially those based in tax havens. They may also be known as &quot;international business companies&quot;, &quot;personal investment companies&quot;, &quot;front companies&quot;, or &quot;&quot;mailbox&quot; companies&quot;. While these terms are generally used interchangeably in practice, their meanings are not the same and each term is generated to refer to a different theme of illegality. Shell companies can also be used for tax avoidance. A classic tax avoidance operation may utilize favorable transfer pricing among multiple corporate entities to lower tax liability in a certain country; e.g. Double Irish arrangement.

A special purpose entity, used often in the context of a larger corporate structure, may be formed to achieve a specific goal, such as to create anonymity.

According to a 2013 experimental study where the researchers requested anonymous incorporation in violation of international law, one in four corporate service providers offered to provide services in violation of international law. 

==Examples==
Shell companies can be used to transfer assets of one company into a new company without having the liabilities of the former company. For example, when Sega Sammy Holdings purchased the bankrupt Index Corporation in June 2013, they formed a shell company in September 2013, called Sega Dream Corporation, into which were transferred valuable assets of the old company, including the Atlus brand and Index Corporation&#x27;s intellectual property. This meant that the liabilities of the old company were left in the old company, and Sega Dream had clean title to all the assets of the old company. The former Index Corporation was then dissolved. Sega Dream Corporation was renamed as Index Corporation in November 2013.

When Hilco purchased HMV Canada, they used a shell company by the name of Huk 10 Ltd. in order to secure funds and minimize liability. HMV was then sued by Huk 10 Ltd., allowing Hilco to regain assets and dispose of HMV Canada.

As another example, the use of a shell company in a tax haven makes it possible to move profits to that shell company, in a strategy of tax evasion. A United States company buying products from overseas would have to pay US taxes on the profits, but to avoid this, it may buy the products through a non-resident shell company based in a tax haven, where it is described as an offshore company. The shell company would purchase the products in its name, mark up the products and sell them on to the US company, thereby transferring the profit to the tax haven. (The products may never actually physically pass through that tax haven, and be shipped directly to the US company.) As the shell company is not based in the United States, its profit is not subject to US income tax, and as it is an offshore company in the tax haven jurisdiction, it is not taxed there either. Under the tax haven law, the profits are deemed not to have been made in the jurisdiction, with the sale deemed to have taken place in the United States. As US personal income tax is significantly less important than corporate income tax, US company executives would claim a salary (or fees, consulting fees, etc.) from the company&#x27;s profits.

In addition, there are several shell companies that are used by broadcasting groups to circumvent FCC limits on television station ownership. For example, Sinclair Broadcasting Group forms local marketing agreements with stations owned by Cunningham Broadcasting and Deerfield Media; nearly all of the stock of Cunningham Broadcasting is controlled by trusts in the name of the owner&#x27;s children. Other examples include Nexstar Media Group controlling television stations owned by Mission Broadcasting and Vaughan Media.

== Countries of domicile ==
Typical countries of domicile of shell companies are offshore financial centres like Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands including Guernsey and Jersey in Europe, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, and Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, Panama in Central America, and Hong Kong and Singapore in Asia. Shell companies are usually offered by law firms based in those countries. The process of establishing a shell company can sometimes be done very quickly online.

In 2021 anonymous corporations were made illegal in the United States with the passage of the Corporate Transparency Act as part of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. Exemptions were included which are meant to limit its scope to the entities most likely to be used for illicit purposes. Companies which are exempt from the act include foreign companies that do not formally register to do business and companies that fall into one of 24 enumerated categories, which include companies that employ more than 20 people, have revenues above $5 million, and a physical presence in the United States, as well as churches, charities, non-profits, trusts and partnerships. Companies that are banks, broker-dealers, public issuers, and insurance companies are also exempt.

Due to federalism in the United States, shell companies are often set up in states such as Delaware, Nevada, and Wyoming due to advantageous tax regimes.

==Abuse==
Shell companies have been used to commit fraud, by creating an empty shell company with a name similar to existing real companies, then running up the price of the empty shell and suddenly selling it (pump and dump).

There are also shell companies that were created for the purpose of owning assets (including tangibles, such as a real estate for property development, and intangibles, such as royalties or copyrights) and receiving income. The reasons behind creating such a shell company may include protection against litigation and/or tax benefits (some expenses that would not be deductible for an individual may be deductible for a corporation). Sometimes, shell companies are used for tax evasion or tax avoidance.

=== Offshore Leaks ===

In 2013 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published a report called &quot;Offshore Leaks&quot; with information about the use and owners of 130,000 shell companies. Many of the shell companies belonged to politicians and celebrities from around the world and were being used for tax evasion and hiding financial assets.

=== Panama Papers ===

In 2016 a leak of 11.5 million documents to the German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; revealed information about owners of more than 214,000 shell companies administered by the law firm Mossack Fonseca in Panama. The shell companies were used by politicians, businessmen, autocrats, and terrorists from around the world for tax evasion and other illegal activities.

===India===
After India&#x27;s decision to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1000 rupee notes on 8 November 2016, various authorities noticed a surge in shell companies depositing cash in banks, possibly in an attempt to hide the real owner of the wealth. In response, in July 2017, the authorities ordered nearly 2,000 shell companies to be shut down while Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) imposed trading restrictions on 162 listed entities as shell companies. A high-level task force found that hundreds of shell companies were registered in a few buildings in Kolkata. Many of those were found to be locked, with their padlocks coated in dust and many others which had office space the size of cubicles.

== Regulation ==
Since shell companies are very often abused for various illegal purposes, regulation of shell companies is becoming more important to prevent such illegal activities.

=== United Kingdom ===
Currently British overseas territories and crown dependencies are only required to tell the true name of owners of shell companies upon request from official law enforcement agencies. However, since 2020 they are forced to publish these names in a public register in order to prevent anonymous use of shell companies.

=== United States ===
The new customer due diligence (CDD) rule from 2016 requires that banks know the identities of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, enabling them to disclose this information to law enforcement agencies, thus aiding in the identification true business owners and their tax liabilities. Thereby, the rule aims to prevent the anonymous misuse of shell companies. The rule is administered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In January 2021, anonymous shell companies were effectively banned via a provision in the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.

=== India === 
A &quot;Task Force On Shell Corporations&quot; was constituted in 2017 under the chairmanship of the Revenue Secretary to the Government Of India and Corporate Affairs Secretary to Govt. Of India, for effectively tackling malpractice by shell companies in a comprehensive manner.

=== European Union ===
On 22 December 2021, the European Commission adopted a proposal for an EU Directive to tackle the misuse of shell companies for tax purposes. Also known as the &quot;Unshell&quot; directive, the proposal requires the unanimous agreement of all 27 EU Member States&#x27; finance ministers before entering into force.

<text>Tsavo is a region of Kenya located at the crossing of the Uganda Railway over the Tsavo River, close to where it meets the Athi-Galana-Sabaki River. Two national parks, Tsavo East and Tsavo West are located in the area.

The meaning of the word &quot;Tsavo&quot; is still unclear, but because of tribal conflicts, the Kamba people used to refer to the region as the place of &quot;slaughter&quot;. Until the British put an end to the slave trade in the late 19th century, Tsavo was continually crossed by caravans of trans-Saharan slave traders and their captives. 

== Flora and fauna ==
Typical flora of the region includes:
*Acacia
*Myrrh
*Baobab

Typical fauna of the region includes:
*African bush elephant
*Giraffe
*African buffalo
*Gazelle
*Klipspringer
*Kudu
*Leopard
*Lion
*Cheetah
== Cultural depictions ==
Tsavo has many myths and legends such as The Ghosts of Tsavo, which tells of two brothers, The one of the Ghost, and the other of The Darkness. It was said that these brothers will forever be reincarnated as two lions.

The 1996 film &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; depicts a fictionalized account of the Tsavo Man-Eaters, which were killed by John Henry Patterson in 1898.

<doc id="846639" wikidata="Q2373669" url="?curid=846639" title="Sydney Box">
<text>Frank Sydney Box (29 April 1907 – 25 May 1983) was a British film producer and screenwriter, and brother of British film producer Betty Box. In 1940, he founded the documentary film company Verity Films with Jay Lewis.

He produced and co-wrote the screenplay, with his then wife director Muriel Box, for &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot; (1945), which received the 1946 Oscar for best original screenplay.

Sydney and Muriel married in 1935, had a daughter Leonora the following year, and divorced in 1969.

==Gainsborough Studios==
The couple were hired after the war by the Rank Organisation to run Gainsborough Studios. They disapproved of the Gainsborough melodramas which had been the studio&#x27;s major successes for several years, and switched production to a broader range of more &quot;realistic&quot; films with mixed results. Box made 36 films at Gainsborough, which was merged into the Rank Organization in 1949. It has been argued Box&#x27;s overexpansion &quot;killed&quot; Gainsborough.

In 1951 Box founded his own production company London Independent Producers with William MacQuitty.

Box ended his cinema career in 1958 to concentrate on working in television. He was part of a consortium that launched the ITV franchise, Tyne Tees Television in 1959.

According to Sue Harper and Vincent Porter:
Box was a skilled entrepreneur who was able to raise regular loans from the NFFC and to encourage others’ talents. According to his assistant David Deutsch, he provided, more effectively than anyone he had ever known, ‘the right environment for creative people to work, welcoming, encouraging and subtly influencing’. Box’s position as an outsider—a socialist of sorts, a realist by instinct, and a feminist by default—meant that he became increasingly excluded from the meritocracy. He lacked a strong visual sense, but this was supplied by Muriel Box, whose lively inventiveness was accompanied by an uncompromising sexual radicalism, which pleased her but not the distributors or the audiences.

<text>Al-Fao was a project for a self-propelled artillery system designed for the former Iraqi Army by the Canadian weapons engineer Gerald Bull. It would have been one of the world&#x27;s most powerful artillery pieces, with a 53-caliber, gun firing 109-kilogram shells over a range of . The Al-Fao system was to weigh 44 tonnes, and its 550 hp engine was to give it a top speed of on roads, and cross-country. The Al-Fao&#x27;s autoloader was to provide it with a rate of fire of four rounds a minute.

A self-propelled howitzer using the same 155 mm gun as the South African G6, similar to the Al-Fao and named Majnoon, was also designed by Gerald Bull on an Iraqi order.

==History==
The design of the Majnoon and Al-Fao started around 1988. That year, South Africa had tried to sell the G6 howitzer to Iraq, but the Iraqis found it too expensive, and requested that Bull design two equivalents for them. Prototypes of each model had to be ready by May 1989, in time for the Baghdad International Arms Fair. Numerous French, German and Spanish companies were contracted to manufacture parts for the guns, while the design for the chassis was bought in Czechoslovakia and modified to South African specifications. The deadline was met, and the prototypes of both Majnoon and Al-Fao were presented at the Arms Fair, although these were far from complete. However, by early 1990, the Iraqis had imported all the know-how, equipment and machinery necessary to produce them, as well as ammunition. Subsequent events prevented the realisation of the Majnoon and Al-Fao projects.

<text>The director of the U.S. Government Publishing Office, formerly the public printer of the United States, is the head of the United States Government Publishing Office (GPO). Pursuant to , this officer is nominated by the president of the United States and approved by the United States Senate. The title was changed to &quot;Director&quot; when in December 2014, Congress passed and President Obama signed into law H.R. 83, which consolidated and continued appropriations for FY 2015. Section 1301 of that act changed the name of the Government Printing Office to the Government Publishing Office and the title of public printer to director. Thus, Davita Vance-Cooks was the last public printer of the United States and the first director of the U.S. Government Publishing Office. 
The director is responsible for the administration of the GPO. The GPO, a legislative agency of the government, provides electronic access to and produced most printed matter for government, including the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, Supreme Court decisions, passports, tax forms, internal government documents, and agency publications. The GPO did not print money, as that is a duty of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

==History==
Benjamin Franklin served as Public Printer for several of the American colonies prior to the establishment of the United States. The House and Senate had separate printers until 1861, when the GPO was established; its first superintendent was John D. Defrees. The first man with the title Public Printer of the United States was Almon M. Clapp.

<text>The Night Porter () is a 1974 Italian psychological war drama film co-written and directed by Liliana Cavani. It stars Dirk Bogarde and Charlotte Rampling, with Philippe Leroy, Gabriele Ferzetti and Isa Miranda in supporting roles. Set in Vienna in 1957, the film centers on the sadomasochistic relationship between a former Nazi concentration camp officer (Bogarde) and one of his inmates (Rampling).

The film&#x27;s themes of sexual and sadomasochistic obsession, and its use of Holocaust imagery, have made the film controversial since its initial release, dividing critics over its artistic value. In July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival.

==Plot==
During World War II, Maximilian Theo Aldorfer, a Nazi SS officer who posed as a doctor to take sensational photographs in concentration camps, and Lucia, a teenage girl interned in one such camp due to her father&#x27;s socialist political ties, had an ambiguous sadomasochistic relationship. Max tormented Lucia, but also acted as her protector.

In 1957, Lucia, now married to an American orchestra conductor, meets Max again by chance. He is now a night porter at a hotel in Vienna, and a reluctant member of a group of former SS comrades who have been carefully covering up their pasts by destroying documents and eliminating witnesses to their wartime activities. Max has an upcoming mock trial at the hands of the group for his war crimes. The group&#x27;s leader, Hans Vogler, accuses Max of wanting to live &quot;hidden away like a church mouse.&quot; Max wishes to remain hidden, but voices support for the group&#x27;s activities.

Memories of the past punctuate Max and Lucia&#x27;s present with urgent frequency, suggesting that Lucia survived through her relationship with Max—in one such remembered scene, Lucia sings a Marlene Dietrich song, &quot;Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte&quot; (&quot;If I Could Make a Wish&quot;), to the camp guards while wearing pieces of an SS uniform, and Max &quot;rewards&quot; her with the severed head of a male inmate who had been bullying her, referencing Salome.

Because she could testify against him, Lucia&#x27;s existence is a threat to Max and his former comrades. He goes to see a former Nazi collaborator, Mario, who knows Lucia is still alive; Max murders him offscreen to protect his secret and Lucia. After Lucia&#x27;s husband leaves town on business, Max and Lucia renew their past lovemaking in Max&#x27;s apartment. Max confesses to Countess Stein, another guest at his hotel, that he has found his &quot;little girl&quot; again. The Countess tells him that he is insane; Max replies that they are both &quot;in the same boat.&quot; Meanwhile, Vogler has Max spied on by Adolph, a youth who works at the hotel.

Max is interviewed by the police about Mario&#x27;s murder. He spends days with Lucia in his apartment, chaining her to the wall so that &quot;they can&#x27;t take her away&quot;, and sleeps little. Vogler, who wants Lucia to testify against Max in the mock trial—though he harbors more ambiguous long-term intentions towards her—visits and informs her that Max is ill. He suggests that Lucia must also be ill to allow herself to be in this position, but she sends him away, claiming to be with Max of her own free will.

The former SS officers are infuriated at Max for hiding a key witness. Max refuses to proceed with the trial, calling it a &quot;farce,&quot; and admits that he works as a night porter due to his sense of shame in daytime. He returns to Lucia, telling her that the police questioned him and others at the hotel about her disappearance, and that no suspicion fell on him. Eventually, Max quits his job, devoting all of his time to Lucia. The former SS officers cut off the couple&#x27;s supply of food from a nearby grocery store. When Max briefly walks along an outdoor terrace, Vogler shoots and wounds him. Max barricades the door to the apartment, and he and Lucia begin rationing.

Max seeks help by phoning one of his old hotel friends, who refuses, and imploring his neighbour, who is unwilling to provide aid and harbouring Adolph in her apartment. Max retreats again to the apartment, where Lucia is almost unconscious from malnutrition. After one of the former SS officers cuts off the electricity to Max&#x27;s apartment, Max and Lucia, respectively dressed in his Nazi uniform and a negligee resembling one he gave her in the concentration camp, leave the building and drive away, followed by a car driven by Max&#x27;s former colleagues. Max parks on a bridge, and he and Lucia get out and walk along the bridge rail as dawn breaks. Two gunshots ring out, and the lovers fall dead.

==Cast==
==Production==

Filming took place in Vienna and at Cinecittà Studios in Rome. Locations included the Vienna Volksoper, the Linke Wienzeile Buildings, the Mozarthaus, the Vienna Central Cemetery, Karl-Marx-Hof, and Schönbrunn Palace. The concentration camp scenes were shot in the Tuscolano district of Rome. The film&#x27;s costumes were designed by five-time Oscar-nominee Piero Tosi.

The budget, which had been paid for by the Italian distributor, ran out near the end of the shooting of the film&#x27;s interiors at Cinecittà. To ensure the film&#x27;s completion, producer Robert Gordon Edwards instructed editor Franco Arcalli to create a rough cut of the best scenes that had been shot, which he presented to an American colleague who worked at Les Artistes Associés (the French arm of United Artists). On the basis of the rough cut, the company agreed to pay for the filming of the exterior scenes in Vienna in exchange for French distribution rights.

Romy Schneider turned down the role of Lucia. Mia Farrow was considered, as well as Dominique Sanda, before Charlotte Rampling was cast. Rampling shot the film only four months after giving birth to her son Barnaby. She and Dirk Bogarde re-wrote and ad-libbed much of their dialogue. Bogarde also enlisted Anthony Forwood to help rewrite the script, uncredited. Bogarde seriously considered retiring from acting after the end of principal photography, which he considered a very draining experience.

Several of the actors&#x27; voices were dubbed, including Philippe Leroy (by Edmund Purdom), Gabriele Ferzetti (by David de Keyser) and Geoffrey Copleston (by Charles Howerton).

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Night Porter&quot; salaciousness gives its exploration of historical trauma a bitter aftertaste, but audiences seeking provocation are unlikely to forget the sting of this erotic drama.&quot; In response to &quot;The Night Porter&quot;, Cavani was both celebrated for her courage in dealing with the theme of sexual transgression and, simultaneously, castigated for the controversial manner in which she presented that transgression within the context of a Nazi Holocaust narrative.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; thought the main roles were well-performed, but nonetheless gave the film one star out of four, and called &quot;The Night Porter&quot; &quot;as nasty as it is lubricious, a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering&quot;, while adding that he did not &quot;object per se to the movie&#x27;s subject matter.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Nora Sayre praised the performances of Bogarde and Rampling, and the &quot;dark, rich tones&quot; of the cinematography, but began her review by writing, &quot;If you don&#x27;t love pain, you won&#x27;t find &quot;The Night Porter&quot; erotic—and by now, even painbuffs may be satiated with Nazi decadence.&quot; Vincent Canby, also writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;romantic pornography&quot; and &quot;a piece of junk&quot;. Leonard Maltin&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Movie Guide&quot; called it a &quot;[s]leazy, bizarre drama&quot;, awarding it two out of four stars.

In Europe, the film was met with opposition as well. German magazine &quot;Filmdienst&quot; categorised the film as &quot;political pornography&quot;. Despite the poor German critical response, it grossed over $1.3 million. In the French &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, Michel Foucault criticised what he saw as a sexualised vision of Nazism.

In her 2000 essay for the Criterion Collection release, Annette Insdorf called &quot;The Night Porter&quot; &quot;a provocative and problematic film. ... [I]t can be seen as an exercise in perversion and exploitation of the Holocaust for the sake of sensationalism. On the other hand, a closer reading of this English-language psychological thriller suggests a dark vision of compelling characters doomed by their World War II past.&quot; In his 2020 review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw described the film as a &quot;dated&quot; but &quot;intriguing period piece&quot;, adding, &quot;Perhaps there is something in its very crassness, horror and tastelessness that does at least jolt us towards an acknowledgment of pure evil.&quot;

Mikel J. Koven characterised &quot;The Night Porter&quot; as a &quot;Nazi sexploitation&quot; film.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated in two categories at the 1975 Nastro d&#x27;Argento Awards, for Best Director (Liliana Cavani) and for Best Screenplay (Cavani and Italo Moscati), but did not win in either category.

<text>Alan R. Templeton is an American geneticist and statistician at Washington University in St. Louis, where he is the Charles Rebstock emeritus professor of biology. From 2010 to 2019, he held positions in the Institute of Evolution and the Department of Evolutionary and Environmental Biology at the University of Haifa. He is known for his work demonstrating the degree of genetic diversity among humans and, in his opinion, the biological unreality of human races.

==Research==

In 2002, Templeton published a genetic analysis showing that some gene variants that are present in modern populations existed already in Asia hundreds of thousands of years ago. This meant that even if our male line (Y chromosome) and our female line (mitochondrial DNA) came out of Africa in the last 100,000 years or so, we have inherited other genes from populations that were already outside of Africa. Since this study other studies have been done using much more data (see Phylogeography).

According to Templeton&#x27;s research, perceived differences in races are more related to cultural perceptions and biases than any underlying genetic reality. For example, Templeton&#x27;s statistical analysis of the human genome shows that much greater genetic diversity exists between populations of chimpanzees than humans from different parts of the world.

Using data from the International HapMap Project and the 1000 Genomes project, Templeton and a team of researchers looked at mutations encompassing the gephyrin gene of chromosome 14 and were able to trace the split back to the last common ancestor.

<text>Messor is a genus of myrmicine ants with more than 100 species, all of which are harvester ants; the generic name comes from the Roman god of crops and harvest, Messor. The subterranean colonies tend to be found in open fields and near roadsides, openings are directly to the surface.

Colonies can achieve huge sizes and are notable for their intricately designed granaries in which seeds are stored in dry conditions, preventing germination. The structure of &quot;Messor&quot; spp. nests is complex and the genus on the whole is one of very accomplished architects.

&quot;Messor&quot; spp. are polymorphic and have a distinct caste of macrocephalic dinoergates whose role is carrying and cutting the large seeds which comprise much of the colonies&#x27; subsistence. Although they primarily feed on seeds, they occasionally eat insects and snails. Some snail shells possibly are taken into the nest because of their grain-like shape.

Equipped with a tough, shining cuticle, &quot;Messor&quot; spp. are slow-moving and form long, seed-carrying runs. Colonies tend to be monogynous - founded by a single queen alone.

Looking specifically at the &quot;M. arenarius&quot; species for example, like some other types of harvester ants, they emit trail pheromones as well as operating on an individual level when looking for food sources.

<text>Pagani Automobili S.p.A. (commonly referred to as Pagani) is an Italian manufacturer of sports cars and carbon fiber components. The company was founded in 1992 by Argentine-Italian businessman and engineer Horacio Pagani and is based in San Cesario sul Panaro, near Modena, Italy.

== History ==
Horacio Pagani, who formerly created and managed Lamborghini&#x27;s composites department, founded Pagani Composite Research in 1988. This new company worked with Lamborghini on numerous projects, including the restyling of the Lamborghini Countach 25th Anniversary Edition, the Lamborghini LM002, the P140 design concept, and the Diablo. In the late 1980s, Pagani began designing his own car, then referred to as the &quot;C8 Project&quot;. Pagani planned to rename the C8 the &quot;Fangio F1&quot; to honour his friend, the Argentine five-time Formula One champion, Juan Manuel Fangio.

In 1991, Pagani established Modena Design to meet the increasing demand for his design, engineering, and prototyping services. In 1992, he began construction of a Fangio F1 prototype, and by 1993, the car was being tested at the Dallara wind tunnel with positive results. In 1994, Mercedes-Benz agreed to supply Pagani with V12 engines. The cost of these cars are at a total of 2.3 million dollars.

The final car was named the Zonda C12, the first of the Zonda line (the Fangio F1 name was dropped out of respect for Fangio, who died in 1995). It was first presented at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show.

In 2005, Pagani announced that it planned to triple its production output within the next three years, and to enter the US market in 2007.

On 30 June 2010, Pagani claimed a new record for production-based cars using the Pagani Zonda R and completing the Nürburgring in 6:47, beating the Ferrari 599XX.

== Pagani Zonda ==
Pagani&#x27;s first model, the Zonda, is powered by a mid-mounted DOHC V12 engine manufactured by Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s AMG division. The car&#x27;s design was inspired by jet fighters and the famous Sauber-Mercedes Silver Arrow Group C cars, and features several unique design elements, including its circular four pipe exhaust system.

The Zonda&#x27;s production run ended with the Zonda HP Barchetta. Only three were produced with one unit retained for Horacio Pagani&#x27;s personal collection and the other two costing US$15M.

=== Zonda Cinque ===
Pagani announced a variant of the Zonda named &quot;Zonda Cinque&quot; which was introduced as a 2009 model. The Cinque is based on the track-only Zonda R, but features a new Mercedes-Benz M297 V12 engine, active aerodynamics, and features exterior elements from the newly developed material &quot;carbon-titanium fibre&quot;, which is stronger and lighter than typical carbon fibre. Only five were produced, all of which were already spoken for.

Pagani announced the Zonda Cinque Roadster in July 2009, of which only five were produced. The roadster uses the same Mercedes-Benz M297 V12 engine as the coupé version, but has been made lighter and stronger to keep the car structurally rigid. Both the coupe and the roadster accelerate from 0– in 3.4 seconds, 0– in 9.6 seconds and have a top speed of . The Cinque uses carbon-ceramic brakes from Brembo. They help decelerate the car from –0 mph in 3.1 seconds and –0mph in 4.3 seconds. The maximum side acceleration is 1.45g with road tyres. The car produces of downforce at .

=== Zonda Tricolore ===
At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Pagani announced the exclusive Zonda Tricolore, built to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Frecce Tricolori, the Italian Air Force&#x27;s aerobatic squadron. Originally intended to be limited to a single car, eventually three were produced. The Tricolore is based on a top specification Zonda Cinque, built on a carbon titanium chassis with sequential transmission and titanium exhausts. The mid-mounted 7.3L M297 V12 engine produces , which helps the car achieve a top speed of and a 0– acceleration time of 3.2 seconds.

== Pagani Huayra ==
The Pagani Huayra, a successor to the Pagani Zonda, was initially revealed online in a press release on 25 January 2011. It was officially revealed at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. The car is named after the Quechua god of wind, Huayra-tata. The engine is a 6.0-litre twin-turbo M158 V12 engine from Mercedes-AMG producing and of torque. The Huayra&#x27;s body is made from carbotanium; a lightweight composition of carbon fibre and titanium. The Huayra has been redesigned from the ground up, but shares many visual qualities with its predecessor. The car can accelerate from 0 to in 3.2 seconds and has a top speed of . Only 100 units of the Huayra were produced, each costing £1,000,000 (1.05 million US$) without options.

=== Huayra BC ===
An extreme, track-focused version of the Huayra called the Huayra BC was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The Huayra BC is named after the late Benny Caiola, a friend of Horacio Pagani, and the first Pagani customer. The Huayra BC has an improved version of the standard Huayra&#x27;s engine, producing and of torque. The weight is reduced by to just , thanks to the use of an all-new material called &#x27;carbon-triax&#x27; in the car which Pagani claims is 50% lighter and 20% stronger than regular carbon fibre, giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of per horsepower. The Huayra BC uses a lightweight titanium exhaust system, new aluminum alloy wheels, and a stripped-out interior. The tyres are Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tires that feature 12 different rubber compounds, and the suspension and wishbones are made of aeronautical grade aluminum, known as Avional. The Huayra BC also has a new front bumper with a front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an air diffuser that stretches the entire width of the rear bumper along with a large rear wing. The car uses an Xtrac 7-speed sequential manual transmission and has an electro-hydraulic actuation system. Pagani has stuck with a single-clutch gearbox because it weighs 40% less than double-clutch gearboxes.

30 units of the Huayra BC were made, despite the claim by Pagani that the model was limited to 20 units. Each unit cost in excess of €2.1 million (2.21 million US$).

Later, Pagani unveiled the Huayra Roadster BC and produced 40 units.

=== Huayra Roadster ===
After 2 years of development, the Huayra Roadster was officially unveiled in the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. 

The design of the car underwent several changes, with the most noticeable being the rear, with updated eyelid-like fixed flaps that continued with the design and eventually ended on the rear lights. Vents were included on the rear engine cover for efficient cooling of the engine, and the wheels were updated specifically for the car along with Pirelli P-Zero tires, along with the addition of a spoiler at the front. The car has conventional doors instead of the Gull-wing doors used in the coupé as such doors cannot be fitted to an open top car. The car has the same twin-turbo V12 engine as the coupé but with the power upgraded to at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 2,400 rpm. The power is delivered to the rear wheels via a Xtrac 7-speed sequential manual transmission which is 40% lighter than its coupé counterpart. The car was constructed by a material developed by Pagani called &#x27;carbon triax&#x27;, which is a combination of tri-axis fibre glass with carbon fibre. This allowed the car to weigh less than its coupé counterpart, for a total of , making it the first roadster lighter than the coupé. Only 100 were made, all of which were sold even before production ended. 

Pagani said that the car could accelerate at 1.8 G.

=== Bespoke editions ===
Continuing its tradition with the Zonda, Pagani produced several bespoke Huayras.
* Huayra Carbon Edition (bare carbon exterior)
* Huayra White Edition (Snow white exterior with carbon fibre bits)
* Huayra La Monza Lisa (bare carbon exterior with tri-colore pinstriping, inspired by the Zonda R) – commissioned by Kris Singh
* Huayra 730 S &quot;Da Vinci&quot; (tinted blue carbon exterior with gold accents and wheels, inspired by the Zonda tri-colore) – originally commissioned by Alejandro Salomon
* Huayra BC Kingtasma (tinted red carbon exterior with tri-colore pinstriping and gold crowns beneath the two rear flaps featuring a roof scoop)

* Huayra Dinastia (three special edition bespoke cars produced for the Chinese market inspired by Chinese traditions)
* Huayra II Ultimo (final Pagani Huayra coupé featuring the optional pacchetto tempesta aero package along with a bespoke roof scoop and rear wing with a paint job inspired by Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s F1 car)
* Huayra Hermes Edition (a 1 of 1 custom Coach-Built Pagani Huayra with interior/exterior detailing by Hermes. The car is owned and was partly customised by Iranian-American entrepreneur; Manny Khoshbin)
* Huayra Pieagoni TPG (black and white carbon exterior) commissioned by a Dallas based watch dealer and car collector.
* Huayra Codalunga (a 1 of 5 longtail version of the Huayra)

== Pagani Utopia ==
The successor to the Huayra, named Utopia, was revealed on 12 September 2022. A total of 99 examples of the closed coupé model are planned, with open and track variants possible in the future. All 99 coupés are already assigned to the customers. The first car was delivered in October 2023. The Utopia uses the same M158 twin-turbocharged V12 engine as the Huayra, designed and built by Mercedes-AMG, but upgraded to produce at 6000 rpm and of torque available between 2800 and 5900 rpm. Pagani partnered with Xtrac to develop a 7-speed gearbox that will be mounted transversely, available as a pure manual or an automated manual, and coupled with an electro-mechanical differential by a triple plate clutch.

<doc id="846692" wikidata="Q5100858" url="?curid=846692" title="Chinese paper folding">
<text>Chinese paper folding, or zhezhi (), is the art of paper folding that originated in medieval China.

The work of 20th-century Japanese paper artist Akira Yoshizawa widely popularized the Japanese word &quot;origami&quot;; however, in China and other Chinese-speaking areas, the art is referred to by the Chinese name, &quot;zhezhi&quot;. Traditional Chinese paper folding concentrates mainly on objects like boats or hats rather than the animals and flowers of Japanese origami. A recent innovation is from the &quot;Golden Venture&quot; migrants where large representational objects are made from modular forms.

==History==
Paper was first invented by Cai Lun during the Eastern Han dynasty era. In the 6th century, Buddhist monks carried paper to Japan. The earliest document showing paper folding is a picture of a small paper boat in an edition of Tractatus de sphaera mundi from 1490 by Johannes de Sacrobosco. However it is very likely that paper folding originated much earlier than that in China and Japan for ceremonial purposes. In China, traditional funerals include burning folded paper, most often representations of gold nuggets (yuanbao). This practice probably started when papers gradually become popular and cheaper in China, and it seems to have become quite common during the Song dynasty (905–1125 CE). In Japan origami butterflies were used during the celebration of Shinto weddings to represent the bride and groom, so ceremonial paperfolding had probably already become a significant aspect of Japanese ceremony by the Heian period (794–1185) of Japanese history.

===Significant early publications===
Maying Soong&#x27;s 1948 book, &quot;The Art of Chinese Paper Folding&quot;, helped popularise recreational paper folding in the 20th century, and was possibly the first to distinguish the difference between Chinese versus Japanese paper folding – where the Chinese focus primarily on inanimate objects, such as boats or pagoda, the Japanese include representations of living forms, such as the crane. It contains a number of simple traditional designs, some of which are also found in the traditions of other countries. A number of the models are folded from the blintz base, a form also common in traditional European and Japanese paper folding. The &quot;Old Scholar&#x27;s Hat&quot; is among the old Chinese models found in this book. and the main quote of this book.

==Three dimensional origami==
In 1993, a group of Chinese refugees were detained on the ship &quot;Golden Venture&quot; and held in an American prison, where they began making elaborate models combining traditional Chinese modular paperfolding (utilizing materials such as magazine covers) with a form of papier-mâché (using toilet tissue); these models were given to those helping the refugees and sold at charity fundraisers. Media coverage of the refugees helped popularize traditional Chinese modular folding worldwide, which became known as &quot;Golden Venture folding&quot;.

This type of modular folding is often done with Chinese paper money. Triangles are folded from multiple pieces of 1:2 aspect ratio paper, and connected by inserting a flap of one triangle into a pocket on the next. Popular subjects include pineapples, swans, and ships. This form of modular origami is commonly referred to as &quot;3D origami&quot;.

<doc id="846696" wikidata="Q3357764" url="?curid=846696" title="Orléans (federal electoral district)">
<text>Orléans (formerly Ottawa—Orléans, Gloucester—Carleton and Carleton—Gloucester) is a federal electoral district in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1988.

The riding was created as &quot;Carleton—Gloucester&quot; in 1987. Its name was changed to &quot;Gloucester—Carleton&quot; in 1996, but then changed back to &quot;Carleton–Gloucester&quot; in 1997. It was changed again in 2000 to &quot;Ottawa—Orléans&quot; and to just &quot;Orléans&quot; in 2013.

Despite having an English-speaking majority, Orléans is among the most francophone of the Ontario federal ridings, and a major centre of the Franco-Ontarian community. According to the 2001 Statistics Canada report, 35% of the riding population speaks French as their mother tongue. In recent years, the riding has experienced a major growth of population and increased housing projects.

In the 2004 federal election, the Liberal candidate Marc Godbout won over the Conservative candidate Walter Robinson by over 4% of the votes. Robinson, a former president of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, was considered a favourite but failed to win support among Francophones. Ottawa—Orléans was also the riding where the NDP had Canada&#x27;s youngest woman candidate, Crystal LeBlanc, who received 5905 votes in the 2004 federal election.

==Geography==
It encompasses the suburban community of Orleans in the east end of Ottawa, Ontario (northern and eastern parts of the former city of Gloucester, Ontario plus the northwestern corner of the former city of Cumberland) as well as the neighbourhood of Blackburn Hamlet and the communities of Notre-Dame-des-Champs and Carlsbad Springs.

The riding consists of the part of the City of Ottawa bounded on the north by the Ottawa River, and on the west, south and east by a line drawn due south from the river to the mouth of Green&#x27;s Creek, south along that creek, southwest along Regional Road 174 to Blair Road, south to Innes Road, west to a transmission line, south to an abandoned Canadian Pacific Railway track, west to Highway 417, southeast to Ramsayville Road, south to Mitch Owens Road, east to Boundary Road, south to Devine Road, east to Frontier Road, north to Carlsbad Lane and its northern production to Tenth Line Road, north to Wall Road, east to Frank Kenny Road, north to Frank Kenny Road, north to the Ottawa River.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 65.5% White, 10.5% Black, 5.2% Arab, 5.0% Indigenous, 4.9% South Asian, 2.2% Chinese, 1.4% West Asian, 1.3% Latin American, 1.2% Filipino

**bounded on the north by the City of Ottawa, and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the boundary south along Conroy Road, west along Davidson Road and Lester Road, south along Albion Road, west along the road allowance between lots 10 and 11, Concession 3, south along the Canadian Pacific Railway line, west along Leitrim Road, north along Limebank Road and River Road to the Ottawa city limit;
**bounded on the west by the Gloucester city limit, and on the north, east and south by a line drawn east from the limit near Blair Road, south along Blair Road, west along Innes Road, and south along a hydroelectric transmission line situated east of Meadowvale Lane to the western city limit;
* the southeast part of the City of Ottawa lying south of Walkley Road and east of Conroy Road;
*the townships of Osgoode and Rideau;
*the northwest part of the Township of Cumberland lying north of Innes Road and west of Regional Road 57 and Trim Road.

In 1996, it was renamed &quot;Gloucester—Carleton&quot;, and defined to consist of
* the City of Gloucester, excluding
**the part bounded on the north by the City of Ottawa, and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the border south along Conroy Road, west along Davidson Road and Lester Road, south along the Canadian Pacific Railway, west along Leitrim Road, and north along Limebank Road to the City of Ottawa;
** the part bounded on the west by the western city limit, and on the north, east and south by a line drawn from the city limit near Mowat Road east to Blair Road, south along Blair Road, west along Innes Road, and south along the transmission line situated east of Meadowvale Lane to the western city limit.
** the part bounded on the north by the Quebec border, and on the west by the western city limit, and on the north, east and south by a line drawn from the city limit east along Montreal Road and Highway 17, north along Green&#x27;s Creek and due north to the Quebec boundary.
* the part of the Township of Cumberland west of Trim Road and north of Innes Road.

The name of the electoral district was changed in 1997 back to &quot;Carleton—Gloucester&quot;, and in 2000 to &quot;Ottawa—Orléans&quot;.

Following the 2012 redistribution of Canada&#x27;s ridings, the riding will lose the neighbourhood of Beacon Hill South from Ottawa—Vanier, and will gain the Cardinal Creek area from Glengarry—Prescott—Russell and the rural area surrounding Carlsbad Spring from parts of Glengarry—Prescott—Russell and Nepean—Carleton.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will lose Blackburn Hamlet to Ottawa—Vanier.

<doc id="846717" wikidata="Q13427559" url="?curid=846717" title="Return-to-libc attack">
<text>A &quot;return-to-libc&quot; attack is a computer security attack usually starting with a buffer overflow in which a subroutine return address on a call stack is replaced by an address of a subroutine that is already present in the process executable memory, bypassing the no-execute bit feature (if present) and ridding the attacker of the need to inject their own code. The first example of this attack in the wild was contributed by Alexander Peslyak on the Bugtraq mailing list in 1997.

On POSIX-compliant operating systems the C standard library (&quot;codice_1&quot;) is commonly used to provide a standard runtime environment for programs written in the C programming language. Although the attacker could make the code return anywhere, codice_1 is the most likely target, as it is almost always linked to the program, and it provides useful calls for an attacker (such as the codice_3 function used to execute shell commands).

==Protection from return-to-libc attacks==
A non-executable stack can prevent some buffer overflow exploitation, however it cannot prevent a return-to-libc attack because in the return-to-libc attack only existing executable code is used. On the other hand, these attacks can only call preexisting functions. Stack-smashing protection can prevent or obstruct exploitation as it may detect the corruption of the stack and possibly flush out the compromised segment.

&quot;ASCII armoring&quot; is a technique that can be used to obstruct this kind of attack. With ASCII armoring, all the system libraries (e.g., libc) addresses contain a NULL byte (codice_4). This is commonly done by placing them in the first codice_5 bytes of memory (a few pages more than 16 MB, dubbed the &quot;ASCII armor region&quot;), as every address up to (but not including) this value contains at least one NULL byte. This makes it impossible to emplace code containing those addresses using string manipulation functions such as codice_6. However, this technique does not work if the attacker has a way to overflow NULL bytes into the stack. If the program is too large to fit in the first 16 MB, protection may be incomplete. This technique is similar to another attack known as return-to-plt where, instead of returning to libc, the attacker uses the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) functions loaded in the position-independent code (e.g., codice_7).

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes this type of attack extremely unlikely to succeed on 64-bit machines as the memory locations of functions are random. For 32-bit systems, however, ASLR provides little benefit since there are only 16 bits available for randomization, and they can be defeated by brute force in a matter of minutes.

<text>The German term  (; pl.  ; derived from , &quot;circle&quot;) translated as &quot;district&quot; can refer to the following types of administrative divisions:

* , a subdivision of a city in the sense of a borough (e.g. in Berlin, Hamburg or Vienna), often again subdivided into several quarters and neighbourhoods. According to German &quot;Gemeindeordnung&quot; codes, the city council resolves upon the implementation by municipal by-law (&quot;Satzung&quot;). In some cities the have limited powers delegated to them by the city&#x27;s local government, including an assembly resulting from local elections and an own &#x27;mayor&#x27; (&quot;Bürgermeister&quot;). In the German states of Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate any municipality is authorized to implement &quot;Ortsbezirke&quot; with own advisory councils and local administrators. The state law in North Rhine-Westphalia commits the municipal administration of an independent city to subdivide the urban area into .
* In Austria, the word is used with different meanings in three different contexts:
** Some of the tasks of the administrative branch of the national and regional governments are fulfilled by the 95 district captaincies (&quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot;, also translated as &quot;district administrative office&quot;). The area a district administrative office is responsible for is often, although informally, called a district (). A number of statutory cities, currently 15, are not served by any district administrative office.

<text>The Government Actuary&#x27;s Department (GAD) provides actuarial solutions including risk analysis, modelling and advice to support the UK public sector. It is a department of the Government of the United Kingdom.

==History==
In 1912 the Government appointed a chief actuary to the National Health Insurance Joint Committee, following the Old Age Pensions Act 1908 and the National Insurance Act 1911. As the role of the Chief Actuary expanded, the post of Government Actuary was created in 1917. The Government Actuary&#x27;s Department was formed 2 years later.

The role of GAD within government expanded significantly in the 1940s and 1950s, coinciding with an expansion of the state&#x27;s role in pensions, social security and health care.

By the 1980s GAD had grown into a significant actuarial consultancy within government and in 1989 the financing of GAD through an annual Parliamentary vote of funds was replaced by a system of directly charging users of GAD&#x27;s services. The calculation of GAD&#x27;s fees is based solely on the recovery of its costs.

GAD has about 200 people across 2 offices (London and Edinburgh), of whom around 165 are actuaries and analysts.

==List of government actuaries==
The government actuary is the individual actuary that is responsible for the overall running and leadership of GAD. The holders of this role have been:

* Alfred Watson, 14 May 1917 – 7 May 1936
* George Epps, 19 May 1936 – 30 November 1944
* Percy Harvey, 1 December 1944 – 30 August 1946
* George Maddex, 31 August 1946 – 31 March 1958
* Herbert Tetley, 1 April 1958 – 30 April 1973
* Edward Johnston, 1 May 1973 – 14 April 1989

<doc id="846738" wikidata="Q1267112" url="?curid=846738" title="Sacred Heart Cathedral, Sarajevo">
<text>The Sacred Heart Cathedral (Serbo-Croatian: &quot;Katedrala Srca Isusova/Катедрала Срца Исусова&quot;) is a Catholic church in Sarajevo; commonly referred as the Sarajevo Cathedral (&quot;Sarajevska katedrala/Сарајевска катедрала&quot;), it is the largest cathedral in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Vrhbosna, currently Tomo Vukšić, and center of Catholic worship in the city. The cathedral is located in the city&#x27;s Old Town district.

==History==
Sacred Heart Cathedral was built in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, an important Catholic concept. The building is in the Neo-Gothic style, with Romanesque Revival elements. The building was awarded to the Viennese contractor Baron Karl Schwarz with supervising architect Josip Vancaš. He modeled it after the Notre-Dame in Dijon (France). Work began on 25 August 1884, and was completed on 9 November 1887. The Bishop of Dubrovnik was present for the consecration on 14 September 1889.
The building was damaged during the Siege of Sarajevo, but not completely destroyed, and the damage has since been repaired. The building is often considered as a symbol of the city: The design above the door to the cathedral is part of the flag and seal of Sarajevo Canton and the Romanesque towers are featured on the flag and coat of arms of Sarajevo.

==Exterior==
The cathedral is 41.9 meters long and 21.3 meter wide. It was constructed in Neo-Gothic style; The two bell towers are 43.2 m high. Above the portal is an octagonal rosette and a statue of the Sacred Heart.

==Interior==
* The main altar was designed by Josip Vancaš and made from Grisignano marble. It rests on four small columns of red Tyrolean marble. The seven niches behind the altar depict in the central position: Sacred Heart of Jesus; on the left side: Saint Joseph and Saint Francis of Assisi; on the right side: Saint Michael and the prophet Elijah; on the extremities: statue of an angel.
* Side altars: in the western aisle is an altar dedicated to the Immaculate Conception (a donation of Emperor Franz Joseph I). In the eastern aisle, an altar dedicated to the apostles of the Slavs, Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius (a donation of the people of Bohemia).
* Pulpit: the pulpit is mounted on a richly decorated pedestal. The enclosure shows in the central part Jesus as teacher, flanked on each side by two Evangelists.
* Frescoes: in 1886 the frescoes were commissioned to Alexander Maximilian Seitz (1811–1888). Due to his deteriorating health he could only finish the designs in 1887. The execution was undertaken by his assistant Alberto Rohden.
** on the wall of the western bell tower : the Coronation of Mary. The lower part of the fresco shows a father, mother and child in national dress, surrounded by Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Dominic.
** on the wall of the eastern bell tower: the Resurrection of Jesus.
** in the vault: a depiction of the Sermon on the Mount and a depiction of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments, both by Ante Martinović (replica on canvas of the fresco by A.M. Seitz).
** in the indentations above the vaults: oil paintings in chiaroscuro of the Doctors of the Church, done on canvas in Rome by Lodovico Seitz (1844-1908), son of Alexander Seitz.
* Organ: manufactured by the Heferer Company of Zagreb. It has mechanical tractions, two manuals, pedal and 22 sound registers.
* Grave of archbishop Stadler, the first archbishop of Vrhbosna by the sculptor Marin Studin.

<text>Hornchurch Country Park is a 104.5-hectare park on the former site of Hornchurch Airfield, south of Hornchurch in the London Borough of Havering, east London.

== Site ==
The River Ingrebourne passes through the park and if forms part of Thames Chase Community Forest. The most popular part of the park is to the west of the Ingrebourne, where the ground is flat and paved and frequently visited by dog walkers. The woodland to the east of the river is somewhat inaccessible. Some southern parts of the park that reach into Rainham have been historically used as landfill.

There is a fishing lake located within the park alongside many paths that connect neighbouring areas, such as Upminster, Dagenham and Rainham.

There are a number of Pillboxes and other historic installations dating from the Second World War to be found in the park.

The park is a Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade I. Almost all of it falls within the Ingrebourne Valley Local Nature Reserve, with the eastern edge forming part of the Ingrebourne Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest.

There is access from Airfield Way/Squadron&#x27;s Approach, off South End Road.

== COVID-19 Memorial Woodland ==

At a ceremony on 23 March 2022, the Mayor of Havering joined representatives of the Council, Borough, voluntary sector and families of the deceased to officially open the COVID-19 Memorial Woodland in the south of Hornchurch Country Park. The opening ceremony coincided with the National Day of Remembrance, marking the second anniversary of the first UK Lockdown.

The Memorial Woodland consists of over 4000 trees planted by volunteers, alongside sponsored memorial benches, wildflowers and a wetland area, aims to remember all those who lost their lives, the significant efforts and sacrifices of key workers and all that our communities endured throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The location of the memorial is significant as it is centrally located within the borough and acknowledges the role that parks played in supporting the mental and physical health of local residents during lockdowns.

Alongside honouring those who lost their lives during the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Memorial Woodland also contributes to fighting climate change and aiding local biodiversity. For example, a swale (a shallow dry channel) was included to combat flooding in the area, a variety of trees have been planted (including berrying and flowering species) to aid birds and insects, and grass rides were incorporated to create an excess of woodland edge, the ideal habitat for butterflies.

<doc id="846748" wikidata="Q110007" url="?curid=846748" title="Union Square, Manhattan">
<text>Union Square is a historic intersection and surrounding neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City, United States, located where Broadway and the former Bowery Road – now Fourth Avenue – came together in the early 19th century. Its name denotes that &quot;here was the union of the two principal thoroughfares of the island&quot;. The current Union Square Park is bounded by 14th Street on the south, 17th Street on the north, and Union Square West and Union Square East to the west and east respectively. 17th Street links together Broadway and Park Avenue South on the north end of the park, while Union Square East connects Park Avenue South to Fourth Avenue and the continuation of Broadway on the park&#x27;s south side. The park is maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

Adjacent neighborhoods are the Flatiron District to the north, Chelsea to the west, Greenwich Village to the southwest, East Village to the southeast, and Gramercy Park to the east. Many buildings of The New School are near the square, as are several dormitories of New York University. The eastern side of the square is dominated by the four Zeckendorf Towers, and the south side by the full-square-block mixed-use One Union Square South, which contains a wall sculpture and digital clock titled &quot;Metronome&quot;. Union Square Park also contains an assortment of art, including statues of George Washington, Marquis de Lafayette, Abraham Lincoln, and Mahatma Gandhi.

Union Square is part of Manhattan Community District 5 and its primary ZIP Code is 10003. It is patrolled by the 13th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. The New York City Subway&#x27;s 14th Street–Union Square station, served by the , is located under Union Square.

==History==
===Development===

Prior to the area&#x27;s settlement, the area around present-day Union Square was farmland. The western part of the site was owned by Elias Brevoort, who later sold his land to John Smith in 1762; by 1788 it had been sold again to Henry Spingler (or Springler). On the eastern part of the land were farms owned by John Watts and Cornelius Williams. The northwestern corner of the park site contained of land owned by the Manhattan Bank, which supposedly was a &quot;refuge&quot; for businesses during New York City&#x27;s yellow fever epidemics.

When John Randel was surveying the island in preparation for the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, the Bloomingdale Road (now Broadway) angled away from the Bowery at an acute angle. Because it would have been difficult to develop buildings upon this angle, the Commissioners decided to form a square at the union. In 1815, by act of the state legislature, this former potter&#x27;s field became a public commons for the city, at first named Union Place. Union Place originally was supposed to extend from 10th to 17th Streets. Several city officials objected that Union Place was too large and requested that it be &quot;discontinued&quot;, and in 1814, the New York State Legislature acted to downsize the area by making 14th Street the southern boundary.

===Mid-to-late 19th century===
====Residential neighborhood====

In 1831, at a time when the city was quickly expanding and the surrounding area was still sparsely developed, Samuel Ruggles, one of the founders of the Bank of Commerce and the developer of Gramercy Park to the northeast, convinced the city to rename the area &quot;Union Square&quot;. In doing so, Ruggles also got the city to enlarge the commons to 17th Street on the north and extend the axis of University Place to form the square&#x27;s west side, thus turning the common from a triangular to a rectangular area. By 1832, the area had been renamed Union Square. Ruggles obtained a fifty-year lease on most of the surrounding lots from 15th to 19th Streets, where he built sidewalks and curbs. In 1834, he convinced the Board of Aldermen to enclose and grade the square, then sold most of his leases and in 1839 built a four-story house facing the east side of the Square. The park at Union Square was completed and opened in July 1839.

A fountain was built in the center of Union Square to receive water from the Croton Aqueduct, completed in October 1842. In 1845, as the square finally began to fill with affluent houses, $116,000 was spent in paving the surrounding streets and planting the square, in part owing to the continued encouragement of Ruggles. The sole survivors of this early phase, though they have been much adapted and rebuilt, are a series of three- and four-story brick rowhouses, 862–866 Broadway, at the turn where Broadway exits the square at 17th Street. The Everett House on the corner of 17th Street and Fourth Avenue (built 1848, demolished 1908) was for decades one of the city&#x27;s most fashionable hotels. In the early years of the park, a fence surrounded the square&#x27;s central oval planted with radiating walks lined with trees. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, arrangements were made for the erection of the statue of Lincoln in the square. In 1872, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were called in to replant the park, as an open glade with clumps of trees.

Initially, the square was largely residential: the Union League Club first occupied a house loaned for the purpose by Henry G. Marquand at the corner of 17th Street and Broadway. After the Civil War the neighborhood became largely commercial, and the square began to lose social cachet at the turn of the twentieth century, with many of the old mansions being demolished. Tiffany &amp; Co., which had moved to the square from Broadway and Broome Street in 1870, left its premises on 15th Street to move uptown to 37th Street in 1905; the silversmiths Gorham Company moved up from 19th Street in 1906. The last of the neighborhood&#x27;s free-standing private mansions, Peter Goelet&#x27;s at the northeast corner of 19th Street, made way for a commercial building in 1897.

====The Rialto====
The Rialto, New York City&#x27;s first commercial theater district, was located in and around Union Square beginning in the 1870s. It was named after Venice&#x27;s Rialto, a commercial district. The first facility to open within the Union Square Rialto was the Academy of Music, which opened at Irving Place in 1854. The theater district gradually relocated northward, into less expensive and undeveloped uptown neighborhoods, and eventually into the current Theater District.

Before the Civil War, theatres in New York City were primarily located along Broadway and the Bowery up to 14th Street, with those on Broadway appealing more to the middle and upper classes and the Bowery theatres attracting immigrant audiences, clerks and the working class. After the war, the development of the Ladies&#x27; Mile shopping district along Fifth and Sixth Avenues above 14th Street had the effect of pulling the playhouses uptown, so that a &quot;Rialto&quot; theatrical strip came about on Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets, between Union Square and Madison Square.

At the same time, a transition from stock companies, in which a resident acting company was based around a star or impresario, to a &quot;combination&quot; system, in which productions were put together on a one-time basis to mount a specific play, expanded the amount of outside support needed to service the theatrical industry. Thus, suppliers of props, costumes, wigs, scenery, and other theatrical necessities grew up around the new theatres. The new system also needed an organized way to engage actors for these one-off productions, so talent brokers and theatrical agents sprang up, as did theatrical boardinghouses, stage photographers, publicity agencies, theatrical printers and play publishers. Along with the hotels and restaurants which serviced the theatregoers and shoppers of the area, the Union Square Rialto was, by the end of the century, a thriving theatrical neighborhood, which would soon nonetheless migrate uptown to what became known as &quot;Broadway&quot; as the Rialto became subsumed into the more vice-oriented Tenderloin entertainment district.

===Early 20th century===
====Office and wholesale district====

By the first decade of the 20th century, Union Square had grown into a major transportation hub with several elevated and surface railroad lines running nearby, and the New York City Subway&#x27;s 14th Street–Union Square station having opened in 1904. With the northward relocation of the theater district, Union Square also became a major wholesaling district with several loft buildings, as well as numerous office buildings. The office structures included the Everett Building, erected at the northwest corner of Park Avenue South and 17th Street in 1908; the Germania Life Insurance Company Building, erected at the northeast corner of the same intersection in 1910–1911; and the Consolidated Edison Building, constructed three blocks south at 14th Street between 1910 and 1914. Existing houses were also converted into stores, including a pair of merchants&#x27; houses on the east side of the park at 16th Street in 1916.

During this era, many of the older homes on Union Square were converted into tenements for immigrants and industrial workers. Numerous artists relocated into the attics of the remaining mansions along 14th Street, where they had their studios. The 1939 WPA Guide to New York City said that by the 1920s, the &quot;south side of Fourteenth Street became virtually an ex-tension of Greenwich Village&quot;. Further, real estate values around Union Square had declined by the 1920s, with &quot;burlesque houses, shooting galleries, and shoddy businesses&quot; lining the square. Throughout the decade, most buildings on the eastern part of the square were purchased by department stores S. Klein and Ohrbach&#x27;s. Real estate activity resumed in the late 1920s, and according to a 1928 piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, “several smaller operations are planned or are under way in the neighborhood&quot;. By then, at least eight banks had opened locations on the western and eastern sides of the park.

====1910s and 1920s renovation====

City officials announced in 1910 that they would install a firefighters&#x27; memorial near the northern end of the park. The same year, there was a failed proposal to construct a courthouse within the park. As part of the Dual Contracts, workers began constructing the 14th Street–Union Square station, on the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s Broadway Line, under the park in 1913. The station was built using an open cut method, and a strip of land, running diagonally through Union Square Park, was closed and excavated. By late 1913, large portions of Union Square Park had been demolished as part of the construction of the Broadway Line&#x27;s Union Square station. New York City&#x27;s parks commissioner promised members of the public that the park would be remodeled after the station was finished. The station had been completed by early 1916, and workers began restoring the section of Union Square Park above the 14th Street station.

The city&#x27;s park commissioner Francis D. Gallatin proposed relocating the park&#x27;s Washington, Lincoln, and Lafayette statues in 1922 to bring the Washington statue closer to the center of the park. A group of sculptors approved his proposal the same month. In 1927, the Municipal Art Society approved plans for a renovation of the park, which was to include a covered parking area at the north end of the park.

To make way for a further expansion of the Union Square subway station, the park was raised by about as part of a renovation during the late 1920s. The plans, announced in June 1929, also included relocating several statues and building a concert plaza with a bandstand at the park&#x27;s northern end. There were also plans to relocate the Washington statue to Washington Square Park, although this proposal was opposed. Although the city decided to keep the Washington statue in Union Square Park, the statue was relocated to the southeast corner to make way for a flagpole honoring former Tammany Hall leader Charles F. Murphy. Landscaping of the park was delayed by the construction of the subway mezzanine below it. The park&#x27;s renovation was nearly completed by mid-1931; the last construction contract, for the bandstand, was awarded that August. After building the bandstand, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation could not afford to landscape the park. As a result, civic groups started landscaping the park for free in June 1932.

===Late 20th century===
Most of the neighborhood&#x27;s largest retailers, such as Ohrbach&#x27;s and Hearn&#x27;s, had relocated by the 1950s, and the area began to decline. One of the last major retailers on Union Square, S. Klein, closed in 1975. The S. Klein site remained vacant until 1983, when William Zeckendorf leased the site for the Zeckendorf Towers development. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote at the time, &quot;The former S. Klein store, boarded up since 1975, is a melancholy monument to a once-thriving commercial district.&quot;

In 1982, a $1.5 million refurbishment of Union Square Park was announced. At the time, the park was frequented by drug users because of its tall hedges, and many of the benches, lights, and statues had been vandalized. The first phase of the renovation, which cost $3.6 million, was completed in May 1985. The renovations included removing hedges, increasing lighting, and erecting new subway entrances. The renovation of Union Square, along with the construction of the Zeckendorf Towers, caused real-estate values in the area to increase. By 1987, there were plans to close off two blocks of the little-used Union Square West to make way for an expansion of the park. This plan was not carried out at the time due to a lack of funds. When the idea of closing Union Square West was again proposed in 1996, local business owners opposed the proposal because the park had become extremely popular, causing vehicular traffic in the neighborhood to increase significantly. Union Square was named a National Historic Landmark in 1997, primarily to honor it as the site of the first Labor Day parade. Mayor Rudy Giuliani announced plans in early 1998 to spend $2.6 million on expanding the park, following advocacy from area residents. The expansion consisted of a pocket park in a traffic island at the southeast corner of Union Square, which was completed in 2000.

===21st century===

Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Union Square became a primary public gathering point for mourners. People created spontaneous candle and photograph memorials in the park and vigils were held to honor the victims. At the time, non-emergency vehicles were temporarily banned and pedestrian travel was restricted in Lower Manhattan below 14th Street.

In March 2008, an eighteen-month renovation began on the northern end of the park. The renovation was controversial because of disagreements over whether to place a restaurant in the pavilion at the north end of the park. A New York Supreme Court judge approved the renovation of the park&#x27;s north end in April 2008 but placed an injunction temporarily banning the city from renovating the pavilion. In early 2009, a judge dismissed the lawsuit against the renovation, allowing a seasonal restaurant in the pavilion. CMS Architecture and Design was hired in 2011 to design the restaurant in the pavilion. The Pavilion restaurant opened in Union Square Park in May 2014, following years of disputes.

In 2021, the Union Square Partnership proposed spending $100 million to overhaul Union Square. The plan entailed closing off adjacent streets to increase the park&#x27;s size by 33%, as well as adding benches and lighting, improving restrooms, and refurbishing a dog run in the park itself.

In addition, the Consolidated Edison Building is located one block east of the Zeckendorf Towers. The Century Association clubhouse is located on 15th Street between Irving Place and Union Square East.

==Art and sculpture==

Union Square contains a large equestrian statue of U.S. President George Washington, modeled by Henry Kirke Brown and unveiled in 1856. Located at the south end of the park, it was the first public sculpture erected in New York City since the equestrian statue of George III in 1770, and the first American equestrian sculpture cast in bronze.

The &quot;Marquis de Lafayette&quot;, at Union Square East and 16th Street, was modeled by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and dedicated in 1876, the 100th anniversary of U.S. independence.

The statue of Abraham Lincoln, modeled by Henry Kirke Brown (1870), is located near the north end of the park.

A statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the southwest corner of the park was added in 1986.

The &quot;Union Square Drinking Fountain&quot; (1881) near Union Square West, also known as the James Fountain, is a Temperance fountain with the figure of Charity who empties her jug of water, aided by a child. It was donated by Daniel Willis James and sculpted by Adolf Donndorf.

The Charles F. Murphy Memorial Flagpole, also known as the Independence Flagstaff, was cast in 1926 and dedicated in 1930 to mark the 150th anniversary of U.S. independence. It is located in the center of the park.

In October 2023, an outdoor version of the sculpture &quot;N.Y.C. Legend&quot; by the Swedish artist Alexander Klingspor, featuring a New York sewer alligator, was unveiled in the square by Queen Silvia of Sweden.

A double line of trees is planted along 17th Street, and a corresponding plaque installed nearby, as a monument to victims of the Armenian genocide.

==Greenmarkets and businesses==
===Public markets===
In 1976, the Council on the Environment of New York City (now GrowNYC) established the Greenmarket program, which provided regional small-family farmers with opportunities to sell their fruits, vegetables and other farm products at open-air markets in the city. There were originally seven farmers at the first Greenmarket, and their selection sold out by noon. That summer, two more markets opened in New York City. Despite some backlash from local merchants and supermarkets who believed the Greenmarket was cutting into their profits, more markets opened in the city.

Today, the Union Square Greenmarket, the best known of the markets, is held year-round on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays between 8 am and 6 pm. The market is served by a number of regional farmers, as the average distance between farmers and the market is . During peak seasons, the Greenmarket serves more than 250,000 customers per week, who purchase more than one thousand varieties of fruits and vegetables can be found at the Greenmarket; and the variety of produce available is much broader than what is found in a conventional supermarket.

Union Square hosts the Union Square Holiday Market every November and December, in which more than 150 vendors sell handcrafts. Around two million people visit the Holiday Market annually. Starting in 2024, UrbanSpace also hosted the Night Market food market in Union Square during the summer.

===Businesses===

Union Square is a popular meeting place, given its central location in Manhattan and its many nearby subway routes. There are many bars and restaurants on the periphery of the square, and the surrounding streets have some of the city&#x27;s most renowned (and expensive) restaurants. S. Klein&#x27;s department store promoted itself in the mid-20th century as an &quot;On the Square&quot; alternative to higher prices uptown, and late in the century several big-box chain stores established a presence, including Barnes &amp; Noble in the Century Building, Babies &quot;R&quot; Us in the former United States Communist Party headquarters, and Staples in the Spingler Building.

The W New York Union Square, part of the W Hotels chain, is located at the park&#x27;s northeast corner, in the former Guardian Life building. Additionally, the Hyatt Union Square New York hotel is located at the park&#x27;s southeast corner, in a former post office.

==Cultural impact==

===Social and political activism===
The park has historically been the start or the end point for many political demonstrations. Although the park was known for its labor union rallies and for the large 1861 gathering in support of Union troops, it was actually named for its location at the &quot;union&quot; of Bloomingdale Road (now Broadway) and the former Bowery Road decades before these gatherings. On April 20, 1861, soon after the fall of Fort Sumter, Major Robert Anderson, who was the commander of Fort Sumter brought the Fort Sumter Flag that flew at the fort to the park. The flag was flown from the George Washington statue, gathering patriotic rally of perhaps a quarter of a million people that is thought to have been the largest public gathering in North America up to that time. The flag was shortly removed after to be used as a patriotic fundraiser by being auctioned across the country repeatedly. In the summer of 1864 the north side of the square was the site of the Metropolitan Fair.

Union Square has been a frequent gathering point for radicals of all stripes to make speeches or demonstrate. In 1865, the recently formed Irish republican Fenian Brotherhood came out publicly and rented Dr. John Moffat&#x27;s brownstone rowhouse at 32 East 17th Street, next to the Everett House hotel facing the north side of the square, for the capitol of the government-in-exile they declared. On September 5, 1882, in the first Labor Day celebration, a crowd of at least 10,000 workers paraded up Broadway and filed past the reviewing stand at Union Square. On March 28, 1908, an anarchist set off a bomb in Union Square which only killed himself and another man.

In 1893, Emma Goldman took the stage at Union Square to make her &quot;Free Bread&quot; speech to a crowd of overworked garment workers. She also addressed a crowd in 1916 on the need for free access to birth control, which was banned by the Comstock laws. Her visits to Union Square pulled hundreds of followers; some of these rallies resulted in her arrest.

Union Square has been used as a platform to raise awareness about the Black Lives Matter movement, such as during the George Floyd protests in New York City in 2020.

The Square&#x27;s shopping district saw strikes in the S. Klein and Ohrbach department stores in 1934. White collar workers were among the worst paid in Great Depression-era New York City, with union memberships being highly discouraged by store managers and often seen as fireable offenses. These strikes often involved acts of disobedience by the workers as many of them did not want to lose their jobs. This period saw Union Square as a gathering point for many of the city&#x27;s socialist and communist groups. The centennial of Union Square was seen as a thinly veiled effort to displace those elements with its draping of the square with flags and police demonstrations of anti protester drills.

===Street chess===

&quot;The Villager&quot;, a local newspaper, reported in 2013 that most of the street chess players at Washington Square Park—where Bobby Fischer had played—had moved their games to Union Square because the latter had more foot traffic. Street chess players play fast chess with passers-by for three to five dollars a game, with time controls of five minutes on each side being the most common. Writer Lauren Snetiker at the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation also documents this migration of the historical Washington Square Park chess scene to Union Square, noting the &quot;dozens of chess players [who] sit on crates and bring their own boards... as there are no permanent ones like there are in Washington Square Park&quot;.

===Freestyle Hip-Hop===
Union Square is the site of a regular hip-hop freestyle rap cypher called Legendary Cyphers since 2012. The events draw residents from across the city and tourists and encourage participation in freestyle hip-hop. Notable local hip-hop artists such as Joey Bada$$ have attended in the past.

==Union Square Partnership==
The Union Square Partnership (USP), a business improvement district (BID) and a local development corporation (LDC), was formed in 1984 and became a model for other BIDs in New York City. Jennifer E. Falk became its executive director in January 2007.

The Union Square Partnership provides a free public Wi-Fi network in Union Square.

==Education==
The Washington Irving Campus at 40 Irving Place between East 16th and 17th Streets, a block east of Union Square Park, was formerly the location of a comprehensive high school, but now houses Gramercy Arts High School, the High School for Language and Diplomacy, the International High School at Union Square, the Union Square Academy for Health Sciences and the Academy for Software Engineering. In 2012, Success Academy Charter Schools announced its plan to open an elementary school in the building, and an elementary school opened there the next year.

<doc id="846755" wikidata="Q11357162" url="?curid=846755" title="Mitsubishi Bank">
<text>The was a major Japanese bank headquartered in Tokyo, founded in 1880. For much of the 20th century it was one of the largest Japanese banks, together with Dai-Ichi Bank, Mitsui Bank, Sumitomo Bank, and Yasuda / Fuji Bank. It served as the main bank for the Mitsubishi conglomerate. In 1948, the Mitsubishi conglomerate was dismantled and the bank was renamed after the Chiyoda district in Tokyo, then reverted to the Mitsubishi name in 1953.

Mitsubishi Bank merged with the Bank of Tokyo in 1996 to form Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, a predecessor of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.

==Overview==

The bank&#x27;s operations date to 1880, when Mitsubishi group founder Yataro Iwasaki established the in Tokyo. Mitsubishi acquired the business of the Tokyo, Oita and Hakodate-based 119th National Bank in 1885, and spun this business off to an independent Mitsubishi Bank in 1919. The bank opened branches in London and New York in 1920. By 1929, Mitsubishi Bank had only 3 offices outside of Japan and its colonies, less than Mitsui bank or Sumitomo Bank and much less than the Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chōsen and Bank of Taiwan, for which foreign trade was part of a public-interest mandate under special legislation.

During World War II, Mitsubishi Bank was a financier of Japanese interests in Manchuria through its branch in Dalian, opened in 1933. Its London and New York offices closed during the war, but reopened in 1953.

In 1969, Mitsubishi and Dai-Ichi Bank, Japan&#x27;s oldest bank, began preparations for a merger, which would have led to a major regrouping in the bank-led &quot;keiretsu&quot; system of the era. But the plan met opposition among Dai-Ichi&#x27;s management and its customers in the Furukawa and Kawasaki groups, who feared that Mitsubishi would dominate the combined bank and that their businesses would be absorbed by the relatively strong Mitsubishi group. As a result, the merger was called off. Two years later, Dai-Ichi merged with Nippon Kangyo Bank to form Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.

Mitsubishi was known as a very conservative lender and was one of the few Japanese banks to emerge from the Japanese asset price bubble relatively unscathed. It acquired the Nippon Trust Bank in 1994. In 1996, it combined with The Bank of Tokyo to form The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

In addition to its home country of Japan, Mitsubishi was also active in California, where it began banking operations in 1972 through Mitsubishi Bank of California. Mitsubishi Bank acquired Bank of California in 1984, which later merged with Bank of Tokyo-controlled Union Bank to form what was later known as MUFG Union Bank.

<doc id="846757" wikidata="Q1183649" url="?curid=846757" title="Deccan sultanates">
<text>The Deccan sultanates is a historiographical term referring to five late medieval to early modern Indian kingdoms on the Deccan Plateau between the Krishna River and the Vindhya Range that were created from the disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate and ruled by Muslim dynasties: namely Ahmadnagar, Berar, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. The five sultanates owed their existence to the declaration of independence of Ahmadnagar in 1490, which was followed by Bijapur and Berar in the same year. Bidar became independent in , and Golconda in 1512.

Although the five sultanates were all ruled by Muslims, their founders were of diverse origins: the Nizam Shahi dynasty, the ruling family of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, was founded by Malik Hasan Bahri, a Deccani Muslim of Brahmin origin; the Berar Sultanate by a Kannadiga Hindu Brahmin slave brought up as a Deccani Muslim; the Bidar Sultanate was founded by a Georgian slave; the Bijapur Sultanate was founded by a foreigner who may have been a Georgian slave purchased by Mahmud Gawan; and the Golconda Sultanate was of Iranian Turkmen origin.

All the Deccan sultanates based their legitimacy as the successor states of the Bahmani Sultanate, and continued to use Bahmanid coins rather than issue their own coins. Although generally rivals, the sultanates did ally with each other against the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, permanently weakening Vijayanagara in the Battle of Talikota. Notably, the alliance destroyed the entire city of Vijayanagara, with important temples being razed to the ground.

In 1574, after a coup in Berar, Ahmadnagar invaded and conquered it. In 1619, Bidar was annexed by Bijapur. The sultanates were later conquered by the Mughal Empire: Berar was stripped from Ahmadnagar in 1596; Ahmadnagar was completely taken between 1616 and 1636; and Golconda and Bijapur were conquered by Aurangzeb&#x27;s 1686–87 campaign.
==Ahmadnagar Sultanate==

The Ahmadnagar Sultanate was founded by Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I, who was the son of Nizam ul-Mulk Malik Hasan Bahri, who was prominent in Bahmanid politics as the leader of the Deccani Muslim party at the court. Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri was a military slave, formerly a Hindu Brahmin from Vijayanagar originally named Timapa who converted to Islam, although the Brahmin lineage might have been a genealogical topos rather than fact, which, along with military training, Persian education and conversion by patronage, was meant to share with the origin of the Bahmanid dynasty. He became the regent of Muhammad Shah Bahmani after the former had devised the execution of Mahmud Gawan. As the head of the Sunni Deccani party, Nizam-ul-Mulk lead the wholescale massacre of the Shia foreigners, especially the Turks and Georgian population in Bidar, by the orders of the Bahmani Sultan. After the politically charged murder of Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri, and frustrated with the weakened Bahmani Sultan and the factionalised administration at Bidar, the outrated son, Ahmad Nizam Shah, the governor of Junnar, defeated the Bahmani army led by general Jahangir Khan on 28 May 1490, declared independence and established dynastic rule over Ahmadnagar. The territory of the sultanate was located in the northwestern Deccan, between the sultanates of Gujarat and Bijapur. Initially, his capital was in Junnar. In 1494, the foundation was laid for the new capital of Ahmadnagar. Malik Ahmed Shah, after several attempts, secured the fortress of Daulatabad in 1499.

After Malik Ahmed Shah&#x27;s death in 1510, his son Burhan, a boy of seven, was installed in his place. In 1538, under the influence of Shah Tahir, an Imam, he would establish Nizari Shi&#x27;ism as the state religion. Burhan Shah I died in Ahmadnagar in 1553. He left six sons, of whom Hussain succeeded him. After the death of Hussain Shah I in 1565, his son Murtaza (a minor) ascended the throne. While Murtaza was a child, his mother, Khanzada Humayun Sultana, ruled as a regent for several years. Murtaza Shah annexed Berar in 1574. On his death in 1588, his son Miran Hussain ascended the throne; but his reign lasted only a little more than ten months, as he was poisoned. Ismail, a cousin of Miran Hussain was raised to the throne, but the actual power was in the hands of Jamal Khan, the leader of the Deccani group in the court. He led the massacre of foreign nobles at Ahmadnagar, causing all the Persian nobles to flee and take service at Bijapur, including the historian Firishta himself.

&quot;There were massacres (&quot;qatl-e &#x27;ām&quot;) twice in the city, in the course of which not a single person from abroad was left alive. The killing spree lasted for three days. Good people like learned men and traders, who had assembled here in this period, were all slain, and their houses were destroyed.&quot;
Jamal Khan also enforced the Mahdawi religion on the state. He was killed in the battle of Rohankhed in 1591 and soon Ismail Shah was also captured and confined by his father Burhan, who ascended the throne as Burhan Shah II. He reinstated Shia Islam as the state religion. After the death of Burhan Shah, his eldest son Ibrahim ascended the throne. Ibrahim Shah died only after a few months in a battle with the Bijapur Sultanate. Soon, Chand Bibi, the aunt of Ibrahim Shah, proclaimed Bahadur, the infant son of Ibrahim Shah, as the rightful Sultan; and she became regent. In 1596, a Mughal attack led by Murad was repulsed by Chand Bibi.

After the death of Chand Bibi in July 1600, Ahmadnagar was conquered by the Mughals, and Bahadur Shah was imprisoned. But Malik Ambar, and other Ahmadnagar officials, defied the Mughals and declared Murtaza Shah II as sultan in 1600 at a new capital, Paranda. Malik Ambar became prime minister and &quot;vakīl-us-saltanat&quot; of Ahmadnagar. Later, the capital was shifted first to Junnar and then to a new city called Khadki (later Aurangabad). After the death of Malik Ambar, his son Fath Khan surrendered to the Mughals in 1633 and handed over the young Nizam Shahi ruler Hussain Shah, who was sent as a prisoner to the fort of Gwalior. In a last stand, Shahaji, with the assistance of Bijapur, placed an infant scion of the Nizam Shahi dynasty, Murtaza, on the throne but acted as regent. In 1636, Aurangzeb, the Mughal viceroy of Deccan, finally annexed the sultanate to the Mughal empire, after defeating Shahaji.

==Berar Sultanate==

The Berar Sultanate was founded by Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk, who was born a Kannadiga Hindu, but was captured as a boy by Bahmani forces, which were on an expedition against the Vijayanagara empire, and reared as a Muslim. In 1490, during the disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate, Imad-ul-Mulk, then governor of Berar, declared independence and founded the Imad Shahi dynasty of the Berar Sultanate. He established the capital at Achalpur (Ellichpur), and Gavilgad and Narnala were also fortified by him.

Upon his death in 1504, Imad-ul-Mulk was succeeded by his eldest son, Ala-ud-din. In 1528, Ala-ud-din resisted the aggression of Ahmadnagar with help from Bahadur Shah, Sultan of Gujarat. The next ruler of Berar, Darya, first tried to ally with Bijapur, to prevent the aggression of Ahmadnagar, but was unsuccessful. Later, he helped Ahmednagar on three occasions against Bijapur. After his death in 1562, his infant son Burhan succeeded him; but early in Burhan&#x27;s reign Tufal Khan, one of his ministers, usurped the throne. In 1474, Murtaza I, Sultan of Ahmadnagar, annexed Berar to his sultanate. Burhan, Tufal Khan, and Tufal&#x27;s son Shamshir-ul-Mulk, were taken to Ahmadnagar and confined to a fortress where all of them subsequently died.

==Bidar Sultanate==
Bidar was the smallest of the five Deccan sultanates. The Sultanate was founded by Qasim Barid I, who was Georgian enslaved by Turks. He joined the service of Bahmani ruler Mahmud Shah Bahmani () as a &quot;sar-naubat&quot; (commander), and later became a &quot;mir-jumla&quot; (governor) of the Bahmani Sultanate. In 1492, he became de facto ruler of Bahmani, although Sultan Mahmud Shah Bahmani remained as the nominal ruler.

After Mahmud Shah Bahmani&#x27;s death in 1504, his son Amir Barid controlled the administration of the Bahmani Sultanate. In 1528, with the flight of the last Bahmani ruler, Kalimullah, from Bidar, Amir Barid became practically an independent ruler. Amir Barid was succeeded by his son Ali Barid, who was the first to assume the title of &quot;shah&quot;. Ali Barid participated in the Battle of Talikota and was fond of poetry and calligraphy.

The last ruler of the Bidar Sultanate, Amir Barid Shah III, was defeated in 1619, and the sultanate was annexed to the Bijapur Sultanate.

==Bijapur Sultanate==

Located in southwestern India, straddling the Western Ghats range of southern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka, the Bijapur Sultanate was ruled by the Adil Shahi dynasty from 1490 to 1686. The founder of the dynasty, Yusuf Adil Shah, may have been a Georgian slave who was purchased by Mahmud Gawan. Other historians mentioned him of Persian or Turkmen origin. Yusuf was originally a provincial governor of the Bahmani Sultanate; in 1490, he attained de facto independence. In 1510, a Portuguese colonial expedition succeeded in conquering the Adil Shahi port of Goa. Ismail Adil Shah, Yusuf&#x27;s son, and his successors embellished the capital at Bijapur with numerous monuments.

Ibrahim Adil Shah I switched to a Deccani Muslim identity, and converted strongly to Sunni Islam, the religion of the Deccani Muslims. He deviated from the traditions of his predecessor and introduced many innovations in the political and religious policies, discontinuing previous Shia practices and restoring the exercise of the Sunni Islamic practices. He degraded most of the Afaqi (foreign) faction (with a few exceptions), and in their place enrolled the Deccani Muslims to services. Consequently, he brought Sunni Muslims to power and ended Shia domination by dismissing them from their posts

The Adil Shahis fought the Vijayanagara Empire, which lay to the south, across the Tungabhadra River, but fought the other Deccan sultanates as well. Four of the five sultanates combined forces to decisively defeat Vijayanagara at the Battle of Talikota in 1565. After the battle, the empire broke up, and Bijapur seized control of the Raichur Doab. In 1619, the Adil Shahis conquered the neighbouring sultanate of Bidar, which was incorporated into their realm.

Later in the 17th century, the Marathas revolted successfully under Shivaji&#x27;s leadership, captured major parts of the sultanate, and its capital, Bijapur. The weakened sultanate was conquered by Aurangzeb in 1686 with the fall of Bijapur, bringing the dynasty to an end.

==Golconda Sultanate==

The dynasty&#x27;s founder, Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk, migrated to Delhi from Persia with some of his relatives and friends in the beginning of the 16th century. Later he migrated south to the Deccan and served the Bahmani Sultan Mohammed Shah I. Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk conquered Golconda and became the governor of the Telangana region in 1518, after the disintegration of the Bahmani sultanate. Soon after, he declared his independence and took the title of &quot;Qutb Shah&quot;.

The dynasty ruled for 175 years, until the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s army besieged and conquered Golconda in 1687.

==Cultural contributions==
The rulers of the Deccan sultanates made a number of cultural contributions in the fields of literature, art, architecture, and music.

An important contribution was the development of the Dakhani language, which, having started development under the Bahamani rulers, developed into an independent spoken and literary language during this period by continuously borrowing from Arabic-Persian, Marathi, Kannada, and Telugu. Dakhani later became known as Dakhani Urdu to distinguish it from North Indian Urdu.

Deccani miniature painting—which flourished in the courts of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda—is another major cultural contribution of the Deccan sultanates.

Architectural splendors of the Deccan such as Charminar and Gol Gumbaz belong to this period. A number of monuments built by the Deccan Sultanates are on a tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The religious tolerance displayed by the Nizam Shahi, Adil Shahi, and Qutb Shahi rulers is also worthy of mention.

===Ahmadnagar===

The Nizam Shahi rulers of Ahmadnagar enthusiastically patronised miniature painting, the earliest surviving of which are found as the illustrations of the manuscript &quot;Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi&quot; (c. 1565), which is now in the Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pune. A miniature painting of Murtaza Nizam Shah (c. 1575) is in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, while another one is in the Raza Library in Rampur. The &quot;Running Elephant&quot; is in an American private collection, the &quot;Royal Picnic&quot; is in the India Office Library in London, and the &quot;Young Prince Embraced by a Small Girl&quot;, most likely belonging to the Burhan Nizam Shah II period, is in the Edwin Binney 3rd Collection of South Asian Works in the San Diego Museum of Art.

The earliest notable architecture of the Nizam Shahi rulers of Ahmadnagar is the tomb of Ahmad Shah I Bahri (1509), at the centre of Bagh Rouza, a garden complex. The Jami Masjid also belongs to the same period. The Mecca Masjid, built in 1525 by Rumi Khan, a Turkish artillery officer of Burhan Nizam Shah I, is original in its design. The Kotla complex was constructed in 1537 as a religious educational institution. The impressive Farah Bagh was the centrepiece of a large palatial complex completed in 1583. Other monuments in Ahmednagar of the Nizam Shahi period are the Do Boti Chira (tomb of Sharja Khan, 1562), Damri Masjid (1568), and the tomb of Rumi Khan (1568). The Jami Masjid (1615) in Khirki (Aurangabad) and the Chini Mahal inside the Daulatabad fort were constructed during the late Nizam Shahi period (1600–1636). The tomb of Malik Ambar in Khuldabad (1626) is another impressive monument of this period. The Kali Masjid of Jalna (1578) and the tomb of Dilawar Khan (1613) in Rajgurunagar also belong to this period.

During the reign of Ahmad Shah I Bahri, his keeper of imperial records, Dalapati, wrote an encyclopedic work, the &quot;Nrisimha Prasada&quot;, where he mentioned his overlord as &quot;Nizamsaha&quot;. It is a notable instance of the religious tolerance of the Nizam Shahi rulers.

===Berar===
The ruined palace of &quot;Hauz Katora&quot;, west of Achalpur, is the only notable surviving Imad Shahi monument.

===Bidar===

The main architectural activities for the Barid Shahi rulers were building garden tombs. The tomb of Ali Barid Shah (1577) is the most notable monument in Bidar. The tomb consists of a lofty domed chamber, open on four sides, located in the middle of a Persian four-square garden. The &quot;Rangin Mahal&quot; in Bidar, built during the reign of Ali Barid Shah, is a complete and exquisitely decorated courtly structure. Other important monuments in Bidar from this period are the tomb of Qasim II and the Kali Masjid.

An important class of metalwork known as Bidriware originated in Bidar. This metalwork consists of a black metal, usually a zinc alloy, inlaid with intricate designs in silver, brass, and sometimes copper.

===Bijapur===

The Adil Shahi rulers contributed greatly to architecture, art, literature, and music, as Bijapur developed into a cosmopolitan city under their rule and attracted many scholars, artists, musicians, and Sufi saints from Rome, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Turkestan. The Adil Shahi kings were known for their tolerance towards Hindus and non-interference in their religious matters. They employed Hindus to high posts, especially as officers overseeing accounts and administration, whose documents were maintained in Marathi.

Amongst the major architectural works in the Bijapur Sultanate, one of the earliest is the unfinished Jami Masjid, which was begun by Ali Adil Shah I in 1576. It has an arcaded prayer hall, with fine aisles, and has an impressive dome supported by massive piers. One of the most impressive monuments built during the reign of Ibrahim II was the Ibrahim Rouza which was originally planned as a tomb for queen Taj Sultana, but was later converted into the tomb for Ibrahim Adil Shah II and his family. This complex, completed in 1626, consists of a paired tomb and mosque. Ibrahim II also planned to construct a new twin city to Bijapur, Nauraspur, whose construction began in 1599 but was never completed. The greatest monument in Bijapur is the Gol Gumbaz, the mausoleum of Muhammad Adil Shah, which was completed in 1656, and whose hemispherical dome measures across. The other important architectural works from this period are the &quot;Chini Mahal&quot;, the &quot;Jal Mandir&quot;, the &quot;Sat Manzil&quot;, the &quot;Gagan Mahal&quot;, the &quot;Anand Mahal&quot;, and the &quot;Asar Mahal&quot; (1646), all in Bijapur, as well as the &quot;Kummatgi&quot; ( from Bijapur), the Panhala Fort ( from Kolhapur), and Naldurg Fort ( from Solapur).

Persian artists of the Adil Shahi court have left a rare treasure of miniature paintings, some of which are well preserved in Europe&#x27;s museums. The earliest miniature paintings are ascribed to the period of Ali Adil Shah I. The most significant of them are the paintings in the manuscript of &quot;Nujum-ul-Ulum&quot; (Stars of Science) (1570), kept in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, which contains about 400 miniature paintings. Two other illustrated manuscripts from the period of Ali Adil Shah I are &quot;Jawahir-al Musiqat-i-Muhammadi&quot; in the British Library, which contains 48 paintings, and a Marathi commentary of Sarangadeva&#x27;s &quot;Sangita Ratnakara&quot; kept in the museum of City Palace, Jaipur, which contains 4 paintings. But the most miniature paintings come from the time of Sultan Ibrahim Adil Shah II. One of the most celebrated painters of his court was Maulana Farrukh Hussain. The miniature paintings of this period are preserved in the Bikaner Palace, the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Muśee Guimet in Paris, the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersberg, and the Náprstek Museum in Prague.

Under the Adil Shahi rulers many literary works were published in Dakhani. Ibrahim Adil Shah II himself wrote a book of songs, &quot;Kitab-i-Nauras&quot;, in Dakhani. This book contains a number of songs whose tunes are set to different &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;raginis&quot;. In his songs, he praised the Hindu goddess Sarasvati along with Muhammad and Sufi saint Khwaja Banda Nawaz Gesudaraz. A unique &quot;tambur&quot; (lute) known as Moti Khan was in his possession. The famous Persian poet laureate Muhammad Zuhuri was his court poet. The &quot;Mushaira&quot; (poetic symposium) was born in the Bijapur court and later travelled north.

===Golconda===


Qutb Shahi rulers appointed Hindus in important administrative posts. Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah appointed Murari Rao as &quot;Peshwa&quot;, second to only &quot;Mir Jumla&quot; (prime minister).

One of the earliest architectural achievements of the Qutb Shahi dynasty is the fortified city of Golconda, which is now in ruins. The nearby Qutb Shahi tombs are also noteworthy. In the 16th century, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah decided to shift the capital to Hyderabad, east of Golconda. Here, he constructed the most original monument in the Deccan, the Charminar, in the heart of the new city. This monument, completed in 1591, has four minarets, each . The construction of the Mecca Masjid, located immediately south of the Charminar, was started in 1617, during the reign of Muhammad Qutb Shah, but completed only in 1693. The other important monuments of this period are the Toli Masjid, Shaikpet Sarai, Khairtabad Mosque, Taramati Baradari, Hayat Bakshi Mosque, and the Jama Masjid at Gandikota.

The Qutb Shahi rulers invited many Persian artists, such as Shaykh Abbasi and Muhammad Zaman, to their court, whose art made a profound impact on the miniature paintings of this period. The earliest miniature paintings were the 126 illustrations in the manuscript of &quot;Anwar-i-Suhayli&quot; (c. 1550–1560) in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The illustrations &quot;Sindbad Namah&quot; in the India Office Library and &quot;Shirin and Khusrau&quot; in the Khudabaksh Library in Patna most probably belong to the reign of Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah. The 5 illustrations in a manuscript of the &quot;Diwan-i-Hafiz&quot; (c. 1630) in the British Museum, London, belong to the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. The most outstanding surviving Golconda painting probably is the &quot;Procession of Sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah Riding an Elephant&quot; (c. 1650) in the Saltykov-Shtshedrine State Public Library in St. Petersberg. Their painting style lasted even after the dynasty was extinct and evolved into the Hyderabad style.

The Qutb Shahi rulers were great patrons of literature and invited many scholars, poets, historians and Sufi saints from Iran to settle in their sultanate. The sultans patronised literature in Persian as well as Telugu, the local language. However, the most important contribution of the Golconda Sultanate in the field of literature is the development of the Dakhani language. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah was not only a great patron of art and literature but also a poet of a high order. He wrote in Dakhani, Persian, and Telugu and left an extensive &quot;Diwan&quot; (collection of poetry) in Dakhani, known as &quot;Kulliyat-i-Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah&quot;. Apart from the praise of God and the Prophet, he also wrote on nature, love and contemporary social life. Kshetrayya and Bhadrachala Ramadasu are some notable Telugu poets of this period.

The Qutb Shahi rulers were much more liberal than their other Muslim counterparts. During the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah, in 1634, the ancient Indian sex manual Koka Shastra was translated into Persian and named &quot;Lazzat-un-Nisa&quot; (Flavors of the Woman).

<doc id="846759" wikidata="Q16969734" url="?curid=846759" title="Liberalism in the United Kingdom">
<text>In the United Kingdom, the word liberalism can have any of several meanings. Scholars primarily use the term to refer to &quot;classical liberalism. &quot;The term can also mean &quot;economic liberalism&quot;, &quot;social liberalism&quot; or &quot;political liberalism.&quot; It can simply refer to the ideology and practises of the historic Liberal Party (1859–1988), or in the modern context, of the Liberal Democrats, a UK party formed after the original Liberal Party&#x27;s demise. 

Liberalism can occasionally have the imported American meaning; however, the pejorative connotation is much weaker in the UK than in the US, and social liberals from both the left and right wing continue to use &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;illiberal&quot; to describe themselves and their opponents, respectively.

== Background ==
Historically, the term referred to the broad liberal political alliance of the nineteenth century, formed by Whigs, Peelites, and radicals. This alliance, which developed into the Liberal Party, dominated politics for much of the Victorian era and during the years before the First World War.

British liberalism is now organised between two schools;
# the social liberalism of the Liberal Democrats (member LI, ALDE) and their counterpart the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (member LI, ALDE),
# and the classical liberalism of the Conservative Party which was adopted in the late 1970s by the late former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher whose fundamental changes to party policy aligned it to classical liberalism with its commitment to low taxation and economic deregulation. In his speech to the party conference in 2006, David Cameron described the party as a &quot;liberal conservative&quot; party, and in a speech in Bath on Thursday 22 March 2007, he described himself as a &quot;liberal Conservative&quot;.

In addition, The Economist magazine, based in Britain and with an international audience, claims to be &quot;liberal&quot; and regrets the split between the two schools.

==Gladstone==

William Ewart Gladstone (1809–1898) dominated liberalism and the Liberal Party in the late 19th century. He served for 12 years as prime minister, spread over four terms beginning in 1868 and ending in 1894. He also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer four times and between terms was usually the minority leader. The historian H. C. G. Matthew states that Gladstone&#x27;s chief legacy lay in three areas: his financial policy; his support for Home Rule (devolution) that modified the view of the unitary state of Great Britain; and his idea of a progressive, reforming party broadly based and capable of accommodating and conciliating varying interests, along with his speeches at mass public meetings.

Historian Walter L. Arnstein concludes &quot;Notable as the Gladstonian reforms had been, they had almost all remained within the nineteenth-century Liberal tradition of gradually removing the religious, economic, and political barriers that prevented men of varied creeds and classes from exercising their individual talents in order to improve themselves and their society. As the third quarter of the century drew to a close, the essential bastions of Victorianism still held firm: respectability; a government of aristocrats and gentlemen now influenced not only by middle-class merchants and manufacturers but also by industrious working people; a prosperity that seemed to rest largely on the tenets of laissez-faire economics; and a Britannia that ruled the waves and many a dominion beyond.

Lord Acton wrote in 1880 that he considered Gladstone one &quot;of the three greatest Liberals&quot; (along with Edmund Burke and Lord Macaulay).

In 1909 the Liberal Chancellor David Lloyd George introduced his &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;, the first budget which aimed to redistribute wealth. The Liberal statesman Lord Rosebery ridiculed it by asserting Gladstone would reject it, &quot;Because in his eyes, and in my eyes, too, as his humble disciple, Liberalism and Liberty were cognate terms; they were twin-sisters.&quot;

Lloyd George had written in 1913 that the Liberals were &quot;carving the last few columns out of the Gladstonian quarry&quot;.

Lloyd George said of Gladstone in 1915: &quot;What a man he was! Head and shoulders above anyone else I have ever seen in the House of Commons. I did not like him much. He hated Nonconformists and Welsh Nonconformists in particular, and he had no real sympathy with the working-classes. But he was far and away the best Parliamentary speaker I have ever heard. He was not so good in exposition.&quot;

Writing in 1944 the classical liberal economist Friedrich Hayek said of the change in political attitudes that had occurred since the Great War: &quot;Perhaps nothing shows this change more clearly than that, while there is no lack of sympathetic treatment of Bismarck in contemporary English literature, the name of Gladstone is rarely mentioned by the younger generation without a sneer over his Victorian morality and naive utopianism&quot;.

In the latter half of the 20th century Gladstone&#x27;s economic policies came to be admired by Thatcherite Conservatives. Margaret Thatcher proclaimed in 1983: &quot;We have a duty to make sure that every penny piece we raise in taxation is spent wisely and well. For it is our party which is dedicated to good housekeeping—indeed, I would not mind betting that if Mr Gladstone were alive today he would apply to join the Conservative Party&quot;. In 1996, she said: &quot;The kind of Conservatism which he and I...favoured would be best described as &#x27;liberal&#x27;, in the old-fashioned sense. And I mean the liberalism of Mr Gladstone, not of the latter-day collectivists&quot;. That sort of liberalism in the 21st century is termed neoliberalism.

A. J. P. Taylor wrote &quot;William Ewart Gladstone was the greatest political figure of the nineteenth century. I do not mean by that that he was necessarily the greatest statesman, certainly not the most successful. What I mean is that he dominated the scene.&quot;

==1900s: New Liberalism and welfare state ==
When the Liberals lost the 1895 general election, a political crisis shook the Liberal Party. Until that, the Liberal Party adhered to the Gladstonian liberalism, of free markets, low taxation, self-help and freedom of choice, but after the 1895 election many Liberals clamoured for political reform. The reformers&#x27; leaders were Thomas Hill Green and Herbert Samuel, that in the &quot;Progressive Review&quot; of December 1896, said that the classical liberalism was &quot;sapped and raddled&quot;, claiming for more state&#x27;s powers. Samuel&#x27;s &quot;New Liberalism&quot; called for old-age pensions, labour exchanges (job-placement organizations), and workers&#x27; compensation, all prefiguring modern welfare. Other important intellectuals 1906-14 included H. A. L. Fisher, Gilbert Murray, G. M. Trevelyan, Edwin Montagu, Charles Masterman, Alfred Marshall, Arthur Cecil Pigou and young John Maynard Keynes. Socialists meanwhile dominated the Fabian Society.

Key politicians included future prime ministers Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Winston Churchill, H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd George, sceptics of non-interventionism on economy and free market, embraced the New Liberalism. During the Liberal Governments of 1905–1916, the welfare state was introduced to provide provision for lower incomes. In 1908 a pension system was created with old-age pensions for people older than age 70; an income tax was introduced and in 1911 the National Insurance Act was approved. To fund extensive welfare reforms Lloyd George proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; (1909), which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected. The resulting constitutional crisis was only resolved after two elections in 1910 and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. His budget was enacted in 1910, and with the National Insurance Act 1911 and other measures helped to establish the modern welfare state. Lloyd George promoted the disestablishment of the Church in Wales, until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 suspended its implementation. All Liberals were outraged when Conservatives used their majority in the House of Lords to block reform legislation. In the House of Lords, the Liberals had lost most of their members, who in the 1890s &quot;became Conservative in all but name.&quot; The government could force the unwilling king to create new Liberal peers, and that threat did prove decisive in the battle for dominance of Commons over Lords in 1911.

However, the Great War of 1914 reduced popular support for the Liberals and the Party split in two factions in 1918: Asquith&#x27;s supporters and Lloyd George&#x27;s coupons. While Asquith became Leader of the Opposition, Lloyd George forged a coalition with the Conservative leader Bonar Law, continuing to be Prime Minister with a mostly Conservative base. The Liberal internal conflict caused many reformer and radical voters to join in the Labour Party, while more conservative liberals merged to the Conservatives led by Stanley Baldwin. The 1924 general election signalled the end of the Liberal Party as government force. However, the New Liberalism continued to be the preferred ideology by the Liberal Party, until its dissolution in 1988 when formed the Liberal Democrats.

==1940–1975: Post-war consensus==
The post-war consensus began in the 1930s when Liberal intellectuals led by John Maynard Keynes and William Beveridge developed a series of plans that became especially attractive as the wartime government promised a much better post-war Britain and saw the need to engage every sector of society. The foundations of the post-war consensus was the Beveridge Report. This was a report by William Beveridge, a Liberal economist who in 1942 formulated the concept of a more comprehensive welfare state in Great Britain. The report, in shortened terms, aimed to bring widespread reform to the United Kingdom and did so by identifying the &quot;five giants on the road of reconstruction&quot;: &quot;Want… Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness&quot;. In the report were labelled a number of recommendations: the appointment of a minister to control all the insurance schemes; a standard weekly payment by people in work as a contribution to the insurance fund; old age pensions, maternity grants, funeral grants, pensions for widows and for people injured at work; a new national health service to be established.

In the period between 1945 and 1970 (consensus years) that unemployment averaged less than 3%. The post-war consensus included a belief in Keynesian economics, a mixed economy with the nationalisation of major industries, the establishment of the National Health Service and the creation of the modern welfare state in Britain. The policies were instituted by all governments (both Labour and Conservative) in the post-war period. The consensus has been held to characterise British politics until the economic crises of the 1970s (see Secondary banking crisis of 1973–1975) which led to the end of the post-war economic boom and the rise of monetarist economics. The roots of his economics, however, stem from critique of the economics of the interwar period depression. Keynes&#x27; style of economics encouraged a more active role of the government in order to &quot;manage overall demand so that there was a balance between demand and output&quot;.

==1980s: Neoliberalism==

With the rise of Margaret Thatcher as Conservative Party leader in the 1975 leadership election ushered in a resurgence of the old 19th-century Gladstone &quot;laissez-faire&quot; Classical liberal principles. The UK in the 1970s had seen sustained high inflation rates, which were above 20% at the time of the leadership election, high unemployment, and over the winter of 1978–79 there was a series of strikes known as the &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;. Thatcher led her party to victory at the 1979 general election with a manifesto which concentrated on the party&#x27;s philosophy rather than presenting a &quot;shopping list&quot; of policies. This philosophy became known as Thatcherism and it focused on rejecting the post-war consensus that tolerated or encouraged nationalisation, strong labour unions, heavy regulation, high taxes, and a generous welfare state. Thatcherism was based on social and economic ideas from British and American intellectuals such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. Thatcher believed that too much socially democratic-oriented government policy was leading to a long-term decline in the British economy. As a result, her government pursued a programme of Classical liberalism, adopting a free-market approach to public services based on the sale of publicly owned industries and utilities, as well as a reduction in trade union power. She held the belief that the existing trend of unions was bringing economic progress to a standstill by enforcing &quot;wildcat&quot; strikes, keeping wages artificially high and forcing unprofitable industries to stay open.

Thatcherism promoted low inflation, the small state, and free markets through tight control of the money supply, privatisation and constraints on the labour movement. It is a key part of the worldwide Classical liberal movement and as such is often compared with Reaganomics in the United States, Economic Rationalism in Australia and Rogernomics in New Zealand. Thatcherism is also often compared to classical liberalism. Milton Friedman said that &quot;Margaret Thatcher is not in terms of belief a Tory. She is a nineteenth-century Liberal.&quot; Thatcher herself stated in 1983: &quot;I would not mind betting that if Mr Gladstone were alive today he would apply to join the Conservative Party&quot;. In the 1996 Keith Joseph memorial lecture Thatcher argued that &quot;The kind of Conservatism which he and I ... favoured would be best described as &#x27;liberal&#x27;, in the old-fashioned sense. And I mean the liberalism of Mr Gladstone, not of the latter day collectivists&quot;.

<doc id="846761" wikidata="Q66589603" url="?curid=846761" title="Xylose">
<text>Xylose ( , , &quot;wood&quot;) is a sugar first isolated from wood, and named for it. Xylose is classified as a monosaccharide of the aldopentose type, which means that it contains five carbon atoms and includes an aldehyde functional group. It is derived from hemicellulose, one of the main constituents of biomass. Like most sugars, it can adopt several structures depending on conditions. With its free aldehyde group, it is a reducing sugar.

==Structure==
The acyclic form of xylose has chemical formula . The cyclic hemiacetal isomers are more prevalent in solution and are of two types: the pyranoses, which feature six-membered rings, and the furanoses, which feature five-membered rings (with a pendant group). Each of these rings is subject to further isomerism, depending on the relative orientation of the anomeric hydroxy group.

The dextrorotary form, -xylose, is the one that usually occurs endogenously in living things. A levorotary form, -xylose, can be synthesized.

==Occurrence==
Xylose is the main building block for the hemicellulose xylan, which comprises about 30% of some plants (birch for example), far less in others (spruce and pine have about 9% xylan). Xylose is otherwise pervasive, being found in the embryos of most edible plants. It was first isolated from wood by Finnish scientist, Koch, in 1881, but first became commercially viable, with a price close to sucrose, in 1930.

Xylose is also the first saccharide added to the serine or threonine in the proteoglycan type O-glycosylation, and, so, it is the first saccharide in biosynthetic pathways of most anionic polysaccharides such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate.

Xylose is also found in some species of Chrysolinina beetles, including &quot;Chrysolina coerulans&quot;. They have cardiac glycosides (including xylose) in their defensive glands.

== Applications ==

=== Chemicals ===
The acid-catalysed degradation of hemicellulose gives furfural, a precursor to synthetic polymers and to tetrahydrofuran.

=== Human consumption ===

Xylose is metabolised by humans, although it is not a major human nutrient and is largely excreted by the kidneys. Humans can obtain xylose only from their diet. An oxidoreductase pathway is present in eukaryotic microorganisms. Humans have enzymes called protein xylosyltransferases (XYLT1, XYLT2) which transfer xylose from UDP to a serine in the core protein of proteoglycans.

Xylose contains 2.4 calories per gram (lower than glucose or sucrose, approx. 4 calories per gram).

=== Animal medicine ===

In animal medicine, xylose is used to test for malabsorption by administration in water to the patient after fasting. If xylose is detected in blood and/or urine within the next few hours, it has been absorbed by the intestines.

High xylose intake on the order of approximately 100 g/kg of animal body weight is relatively well tolerated in pigs, and in a similar manner to results from human studies, a portion of the xylose intake is passed out in urine undigested.

=== Derivatives ===
Reduction of xylose by catalytic hydrogenation produces the sugar substitute xylitol.

<text>This article aims to give a historical outline of liberalism in Germany (). The liberal parties dealt with in the timeline below are, largely, those which received sufficient support at one time or another to have been represented in parliament. Not all parties so included, however, necessarily labeled themselves &quot;liberal&quot;. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme.

==Background==
The early high points of liberalism in Germany were the Hambach Festival (1832) and the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

In the Frankfurt Parliament National Assembly in the Frankfurt am Main Frankfurt Paulskirche (1848/1849), the bourgeois liberal factions Casino and Württemberger Hof (the latter led by Heinrich von Gagern) were the majority. They favored a constitutional monarchy, popular sovereignty, and parliamentary rule.
Organized liberalism developed in the 1860s, combining the previous liberal and democratic currents. Between 1867 and 1933 liberalism was divided into progressive liberal and national liberal factions. Since 1945 only one liberal party has been significant in politics at the national level: The Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei, FDP).

<text>Liberalism in the Netherlands started as an anti-monarchical effort spearheaded by the Dutch statesman Thorbecke, who almost single-handedly wrote the 1848 Constitution of the Netherlands that turned the country into a constitutional monarchy.

In contemporary politics, there are both left and right-wing parties that refer to themselves as &quot;liberal&quot;, with the former more often espousing social liberalism and the latter more often espousing conservative liberalism. A common characteristic of these parties that they are nominally secular, in contrast to the traditionally dominant and still popular Christian democracy.

This article gives an overview of liberalism in the Netherlands. It is limited to political parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament.

==Background==
The Netherlands has a long liberal political tradition. From the founding of the Dutch Republic in the 16th century to beginning of the 19th century the main political conflict was between the liberal urban patriciate and the supporters of the House of Orange, from the lower class and orthodox variants of Protestantism. The urban patriciate favoured religious tolerance. Between mid-19th century to the late-1800 they were a dominant force in shaping the Dutch parliamentary democratic &quot;rechtsstaat&quot;. In the early 20th century the liberals split between progressive liberals and conservative liberals. Due to their political division and the introduction of universal suffrage the liberals disappeared from the political stage. After the Second World War the liberals were united again under one roof, the VVD, but the party remained small. It entered some administration coalitions as a junior party. A progressive liberal party, D&#x27;66 was founded in 1966. Since the 1970s however liberalism has been on the rise again electorally. Since 1977 the largest, more conservative, liberal party, VVD has been in government for twenty two years. In early 21st century the VVD saw major splits over the issue of integration and migration. In 2010, they won the national elections for the first time in its history.

=== Before 1918 ===
In the early years of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (1814–1848) the House of Representatives was dominated by conservatives supportive of the policy of government of William I and later William II. From 1840 onward, the amount of liberals in the House gradually increased. These liberals advocated a parliamentary democracy with a directly elected House of Representatives and in which the ministers, not the King, had executive power. In 1844, nine liberal representatives led by the jurist and historian Johan Rudolph Thorbecke attempted in vain to amend the constitution and introduce parliamentary democracy. In 1848, amidst a wave of revolutions across Europe, the balance of power shifted in favour of the liberals. In order to prevent civil unrest in the Netherlands, William II formed a commission, chaired by Thorbecke, which would draft a new constitution. The new constitution, which was introduced in October 1848, limited the power of the king by introducing ministerial responsibility and by giving parliament the right to amend laws and hold investigative hearings. It also extended the census suffrage and codified civil rights, such as the freedom of assembly, the privacy of correspondence, freedom of ecclesiastical organisation and the freedom of education.

In the period following the constitutional amendment, liberalism was the dominant political force in the Netherlands. Liberalism also dominated the universities, the media and business. The liberals supported a laissez-faire economy, free trade, civil rights and a gradual expansion of suffrage. Thorbecke became Prime Minister of the Netherlands in 1849, and would serve two more terms throughout his lifetime. Because of their dominant position, the liberals did not deem it necessary to organise themselves in a political party. Instead there was a loose liberal parliamentary group and locally organised liberal caucuses. The liberals also did not organize their own pillar, a system of like-minded social organisations. The liberals were politically allied with the Catholics, whom the liberals granted considerable freedom of religion. After Thorbecke&#x27;s death in 1872, the liberals grew increasingly disunited. By 1897, a division had emerged between the supporters of the progressive liberal Jan Kappeyne van de Coppello on the one side, and those of the conservative liberal Johan George Gleichman on the other.

Only in the late 19th century, when the opposition began to organise itself in the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the Roman Catholic State Party, the liberals followed suit. On 4 March 1885, the Liberal Union was established. In the 1890s some liberals, such as Samuel van Houten, Johannes Tak van Poortvliet and Kappeyne van de Coppello started to propose a more active role of the government, breaking with the Thorbeckian laissez-faire ideal. This led to the establishment of the progressive Free-thinking Democratic League in 1901. The liberals saw a second split with the establishment of the more conservative liberal League of Free Liberals in 1906. There are different names for these two tendencies. The more progressive liberals have been called &quot;radical&quot;, &quot;freeminded&quot; or &quot;democratic&quot; liberals, while the more conservative liberals have been called &quot;free&quot; or &quot;old&quot; liberals. The issue which divided the liberals most was the question whether to extend the census or even to introduce universal suffrage, the progressive liberals favoured universal suffrage, the conservative liberals did not. The progressive liberals also favoured government intervention in the economy, such as Van Houten&#x27;s ban on child labour.

Due to the two round electoral system the liberals were required to cooperate. In order to prevent the coalition of Catholics and Protestants win the second round of the elections, all the liberals united behind their candidates in the second round, often joined by social democrats. This alliance was called the concentration. On basis of concentration pluralities, often supported by social democrats for a majority several cabinets were formed in the early 20th century.

In 1917 under one of these liberal minority cabinets universal male suffrage was introduced, as well as a proportional electoral system and equal finance for religious schools, this compromise was called the pacification of 1917. The extension of suffrage however severely weakened the position of the liberals. Of the 37 seats they had in 1917, they were left with 14 in 1918.

=== 1918-1994 ===

In 1922 the liberal parties reorganized: all conservative liberals, from the Liberal Union and the League Free Liberals as well as more conservative liberals from smaller parties, joined to form the Liberal State Party. The progressive liberals remained separate in the Freeminded Democratic League, a merger of the Radical League and progressive liberals, that had already been formed in 1901. In the interbellum the liberals grew even smaller. Under pressure of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the rise of the National Socialist Movement. The liberals did cooperate as junior partners in several cabinets in the crisis.

After the Second World War the conservative liberal Liberal State Party refounded itself as Freedom Party. The progressive liberal Freeminded Democratic League joined the new &quot;Doorbraak&quot; leftwing Labour Party. Several progressives were unhappy with the social-democratic course of the PvdA and joined the Freedom Party to found the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy in 1948.

The VVD remained a small party until the 1970s, with about 10% of the vote. They did however form part of the government both in the grand coalition with social-democrats, Catholics and Protestants in the late 1940s early 1950s, and with the Catholics and Protestants over the course of the 1960s. The party was led by the former leader of the Freeminded Democratic League, Pieter Oud. In the Dutch pillarized political system the liberals mainly appealed to urban, secular upper and middle class. The liberals did not have a strong pillar of social organization, such as trade unions and news papers, like the other political families had. Instead they were aligned with the weak neutral pillar.

In 1966 a radical democratic party was founded, Democrats 66. In the foundation several progressive liberals from the VVD had been involved. The party sought to radically democratize the political system, the society and the economy. D66 was led by the charismatic Hans van Mierlo. The party joined forces with the social-democratic PvdA and the progressive Christian PPR to work for a more fair and democratic Netherlands. The party participated in the leftwing cabinet Den Uyl. Over the course of the 1980s however the party began to espouse a more progressive liberal course, especially under Jan Terlouw. The party remained an ally of the PvdA however, joining a short-lived centre-left coalition cabinet with the PvdA and the Christian democratic CDA in 1981.

In the meanwhile the VVD had grown considerably. Under the leadership of Hans Wiegel the VVD has taken a more conservative course. The party began to criticize the large and inefficient welfare state. The party combined this economic liberalism with progressive positions on social issues, which characterized the 1970s, such as abortion, homosexuality and women&#x27;s rights. The VVD capitalized the weakening of religious and depillarization of the 1970s and made considerable electoral gains: in 1967 the party won just over 10% in 1981 this had more than doubled to 23%.

Between 1982 and 1986 the VVD cooperated in the centre-right cabinets Lubbers, which implemented a far reaching reform of the welfare state the VVD had advocated since the 1970s.

=== After 1994 ===
In 1994 the Christian democratic CDA lost its traditional electoral power base. The VVD and D66 won considerably. A progressive purple cabinet was formed with D66 and the VVD under the lead of PvdA. The cabinet managed a thriving Dutch economy, implemented progressive social legislation on euthanasia, gay marriage and prostitution. In the 2002 election campaign the purple coalition came under heavy criticism of the populist politician Pim Fortuyn for mismanaging the public sector, migration and the integration of migrants. The two liberal parties lost considerably in the elections. Liberalism in the Netherlands came under attack after the shock assassination of Fortuyn just days before the election.

The VVD however joined a coalition cabinet with the heirs of Fortuyn and the CDA. The cabinet fell shortly. After the 2003 elections the D66 replaced the LPF. The centre-right cabinet implemented reforms of the welfare state and oversaw declining migration figures.

Migration and integration and especially the place of the Islam in the Netherlands, however, remained controversial issues. In 2003 the VVD had invited social-democratic critic of Islam, Ayaan Hirsi Ali to join their parliamentary party. She together with MP Geert Wilders caused considerable controversy with her direct criticism of the Islam. In the cabinet VVD minister Rita Verdonk sought to limit migration and stimulate integration of minorities. Two years after Fortuyn&#x27;s assassination, another murder, this time of filmmaker Theo van Gogh, put the country&#x27;s liberal tradition at further risk.

In 2004 Geert Wilders left the VVD to form the Party for Freedom, which combined uncompromising criticism of Islam with a plea for lower taxation and skepticism towards European integration. In 2006 a conflict between Hirsi Ali and Verdonk over her status as an asylum seeker caused the downfall of the cabinet after D66 had revoked its confidence of Verdonk, whose positions on migration the party had already distanced itself from.

In the 2006 general election the VVD and D66 lost considerably: D66 lost three of its six seats, the VVD six of its 28 seats. Wilders&#x27; PVV won nine seats. Rita Verdonk, second on the list of the VVD won more preference votes than the party&#x27;s lead candidate Mark Rutte. After demanding the leadership of the party, Verdonk left the VVD to form her own nationalist party, Proud of the Netherlands.

In the European Parliament election of 2009, the VVD and D66 both won 3 seats each, while PVV picked up 4 seats. The PVV was assigned the additional seat that went to the Netherlands after the Treaty of Lisbon was signed. The VVD and D66 joined the Liberal fraction in the European Parliament, while the PVV did not register as member of any fraction.

In the 2010 general election the VVD returned to previous strength and became the largest party the first time in history with 31 seats, leading to a liberal-led coalition for the first time since 1918. Also D66 increased their number of seats to 10. Ultimately, the VVD opted for a coalition with the CDA, with VVD leader Mark Rutte as prime minister—the first liberal to hold the post since 1918.

<text>Giovanni Berlinguer (; ; 9 July 1924 – 6 April 2015) was an Italian politician, humanist, and professor of social medicine.

==Life and career==
Giovanni Berlinguer was born in Sassari, Sardinia, the son of Mario Berlinguer. A physician and professor of public health, he worked first in social medicine at the University of Sassari (1969–1974) and then in occupational health at the Sapienza University of Rome (1975–1999). Like his brother Enrico, he was a major figure in the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1972, 1976, and 1979, and to the Senate of the Republic in 1983 and 1987. He ran for secretary of the Democrats of the Left (DS) in 2001 but was defeated by Piero Fassino 61.8% to 34.1%. From 2004 to 2009, Berlinguer was a member of the European Parliament representing the DS and sat with the Party of European Socialists group. At the convening of the European Parliament on 20 July 2004, he was found to be the oldest member, and as such presided over the parliament during the election of Josep Borrell Fontelles in 2004 and Hans-Gert Pöttering in 2007 as the president of the European Parliament.

Berlinguer was in charge of the first National Health Plan in the context of the Economic Development Program adopted by the Italian Parliament in 1968. He was also a member of the National Health Council between 1994 and 1996, and vice-chairman (1992–1995) and chairman (1999–2001) of the National Bioethics Committee (CNB). He was a member of the UNESCO International Bioethics Committee (2001–2007) and of the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, as well as of the World Health Organisation. He was rapporteur on the first project, held in 2003, of the UNESCO &quot;Universal Declaration on Bioethics&quot;.

In the years of his chairmanship, the CNB strategy underwent some noteworthy changes. Priority was no longer given to frontier bioethics but to its link with everyday bioethics, which Berlinguer articulated in his 2000 book &quot;Bioetica quotidiana&quot; (&quot;Everyday Bioethics&quot;). This change implied that the CNB opinions were open to contributions not only of specialists but also of lay people, and new channels of communication were established with the public at large. The democratic guidance had comments and a significant impact at the local, national, and international level.

Berlinguer died in Rome at the age of 90.

<doc id="846768" wikidata="Q4775012" url="?curid=846768" title="Antioch College">
<text>Antioch College is a private liberal arts college in Yellow Springs, Ohio. It was founded in 1850 by the Christian Connection and began operating in 1852 as a non-sectarian institution; politician and education reformer Horace Mann was its first president. The college is named after the ancient city of Antioch where the disciples of Jesus were first named as Christians.

The college has been politically liberal and reformist since its inception. It was the fourth college in the country to admit African-American students on an equal basis with whites. It has had a tumultuous financial and corporative history, closing repeatedly, for years at a time, until new funding was assembled.

Antioch College began opening new campuses in 1964, when it purchased the Putney School of Education in Vermont. Eventually it opened 38 different campuses, and in 1978 it changed its name to Antioch University. While most of the university&#x27;s campuses focused on adult education, graduate programs, and degree completion, Antioch College remained a traditional undergraduate institution on the original campus. In 2008, the university closed the college, but it reopened under new management in 2011 after a group of alumni formed the Antioch College Continuation Corporation and bought from the university both the physical campus and the right to use the name &quot;Antioch College.&quot;

Antioch has a cooperative education work program mandatory for all students. It is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association, the Global Liberal Arts Alliance, and the Strategic Ohio Council for Higher Education. The college is affiliated with two Nobel Prize winners, José Ramos-Horta and Mario Capecchi.

==History ==
Antioch College is on the site of a short-lived Owenite community, a utopian socialist collective agricultural enterprise that was established in July 1825 and terminated at the end of that year.

On October 5, 1850, the General Convention of the Christian Church passed a resolution stating &quot;that our responsibility to the community, and the advancement of our interests as a denomination, demand of us the establishing of a College.&quot; The delegates further pledged &quot;the sum of one hundred thousand dollars as the standard by which to measure our zeal and our effort in raising the means for establishing the contemplated College.&quot; The Committee on the Plan for a College was formed to undertake the founding of a college and make decisions regarding the name of the school, the endowment, fundraising, faculty, and administration. Most notably, the committee decided that the college &quot;shall afford equal privileges to students of both sexes.&quot; The Christian Connection sect wanted the new college to be sectarian, but the planning committee decided otherwise.

Despite its enthusiasm, the Christian Connection&#x27;s fundraising efforts were insufficient. The money raised before the school opened failed to cover the cost of the three original buildings, much less create an endowment. The Unitarian Church contributed an equal amount of funds and nearly as many students to the new school, causing denominational strife early on.

===1850–1899===
Horace Mann, Antioch&#x27;s first president, ran the college from its start in 1853 until his death in 1859. The young college had relatively high academic standards, and &quot;good moral character&quot; was a requirement for graduation. The first curriculum focused on Latin, Greek, mathematics, history, philosophy, and science, and offered electives in art, botany, pedagogy, and modern languages. Tuition was $24 a year, and the first graduating class consisted of 28 students. Although the founders planned for approximately 1,000 students, enrollment exceeded 500 only once in the 19th century, in 1857.

One notable character in Antioch&#x27;s history is Rebecca Pennell, Mann&#x27;s niece, who was one of the college&#x27;s ten original faculty members. She was the first female college professor in the United States to have the same rank and pay as her male colleagues. Her home, now part of the Antioch campus and called Pennell House, served in recent years as community space for several of Antioch&#x27;s student-led independent groups.

In 1859, Mann gave his final commencement speech, including what became the college&#x27;s motto: &quot;Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.&quot; Mann died in August and was interred on the Antioch College grounds. The next year, he was reinterred in Providence, Rhode Island, next to his first wife. Mann is commemorated by two monuments: an obelisk on campus that bears the college&#x27;s motto and marks his original grave, and a bronze statue in the Glen Helen.

Noteworthy among historical figures at the college are Austin Craig and Lucretia Crocker. The Reverend Craig became the third president of Antioch College. Crocker taught mathematics and astronomy. As the first woman supervisor of the Boston Public Schools, Crocker pioneered the discovery method of teaching mathematics and the natural sciences during her decade-long tenure, which began with her appointment in 1876. Earlier, in 1873, she was among the first women elected to the Boston School Committee, and a strong advocate for higher education for women.

====Racial and gender equity====
The original founders gave no consideration to the question of whether Antioch should admit students of color, neither forbidding nor explicitly allowing it. The associated preparatory school admitted two African-American girls during the mid-1850s, an action one trustee responded to by resigning and removing his own children from the school. His opinion was apparently the minority one, as the black students were not withdrawn.

====Financial difficulties====
Antioch College was insolvent the day it opened and faced financial difficulties from its first years. From 1857 to 1859, Antioch ran an annual deficit of $5,000 out of a total budget of $13,000. In 1858, Antioch was bankrupt. Mann died in 1859, and the college was reorganized, but deficits continued. Mann&#x27;s successor, Thomas Hill, took Antioch&#x27;s presidency on the condition that faculty salaries be paid despite deficits. Despite this stipulation, his salary was often not paid, and he supported his family with loans. Hill and a colleague attempted to raise an endowment, but potential donors were put off by the strong sectarian leanings of some of the college&#x27;s trustees. Hill resigned in 1862 due to increasing financial troubles, sectarian conflict between Christian Connection and Unitarian trustees, and his election as president of Harvard. In 1862, the college was closed until finances improved and remained closed until after the end of the Civil War.

====Unitarian phase====
In 1865, the college reopened, now administered by the American Unitarian Association. The financial health of the college seemed improved, as the Unitarians had raised a $100,000 endowment in two months. The endowment was originally invested in government bonds and later in real estate and timber. The investment income, while performing well, was still insufficient to maintain the college at the level desired by the trustees. Some of the principal was lost to foreclosures during the Long Depression, which began in 1873. The college closed again from 1881 to 1882 to allow the endowment to recover.

====Baseball milestone====

In 1869, when the Cincinnati Red Stockings began their inaugural season as the first professional baseball team, they played a preseason game at the site of what is now the Grand Union Terminal in Cincinnati against the Antiochs, who were regarded as one of the finest amateur clubs in Ohio. The game was played on May 15, 1869, and Cincinnati defeated Antioch 41–7. Antioch had been scheduled to host the first game of this professional tour on May 31, 1869, but it was rained out. So, while Antioch was not a part of the first professional baseball game, the college does hold claim to hosting the first ever rainout in professional baseball.

===1900–1945===
The turn of the century saw little improvement in the college&#x27;s finances. In 1900, faculty were paid between $500 and $700 a year, very low for the time, and the president was paid $1,500 a year. In contrast, Horace Mann&#x27;s annual salary had been $3,000 more than forty years prior. Enrollment did increase significantly under the presidency of Simeon D. Fess, who served from 1906 to 1917. In 1912 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served three of his five terms while also acting as president of Antioch.

World War I had little effect on the college, and though some people on campus contracted influenza during the Spanish flu epidemic, there were no deaths. In February 1919, YMCA attempted a peaceful takeover of the college, offering to raise an endowment of $500,000 if Antioch would serve as the official national college of YMCA of the USA. YMCA&#x27;s proposal was received positively by the college&#x27;s trustees and enacted by a unanimous vote, and Grant Perkins, a YMCA executive, assumed the college&#x27;s presidency. By May, Perkins had resigned, reporting that he was not prepared to raise the necessary funds.

====Morgan era====
In June 1919, several candidates were submitted to the trustees, including Arthur Morgan. Morgan was elected to the board without any prior notification of his candidacy. An engineer, he had been involved in planning a college in upstate New York that would have included work-study along with a more traditional curriculum. Morgan also received the right to demand the resignations of faculty and trustees. He presented his plan for &quot;practical industrial education&quot; to the trustees, who accepted the new plan. Antioch closed for a third time while the curriculum was reorganized and the co-op program developed. In 1920, Morgan was unanimously elected president and, in 1921, the college reopened with the cooperative education program.
The early co-op program was not required; students could enter as traditional students or cooperative education students. By the 1935 academic year, nearly 80% of the student body had chosen the cooperative program. Students initially studied for eight-week-long terms alternating with eight-week-long work experiences. Male students generally took apprenticeships with craftsmen or jobs in factories; female students often served as nursing or teaching assistants. In 1921, when the program was inaugurated, fewer than 1% of available co-op jobs were outside of Ohio, but that grew to about 75% within 15 years.

Morgan constructed a new board of trustees of prominent businessmen, replacing many of the local ministers and adding a new source of income. Charles Kettering alone contributed more than $500,000 to Antioch. Major donations by board members and their friends totaled more than $2 million for the decade. Kettering and other major patrons hoped to create a model institution that would create potential business administrators with students &quot;trained for proprietorship.&quot; The college declined an offer from John Henry Patterson to finance the college completely if Antioch would leave rural Yellow Springs, re-establish itself on NCR grounds in Dayton, and rechristen itself the National Cash Register College.

=== 1946–2000 ===

====Center of activism====
During World War II, Antioch, among other eastern colleges, with the help of Victor Goertzel, participated in a program that arranged for students of Japanese origin interned in Relocation camps to enroll in college. In 1943 the college Race Relations Committee began offering scholarships to non-white students to help diversify the campus, which had been mostly white since its founding. The first scholarship recipient was Edythe Scott, elder sister of Coretta Scott King. Coretta Scott also received the scholarship and attended Antioch two years after her sister. Antioch was also the first historically white college to appoint a black person to be chair of an academic department, when Walter Anderson was appointed chair of the music department.

In the 1950s, Antioch faced pressure from the powerful House Un-American Activities Committee and faced criticism from many area newspapers because it did not expel students and faculty accused of having Communist leanings.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the college continued to develop its reputation as a source of activism and progressive political thought. In 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave the commencement speech.

====Dixon presidency and development of university system====
Encouraged by President James Dixon, a Harvard-educated physician, upwards of 40 branch campuses and centers—known collectively as the Antioch Network (or The Network)—were established during the 1960s and 1970s, with the College as the central operating institution. Antioch University, of which Antioch College was now a component, formally came to exist in 1978. Antioch University New England was the first graduate school offshoot, in 1964, and many others were established as well, including what ultimately became Antioch University Midwest (located on a new campus in Yellow Springs that opened in September 2007).

Vice-president Morris Keeton in 1967 started the process of creating a campus in the new planned city of Columbia, Maryland. The land development promoted progressive clean-sheet concepts. The plans endured counter-culture cynicism with students calling the effort &quot;Rouseland&quot; and &quot;Rouse&#x27;s Fantasy Corporation&quot;. A field studies center opened with 150 students and interns working for the Rouse Company, but the project folded after a few years.

In many instances, the culture of the school spurred its students to activism. Eleanor Holmes Norton, future congressional delegate for Washington, D.C., recalled her time at Antioch as one &quot;when the first real action that could be called movement action was ignited.&quot;

The 1973 strike

In the 1960s, Antioch recruited poor and minority students through its New Directions scholarship program to improve educational opportunities for minorities. In the late 60s, as the administration added satellite centers across the country, the college adopted an academic program in Yellow Springs that gave students unprecedented independence in choosing their coursework. Then it doubled enrollment: Antioch had 2,470 students in 1972.

In 1973 the Nixon Administration threatened to cut federal aid. Financial-aid and New Directions students and activists demanded that Antioch guarantee their aid. On April 20, protesters barricaded the administration building and locked other buildings, shutting down the college for six weeks. Vandalism was extensive, including three arson fires requiring Fire Department response. The shutdown ended when county sheriffs came on campus to enforce a judge&#x27;s injunction against the strike. That year&#x27;s graduates received their diplomas by mail.

The strike and its notoriety resulted in many students transferring and a sharp decline in applications and enrollment, a decline that continued until the college closed in 2008 with 400 students.

====Birenbaum years====
After consideration of 337 candidates, William Birenbaum was chosen as president of Antioch College in April 1976. The chairman of the search committee called him a &quot;courageous and charismatic personality&quot; who is an &quot;experienced chief executive with a strong track record in crisis-type settings.&quot; By 1979, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described tensions on campus due to the school&#x27;s dire financial crisis and that Birenbaum&#x27;s &quot;pugnacious and often abrasive style had offended many Antiochians&quot;, with enrollment at the Yellow Springs, Ohio, campus dropping from 2,000 to 1,000 during the 1970s. Birenbaum implemented cost-cutting measures including a reduction in the number of satellite campus programs nationwide from 30 down to under 10 and changing the name of the corporation to Antioch University. By November 1980, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was able to report in a headline of an article about the college that &quot;A Streamlined Antioch Appears on the Way to Survival&quot;. Birenbaum announced in June 1984 that he would be retiring and Alan E. Guskin of the University of Wisconsin–Parkside was named to succeed him as of September 1, 1985.

====Late 20th century====
The college was led in the mid-1980s through the 1990s by Antioch presidents Alan Guskin, James Crowfoot, and Bob Devine. Citing the challenges of serving as both the college and University president, Guskin presided over the change to what he described as a federal model, wherein Antioch College became one of the campuses comprising Antioch University, which newly had its own central administration. Guskin served as the university&#x27;s first chancellor, while James E. Crowfoot became the first president of solely Antioch College since Birenbaum. Antioch College&#x27;s enrollment figures never surpassed 1,000 students but the campus underwent renovations and buildings that had been boarded up were repaired and reopened, including South Hall, one of the college&#x27;s three original buildings.

====Sexual Offense Prevention Policy (SOPP)====
A &quot;Sexual Offense Prevention Policy&quot; was initiated after two date rapes reportedly occurred on the Antioch College campus during the 1990–91 academic year.

In 1991 a group of students formed under the name &quot;Womyn of Antioch&quot; to address their concern that sexual offenses in general were not being taken seriously enough by the administration or some in the campus community. A &quot;Sexual Offense Prevention Policy,&quot; was created during a couple of late-night meetings in the campus Womyn&#x27;s Center, as the Antioch College website commented &quot;this original policy was questionable. It was not legally binding, no rights were given to the accused, and it called for immediate expulsion of the accused with no formal process.&quot; The policy was presented when the Womyn of Antioch stormed a community meeting a few days later.

In 1991–92 the college employed a part-time advocate, as the start of the Sexual Offenses Prevention and Survivors&#x27; Advocacy Program (SOP/SAP), who developed with the aid of the community the Antioch Sexual Offense Prevention Policy. Thus Antioch College became the first in America to mandate ongoing verbal affirmation during sexual encounters. Under this policy, consent for sexual behavior must be &quot;(a) verbal, (b) mutual, and (c) reiterated for every new level of sexual behavior.&quot;

This policy was the subject of media satire, such as a parody sketch in 1993 on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; titled &quot;Is It Date Rape?&quot; Some media outlets voiced support for the policy. For example, syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman asserted that most &quot;sexual policy makers write like lawyers in love,&quot; and that, likewise, &quot;at Antioch the authors could use some poetry, and passion.&quot; But she was ultimately sympathetic to their goals of leveling the sexual playing field and making students think about what consent means, saying that the Antioch campus &quot;has the plot line just about right.&quot;

By 2015, similar affirmative consent standards were adopted by colleges across the nation, including every Ivy League university except Harvard, as well as by state legislatures including California, Michigan, and New York.

In late 2022, some students were demanding changes to the SOPP following a sexual encounter between a professor and a student which the student characterized as &quot;sexual assault and ... sexual harassment.&quot;

===The 21st century===
In 2000, Antioch College was again subject to media attention after inviting political activist and former death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal and transgender rights advocate and Abu-Jamal supporter Leslie Feinberg to be commencement speakers. Graduating students had chosen Abu-Jamal and Feinberg to highlight their concerns with capital punishment and the American criminal justice system. Many conservative commentators criticized the Antioch administration for allowing students to choose such controversial commencement speakers and the college administration received death threats. Antioch President Bob Devine chose not to overturn the students&#x27; choice of speakers, citing the ideals of free speech and free exchange of ideas, and likened the media reaction to the coverage of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1965 commencement address.

====Change in structure====
The college uncovered accounting mistakes starting in 2006, which doubled the school&#x27;s projected deficit. At an Antioch University Board of Trustees meeting in June 2007 the board stated that while the college was in only its third year of implementation of a rescue plan, they had not raised the funds needed, and the college would be indefinitely closed at the end of the 2007–08 academic year.

====Alumni action to save the college====
Many Antioch alumni and faculty, upset at the prospect of the loss of the college&#x27;s legacy, began organizing and raising funds in an effort to save the college, keep it open without interruption, and gain greater transparency in its governance. In August 2007, the college faculty filed suit against the Board of Trustees, charging that the board was violating various contractual obligations.

Following a meeting between university and alumni representatives in August 2007, the Board of Trustees approved a resolution giving the Alumni Board until the October 2007 trustees&#x27; meeting to demonstrate the viability of an Alumni Board proposal to maintain the operations of the college. Despite initially stating he would remain until December, Antioch president Steve Lawry abruptly stepped down as president on September 1, 2007. The role of president was turned over to a three-person group, comprising the Dean of Faculty, Director of Student Services, and Director of Communications. While no reason for Lawry&#x27;s immediate departure was given, it has been reported that he was forcibly ousted by the board of trustees. In response to this reported ousting, the faculty gave Antioch University Chancellor Toni Murdock a vote of no confidence.

A story about Antioch&#x27;s closing in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; detailed the uncertain future of some faculty and staff members, along with the town of Yellow Springs, following suspended operations at the college. One professor, who received tenure just 28 hours before the college announced its closing, had turned down other jobs in academia to work at Antioch. The story includes a slideshow showing outdated and crumbling buildings on campus.

On November 3, 2007, the University Board of Trustees agreed to lift the suspension of the college provided that the alumni association would provided the necessary operating revenue. Specific benchmarks for fundraising were agreed upon. The Alumni Board embarked on a $100 million fundraising drive to build the college&#x27;s endowment, raising more than $18 million in gifts and pledges by November 2007. However, major donors balked out of concern that the deal did not make the college sufficiently autonomous from the university, and a group began meeting directly with the university, incorporating as the Antioch College Continuation Corporation (ACCC). On February 22, 2008, the university issued a press release reinstating the suspension, despite ongoing negotiations with the group. On March 28, 2008, ACCC negotiators rejected a $12.2 million demand from the university for the sale of those university assets associated with the operation of the college. ACCC instead offered $10 million for 10 seats on the 19-member board effectively seeking control of the entire university. On May 8, 2008, university trustees rejected the ACCC&#x27;s &quot;best and final&quot; offer – $9.5 million for the college and another $6 million for the graduate campuses in exchange for eight board seats, with an additional four new trustees to be jointly agreed upon by the ACCC and current trustees.

====Temporary closure after separation from university====
The college, then with about 400 students, closed on June 30, 2008. The suspension of operations of the college led to a collaboration between the university and certain college alumni to explore a means to separate the college from the university in a manner that preserved the viability of both. Recognizing that any reopening of the college required the cooperation and substantial financial support of alumni, the Board of Governors of Antioch University adopted a resolution on June 8, 2008, requesting that the Alumni Association prepare a plan to bring the college back to vigor and vitality. Thereafter, the Antioch University Board of Governors announced on July 17, 2008, the creation of a new task force composed of University and Alumni representatives to develop a plan to create an independent Antioch College. The task force discussions were facilitated in part by the Great Lakes College Association. During this time, a group of alumni with former faculty, staff, and students of the college formed what would become the Nonstop Liberal Arts Institute in 2008, an effort to preserve the DNA of the college during its closure and to create a bridge between the original college and a potentially new independent college. As the result of the task force discussions, ACCC and Antioch University agreed to an asset purchase agreement on June 30, 2009, at a sale price of $6,080,000. That agreement called for the transfer of the college campus, Glen Helen Nature Preserve and the college endowment to ACCC which would operate the college as an independent corporation with its own fiduciary board of trustees; but, it provided for Antioch University to retain reverter rights to campus real estate, Glen Helen, and the College&#x27;s continuation fund. As part of the transaction, Antioch University licensed to ACCC an exclusive right to use the name &quot;Antioch College&quot;. The parties closed on the transfer of assets on September 4, 2009. Matthew A. Derr was hired as interim president to recruit an entering class for the Fall of 2011.

====Revival and reopening====
In October 2010, Mark Roosevelt, formerly of Pittsburgh Public Schools and former legislator in Massachusetts who authored an education reform law in 1993, was hired as the new president. The following year, Antioch reopened as an independent four-year college in the autumn of 2011 with 35 students after the Ohio Board of Regents approved the college again offering Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.

Antioch University agreed on the official transfer of ownership of WYSO and the Kettering Building to Antioch College for $8 million on July 3, 2013, along with the release of Antioch University&#x27;s reverter rights retained in the prior sale.

Also in 2012, Antioch announced it would offer free tuition to its students for the following three years, pledging to charge them only room, board, and fees. As a result, Antioch College received more than 2,500 applications for fall 2012 admission. About five percent of applicants received acceptance letters. After tuition was re-introduced, applications and selectivity fell with 140 applicants for 2016 entrance and a 71% acceptance rate.

The Higher Learning Commission granted the newly restored Antioch College candidacy status in pursuit of accreditation on June 13, 2014. The commission also allowed the college &quot;to take the fast track to accreditation ... on a two-year path rather than the traditional four-year process.&quot; The college&#x27;s students would thereby be eligible for federal financial aid. Two years later, the commission granted Antioch College accreditation. Antioch&#x27;s accreditation was continued in 2021 but subject to provision of certain reports in 2022 and 2023.

Between 2011 and 2015, the college borrowed against a $42 million endowment to finance $37 million in capital improvements. On May 5, 2015, Roosevelt announced that he would depart as president of Antioch College at the end of the year. Dr. Thomas Manley was hired as the new president, and began his presidency in March 2016. 

With accreditation secure in 2016, President Manley initiated a process of refinement and visioning for the future of the College known as FACT (the Framework for Antioch College&#x27;s Transition). The FACT process engaged the entire College community in multiple design-build workshops to co-design a new educational model that integrates assets like Co-op, NPR radio station WYSO, the Wellness Center, Antioch Kitchens, the Antioch Farm, Glen Helen Nature Preserve, the Coretta Scott King Center, Antioch College Village and others, as major building blocks for learning and revenue generation. The FACT process has led to the creation of an updated vision, Antioch @175: A New Kind of American College.

In the fall of 2017, only 28 new students enrolled, with 19 freshmen and 9 transfer students. This was far fewer than the administration&#x27;s target of 60 and left overall enrollment at 135. The following spring, the college announced that faculty and staff making more than $40,000 annually would be required to take 10 days of furlough, the equivalent of a 3.8% pay cut. This follows previous staff cuts and salary reductions in the face of continued budget shortfalls.

In early 2019, the college divested itself of WYSO for about $3.5 million. For the fall class of 2019, new enrollments declined to 27 students, with the total student body being under 100 students. The COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020 led to furloughs for as many as 27 staff members, hour reductions for others, and pay cuts for faculty and other higher-earning personnel. Eight furloughed staff employees were laid off; and, faculty was reduced by six, through voluntary and negotiated departures and one retirement. Antioch also arranged the sale of the Glen Helen Nature Preserve to the Glen Helen Association, since the college could not afford to continue support of that facility. In October 2020, Antioch paused publication of The Antioch Review for financial and staffing reasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 23, 2020, the college announced a spending cut of $2.5 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1, down about 20% from the prior fiscal year&#x27;s budget.

In December 2020, after the resignation of President Manley due to health reasons, interim leadership until a new president was chosen was shared by three members of the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees: Sharen Neuhardt (operations), John K. Jacobs (finance), and Shadia Alvarez (equity and strategic development).

By fall 2020, enrollment improved despite the pandemic with 50 new first year students and an increase of 22% overall. 

The presidential search committee, led by Ro Nita Hawes-Saunders of the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, announced in August 2021 the selection of Dr. Jane Fernandes as the new president. Previously president of Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina, Dr. Fernandes is the second female president in the college&#x27;s history, as well as its first deaf president. As part of her turnaround plan, President Fernandes announced in February 2023 the elimination of nine staff and faculty positions, along with plans to restructure eight more positions with title changes and salary reductions. In August 2023 the College announced current or future sale or lease of several buildings as part of its rescaling plan, including the Children&#x27;s Center at East Limestone and Corry, the Sontag-Fels building, West Hall, and the Kettering Building. The Antioch Student Union building was sold in mid-2024, with the new owner intending to demolish it and build apartments. Despite the fundraising and cost-cutting, it was announced in early February, 2025 that the Higher Learning Commission had assigned a &quot;financial distress designation&quot; to Antioch, after a 2023 audit raised &quot;substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.&quot;

==== Graduations ====
After the 2008 closure, graduations did not resume until 2015, when 21 students graduated. Recent graduating classes have been of similar size,12 students in 2021, 18 in 2023, and 17 in 2024. During COVID, the ceremonies for the Class of 2020 and 2021 were held virtually.

===Admissions===
Antioch practices need-blind admission for domestic students. Prospective students are not required to submit SAT or ACT scores for admission. For 2022, Antioch had a 72% acceptance rate and, for those submitting scores, the 25–75% ranges were SAT 1195–1285 and ACT 19–26.

==Academics==
Antioch College offers a universal self-design major leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree and two majors leading to the Bachelor of Science. Students may pursue one of five interderdisciplinary pathways to the self-designed major: Culture, Power, &amp; Change; Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Creative Practice; Global Studies &amp; Engagement; Social Enterprise &amp; Innovation; or Sustainability &amp; the Environment. Students may also develop a self-designed major in either the arts or sciences. Courses are offered on a quarter-based academic calendar. All students are required to take at least two courses in each of the Antioch-designated Liberal Arts traditions: the Arts, Humanities, Sciences, and Social Sciences, as well as four interdisciplinary &quot;Global Seminar&quot; courses from the topics of Water, Food, Energy, Health, Governance, and Education. Additionally, students must achieve &quot;novice-high proficiency&quot; in a second language. Antioch College currently offers coursework in French, Spanish, and Japanese. Students may test out of taking the language requirement by taking the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI), or have passed an AP exam with a score of 4 or 5. Students must also complete a co-op program in each year.

Antioch has a 7 to 1 student to faculty ratio and 100% of its classes have fewer than 20 students.

===Co-op program===
All Antioch students spend four quarters over four years in work experiences in the college&#x27;s co-op program as part of their academic requirements for graduation.

===Accreditation===
Antioch College held continuous accreditation from 1927 through the late 1970s as the undergraduate college of Antioch University. Accreditation remained with Antioch University when it closed the college in 2008. Following Antioch College&#x27;s reopening and separation from the university, it underwent a multi-year, multi-phase process seeking to gain accreditation as an independent institution. While the college sought accreditation, Antioch College was authorized by the Ohio Board of Regents to offer Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. On June 30, 2016, the Higher Learning Commission (&quot;HLC&quot;) granted Antioch College accreditation, with the school&#x27;s next Comprehensive Evaluation scheduled for October 5, 2020. That 2020 evaluation resulted in the letter of March 12, 2021, in which the HLC notified Antioch that it was continuing the accreditation of the college, but subject to the provision of interim reports in 2022 and 2023 on various topics, including a plan to eventually recruit sufficient numbers of faculty to drive and manage effectual faculty evaluation and faculty development processes, and establishment of measurement metrics for Antioch&#x27;s strategic plans, goals and objectives by using measurable Key Performance Indicators. The next regularly-scheduled Reaffirmation of Accreditation will be in the 2025–26 timeframe.

===Full-tuition fellowships===
Every student admitted between fall 2011 through fall 2014 (the graduating classes of 2015–2018) received the Horace Mann Fellowship, which covered the full cost of tuition for four years.

===Rankings and recognition===
The &quot;Huffington Post&quot; in 2010 recognized Antioch College on its list of &quot;Top Non-Traditional Colleges&quot; alongside Brown University, the New School, and Wesleyan University, among others.

Antioch has been regularly included in the guidebook &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot; which declared in the 2006 edition that &quot;there is no college or university in the country that makes a more profound difference in a young person&#x27;s life or that creates more effective adults.&quot;

During her remarks to the college in 2004, alumna Coretta Scott King stated that &quot;Antioch students learn that it&#x27;s not enough to have a great career, material wealth and a fulfilling family life. We are also called to serve, to share, to give and to do what we can to lift up the lives of others. No other college emphasizes this challenge so strongly. That&#x27;s what makes Antioch so special.&quot;

In Fall 2023, Antioch was ranked #100 Top National Liberal Arts College &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;-- the highest rank since 1991 and after being unranked since reopening-- but fell to #165 in the 2025 edition.

==Campus and other non-curricular assets==
Antioch&#x27;s campus is in the town of Yellow Springs, Ohio, approximately 20 miles from Dayton, Ohio, and 65 miles from Cincinnati, Ohio. Antioch Hall, North and South Halls are the three original buildings on the campus, and are on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Greene County, Ohio. The historic 1929 Science Building donated by Charles Kettering began a $3.5 million partial renovation in 2012, transforming into the campus Arts and Science Building and obtaining a LEED Silver-level environmental certification in 2018.

===Housing===
The 1948 Birch Hall dormitory, designed in the modern Cubist style of post WWII architecture by famed architect Eero Saarinen, housed the first class of post-closure students in 2011–2012. Birch Hall is now used as an upperclassmen dormitory. The North Hall dormitory was renovated shortly thereafter and is used primarily as an underclassmen dormitory. Dormitories are co-ed, though students may request a suite with same-sex/gender roommates.

===Sustainability===

An 1852 dormitory, North Hall, has been extensively renovated, making it the oldest building in the United States to meet the LEED Gold Standard for sustainable construction. North Hall&#x27;s energy self-sufficiency includes solar panels on its roof, and geothermal energy for heating and cooling. About 25 geothermal wells were sunk 600 feet deep on the lawn near North Hall to supply water pumped through the building to maintain livable temperatures.

Antioch College also has a college farm. The farm contains a large crop growing area, a hoop house, and pasture for sheep and chickens. The farm is used as a living laboratory where Antioch students learn about sustainable farming methods such as organic farming and permaculture, and despite run-ins with animal rights activists provides meat and other ingredients for the campus dining program.

In 2014, Antioch installed a five-acre solar array adjacent to its farm in the South Campus. Approximately 3,300 solar panels generate 1.2 million kilowatt hours of energy annually.

In 2018, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) awarded Antioch College Silver status in its Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS). AASHE also named Antioch College as a top performing institution in its &quot;Sustainable Campus Index&quot; in the categories of Grounds (five-way tie for second place nationally) and Food &amp; Dining (seventh place nationally). The college is listed 188th among the Sierra Club&#x27;s Cool Schools for 2018, and 244th for 2021.

===Glen Helen Nature Preserve===
The Glen Helen Nature Preserve, donated to Antioch College by alumnus Hugh Taylor Birch in 1929, is a thousand-acre nature preserve owned and managed for many years by the college. The Glen encompasses 25 miles of footpaths, forests, waterfalls, and the springs for which the town of Yellow Springs, Ohio, is named. The grounds are open to the public. The Glen has an Outdoor Education Center founded in 1956 which hosts a variety of programs throughout the year, including programs on geology, wildlife ecology, and environmental education. There is also an accompanying Raptor Center whose purpose is the care and rehabilitation of injured birds of prey. The Raptor Center has a variety of hawks, owls, falcons, and a resident eagle on display.

Glen Helen was closed to the public on March 25, 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak. The Antioch College Board of Trustees stated in May 2020 that the college had no plans to reopen the preserve, since it could no longer afford to support the operation. Antioch held talks with the Glen&#x27;s longtime nonprofit friends group, the Glen Helen Association (“GHA”), and on June 10 an agreement in principle was announced transferring the Glen to GHA for about $2.5 million, payable over 10 years. The transfer of ownership was complete by September 4, 2020. The parties agreed to work together to keep the Glen available to students and faculty as well as the general public.

===WYSO===

WYSO is a National Public Radio station formerly owned by Antioch College and originally located on campus. The station began broadcasting in February 1958 for four hours a day as a student-run station. It was owned by the college from February 1958 until August 2019, when the station became a community owned non-profit after an amicable separation.

When WYSO became independently owned and operated from Antioch College in 2019, the college received $3.5 million as compensation. The station continues in collaboration with the college, such as by working with college students as interns. However, in July 2021, the station announced it was relocating out of the Kettering Building on the Antioch campus and into the Union School House owned by Iron Table Holdings, a company held by Yellow Springs resident and comedian Dave Chappelle. As of early 2025, the Schoolhouse building was still undergoing renovations, but WYSO had raised the necessary $2.5M for its part of the project.

===Olive Kettering Library===
The Olive Kettering Library is Antioch College&#x27;s library, named after the wife of Antioch trustee, inventor, and engineer Charles Franklin Kettering. Founded in 1954, the Olive Kettering Library houses more than 325,000 volumes, 900 periodicals, and 4,000 phonograph records. The 44,000 square foot library is also home to Antiochiana, Antioch College&#x27;s archive, located on 200 shelves of the second floor. As of 2023, the library had three full-time employees and a small number of part-time student workers.

== Former projects ==
===&quot;The Antioch Review&quot;===
&quot;The Antioch Review&quot;, founded in 1941, was one of the oldest continuously published literary magazines in the United States prior to it being put on hiatus by the college in 2020. It included fiction, essays, and poetry from both emerging as well as established authors. Throughout the history of the magazine questions about race, ethnicity, sex, education, and the American experience had a large place. Academic questions in their formal sense have not loomed large, and the magazine&#x27;s policy of refusing to run footnotes is, in fact, a statement about the non- (rather than anti-) academic nature of the journal. Many academics contributed, including Malcolm Bradbury and Eric Bentley, within a belles-lettres or journalistic tradition. &quot;The Antioch Review&quot; avoided narrow academic debates and tried to suggest that although professors may be for the academy, their commentaries can bear on larger social and intellectual processes. &quot;The Review&quot; always tried to be a forum for new writers and ideas in poetry and the short story.

Antioch stated in October 2020 that because of the college&#x27;s financial challenges, the Review was being put on hiatus after the Winter 2020 issue (which saw delayed publication until the Summer of 2020) while the college explored its options. It had not restarted by early 2025.

===Antioch College Village===
Antioch College Village was conceived in 2013 as a way for Antioch to utilize surplus college land to develop an ongoing revenue stream, while providing a model cohousing community to Yellow Springs. The full project was originally envisioned to involve 300 housing units; but, after years of public charettes and studies, construction was to have started with a simple 8-cottage pocket neighborhood development in mid-2019. However, on August 29, 2019, the Planning and Zoning Department of the Village of Yellow Springs was asked by Antioch to extend its PUD zoning permission for the project for one more year, as construction was expected during such period. As of 2025, the project had not started; the website of project designer McLennan Design still lists it as “In planning,” while the Antioch website&#x27;s only mention of Antioch College Village is that the school is “considering developing” the project.

<doc id="846771" wikidata="Q238290" url="?curid=846771" title="Mitsuko Uchida">
<text>is a Japanese-English classical pianist and conductor. Born in Japan and naturalised in England, she is particularly notable for her interpretations of Mozart and Schubert.

She has appeared with many notable orchestras, recorded a wide repertory with several labels, won numerous awards and honours (including Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2009) and is the co-artistic director, with Jonathan Biss, of the Marlboro Music School and Festival. She has also conducted several major orchestras.

==Life and career==
Born in Atami, a seaside town close to Tokyo, Japan, Uchida moved to Vienna, Austria, with her diplomat parents when she was 12 years old, after her father was named the Japanese ambassador to Austria. She is the youngest of three children. She enrolled at the Vienna Academy of Music to study with Richard Hauser and later Wilhelm Kempff and Stefan Askenase. She gave her first Viennese recital at the age of 14 at the Vienna Musikverein. Uchida also studied with Maria Curcio, the last and favourite pupil of Artur Schnabel. She remained in Vienna to study when her father was transferred back to Japan after five years.

She was awarded tenth prize at the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in 1968, playing Beethoven, Debussy, and Gaston Brenta in the finals. In 1969 Uchida won the first prize in the and in 1970 the second prize in the VIII International Chopin Piano Competition. In 1975, she won second prize in the Leeds Piano Competition.

In 1998 Uchida was the music director of the Ojai Music Festival in conjunction with conductor and violinist, David Zinman.

She is an acclaimed interpreter of the works of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Debussy and Schoenberg. She has recorded all of Mozart&#x27;s piano sonatas (a project that won the Gramophone Award in 1989) and concerti, the latter with the English Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Jeffrey Tate. Her recording of the Schoenberg Piano Concerto with Pierre Boulez won another Gramophone Award. Uchida is further noted for her recordings of Beethoven&#x27;s complete piano concerti with Kurt Sanderling conducting, Beethoven&#x27;s late piano sonatas, and a Schubert piano cycle. She is also respected as a distinguished interpreter of the works of the Second Viennese School.

Her 2009 recording of the Mozart piano concertos nos. 23 and 24, in which she conducted the Cleveland Orchestra as well as playing the solo part, won the Grammy Award in 2011. This recording was the start of a project to record all the Mozart piano concertos for a second time, conducting the Cleveland Orchestra from the piano. Further recordings for this project were released in 2011, 2012 and 2014.

From 2002 to 2007 she was artist-in-residence for the Cleveland Orchestra, where she led performances of all Mozart&#x27;s solo piano concertos. She has also conducted the English Chamber Orchestra, from the keyboard. In 2010, she was artist-in-residence for the Berlin Philharmonic. She was senior artist at the Marlboro Music School and Festival in 1974 and 1992, and has been permanently associated with Marlboro since 1994 when she became a member of the Committee for Artistic Direction. In 1999 she became one of two artistic directors along with fellow pianist Richard Goode. She served as the sole director until 2018 when Marlboro Music announced that American pianist Jonathan Biss would assume the role of co-artistic director. She is also a founding trustee of the Borletti-Buitoni Trust, an organisation established to help young artists develop and sustain international careers. In May 2012, the Royal Philharmonic Society announced that she would be honoured with their Gold Medal (she received the society&#x27;s annual Music Award in 2003); previous recipients have included Johannes Brahms (1877), Frederick Delius and Sir Edward Elgar (1925), Richard Strauss (1936), Igor Stravinsky (1954), Benjamin Britten and Leonard Bernstein (1987).

Her 2015 performance with the Cleveland Orchestra elicited this review from the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;:
Her 2022 recording of Beethoven&#x27;s Diabelli Variations was nominated for a Grammy for Best Classical Instrumental Solo and won a Gramophone Piano Award.

On July 2, 2024, The Times published a letter to the editor, co-signed by Uchida and numerous other Catholic and non-Catholic public figures, calling upon the Holy See to preserve what they describe as the &quot;magnificent&quot; cultural artifact of the Catholic Church&#x27;s Traditional Latin Mass.

<text>A get-rich-quick scheme is a plan to obtain high rates of return for a small investment. Most schemes create an impression that participants can obtain this high rate of return with little risk, skill, effort, or time. 

The term &quot;get rich quick&quot; has been used to describe shady investments since at least the early 20th century.

Get-rich-quick schemes often assert that wealth can be obtained by working at home. Get-rich-quick schemes that operate entirely on the Internet usually promote &quot;secret formulas&quot; to affiliate marketing and affiliate advertising. The scheme will usually claim that it does not require any special IT or marketing skills and will provide an unrealistic timeframe in which the individual could make hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. Since the growth in popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the early 2020s, skeptics have accused many NFT projects of resembling get-rich-quick schemes.

Legal and quasi-legal get-rich-quick schemes are frequently advertised on infomercials and in magazines and newspapers. Illegal schemes or scams are often advertised through spam or cold calling. Some forms of advertising for these schemes market books or compact discs about getting rich quick rather than asking participants to invest directly in a concrete scheme.

<doc id="846773" wikidata="Q842176" url="?curid=846773" title="Good Vibrations">
<text>&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; is a song by the American rock band the Beach Boys that was composed by Brian Wilson with lyrics by Mike Love. It was released as a single on October 10, 1966, and was an immediate critical and commercial hit, topping record charts in several countries including the United States and the United Kingdom. Characterized by its complex soundscapes, episodic structure and subversions of pop music formula, it was at the time the most expensive single ever recorded. &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; later became widely acclaimed as one of the finest and most important works of the rock era.

Also produced by Wilson, the title derived from his fascination with cosmic vibrations, as his mother would tell him as a child that dogs sometimes bark at people in response to their &quot;bad vibrations&quot;. He used the concept to suggest extrasensory perception, while Love&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by the nascent Flower Power movement. The song was written as it was recorded and in a similar fashion to other compositions from Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Smile&quot; period. It was issued as a standalone single, backed with &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Away for Awhile&quot;, and was to be included on the never-finished album &quot;Smile&quot;. Instead, the track appeared on the September 1967 release &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;.

The making of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was unprecedented for any kind of recording. Building on his approach for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Wilson recorded a surplus of short, interchangeable musical fragments with his bandmates and a host of session musicians at four different Hollywood studios from February to September 1966, a process reflected in the song&#x27;s several dramatic shifts in key, texture, instrumentation and mood. Over 90 hours of tape was consumed in the sessions, with the total cost of production estimated to be in the tens of thousands of dollars. Band publicist Derek Taylor dubbed the unusual work a &quot;pocket symphony&quot;. It helped develop the use of the studio as an instrument and heralded a wave of pop experimentation and the onset of psychedelic and progressive rock. The track featured a novel mix of instruments, including jaw harp and Electro-Theremin, and although the latter is not a true theremin, the song&#x27;s success led to a renewed interest and sales of theremins and synthesizers.

&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Vocal Group performance in 1967 and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1994. The song was voted number one in &quot;Mojo&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Records of All Time&quot; and number 6 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2004 and 2010 editions of its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; lists, re-ranked to number 53 in the 2021 iteration. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. In later years, the song has been cited as a forerunner to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; (1967) and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (1975). A 1976 cover version by Todd Rundgren peaked at number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The Beach Boys followed up &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; with another single pieced from sections, &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; (1967), but it was less successful.

==Inspiration and writing==
===Concept and early lyrics===
The Beach Boys&#x27; leader, Brian Wilson, was responsible for the musical composition and virtually all of the arrangement for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Most of the song&#x27;s structure and arrangement was written as it was recorded. During the recording sessions for the 1966 album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Wilson began changing his writing process. For &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, Wilson said, &quot;I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called &#x27;feels.&#x27; Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I&#x27;d felt, and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic.&quot; Engineer Chuck Britz is quoted saying that Wilson considered the song to be &quot;his whole life performance in one track&quot;. Wilson stated: &quot;I was an energetic 23-year-old. ... I said: &#x27;This is going to be better than [the Phil Spector production] &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;.

Wilson said that &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was inspired by his mother: &quot;[She] used to tell me about vibrations. I didn&#x27;t really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word &#x27;vibrations.&#x27; She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can&#x27;t see, but you can feel.&quot; Brian first enlisted &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian&#x27;s primitive piano playing style. Asher remembered: 

Wilson wanted to call the song &quot;Good Vibes&quot;, but Asher advised that it was &quot;lightweight use of the language&quot;, and suggested that &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; would sound less &quot;trendy&quot;. The two proceeded to write lyrics for the verses that were ultimately discarded.

===Theremin and cello===
From the start, Wilson envisioned a theremin for the track. AllMusic reviewer John Bush pointed out: &quot;Radio listeners could easily pick up the link between the title and the obviously electronic riffs sounding in the background of the chorus, but Wilson&#x27;s use of the theremin added another delicious parallel—between the single&#x27;s theme and its use of an instrument the player never even touched.&quot;

&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; does not technically feature a theremin, but rather an Electro-Theremin, which is physically controlled by a slider that turns a knob inside the instrument. It was dubbed a &quot;theremin&quot; simply for convenience. At that time, theremins were most often associated with the 1945 Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Spellbound&quot;, but their most common presence was in the theme music for the television sitcom &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;, which ran from 1963 to 1966. Britz speculates: &quot;He just walked in and said, &#x27;I have this new sound for you.&#x27; I think he must have heard the sound somewhere and loved it, and built a song around it.&quot; It is unclear whether Wilson knew that the instrument was not a real theremin.

Brian credited his brother and bandmate Carl for suggesting the use of a cello on the track. He further stated that its triplet beat on the chorus was his own idea and that it was based on the Crystals&#x27; &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; (1963), produced by Spector. Conversely, arranger and session musician Van Dyke Parks said that it was himself who suggested having the cellist play triplets to Brian. Parks believed that having Brian exploit the cello &quot;to such a hyperbolic degree&quot; was what encouraged the duo to immediately collaborate on the never-finished album &quot;Smile&quot;. At some point, Wilson asked Parks to pen lyrics for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, although Parks declined.

===Influences and final lyrics===
Wilson&#x27;s cousin and bandmate Mike Love submitted the final lyrics for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and contributed its bass-baritone vocals in the chorus. He recalled that when he heard the unfinished backing track: &quot;[It] was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, I wondered how our fans were going to relate to it. How&#x27;s this going to go over in the Midwest or Birmingham? It was such a departure from &#x27;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&#x27; or &#x27;Help Me, Rhonda.&#x27;&quot;

Love said that he wrote the words while on the drive to the studio. Feeling that the song could be &quot;the Beach Boys&#x27; psychedelic anthem or flower power offering,&quot; he based the lyrics on the burgeoning psychedelic music and Flower Power movements occurring in San Francisco and some parts of the Los Angeles area. He described the lyrics as &quot;just a flowery poem. Kind of almost like &#x27;If you&#x27;re going to San Francisco be sure to wear flowers in your hair.&#x27;&quot; Writing in his 1975 book &quot;The Beach Boys: Southern California Pastoral&quot;, Bruce Golden observed:

Capitol Records executives were worried that the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song&#x27;s production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written under the influence of marijuana, not LSD. He explained: &quot;I made &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; on drugs; I used drugs to make that. ... I learned how to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity.&quot; In Steven Gaines&#x27;s 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: &quot;We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you&#x27;d say, &#x27;I&#x27;m picking up good vibrations,&#x27; which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re really talking about.&quot;

Wilson said in 2012 that the song&#x27;s &quot;gotta keep those good vibrations&quot; bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Bandmate Al Jardine compared that section to Foster and the Negro spiritual &quot;Down by the Riverside&quot;. According to Love, the lyric &quot;&#x27;she goes with me to a blossom world&#x27; was originally meant to be followed by the words &#x27;we find&#x27;&quot;, but Wilson elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.

==Recording and production==
===Modular approach===
&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; established a new method of operation for Wilson. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or &quot;modules&quot;). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. This was the same modular approach used during the sessions for &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. To mask each tape edit, vast reverb decays were added at the mixing and sub-mixing stages.

For instrumentation, Wilson employed the services of &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;, the nickname for a conglomerate of session musicians active in Los Angeles at that time. Production for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; spanned more than a dozen recording sessions at four different Hollywood studios, at a time when most pop singles were typically recorded in a day or two. It was reported to have used over 90 hours of magnetic recording tape, with an eventual budget estimated in the tens of thousands, making it the costliest single recorded to that date. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that Wilson was so puzzled by the arranging of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; that he would often arrive at a session, consider a few possibilities, and then leave without recording anything, which exacerbated costs.

One estimate of the overall production expenses is between $50,000 and $75,000 (equivalent to $ and $ in ), By comparison, the whole of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; had cost $70,000 ($), itself an unusually high cost for an album. In 2018, Wilson disputed the $50,000 figure for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, saying that the overall expenses were closer to $25,000.

Contemporary advertisements reported $10,000 ($) as the track&#x27;s total production costs. Domenic Priore wrote that the track cost between $10,000 and $15,000 ($). When asked in a 2005 interview if it was true that the Electro-Theremin work alone cost $100,000, Wilson replied &quot;No. $15,000.&quot;

===Development===
The instrumental of the first version of the song was recorded on February 17, 1966, at Gold Star Studios and was logged as a &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; session. On that day&#x27;s session log, it was given the name &quot;#1 Untitled&quot; or &quot;Good, Good, Good Vibrations&quot;, but on its master tape, Wilson distinctly states: &quot;&#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; ... take one.&quot; After twenty-six takes, a rough mono mix completed the session. Some additional instruments and rough guide vocals were overdubbed on February 23. Brian and Carl shared vocals for this mix.

The original version of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; contained the characteristics of a &quot;funky rhythm and blues number&quot; and would not yet resemble a &quot;pocket symphony&quot;. There was no cello at this juncture, but the Electro-Theremin was present, played by its inventor, Paul Tanner. It was Brian&#x27;s second ever recorded use of the instrument, just three days after the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; track &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&quot;. Brian then placed &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; on hold in order to devote attention to the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album, which saw release on May 16. More instrumental sections for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; were recorded between April and June. Brian then forwent additional instrumental tracking until early September, when it was decided to revisit the song&#x27;s bridge section and apply Electro-Theremin overdubs.

According to Brian&#x27;s then-new friend David Anderle, during an early stage, Brian considered giving &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; to one of the black R&amp;B groups signed with Warner Bros. Records such as Wilson Pickett, and then at Anderle&#x27;s suggestion to singer Danny Hutton. He thought about abandoning the track, but after receiving encouragement from Anderle, eventually decided on it as the next Beach Boys single. In the meantime, he worked on writing and recording material for the group&#x27;s forthcoming album, &quot;Smile&quot;.

The first Beach Boy to hear &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; in a semi-completed form, other than Brian, was Carl. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: &quot;I came back up into my hotel room one night and the phone rang. It was Brian on the other end. He called me from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, that kind of stuff, and then it refined itself and got into the cello. It was a real funky track.&quot; In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song&#x27;s length and &quot;modern&quot; sound: &quot;I said no, it&#x27;s not going to be too long a record, it&#x27;s going to be just right. ... They didn&#x27;t quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn&#x27;t conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece.&quot;

The vocals for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; were recorded at CBS Columbia Square, starting on August 24 and continuing sporadically until the very last day of assembly on September 21. The episodic structure of the composition was continuously revised as the group experimented with different ideas. Brian remembers that he began recording the &quot;bop bop good vibrations&quot; parts first, and that he came up with &quot;the high parts&quot; a week later. Mike Love recalled: &quot;I can remember doing 25–30 vocal overdubs of the same part, and when I mean the same part, I mean same section of a record, maybe no more than two, three, four, five seconds long.&quot; Dennis Wilson was to have sung the lead vocal, but due to a bout of laryngitis, Carl replaced him at the last minute. In early September, the master tapes for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; were stolen. Mysteriously, they reappeared inside Brian&#x27;s home two days later.

On September 21, Brian completed the track after Tanner added a final Electro-Theremin overdub. In 1976 he elaborated on the event: &quot;It was at Columbia. I remember I had it right in the sack. I could just feel it when I dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It was a feeling of power, it was a rush. A feeling of exaltation. Artistic beauty. It was everything ... I remember saying, &#x27;Oh my God. Sit back and listen to this!&#x27;&quot;

==Composition and analysis==
===Genre and dynamics===
There are six unique sections to the piece. Music theorist Daniel Harrison refers to these sections individually as the verse, the refrain (or chorus), the &quot;first episodic digression&quot;, the &quot;second episodic digression&quot;, the &quot;retro-refrain&quot;, and the coda. Each has a distinct musical texture, partly due to the nature of the song&#x27;s recording. The track&#x27;s instrumentation changes radically from section to section, and for the AM radio standards of late 1966, the song&#x27;s final runtime (3 minutes 35 seconds) was considered a &quot;very long&quot; duration. Wilson is quoted in 1979:

He characterized the song as &quot;advanced rhythm and blues&quot;. Tom Roland of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; described the piece, &quot;with its interlocking segments—a sort of pop version of the classical sonata, consisting of a series of musical movements&quot;. &quot;New York Magazine&quot; compared it to &quot;a fugue with a rhythmic beat&quot;. John Bush compared the track&#x27;s fragmented cut-and-paste style to 1960s experimentalists such as William S. Burroughs. Music journal &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; argued that the song &quot;has as many dramatic changes in mood as a piece of serious classical music lasting more than half an hour&quot;. It explained that the song subverts pop forms to a considerable degree: 

According to historian Lorenzo Candelaria, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; has since been marketed as pop music &quot;possibly because it comes across relatively innocent compared with the hard-edged rock we have since come to know.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; called the song &quot;three minutes and thirty-six seconds of avant-garde pop&quot;. &quot;Mixdown&quot; described it as a &quot;masterpiece of avant-pop&quot;. The theremin and cello has been called the song&#x27;s &quot;psychedelic ingredient&quot;. In his book discussing music of the counterculture era, James Perrone stated that the song represented a type of impressionistic psychedelia, in particular for its cello playing repeated bass notes and its theremin. Professor of American history John Robert Greene named &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; among examples of psychedelic or acid rock. Stebbins wrote that the song was &quot;replete with sunshine [and] psychedelia&quot;. Steve Valdez says that, like &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Brian was attempting a more experimental rock style.

Comparing &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; to Wilson&#x27;s previous work &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, biographer Andrew Hickey said that the &quot;best way of thinking about [the song] is that it&#x27;s taking the lowest common denominator of &#x27;Here Today&#x27; and &#x27;God Only Knows&#x27; and turned the result into an R&amp;B track. We have the same minor-key change between verse and chorus we&#x27;ve seen throughout &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, the same descending scalar chord sequences, the same mobile bass parts, but here, rather than to express melancholy, these things are used in a way that&#x27;s as close as Brian Wilson ever got to funky.&quot; Author Jon Stebbins adds that &quot;unlike &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; the chorus of &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; projects a definite &#x27;rock and roll&#x27; energy and feel.&quot;

According to music author Rikky Rooksby, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; is an example of Brian Wilson&#x27;s growing interest in musical development within a composition, something antithetical to popular music of the time. Suppressing tonic strength and cadential drive, the song makes use of descending harmonic motions through scale degrees controlled by a single tonic and &quot;radical disjunctions&quot; in key, texture, instrumentation, and mood while refusing to develop into a predictable formal pattern. It instead develops &quot;under its own power&quot; and &quot;luxuriates in harmonic variety&quot; exemplified by beginning and ending not only in different keys but also in different modes.

===Verses and refrains (0:00–1:40)===


&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; begins without introduction in a traditional verse/refrain format, opening with Carl Wilson singing the word &quot;I&quot;, a triplet eighth note before the downbeat. The sparse first verse contains a repetition of chords played on a Hammond organ filtered through a Leslie speaker; underneath is a two-bar Fender bass melody. This sequence repeats once (0:15), but with the addition of two piccolos sustaining over a falling flute line. For percussion, bongo drums double the bass rhythm and every fourth-beat is struck by either a tambourine or a bass-drum-and-snare combination, in alternation. The beat projects a triplet feel despite being in time; this is sometimes called a &quot;shuffle beat&quot; or &quot;threes over fours&quot;. The chord progression used is i–VII–VI–V, also called an Andalusian cadence. Although the verses begin in the minor mode of E, the mode is not used to express sadness or drudgery. Occurring at the very end of these verses is a passing chord, D.

The refrain (0:25) begins in the newly tonicized relative major G, which suggests III. Providing a backdrop to the Electro-Theremin is a cello and string bass playing a bowed tremolo triplet, a feature that was an exceedingly rare effect in pop music. The Fender bass is steady at one note per beat while tom drums and tambourine provide a backbeat. This time, the rhythm is stable, and is split into four 4-bar sections which gradually build its vocals. The first section consists of only the couplet &quot;I&#x27;m picking up good vibrations/she&#x27;s giving me the excitations&quot; sung by Mike Love in his bass-baritone register; the second repeats the lines and adds an &quot;ooo bop bop&quot; figure, sung in multiple-part harmony; the third time also adds a &quot;good, good, good, good vibrations&quot; in yet a higher harmony. This type of polyphony (counterpoint) is also rare in contemporary popular styles. Each repeat of the vocal lines also transposes up by a whole step, ascending from G to A and then B. It then returns to the verse, thus making a perfect cadence back into E minor. The verse and refrain then repeat without any changes to the patterns of its instrumentation and harmony. This is unusual, in that normally, a song&#x27;s arrangement adds something once it reaches the second verse.

===Episodic digressions===

====First episode (1:41–2:13)====

The first episode (1:41+) begins disjunctively with an abrupt tape splice. The refrain&#x27;s B, which had received a dominant (V) charge, is now maintained as a tonic (I). There is harmonic ambiguity, in that the chord progression may be either interpreted as I–IV–I (in B) or V–I–V (in E). Stebbins says that this section &quot;might be called a bridge under normal circumstances, but the song&#x27;s structure takes such an abstract route that traditional labels don&#x27;t really apply.&quot; A new sound is created by tack piano, jaw harp, and bass relegated to strong beats which is subsequently (1:55) augmented by a new electric organ, bass harmonica, and sleigh bells shaken on every beat. The lone line of vocals (aside from non-lexical harmonies) is &quot;I don&#x27;t know where, but she sends me there&quot; sung in Mike Love&#x27;s upper-register baritone. This section lasts for ten measures (6 + 2 + 2), which is unexpectedly long in light of previous patterns.

====Second episode (2:13–2:56)====
Another tape splice occurs at 2:13, transitioning to an electric organ playing sustained chords set in the key of F accompanied by a maraca shaken on every beat. &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; highlights this change as the &quot;most savage edit in the track ... most people would go straight into a big splash hook-line section. Brian Wilson decided to slow the track even further, moving into a 23-bar section of church organ ... Most arrangers would steer clear of this kind of drop in pace, on the grounds that it would be chart suicide, but not Brian.&quot; Harrison says: 

The slowed pace is complemented by the lyric (&quot;Gotta keep those loving good vibrations a-happening with her&quot;), sung once first as a solo voice, with the melody repeated an octave higher the second time with an accompanying harmony. This two-part vocal fades as a solo harmonica plays a melody on top of the persistent quarter-note bass line and maraca that maintain the only rhythm throughout Episode 2. The section ends with a five-part harmony vocalizing a whole-note chord that is sustained by reverb for a further four beats. Lambert calls it the song&#x27;s &quot;wake-up chord at the end of the meditation that transports the concept into a whole new realm: it&#x27;s an iconic moment among iconic moments. As it rouses us from a blissful dream and echoes into the silence leading into the chorus, it seems to capture every sound and message the song has to say.&quot;

===Retro-refrain and coda (2:57–3:35)===

A brief break at the end of the second musical digression creates tension which leads into the final sequence of the song. The refrain reappears for an additional five measures, marching through a transpositional structure that begins in B, repeats at A, and then ends at G for an unexpectedly short single measure. The section uses a descending progression, which mirrors the ascending progression of the previous two refrains. There follows a short section of vocalizing in three-part counterpoint that references the original refrain by reproducing upward transposition. However, this time it settles on A, the concluding key of the song. By the end of &quot;Good Vibrations,&quot; all seven scale degrees of the opening E-minor tonic are activated on some level.

==Release and promotion==

In a July 1966 advertisement for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the band thanked the music industry for the sales of their album, and said that &quot;We&#x27;re moved over the fact that our Pet Sounds brought on nothing but Good Vibrations.&quot; This was the first public hint of the new single. Later in the year, Brian told journalist Tom Nolan that the new Beach Boys single was &quot;about a guy who picks up good vibrations from a girl&quot; and that it would be a &quot;monster&quot;. He then suggested: &quot;It&#x27;s still sticking pretty close to that same boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference. And it&#x27;s a start, it&#x27;s definitely a start.&quot; Derek Taylor, who had recently been engaged as the band&#x27;s publicist, is credited for coining the term a &quot;pocket symphony&quot; to describe the song. In a press release for the single, he stated: &quot;Wilson&#x27;s instinctive talents for mixing sounds could most nearly equate to those of the old painters whose special secret was in the blending of their oils. And what is most amazing about all outstanding creative artists is that they are using only those basic materials which are freely available to everyone else.&quot;

To promote the single, four different music videos were shot. The first of these—which had Caleb Deschanel as cameraman—features the group at the former fire station Engine Co. No. 27 (now the Los Angeles Fire Department Museum and Memorial) in Hollywood, CA, sliding down the fire poles, riding on the fire trucks, and roaming the streets of Los Angeles in a fashion comparable to &quot;The Monkees&quot;. The second features the group during vocal rehearsals at United Western Recorders. The third contains footage recorded during the making of &quot;The Beach Boys in London&quot;, a documentary by Peter Whitehead of their concert performances. The fourth clip is an alternative edit of the third. Brian also made a rare television appearance on local station KHJ-TV for its &quot;Teen Rock and Roll Dance Program&quot;, introducing the song to the show&#x27;s in-studio audience and presenting an exclusive preview of the completed record.
On October 15, 1966, &quot;Billboard&quot; predicted that the single would reach the top 20 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was the Beach Boys&#x27; third US number one hit, after &quot;I Get Around&quot; and &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;, reaching the top of the Hot 100 in December. It was also their first number one in Britain. The single sold over 230,000 copies in the US within four days of its release and entered the &quot;Cash Box&quot; chart at number 61 on October 22. &quot;Record World&quot; described it as &quot;highly imaginative.&quot; In the UK, the song sold over 50,000 copies in the first 15 days of its release. &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; quickly became the Beach Boys&#x27; first million-selling single. In December 1966, the record was their first single certified gold by the RIAA for sales of one million copies. On March 30, 2016, the digital single was certified platinum by the RIAA for the same sales level.

In the US, &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it is a &quot;catchy, easy-driving ditty loaded with the Boys&#x27; money-making sound.&quot; In Britain, the single received favorable reviews from the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Soon after, the Beach Boys were voted the number one band in the world in the &quot;NME&quot; readers&#x27; poll, ahead of the Beatles, the Walker Brothers, the Rolling Stones, and the Four Tops. &quot;Billboard&quot; said that this result was probably influenced by the success of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; when the votes were cast, together with the band&#x27;s recent tour, whereas the Beatles had neither a recent single nor had they toured the UK throughout 1966; the reporter added that &quot;The sensational success of the Beach Boys, however, is being taken as a portent that the popularity of the top British groups of the last three years is past its peak.&quot; In a readers&#x27; poll conducted by a Danish newspaper, Brian Wilson won the &quot;best foreign-produced recording award&quot;, marking the first time that an American had won in that category.

The single achieved sales of over 50,000 copies in Australia, being eligible for the award of a Gold Disc.

==Influence and legacy==
===Historical reception===

Virtually every pop music critic recognizes &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; as one of the most important compositions and recordings of the entire rock era. It is a regular fixture on &quot;greatest of all-time&quot; song lists and is frequently hailed as one of the finest pop productions of all time. In 2004 and 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; at number 6 in its &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, the highest position of seven Beach Boys songs cited in the list; it descended to number 53 in the 2021 edition, no longer the band&#x27;s highest ranked song due to &quot;God Only Knows&quot; being placed at number 11. In 2001, the song was voted 24th in the RIAA and NEA&#x27;s Songs of the Century list. &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; both ranked the song number one on their lists of the greatest Beach Boys songs.

The song served as an anthem for the counterculture of the 1960s. According to Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, it also helped turn around the initially poor perception of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in the US, where the album&#x27;s &quot;un-hip orchestrations and pervasive sadness [had] baffled some longtime fans, who didn&#x27;t immediately get what Wilson was trying to do.&quot; Encouraged by the single&#x27;s success, Wilson continued working on &quot;Smile&quot;, intending it as an entire album incorporating the writing and production techniques he had devised for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, the Beach Boys&#x27; follow-up single, continued his modular recording practices, spanning nearly thirty recording sessions held between May 1966 and June 1967.

In contrast to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson&#x27;s pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: &quot;I thought it was a great record. It didn&#x27;t quite have the emotional thing that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; had for me. I&#x27;ve often played &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and cried. It&#x27;s that kind of an album for me.&quot; Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, &quot;&#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; was probably a good record but who&#x27;s to know? You had to play it about 90 bloody times to even hear what they were singing about.&quot; Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of &quot;Arts Magazine&quot;, Jonathan King said: &quot;With justification, comments are being passed that &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no.&quot; In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an &quot;edit record ... It&#x27;s like &quot;Psycho&quot; is a great film, but it&#x27;s an &#x27;edit film.&#x27; Without edits, it&#x27;s not a film; with edits, it&#x27;s a great film. But it&#x27;s not &quot;Rebecca&quot; ... it&#x27;s not a beautiful story.&quot;

===Advancements===
====Recording and popular music====

&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; is credited for having further developed the use of recording studios as a musical instrument. Author Domenic Priore commented that the song&#x27;s making was &quot;unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack, or any other kind of recording&quot;. A milestone in the development of rock music, the song, together with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot;, was a prime proponent in rock&#x27;s transformation from live concert performances to studio productions that could only exist on record. Musicologist Charlie Gillett called it &quot;one of the first records to flaunt studio production as a quality in its own right, rather than as a means of presenting a performance&quot;. In a 1968 editorial for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot;, Gene Sculatti predicted:

Writing for &quot;Popmatters&quot; in 2015, Scott Interrante stated: &quot;&#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; changed the way a pop record could be made, the way a pop record could sound, and the lyrics a pop record could have.&quot; The recording contains previously untried mixes of instruments, and it was the first pop hit to have cellos in a juddering rhythm. Microtonal composer Frank Oteri said that it &quot;sounds like no other pop song recorded up to that point&quot;. According to Stebbins: &quot;This signature sound would be duplicated, cloned, commercialized, and re-fabricated in songs, commercials, TV shows, movies, and elevators to the point of completely diluting the genius of the original. But &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; was probably the quintessential &#x27;sunshine pop&#x27; recording of the century.&quot; He added that the single &quot;vaulted nearly every other rock act in their delivery of a Flower Power classic. It was just strange enough to be taken seriously, but still vibrant, happy, accessibly Beach Boys-esque pop.&quot; John Bush wrote that the single &quot;announced the coming era of pop experimentation with a rush of riff changes, echo-chamber effects, and intricate harmonies&quot;. Gillett noted: &quot;For the rest of the sixties, countless musicians and groups attempted to represent an equivalently blissful state, but none of them ever applied the intense discipline and concentration that Wilson had devoted to the recording.&quot;

Priore says that the song was a forerunner to works such as Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971) and Isaac Hayes&#x27; &quot;Shaft&quot; (1971) which presented soul music in a similar, multi-textured context imbued with ethereal sonic landscapes. In his appraisal for &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, Roland cites the song&#x27;s &quot;format&quot; as the model for recordings by Wings (&quot;Band on the Run&quot;), the Beatles (&quot;A Day in the Life&quot;), and Elton John (&quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;). The song&#x27;s approach was repeated in Queen&#x27;s 1975 single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which was similarly pieced together using different sections. Wilson praised Queen&#x27;s effort, calling it &quot;the most competitive thing that&#x27;s come along in ages&quot; and &quot;a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer—of artistic music&quot;.

====Psychedelic and progressive rock====

With &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, the Beach Boys ended 1966 as the only band besides the Beatles to have had a high-charting psychedelic rock song, at a time when the genre was still in its formative stages. Writing in 2009, Barney Hoskyns deemed it to be the era&#x27;s &quot;ultimate psychedelic pop record&quot; from Los Angeles. Interrante adds: &quot;Its influence on the ensuing psychedelic and progressive rock movements can&#x27;t be overstated, but its legacy as a pop hit is impressive as well.&quot; Former Atlantic Records executive Phillip Rauls recalled: &quot;I was in the music business at the time, and my very first recognition of acid rock—we didn&#x27;t call it progressive rock then—was, of all people, the Beach Boys and the song &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; ... That [theremin] sent so many musicians back to the studio to create this music on acid.&quot; Author Bill Martin suggested that the Beach Boys were clearing a pathway toward the development of progressive rock, writing: &quot;The fact is, the same reasons why much progressive rock is difficult to dance to apply just as much to &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; and &#x27;A Day in the Life.&#x27;&quot;

====Use of theremin====

Although the song does not technically contain a theremin, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; is the most frequently cited example of the instrument&#x27;s use in pop music. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins and increased the awareness of analog synthesizers. The notion that &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; features a theremin has been erroneously repeated in books, CD liner notes, and quotes from the recording&#x27;s participants. While having a similar sound, a theremin is an aerial-controlled instrument, unlike the Electro-Theremin.

When the Beach Boys needed to reproduce its sound onstage, Wilson first requested that Tanner play the Electro-Theremin live with the group, but he declined due to commitments. Tanner recalls saying to Wilson, &quot;I&#x27;ve got the wrong sort of hair to be on stage with you fellas&quot;, to which Wilson replied: &quot;We&#x27;ll give you a Prince Valiant wig.&quot; The Beach Boys then requested the services of Walter Sear, who asked Bob Moog to design a ribbon controller, since the group was used to playing the fretboards of a guitar. Sear remembers marking fretboard-like lines on the ribbon &quot;so they could play the damn thing.&quot; Moog began manufacturing his own models of theremins. He later noted: &quot;The pop record scene cleaned us out of our stock which we expected to last through Christmas.&quot;

In Steven M. Martin&#x27;s 1993 documentary &quot;&quot;, in which Wilson makes an appearance, it was revealed that the attention being paid to the theremin due to &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; caused Russian authorities to exile its inventor, Leon Theremin.

===Cover versions===

The song has been covered by artists such as Groove Holmes, the Troggs, Charlie McCoy, and Psychic TV. John Bush commented: &quot;&#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy &#x27;60s. Its fragmented style made it essentially cover-proof.&quot; In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album &quot;Faithful&quot;. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: &quot;Oh, he did a marvelous job, he did a great job. I was very proud of his version.&quot; Rundgren&#x27;s single peaked at number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Rundgren explained: &quot;I used to like the sound of the Beach Boys, but it wasn&#x27;t until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they were doing was really interesting—like around &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... I tried to do [the song] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much. Radio had become so formatted and so structured that that whole experience was already gone.&quot;

In 2004, Wilson re-recorded the song as a solo artist for his album &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot;. It was sequenced as the album&#x27;s closing track, following &quot;In Blue Hawaii&quot;. In this version, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was the project&#x27;s only track that eschewed the modular recording method. The song&#x27;s verses and chorus were recorded as part of one whole take, and were not spliced together.

In 2012, Wilson Phillips, a trio consisting of Wilson&#x27;s daughters Carnie and Wendy, and John Phillips&#x27; daughter Chynna, released an album containing covers of songs by the Beach Boys and the Mamas &amp; the Papas titled &quot;Dedicated&quot;. Their version of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, with Carnie Wilson on lead vocals, was released as a single from the album and peaked at number 25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s A/C chart.

&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was also interpolated on Beyoncé&#x27;s song &quot;Ya Ya,&quot; on the album &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot; (2024).

===In popular culture===
*In 1996, experimental rock group His Name Is Alive released an homage titled &quot;Universal Frequencies&quot; on their album &quot;Stars on E.S.P.&quot; Warren Defever reportedly listened to &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; repeatedly for a week before deciding that the song &quot;needed a sequel&quot;; he added: &quot;&#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; is one of the first pop hits where you can actually hear the tape edits and I think that&#x27;s wonderful.&quot; 
*The song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;I&#x27;m picking up good vibrations&quot; are quoted in Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s 1984 single &quot;She Bop&quot;. 
*In 2001, the song was used prominently in a scene with Tom Cruise, Tilda Swinton, and Kurt Russell in the psychological thriller &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;. 
*A live version of the song, from the album &quot;Live in London&quot;, appears as a playable track in the 2010 video game &quot;Rock Band 3&quot;.
*In 2019, the song was used prominently in a scene for Jordan Peele&#x27;s psychological horror thriller film &quot;Us&quot;.
*In 2024, the song was used in the first trailer for Alex Scharfman&#x27;s supernatural comedy horror film &quot;Death of a Unicorn&quot;.

==Release history==
In early 2011, the single was remastered and reissued as a four-sided 78 rpm vinyl for Record Store Day, as a teaser for the forthcoming &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; box set. It contained &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; as a B-side, along with previously released alternate takes and mixes.

===Stereo version===
Due to the loss of the original multi-track tape, there had never been an official true stereo release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. The stereo mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of Brian Wilson and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald&#x27;s software extracted individual instrumental and vocal stems from the original mono master—as the multi-track vocals remained missing—to construct the stereo version that appears on the 2012 reissue of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;.

===&quot;40th Anniversary Edition&quot;===
In celebration of its 40th year, the &quot;Good Vibrations: 40th Anniversary Edition&quot; EP was released. The EP includes &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, four alternate versions of the song, and the stereo mix of &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Away for Awhile&quot;. The EP artwork recreates that of the original 7-inch single sleeve. In 2016, the EP was reissued as a 12&quot; record for the single&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

<text>Pierre Laclède Liguest or Pierre Laclède (22 November 1729 – 20 June 1778) was a French fur trader who, with his young assistant and stepson Auguste Chouteau, founded St. Louis in 1764, in what was then Spanish Upper Louisiana, in present-day Missouri.

== Early life ==
Laclède was born on 22 November 1729 in Bedous, Béarn, France. He was one of the younger sons in his family, with parents being office-holders, authors, and scholars of some prominence. His father, and later inherited by his brother, held the position of &quot;avocat au parlement&quot; de Navarre, a traditional region including Béarn, located in Pau. His uncle, likewise, was a man of letters, writing a history of Portugal. Overall, Laclède is said to be a reflection of desire for knowledge that filled his whole family.

In 1755, Laclède migrated to New Orleans at the age of 26. It was part of the French colony known as . The cause of his trip is argued about; some historians believe he was traveling for pleasure. Others say that he was looking to make his fortune in the new lands, as done by many other younger sons. Laclède was said to have given up positions in the church or army in order to explore the new world. Over the next few years after his arrival in New Orleans, he became a highly successful fur trader. Unlike some contemporaries, he embraced the change from his family&#x27;s traditions. Historians have commented on his energy, knowledge, and good judgement, which suggest past business experience, and a greater understanding for his success as a merchant.

During this time, Laclède began to form relationships with the officials and Native Americans in the region around New Orleans. It was through many of these conversations that Laclède learned of the opportunities that awaited further north, which inspired his exploration of the Mississippi at its confluence with the Missouri and Illinois rivers.

== Personal life ==
When first arriving in New Orleans, Laclède is described as handsome. He was said to be olive-skinned with dark eyes, tall and slender. He moved like a fencer with extreme grace and ease and retained an air of command at all time. He was said to have won a swordsmanship duel in France before departure but the prize is unknown.

In New Orleans, Laclède met and fell in love with Madame Marie-Therese Bourgeois Chouteau. It is documented that they had a liaison for many years following, four children together: Jean Pierre (1758), Marie Pélagie (1760), Marie Louise (1762), and Victoire (1764) Chouteau. Madame Chouteau at the time was married to René Auguste Chouteau. Ten years her senior, Rene had owned an inn and tavern at the time of their marriage. Her mother and stepfather arranged the marriage and considered it good, as they could not give the 15-year-old girl a dowry. But Rene was reportedly an abusive husband. In addition, not long after the birth of their first son, Rene Auguste Chouteau, Jr., called Auguste, left her and their son in New Orleans and returned to France without them. 

As divorce was not allowed during that time by the Catholic Church or the state, Madame Chouteau was legally married to Rene during most of her relationship with Laclède. They were subject to gossip and the risk of Rene&#x27;s returning and claiming rights with her.

Soon after founding the post of St. Louis in 1764, Laclède wrote to Madame Chouteau, telling her to come to the colony. Later that year, after she gave birth to her fifth child and Laclède&#x27;s fourth, she traveled upriver with all their children. Laclède was said to have built a house for them and bequeathed it to them in his will. Madame Chouteau was well loved in the colony; she was kind but sensible, understanding but stubborn. Within a few years, people started referring to her as the &quot;Queen&quot; of St. Louis.

A few years after arriving to St. Louis, René, Madame Chouteau&#x27;s husband, returned to New Orleans, and required that his wife return to him. By law, he was allowed to do this. Various governmental officials tried to slow down the process of Madame Chouteau returning to her husband, sending letters that ended requiring more letters. Before further action, René Chouteau died in a drunken stupor one night, thus ending his threat.

== Founding of St. Louis ==
Laclède was sponsored by the New Orleans merchant Gilbert Antoine de Saint-Maxent in 1763 to construct a trading post near the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Maxent was offered monopolies by D&#x27;Abbadie, which were passed on to Laclède as a six-year trading monopoly with the area&#x27;s Native Americans.

Given the length and the impending winter, Laclède began prepping for the journey immediately. In August, he embarked with a small crew, which included his common law wife&#x27;s son, René-Auguste Chouteau, Jr. Though few outposts or trading posts were already set-up, many Europeans had made the journey up the Mississippi River, making the trip more monotonous than exciting. They arrived at the confluence in December. The confluence area was too marshy to build a town, so they selected a site downriver. Legend has it that St. Louis was founded on Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day of 1764. In the 1770 census of Spanish Illinois, Laclede is listed as the owner of seven enslaved Native Americans. 

The St. Louis downtown riverfront area is named Laclede&#x27;s Landing in his honor. He is also the namesake of Laclede County, Missouri, Laclede, Missouri, the Laclede Gas Company, the Pierre Laclede Honors College at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, Pierre Laclede Elementary School in St. Louis and the Pierre Laclede office tower in Clayton, Missouri. Laclede is also recognized with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

<text>Algernon Charles Gifford (18 April 1861 – 27 February 1948) was an astronomer, explorer and teacher.

Gifford was born off the Cape of Good Hope aboard the &quot;Zealandia&quot; and upon arrival in New Zealand his family settled in Oamaru. In 1880 he became a sizar at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and graduated as 14th wrangler. After Cambridge he returned to New Zealand to teach mathematics and science at Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School (1883-1889), Christ&#x27;s College (1889-1892) and Wellington College (1895-1927). He also helped create an observatory in 1912, which is named the Gifford Observatory in his honour.

In 1901 Gifford married Suzie Jones at Oamaru and had three children.

Near the end of his teaching career Gifford started to contribute regular astronomy articles to the Evening Post, one of Wellington&#x27;s daily newspapers, which later turned into an influential column. His columns were later reprinted as booklets in 14 volumes under the name &quot;In Starry Skies&quot;, and eventually combined to form an introductory textbook.

Through meeting Alexander Bickerton he became a supporter of Bickerton&#x27;s Partial impact theory and enthusiastically explored and polished the theory.

He was an apt mathematician, and one of the first people to provide evidence that craters on the Moon are the result of meteorite impact. Publications of his mathematically justified theories in 1924 and 1930 contributed to the theory, which was later confirmed. Before this time, it had been popularly believed that craters on the Moon were caused by volcanic activity.

Although best known for his enthusiastic promotion of astronomy in New Zealand, including the establishment of the observatory in his name, he was also a respected explorer. Charles Gifford was one of the early photographic documenters of much of the back country within New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. In 1939, Mount Gifford on South Island was named in his honour.

<text>The Makahiki season is the ancient Hawaiian New Year festival, in honor of the god Lono of the Hawaiian religion.

It lasts four consecutive lunar months, approximately from October/November through February/March. It is a time for men, women and chiefs to rest, strengthen the body, and have feasts of commemoration (&quot;ʻahaʻaina hoʻomanaʻo&quot;). During Makahiki labor was prohibited and days were marked for resting and feasting. The Hawaiians gave thanks to the god Lono-ika-makahiki for his care. He brought life, blessings, peace and victory to the land. They also prayed for the death of their enemies. &quot;Makaʻainana&quot; (commoners) prayed that lands of their &quot;aliʻi&quot; (chief) may be increased, and that their own physical health along with the health of their chiefs be at their fullest.

In antiquity, many religious ceremonies occurred during this festival period. Commoners stopped work, made offerings to the chief or &quot;alii&quot;, and then spent their time practicing sports, feasting, dancing, and renewing communal bonds. During the Makahiki season warfare was forbidden which was used as &quot;a ritually inscribed means to assure that nothing would adversely affect the new crops&quot;.

Today, the Aloha Festivals (originally Aloha Week) celebrate the Makahiki tradition.

==Festivities==

The Makahiki festival was celebrated in three phases:

=== Hookupu ===
Hookupu was a time of spiritual cleansing and making offerings to the gods (Hookupu). The Konohiki, a class of chiefs who managed land, acted as tax collector, collected agricultural and aquacultural products such as pigs, taro, sweet potatoes, dry fish, &quot;kapa&quot; and mats. Some offerings were in the form of forest products such as feathers. The Hawaiian people had no money or other medium of exchange. These were offered on the altars of Lono at &quot;heiau&quot; (temples) in each district. Offerings were also made at &quot;ahu&quot;, stone altars set up at the boundary lines of each &quot;ahupuaa&quot; (ridge-to-reef geographical division).

All war was outlawed to allow unimpeded passage of the image of Lono (&quot;Akua Loa&quot;, a long pole with a strip of &quot;tapa&quot; and other embellishments attached). The festival proceeded in a clockwise circle around each island as &quot;Akua Loa&quot; was carried by the priests. At each &quot;ahupuaa&quot; its caretakers presented &quot;hookupu&quot; to the image of Lono, a fertility god who caused things to grow and who gave plenty and prosperity. The &quot;Akua Loa&quot; was adorned with white &quot;kapa&quot; streamers and the king placed a &quot;niho palaoa&quot; necklace on the deity. During a specific time the deities had to be put horizontally as a “sign of homage to the king&quot;.

=== Celebrations ===
The second phase was a time of celebration: hula dancing, of &quot;paani kahiko&quot; (sports (iko. These contests, such as &quot;mokomoko&quot; (boxing), &quot;hee hōlua&quot; (sledding), &quot;kūkini&quot; (foot racing), wrestling, javelin marksmanship, bowling, surfing, &quot;waa&quot; (canoe) races, and swimming), of singing and of feasting. Some of these games were physical sports. Others were played with the mind. Individual contestants were judged and reflected on their family&#x27;s reputation. One of the best preserved lava sled courses is the Keauhou Holua National Historic Landmark. &quot;Kanaka Maoli&quot; (native Hawaians) were passionate about the mental games, which consisted of riddles, recitation of genealogies, proverbs, and knowledge of hidden meanings. Ancestors cherished these games and held them dear to their &quot;naʻau&quot;. They placed bets on favorites. Some dared to bet their lives. These games are still practiced today to help younger generations to learn about their ancestors.

=== Waa auhau ===
Finally the &quot;waa auhau&quot; (tax canoe) — was loaded with &quot;hookupu&quot; and taken out to sea where it was set adrift as a gift to Lono. At the end of the Makahiki festival, the chief went offshore in a &quot;waa&quot;. When he returned he stepped onshore and a group of warriors threw spears at him. He had to deflect or parry the spears to prove his worthiness to rule.

==Royal births==

A royal birth during Makahiki was sometimes given the name &quot;Lono i ka makahiki&quot;.

==Origin==

The ancient Hawaiians split the year into two seasons. The first was Makahiki. The second lasted eight lunar months where rituals of Kū were practiced. In &quot;Ōlelo Hawaii&quot; (Hawaiian language), Makahiki means &quot;year&quot; as well as the change from harvest time to planting time agricultural season. This probably came from &quot;Makalii hiki&quot;, the rising of the Pleiades, known in Hawaii as Makaliʻi, which occurred about this time. It may also come from &quot;ma Kahiki&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;as in Tahiti&quot;, since the legend of Lono is associated with voyages to and from Tahiti. Its origins are linked to the &quot;return&quot; of Lono, during one of the early migrations, in the form of a mortal man.

==Timing==

The beginning of Makahiki generally is fixed each year by astronomical observations. On the Island of Hawaiʻi, when Makaliʻi (Pleiades) star cluster rises shortly after sunset, usually on November 17, the following crescent moon marks the beginning. On Oʻahu, it may begin when Makaliʻi rises above Puʻu o Mahuka Heiau, as seen from Kaena Point, or when the star ʻAʻa (Sirius) appears in conjunction with a particular land form high on a cliff.

== Contact ==
The sails and masts of Captain James Cook&#x27;s ship resembled Lono&#x27;s Akua Loa. Cook&#x27;s vessel arrived at Kealakekua Bay, near a large &quot;heiau&quot; to Lono during Makahiki in 1778.

<doc id="846780" wikidata="Q4591277" url="?curid=846780" title="1996 Channel Tunnel fire">
<text>The Channel Tunnel fire of 18 November 1996 occurred on a train carrying Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) and their drivers through the Channel Tunnel from France to the United Kingdom. The fire was seen on the train as it entered the tunnel and, in line with the policy at the time, an attempt was made to drive to the UK where the fire would be dealt with. However, after an indication of a serious problem with the train, the driver stopped at 21:58 CET, into the tunnel. The locomotive and passenger coach were rapidly enveloped in thick smoke, and the locomotive lost power. Reconfiguration of the tunnel ventilation systems was delayed, but by 22:30 all passengers and crew were safe, in the service tunnel, with minor injuries.

Firefighters fought the fire overnight, and it was declared out at 11:15 the following morning. The fire damaged about of tunnel. The HGV shuttle service was suspended, and all other services restarted using single-line working in the adjacent tunnel, reducing capacity until repairs were completed. The tunnel was fully reopened, and the HGV shuttle service was restored on 15 May 1997.

Eurotunnel changed the policy of attempting to run trains on fire through the tunnel to one of stopping the train and evacuating the passengers as soon as possible.

==Fire==
The Channel Tunnel is a long undersea railway tunnel linking Folkestone in the United Kingdom with Coquelles near Calais in northern France. A diameter service tunnel is positioned between two diameter running tunnels each with standard gauge rail track with an overhead line energised at 25 kV 50 Hz. There are connecting passages from the running tunnels to the service tunnel every and piston relief ducts connect the running tunnels managing the pressure changes due to the movement of trains. Ventilation is provided from both France and the UK; in the event of a fire, a supplementary ventilation system is available. There are crossovers linking the two rail tracks at the tunnel entrances and in two caverns under the sea, dividing the running tunnels into six &#x27;intervals&#x27;. The system is controlled from a control centre in the UK terminal with a stand-by centre on the French side.

The tunnel carries through traffic in the form of high-speed Eurostar passenger trains and international rail freight trains. Two types of Eurotunnel Shuttle transport vehicles between the terminals – an enclosed type carrying coaches, cars and passengers with their vehicles and an open lattice type carrying Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGV), their drivers traveling in an amenity coach.

On 18 November 1996, at 21:48 CET a fire about 2 m by 2 m (6 ft by 6 ft) was seen on HGV Shuttle No. 7539, carrying 31 passengers and three crew, as it entered the French portal. The driver was told there was a fire on his train and that the train would be diverted to the emergency siding on arrival in the UK. When the fire was confirmed a few minutes later, the control centre restricted the speed of all trains in the tunnels to and attempted to close the piston relief ducts and doors in the crossover caverns to limit the area of the tunnel affected by smoke. Five minutes later, a train fault with risk of derailment was indicated to the driver. The train was brought to a controlled stop adjacent to a door leading to the service tunnel, at 21:58, about from the French portal. After stopping, power from the overhead line was lost and smoke filled the tunnel; crew members could not see the service tunnel doors. Smoke began to enter the coach and the crew and passengers suffered from smoke inhalation. The supplementary ventilation system was turned on and ran for seven minutes with the blades set incorrectly. Once the blades were set correctly, the smoke cleared sufficiently for the passengers and crew to evacuate. Twenty six passengers and the driver were taken out of the tunnel by a tourist shuttle that had stopped in the adjacent running tunnel. The remaining people were treated on site before being evacuated via the service tunnel. All passengers and crew were taken to a hospital in France for observation.

==Response==
Response teams were mobilised on both sides of the channel, the French team of eight firefighters leaving at 21:56 and the British team of eight firefighters leaving at 22:03. Initially, there was confusion as to the location of the train and the French team found the passengers in the service tunnel at 22:28. The driver was rescued from his cab a minute later and a search of the coach and front locomotive confirmed no-one was on board the train. With the French team treating the casualties, the fire fighting was initially left to the British team. A reconnaissance team located the fire; the British second response was requested and Kent Fire Brigade informed of the fire. While the fire fighting was being planned the French second response team arrived and took control.

The fire was located between two cross-passages and teams of firefighters from both countries fought the fire for the next five hours. Each shift of firefighters only worked in the running tunnel for short periods before returning to the service tunnel. The water supply was restricted, mainly due to leaking pipework in the south running tunnel, and the number of jets was reduced until a Eurotunnel engineer reconfigured the valves.

The fire was mostly out by 05:00 the following morning and declared extinguished at 11:15. There were no fatalities, although the people on the train suffered smoke inhalation, and there were no reported injuries to the firefighters.

==Aftermath==
Along a length of tunnel, the normally thick tunnel lining was reduced to a mean depth of , with the thinnest area being . The chalk marl showed no signs of failing or collapsing but colliery arches were installed as a precaution. Over a long section ( towards Britain, towards France), damage to the concrete extended as far back as the first set of reinforcement bars. Superficial damage to the surface of the concrete segments was evident along a further of tunnel length. In the vicinity of the fire, services were destroyed, including high-voltage cables, low-voltage cables, communications, lighting systems, traction and junction boxes over a length of . of track had to be replaced, as did of overhead line, of refrigeration pipe and signalling equipment over a length of . Four escape cross-passages and five pressure relief ducts had to be refitted with new doors and dampers. The damage was in interval 3. Service through the tunnel restarted using single track working over the parallel interval 4. In a phased re-opening, freight train service was restored on 29 November 1996, followed by Eurostar services on 4 December, and tourist shuttles on 10 December for cars and 6 January 1997 for coaches. Agreement had been reached on the repairs by 24 January 1997. The civil engineering work, repairing the tunnel wall, was completed by the French contractor Freyssinet in 60 days. This was followed by the replacement of the track, overhead line and signalling by Eurotunnel, completed in less than a month, and the tunnel was fully reopened on 15 May 1997.

The damage to the train was concentrated in the rear half. The front locomotive, amenity coach and front rake (including a truck carrying dangerous goods) suffered minor damage from heat and smoke: all were re-usable after thorough cleaning and minor repairs. The rear rake suffered major thermal damage: eleven wagons and the rear locomotive were scrapped, as were most of the HGVs being carried.

==Investigations==
Three separate investigations were conducted. The first was a French judicial inquiry into the cause of the fire, the second was an internal inquiry by Eurotunnel and the third was an inquiry by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority (CTSA), a bi-national body formed of personnel from British and French railway safety bodies, fire brigades and government departments.

The usage of the HGV shuttles had been approved with the plan that, in the event of fire, the shuttle was to either continue to the terminal or to detach the locomotive and passenger coach. Neither of these happened, as the fire had damaged the train such that it was forced to stop, and the overhead line failed four seconds after the train had come to a stand. The concept of an &#x27;unconfirmed alarm&#x27; meant that the incident was not treated seriously until five minutes after the train entered the tunnel on fire. The CTSA report recommended that all alarms be treated seriously.

The French crossover doors and one of the piston relief duct doors failed to close properly, allowing smoke to enter the other running tunnel. Furthermore, control centre staff were overwhelmed, having not been sufficiently trained for an emergency, and were using procedures and systems that were complex. This led to, for example, the supplementary ventilation system being brought online late and running incorrectly for fifteen minutes.

==Legacy==
Additional staff were placed on duty in the control room. Eurotunnel&#x27;s policy of attempting to drive trains through the tunnel in the event of an on-board fire with a backup plan of uncoupling the locomotive and amenity coach and driving out were abandoned and replaced by plans to bring trains to a controlled stop and evacuate the occupants into the service tunnel. Liaison between Eurotunnel and emergency services was improved with joint exercises and exchanges of personnel between the British and French fire brigades, so that each had experience with the other&#x27;s operational procedures. Communications were also improved.

<text>An answer song, response song or answer record is a song (usually a recorded track) made in answer to a previous song, normally by another artist. The concept became widespread in blues and R&amp;B recorded music in the 1930s to the 1950s. Answer songs were also popular in country music in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, sometimes as female responses to an original hit by a male artist or male responses to a hit by a female artist.

The original &quot;Hound Dog&quot; song sung by Big Mama Thornton reached number 1 in 1953, and there were six answer songs in response; the most successful of these was &quot;Bear Cat&quot;, by Rufus Thomas which reached number 3. That led to a successful copyright lawsuit for $35,000, which is said to have led Sam Phillips of Sun Records to sell Elvis Presley&#x27;s recording contract to RCA.

In &quot;Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society&quot; , Jim Curtis says that &quot;the series of answer songs which were hits in 1960 ... indicates the dissociation of the singer from the song ... Answer songs rode on the coattails, as it were, of the popularity of the first song, and resembled parodies in that their success depended on a knowledge of the original ... Answer songs were usually one-hit flukes by unknown singers whose lack of identity did not detract from the success of the record since only the song, and not the performer, mattered.&quot;

Today, this practice is most common in hip hop music and filk, especially as the continuation of a feud between performers; the Roxanne Wars was a notable example that resulted in over a hundred answer songs. Answer songs also played a part in the battle over turf in The Bridge Wars. Sometimes, an answer record imitated the original very closely and occasionally, a hit song would be followed up by the same artist.

<text>Pyotr Grigoryevich Bolotnikov (; 8 March 1930 – 20 December 2013) was a Soviet Track and field athlete who competed mainly in long-distance running events. He was the winner of the 10,000 metres at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Born in Zinovkino, Krasnoslobodsky District, Mordovian ASSR (now the Republic of Mordovia), Bolotnikov started athletics only at age twenty, when he joined the Soviet Army. He trained at VSS Spartak, coached by Grigory Nikiforov.

Bolotnikov won his first national championship title in 10,000 m in 1957, when he surprisingly beat the great Vladimir Kuts in a finishing straight by 0.2 seconds. He became the double Soviet champion in 5000 m and 10,000 m from 1958 to 1962. He also won the national 10,000 m title in 1964 and national cross country title in 1958. In 1959 he became the Honoured Master of Sports of the USSR.

Bolotnikov participated already at the 1956 Summer Olympics, but without any success. At the Rome Olympics in 1960, Bolotnikov controlled the 10,000 m race from the start to end, beating the main favourites Hans Grodotzki from East Germany and Murray Halberg from New Zealand by five seconds. On 5 October 1960, in Kiev, Bolotnikov lowered the 10,000 metres world record by almost twelve seconds to 28:18.8.

Just two weeks before the 1962 European Championships in Belgrade, on 11 August 1962 in Moscow, Bolotnikov lowered his own 10,000 m world record by 0.6 seconds to 28:18.2, thus becoming the main favourite at long distances at the Championships. He easily won the 10,000 m run, but was surprisingly beaten to third in 5,000 m.

After the unsuccessful 1964 Summer Olympics, Bolotnikov decided to retire from athletics in 1965. He received the Order of Lenin in 1960.

Bolotnikov died on 20 December 2013, at the age of 83.

<text>Sheico Group () is a large OEM supplier of many types of watersports apparel. The company&#x27;s headquarters is located in Yilan, Taiwan, and its manufacturing facilities are in Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. Its customers include global brands such as Billabong, Xcel, Patagonia, and ScubaPro. In 2021, Sheico Group generated $470 Million U.S. Dollars in revenue and has an estimated global market share of 65% in the wetsuit industry.

== Products ==
It manufactures goods include neoprene wetsuits, drysuits, life vests, personal flotation devices, boots, gloves, orthopedic supports and waders. Recently, the company&#x27;s product line has expanded to functional fabrics as well as sportswear OEM/ODM service.

==History==
The company was founded in 1968, as a maker of rain gears and rubber boots. By 2014, the company&#x27;s production accounted for over 60% of global market share.

In the early stages of the company development, the neoprene sheets needed to produce such a line were dearly priced and tightly controlled by a handful of Japanese suppliers. Therefore, the founder, Mr, Pi-goon Shiue, and his son, Min Shiue, were intent on bringing the neoprene in-house. By 1983, the experimentation was a success and the first neoprene production line of the company was established.

In 1996, the company&#x27;s vertical integration was expanded to create &quot;Shei Heng Hsin Sheiflex Ind. co., Ltd.&quot; and began producing spandex yarn. Two spandex manufacturing facilities were established in Taiwan and mainland China. A spandex brand, Sheiflex, is created in order to promote their spandex yarn.

Starting in the second half of 2020, the global COVID pandemic created a surge in outdoor recreation that greatly boosted the demand for wetsuits. Sheico quickly expanded its production to meet the demand and grew its revenue significantly. The company also gave back to the community by donating over US$2 million to build a covered playground complex in the Luodong Sports Park in Yilan, Taiwan.

<text>Dana Zátopková (; née Ingrová , 19 September 1922 – 13 March 2020) was a Czech javelin thrower who won a gold medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics. 

== Biography ==
At the 1952 Olympic Games, she won the gold medal in the javelin throw event at the 1952 Summer Olympics (only an hour after her husband, Emil Zátopek, won the 5,000 m), and the silver medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics. She was the European champion in 1954 and 1958. 

On 1 June 1958, she became the oldest woman in the sport of athletics to break a world record, aged 35 years, 255 days, when she threw 55.73 metres.

Zátopková and her husband were the witnesses at the wedding ceremony of Olympic gold medalists Olga Fikotová and Harold Connolly in Prague in 1957. Emil spoke to the Czechoslovak president Antonín Zápotocký to request help in Olga getting a permit to marry Connolly. While it is not clear how much this helped, they did receive a permit a few days later.

<text>Look Who&#x27;s Talking is a 1989 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Amy Heckerling and produced by M.C.E.G. Productions, Inc. and released on October 13, 1989 by Tri-Star Pictures. Starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, the film concerns the relationship between single mother Mollie (Alley) and her infant son Mikey&#x27;s babysitter, James (Travolta). Bruce Willis provides the voice of Mikey&#x27;s precocious thoughts, heard only by the audience. The film also features Olympia Dukakis, George Segal, and Abe Vigoda in supporting roles.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, but it was nevertheless an enormous box office success, grossing $297 million worldwide on its budget of $7.5 million. This success launched a titular franchise, including two sequels &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot; (1990) and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now!&quot; (1993), and a television series spin-off titled &quot;Baby Talk.&quot;

==Plot==
Mollie Jensen, an accountant living in New York City, becomes pregnant during an affair with Albert, a married client. The fetus, heard only by the audience, begins making commentary on his development. Albert assures Mollie that he will leave his wife to be with her, but in her ninth month, while out shopping, Mollie and her friend Rona catch Albert with yet another woman. Albert admits he does not plan to stay with Mollie, and the heartbreak and stress cause her to go into labor. A taxi driver, James Ubriacco, speeds through downtown traffic to get her to the hospital in time and subsequently witnesses the baby&#x27;s birth after being mistaken for the father. Mollie becomes a dedicated single mother to baby Mikey, whose thoughts the audience continues to hear.

James tracks Mollie down using the purse she left in the cab, and convinces her to allow him to use her Manhattan address to help him set up nursing care for his grandfather Vincent in exchange for his services as a babysitter. Over the next several months, James develops a bond with Mikey as Mollie goes on several failed dates in hopes of finding him a suitable stepfather. Mikey, having seen his friends&#x27; fathers at the playground, decides that James should be his father.

James, who moonlights as a flight instructor, takes Mollie flying, and she begins to fall for him. James tells Mollie that he loves her and Mikey, but she believes he is too immature to be Mikey&#x27;s father. Things get worse when Mollie is forced to work with Albert again, and he attempts to re-insert himself into Mikey&#x27;s life. When he shows up to Mollie&#x27;s apartment unannounced, James, who had thought Mollie was artificially inseminated, gets into a fight with him, and Mollie admits that it might be best for everyone if James wasn&#x27;t in Mikey&#x27;s life. Mollie allows James to say goodbye to Mikey; he gives him a few pieces of fatherly advice as Mollie listens over the baby monitor.

Mollie takes Mikey to Albert&#x27;s office to meet him, but Albert&#x27;s behavior shows that he is still too callous and selfish to be the full-time father Mikey needs, and Mollie leaves him for good. Later that day, Mollie and James are both called to Grandpa Vincent&#x27;s retirement home to intervene in a miscommunication between him and the staff. Mollie defuses the situation just as James arrives, and they make up.

Meanwhile, Mikey wanders off when he sees what he thinks is James&#x27;s taxi and ends up standing in the middle of traffic. James comes to his rescue, and Mikey says his first real word: &quot;Da-da&quot;. James and Mollie realize that Mikey already sees James as his father and they decide to give their relationship a chance, kissing passionately while Mikey considers telling them he needs a new diaper. Nine months later, Mollie gives birth to her and James&#x27; daughter and Mikey&#x27;s half-sister Julie, complete with her own inner voice.

==Cast==
* John Travolta as James Ubriacco, a taxi driver who also works as a flight instructor
* Kirstie Alley as Mollie Jensen, an accountant and Mikey&#x27;s mother
* Olympia Dukakis as Rosie Jensen, Mollie&#x27;s mother and Mikey&#x27;s grandmother
* George Segal as Albert, Mikey&#x27;s biological father
* Abe Vigoda as Vincent Ubriacco, James&#x27;s grandfather
* Bruce Willis as the voice of Mikey, Mollie&#x27;s son
** Jason Schaller, Jaryd Waterhouse, Jacob Haines, and Christopher Aydon portray Mikey as a fetus/newborn, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years, respectively
* Twink Caplan as Rona, Mollie&#x27;s co-worker and best friend
* Joy Boushel as Melissa, Albert&#x27;s interior decorator and mistress
* Joan Rivers as the voice of Julie (uncredited)

==Production==
The idea for the film came shortly after the birth of Amy Heckerling&#x27;s daughter Mollie Israel in 1985. Heckerling recalled: &quot;We&#x27;d be making up lines and I thought, this is a movie&quot;. Harold Ramis believed the character of Albert to be based on himself, as he was secretly the biological father of Heckerling&#x27;s child. Like Albert, Ramis was in the process of leaving his wife during Heckerling&#x27;s pregnancy but ultimately ended up with a third woman.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; was a surprise hit, opening at number one in the United States with $12,107,784 in its opening weekend and staying at number one for five weekends with grosses over $10 million each weekend. It eventually grossed $140,088,813 domestically and a worldwide total of $296,999,813, making it Travolta&#x27;s most successful film in eleven years since &quot;Grease&quot;, the fourth highest-grossing film of 1989, and Columbia TriStar&#x27;s highest-grossing film overseas, surpassing &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 6, 1990, and topped the country&#x27;s box office that weekend.

==Sequels==
The film was successful enough to spawn two sequels: &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot; (1990) and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now!&quot; (1993). John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, and Olympia Dukakis are the only actors to appear in all three films in the series. The success of the first two films also inspired an ABC sitcom called &quot;Baby Talk&quot;, which aired from 1991 to 1992, and featured Tony Danza as the voice of &quot;Baby Mickey&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; producer Neal H. Moritz was planning to reboot the series, with the Mikey character now grown up and the father of the baby in the film. In 2019, director Jeremy Garelick was writing the script for the reboot. In February 2020, Travolta and Alley expressed interest in reprising their roles from the original trilogy now in the role of grandparents. With Alley&#x27;s death in December 2022 from colon cancer, the status of this project is uncertain.

<text>The Piano Teacher () is a 2001 erotic psychological drama film written and directed by Michael Haneke, based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Elfriede Jelinek. It tells the story of an unmarried piano teacher (Isabelle Huppert) at a Vienna conservatory, living with her mother (Annie Girardot) in a state of emotional and sexual disequilibrium, who enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with her student (Benoît Magimel). A co-production between France and Austria, Haneke was given the opportunity to direct after previous attempts to adapt the novel by filmmakers Valie Export and Paulus Manker collapsed for financial reasons.

At the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, it won the Grand Prix, and the two leads, Huppert and Magimel, won Best Actress and Best Actor. It went on to receive positive reviews and other awards and nominations.

==Plot==
Erika Kohut is a piano professor in her late thirties at the Vienna Music Conservatory who resides in an apartment with her domineering elderly mother. Her late father had been a longstanding resident in a psychiatric asylum. Despite Erika&#x27;s aloof and assured façade, she is a woman whose sexual repression and loneliness are manifested in her paraphilia, including voyeurism, sadomasochism, and self-harm.

At a recital hosted by the Blonskij couple, Erika meets Walter Klemmer, a young aspiring engineer who also plays piano, and who expresses admiration of her talent for classical music. The two share an appreciation for composers Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert, and he attempts to apply to the conservatory to be her pupil. His audition impresses the other professors, but Erika, though visibly moved by his playing, votes against him; she cites his divergent interpretation of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Andantino&quot;, and questions his motivations. Despite this, Walter is admitted as Erika&#x27;s pupil. Meanwhile, another pupil, Anna Schober, struggles with anxiety while pushed by her own ambitious mother. When Erika witnesses Anna and Walter socialising, she slips to an empty coatroom and smashes a glass, hiding the shards inside one of Anna&#x27;s coat pockets. This cuts Anna&#x27;s right hand, preventing her from playing at the forthcoming jubilee concert.

Walter pursues Erika into a lavatory after she secretly injured Anna. Walter passionately kisses Erika, and she responds by repeatedly humiliating and frustrating him. She proceeds to give him a handjob before performing fellatio on him, but abruptly stops when he does not abide by her orders to be silent and to look at her and not to touch her. She tells him she will write him a letter regarding their next meeting. Later at the conservatory, Erika feigns sympathy for Anna&#x27;s mother, with Erika saying only she can substitute for Anna in the upcoming school concert at such short notice.

Walter is increasingly insistent in his desire to initiate a sexual relationship with Erika, but Erika is only willing if he will satisfy her masochistic fantasies. She gives him the letter indicating acts she will consent to. He follows her home and reads the letter in her bedroom, but the list repulses him and he leaves. Later that night, Erika&#x27;s mother is berating her while they lay in bed together for letting Walter in her bedroom in the middle of the night, when Erika suddenly begins kissing and groping her mother. Her mother resists and tells Erika she is unwell.

Erika finds Walter at an ice rink after his hockey practice to apologise. She begins to subjugate herself to him in a janitorial closet. Walter says he loves her and they begin to have sex, but Erika is unable to, and vomits while performing fellatio. Later that night, Walter arrives at Erika&#x27;s apartment and attacks her in the fashion described in her letter. He locks her mother away in her bedroom before proceeding to beat and rape Erika, despite her pleas for him to stop.

The next day, Erika brings a large kitchen knife to the concert where she is scheduled to substitute for Anna. When Walter arrives, he enters cheerfully, laughing with his family, and flippantly greets her. Moments before the concert is due to start, a distraught Erika calmly stabs herself in the shoulder with the kitchen knife and exits the concert hall into the street.

==Cast==
* Isabelle Huppert as Erika Kohut
* Annie Girardot as the mother
* Benoît Magimel as Walter Klemmer
* Susanne Lothar as Mrs. Schober
* Anna Sigalevitch as Anna Schober
* Udo Samel as Dr. Blonskij
* Cornelia Köndgen as Mrs. Blonskij

==Production==
===Development===

The film is based on the 1983 novel &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; by Elfriede Jelinek, who won the 2004 Nobel Prize in Literature. Director Michael Haneke read &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; when it was published and aspired to adapt it to transition from making television films to cinema. However, Haneke learned Jelinek and Valie Export had already adapted a screenplay, a project aborted due to lack of investment. Jelinek later abandoned hope for a film version before selling the rights to Paulus Manker, who asked Haneke to adapt the screenplay, though Haneke would not be the director. Manker did not secure a budget, so the producer asked Haneke to direct.

Haneke agreed to take over the directorial helm, though the screenplay had been written with Manker&#x27;s direction in mind, only if Isabelle Huppert was the star. Haneke also reorganised the novel&#x27;s story, and developed the characters of Anna Schober and her mother to mirror the Kohuts mother–daughter relationship at a past stage. In pre-production, Haneke followed Jelinek&#x27;s choices in costumes, including pleated skirts and Burberry trench coats common in Vienna conservatories.

===Casting===
Haneke had previously reached out to Huppert to star in his film &quot;Funny Games&quot; (1997), which she passed on for another professional conflict. When Haneke told her he would not direct &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; without her, Huppert skimmed the screenplay and realized its potential. She said she had studied piano as a child, quitting when she was 15, but began playing again for the film. Eva Green has an uncredited role as one of Walter&#x27;s friends.

===Filming===
Filming began on 21 August 2000 and ended on 28 October 2000.

For the scene in which Erika cuts herself in the bathtub, tubes and a pump were used for the false blood, which the props artist had to conceal from the camera under Huppert. Huppert also wore a blood bag under her clothing for the self-stabbing scene, taken from the novel. Benoît Magimel studied piano during filming to convincingly simulate his playing scenes at the end of production, while the music is playback. Susanne Lothar performed in German, but her lines were dubbed over with French in co-production.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded it three and a half stars, citing Huppert&#x27;s confidence, writing on hints of revenge against The Mother character and defending the ending, saying &quot;with a film like this any conventional ending would be a cop-out&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; credited Haneke for aptitude in creating &quot;nerve-jangling disquiet&quot; and Huppert for &quot;the performance of her career&quot;. David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised the film as &quot;audaciously brilliant&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ critic Justin Chang recalled &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; as Huppert&#x27;s best work in a Haneke film, and &quot;a major achievement in a disturbingly minor key&quot;. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described Huppert as &quot;a rich incarnation of a woman we might see on the street and never guess that she contains fires, earthquakes and infernos&quot;, comparing it to her performance in the 2016 film &quot;Elle&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; won awards on the European circuit, most notably the Grand Prix at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, with the two leads, Huppert and Magimel, winning Best Actress and Best Actor. The film was Austria&#x27;s submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but it was not nominated.

<doc id="846829" wikidata="Q167977" url="?curid=846829" title="Skunk Anansie">
<text>Skunk Anansie are a British rock band whose members include Skin (lead vocals, guitar), Cass (bass, guitar, backing vocals), Ace (guitar, backing vocals) and Mark Richardson (drums and percussion).

Skunk Anansie formed in 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name &quot;Skunk Anansie&quot; is taken from Akan folk tales of Anansi the spider-man of Ghana, with &quot;Skunk&quot; added to &quot;make the name nastier&quot;.

They have released six studio albums: &quot;Paranoid &amp; Sunburnt&quot; (1995), &quot;Stoosh&quot; (1996), &quot;Post Orgasmic Chill&quot; (1999), &quot;Wonderlustre&quot; (2010), &quot;Black Traffic&quot; (2012) and &quot;Anarchytecture&quot; (2016); one compilation album, &quot;Smashes and Trashes&quot; (2009); and several hit singles, including &quot;Charity&quot;, &quot;Hedonism&quot;, &quot;Selling Jesus&quot; and &quot;Weak&quot;.

They are often grouped as part of the Britrock movement, as opposed to the contemporary Britpop of their early years due to their overall harder sound. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;, with a total of 142 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. Skunk Anansie have sold 5 million records.

==History==
===Formation and early career: 1994–2001===
The group played its first gig at London&#x27;s Splash club in March 1994. In 1995 they were voted Best New British Band by the readers of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine. At the award ceremony that year drummer Mark Richardson met the band who were looking for a permanent replacement for Robbie France, so an audition was set up and the band was reformed. Soon after that, two of their songs, &quot;Feed&quot; and &quot;Selling Jesus&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Strange Days&quot; in 1995. &quot;Selling Jesus&quot; became Skunk Anansie&#x27;s controversial second song to receive radio play, following their first radio release &quot;Little Baby Swastikkka&quot;. After hearing this song, radio personality Howard Stern claimed that the band would become a huge hit. Success continued for the band and they were also voted &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s Best British Live Act in 1996. In 1997 they were nominated for Best Live Act and Best Group at the MTV Europe Music Awards.
The group played its first gig at London&#x27;s Splash club in March 1994, subsequently taking six weeks to record its debut album, &quot;Paranoid &amp; Sunburnt&quot;, with producer Sylvia Massy at a &quot;haunted house&quot; outside the city. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Selling Jesus,&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Strange Days&quot;; &quot;Stoosh&quot; followed in 1996. Both albums were released by One Little Indian Records. After switching to the Virgin label in 1998, their third album, &quot;Post Orgasmic Chill&quot;, was released in 1999.

In 1996, the band played a set at the Coppid Beech Hotel, Bracknell during a record label event.

In 1999, the band was the last band of the 20th Century to headline Glastonbury Festival; closing the Pyramid Stage on Sunday 27 June.

Throughout the 1990s, the group toured globally with such bands as U2, Aerosmith, Feeder, Lenny Kravitz, Bad Religion, Rollins Band, Therapy?, Rammstein, Killing Joke, Soulfly, Sevendust, Oomph!, Muse, Staind, Powerman 5000, Veruca Salt, Marion and A Perfect Circle.

Despite becoming one of the largest British acts of the 1990s and having much success throughout Europe, Skunk Anansie did not receive as much success in the U.S. However, they did have several concerts in the U.S., with their first being in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2001 before performing a second time in 2016 in Brooklyn, New York City.

===Side projects: 2002–2008===

After their split in April 2001, Skin embarked on a solo career. Her debut solo album &quot;Fleshwounds&quot;, co-written with longtime songwriting partner Len Arran was released in September 2003 and &quot;Fake Chemical State&quot; was released in March 2006. She has also provided vocals for a number of other acts&#x27; songs.

Ace released a low-key album, &quot;Still Hungry&quot;, under the name Ace Sounds, which featured many collaborations including Shingai Shoniwa from Noisettes and Skye from Morcheeba. He later joined a band called &quot;Inner Mantra&quot;. Ace is also a tutor at the Brighton Institute of Modern Music

In 2002 Cass recorded the album &quot;Scars&quot; with Gary Moore, and played bass and performed backing vocals. Cass also played various instruments on Skin&#x27;s first solo album. When not recording he concentrates on photography.

Mark recorded sessions for various artists including Skin before joining Feeder after the death of their original drummer, Jon Lee. Mark has also been tutoring at the Brighton Institute with bandmate Ace.

===Reunion: 2009–2010===

Mark Richardson confirmed reports that the band was reforming in an interview with &quot;Drummer Magazine&quot; (November 2008 issue), and said that the band planned to release a &quot;best of&quot; compilation as well as new material. Ace later set up an official page for the band on MySpace.

On 2 and 3 April 2009, two shows took place at the Monto Water Rats (the former venue of the Splash Club) in London, under the alias SCAM (Skin, Cass, Ace, Mark) and sold out in 20 minutes. The band began their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; tour on Friday, 9 October 2009 at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels, with other dates across Europe. It was their first actual tour in eight years. A &quot;greatest hits&quot; album, &quot;Smashes and Trashes&quot;, was released 2 November 2009. It is a 15-track career-embracing album and includes three brand new tracks: &quot;Because of You&quot;, &quot;Tear the Place Up&quot; and &quot;Squander&quot;. A best-of remixes companion album was also released digitally.

On 3 July 2009, the music video for &quot;Tear the Place Up&quot; was presented exclusively on MySpace, before on 10 August 2009, a new video for &quot;Because of You&quot; was presented exclusively on Kerrang.com. It was released 14 September 2009 in the UK and was the first single to be released from &quot;Smashes and Trashes&quot;. The single was a top 10 hit in Italy, before its follow-up &quot;Squander&quot; was a top 75 success in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium.

Their fifth album &quot;Wonderlustre&quot; was released internationally on 13 September 2010, preceded by the first single &quot;My Ugly Boy&quot;, which was released in the UK on 16 August 2010 and in Europe July/August. The video for &quot;My Ugly Boy&quot; was presented exclusively on Kerrang.com on 23 July 2010. &quot;Wonderlustre&quot; reached number one on the Italian albums chart on 1 October 2010 and placed in the top 10 in charts all over Europe including in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Poland.

In May 2010 they were a supporting act for Rammstein, during two concerts in Berlin. The second single from &quot;Wonderlustre&quot;, &quot;Over the Love&quot; was released internationally in November 2010. In November 2010 the band played on &quot;Ídolos&quot;, a Portuguese equivalent to the UK&#x27;s &quot;Pop Idol&quot;.

&quot;You Saved Me&quot;, the third single from &quot;Wonderlustre&quot; was released internationally in March 2011.

===Continuing career: 2011–present===

On 12 June 2011, the band performed at the open air Rock on the Volga festival at Samara, Russia. The performance was exceptionally well-received. The band also appeared on Friday 12 August at Sziget Festival in Budapest, Hungary playing a mixed set of hits and newer material. This was their first appearance at Sziget. Sziget&#x27;s own website reporting &quot;nobody had any doubts who the Queen of this year&#x27;s Sziget turned out to be&quot;.

Skunk Anansie was on stage when the tragedy occurred at Pukkelpop in Belgium on 18 August 2011. As the band was performing a small tornado hit the venue and artists and revellers alike were sent running for their lives. Five were killed whilst several more were injured. Singer Skin described the incident as the most terrifying of her life.

Former drummer Robbie France died on 14 January 2012 in Spain. He was 52.

On 11 June 2012, Skunk Anansie revealed the title for their 5th studio album: &quot;Black Traffic&quot;. The band&#x27;s follow-up to 2010&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Wonderlustre&quot; was recorded in London and produced by Skunk Anansie and Chris Sheldon and mixed by Jeremy Wheatley and Adrian Bushby.

&quot;Black Traffic&quot; became the band&#x27;s first independent release via their own label working in partnership with 100% Records. The album was released in September 2012 release and was backed by the first leg of an extensive 20 date European Tour. On 29 June 2012, the band released the lyric video for a new track called &quot;Sad, Sad, Sad&quot;. Nick Bassett praised the track on his site The Re-View:
&quot;Thrashing percussion and Skin&#x27;s vocal – she remains one of the UK&#x27;s greatest and most underrated female vocalists – are all in check as the band return to the heavy rock sound that first shot them into the mainstream in the mid-nineties.&quot;
In September 2013, the band released their seventh album, &quot;An acoustic Skunk Anansie – Live in London&quot; which was recorded live at Cadogan Hall in April of that year. The album was also released as a live DVD and was described by the band as &#x27;a family affair&#x27; as it featured Skin&#x27;s longtime writing partner Len Arran on guitar and Erika Footman, Mark&#x27;s wife on backing vocals and keyboards.

On 15 January 2016, Skunk Anansie released their sixth studio album &quot;Anarchytecture&quot;, and embarked upon an extensive European tour in February 2016 and throughout Summer 2016.

In 2017, Skunk Anansie turned their influence to help young aspiring musicians and launched the first ever Skunk Anansie scholarship in conjunction with The Academy of Contemporary Music. The band pick one successful applicant from either ACM Guildford, ACM London or ACM Birmingham and offer them £27,000 of funding for their degree course. The scholarship was again awarded the following year.

In September 2018, the band announced they’d be releasing the very special live album, 25LIVE@25 through Republic of Music in celebration of their forthcoming 25th anniversary. It was released 25 January 2019 and features 25 tracks taken from across their six studio albums, which were captured live from various performances on their 2017 tour.

Continuing the 25th anniversary celebrations Skunk Anansie will be touring Europe throughout the summer of 2019, headlining festivals and their own shows, finishing with a string of UK shows

Across the UK and European media the importance of the band in today&#x27;s culture has been given renewed prominence. The UK media have embraced the band once more with Skin appearing in interviews for the likes of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, &quot;Newsnight&quot;, &quot;The One Show&quot;, ITN, and Radio 2 discussing current political and social issues. The band have also been hailed as one of the most important rock bands of the modern age rock across a broad spectrum of UK press titles, and were the recipients of the Hall of Fame Award at the 2019 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards on 19 June 2019.

The single &quot;What You Do For Love&quot; was released in 2019. The black and white video for the song shows Skunk Anansie in concert. &quot;This Means War&quot; followed in 2020. At the beginning of 2022, the singles &quot;Piggy&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Take You Anywhere&quot; were released, but there was no announcement of a new album.

Skunk Anansie singer Skin received her OBE from King Charles on 7th February 2023 at Windsor Castle.

In February 2025 the band announced their seventh studio album The Painful Truth to be released 23rd May 2025.

<doc id="846830" wikidata="Q1338357" url="?curid=846830" title="Emmanuel Liais">
<text>Emmanuel Liais (15 February 1826 – 5 March 1900) was a French-Brazilian 
astronomer, botanist and explorer who spent many years in Brazil.

He was born in Cherbourg, the son of a wealthy family in the shipbuilding industry.

He was an amateur scientist and made some meteorological observations and wrote some papers. The astronomer François Arago took note of one of his papers written in 1852, which determined that the weather in his hometown was milder than that of Paris.

He then went to Paris in 1854 and worked at the Paris Observatory. There he assisted Urbain Le Verrier in creating a telegraphic meteorological network. He went to Brazil to observe the solar eclipse of September 7, 1858 and ended up staying there for a long time. He became a close acquaintance of the Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II, and became the director of the Imperial Observatory at Rio de Janeiro from January to July 1871 and again from 1874 to 1881.

Although the observatory had been founded in 1827, in reality it was occupied mostly with teaching students of military schools. Liais reorganized it to concentrate on research.

He discovered the comet C/1860 D1 (Liais). This was his only comet discovery and the first comet discovered in Brazil.

He made astronomical observations of Mars and in 1865 speculated that the dark albedo features were vegetation and not water (in fact, as we know today, they are neither).

At the behest of the emperor, he made extensive exploration expeditions within Brazil and studied the plants of remote regions, sending some of them to France. He wrote a book entitled &quot;Climats, géologie, faune et géographie botanique du Brésil&quot; (Paris: Garnier Frères, 1872).

In 1878 a public dispute developed between him and Manoel Pereira Reis and his position at the observatory gradually became untenable. At the beginning of 1881 he resigned and returned to his hometown of Cherbourg.

He was mayor of Cherbourg from 1884–1886 and again from 1892 until his death in 1900. He imported exotic plants from South America and Asia to Cherbourg.

He married a Dutch woman, Margaritha Trovwen, and they had no children. He bequeathed his property, located in a magnificent botanical park, to the city of Cherbourg. It is now known as the Emmanuel Liais Gardens.

A crater on Mars is named after him. In addition to the park named after him, there is also &quot;Emmanuel Liais&quot; street in Cherbourg.

<doc id="846849" wikidata="Q1429314" url="?curid=846849" title="High Definition Compatible Digital">
<text>High Definition Compatible Digital (HDCD) is a proprietary audio encode-decode process that claims to provide increased dynamic range over that of standard Compact Disc Digital Audio, while retaining backward compatibility with existing compact disc players.

Originally developed by Pacific Microsonics, the first HDCD-enabled CD was released in 1995. In 2000, the technology was purchased by Microsoft, and the following year, there were over 5,000 HDCD titles available. Microsoft&#x27;s HDCD official website was discontinued in 2005; by 2008, the number of available titles had declined to around 4,000.

A number of CD and DVD players include HDCD decoding, and versions 9 and above of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Media Player on personal computers are capable of decoding HDCD.

HDCD is a favorite among artists who have a preference for high quality sound, such as Neil Young, the Beach Boys and the Grateful Dead—all of whom have multiple CD titles (new and archival) in their catalogs mastered in this process.

==Technical overview==
HDCD encodes the equivalent of 20 bits worth of data in a 16-bit digital audio signal by using custom dithering, audio filters, and some reversible amplitude and gain encoding:

* Peak Extend, which is a reversible soft limiter; 
* Low Level Range Extend, which is a reversible gain on low-level signals.

There is thus a benefit at the expense of a very minor increase in noise.

The claim that the encoding process is compatible with ordinary CD players (without audible distortion) is disputed: not being able to decode the peak soft limiting, a normal CD player will output distorted peaks.

==History==
HDCD technology was developed between 1986 and 1991 by &quot;Prof.&quot; Keith O. Johnson and Michael &quot;Pflash&quot; Pflaumer of Pacific Microsonics Inc. It was made publicly available as HDCD-enabled audio CDs (often identifiable by the HDCD logo printed on the back cover) in 1995.

Between 1996 and 1999 Pacific Microsonics VP of OEM Sales, Steve Fields, made over 20 trips to Japan, visiting Sanyo, Burr-Brown Japan and major audio companies, with the intent of licensing the HDCD technology. In 1998, Burr-Brown (now part of Texas Instruments) and Sanyo Electronics of Japan introduced low-cost digital-to-analog converters with HDCD decoding included, allowing HDCD to be used in CD and DVD players in the $100 range. HDCD algorithms were included in DVD chips from many IC makers including Motorola and C-Cube, allowing HDCD to be offered by mass-market DVD player makers such as Panasonic and Toshiba.

In 2000, Pacific Microsonics folded and Microsoft acquired the company and all of its intellectual property. Microsoft discontinued the official HDCD website in 2005.

In January 2007, there were roughly the same number of titles available on SACD as on HDCD-encoded CDs.

==Hardware players==
A number of manufacturers offer players with HDCD capability. Some Panasonic DVD players and the Oppo line of players all feature HDCD decoding. Several Yamaha Blu-ray players as well as Emotiva CD players decode HDCD.

==Software players==
===Windows Media Player===
Since version 9 of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Media Player (WMP) HDCD enabled CDs can be played on personal computers fitted with a 24-bit sound card.

With some HDCD discs and some DVD players using WMP, the first track may not be recognized as HDCD, but all subsequent tracks are. This is because HDCD has a control signal, and if the signal is not detected by WMP at the beginning of the song, the HDCD decoder is not activated.

===Other software===
In 2007, a member of the Doom9 forum authored a Windows CLI utility, &quot;hdcd.exe&quot;, to extract and decode the HDCD data in 16-bit WAV files ripped from HDCD discs. This utility writes 24-bit WAV output files with four bits of padding per sample. The author of the utility decided not to make the source code publicly available as the HDCD technology is patented.

Illustrate&#x27;s &quot;dBpoweramp Music Converter&quot;, a Windows GUI program, has an HDCD DSP effect that acts as a front-end to the utility listed above.

A plugin is available for &quot;foobar2000&quot; that will decode HDCD data in any 16-bit PCM passed through it, resulting in a 20-bit PCM stream.

FFmpeg&#x27;s &quot;libavfilter&quot; includes an HDCD filter as of &quot;FFmpeg 3.1&quot; (June 2016) that will convert 16-bit PCM with HDCD data to 20-bit PCM.

An open-source HDCD decoder library exists as &quot;libhdcd&quot;.
