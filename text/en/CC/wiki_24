<text>The Maji Maji Rebellion (, ) was an armed rebellion of Africans against German colonial rule in German East Africa (modern-day Tanzania). The war was triggered by German colonial policies designed to force the indigenous population to grow cotton for export. The war lasted from 1905 to 1907, during which 75,000 to 300,000 died, overwhelmingly from famine. The end of the war was followed by a period of famine, known as the Great Hunger (&quot;ukame&quot;), caused in large part by the scorched-earth policies used by governor von Götzen to suppress the rebellion. These tactics have been described by scholars as genocidal. The name may have been the origin of the term for the &#x27;Mau Mau rebellion&#x27; in Kenya five decades later.

== Causes ==
After the Scramble for Africa among the major European powers in the 1880s, Germany reinforced its hold on several formal African colonies. These were German East Africa (Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and part of Mozambique), German Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia), Cameroon, and Togoland (today split between Ghana and Togo).

The Germans had a relatively weak hold on German East Africa. However, they maintained a system of forts throughout the interior of the territory and were able to exert some control over it. Since their hold on the colony was weak, they resorted to using violently repressive tactics to control the population.

Germany levied head taxes in 1898 and relied heavily on forced labour to build roads and accomplish various other tasks. In 1902, governor of German East Africa, Gustav Adolf von Götzen ordered villages to grow cotton as a cash crop for export. Each village was charged with producing a quota of cotton, despite the fact that the high water requirements of cotton made it impossible to grow in most of the country. The headmen of the village were put in charge of overseeing the production, which set them against the rest of the population. The German government also introduced laws to protect forests and wildlife. While these measures may have been desirable in theory, they led to great hardship for the African population, not least because of an increase in wild pigs, which did enormous damage to food crops.

The German policies were very unpopular, as they had serious effects on the lives of local peoples. The social fabric of society was rapidly changing: as the roles of men and women were being changed, they had to adapt for the communities. Since men were forced away from their homes to work, women had to take on some of the traditional male roles. Also, the men&#x27;s absence strained the resources of the village, and the people&#x27;s ability to deal with their environment and remain self-sufficient. In 1905, a drought threatened the region. All that, as well as opposition to the government&#x27;s agricultural and labour policies, led to open rebellion against the Germans in July.

In the aftermath of the rebellion, Governor von Götzen initiated an inquiry into the causes of the rebellion. Sunseri has summarised the results of the inquiry as follows:Ultimately members of the commission disagreed on the nature of the uprising, dividing between those who saw it as an irrational movement spawned by sorcerers and headmen making use of &quot;maji&quot; water medicine, disgruntled because they had been steadily losing influence since the advent of colonial rule, and those who dismissed the role of spirit mediums and emphasized the burdens created by German administration. The governor&#x27;s circle cultivated the image of an atavistic, superstitious movement rooted in traditional beliefs so as to insulate their policies from close scrutiny. In 1909 Götzen published a history of the rebellion. John Iliffe has said of this work that it is &quot;remarkable for containing no reference whatever to the cotton scheme which the author had initiated,&quot; and he calls it &quot;an account of atavistic conspiracy.&quot;

==Uprising==
The insurgents turned to magic to drive out the German colonizers and used it as a unifying force in the rebellion. A spirit medium named Kinjikitile Ngwale, who practiced folk Islam that incorporated animist beliefs, claimed to be possessed by a snake spirit called Hongo. Ngwale began calling himself Bokero and developed a belief that the people of East Africa had been called upon to eliminate the Germans. German anthropologists recorded that he gave his followers war medicine that would turn German bullets into water. This &quot;war medicine&quot; was in fact water (&quot;maji&quot; in Kiswahili) mixed with castor oil and millet seeds. Empowered with this new liquid, Bokero&#x27;s followers began what would become known as the Maji Maji Rebellion.

The followers of Bokero&#x27;s movement were poorly armed with spears and arrows, sometimes poisoned. However, they were numerous and believed that they could not be harmed because the Germans&#x27; bullets would turn to water. They marched from their villages wearing millet stalks around their foreheads. Initially, they attacked small outposts and damaged cotton plants. On 31 July 1905, Matumbi tribesmen marched on Samanga and destroyed the cotton crop as well as a trading post. Kinjikitile was arrested and hanged for treason. Before his execution, he declared that he had spread the medicine of the rebellion throughout the region. On 14 August 1905, Ngindo tribesmen attacked a small party of missionaries on a safari; all five, including Bishop Spiss (the Roman Catholic Bishop of Dar es Salaam) were speared to death.

Soon the Yao tribes started participating and throughout August the rebels moved from the Matumbi Hills in the southern part of what is now Tanzania and attacked German garrisons throughout the colony. The attack on Ifakara, on 16 August, destroyed the small German garrison and opened the way to the key fortification at Mahenge. Though the southern garrison was quite small (there were but 458 European and 588 native soldiers in the entire area), their fortifications and modern weapons gave them an advantage. At Mahenge, several thousand Maji Maji warriors (led by another spirit medium; not Bokero) marched on the German cantonment, which was defended by Lieutenant Theodor von Hassel with sixty native soldiers, a few hundred loyal tribesmen, and two machine guns. The two attacking tribes disagreed on when to attack and were unable to co-ordinate. The first attack was met with gunfire from 1000 meters; the tribesmen stood firm for about fifteen minutes, then broke and retreated. After the first attack, a second column of 1,200 men advanced from the east. Some of these attackers were able to get within three paces of the firing line before they were killed.

While this was the apex of the uprising, the Ngoni people decided to join in the revolt with a force of 5,000. The Gwangara Ngoni were relatively recent arrivals in the region, descendants of a remnant of the Ndwandwe confederation defeated by the Zulus in 1818 (other Ngoni states were formed in Malawi, Zambia, and north-central Tanzania). German troops, armed with machine guns, departed from Mahenge to the Ngoni camp, which they attacked on 21 October. The Ngoni soldiers retreated, throwing away their bottles of war medicine and crying, &quot;The maji is a lie!&quot; Upon the outbreak of the fighting, Count Gustav Adolf von Götzen, governor of German East Africa, had requested reinforcements from the German government. Kaiser Wilhelm immediately ordered two cruisers with their Marine complements to the troubled colony. Reinforcements also arrived from as far away as New Guinea. When 1,000 regular soldiers from Germany arrived in October, Götzen felt he could go on the offensive and restore order in the south.

Three columns moved into the rebellious South. They destroyed villages, crops, and other food sources used by the rebels. They made effective use of their firepower to break up rebel attacks. A successful ambush of a German column crossing the Rufiji River by the Bena kept the rebellion alive in the southwest, but the Germans were not denied for long. By April 1906, the southwest had been pacified. However, elsewhere the fighting was bitter. A column under Lieutenant Gustav von Blumenthal (1879–1913, buried at Lindi) consisting of himself, one other European and 46 Askaris fell under continuous attack as it marched in early May 1906, from Songea to Mahenge. The Germans decided to concentrate at Kitanda, where Major Kurt Johannes, Lieutenants von Blumenthal and Friedrich Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau eventually gathered. Von Blumenthal was then sent along the Luwegu River, partly by boat. The southeast campaign degenerated into a guerrilla war that brought with it a devastating famine.

The German scorched earth policy deliberately caused famine among the population. Von Götzen was willing to pardon the common soldiers who gave up their weapons, leaders and traditional healers. However, he also needed to flush out the remaining rebels and so chose famine. In 1905, one of the leaders of German troops in the colony, Captain Wangenheim, wrote to von Götzen, &quot;Only hunger and want can bring about a final submission. Military actions alone will remain more or less a drop in the ocean.&quot; Germany&#x27;s tactics have been described as genocidal by scholars such as A. Dirk Moses and Klaus Bachmann. 

Not until August 1907 were the last embers of rebellion extinguished. In its wake, the rebellion had left 15 Germans, 73 askaris, 316 ruga ruga, and tens or even hundreds of thousands of insurgents and local civilians dead.

==Aftermath and interpretation==
The Abushiri revolt of 1888–1889 and the Wahehe Rebellion of 1891–1898 are viewed by historians as precursors of the Maji Maji uprising. The suppression of the Maji Maji people changed the history of southern Tanzania. Tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of people died or were displaced from their homes. In the wake of the war, the imperial government instituted administrative reforms under the governorship of Albrecht von Rechenberg. The rebellion became a focal point in the history of the region. Journalist John Gunther noted in 1953 that &quot;even today the Southern Province of Tanganyika, the &#x27;Cinderella Province,&#x27; has not fully recovered from the German terror half a century ago. The economy of the region has never been successfully rebuilt.&quot; Later Tanzanian nationalists used it as an example of the first stirrings of Tanzanian nationalism, a unifying experience that brought together all the different peoples of Tanzania under one leader, in an attempt to establish a nation free from foreign domination.

Later historians have challenged that view and claimed that the rebellion cannot be seen as a unified movement but rather a series of revolts conducted for a wide range of reasons, including religion. The Ngoni chiefs were offered Christian baptism before execution. Many people in the area itself saw the revolt as one part of a longer series of wars continuing since long before the arrival of Germans in the region. They cite the alliance of some groups with the Germans to further their own agendas.

The role of Islam in the rebellion is a matter for debate. In a recent review of the evidence, Jörg Haustein concludes that the contention that Islam was a factor &quot;is not warranted by historical sources and established scholarship about the Maji Maji War.&quot;

John Iliffe interprets the rebellion as a &quot;mass movement [which] originated in peasant grievances, was then sanctified and extended by prophetic religion, and finally crumbled as crisis compelled reliance on fundamental loyalties to kin and tribe&quot;. Patrick Redmond describes the rebellion as &quot;Tanzania&#x27;s most spectacular manifestation of the rejection of colonial rule&quot; but which had only a &quot;slight chance of success&quot;.

<doc id="851261" wikidata="Q3167256" url="?curid=851261" title="Herzog (video game)">
<text>(; ) is a strategy video game released by Technosoft in Japan for the MSX and NEC PC-88 computers in 1988. It was a real-time tactics and tactical shooter game with real-time strategy elements. The game served as the prototype for its sequel &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;, which was released in 1989 for the Sega Mega Drive and is often considered the first true real-time strategy game.

==Overview==
The game is centered around a fictional war between the countries of Mercies (Blue side in game) and Ruth (Red side in game). In the single player mode of the game, the player takes control of the Mercies army, whose goal is to reach and capture the headquarters of the Ruth army.

Gameplay takes place among nine battlegrounds, beginning at the capital of Mercies, Vaxan. Each victory for the player brings the player&#x27;s army to the next battleground and closer to Remerje, the capital of Ruth. The game ends when either the player is defeated at Vaxan, or the computer controlled army is defeated at Remerje. The game will also end if the player loses the last Land-Armor in stock (see Units below). If the player loses at a battleground other than Vaxan, the player will move backwards and complete the previous stage again.

==Plot==
Ten years prior to the game&#x27;s events, President Hughes, head of the Republic of Mercies, is assassinated. The Ruth Liberian Army, a terrorist organisation led by Roger Tense, takes responsibility for the act. The previously friendly relations between Mercies and Ruth deteriorate and war breaks out. Major powers intervene in the conflict on both sides, and the war spreads to engulf the world. A decade later, Ruth&#x27;s army is at the gates of Vaxan, capital of Mercies, and the war begins to draw to a close.

If the player is successful and captures Remerje, capital of Ruth, the war ends and the two countries sign a peace treaty five years later.

== Gameplay mechanics ==
Each battleground is a linear path in which the player&#x27;s base is located on one side and the enemy base is located on the other side. Each side has a Land-Armor that can fly in the air or travel on the ground, pick up and drop other friendly units, and attack units (including friendly ones). Each side must use their funding, which is automatically replenished at a rate of ten money units every half-second approximately, to build various units that will travel the length of the battlefield while doing battle with opposing units. If a unit successfully manages to reach the opposing end of the battlefield, the unit will cause a certain amount of damage to the enemy base. The battle is over when a side manages to damage the opposing base enough to destroy it.

The visual aspect of the gameplay is represented by a vertically aligned graphical area where units are controlled in real-time, and a small horizontal radar at the top of the screen where units are represented by colored dots which scroll across the screen according to their position. At the bottom of the screen, each side has gauges the show the percentage of damage taken by their respective Land-Armors and Bases. When either reaches 100 percent damage, they will be destroyed.

The gameplay in two-player mode is essentially the same as in the single player game. The graphical area is split into two sides for each player, with player one being blue and player two being red. The only major difference is that the first battle takes place at the location in the middle of the two capitals and will progress forward or backward depending on who wins, until one capital is defeated.


== Units ==
During combat, the deployable units available are as follows:

Land-Armor - The Land-Armor is the most important unit in the game. Only one Land-Armor at a time can be active on the battleground and is directly controlled by the player (the other units move independently). The Land-Armor can travel on the ground or hover in the air and attack enemy ground and air units. The Land-Armor can also pick up other units and drop them a different locations. The Land-Armor&#x27;s health is displayed on screen and will be replaced by another Land-Armor when destroyed. The computer controlled army has an infinite number of Land-Armors, but the player does not and must buy extras if needed. The destruction of the player&#x27;s last Land-Armor results in an automatic game over.

Soldier - Soldiers are fairly slow moving ground units that fire single shots at other ground enemies. Soldiers are weak and can only take one hit before being destroyed, but they are very cheap to create and when a Land-Armor picks one up, it can repair the Land-Armor at a rate of 1 percentage point per second (this is the only way to repair the Land-Armor). The Land-Armor can carry five Soldiers at a time.

Tank - Tanks are the main attack unit of an army. They are fairly expensive to make and slow moving, but they can take a lot of hits before being destroyed, and do a lot of damage to bases. A Tank&#x27;s rate of fire is about the same as a Soldier. The Land-Armor can carry one Tank at a time.

AAM (Anti Aircraft Missile)-Carrier - AAM-Carriers are medium speed moving units that are not equipped to attack ground units. Instead, they are armed with a finite number of homing missiles that can seek and attack the enemy Land-Armor on the ground and in the air. They are the only other unit that can attack the Land-Armor in the air besides another Land-Armor. The Land-Armor can carry one AAM-Carrier at a time, and upon pressing the fire button, the Land-Armor can unleash the entire payload of homing missiles the AAM-Carrier is holding.

Side Car - Side Cars are lightweight, inexpensive, motorcycle units that are fast and can reach the enemy base quickly. They also have a higher rate of fire than other units and can do damage a little faster. Their downside is that they have a low tolerance for damage. The Land-Armor can carry one Side Car at a time.

Antitank-Gun - Antitank-Guns are ground turrets that must first be placed by the Land-Armor, then they attack enemies from that position. Although they are expensive and unable to move without assistance, they are very durable and have a high rate of fire, making them ideal to take out tanks as the name suggests, or to defend bases. The Land-Armor can carry one Antitank-Gun at a time.

Grand-Slam - Being the most expensive unit next to the Land-Armor, the Grand-Slam missile is very powerful. It travels across the battleground very slowly, and if it successfully reaches the opposing base, it automatically destroys it with 100 percent damage. The Grand-Slam can&#x27;t be seen or interacted with on the graphical area and can only be seen as a blip on the radar (the game will flash a warning when a Grand-Slam is launched). The only way to destroy a Grand-Slam is to send another Grand-Slam to collide with it on the opposite end of its path.

As a final note, the player can only have a maximum of 50 units out on the battleground at a time.

== Version differences ==
The MSX2 version of the game features nine cities to fight over. The PC-88 and Sharp X1 versions have different visuals and only five contested cities. The AI scripts between the two versions also differ slightly.

==&quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;==

&quot;Herzog&quot; served as the prototype for its more well known 1989 Sega Mega Drive sequel &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;, which is considered the first real time strategy game. It was the first with a feature set that falls under the contemporary definition of the genre, predating the genre-popularizing &quot;Dune II&quot; (1992).

<text>Herzog is a 1964 novel by Saul Bellow, composed in part of letters from the protagonist Moses E. Herzog. It won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction and the Prix International. In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it one of the 100 best novels in the English language since &quot;Time&quot;″s founding in 1923.

==Plot summary==
The novel follows five days in the life of cultural history professor Moses E. Herzog, who at age 47 is having a midlife crisis and burnout following the divorce from his second unfaithful wife. He has two children, one by each wife, and is in a relationship with a vibrant woman, Ramona, but is getting cold feet and running away from the commitment. 

Herzog spends much of his time both on intense and often hilarious intellectual reflection and mentally writing letters he never sends. These letters are aimed at friends, family members, and famous figures, including historical recipients who are dead or whom he never knew. The one common thread is that Herzog is always expressing disappointment, either his own in the failings of others or their words, or apologizing for the way he has disappointed others.

Herzog&#x27;s second wife Madeleine has recently left him for Valentine Gersbach, whom Herzog considered a close friend and had helped in many ways. While still married, Madeleine convinced Herzog to move her and their daughter June to Chicago and to arrange for Gersbach and his wife Phoebe to move as well. The plans were a ruse, and shortly after arriving in Chicago, Madeleine throws Herzog out and attempts to have him committed to an asylum.

The novel opens with Herzog in his house in Ludeyville, a fictional town in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts. He is contemplating returning to New York to see Ramona, but instead flees to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard to visit some friends. He arrives at their house, but writes an actual note saying that he has to leave.

Herzog then heads to New York, and after spending a night with Ramona he heads to the courthouse to discuss with his lawyer the possibility of regaining custody of his daughter June. He subsequently witnesses a series of court hearings, including one in which a woman is charged with beating her three-year-old to death by flinging him against a wall. Moses, already distraught after receiving a letter from June&#x27;s babysitter about an incident in which Valentine locked June in the car while he and Madeleine argued inside the house, heads to Chicago. He goes to his stepmother&#x27;s house and picks up his deceased father&#x27;s antique pistol with two bullets in it, forming a vague plan to kill Madeleine and Valentine and run off with June.

The plan goes awry when Herzog sees Valentine giving June a bath and realizes that she is in no danger. The next day, after taking his daughter to the Museum of Science and the aquarium in Jackson Park, Herzog crashes his car and is charged with possession of a loaded weapon, the antique pistol. His brother, the rational Will, picks him up to try to help get him back on his feet. Herzog heads to Ludeyville, where his brother meets him and tries to convince him to check himself into an institution, which Herzog has considered but ultimately decides against. To Will&#x27;s surprise, Ramona joins them for dinner, and Herzog begins making plans to fix up the house, which, like his life, needs repair but is still structurally sound. Herzog closes by saying that he needs to write no more letters. 

In flashbacks throughout the novel, other critical details of Herzog&#x27;s life come to light, including his first marriage to Daisy, their son Marco, the life of Herzog&#x27;s father, and Herzog&#x27;s sexual molestation by a stranger on a Chicago street.

==Style==

&quot;People don&#x27;t realize how much they are in the grip of ideas&quot;, Bellow once wrote. &quot;We live among ideas much more than we live in nature.&quot; Herzog is such a person. In fact, he considers his addiction to ideas to be his greatest virtue. Herzog&#x27;s ideas, as expressed in his letters, are brilliant and seductive; &quot;After &quot;Herzog&quot;&quot;, the New York Times book reviewer exulted, &quot;no writer need pretend in his fiction that his education stopped in the eighth grade.&quot; But, said Bellow in an interview, Herzog &quot;comes to realize at last that what he considers his intellectual &#x27;privilege&#x27; has proved to be another form of bondage.&quot; It is only when he has loosened this bondage and gotten in touch with the &quot;primordial person&quot; who exists outside this ideology that Herzog can &quot;achieve the experience of authentic being.&quot;

The story is told entirely from Herzog&#x27;s point of view, alternating between first-person and third-person. Of the protagonist&#x27;s pervasive consciousness, Irving Howe wrote: &quot;We are made captive in the world of Herzog ... the consciousness of the character forms the enclosing medium of the novel.&quot; In typical Bellow style, the descriptions of characters&#x27; emotions and physical features are rich in wit and energy. Herzog&#x27;s relationships are the central theme of the novel, not just with women and friends, but also society and himself. Herzog&#x27;s own thoughts and thought processes are laid bare in the letters he writes.

As the novel progresses, the letters become fewer and fewer. This seems to mirror the healing of the narrator&#x27;s mind, as his attention turns from his inner struggles and the intellectual ideas that fascinate him towards the real world outside and the real options offered by his current situation – not having to be a scholar, the possibility of starting afresh with Ramona, and so on.

==Autobiographical elements==
In many ways, the character of Herzog echoes that of a fictionalized Saul Bellow. Both Herzog and Bellow grew up in Canada, the sons of bootleggers who had emigrated from Russia (St. Petersburg). Both are Jewish, lived in Chicago for significant periods of time, and were divorced twice (ultimately, Bellow would marry five times, divorcing four of his wives). Herzog is nearly the same age that Bellow was when he wrote the novel. The character of Valentine Gersbach is based on Jack Ludwig, a long-time friend of Bellow who had an affair with Bellow&#x27;s second wife, Sondra. Similarly, Ramona is based on Rosette Lamont, a professor of French whom Bellow dated after divorcing Sondra. Both Lamont and Ludwig reviewed &quot;Herzog&quot; without mentioning the autobiographical elements, with the latter favorably describing it as &quot;a major breakthrough.&quot;

Asked about these similarities, Bellow said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that that sort of thing is really relevant. I mean, it&#x27;s a curiosity about reality, which is &quot;impure;&quot; let&#x27;s put it that way. Let&#x27;s both be bigger than that.&quot;

<text>Freightliner Trucks is an American semi truck manufacturer. Founded in 1929 as the truck-manufacturing division of Consolidated Freightways (from which it derives its name), the company was established in 1942 as Freightliner Corporation. Owned by Daimler Truck from 1981 to 2021, Freightliner is now a part of Daimler Truck subsidiary Daimler Truck North America (along with Western Star, Detroit Diesel, and Thomas Built Buses).

Freightliner produces a range of vans, medium-duty trucks, and heavy-duty trucks; under its Freightliner Custom Chassis subsidiary, the company produces bare chassis and cutaway chassis for multiple types of vehicles. The company popularized the use of cabover (COE) semitractors, with the Freightliner Argosy later becoming the final example of the type sold in North America.

The company is headquartered in Portland, Oregon (the city of its founding); vehicles are currently manufactured in Cleveland, North Carolina, and Mount Holly, North Carolina, and Santiago Tianguistenco and Saltillo, Mexico.

==History ==
===Founding (1930s)===

Freightliner traces its roots to 1929; following the founding of Consolidated Freightways (CF) in Portland, Oregon, company founder Leland James set up a company division to produce semitractors for company use. Developed in a CF maintenance facility, Freightways Manufacturing used Fageol vehicles as a starting point for the design, placing the cab above the front axle. Shorter in length, the new Freightways truck allowed for CF to use a longer trailer and remain in compliance of the stringent length laws of the time.

In line with the company name, during the 1930s, Freightways Manufacturing began to brand its truck production under the &quot;Freightliner&quot; name. In addition to their shorter length, the trucks underwent weight reduction using aluminum instead of steel to maximize use of engine power (needed to climb mountain grades in the western United States).

=== 1940s–1950s ===
In 1942, Leland James renamed Freightways Manufacturing as Freightliner Corporation; as part of the launch, the company debuts the first truck with an all-aluminum cab. Shifting to military production during World War II, Freightliner resumed truck production in 1947. In 1949, Freightliner sold its first vehicle outside of CF (to Portland-based forklift manufacturer Hyster); the vehicle is preserved in the Smithsonian collection in Washington, D.C.

As it largely existed as a subsidiary of a trucking company, Freightliner sought to establish a distribution network for its product line, allowing for higher production volumes and reduced costs. In 1951, Freightliner entered into an agreement with White Motor Company of Cleveland, Ohio. One of the largest truck manufacturers in the United States at the time, White sold Freightliner COEs under the &quot;White Freightliner&quot; co-branding (all vehicles produced for CF were Freightliners).

In 1953, Freightliner introduced a cab with an overhead-mounted sleeper (further shortening the cab). The first-generation &quot;shovelnose&quot; cab was retired for 1954 in favor of the taller, flatter &quot;WFT&quot; design; as an option, a &quot;Mountaineer&quot; 4x4 system was offered.

For 1958, the cab design was updated to tilt forward 90 degrees, increasing access to the engine.

===1960s===
To reduce import tariffs imposed by Canada (later removed by Auto Pact), Freightliner opened its first Canadian manufacturing facility in 1961, in Burnaby, British Columbia. To increase production in the United States, assembly plants were opened in Chino, California, and Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1969, a second facility was opened in Portland for parts production.

===1970s===

White Motor Company became troubled in the 1970s. Expansion into appliances and agricultural equipment consumed capital without producing a return, and the relationship with Consolidated Freightways became frayed. In 1974, the distribution agreement was terminated, and Freightliner Corp. began life as a freestanding manufacturer and distributor. Many of the first dealers were from the White Motor Co. network, but some entrepreneurs also signed up to represent the trucks without the White Motor Co. franchise as a complement.

At the same time, the company introduced its first conventional model, an adaptation of the high COE mainstay product. High COEs accounted for well over 50% of the US market in those days, owing to overall length regulations that limited the bumper-to-taillight dimension of a semitrailer unit to 55 ft on interstate highways. Conventionals were popular on western roads due to more convenient ingress/egress, better ride, and easier access to the engine for servicing.

In 1979, a new plant in Mount Holly, North Carolina, and a parts manufacturing plant in Gastonia, North Carolina, were constructed, both in the Charlotte metropolitan area. Volumes continued to increase.

The year 1979 marked a consequential event in the evolution of Freightliner, and of the whole trucking and truck manufacturing industries. President Carter signed bills into law deregulating transport both on the ground and in the skies. Deregulation changed the economics of trucking and removed the system of regulated carriage that protected carriers, instead allowing more competition.

===1980s===


Three years later, the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 relaxed weight and length standards and imposed a new excise tax on heavy trucks and the tires they use. No longer was the overall length of semitrailer combinations restricted; rather, only the trailer was specified, to be not greater than 53 ft in length. Individual states retained more restrictive overall length laws, but fundamentally, the rules had changed forever.

Consolidated Freightways, a traditional, unionized carrier that flourished in the era before deregulation, realized it was in a fight for its life. In May 1981, it sold its truck manufacturing business and the Freightliner brand to Daimler-Benz, allowing it to concentrate its management attention and financial resources on its traditional trucking business. Around this time, the Chino and Indianapolis plants were closed permanently. Consolidated Freightways continued carrier business until 2002, when it ceased operation on Labor Day weekend.

In 1985 Freightliner introduced a new Medium Conventional series (FLC112), using the passenger portion of the cabin from the then recently introduced Mercedes-Benz LK. Mercedes cabins gradually became used for a number of Freightliner trucks. In 1989, Freightliner acquired a standing plant in Cleveland, North Carolina, near Statesville, that had been producing transit buses for German manufacturer MAN.

===1990s===
In 1991, parent company Daimler-Benz withdrew from the medium-duty truck segment, shifting its presence to Freightliner. Serving as the replacement for the aging Mercedes-Benz L1117, the Business Class made its debut. Also called the FL series, the Business Class was a downsized version of the FLC112, sharing its cab with the Mercedes-Benz LKN cabover. Along with a lighter GVWR, the FL was given a shorter hood with two headlights. The first all-new entry in the medium-duty market in over a decade, the model line met with success.

Another pronounced downturn in the industry&#x27;s fortunes necessitated drastic measures to restore Freightliner to financial health, and Dieter Zetsche, now the chairman of Daimler-Benz&#x27;s Board of Management, was dispatched to lead the project as CEO. The Burnaby assembly plant was closed, replaced by a new facility in St. Thomas, Ontario. Cost reduction programs across the company restored profitability when the market rebounded. Significantly, production also commenced in Santiago Tianguistenco, Mexico, about outside Mexico City, in a plant owned by Daimler-Benz. At that time, the plant was also producing buses, Brazilian-designed medium-duty trucks, and compact Mercedes-Benz passenger cars.

Following the introduction of the medium-duty Business Class, Freightliner saw further evolution to its model range. For 1996, the company introduced the Freightliner Century Class, its first completely new Class 8 conventional in over 20 years. A year later, the company began production of cowled bus chassis, with the FS-65 derived from the medium-duty Business Class. For 1999 production, the Freightliner Argosy debuted; directly replacing the FLB, the Argosy consolidated four previous Freightliner COEs into a single model range. The first clean-sheet COE design from Freightliner since the Daimler acquisition, the Argosy largely eliminated the engine intrusion into the cab, sharing many body components and electronics with the Century Class conventional. In 1997, Freightliner acquired the truck-producing division of the Ford Motor Company and rebranded it as Sterling.

In 1999, Freightliner built its one-millionth vehicle. The Century Class conventional model family was expanded, adding the Columbia conventional. While sharing the same cab structure, the Columbia is developed primarily for fleet applications (though both model lines become popular with owner-operators).

==== Company diversification ====
The 1990s were a busy era for truck manufacturers in general, and for Freightliner in particular, under the leadership of flamboyant James L. Hebe, a former Kenworth sales executive who joined the company in 1989. During the decade, Freightliner made numerous acquisitions to further diversify itself:

1995 – Oshkosh Custom Chassis in Gaffney, South Carolina, became Freightliner Custom Chassis, producing the underpinnings for walk-in vans used by companies such as UPS to deliver parcels and Cintas for uniform laundry services; diesel recreational vehicles; conventional school buses; and shuttle buses. The Oshkosh and Freightliner partnership has dissolved, and Oshkosh is no longer affiliated with Freightliner.

1996 – American LaFrance was purchased; a 130-year-old manufacturer of fire apparatus, it was Mr. Hebe&#x27;s first employer. American LaFrance had fallen on hard times and was moribund at the time of the acquisition. At the end of the year, Freightliner acquired the rights of the heavy-truck product lines of Ford Motor Company.

1997 – As a result of the Ford heavy-truck acquisition, Freightliner created Sterling Trucks (using a long-dormant nameplate once owned by White Motor Company). Intended primarily as vocational trucks, the Sterling product line consisted of rebranded versions of the Ford Louisville/AeroMax and Ford Cargo.

1998 – Freightliner acquires bus manufacturer Thomas Built Buses, based in High Point, North Carolina. Sterling-brand trucks entered production in St. Thomas, Ontario (sold concurrently with the final Ford heavy trucks).

=== 2000s ===

At the beginning of the 21st century, Freightliner was part of DaimlerChrysler, following the 1998 merger of its parent company with Chrysler; several changes in 2000 were made by the merged company that affected Freightliner. Canadian-based Western Star Trucks, a premium truck manufacturer was acquired in its entirety, giving Freightliner a third truck brand (along with assembly plants in Kelowna, British Columbia, and Ladson, South Carolina). Originally an entity of General Motors, DaimlerChrysler acquired Detroit Diesel, integrating its operations within Freightliner.

Coinciding with the fragile economy, Freightliner was awash in used trucks it could not sell; following the rapid expansion of the previous decade, Freightliner was left with multiple poor-performing operations outside of its core truck brand which was in decline in a poor economy. Seeking new leadership, DaimlerChrysler installed former company CFO to begin a turnaround for Freightliner. By 2002, the Kelowna Western Star plant was closed (shifting to Portland), along with a Thomas facility in Woodstock, Ontario (consolidating entirely to High Point).

For 2002, the Freightliner product line underwent multiple updates. For the medium-duty segment, Freightliner introduced a second generation of the Business Class, the Business Class M2, ranging from Class 5 to Class 8 severe-service conventionals. In place of the cab derived from Mercedes-Benz, the M2 was designed entirely by Freightliner. The Century Class model family was expanded further, debuting the Freightliner Coronado premium conventional. Styled similar to the FLD132 Classic XL, the Coronado shared its cab structure and technology with the Century Class and Columbia, marketed towards owner-operators. In a further expansion of the vocational model line, the Freightliner Condor was introduced as the first low-entry COE; competing with the Autocar Xpeditor, the Condor was developed nearly entirely for refuse applications.

In the early 2000s, the operations of Freightliner subsidiaries would undergo multiple changes. Following the acquisition of Western Star Trucks, Freightliner consolidated production of American LaFrance in the previous Western Star plant in Ladson, South Carolina; the attempt to integrate production of specialized emergency vehicles into a company noted for high volume production capabilities proved unworkable.
While remaining the fifth-largest manufacturer in the emergency vehicle segment, American LaFrance was sold in 2005 to private equity fund, with DaimlerChrysler retaining ownership of the Ladson factory.

For 2006, the Sprinter van underwent a redesign (for the first time); final assembly shifts to the former American LaFrance facility in Ladson, South Carolina. While sold nearly exclusively as a cargo van, the Freightliner Sprinter is also offered as a passenger vehicle (alongside Dodge and Mercedes-Benz Sprinters).

After 2006 production, Freightliner ended sales of the Argosy cabover in North America. The first company to produce a fully tilting cab, Freightliner was the final truck manufacturer in North America to offer a Class 8 cabover. The Argosy remains in production in North America, sold exclusively for export.

In the summer of 2007, DaimlerChrysler was split, with the Freightliner parent company reorganizing itself as Daimler AG. Freightliner begins production of trucks in Saltillo, Mexico. On January 7, 2008, Freightliner LLC was renamed Daimler Trucks North America, LLC (DTNA), operating as the parent company of the Freightliner Trucks brand, alongside Sterling, Western Star, Detroit Diesel, and Thomas Built Buses.

For 2008, the company introduced Freightliner Cascadia, a new-generation Class 8 conventional. Intended as the successor to the Century Class and Columbia, the Cascadia consolidated the two model lines; while styled as a scaled-up M2, the Cascadia was optimized for fuel economy, safety, and reliability. Within the vocational model line, the Condor low-entry COE was discontinued.

In 2009, Freightliner began production of natural gas versions of the Business Class M2 in its Mount Holly facility. In March 2009, DTNA discontinued Sterling Trucks, citing substantial model overlap with Freightliner and decreasing market share (in spite of multiple product launches). The closure of Sterling also brought a closure of the St. Thomas plant.
=== 2010s ===

Following the closure of Sterling, the Freightliner model line underwent a transition. While the M2 remained unchanged, the FLD 120/132 Classic/Classic XL were discontinued for 2010; after the model year, the Columbia and Century Class were also discontinued (in North America). In line with the Argosy, production of the Century Class shifted entirely to export. The Coronado long-hood conventional was joined by the Coronado SD (developed primarily for vocational applications).

In 2010, Freightliner introduced its first diesel-electric hybrid vehicle, based on a M2 106.For 2011, the company debuted the SD model family. Alongside the Coronado SD introduced the previous year, two new models were added, the 108SD and 114SD, derived from the M2 model family.

In 2012, Freightliner celebrated its 70th anniversary, unveiling the Revolution concept vehicle. Constructed of carbon fiber and plastic, the cab featured a redesigned layout. Intended for use by a single driver, the passenger seat was replaced by a jumpseat (converting into a sleeper bed); to optimize trailer hookups, the design included a rear access door. As a result of increased demand for the Cascadia, parent company DTNA announced plans in 2012 to expand its workforce at its Cleveland, NC, facility. Alongside the Cascadia, nearly 20% of trucks produced by the plant (including the Argosy and Century Class) were exported to South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.In 2013, Freightliner expanded its alternative-fuel lineup, adding a natural-gas version of the Cascadia. Introduced as a premium option for the Cascadia, the Cascadia Evolution further enhanced aerodynamics and fuel economy (distinguished by its full rear wheel covers) and improved interior features. The Coronado was added to SD model family, renamed the 122SD.

On August 22, 2014, the Cleveland plant built the 3 millionth vehicle of Daimler Truck North America, a 2015 Cascadia Evolution. At the time, Freightliner employed 2600 workers at the facility and 8000 employees in North Carolina.

In May 2015, the Freightliner Inspiration was unveiled near Hoover Dam. The first road-licensed autonomous semitruck, the Inspiration was loosely based on a Cascadia. A Level 3 autonomous vehicle, the autonomous driving system was equated to the autopilot system of an airliner or a Tesla (requiring operator presence).

For 2017 production, Freightliner introduced a second-generation Cascadia, adopting elements of the design from the Inspiration autonomous vehicle.

For 2018, Freightliner debuted the EconicSD low-entry COE. Intended largely for refuse applications, the model line is an adaptation of the Mercedes-Benz Econic.

In September 2019, parent company Daimler announced that it would be halting &quot;its internal combustion engine development initiatives as part of its efforts to embrace electric vehicles.&quot;

=== 2020s ===
As of May 2022, the MT-series step van (called MT50e) is available as an all-electric vehicle, and so are school buses built on Freightliner&#x27;s chassis. Also, the eCascadia, an all-electric semi-truck by Freightliner, was handed to customers for field tests in 2019, then officially premiered in May 2022. An all-electric variant of the M2 box truck has undergone field tests. In 2022, Freightliner revealed an update for the M2 Business Class series.

==Models==
Models of Freightliner trucks over the decades have included:


== Legal controversy ==
As of December 2020, Freightliner is under a court order to improve safety, and was fined $30 million by the NHTSA after an investigation found that Freightliner had failed to recall dozens of known safety defects in its vehicles. In 2019 alone, Freightliner was forced to issue safety recalls 24 separate times by the NHTSA, and there have been over 100 recalls total on its flagship truck, the Cascadia. The judge found that Freightliner had no system in place to track faults, and ordered $5 million of the fine be applied to upgrading outdated paper-based systems and converting to recall software used by other automakers for decades.

As of May 2021, the 2019 Freightliner Cascadia has three open investigations against it for different issues.

<text>Starting at the end of the nineteenth century, well before the advent of electronic computers, data processing was performed using electromechanical machines collectively referred to as unit record equipment, electric accounting machines (EAM) or [[tabulating machine]]s.
Unit record machines came to be as ubiquitous in industry and government in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century as computers became in the last third. They allowed large volume, sophisticated data-processing tasks to be accomplished before electronic computers were invented and while they were still in their infancy. This data processing was accomplished by processing punched cards through various unit record machines in a carefully choreographed progression. This progression, or flow, from machine to machine was often planned and documented with detailed flowcharts that used standardized symbols for documents and the various machine functions. All but the earliest machines had high-speed mechanical feeders to process cards at rates from around 100 to 2,000 per minute, sensing punched holes with mechanical, electrical, or, later, optical sensors. The operation of many machines was directed by the use of a removable plugboard, control panel, or connection box. Initially all machines were manual or electromechanical. The first use of an electronic component was in 1937 when a photocell was used in a Social Security bill-feed machine. Electronic components were used on other machines beginning in the late 1940s.

The term &quot;unit record equipment&quot; also refers to peripheral equipment attached to computers that reads or writes unit records, e.g., card readers, card punches, printers, MICR readers.

IBM was the largest supplier of unit record equipment and this article largely reflects IBM practice and terminology.

==History==

===Beginnings===
In the 1880s Herman Hollerith was the first to record data on a medium that could then be read by a machine. Prior uses of machine readable media had been for lists of instructions (not data) to drive programmed machines such as Jacquard looms and mechanized musical instruments. &quot;After some initial trials with paper tape, he settled on punched cards [...]&quot;. To process these punched cards, sometimes referred to as &quot;Hollerith cards&quot;, he invented the keypunch, sorter, and tabulator unit record machines. These inventions were the foundation of the data processing industry. The tabulator used electromechanical relays to increment mechanical counters. Hollerith&#x27;s method was used in the 1890 census. The company he founded in 1896, the Tabulating Machine Company (TMC), was one of four companies that in 1911 were amalgamated in the forming of a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, later renamed IBM.

Following the 1900 census a permanent Census bureau was formed. The bureau&#x27;s contract disputes with Hollerith led to the formation of the Census Machine Shop where James Powers and others developed new machines for part of the 1910 census processing. Powers left the Census Bureau in 1911, with rights to patents for the machines he developed, and formed the Powers Accounting Machine Company. In 1927 Powers&#x27; company was acquired by Remington Rand. In 1919 Fredrik Rosing Bull, after examining Hollerith&#x27;s machines, began developing unit record machines for his employer. Bull&#x27;s patents were sold in 1931, constituting the basis for Groupe Bull.

These companies, and others, manufactured and marketed a variety of general-purpose unit record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating punched cards, even after the development of computers in the 1950s. Punched card technology had quickly developed into a powerful tool for business data-processing.

* 1929 The Accounting and Tabulating Machine Company of Great Britain Limited renamed Powers-Samas Accounting Machine Limited (Samas, full name Societe Anonyme des Machines a Statistiques, had been the Power&#x27;s sales agency in France, formed in 1922). The informal reference &quot;Acc and Tab&quot; would persist.
* 1930: The Remington Rand 90 column card, offering &quot;more storage capacity [and] alphabetic capability&quot;
* 1931: H.W.Egli - BULL founded to capitalize on the punched card technology patents of Fredrik Rosing Bull. The Tabulator model T30 is introduced. 

* 1931: The Tabulating Machine Company&#x27;s first punched card machine that could multiply, the &quot;600 Multiplying Punch&quot;. Their first alphabetical accounting machine - although not a complete alphabet, the Alphabetic Tabulator Model B was quickly followed by the full alphabet ATC.
* 1931: The term &quot;Super Computing Machine&quot; is used by the New York World newspaper to describe the &quot;Columbia Difference Tabulator&quot;, a one-of-a-kind special purpose tabulator-based machine made for the Columbia Statistical Bureau, a machine so massive it was nicknamed &quot;Packard&quot;. The &quot;Packard&quot; attracted users from across the country: &quot;the Carnegie Foundation, Yale, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Ohio State, Harvard, California and Princeton.&quot;
* 1933: Compagnie des Machines Bull is the new name of the reorganized H.W. Egli - Bull.

* 1937: Leslie Comrie establishes the Scientific Computing Service Limited - the first for-profit calculating agency.
* 1937: The first collator, the IBM 077 Collator The first use of an electronic component in an IBM product was a photocell in a Social Security bill-feed machine. By 1937 IBM had 32 presses at work in Endicott, N.Y., printing, cutting and stacking five to 10 million punched cards every day.
* 1938: Powers-Samas multiplying punch introduced.
* 1941 Introduction of Bull Type A unit record machines based on 80 column card.

* 1946: The first IBM punched card machine that could divide, the IBM 602, was introduced. Unreliable, it &quot;was upgraded to the 602-A (a &#x27;602 that worked&#x27;) [...] by 1948&quot;. The IBM 603 Electronic Multiplier was introduced, &quot;the first electronic calculator ever placed into production.&quot;.
* 1948: The IBM 604 Electronic Punch. &quot;No other calculator of comparable size or cost could match its capability&quot;.
* 1949: The IBM 024 Card Punch, 026 Printing Card Punch, 082 Sorter, 403 Accounting machine, 407 Accounting machine, and Card Programmed Calculator (CPC) introduced.
* 1952: Bull Gamma 3 introduced. An electronic calculator with delay-line memory, programmed by a connection panel, that was connected to a tabulator or card reader-punch. The Gamma 3 had greater capacity, greater speed, and lower rentals than competitive products.
* 1952: Remington Rand 409 Calculator (aka. UNIVAC 60, UNIVC 120) introduced.
* 1952: Underwood Corp acquires the American assets of Powers-Samas.
By the 1950s punched cards and unit record machines had become ubiquitous in academia, industry and government. The warning often printed on cards that were to be individually handled, &quot;Do not fold, spindle or mutilate&quot;, coined by Charles A. Philips, became a motto for the post-World War II era (even though many people had no idea what spindle meant).

With the development of computers punched cards found new uses as their principal input media. Punched cards were used not only for data, but for a new application - computer programs, see: Computer programming in the punched card era. Unit record machines therefore remained in computer installations in a supporting role for keypunching, reproducing card decks, and printing.

* 1955: IBM produces 72.5 million punched cards per day.
* 1957: The IBM 608, a transistor version of the 1948 IBM 604. First commercial all-transistor calculator.
* 1958: The &quot;Series 50&quot;, basic accounting machines, was announced. These were modified machines, with reduced speed and/or function, offered for rental at reduced rates. The name &quot;Series 50&quot; relates to a similar marketing effort, the &quot;Model 50&quot;, seen in the IBM 1940 product booklet. An alternate report identifies the modified machines as &quot;Type 5050&quot; introduced in 1959 and notes that Remington-Rand introduced similar products.
* 1959: BTM is merged with rival Powers-Samas to form International Computers and Tabulators(ICT).
* 1959: The IBM 1401, internally known in IBM for a time as &quot;SPACE&quot; for &quot;Stored Program Accounting and Calculating Equipment&quot; and developed in part as a response to the Bull Gamma 3, outperforms three IBM 407s and a 604, while having a much lower rental. That functionality combined with the availability of tape drives, accelerated the decline in unit record equipment usage.
* 1960: The IBM 609 Calculator, an improved 608 with core memory. This will be IBMs last punched card calculator.

Many organizations were loath to alter systems that were working, so production unit record installations remained in operation long after computers offered faster and more cost effective solutions. Cost or availability of equipment was another factor; for example in 1965 an IBM 1620 computer did not have a printer as standard equipment, so it was normal in such installations to punch output onto cards and then print these cards on an IBM 407 accounting machine. Specialized uses of punched cards such as toll collection, microform aperture cards, and punched card voting kept unit record equipment in use into the twenty-first century.

* 1968: International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) is merged with English Electric Computers, forming International Computers Limited (ICL).
* 1969: The IBM System/3, renting for less than $1,000 a month, the ancestor of IBM&#x27;s midrange computer product line, aka. minicomputers, was aimed at new customers and organizations that still used IBM 1400 series computers or unit record equipment. It featured a new, smaller, punched card with a 96 column format. Instead of the rectangular punches in the classic IBM card, the new cards had tiny (1 mm), circular holes much like paper tape. By July 1974 more than 25,000 System/3s had been installed.
* 1971: The IBM 129 Card Data Recorder (keypunch and auxiliary on-line card reader/punch) is the last, or among the last, 80-column card unit record product announcements (other than card readers and card punches attached to computers).
* 1975 Cardamation founded, a U.S. company that supplied punched card equipment and supplies until 2011.

===Endings=== 

* 1976: The IBM 407 Accounting Machine was withdrawn from marketing.
* 1978: IBM&#x27;s Rochester plant made its last shipment of the IBM 082, 084, 085, 087, 514, and 548 machines. The System/3 was succeeded by the System/38.
* 1980: The last reconditioning of an IBM 519 Document Originating Punch.
* 1984: The IBM 029 Card Punch, announced in 1964, was withdrawn from marketing. IBM closed its last punch card manufacturing plant.
* 2010: A group from the Computer History Museum reported that an IBM 402 Accounting Machine and related punched card equipment was still in operation at a filter manufacturing company in Conroe, Texas. The punched card system was still in use as of 2013.
*2011: The owner of Cardamation, Robert G. Swartz, dies, and the company, perhaps the last supplier of punch card equipment, ceases operation.
*2015: Punched cards for time clocks and some other applications were still available; one supplier was the California Tab Card Company. As of 2018, the web site was no longer in service.

==Punched cards==


The basic unit of data storage was the punched card. The IBM 80-column card was introduced in 1928. The Remington Rand Card with 45 columns in each of two tiers, thus 90 columns, in 1930. Powers-Samas punched cards include one with 130 columns. Columns on different punch cards vary from 5 to 12 punch positions.
The method used to store data on punched cards is vendor specific. In general each column represents a single digit, letter or special character. Sequential card columns allocated for a specific use, such as names, addresses, multi-digit numbers, etc., are known as a field. An employee number might occupy 5 columns; hourly pay rate, 3 columns; hours worked in a given week, 2 columns; department number 3 columns; project charge code 6 columns and so on.

==Keypunching==


Original data were usually punched into cards by workers, often women, known as keypunch operators, under the control of a program card (called a &quot;drum card&quot; because it was installed on a rotating drum in the machine), which could automatically skip or duplicate predefined card columns, enforce numeric-only entry, and, later, right-justify a number entered.

Their work was often checked by a second operator using a verifier machine, also under the control of a drum card. The verifier operator re-keyed the source data and the machine compared what was keyed to what had been punched on the original card.
==Sorting==

An activity in many unit record shops was sorting card decks into the order necessary for the next processing step. Sorters, like the IBM 80 series Card Sorters, sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter&#x27;s settings. The 13th pocket was for blanks and rejects. Cards were sorted on one card column at a time; sorting on, for example, a five digit zip code required that the card deck be processed five times. Sorting an input card deck into ascending sequence on a multiple column field, such as an employee number, was done by a radix sort, bucket sort, or a combination of the two methods.

Sorters were also used to separate decks of interspersed master and detail cards, either by a significant hole punch or by the cards corner-cut.

More advanced functionality was available in the IBM 101 Electronic Statistical Machine, which could
* Sort
* Count
* Accumulate totals
* Print summaries
* Send calculated results (counts and totals) to an attached IBM 524 &quot;Duplicating Summary Punch&quot;.

==Tabulating==
Reports and summary data were generated by accounting or tabulating machines. The original tabulators only counted the presence of a hole at a location on a card. Simple logic, like ands and ors could be done using relays.

Later tabulators, such as those in IBM&#x27;s 300 series, directed by a control panel, could do both addition and subtraction of selected fields to one or more counters and print each card on its own line. At some signal, say a following card with a different customer number, totals could be printed for the just completed customer number. Tabulators became complex: the IBM 405 contained &quot;55,000 parts (2,400 different) and 75 miles of wire&quot;; a Remington Rand machine circa 1941 contained 40,000 parts. 
==Calculating==
In 1931, IBM introduced the model 600 multiplying punch. The ability to divide became commercially available after World War II. The earliest of these &quot;calculating punches&quot; were electromechanical. Later models employed vacuum tube logic. Electronic modules developed for these units were used in early computers, such as the IBM 650. The Bull Gamma 3 calculator could be attached to tabulating machines, unlike the stand-alone IBM calculators.
==Card punching==

Card punching operations included:
*Gang punching - producing a large number of identically punched cards—for example, for inventory tickets.
*Reproducing - reproducing a card deck in its entirety or just selected fields. A payroll master card deck might be reproduced at the end of a pay period with the hours worked and net pay fields blank and ready for the next pay period&#x27;s data. Programs in the form of card decks were reproduced for backup.
*Summary punching - punching new cards with details and totals from an attached tabulating machine.
*Mark sense reading - detecting electrographic lead pencil marks on ovals printed on the card and punching the corresponding data values into the card.

Singularly or in combination, these operations were provided in a variety of machines. The IBM 519 Document-Originating Machine could perform all of the above operations.

The IBM 549 Ticket Converter read data from Kimball tags, copying that data to punched cards.
With the development of computers, punched cards were also produced by computer output devices.

== Collating==
IBM collators had two input hoppers and four output pockets. These machines could merge or match card decks based on the control panel&#x27;s wiring as illustrated here.

The Remington Rand Interfiling Reproducing Punch Type 310-1 was designed to merge two separate files into a single file. It could also punch additional information into those cards and select desired cards.

Collators performed operations comparable to a database join.

== Interpreting==
An interpreter prints characters on a punched card equivalent to the values of all or selected columns. The columns to be printed can be selected and even reordered, based on the machine&#x27;s control panel wiring. Later models could print on one of several rows on the card. Unlike keypunches, which print values directly above each column, interpreters generally use a font that was a little wider than a column and can only print up to 60 characters per row. Typical models include the IBM 550 Numeric Interpreter, the IBM 557 Alphabetic Interpreter, and the Remington Rand Type 312 Alphabetic Interpreter.

==Filing==
Batches of punched cards were often stored in tub files, where individual cards could be pulled to meet the requirements of a particular application.

==Transmission of punched card data==
Electrical transmission of punched card data was invented in the early 1930s. The device was called an Electrical Remote Control of Office Machines and was assigned to IBM.
Inventors were Joseph C. Bolt of Boston &amp; Curt I. Johnson; Worcester, Mass. assors to the Tabulating Machine Co., Endicott, NY. The Distance Control Device received a US patent in Aug.9,1932: . Letters from IBM talk about filling in Canada in 9/15/1931.

==Processing punched tape==
The IBM 046 Tape-to-Card Punch and the IBM 047 Tape-to-Card Printing Punch (which was almost identical, but with the addition of a printing mechanism) read data from punched paper tape and punched that data into cards. The IBM 063 Card-Controlled Tape Punch read punched cards, punching that data into paper tape.

==Control panel wiring and Connection boxes==

The operation of Hollerith/BTM/IBM/Bull tabulators and many other types of unit record equipment was directed by a control panel. Operation of Powers-Samas/Remington Rand unit record equipment was directed by a connection box.

Control panels had a rectangular array of holes called hubs which were organized into groups. Wires with metal ferrules at each end were placed in the hubs to make connections. The output from some card column positions might connected to a tabulating machine&#x27;s counter, for example. A shop would typically have separate control panels for each task a machine was used for.

==Paper handling equipment==
For many applications, the volume of fan-fold paper produced by tabulators required other machines, not considered to be unit record machines, to ease paper handling.

* A decollator separated multi-part fan-fold paper into individual stacks of one-part fan-fold and removed the carbon paper.
* A burster separated one-part fan-fold paper into individual sheets. For some uses it was desirable to remove the tractor-feed holes on either side of the fan-fold paper. In these cases the form&#x27;s edge strips were perforated and the burster removed them as well.

<text>Kenworth Truck Company is an American truck manufacturer. Founded in 1923 as the successor to Gersix Motor Company, Kenworth specializes in production of heavy-duty (Class 8) and medium-duty (Class 5–7) commercial vehicles. Headquartered in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, Washington, Kenworth has been a wholly owned subsidiary of PACCAR since 1945, operating alongside sister company (and marketplace rival) Peterbilt Motors.

Kenworth marked several firsts in truck production; the company introduced a raised-roof sleeper cab, and the first heavy-duty truck with an aerodynamically optimized body design. The Kenworth W900 has been produced continuously since 1961, serving as one of the longest production runs of any vehicle in automotive history. The K100 was also released in 1961.

==History==

=== 1912-1923: Gerlinger Motors ===
Kenworth traces its roots to the 1912 founding of Gerlinger Motors in Portland, Oregon; the company was a car and truck dealership owned by brothers George T. Gerlinger and Louis Gerlinger, Jr. In 1914, the brothers expanded into vehicle manufacturing, marketing a truck named the Gersix. Deriving its name from its inline six-cylinder engine (one of the first trucks equipped with the type), the Gersix was framed in structural steel, intended for commercial use.

While the first vehicle was completed largely as a side project, the heavy-duty construction of the Gersix found itself in demand by loggers in the Northwest. In 1916, Gerlinger Motors relocated from Portland to Tacoma, Washington, leasing a building from Seattle businessman Edgar K. Worthington.

In 1917, Gerlinger Motors filed for bankruptcy and was put up for sale, with E.K. Worthington acquiring the company with business partner Captain Frederick Kent. To emphasize its connection to truck manufacturing, the company was renamed Gersix Motor Company. In 1919, Captain Kent retired, with his son Harry Kent replacing him as partner in the company.

In 1922, Gersix produced 53 trucks in its final year located at its factory on Fairview Avenue at Valley Street. Following continued strong demand of the model line, the company found itself with $60,000 to reincorporate and relocate its headquarters.

=== 1923-1930s: Kenworth Motor Truck Company ===
In January 1923, Gersix Motor Company was reincorporated as the Kenworth Motor Truck Company, combining the names of partners Kent and Worthington. Under the new name, the company relocated within Seattle to 506 Mercer Street, and later to 1263 Mercer Street. In contrast to car manufacturers, Kenworth abstained from assembly lines, instead constructing vehicles in individual bays. The company also introduced a practice of building vehicles to customer specification (a practice still offered by Kenworth today).

In 1926, Kenworth expanded its product line, introducing its first bus. In 1927, production was increased from two vehicles a week to three; the same year, manufacturing began in Canada (to avoid import taxes).

In 1929, E.K. Worthington retired, with Harry Kent becoming company president. In another change, to accommodate increased demand, Kenworth relocated to a larger factory within Seattle.

The onset of the Great Depression hit the company hard; initially in good financial health, a substantial decline in new vehicles and a high rate of vehicle loan defaults forced the company to adapt. In 1932, Kenworth produced its first fire truck; adapted from its commercial truck, Kenworth fire engines were among the heaviest-duty fire apparatus of the time.

In 1933, diesel engines became standard equipment, replacing gasoline engines entirely; at the time, diesel fuel cost the price of gasoline. In another design innovation, Kenworth introduced the first factory-produced sleeper cab.

In 1935, the Motor Carrier Act was passed, introducing new size and weight regulations for the trucking industry in the United States; to comply with the legislation, Kenworth underwent an extensive redesign of its truck line. To match weight regulations, the new trucks received aluminum cabs and axle hubs; four-spring suspension was introduced, with torsion bars for the rear axles. In 1936, Kenworth introduced the Model 516, its first cabover (COE) truck; the tandem-axle 346 was introduced for 1937. In 1937, Harry Kent died, with Philip Johnson becoming company president.

=== 1940s: War production and company sale ===
In 1939, Kenworth introduced its 500-series trucks, which would form the basis of its commercial truck line into the mid-1950s. By the end of the 1930s, demand for trucks began to recover, with Kenworth producing 226 trucks in 1940.

Following the onset of World War II, Kenworth converted to war production, supplying the Army with 4-ton 6x6 M-1 recovery vehicles. In 1943, the company became a supplier for Boeing, manufacturing components for the B–17 and B– 29 bombers. To maintain its government contracts, Kenworth commenced production of the M-1 wrecker at a temporary facility in Yakima, Washington. In total, the company would supply the Army with 1,930 wreckers by the end of World War II; to accommodate the extensive increase in production, Kenworth introduced an assembly line to produce the vehicle.

In 1944, company president Phil Johnson died, leaving ownership split between his wife, Harry Kent’s widow, and another company director. Uninterested in owning the company, all three initially planned to offer their ownership to company employees, but financing for the offer was never completed. In 1945, Pacific Car and Foundry Company purchased Kenworth as a wholly owned subsidiary. By the end of 1946, Kenworth relocated again in Seattle, following the purchase of a former Fisher Body factory by Pacific Car and Foundry; this would house all Kenworth manufacturing under a single roof.

In 1948, Kenworth redesigned the cab of its COE product line, later nicknamed the &quot;Bull-nose&quot; 500-series.

=== 1950s: Market expansion ===
By 1950, Kenworth had grown outside the Pacific Northwest, marketing vehicles across the western half of the United States and across nearly 30 countries worldwide. In 1951, the company received an order for 1,700 Model 853s from ARAMCO in the Middle East. The Model 801 was introduced as an earth-moving dump truck, adopting one of the first cab-beside-engine configurations.

In 1955, Kenworth began the redesign of its COE product line, launching the CSE (Cab-Surrounding-Engine); in line with the Bull-nose, the CSE shared its underpinnings with the 500-series trucks and did not have a tilting cab.

In 1956, Pacific Car and Foundry revised its ownership of Kenworth, changing it from an independent subsidiary to a division. The same year, the 900-series was introduced with an all-new &quot;drop-frame&quot; chassis, with the CSE cabover replaced by the K-series COE (derived from the 900 series). In 1957, Kenworth ended bus production, selling the rights to its product line (see below).

In 1958, Kenworth became a sister company to Peterbilt, as the latter company was acquired by Pacific Car and Foundry. In 1959, the company further expanded its sales base, establishing facilities in Mexico.

=== 1960s: W900 and K100 ===
For 1961 production, Kenworth underwent a substantial revision of its commercial truck line, debuting the W900 and the K900 (later renamed the K100); the W and K model prefixes are derived from company founders Worthington and Kent. The W900 debuted the first complete redesign of the Kenworth conventional cab since 1939 with a standard tilting hood. Similar in appearance to the previous K500, the K900/K100 received a taller cab and the doors of the W900.

To meet increased demand for the new product lines, Kenworth opened a new assembly facility in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1964. From 1964 to 1966, Kenworth nearly doubled its yearly truck sales. In 1968, the company established Kenworth Australia; in place of importation and conversion, right-hand drive trucks were produced and developed in Melbourne, Australia. In 1969 Kenworth hired Gary Ridgway, who worked in their paint department for the next 32 years, during which time he murdered 48 women as the &quot;Green River Killer&quot;

=== 1970s: Product line diversification ===
During the 1970s, the company underwent further expansion, adding an all-new facility in Chillicothe, Ohio, in 1974. The W900 and K100 underwent their most substantial revisions, becoming the W900A and K100C. Kenworth added two new product lines in 1972, adding the C500 6x6 severe-service conventional and the Hustler low-cab COE (developed jointly with Peterbilt and produced in Canada). The same year, parent company Pacific Car and Foundry adopted its current name PACCAR.

Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the company, annual Kenworth sales exceeded 10,000 for the first time for 1973.

For 1976, Kenworth launched a flagship customization series, the VIT (Very Important Trucker) with a high level of interior features; distinguished by its skylight windows, the Aerodyne sleeper cab was the first factory-produced sleeper cab with stand-up headroom (for both the W900 and K100). To commemorate the American Bicentennial, the VIT series was introduced in a limited-edition series of 50 (with each truck named after a state).

=== 1980s-1990s ===
In 1982 and 1984, respectively, the W900 and K100 underwent their most substantial revisions, becoming the W900B and K100E. While visually distinguished by the adoption of rectangular headlamps, the updates were centered around upgrading fuel economy, road handling, and reliability.

In 1985, the Kenworth T600 was released by the company; in contrast to the W900, the T600 was designed with a set-back front axle and a sloped hoodline. While the latter initially proved controversial, the combination improved aerodynamics, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. Intended as an expansion of the Kenworth model line, the success of the T600 would lead to the introductions of similar designs from multiple American truck manufacturers. In 1986, the T800 was introduced, adapting the sloped hoodline and set-back front axle for a heavy-duty chassis; the shorter-hood T400 was introduced in 1988 as a regional-haul tractor.

In 1987, Kenworth introduced the Mid-Ranger COE, its first medium-duty truck. Shared with Peterbilt, the Brazilian-produced Mid-Ranger was derived from the MAN G90 (a wide-body version of the Volkswagen LT). In 1992, the Mid-Ranger became the K300, as PACCAR shifted production to Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec.

In 1993, Kenworth opened its facility in Renton, Washington, as its third United States assembly plant.

In 1994, the T300 was introduced as the first Kenworth medium-duty conventional truck, adapting the T600 to a lower-GVWR Class 7 weight rating. The Aerocab sleeper was introduced, integrating the Aerodyne II sleeper cab and the drivers&#x27; cab as a single unit.

In 1996, Kenworth introduced the T2000 as its next-generation aerodynamic conventional. While not directly replacing the T600 and W900, the T2000 was a completely new design (the first from Kenworth since 1961). The first &quot;wide-body&quot; Kenworth conventional, the model shared its cab with Peterbilt, distinguished by its bumper-mounted headlamps. The T2000 was discontinued in 2010.

In 1998, parent company PACCAR purchased British truck manufacturer Leyland Trucks, two years after Dutch manufacturer DAF Trucks (the two had been merged as Leyland DAF from 1987 to 1993). Within PACCAR, DAF would develop COE trucks for Kenworth and Peterbilt.

=== 2000s-present: 21st-century trucks ===
In 2000, Kenworth redesigned its medium-duty COE range, with the K300 replacing the MAN-sourced design with a DAF 45 (Leyland Roadrunner) cab. Following declining demand for Class 8 cabovers, the K100E was quietly phased out after 2002 production in North America; Kenworth Australia continuing production of the model line.

In 2006, the company released the K500, the largest COE ever produced by the company. Developed primarily for off-highway applications, the K500 combined the chassis of the heavy-duty C500 and the COE cab of the DAF XF; all examples produced from 2006 to 2020 were sold for export.

In 2008, Kenworth underwent a modernization of its model line. The T600 underwent a substantial revision to its aerodynamics, becoming the T660. The medium-duty T300 was replaced by the Class 5-7 T170/T270/T370 model family. The low-cab COE made its return, based on the DAF LF. Initially marketed as the K260/K360, the model line was renamed the K270/K370 for 2013. The T660 would be discontinued in 2017.

For 2011 production, the T700 replaced the T2000, adopting a larger grille and fender-mounted headlamps. For 2013 production, the T680 was introduced as the third-generation aerodynamic Kenworth conventional, serving as a single replacement for the narrow-body T660 and the wide-body T700. The T700 was discontinued in 2014 while the T660 was discontinued in 2017 (32 years after the introduction of the T600). Sharing the same cab as the T680, the T880 was introduced as the first wide-body Kenworth for vocational applications, alongside the W900S and the T800 model family.

In 2018, the W990 was introduced as the flagship conventional of the Kenworth model line. Sharing the wide-body cab of the T680 and T880, the W990 is the longest-hood conventional ever produced by Kenworth. As of current production, the W900 remains part of the Kenworth model line (six decades after its introduction).

For 2021 production, Kenworth introduced three model lines of electric vehicles, with the K270E, K370E, and T680E powered by battery-electric powertrains. In 2021, Kenworth launched the T680 FCEV with a 10 vehicle demonstration fleet in California. The T680 FCEV is powered with a Toyota hydrogen fuel cell, has six hydrogen tanks and a driving range over at a full load weight of .

In 2022, Kenworth announced a new T680. The T680 Next-Gen was redesigned with the future in mind. The new Next-Gen model has a skinnier, but taller grill than the original T680. It has a completely all-new front bumper. Like the 579 Next-Gen (See Peterbilt), it has an all-new interior and steering wheel.

====Australia====

The headquarters for Kenworth Australia is located in Bayswater, Victoria where all Australian models are assembled. The first Kenworth model in Australia was the KWS925, imported fully built in 1962. Soon later, Kenworths were imported in complete knock-down kits and assembled in Preston, Victoria. Australian built Kenworth models are also exported to nearby RHD markets in New Zealand, Japan, Thailand and Papua New Guinea.

The T range includes the bonneted conventional models and the C for heavy haulage, mining, off-road and road train use, and the K range covers the cab over models. As of July 2020 the only models that do not have Twin-Steer configurations are T410 SAR, T610 SAR, T900, C510, C540.

Kenworth Australia started building the new range of trucks tying in their 2008 release with the model range being the &#x27;08 Series&#x27;. This includes the following conventional (bonneted) models; in approximate order of smallest to largest: the T358/A, T408SAR, T408, T608, T658, T908 and C508. The only cab over truck built was the K108, which was very popular in the B-Double market segment owing to its shorter length.

===== Legend Series =====
The Kenworth &quot;Legend&quot; Series is a limited production truck based on a previous models styling with modern improvements such as safety and environmental. Originally commencing in 2015 with the Kenworth T950 Legend, inspired by the Kenworth T950 that was in production from 1992 - 2007. This model of Kenworth Legend had 75 produced and sold out in 48 hours. The T950 Legend also came with a special edition Cummins ISXe5 engine which was painted in Cummins Heritage Beige.

2017 Saw the second truck in the Kenworth Legend Series released, that being the Kenworth T900 Legend inspired by the 1991 Kenworth T900. There were 257 Kenworth T900 Legends produced, The T900 Legend came with a special edition Cummins X15 painted in black and red to commemorate the Cummins N14 that many of the original T900 came with.

In 2021 the third truck in the Kenworth Legend Series was released this being the SAR Legend, a homage to the W900 SAR that was produced from 1975 until 1987. The SAR Legend has sales orders of over 700, a final number currently has not been released. The special edition Cummins X15 in the Kenworth SAR Legend is painted in Cummins Heritage Beige, similar to the Cummins Big Cam which were in many of the original Kenworth SARs.

====Mexico====

In the early 2000s Kenworth introduced to Mexico the T604, based on the Australian T604 with a few modifications, mostly in the hood.

== Operations ==
Kenworth currently has manufacturing plants in Chillicothe, Ohio; Renton, Washington, US; Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec, Canada; Bayswater, Victoria, Australia (Kenworth Australia); and Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico.

==Bus production==
Bus production was a mainstay at Kenworth during the early years of company history; at one time, buses were its most lucrative form of business. When the company was still known as Gerlinger Motor Car Works, their first two full-chassis vehicles were school buses based on the Gersix truck chassis.

===1920s===

====BU series====
In 1926, Kenworth developed a chassis specifically for school and transit bus operators, known as the BU. The BU model sported a wheelbase of that was expanded two more inches in 1927, and could be fitted with bodies ranging from 21 to 29 passengers. The BU model also heralded the return of the Buda six-cylinder engine, and remained the company&#x27;s principal offering through 1931. The new model became so popular in the Pacific Northwest that production rose from 99 units in 1927 and 127 units in 1927, to 230 units by 1930.

By that time, the predominant number of BU models produced were sent to school bus body builders and were built for use in school districts throughout the Seattle and Puget Sound area of Washington state.

=== 1930s ===

====KHC series====
Kenworth continued expanding into bus production throughout the 1930s, despite the Great Depression being a major influence. To assist Kenworth&#x27;s 80 factory workers - who were idled by the Depression, the company undertook a bold move by introducing a new line of buses in August 1932. Known as the KHC-22 (Kenworth - Heiser - City), the 23-passenger bus was developed by Kenworth engineers as a stock demo vehicle to help aid a glum sales picture, and to jumpstart the local economy. At a time of mild economic recovery, the KHC22 proved to be very popular and sparked a renewed interest in Kenworth buses. Major operators of the KHC-22 (later expanded to a wheelbase, 33-passenger KHC-33, in September 1933) were the Portland Railway, Light &amp; Power Company of Portland, Oregon, and Spokane United Railways.

Production of Kenworth buses continued throughout the 1930s and into the early 1940s, and during this time Kenworth was manufacturing bus chassis for body builders such as Wentworth and Irwin (later renamed Wentwin), and Heiser. Heiser, long an often chosen body for school buses bearing Kenworth chassis, would later be purchased by Pacific Car and Foundry Company in 1937.

==== Model 870 and 871 ====
In 1933, Kenworth also released its most popular and successful line of transit bus, a conventional styled bus based on their Model 86 heavy duty truck. Powered by a Hercules JXCM engine, the model 870 as it was known, would soon be replaced by a model 871, which became Kenworth&#x27;s standard line of buses throughout the early and mid-1930s. Experiments with &quot;deck-and-a-half&quot; buses would soon follow, made reality in the W-1 model, as well as the company&#x27;s very first experiments with rear-engine coach-type buses in 1936.

==== Transit buses ====
Kenworth changed its production line early in 1939, reflecting a desire to remain &quot;in tune&quot; with market forces. The conventional bus chassis, which had become poor sellers, were dropped altogether, and Kenworth focused its designs on more transit or &quot;coach-type&quot; buses with engines being located either underfloor or at the back of the bus.

By this time, Kenworth was a major force in transit bus production, and nearly every major transit company in the Pacific Northwest were running Kenworth buses. Seattle Municipal Railway purchased several new model 601s to replace the previous model H30s, which were powered by a Hall-Scott 135 engine underfloor and had bodies built by the Pacific Car and Foundry Company. Kenworth also built a model 612, which became the company&#x27;s most widely distributed underfloor coach. 27 were built with 14 wheelbase variations (and seven engine variations), and all 27 were sold by as many as 15 different operators.

=== 1940s ===
At the beginning of the decade, bus customers began to decline in number, but the company received larger orders as several regional operators consolidated into larger, territorial ones. Bremerton Transit purchased several buses in 1940 to accommodate the increase in ridership due to the preparations for the war itself; the same year, the Seattle Municipal Railway purchased 30 buses in a single order, assisting Kenworth in breaking a production record. Producing about 40 buses yearly, Kenworth became a low-volume bus manufacturer, accommodating special-order coaches. Gray Line affiliates Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver purchased several of these special coach orders known as Grayliner or Grayliner Junior buses; the bodies for these buses were all built by Pacific Car and Foundry.

At the onset of World War II, war production took precedence over bus manufacturing as Kenworth supplied recovery vehicles for the U.S. Army. Along with military variations of their commercial truck line, Kenworth buses remained in production for use as troop transports. In 1945, Kenworth was sold to Pacific Car and Foundry; both companies believed bus production would play a pivotal role in jumpstarting a postwar economy. Kenworth also saw the opportunity in hiring former military truck and aircraft workers as part of launching its post-war product line. For 1946, Kenworth launched four new model lines of buses, deriving their model designations from the first four letters of the company name. The Model K was a line of small intercity/interurban buses; the Model E, a trolley coach; the Model N, a city transit bus; the Model W, an intercity bus.

Subsequently, Kenworth added the Model O one-door transit bus and Model T prototype school bus. Ultimately, the company built trolley buses for just one city – a single order of 50 of model E2 built in 1947–48 for the Portland Traction Company, in Portland, Oregon.

==== Model K, N, W ====
Outwardly similar in appearance, the Model K intercity/interurban and Model W intercity bus differed in function, size, and layout. The Model K was shorter, with a capacity of 25-33 passengers; the longer Model W seated 31-41 passengers. The Model K was equipped with a rear-mounted International Red Diamond RD450 while the Model W used a horizontally-mounted underfloor Hall-Scott 190 engine. The Model N, in its original configuration, was a 36-44 passenger bus; after the design found no takers, the vehicle was downsized in 1947 to a 32-36 passenger bus.

After 1947, Kenworth revised its model designations, assigning numerals to its model lines to signify evolutionary variants of each design.

==== Kenworth &quot;Brucks&quot; ====
As production orders for the interurban model Ks and model Ws waned, Kenworth focused its attention on special orders including an order of 10 &quot;Brucks&quot; for Great Northern Railway in Montana, (an earlier version was built for Northern Pacific Transport, but was a split-level coach) and several Highway Post Office coaches.

These &quot;special order coaches&quot; were based on the Model T school bus, which entered production in early 1949. The company also test-marketed a small 20-passenger bus known as the Carcoach (only one example was built).

=== 1950s ===
==== Model T and CT ====
The Model T school bus, which entered production after the last bus was built for Great Northern in April 1949, was an immediate hit with many school bus operators in the Pacific Northwest. The T-126 as it was known, boasted a unique four-pane windshield that offered unheralded forward visibility in any school bus at the time, and was the first school bus ever built to feature a roof escape hatch (now required equipment). Production of the T-126 averaged over 375 buses per year, making it Kenworth&#x27;s most lucrative bus offering in the company&#x27;s history up to that time.

Shortly after its launch, Kenworth renamed the line the model CT. The model CT also came in several varying passenger capacities ranging from 55, 61, 67, 73, and 79 passengers. The model CT &quot;Pacific School Coach&quot; was powered by an International Red Diamond 450 inline six-cylinder gas engine placed at the rear of the bus, and a LeRoi H540 engine was made available for an LR-73 model that was produced in August 1950. Some orders for modified model CTs were made available and sold internationally, with variants being sold to Uruguay and Venezuela, as well as the Middle East.

==== End of production ====
After the boom of school bus production, and to focus more on truck production due to a rising number of heavy duty truck orders, all bus production was shifted from Kenworth over to Pacific Car and Foundry in the middle of 1956. After some final cleanup, PC&amp;F wound up completely outstanding orders for the Pacific School Coach in early 1957. Shortly afterwards, PC&amp;F sold all rights, tooling, and equipment to school bus manufacturer Gillig Bros. of Hayward, California.

Following the acquisition, multiple features of the Model T/CT were integrated into the Gillig Transit Coach line of school buses; the model line was produced until 1982.

===Bus industry legacy===
Kenworth&#x27;s role in the transit and school bus industry has largely been forgotten. This is likely due to a number of factors including Kenworth&#x27;s current status as a leading manufacturer of Class 8 heavy-duty semi trucks, and the fact that hardly any examples of Kenworth-built buses exist today (with exception of a few surviving model CT-73 &quot;Pacific School Coach&quot; buses and one remaining &quot;Bruck&quot;).

In 2006, at the American Truck Historical Society&#x27;s 11th Annual Truck Show at the Mason County Fairgrounds in Shelton, Washington, a historical society dedicated to preserving the Gillig Transit Coach and Kenworth-Pacific School Coach was officially dedicated.

<text>Peterbilt Motors Company is an American truck manufacturer specializing in the production of heavy-duty (Class 8) and medium-duty (Classes 5–7) commercial vehicles. The namesake of company founder T. A. &quot;Al&quot; Peterman, it was established in 1939 from the acquisition of Fageol Truck and Motor Company, and has operated as part of PACCAR since 1958. Competing alongside sister division Kenworth Truck Company, it sustains one of the longest-running marketplace rivalries in American truck manufacturing.

Peterbilt trucks are identified by a red oval emblem that has been in use since 1953. A &quot;bird&quot;-style hood ornament has also been used on conventional-cab trucks since 1965.

Headquartered in Denton, Texas, the company also manufactures trucks at PACCAR facilities in Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec, Canada and Mexicali, Mexico.

==History==
=== Background ===
Peterbilt was born out of the Pacific Northwest logging industry. In the first third of the 20th century, transporting logs remained time-consuming, primarily moved by steam tractors, horse teams, rail, and water. T.A. Peterman was a lumberman located in Tacoma, Washington, seeking to modernize log shipment to lumber mills to manufacture plywood.

In 1934, Peterman acquired 30,000 acres of forestland in Morton, Washington; instead of using railroads, he built roads and acquired a fleet of trucks, purchasing White Motor Company trucks surplused by the U.S. Army. For logging use, the former military vehicles underwent several refurbishments and modifications; along with upgrades to their durability, the trucks underwent a degree of modernization, notably replacing hand cranks with electric starters. Safety changes included the addition of air brakes and air-cooled (finned) brake drums.

On a 1938 business trip in San Francisco, Peterman learned that Fageol Truck and Motor Company was to be sold. Seeking an opportunity to expand into new vehicle production, he acquired Fageol from Sterling Motor Company for $50,000, receiving the 13.5-acre Fageol plant in Oakland, California, its tooling, and parts inventory; the purchase was completed in 1939.

=== 1939-1940s ===
In 1939, the Fageol plant in Oakland opened for business as Peterbilt Motors Company. As part of the design process, Peterman and his company engineers sought input from truck owners and drivers on how to develop trucks; initially planning to develop chain-drive trucks for the logging industry, the company transitioned towards vehicles intended towards highway freight transport. In April 1939, Peterbilt released its first vehicles for public sale, the single-axle Model 260 (chain drive) and the tandem-axle Model 334 (shaft-drive); both vehicles were offered with either gasoline or diesel engines. The 260 and 334 were equipped with an all-steel cab, trimmed with plywood sourced from Peterman-owned lumber mills. In a tradition that would last for the next 40 years, the company would designate single rear-axle trucks with model numbers starting with 2; tandem rear-axle trucks started with 3.

Through the end of the year, Peterbilt produced 16 vehicles; the first Peterbilt was a fire truck chassis built for Centerville (now Fremont), California. For 1940, production increased to 83 vehicles. To supplement its revenue, Peterbilt continued its practice of servicing and refurbishing trucks from all manufacturers.

For 1941, Peterbilt created the heavier-duty Model 364; initially developed for the logging industry, the 364 was re-purposed for military production for World War II. In 1942, the company developed its first cab-over-engine (COE) truck, which was derived from the 260. The vehicle was a half-cab design with a full-deck chassis.

In 1944, production was increased as Peterbilt secured a contract to supply 224 military trucks. In November 1944, T.A. Peterman died from cancer at the age of 51, leaving the company to his wife, Ida.

In 1945, the company resumed production of civilian vehicles; to increase payloads, Peterbilt introduced lighter aluminum-built cabs.

During 1947, Ida Peterman sold Peterbilt Motors Company to a group of company managers and investors for $450,000; while the investors received the company assets, Peterman retained ownership of the company real estate.

In 1949, the company released a second generation of trucks, replacing the 260/334 with the all-new Model 280/350. The &quot;Iron Nose&quot; conventional was distinguished by its tall, narrow grille (with vertical grille shutters) and cycle-style fenders (a design that remains in use today on some Peterbilt conventionals). The first mass-produced COE by Peterbilt, the &quot;Bubble Nose&quot; 280/350 COE relocated the cab of the conventional above the front axle (but still received a short hood).

=== 1950s ===

During the early 1950s, Peterbilt developed the &quot;dromedary&quot; cargo system; a longer-wheelbase truck (typically a COE) was configured to transport a auxiliary cargo system placed between the cab and trailer.

In 1953, Peterbilt introduced its current brand emblem, switching from a rectangular border to the current red oval.

In 1954, the 280/350 underwent a redesign, becoming the Model 281/351 &quot;Narrow-nose&quot; conventional; the grille was redesigned, converting to horizontal grille shutters. A 281/351 COE was introduced, introducing a larger, wider cab design (sharing only the doors with the conventional). The shorter-hood Model 341 was heavier-duty, intended for vocational applications.

In 1958, following a decline in truck sales, Ida Peterman (the owner of the company real estate) announced to company owners her plans to redevelop the factory site as a shopping center. Rather than take on the large investment of developing a new factory, the investment group chose to sell Peterbilt Motors Company in June 1958 to Pacific Car and Foundry, a Seattle-based company that specialized in production of railroad freight cars which had acquired local heavy truck manufacturer Kenworth in 1944. The new owners of Peterbilt began the relocation of the company, keeping it in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1959, construction commenced on a 176,000 square-foot facility in Newark, California.

For 1959, the 281/351 COE was replaced by the 282/352 COE. While externally similar (though upgrading to quad headlamps), in a major change, the new design introduced a tilting cab to allow better access to the engine.

=== 1960s ===

In August 1960, the first Peterbilt trucks were assembled by the Newark, California, factory; production increased to 800 vehicles for 1960. Coinciding with the introduction of the new factory, Peterbilt debuted a redesigned &quot;Unilite&quot; cab for its conventional trucks, distinguished by larger windows and a redesigned interior (including an all-new instrument panel). In an organizational change, Pacific Car changed its ownership status of Peterbilt, converting it from a wholly-owned subsidiary to a division within the company, making it the sister company of marketplace rival Kenworth (a division since 1946).

In 1965, Peterbilt introduced the Model 358, largely replacing the 351 (which remained in production). The first Peterbilt conventional with a tilting hood, the 288/358 replaced a fixed radiator (and grille shutters) with a grille surround attached to the aluminum hood (a fiberglass hood was added as an option in 1972). Serving partially as a grab handle, the Peterbilt &quot;bird&quot; hood ornament made its debut (a feature remaining in current production nearly unchanged).

In 1966, the company expanded its model line beyond highway tractors, reintroducing heavy-duty trucks as part of its model line. Above the Model 341, the Model 383 was a 6x6 truck primarily for off-road construction use.

In 1967, Peterbilt introduced the Model 359 highway tractor. Similar in design to the 358, the 289/359 also used a tilting hood, but was fitted with a larger grille (to accommodate larger diesel engines).

In 1969, Peterbilt expanded its production capability, opening a facility in Madison, Tennessee (suburban Nashville). Along with the ability to meet additional product demand, the location was chosen to serve customers closer to the East Coast. As part of a revision to the cab design, the 282/352 COE adopted the name &quot;Pacemaker&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, the Model 348 was introduced, gradually replacing the 341 (remaining until 1972). Intended for vocational use, the 348 was the first Peterbilt designed with an angled fiberglass hood; the 349 was similar in configuration, designed with a larger grille. Developed in a joint venture with Kenworth, Peterbilt released the CB300, a low-cab COE developed nearly exclusively for refuse transport.

At the beginning of 1972, Pacific Car and Foundry, intending to exit steel manufacturing, introduced its current name, PACCAR. The same year, Peterbilt redesigned the cab for its conventionals, replacing the &quot;Unilite&quot; cab with the &quot;1100-series&quot; cab. Named for 1100 square inches of windshield glass, the new design was taller with redesigned doors, an all-new interior, and increased window space. Designed for the same applications for the slightly larger 383, the Model 346 6x6 was designed with a set-back front axle (placed nearly below the cab). For testing, the company developed a prototype vehicle powered by a jet-turbine engine; the design was not placed into production.

In 1973, the Model 353 was introduced as a construction-oriented variant of the 359 (using its wider grille), replacing the 341 and heavy-duty versions of the 351; production of the Madison facility was doubled, allowing the company to deliver 8,000 vehicles yearly. In 1974, a set-back front axle was added to the 359.

In 1975, Peterbilt expanded its manufacturing base a second time, introducing Peterbilt Canada in Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec (Greater Montreal).; the facility began production of the CB300 (sold by Kenworth as the Hustler). Sized between the 353 and the 383, the 387 was another heavy-duty truck developed primarily for off-road use. The 352 COE underwent a model revision, becoming the 352H (high-mounted cab) to accommodate larger engines.

After a 22-year model run, the 281/351 was retired for 1976. Replaced by the 358 and 359 as the Peterbilt highway tractor over a decade earlier, the 351 had continued production as a heavy-duty truck built primarily for vocational use; in the early 1970s, its cycle-style fenders were replaced by flat steel fenders. The narrow-hood 358 was also retired, as the larger-grille 359 was better suited to the cooling needs of newer diesel engines.

In 1977, Peterbilt assembled its 100,000th vehicle, a long-hood Model 359. The model line underwent minor revisions, as the cab received a revised dashboard and an optional 63-inch sleeper cab with walk-through entry (a first for the model line).

For 1978, the CB300 was replaced by the Model 310. Again shared with Kenworth, the 310 was a new generation of the low-cab COE model line.

By 1979, Peterbilt began to revise its model nomenclature, phasing out separate designations for single rear-axle trucks; all trucks began to use model numbers starting with &quot;3&quot; (regardless of drive configuration).

=== 1980s ===

In 1980, the Model 383 was discontinued, largely replaced by the smaller 353 and 387. To expand the vocationally-oriented 348/349 model family, a lighter-weight highway tractor (the first Peterbilt highway truck with a sloped nose) was added to the model line; the 349H was offered with a straight hood. In 1980, Peterbilt introduced the Model 397; the largest vehicle ever designed by the company, the 397 conventional 6x6 was exclusively for off-road use. Only 2 397s were assembled, one in 1980 and one in 1982. Peterbilt opened its third manufacturing facility in the United States, located in Denton, Texas (northern Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs); the company opened an 80-acre, 435,000 square-foot assembly facility.

In 1981, the Madison facility began assembly of the Model 362 COE. Replacing the 352H, the 362 was the first completely new COE from Peterbilt in 22 years. Distinguished by its curved 3-piece windshield and three windshield wipers (a 4-piece/2-wiper configuration was optional), the 362 was designed with a larger, more aerodynamic cab and a larger, more functional interior. Several axle configurations were offered, including set-back front axles, twin-steer configurations, and all-wheel drive. In total, six cab configurations were offered, ranging from 54 to 110 inches in length.

In 1986, Peterbilt commenced a series of massive changes within both the company and its product line. After 26 years, assembly operations ended at the Newark facility, as the company began production consolidation in Denton; at the time, Newark retained its corporate headquarters and engineering operations. Commencing a transition of the entire Peterbilt model line, the company revised its vocational lineup, as the 378 replaced the 348/349 and the 357 served as a successor to the 353. While trailing other manufacturers by several years, Peterbilt began offering raised-roof sleeper cabs as an option for the 359.

For 1987, the company introduced two different conventional highway tractors, the Model 377 and the Model 379. While more conservative than the design of the Kenworth T600, the 377 used a sloped hood (angled further than the 348/349), a standard set-back front axle, and a wraparound front bumper integrated with the front fenders (later including composite-lens headlamps). Replacing the long-running 359, the 379 served as the standard Class 8 highway tractor; sharing the 1100-series cab with the 359, the 379 was distinguished by its redesigned headlamp clusters and horizontally-mounted windshield wipers (also used on the 377). The Model 310 was redesigned, becoming the Model 320; no longer shared with Kenworth, the 320 allowed the driver to drive in a standing position. For the first time, Peterbilt entered the medium-duty (Class 5-7) market, introducing the Mid-Ranger low-cab COE. Produced in Brazil using a MAN G90 cab (a wider version of the Volkswagen LT), the Mid-Ranger was fitted with American drivetrain components; PACCAR marketed the vehicle through both Kenworth and Peterbilt.

In 1988, Peterbilt introduced a second Class 8 COE, the Model 372 aerodynamically-enhanced highway tractor. Sharing its doors and internal structure with the 362, the 372 was rebodied to maximize both aerodynamics and fuel economy; the three-piece windshield was replaced by a pointed-center design. Designed as part of the cab, the roof fairing extended forward of the windshield; below the windshield, an upward-tilting shroud included the grille. While the 372 did not use a set-back front axle, the design included a wraparound front bumper; skirted body sides were available as an option. Despite its COE configuration (overcoming an inherently massive frontal area), the aerodynamic enhancements of the 372 achieved over 11mpg in real-world testing.

=== 1990s ===
In 1993, Peterbilt ended all operations in Newark, relocating its corporate and engineering headquarters to Denton (alongside its primary manufacturing operations). Coinciding with the consolidation, the company expanded production at the Denton facility.

In 1994, the Model 372 COE ended production, with Peterbilt focusing production on the more mainstream 362. Alongside declining overall demand for COEs, the controversial exterior design of the 372 had seen a poor market response, earning nicknames &quot;football helmet&quot; or &quot;Darth Vader&quot; (among less appropriate ones).

In 1996, the company closed Peterbilt Canada; the Sainte-Thérèse facility had been plagued by multiple strikes and struggled with efficiency (in comparison to the Denton and Madison facilities). In 1997, PACCAR chose to redevelop its Canadian operations, demolishing the facility in 1997 to rebuild an all-new assembly facility in 1999. The Model 385 was introduced as a shorter-length version of the 377; a 112-inch and 120-inch version were offered, the latter eventually replacing the 377.

In 1998, Peterbilt introduced the Model 210/220 COE, a medium-duty (class 6-7) low-cab COE. Replacing the Mid-Ranger, the 210/220 was derived from the DAF LF (coinciding with the PACCAR acquisition of Dutch manufacturer DAF); as with the Mid-Ranger, the design was adapted to an American-sourced powertrain.

In 1999, the Model 387 was introduced, serving as the indirect successor to the 377 (alongside the 385). Completely unrelated to the namesake 1976-1987 heavy-duty truck, the 1999 387 was an aerodynamically-enhanced highway tractor. Sharing its cab structure with the Kenworth T2000 (the first all-new cab design since 1972), the 387 used its own chassis and hood design.

=== 2000s ===

In 2000, Peterbilt introduced the Model 330, its first medium-duty conventional-cab truck. Manufactured by the all-new facility in Sainte-Thérèse, the 330 used the 1100-series cab of the Class 8 conventionals with an all-new hood (distinguished by integrated twin headlamps). During 2000, the 377 ended production, effectively replaced by the 120-inch 385 and the 387.

In 2002, to accommodate increased demand, the company temporarily added production of the 357, 378, 385 vocational trucks and the 379 to Sainte-Thérèse.

In 2005, the Model 362 ended production; following years of declining sales of COEs, the 362 became the final cabover model line sold in North America (leaving only the Freightliner Argosy, itself ending North American sales a year later). As a running change during 2005 production, the doors of the 1100-series cab were revised; distinguished with the deletion of the vent windows and redesigned door handles, the side window brackets were redesigned and relocated from the door to the body. As a more direct successor to the 377, the Model 386 combined the aerodynamic hood of the 387 with the traditional 1100-series cab. The Model 3335 was introduced as a second medium-duty conventional; sized in the Class 6-7 range, the 335 introduced a scaled-down version of the hood from the 386.

In 2006, the medium-duty product line was expanded further. Alongside the Class 7 Model 340, Peterbilt introduced its smallest-ever conventional, the Class 5 Model 325 (the latter, not requiring a CDL to operate). The same year, the company released its first diesel-electric hybrid vehicle, introducing 330 and 335 hybrids. Serving as the successor to the 357 and 378, the 365 and 367 were introduced, serving as heavy-duty Class 8 trucks; along with vocationally-oriented configurations, the model line is also offered as a tractor.

In 2007, the company withdrew the 210/220 medium-duty COEs, as second-party equipment manufacturers found difficulties adapting to its European-based design. After a 20-year production run, the Model 379 was retired, replaced by the Model 389. Sharing its cab with the 2005-2007 379, the 389 was designed with a longer hood (the longest-ever Peterbilt conventional), upgraded headlamps, and aerodynamic improvements.

In 2009, Peterbilt ended production at the Madison, Tennessee facility, consolidating operations between Denton and Sainte-Thérèse. The medium-duty line saw a slight revision; along with adoption of (Cummins-built) PACCAR engines and a redesigned interior, the 335 and 340 were dropped, replaced by the 337 and 348.

=== 2010s ===

In 2010, the Model 587 was introduced as a wide-cab aerodynamic tractor, serving as the successor of the 387. Sharing its cab structure with the Kenworth T700, the 587 (the first Peterbilt with a &quot;5&quot; model designation) adopted a sharper-edged hood from its predecessor, achieving improvements in aerodynamics, forward visibility, and lighting. The Model 382 was introduced as a regional-haul daycab tractor, serving as a shorter/lighter version of the 386/384.

In 2011, the Model 210 and 220 COEs made their return. Assembled in the PACCAR facility in Mexicali, Mexico (alongside the Model 320), the 210/220 now used the chassis of the 325 and 330 (only sourcing the cab assembly with the DAF LF), allowing for increased mechanical commonality and simpler adaption of equipment. As before, the model was shared with Kenworth as the K270/K370. The company introduced a design variant of the Class 8 1100-series cab, introducing an &quot;Extended Ultra Daycab&quot; for non-sleeper; the option included a raised roof and extended rear cab wall.

In 2012, the Model 579 was introduced as the Peterbilt wide-cab aerodynamic tractor. Replacing the 587 (which remained in production), the 579 served as the flagship model line alongside the &quot;traditional&quot; 389. Debuting an all-new cab design (no longer shared with Kenworth), the 579 improved outward visibility (by removing vent windows), further improved aerodynamics (with redesigned body skirting and optimized under-body design), and improved serviceability.

In 2013, the Model 567 was introduced as a Class 8 heavy-duty truck. Sharing its size and functionality with the 367, the 567 adopted the newer cab design of the 579 (fitting it with the headlamps from the 389). Initially offered with a set-back front axle; a set-forward front axle was also introduced in 2015.

In 2014, to commemorate 75 years of production, Peterbilt released a 75th Anniversary Edition of the Model 579, which was painted with a two-tone exterior and a matching interior. The Class 7 Model 220 underwent a redesign (the Class 6 210 was dropped), again mating a DAF LF cab (which underwent a redesign in 2013) to a Peterbilt-sourced cab and drivetrain.

In 2015, the company introduced its first medium-duty trucks fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG), offering it as an option for the 337 and 348. The Model 388 was redesignated, becoming the shorter-length (123-inch) version of the 389.

In 2016, the Model 520 was introduced, replacing the Model 320 after 29 years of production. While nearly visually identical to its predecessor (adding larger windshield wipers and optional LED headlamps), the refuse-collection functionality of the 520 was upgraded, allowing drivers to drive the vehicle sitting or standing from either side of the cab.

In 2018, Peterbilt began testing on its first electric vehicle prototypes, building 12 579s and 3 520s with all-electric powertrains.

=== 2020s ===
In 2021, Peterbilt commenced production of three all-electric model lines, launching the Class 8 579EV tractor, Class 8 520EV low-cab COE, and the Class 7 220EV COE. The medium-duty model line underwent a complete redesign, as the 325, 330, 337, and 348 were discontinued. Adopting the larger cab of the 567 and 579, the Class 5-7 Model 535, 536, 537, and 548 also introduced the rebranding of several PACCAR drivetrain and suspension components.
In 2023, Peterbilt introduced the Model 589 (redesign of the 389), this model still has the long nose hood and same chassis as a 389 but the cab and sleeper (if installed) are different. The new 589 utilizes the 579 2.1M aerodynamic cab with a long nose hood (same design as the Kenworth W990). The cab change to the 2.1M cab is utilized to meet EPA standards with improved aerodynamics and better fuel mileage while having the same look as a 389 long nose.

== Facilities ==
From its 1939 founding to 1960, Peterbilt was based in Oakland, California, using the former Fageol facilities. In 1960, the company was required to relocate, moving to Newark, California. To supplement truck production, the company opened a facility in Madison, Tennessee (suburban Nashville) in 1969. Originally producing the 352/282 COE exclusively, the Madison facility added conventionals during the 1970s; the facility remained open through 2009.

In 1975, the company opened Peterbilt Canada in Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec (Greater Montreal), dedicating production to low-cab COE vehicles (primarily for refuse applications). After its closure in 1996, the facility was demolished in 1997 and rebuilt with an all-new facility opened in 1999. Currently, Sainte-Thérèse assembles Peterbilt medium-duty trucks.

In 1980, Peterbilt opened its current facility at Denton, Texas (northern Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs). At the end of 1986, the company closed its Newark facility, shifting production to Denton; corporate and engineering headquarters remained in California through the end of 1992, after which the company consolidated operations in its Denton facility. In 2009, the Madison facility was closed; all Peterbilt Class 8 conventionals are currently manufactured in Denton.

<doc id="851287" wikidata="Q4632862" url="?curid=851287" title="2929 Entertainment">
<text>2929 Entertainment, LLC. is an American integrated media and entertainment company co-founded by billionaire entrepreneurs Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban. 2929 maintains companies and interests across several industries including entertainment development and packaging, film and television production and distribution, digital and broadcast syndication, theatrical exhibition, and home entertainment.

2929 Entertainment has offices in Los Angeles, New York, and Dallas. Wagner and Cuban co-own 2929 with Sky Hansen serving as managing director.

==History==
2929 Entertainment made several strategic acquisitions to assure that releases could be made available to any audience across a variety of platforms simultaneously. Wagner says that &quot;ready availability of such infrastructure would be an operating advantage to both the circuit and the production company.&quot; Some titles would even see DVD releases alongside theatrical openings as early as 2007, through an early partnership with Netflix.

An extensive catalogue of television and film rights were acquired with Rysher Entertainment in 2001, and 2929 would co-produce a newer version of &quot;Star Search&quot; which premiered in January 2003 on CBS (the original &quot;Star Search&quot; aired from 1983 to 1995).

&quot;Variety&quot; praised 2929 as a &quot;pioneer&quot; for its simultaneous theatrical and cable television release of Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Bubble&quot; in 2006. &quot;Bubble&quot; was the first of several films with concurrent releases in theaters and through 2929&#x27;s cable channel HDNet. At the time, this move was controversial as most films are released in different formats on a staggered schedule, giving each channel an exclusive window. Exhibitors were especially timorous, as many feared that they would eventually lose their exclusive release windows for more mainstream films.

==Operations==
===Production companies===
2929 Entertainment develops original feature and series through its production company 2929 Productions, and formerly through HDNet Films.

====2929 Productions, LLC====

2929 Productions, LLC. was co-founded by Wagner and Cuban in 2002. The film and television studio selectively finances and develops feature films and series, often through partnerships with industry creators or entertainment companies.

2929 Productions is headed by Haley Jones. Previous studio leadership has included Ben Cosgrove (formerly of Paramount and Section Eight) and Marc Butan (MadRiver Pictures and formerly Lionsgate).

&quot;Godsend&quot;, &quot;Criminal&quot; and &quot;The Jacket&quot; were among of the studio&#x27;s first projects, with the latter two being co-produced and co-financed with Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney&#x27;s Section Eight Productions. After his work on &quot;Godsend,&quot; Marc Butan was offered studio head at 2929 leading him to exit an EVP role at Lionsgate.

In 2005, 2929 Productions released &quot;Good Night, And Good Luck.&quot; with Warner Independent. The film uses a mix of archival footage and contemporary production to tell the story of the famed wartime reporter Edward Murrow (David Strathairn) and his historic &quot;See it Now&quot; broadcast criticizing Senator Joseph McCarthy and the Red Scare. To mitigate risks that could arise with a black-and-white feature film, Wagner engaged Jeff Skoll and his company Participant Media to produce &quot;Good Night, And Good Luck&quot;, which grossed over $30 million (USA) and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

====HDNet Films====
HDNet Films, the motion picture division of the HDNet network (now AXS TV), produced lower budget movies in high definition.
===Distribution===
Originally formed in 2001 by Bill Banowsky and Eamonn Bowles, Magnolia Pictures is the home entertainment and theatrical distribution subsidiary of 2929. In November 2005 the company created Magnolia Home Entertainment to release its films over home video, with its first release being Alex Gibney&#x27;s acclaimed doc, &quot;&quot;. It is headed by entertainment industry vet and former head of home entertainment for Miramax, Randy Wells. Magnolia Pictures also provides its content through a curated streaming service, Magnolia Selects.

2929 also launched Truly Indie, an &quot;innovative distribution program&quot; for independent filmmakers.

===Television===
2929 holds a significant interest in AXS TV, which Cuban originally co-founded in 2001 as the all-high definition cable channel HDNet (through AXS TV LLC, formerly HDNet, LLC). HDNet Movies, a companion channel, shows movies in high definition. 2929 also owned Rysher Entertainment, a television syndication distributor with an extensive library of titles and syndication rights to TV shows like &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Star Search&quot;. Rysher was later acquired by an investment company through Lakeshore Entertainment.

==Former operations==
===Theatrical exhibition===
2929 acquired Landmark Theatres September 24, 2003. The chain was originally founded by Kim Jorgensen in 1974 and specialized in independent and foreign films.
On December 4, 2018 the announcement was made that Landmark Theatres was sold to the Cohen Media Group, &quot;a buyer who is passionate about independent cinema and who truly understands this market.&quot;

2929 maintains an interest in Spotlight Cinema Networks, a cinema advertising company.

<doc id="851289" wikidata="Q3907458" url="?curid=851289" title="Problem-oriented policing">
<text>Problem-oriented policing (POP), coined by University of Wisconsin–Madison professor Herman Goldstein, is a policing strategy that involves the identification and analysis of specific crime and disorder problems, in order to develop effective response strategies. POP requires police to identify and target underlying problems that can lead to crime. Goldstein suggested it as an improvement on the reactive, incident-driven &quot;standard model of policing&quot;. 

Goldstein&#x27;s 1979 model was expanded in 1987 by John E. Eck and William Spelman into the Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment (SARA) model for problem-solving. This strategy places more emphasis on research and analysis as well as crime prevention and the engagement of public and private organizations in the reduction of community problems.

A systematic review of this model, based on 34 randomized control trials and quasi-experimental studies, found that problem-oriented policing is effective at reducing crime and disorder, but had a limited effect on police legitimacy and fear of crime. There is also the risk of overreach, corruption, and abuse of authority, when officers interfere before crimes have actually occurred. 

== History ==
==Criticism==
Problem-oriented policing can have some unintended consequences, including displacement of the problem from its origins. The majority of problem-oriented policing projects fail to investigate displacement. Law enforcement is generally satisfied to achieve a crime reduction in the targeted area and may be less concerned if crime is displaced outside their jurisdiction. However, assessing and understanding potential displacement effects can help ensure the effectiveness of problem-oriented policing. Response to criticism of POP based on this unintended consequence has been challenged: a systematic review published in 2011 argued that while displacement is viewed as a negative consequence of crime prevention efforts, it can provide benefits. 

Another criticism comes from a particular challenge to many policing approaches: trust. If a community has no trust in law enforcement, then law enforcement and the community will have friction. As difficult as it is often for police officers to obtain &quot;buy-in&quot; within, it is often even more difficult to convince people outside the police department, such as community partners, to carry out specific tasks faithfully and properly without a negative inference of its inadequacy in satisfying the expectations of the masses.

== Evaluations ==
Michael Scott&#x27;s 20-year retrospective concludes: &quot;After 20 years, problem-oriented policing has demonstrated an internal logic that has been successfully applied at the project level and remains a promising approach for the foreseeable future.&quot;

<text>Cable One, Inc. is an American broadband communications provider. Under the Sparklight brand, it provides cable television, internet, and phone services to 24 U.S. states and 1.1 million residential and business customers. It also owns the Fidelity Communications brand, which provides the same services in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. Fidelity was founded in 1940. It is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, though it does not serve that metro area.

==History==
Originally established in 1986 as a subsidiary of Graham Holdings Company known as Post-Newsweek Cable, its name was changed to Cable One in 1997. 

In June 2015, Graham Holdings Company distributed 100% of Cable One’s common stock to GHC shareholders in a tax-free transaction. Cable One became an independent publicly traded company as Cable One, Inc. and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CABO.

In summer 2019, Cable One rebranded its residential services division as Sparklight, seeking to promote its internet services more than cable TV offerings. Equipment with Cable One branding is still used by existing customers, with new customers receiving equipment with Sparklight branding. Cable One&#x27;s original URL, cableone.net, redirects to sparklight.com.

Sparklight provides broadband service via cable (DOCSIS) through most of its footprint, and fiber-to-the-home in limited areas. 

Sparklight provides phone service plans such as Economy Phone, Standard Phone, and Elite Package with Starter Plan Plus.

Sparklight offers three cable TV plans: Economy Cable TV, Standard Cable TV, and Elite 100 Plus. Cable TV can also be accessed on Apple iPhone, Android, Windows, Roku, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Nook through Sparklight&#x27;s TV Everywhere service. Sparklight offers a Digital Value Pack which includes channels such as Red Zone, HBO, and Showtime as add-ons. Cable channels owned by Paramount Global that were owned by Viacom before the merger with CBS Corporation that formed Paramount are notably absent from Cable One&#x27;s lineup after 2014 due to disagreements between Viacom and Cable One.

In 2020, Cable One announced a new IPTV-based service, Sparklight TV, which was made available to many areas throughout 2021. Existing cable customers are not yet required to transfer to Sparklight TV, but cable through a cable box is no longer offered to new customers.

<doc id="851295" wikidata="Q5160952" url="?curid=851295" title="Congressional Record">
<text>The Congressional Record is the official record of the proceedings and debates of the United States Congress, published by the United States Government Publishing Office and issued when Congress is in session. The Congressional Record Index is updated daily online and published monthly. At the end of a session of Congress, the daily editions are compiled in bound volumes constituting the permanent edition. Chapter 9 of Title 44 of the United States Code authorizes publication of the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;.

The &quot;Congressional Record&quot; consists of four sections: the House section, the Senate section, the Extensions of Remarks, and, since the 1940s, the Daily Digest. At the back of each daily issue is the Daily Digest, which summarizes the day&#x27;s floor and committee activities and serves as a table of contents for each issue. The House and Senate sections contain proceedings for the separate chambers of Congress.

A section of the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; titled &quot;Extensions of Remarks&quot; contains speeches, tributes and other extraneous words that were not uttered during open proceedings of the full Senate or of the full House of Representatives. Witnesses in committee hearings are often asked to submit their complete testimony &quot;for the record&quot; and only deliver a summary of it in person. The full statement will then appear in a printed volume of the hearing identified as &quot;Statements for the Record&quot;. In years past, this particular section of the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; was called the &quot;Appendix&quot;. While members of either body may insert material into Extensions of Remarks, Senators rarely do so. The overwhelming majority of what is found there is entered at the request of Members of the House of Representatives. From a legal standpoint, most materials in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; are classified as secondary authority, as part of a statute&#x27;s legislative history.

By custom and rules of each house, members also frequently &quot;revise and extend&quot; their remarks made on the floor before the debates are published in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;. Therefore, for many years, speeches that were not delivered in Congress appeared in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, including in the sections purporting to be verbatim reports of debates. In recent years, however, these revised remarks have been preceded by a &quot;bullet&quot; symbol or, more recently and currently, printed in a typeface discernibly different from that used to report words spoken by members.

The &quot;Congressional Record&quot; is publicly available for records before 1875 via the Library of Congress&#x27; American Memory Century of Lawmaking website, and since 1989 via Congress.gov (which replaced the THOMAS database in 2016). Thanks to a partnership between GPO and the Library of Congress, digital versions of the bound editions are available on govinfo.gov for 1873 to 2001 (Volumes 1-147) and 2005 to 2015 (Volumes 151-161). Govinfo.gov also provides access to digital versions of the daily edition from 1994 (Volume 140) to the present.

== History ==
In early United States history, there was no record of Congressional debates. The contemporary British Parliament from which Congress drew its tradition was a highly secretive body, and publishing parliamentary proceedings in Britain did not become legal until 1771. The Constitution, in Article I, Section 5, requires Congress to keep a journal of its proceedings, but both the &quot;House Journal&quot; and the &quot;Senate Journal&quot; include only a bare record of actions and votes rather than records of debates. In the first twenty years, Congress made frequent use of secret sessions. Beginning with the War of 1812, public sessions became commonplace. 

In the early 1800s, political reporting was dominated by &quot;National Intelligencer,&quot; the first newspaper of Washington, D.C. Newspapers with reporters in the chamber regularly published floor statements in their reports. Joseph Gales and William Seaton, the editors of the &quot;Intelligencer&quot;, became regular fixtures in the House and Senate chambers. 

In 1824, Gales and Seaton began publishing the &quot;Register of Debates&quot;, the first series of publications containing congressional debates. The &quot;Register of Debates&quot; contains summaries of &quot;leading debates and incidents&quot; of the period rather than a verbatim debate transcript. From 1834 to 1856, Gale and Seaton retroactively compiled the &quot;Annals of Congress&quot;, covering congressional debates from 1789 to 1824 using primarily newspaper accounts. 

When Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Democrats came into power in congress around 1830, Gales and Seaton&#x27;s popularity declined due to their differing views with the administration. The new printing partnership of Francis Preston Blair and John Cook Rives founded the &quot;Congressional Globe&quot; in 1833 with President Jackson&#x27;s support. In 1837, &quot;Register of Debates&quot; ceased publication. 

In 1851, the &quot;Congressional Globe&quot; began publishing near-verbatim reports of debates thanks to the publication&#x27;s heavy use of stenographers. 

The &quot;Congressional Record&quot; was first published in 1873.

<doc id="851297" wikidata="Q604716" url="?curid=851297" title="Seed drill">
<text>A seed drill is a device used in agriculture that sows seeds for crops by positioning them in the soil and burying them to a specific depth while being dragged by a tractor. This ensures that seeds will be distributed evenly.

The seed drill sows the seeds at the proper seeding rate and depth, ensuring that the seeds are covered by soil. This saves them from being eaten by birds and animals, or being dried up due to exposure to the sun. With seed drill machines, seeds are distributed in rows; this allows plants to get sufficient sunlight, nutrients from the soil.

Before the introduction of the seed drill, most seeds were planted by hand broadcasting, an imprecise and wasteful process with a poor distribution of seeds and low productivity. Use of a seed drill can improve the ratio of crop yield (seeds harvested per seed planted) by as much as eight times. The use of seed drill saves time and labor.

Some machines for metering out seeds for planting are called planters. The concepts evolved from ancient Chinese practice and later evolved into mechanisms that pick up seeds from a bin and deposit them down a tube.

Seed drills of earlier centuries included single-tube seed drills in Sumer and multi-tube seed drills in China, and later a seed drill in 1701 by Jethro Tull that was influential in the growth of farming technology in recent centuries. Even for a century after Tull, hand-sowing of grain remained common.

==Function==

Many seed drills consist of a hopper filled with seeds arranged above a series of tubes that can be set at selected distances from each other to allow optimum growth of the resulting plants. Seeds are spaced out using fluted paddles which rotate using a geared drive from one of the drill&#x27;s land wheels. The seeding rate is altered by changing gear ratios. Most modern drills use air to convey seeds in plastic tubes from the seed hopper to the colters. This arrangement enables seed drills to be much wider than the seed hopper—as much as 12m wide in some cases. The seed is metered mechanically into an air stream created by a hydraulically powered onboard fan and conveyed initially to a distribution head which sub-divides the seeds into the pipes taking the seeds to the individual colters.

Before the operation of a conventional seed drill, hard ground has to be plowed and harrowed to soften it enough to be able to get the seeds to the right depth and make a good &quot;seedbed&quot;, providing the right mix of moisture, stability, space and air for seed germination and root development. The plow digs up the earth and the harrow smooths the soil and breaks up any clumps. In the case that the soil is not as compacted as to need a plow, it can also be tilled by less deeply disturbing tools, before drilling. 
The least interruption of soil structure and soil fauna happens when a type of drilling machine is used which is outfitted to be able to &quot;direct drill&quot;; &quot;direct&quot; referring to sowing into narrow rows opened by single teeth placed in front of every seed-dispensing tube, directly into/ between the partly composted remains (stubble) of the last crop (directly into an untilled field). 
The drill must be set for the size of the seed used. After this the grain is put in the hopper on top, from which the seed grains flow down to the drill which spaces and plants the seed. 
This system is still used today but has been updated and modified over time in many aspects; the most visible example being very wide machines with which one farmer can plant many rows of seed at the same time.

A seed drill can be pulled across the field, depending on the type, using draft animals, like bullocks or by a power engine, usually a tractor. Seeds sown using a seed drill are distributed evenly and placed at the correct depth in the soil.

== Precursors ==

In older methods of planting, a field is initially prepared with a plow to a series of linear cuts known as &quot;furrows&quot;. The field is then seeded by throwing the seeds over the field, a method known as &quot;manual broadcasting&quot;. The seeds may not be sown to the right depth nor the proper distance from one another. Seeds that land in the furrows have better protection from the elements, and natural erosion or manual raking will cover them while leaving some exposed. The result is a field planted roughly in rows, but having a large number of plants outside the furrow lanes.

There are several downsides to this approach. The most obvious is that seeds that land outside the furrows will not have the growth shown by the plants sown in the furrow since they are too shallow on the soil. Because of this, they are lost to the elements. Many of the seeds remain on the surface where they are vulnerable to being eaten by birds or carried away on the wind. Surface seeds commonly never germinate at all or germinate prematurely, only to be killed by frost.

Since the furrows represent only a portion of the field&#x27;s area, and broadcasting distributes seeds fairly evenly, this results in considerable wastage of seeds. Less obvious are the effects of over seeding; all crops grow best at a certain density, which varies depending on the soil and weather conditions. Additional seeding above this will actually reduce crop yields, in spite of more plants being sown, as there will be competition among the plants for the minerals, water, and the soil available. Another reason is that the mineral resources of the soil will also deplete at a much faster rate, thereby directly affecting the growth of the plants.

== History ==
While the Babylonians used primitive seed drills around 1400 BCE, the invention never reached Europe. Multi-tube iron seed drills were invented by the Chinese in the 2nd century BCE. This multi-tube seed drill has been credited with giving China an efficient food production system that allowed it to support its large population for millennia. This multi-tube seed drill may have been introduced into Europe following contacts with China. In the Indian subcontinent, the seed drill was in widespread use among peasants by the time of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century.

The first known European seed drill was attributed to Camillo Torello and patented by the Venetian Senate in 1566. A seed drill was described in detail by Tadeo Cavalina of Bologna in 1602. In England, the seed drill was further refined by Jethro Tull in 1701 in the Agricultural Revolution. However, seed drills of this and successive types were both expensive and unreliable, as well as fragile. Seed drills would not come into widespread use in Europe until the mid to late 19th century, when manufacturing advances such as machine tools, die forging and metal stamping allowed large scale precision manufacturing of metal parts.

Early drills were small enough to be pulled by a single horse, and many of these remained in use into the 1930s. The availability of steam, and later gasoline tractors, however, saw the development of larger and more efficient drills that allowed farmers to seed ever larger tracts in a single day.

Recent improvements to drills allow seed-drilling without prior tilling. This means that soils subject to erosion or moisture loss are protected until the seed germinates and grows enough to keep the soil in place. This also helps prevent soil loss by avoiding erosion after tilling. The development of the press drill was one of the major innovations in pre-1900 farming technology.

== Impact ==
The invention of the seed drill dramatically improved germination. The seed drill employed a series of runners spaced at the same distance as the plowed furrows. These runners, or drills, opened the furrow to a uniform depth before the seed was dropped. Behind the drills were a series of presses, metal discs which cut down the sides of the trench into which the seeds had been planted, covering them over.

This innovation permitted farmers to have precise control over the depth at which seeds were planted. This greater measure of control meant that fewer seeds germinated early or late and that seeds were able to take optimum advantage of available soil moisture in a prepared seedbed. The result was that farmers were able to use less seed and at the same time experience larger yields than under the broadcast methods.

The seed drill allows farmers to sow seeds in well-spaced rows at specific depths at a specific seed rate; each tube creates a hole of a specific depth, drops in one or more seeds, and covers it over. This invention gives farmers much greater control over the depth that the seed is planted and the ability to cover the seeds without back-tracking. The result is an increased rate of germination, and a much-improved crop yield (up to eight times compared to broadcast seeding).

The use of a seed drill also facilitates weed control. Broadcast seeding results in a random array of growing crops, making it difficult to control weeds using any method other than hand weeding. A field planted using a seed drill is much more uniform, typically in rows, allowing weeding with a hoe during the growing season. Weeding by hand is laborious and inefficient. Poor weeding reduces crop yield, so this benefit is extremely significant.

<text>The Jim Henson Company, Inc., formerly known as Muppets, Inc., Henson Associates, Inc., and Jim Henson Productions, Inc. (commonly referred to as Henson), is an American entertainment company located in Los Angeles, California. The company is known for its innovations in the field of puppetry, particularly through the creation of Kermit the Frog and the Muppets characters.

Brian Henson is chairman and Lisa Henson is CEO. Since 2000, The Jim Henson Company is headquartered at the Jim Henson Company Lot, the historic former Charlie Chaplin Studios, in Hollywood.

The company was established in November 1958 by puppeteers Jim and Jane Henson, and is currently independently owned and operated by their children. Henson has produced many successful television series, including &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1976–1981), &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; (1983–1987), and &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; (1997–2006); as well, the company designed the Muppet characters for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (1969–present).

The company has also produced theatrical films, including &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979), &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982) and &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986). Henson also operates Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop, an animatronics and visual effects studio which has created characters and effects for both Henson productions and outside projects. In 1989, the company entered merger negotiations with The Walt Disney Company, which were canceled following Jim Henson&#x27;s death in 1990.

Subsequently, control of the company was assumed by Henson&#x27;s children: Lisa, Cheryl, Brian, John, and Heather. In 2000, Henson was sold to German media company EM.TV &amp; Merchandising AG; by the end of that year, however, EM.TV&#x27;s stock collapsed, and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003.

In the interim, EM.TV sold the rights to the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets to Sesame Workshop in early January 2001, following a December 2000 announcement. Henson sold The Muppets and &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; properties to Disney in 2004, but retains the remainder of its program library and assets.

, Brian, Lisa, Cheryl, and Heather Henson maintain control of the company. Their mother, Jane Henson, died in April 2013 and brother, John Henson, died in February 2014.

==History==

===1958 to 1990===
Jim and Jane Henson officially founded Muppets, Inc. on November 20, 1958, three years after &quot;Sam and Friends&quot; debuted on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. Aside from &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, the majority of its work until 1969 was in advertising; appearances on late-night talk shows; and short &quot;meeting films&quot; primarily for enterprise use, produced from 1965 to 1996. In 1968, the company began designing characters and producing short films for the fledgling &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which premiered on NET (succeeded by PBS) in November 1969.

One of the company&#x27;s first characters to appear regularly on television, Rowlf the Dog, originated in commercials for Purina Dog Chow and became a regular character on &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot; from 1963 to 1966. During this time, the show&#x27;s host, Jimmy Dean, refused an opportunity to own 40% of the company, assuming that he did not attain that right. Jim Henson also pitched several different projects to the major American television networks, to little avail. Some ideas became unaired pilots, while others were never produced.
In 1976, producer Lew Grade approached Henson to produce a weekly series in Grade&#x27;s native United Kingdom. This series became &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, produced by Associated Television (ATV) for the ITV network. The success of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; led to the Muppets becoming an enduring media franchise. Another company controlled by Grade, ITC Entertainment, originally owned &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, among other Henson productions, but Henson acquired the rights to these productions in the 1980s. During this time, Henson formed Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop, a special effects studio partially responsible for the films &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;; and television series &quot;The StoryTeller&quot;, &quot;Farscape&quot;, and &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;.
Later in his life, Henson produced &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; and &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;. In August 1989, Henson and Disney CEO Michael Eisner began merger discussions reportedly valued at $150 million, which also included a fifteen-year contract for Henson&#x27;s personal &quot;creative services.&quot; However, the deal did not include the rights to the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters, which were owned by Henson, although merchandising revenue was split between Henson and the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop.

Also during the negotiations, management of the company&#x27;s Henson International Television distribution unit based in the United Kingdom purchased their unit from the company, leading to the establishment of HIT Entertainment. On May 16, 1990, as negotiations continued, Jim Henson died of toxic shock syndrome. Following Henson&#x27;s death, neither Disney nor Jim Henson Productions could come to an accord. Negotiations officially ended in December 1990, and Henson remained an independent company.

===1991 to 1999===
The Henson family assumed management of the company, and Brian Henson was named president, chairman, and CEO in January 1991. In the following years, Henson entered into deals with several companies, including television rights to the Henson library with Disney Channel and Nickelodeon; a record label with BMG Kidz; and a home media label with Buena Vista Home Video. In 1995, Henson entered into an agreement with ABC to produce primetime television series, leading to &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; and &quot;Aliens in the Family&quot;.

Following the releases of &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; by Walt Disney Pictures, Henson formed Jim Henson Pictures with Sony Pictures Entertainment. In 1998, the company signed a deal with Columbia TriStar Home Video to launch Jim Henson Home Entertainment. By 1999, Henson held partial interests in two cable channels: The Kermit Channel (broadcasting in Asia) and Odyssey Network (broadcasting in the United States), both jointly owned with Hallmark Entertainment. After Hallmark (through Crown Media Holdings) assumed full ownership of these networks, the Kermit Channel was discontinued and Odyssey was renamed the Hallmark Channel.

===2000 to 2004===

In 2000, the Henson family sold the company to the German media company EM.TV &amp; Merchandising AG, for $680 million. That summer, EM.TV sold Henson&#x27;s stakes in the Odyssey and Kermit cable channels in exchange for an 8.2% stake in Hallmark-controlled Crown Media Holdings. By the end of 2000, after EM.TV subsequently experienced major financial problems, EM.TV sold the company&#x27;s ownership of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets and Henson&#x27;s small interest in the Noggin television network to Sesame Workshop, and by early 2001, Henson itself was marked for sale. Disney, Viacom, HIT Entertainment, AOL Time Warner, Haim Saban, Classic Media, as well as Henson management, among others, were all parties reportedly interested in acquiring the company.

In December 2002, a deal was announced in which EM.TV would sell a 49.9% stake in Henson to an investment group led by Dean Valentine, a former executive at Disney and UPN. However, in March 2003, the deal was canceled, citing financial issues on Valentine&#x27;s part. In May 2003, EM.TV was reportedly nearing an agreement to sell Henson to a consortium between Classic Media and Sesame Workshop (with financing from Sony Pictures Entertainment), until the Henson family re-acquired the company for a closing price of $84 million.

In February 2004, Henson sold the Muppets and &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; to Disney, who subsequently formed The Muppets Studio (known at that time as The Muppets Holding Company). The term &quot;Muppet&quot;, likewise, became a legal trademark of Disney; Sesame Workshop retained permission to use the term for its &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters under a perpetuity license from Disney.

===2004 to present===
On April 1, 2004, Henson and HIT Entertainment agreed to a five-year global distribution and production deal which included distribution of 440 hours of the company&#x27;s remaining library including &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Hoobs&quot; and &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Mother Goose Stories&quot;. In addition, the agreement also included the production of new properties, including &quot;Frances&quot;, in which both companies co-produced and also both co-own the copyright to the series. After that deal expired, Henson entered into similar agreements with Lionsgate Home Entertainment on August 10, 2009 and later with Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment three years later on October 25, 2012. As well, the company became involved with computer-animated projects, including the direct-to-video &quot;Unstable Fables&quot; series; &quot;Sid the Science Kid&quot;; &quot;Dinosaur Train&quot;; and &quot;Splash and Bubbles&quot;, as well as the puppet series &quot;Pajanimals&quot;.

Henson later formed Henson Alternative, which specializes in adult content, including the live shows known alternatively as &quot;Puppet Improv&quot;, &quot;Puppet Up!&quot;, and &quot;Stuffed and Unstrung&quot;. In recent years, the &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; characters have made several appearances, usually at special events. The characters appeared with Ben Folds Five in the music video for &quot;Do It Anyway&quot;; and in 2013, Gobo and Red Fraggle hosted a &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; marathon on the Hub Network.

In 2019, &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;, a prequel to &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, premiered on Netflix. In 2022, &quot;Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock&quot;, a reboot of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, premiered on Apple TV+.

On August 10, 2022, the company signed a worldwide distribution agreement with Shout! Factory which would allow Shout! to distribute thirteen series and specials from the Henson catalog on home entertainment and streaming platforms across all territories. A similar worldwide distribution agreement went into effect on January 5, 2024, for streaming, video on demand, broadcast, digital download, packaged media and certain non-theatrical rights for the films &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, as well as behind the scenes specials &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The World of the Dark Crystal&quot;.

On June 20, 2024, the company announced they were planning to sell the Jim Henson Company Lot off La Brea Avenue in Hollywood, which it purchased in 1999, as “part of a much longer-term strategy to have The Jim Henson Company and our renowned Burbank-based Jim Henson’s Creature Shop under one roof, which is not feasible in Hollywood due to the space the Shop requires.” In November of 2024, film producer McG and musician John Mayer bought the lot for $40 million.

On February 25, 2025, the company appointed DeAPlaneta Entertainment as its distributor and licensor for several Henson properties such as &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur Train&quot;, &quot;Dot.&quot; and &quot;Pajanimals&quot; in European territories.

From 1969 to 2000, Henson was contracted to design and create Muppet characters for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. With the exception of occasional appearances in the Muppets franchise, the characters were used exclusively for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, but Henson legally owned these characters prior to their acquisition by Sesame Workshop. The only exception was Kermit the Frog, who was featured in other projects prior to &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Sesame Workshop retains the rights to use any &quot;Sesame Street&quot; footage featuring the character.

The sale ended any direct affiliation between The Muppets and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, although the series retains use of the term &quot;Muppet&quot; under license from Disney. Many of the puppeteers continue to perform with both The Muppets and &quot;Sesame Street&quot; franchises. While no longer owning the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters, Henson continues to design them. This list excludes pre-2001 &quot;Sesame Street&quot; co-productions outside the United States.

<doc id="851302" wikidata="Q2741799" url="?curid=851302" title="New York City English">
<text>New York City English, or Metropolitan New York English, is a regional dialect of American English spoken primarily in New York City and some of its surrounding metropolitan area. It is described by sociolinguist William Labov as the most recognizable regional dialect in the United States. Its pronunciation system—the New York accent—is widely represented in American media by many public figures and fictional characters. Major features of the accent include a high, gliding vowel (in words like &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;caught&quot;); a split of the &quot;short a&quot; vowel into two separate sounds; variable dropping of &quot;r&quot; sounds; and a lack of the &quot;cot–caught&quot;, &quot;Mary–marry–merry&quot;, and &quot;hurry–furry&quot; mergers heard in many other American accents.

Today, New York City English is associated particularly with urban New Yorkers of lower and middle socioeconomic status who are descended from 19th- and 20th-century European immigrants. The dialect is spoken in all five boroughs of the City and throughout Long Island&#x27;s Nassau County; it is also heard to varying degrees in Suffolk County (Long Island), Westchester County, and Rockland County of New York State plus Hudson County, Bergen County, and the city of Newark (Essex County) in northeastern New Jersey.

==History==
The origins of many of New York City English&#x27;s diverse features are probably not recoverable. New York City English, largely with the same major pronunciation system popularly recognized today, was first reproduced in literature and scientifically documented in the 1890s. It was then, and still mostly is, associated with ethnically diverse European-American native-English speakers. The entire Mid-Atlantic United States, including both New York City and the Delaware Valley (whose own distinct dialect centers around Philadelphia and Baltimore) shares certain key features, including a high vowel with a glide (sometimes called the &quot;aww&quot; vowel) as well as a phonemic split of the short &quot;a&quot; vowel, (making &quot;gas&quot; and &quot;gap&quot;, for example, have different vowels sounds)—New York City&#x27;s split not identical though to Philadelphia&#x27;s. Linguist William Labov has pointed out that a similarly structured (though differently pronounced) split is found today even in the southern accents of England; thus, a single common origin of this split may trace back to colonial-era England.

New York City became an urban economic power in the eighteenth century, with the city&#x27;s financial elites maintaining close ties with the British Empire even after the Revolutionary War. According to Labov, New York City speakers&#x27; loss of the &quot;r&quot; sound after vowels (incidentally, not found in the nearby Delaware Valley) began as a nineteenth-century imitation of the prestigious British feature, consistently starting among the upper classes in New York City before spreading to other socioeconomic classes. After World War II, social perceptions reversed and &quot;r&quot;-preserving (rhotic) pronunciations became the new American prestige standard, rejecting East Coast and British accent features, while postwar migrations transferred rhotic speakers directly to New York City from other regions of the country. The result is that non-rhoticity, which was once a high-status feature and later a city-wide feature, has been diminishing and now, since the mid-twentieth century onward, largely remains only among lower-status New Yorkers. Today, New York City metropolitan accents are often rhotic or variably rhotic.

Other features of the dialect, such as the dental pronunciations of &quot;d&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, and related &quot;th&quot;-stopping, likely come from contact with foreign languages, particularly Italian and Yiddish, brought into New York City through its huge immigration waves of Europeans during the mid-to-late nineteenth century and twentieth century. Grammatical structures, such as the lack of inversion in indirect questions, similarly suggest contact with immigrant languages, plus several words common in the city are derived from such foreign languages.

===Influence on other dialects===
Philadelphians born in the twentieth century exhibit a short-&quot;a&quot; split system that some linguists regard as a simplification of the very similar New York City short-&quot;a&quot; split. Younger Philadelphians, however, are retreating from many of the traditional features shared in common with New York City. Due to an influx of immigrants from New York City and neighboring New Jersey to southern Florida, some resident southern Floridians now speak with an accent reminiscent of a New York accent. Additionally, as a result of social and commercial contact between New Orleans, Louisiana and New York City, the traditional accent of New Orleans, known locally as &quot;Yat&quot;, bears distinctive similarities with the New York accent, including the (moribund) coil–curl merger, raising of the vowel to , a similar split in the short-&quot;a&quot; system, and &quot;th&quot;-stopping. Similarly, dialectal similarities suggest that older New York City English also influenced Cincinnati, Ohio and Albany, New York, whose older speakers in particular may still exhibit a short-&quot;a&quot; split system that linguists suggest is an expanded or generalized variant of the New York City short-&quot;a&quot; system. Certain New York City dialect features also understandably appear in New York Latino English.

===Recent developments===
Though William Labov argued in 2010 that the New York City accent is basically stable at the moment, some recent studies have revealed a trend of recession in most features of the accent, especially among younger speakers from middle-class or higher backgrounds. Documented loss of New York City accent features includes the loss of the coil–curl merger (now almost completely extinct), non-rhoticity, and the extremely raised long vowel (as in &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;cough&quot;, or &quot;law&quot;). Researchers proposed that the motivation behind these recessive trends is the stigmatization of the typical New York City accent since the mid-1900s as being associated with a poorer or working-class background, often also corresponding with particular ethnic identities. While earlier projects detected trends of emphasizing New York City accents as part of a process of social identification, recent research attributes the loss of typical accent features to in-group ethnic distancing. In other words, many of the young generations of ethnic groups who formerly were the most representative speakers of the accent are currently avoiding its features to not stand out socially or ethnically.

==Pronunciation==

The pronunciation of New York City English, most popularly acknowledged by the term &quot;New York accent&quot;, is readily noticed and stereotyped, garnering considerable attention in American culture. Some distinctive phonological features include its traditional dropping of &quot;r&quot; except before vowels, a short-&quot;a&quot; split system (in which, for example, the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;gas&quot; is not assonant to the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;gap&quot;), a high gliding vowel (in words like &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, etc. and thus an absence of the cot–caught merger), absence of the Mary–marry–merry merger, and the highly stigmatized (and largely now-extinct) coil–curl merger.

==Vocabulary and grammar==
These are some words or grammatical constructions used mainly in Greater New York City:
*&quot;&quot; : a small neighborhood convenience store; used in recent decades, particularly in New York City though not on Long Island generally; it comes from Spanish, originally meaning &quot;a wine storehouse&quot; via the Puerto Rican Spanish term for &quot;small store; corner store&quot;; by extension, &quot;bodega cats&quot; is the term for the cats that inhabit such establishments. These small stores may also be called , which is the short form of &quot;delicatessens&quot;.
*&quot;bubkes&quot; : a worthless amount; little or nothing (from Yiddish; probably an abbreviation of &quot;kozebubkes&quot;, literally, &quot;goat droppings&quot;)
*&quot;dungarees&quot;: an older term for blue jeans
*&quot;egg cream&quot;: a mixture of cold milk, chocolate or vanilla syrup, and seltzer (carbonated water)
*&quot;have a catch&quot;: to play a game of catch
*&quot;hero&quot;: a footlong sandwich or &quot;sub&quot;
*&quot;Mischief Night&quot;: the night before Halloween
*&quot;on line&quot;: Metro New Yorkers tend to say they stand &quot;&quot; line, whereas most other New York State and American English speakers tend to stand &quot;in&quot; line. 
*&quot;punchball&quot; and &quot;stickball&quot;: street variants of baseball, suitable for smaller urban areas, in which a fist or stick substitutes for the bat and a rubber ball (a &quot;Spaldeen&quot;) is used
*&quot;skel(l)&quot;: a vagrant, beggar, or small-time street criminal
*&quot;s(c)hmuck&quot;: an insulting term for an unlikeable man (from Yiddish &quot;shmok&quot;: &quot;penis&quot;)

The word &quot;&quot; tends to be used as a synonym for &quot;weak&quot;, &quot;someone unwilling or unable to defend himself&quot; or perhaps &quot;loser&quot;, though it appears to descend from an outdated New York African-American English meaning of &quot;male receptive participant in anal sex&quot;.

==Conversational styles==
New York City speakers have some unique conversational styles. Linguistics professor Deborah Tannen notes in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article it has &quot;an emphasis to involve the other person, rather than being considerate. It would be asking questions as a show of interest in the other person, whereas in other parts of [the] country, people don&#x27;t ask because it might put the person on the spot.&quot; Metro New Yorkers &quot;stand closer, talk louder, and leave shorter pauses between exchanges,&quot; Tannen said. &quot;I call it &#x27;cooperative overlap&#x27;. It&#x27;s a way of showing interest and enthusiasm, but it&#x27;s often mistaken for interrupting by people from elsewhere in the country.&quot; On the other hand, linguist William Labov demurs, &quot;there&#x27;s nothing known to linguists about &#x27;normal New York City conversation.

==Notable speakers==

The New York City accent has a strong presence in media; pioneer variationist sociolinguist William Labov describes it as the most recognizable variety of North American English. The following famous people are native New York City–area speakers—including some speakers of other varieties native to the region—that all demonstrate typical features of the New York City accent.

* Travis Bickle
* The Bowery Boys
* Archie and Edith Bunker
* Bugs Bunny
* &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; cast
* Terry Malloy
* Meowth from &quot;Pokémon&quot;
* Rhoda Morgenstern
* Linda Richman
* Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza from &quot;Seinfeld&quot;
* &quot;The Sopranos&quot; cast
* The Three Stooges
* Mona Lisa Vito from &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;
* Joey Wheeler from &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;

==Geographic boundaries==
The accent is not spoken in the rest of New York State beyond the immediate New York City metropolitan area. Specifically, the upper Hudson Valley mixes New York City and Western New England accent features, while Central and Western New York belong to the same dialect region as Great Lakes cities such as Chicago and Detroit, a dialect region known as the Inland North.

===New York State===
New York City English is confined to a geographically small but densely populated area of New York State including all five boroughs of New York City as well as many parts of Long Island; the dialect region spans all of Nassau County and some of Suffolk County. Moreover, the English of the Hudson Valley forms a continuum of speakers who exhibit more features of New York City English the closer they are to the city itself; some of the dialect&#x27;s features may be heard as far north as the state capital of Albany.

===Connecticut===
A small portion of southwestern Connecticut speaks a similar dialect, primarily speakers in Fairfield County and as far as New Haven County.

===New Jersey===

The northeastern quarter of New Jersey, prominently Hudson, Bergen, Union, and Essex Counties, including the municipalities of Weehawken, Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark, plus Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, are all within the New York metropolitan area and thus also home to the major features of New York City English. With the exception of New York City&#x27;s immediate neighbors like Jersey City and Newark, the New York metropolitan dialect as spoken in New Jersey is rhotic (or fully &quot;r&quot;-pronouncing) so that, whereas a Brooklynite might pronounce &quot;over there&quot; something like &quot;ovah theah/deah&quot; , an Elizabeth native might say &quot;over there/dare&quot; . &quot;The Atlas of North American English&quot; by William Labov et al. shows that the short-&quot;a&quot; pattern of New York City has diffused to many &quot;r&quot;-pronouncing communities in northern New Jersey, like Rutherford (Labov&#x27;s birthplace) and North Plainfield. However, in these communities, the function word constraint of the city&#x27;s short-&quot;a&quot; pattern is lost, and the open syllable constraint is used only variably.

====Notable speakers====
The following is a list of notable lifelong native speakers of the New York City English of northeastern New Jersey, regardless of their level of rhoticity:

* Jon Bon Jovi
* Chris Christie
* Danny DeVito
* Joey Diaz
* James Gandolfini
* Ed Harris
* Richard Kind
* William Labov
* Ray Liotta
* Joe Pesci
* Frank Sinatra
* Patti Stanger
* John Travolta
* Dick Vitale
* Zakk Wylde

<text>Aeronautical Engineers Australia (AEA) is an Australian aeronautical engineering consultancy and aircraft technical service provider. It is the largest civil aircraft design organisation in the Asia Pacific region and is now headquartered in Adelaide.

==History==
AEA was established by Graham Swannell in Perth in 1978 in order fill the gap in airworthiness people authorised to approve the design of modifications and repairs in Western Australia. Originally starting with a few desks in a part-owned hangar at Jandakot Airport, the practice grew and moved to its current location at 1 Eagle Drive in 1990. In 1995, the company established its second office at Parafield Airport in Adelaide to widen its client base and better serve existing customers in the Adelaide region. In 2000, AEA joined with HSJ aviation and founded its third office at Sydney&#x27;s Bankstown Airport. The company has since gone on to establish offices at Brisbane and Melbourne.

In 2003, a Cessna 404 crashed at Jandakot Airport. On investigation, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found a replacement bush used in one of the engine fuel pumps and approved by AEA had seized, causing the engine to fail shortly after takeoff. The pilot chose to turn the plane around to attempt a landing at the airport. However the plane’s speed fell below the best airspeed and it crashed in bushland. The pilot&#x27;s quick actions saved the lives of three passengers. The families and employer of the victims are suing the Civil Aviation Safety Authority though AEA, as many of the other companies involved have since ceased trading.

In 2010 AEA was bought by the Nova Defence Group to expand Nova&#x27;s business into the commercial sector.

==Services==
AEA provides a variety of services to the general aviation industry, including the design and certification of aircraft modifications, repairs and testing of aircraft components, aircraft weight control (aircraft reweighs, trimsheets and loading systems) in accordance with Civil Aviation Order 100.7 (CAO 100.7), design and manufacture of aircraft components (such as cargo nets, replacement parts, survey installations, equipment frames, skis, etc.) under a Production Certificate and Civil Aviation Safety Regulation Part 21 (CASR 21), flammability testing to FAR/JAR25.853 and similar provisions, systems integration, flight and performance testing, aircraft design, aeronautical consultancy, civil/military platform design etc.

Additionally Airline Technical Services was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of AEA to provide speciality services to the airline sector, and Swannell Racing now provides roll cage homologation services to the local racing industry.


==Major projects==
*CASA 212 Skiplane for Skytraders
*Fokker 50 Hardened Cockpit Door for Skywest and Alliance Airlines
*Dornier 328 Inflight Opening Door for AeroRescue
*Grumman G-73 Turbo Mallard Conversion for Paspaley Pearling
*Pilatus PC-12 Aeromedical Conversion for the Royal Flying Doctor Service
*Cessna 441 Life Extension Program for TAE

==Aircraft designs==
Since the 1980s, AEA has also been involved in the design of a number of whole aircraft projects including the Eagle 150B and the Explorer.

The Explorer is a high-performance but rugged utility aircraft that can perform a wide variety of roles at a lower cost than other equivalent aircraft. It was developed to cope with the harsh Australian conditions and unprepared dirt strips but still deliver a 180 kn cruise, almost 1000 nmi range and economical performance. The aircraft utilises the latest in aerofoil design, a carbon fibre fuselage shell, a unique retractable undercarriage, flat cabin floor, and a newly devised construction method that minimises construction and assembly time. The aircraft was initially developed as the 350R but now incorporates the 500T turbine variant and the stretched 750T.

AEA conceived, designed and developed the Explorer and started Explorer Aircraft Australia Pty Ltd to develop and market the family of aircraft. As the Explorer project grew, this role was passed onto Explorer Aircraft Inc. which is now located in Houston, Texas. To date, no funding has been received to continue the project to the development stage.

*Eagle Aircraft 150B---- (1997) Single-engine two-seat civil utility aircraft with conventional tailplane and canard surfaces. Composite construction

== Role ==
Under Civil Aviation Regulation 42U (CAR42U), any modification or repair that is carried out on an Australian aircraft must be done in accordance with &#x27;approved data&#x27;. This approved data is usually contained within the aircraft&#x27;s manuals (aircraft maintenance manual, structural repair manual, component maintenance manuals etc.) issued by the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturer. However, sometimes there is damage to the aircraft that is outside the scope of these manuals or the operator wishes to modify the aircraft to help it perform a specific function (aerial firefighting, search and rescue) or alter the aircraft in some other way. To ensure that the aircraft continues to be airworthy (i.e. safe to fly), the repair or modification must be examined by an aeronautical engineer so that the many complex factors that affect aircraft flight, structures and systems can be assessed and the design change approved as airworthy. To do this the engineer assesses the design of the modification or repair against the airworthiness requirements for the aircraft and then must justify that the design meets these requirements through the use of analysis, testing and experience. If the design has been shown to meet the airworthiness requirements it may be approved under Civil Aviation Regulation 35 (CAR35) and is hence &#x27;approved data&#x27;, satisfying CAR42U.

Provisions similar to CAR42U exist for how to and what to use when performing maintenance on an aircraft under CAR42V. If maintenance personnel wish to deviate from the aircraft&#x27;s approved maintenance data, the materials and procedures need to be approved under CAR36A.

AEA, along with other similar approved persons around Australia, is an approved design authority under CAR35 and CAR36 (for the approval of replacement components). AEA is also approved under the Papua New Guinea Civil Aviation Rules Part 146 which mirrors CAR35 for PNG registered (P2 registered) aircraft.

<text>Isicathamiya (, where the &quot;c&quot; represents a tenuis dental click) is a singing style that originated from the Zulu people, a South African ethnic group. In European understanding, a cappella is also used to describe this form of singing.

The word itself does not have a literal translation; it is derived from the Zulu verb , which means &#x27;walking softly&#x27;, or &#x27;tread carefully&#x27;. Isicathamiya contrasts with an earlier name for Zulu a cappella singing, mbube, meaning &#x27;lion&#x27;. The change in name marks a transition in the style of the music: traditionally, music described as mbube is sung loudly and powerfully, while isicathamiya focuses more on achieving a harmonious blend between the voices. The name also refers to the style&#x27;s tightly choreographed dance moves that keep the singers on their toes.

South African singing groups such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo demonstrate this style. Isicathamiya choirs are traditionally all male. Its roots reach back before the turn of the 20th century, when numerous men left the homelands to search for work in the cities. As many of the tribesmen became urbanized, the style was forgotten through much of the 20th century.

Today, isicathamiya competitions in Johannesburg and Durban take place on Saturday nights, with up to 30 choirs performing from 8 o&#x27;clock at night to 8 o&#x27;clock the following morning.

== Origin: traditional music, culture and spirituality ==

Although the style exponentially emerged in the 20th century, specifically in the 1920s and 1930s, many academics argue it can be traced back to the end of the 19th century. They believe the roots of isicathamiya are found in the American minstrels and ragtime US vaudeville troupes that toured South Africa extensively in 1860. Isicathamiya would have merged from a combination of minstrel inspired songs and Zulu traditional music.

Culturally and traditionally, isicathamiya is influenced by Zulu indigenous beliefs such as: belief in communalism which is expressed in the Zulu dictum, &quot;umuntu, ngumuntu, ngabantu&quot; , competition, strength and power associated with animals, reverence of the fireplace as a resource for food and warmth and, dreams for communicating with ancestors. The expression &quot;umuntu, ngumuntu, ngabantu&quot; which means &quot;a person is a person because of other people&quot;, dominates Zulu social organization and is used as a tool to strengthen social harmony. In the Zulu community, competition is highly valued, especially with music, as it is seen as a social issue which is subject to competition. It is also perceived as a public platform in which people can establish a concept of identity in a community. Isicathamiya performers improve their image by winning competitions. In Zulu folklore, bulls are a common symbol of power and masculinity. Other wild animals such as snakes, crocodiles, tigers and lions are expressions of power relations and assertion of power in competitive isicathamiya competitions. Early isicathamiya groups were named after animals such as Empangeni Home Tigers and Brave Lion Singers.

The fireplace is used metaphorically for the &quot;cooking of songs&quot; in isicathamiya stage performances. Emphasis is placed on the social organization based on the Zulu indigenous residence which took form in a circular bee-hive grass hut and at the center the head of surrounded by wives and children. The same formation takes places when isicathamiya songs were created with the leader in the center of the group. Dreams were an essential part of communicating with ancestors and formed part of a deeply rooted Zulu religious process. Some isicathamiya musicians claim some of their songs were created in the spiritual realm given to them by ancestors. Joseph Shabalala of Ladysmith Black Mambazo claimed he was inspired by dreams whereby, for six months in the 1960s, he was visited by voices. These were spiritual elders who were singing in the isicathamiya style. He experienced a final examination where each of the twenty-four elders asked him a musical question and Shabalala achieved a perfect score.

== Pre- and post-Ladysmith ==

In the 1980s, isicathamiya competitions were held in male hostels such as Glebeland, in Umlazi, one of townships in Durban. The groups were allowed to perform two songs adhering to the competition formation.

Joseph Shabalala formed Ladysmith Black Mambazo and had the opportunity to work with Paul Simon on the &quot;Graceland&quot; album which included two tracks, &quot;&quot;Homeless&quot; and &quot;Diamonds on Soles of her Shoes&quot;, which gained the group international recognition. The influence Joseph Shabalala had would change the context of isicathamiya in the late 20th century. Shabalala, Bongani Mthethwa and Paulos Msimango formed an organization called South African Traditional Music Association to help reclaim isicathamiya as a form of traditional music. Competitions were no longer in hostels but at the YMCA in Beatrice Street in the city center of Durban.

The change in venues allowed for variation in the basic theme of the competitions. A competition for the best dressed man was implemented and on occasion for the best dressed woman. Furthermore, all who registered to compete now paid a voluntary amount to the event conveners and the contribution of each group would be announced as they entered the hall.

Shabalala recognized the significance of his position on a global scale and would honor the community by conducting workshops for aspiring isicathamiya groups. Ladysmith Black Mambazo addressed pressing issues in South African in the 1990s such as HIV/AIDS, crime, violence and rape. The group would honor prominent members of South African society such as Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

The level of interaction the group uses with the audience has grown vastly. Shabalala communicated with the audience beyond the musical and dance aspects. There was a shift in language usage, no longer restricted to Zulu, Shabalala would recite the words to &quot;Homeless&quot;&quot; to teach the audience.

Shabalala continued to extend the boundaries of isicathamiya formalities by introducing Zulu &quot;maskanda&quot; (traditional musicians playing on European instruments, guitar and concertina) to open for Shabalala and his group.

== Competition etiquette and formalities ==

The core of isicathamiya were the all-night choir competitions that took place during the weekends in Johannesburg and Durban. Competitions were held all night long due to the number of choirs that would sign up at the start of the evening. Each choir had a group leader who was responsible for signing up the group and paying an entrance fee which would contribute to the monetary prize at the end of the evening.

=== Dress code ===

The isicathamiya groups dressed in suits, with white gloves, sparkling white shirts, shiny black shoes and red socks. The leader dressed in opposing colours from the group.

=== Formation ===

Before the group enters the stage, there would be a moment of pre-performance prayer with the group gathered in a circle praying for spiritual guidance. This circle formation is reminiscent of the cattle enclosure of a Zulu village, a sacred space where the men could feel the presence of their ancestors and pray to them.

The isicathamiya groups enter the stage for the competition and start with the group standing in a semicircle with the leader in front of the group. The group faces the judges and audience. Usually the first song is sung with the group standing still under the instruction of the leader in a &quot;makwaya&quot; (choral) setting. In the second half the group would incorporate leg dances or &quot;i-steps&quot; with their bodies synchronized to the rhythm of the song. At this point, the participants&#x27; girlfriends or wives would come up to support the group.

== Style and composition ==

The leader of the group is often the founder and the composer. Often the migrant workers are not educated in musical notation, however possess a different compositional technique. The founder of &quot;Ladysmith Black Mambazo&quot;, Joseph Shabalala, has said he composes when his body is sleeping and his spirit is at work. Typically the songs are written in response to what is troubling him at that moment. He strives to address troubling situations by composing a new song. These topics vary from love to politics and religious matters. The recurring theme is the social and political issues pertaining to life for black South Africans in KwaZulu-Natal, which burdened him greatly. Shabalala acknowledges the group used their music to educate the audiences they would encounter.

Shabalala shares how he learned to compose in the isicathamiya style; as it was through dreams where he heard voices from spiritual elders. This is common among Zulu traditionalists and isicathamiya composers.

Stylistically, isicathamiya is characterized by male voices performing a capella, with the SATB formation (one leading voice, a tenor, followed by one soprano (falsetto), one alto and the rest singing bass); however, in some cases there are recordings with banjo or piano as it was thought the instruments would appeal to the Black elite. A good isicathamiya performance includes call and response and multilayered vocal polyphony.

==Worldwide recognition==
The Western breakthrough for this style was Paul Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Graceland&quot; (1986), which featured such tracks as &quot;Homeless&quot; and &quot;Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes&quot;, in which Simon was backed by the haunting voices of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The group itself has since gone on to enjoy great popularity and recognition, including songs such as &quot;Hello My Baby&quot; and also recordings of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, the Rugby World Cup theme &quot;The World in Union&quot;, and &quot;Mbube&quot; (a song composed in 1939 by Zulu worker Solomon Linda – The song, with additional lyrics, is also known as &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;) — this last having given its name, meaning &quot; lion&quot;, to the genre. &quot;Mambazo&quot; members are also born again Christians and frequently demonstrate the close relationship between isicathamiya and gospel music in songs such as &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and various Zulu hymns. &quot;Mambazo&quot; is the primary &quot;a cappella&quot; group from South Africa to garner worldwide attention; all other widely known South African musicians use some form of instrumental backing, though some groups such as the Mahotella Queens, who sing against an electric guitar &quot;Mbaqanga&quot; melody, occasionally sing without instrumental backing.

<text>Access Television Network (ATN) was a company based in Coral Gables, Florida, that mainly carried paid programming for 300 cable television systems with a peak reach of 35 million households. It was generally broadcast by cable systems on existing channels during the early morning hours when no regular programming was scheduled, often overlaying that channel&#x27;s own block of paid programming. In late 2002, ATN expanded with the purchase of the Product Information Network (PIN), a similar 24-hour cable infomercial network. 

However, after incidents where ATN/PIN paid programming (often unknown to the customer where it was coming from) was laid over several NBA and NHL playoff games which went into multiple overtimes in the graveyard slot on their networks, earning heavy customer complaints to providers about the arrangement (along with networks such as Animal Planet beginning to carry a 24/7 schedule which would be pre-empted by the practice), networks cracked down on the practice of their own programming being overlaid by their carriage partners, and began to enforce their networks in future contracts as being carried as-is full-time, severely affecting the ATN/PIN business model. After that ATN began to be carried individually as its own channel on most systems, but was either completely ignored or immediately deleted by cable customers on their channel map who saw no original programming on its channel.

==History==
ATN was founded by William Bernard in 1993 in Irvine, California. It had over 200 shareholders which included a venture capital firm Spectrum Equity Investors and the Hearst Family Fund. ATN bought out Spectrum Equity with a loan through Wells Fargo Foothill. This loan was in turn purchased by Gladstone Capital who is the current largest debt holder of ATN.

In early 2012 ATN ceased operations as it could no longer generate sufficient revenues to pay its affiliates and satellite transponder obligations. George Henry filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy for Pacific Media Direct LLC on July 13, 2012.

<text>Elementals is an American superhero comic book first published in 1984 and created by Bill Willingham, for which he was both writer and artist.

== Publication history ==
The Elementals first appeared in the &quot;Justice Machine Annual&quot;, published by Texas Comics in 1983. The Elementals were supposed to become a bimonthly series, alternating with the Justice Machine, but Texas Comics folded after publishing the one comic. After Texas Comics folded, &quot;The Elementals&quot; were taken over by .

In a variety of specials and limited series, Comico published &quot;Elementals&quot; until 1996. Comico&#x27;s publisher, Andrew Rev, purchased the &quot;Elementals&quot; property from Willingham in the 1990s.

==Fictional setting and characters ==
When a centuries-old sorcerer named Lord Saker built a machine called the Shadowspear to harness the supernatural powers of the world, he upset the natural order of the universe. In response, the four elements, unimaginably powerful spirits who together formed the foundation of existence, each chose an ordinary human who had been killed by their element, and resurrected him or her. They granted each member control of that particular element, eternal youth, and the ability to heal from any wound (given sufficient time). The team consisted of:
* Morningstar, aka Jeanette Crane, a Los Angeles homicide detective who had burned to death while confronting a serial arsonist; she received various fire-related abilities, including pyrokinesis and an immunity to fire.
* Vortex, aka Jeff Murphy, a Coast Guard pilot and Vietnam veteran who was asphyxiated in a helicopter crash; he received various air-related abilities, including flight and wind-blasts.
* Fathom, aka Becky Golden, a flighty debutante who fell off a boat and drowned; she received various water-related abilities, as well as bright green skin and webbed fingers. She was also able to convert her body entirely into sentient water and shoot high-pressure streams.
* Monolith, aka Tommy Czuchra, a brilliant if introverted teenaged boy who was crushed to death by a landslide; he received the ability to become an enormous super-strong stone/earth golem. Later, Tommy came to follow Saker&#x27;s view that the supernatural beings were entitled to be in charge across earth, and he quit the Elementals and absorbed some of Saker&#x27;s &#x27;black&#x27; magic, to become one of his generals. Monolith was then re-embodied in a deceased insurance salesman (Donald Ridgeway), who neither wanted the power, nor ever understood fully how to use it or how to integrate with the other three Elementals.

The four eventually defeated Saker and his minions, the Destroyers, a team of six: Shapeshifter, Annihilator, Chrysalis, Behemoth, Ratman (who later changed sides), and Electrocutioner.

Shadowspear, once released from Saker&#x27;s control, formed a giant malevolent thunderstorm that circled the globe, occasionally transforming animals and corpses into monsters, thus keeping the Elementals busy for many years.

==Reception==
Martin A. Stever reviewed &quot;Elementals&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 83. Stever commented that &quot;Willingham&#x27;s imagination must be on overdrive to come up with some of the far out ideas in &quot;Elementals&quot;&quot;.

<text>The clerk of the Privy Council () is the professional head of the Public Service of Canada. As the deputy minister for the Privy Council Office (the prime minister&#x27;s department), the clerk is the senior civil servant in the Government of Canada and serves as the secretary to the Cabinet (). 

The role of the clerk is nonpartisan; clerks may serve multiple prime ministers and do not belong to any political party. As the secretary to the Cabinet, the role provides impartial advice to the ministry and oversees the advice and policy support given to Cabinet and its committees. As head of the public service, the clerk is responsible for other deputy ministers and the provision of non-partisan, expert advice to the government as a whole.

The clerk is a Governor-in-Council appointment made on the advice of the prime minister. On May 30, 2023, Prime Minister Trudeau announced that Janice Charette would retire on June 24, 2023, and that he would appoint John Hannaford to fill the position. 

In the provinces and territories, the equivalent position of senior public servant is called the cabinet secretary or clerk of the executive council (in French, or , respectively).

== History ==
The Privy Council for Canada was created and authorized by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, and there has been a clerk of the Privy Council since then.

The staff of the Privy Council increased from 142 to 352 between 1971 and 1975.

In 1989, reforms initiated by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney gave the clerk position its present day responsibilities. Expert Donald Savoie describes these as a combination of three roles: &quot;the secretary of cabinet, the head of the non-partisan public service, and the deputy minister — or top bureaucrat — to the prime minister.&quot; One critique of this arrangement is that it could put senior nonpartisan officials in the position of taking partisan positions. Clerks generally have extensive previous experience in the Public Service of Canada before being appointed.

<doc id="851336" wikidata="Q1382207" url="?curid=851336" title="Tomos">
<text>Tomos (, &quot;Motorcycle Factory Sežana&quot;) was a Slovene manufacturer of mopeds based in Koper. It was founded in 1948. Tomos acquired a production license from Puch to produce moped models under the Tomos name in 1954. Tomos had since produced various goods for the Eastern European market, including motorcycles, mopeds, outboard motors and Citroën cars for the home market.

Tomos mopeds were also produced in Epe, Netherlands since 1966. A very good-selling model was the Tomos &quot;4L&quot;, produced from 1969 until 1980. The Dutch development team was responsible for the introduction of models like the Colibri, Targa and Revival. Tomos was the last remaining moped factory in the Netherlands, surviving at least 36 others since 1966. Tomos mopeds were sold in the U.S. from 1976 to 2014 and also exported to Canada. In 2017 Tomos was also selling mopeds in the United Kingdom.

Tomos went bankrupt on January 3, 2019. After 1991 on all products there was &#x27;Made in Slovenia&#x27; label.

==History==
===Establishment===

After World War II, the Yugoslav government sought to develop new industries. A company to produce two-wheelers was established in Sežana in July 1954, and soon a license agreement was signed with the Austrian company Steyr-Daimler-Puch. Puch had economical and robust motorcycles suitable for gravel roads and steep terrain characteristic of the region, and Puch also offered favorable licensing terms and conditions, as it doubted that the factory would ever be able to operate independently. The very next month, the name TOMOS (TOvarna MOtornih koles Sežana) appeared in the company documents for the first time. In October 1954, the Yugoslav government started to build the Tomos factory in Koper, the seaside industrial center of Slovenia.
Production in temporary facilities started in 1955 and the factory was officially opened in 1959 by Josip Broz-Tito, the President of Yugoslavia.

In the 1980s bicycles made by the dutch company Sparta&quot; were sold by Tomos und its own brand.

Tomos remained a state-owned enterprise as Slovenia, with its close ties to Austria and Italy, was first to gain its independence as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up in the early 90s. The company navigated these challenges successfully and in 1998 it was privatized and sold to Hidria, a private Slovenian corporation.

===License production - motorcycles===

Tomos first product was a motorcycle called TOMOS Puch SG 250. In 1955 they made 137 of these motorcycles and assembled 124 RL 125 scooters and one hundred mopeds. The next year, mopeds accounted for the majority (1712) of the total number of assembled units, followed by motorcycles (615) and scooters. Simultaneously with the licensed production, Tomos started development of its own serial models.

In the late 1950s, numerous variants of the moped Puch MS 50 were produced under the common name Colibri. The first Colibris were marked VS 50; later marks ranged from 01 to 013. Individual variants were adapted to foreign markets. In 1959, they produced more than 17,000 Colibris and signed a contract for the first major export to Sweden. Among the most successful Colibris was the type 12, while its version Colibri T 12, which was first presented in 1961 became the most popular moped in Slovenia.

In early 1960s, market research showed that the interest in heavy motorcycles was decreasing all over Europe, and Tomos adapted its range of motorcycles and focused exclusively on the production of two-stroke 50cc motorcycles. In order to ensure systematic and organized development, the factory in 1962 organized own Technical and Economic Research department.

The 1960s were the most productive period for Tomos. The Netherlands emerged as an important market in 1960. Tomos had so much success, that the only other plant outside of Slovenia was built in the Netherlands in 1966. Until 2009 the factory produced for the Dutch market along with research and development of new units. Tomos became the longest surviving moped factory in The Netherlands until production ended in 2009 due to the fact production- and labor costs are lower in Slovenia. The Netherlands remains the strongest market for Tomos today.

===License production - automobiles===
Beginning in 1959, Tomos began producing Citroën automobiles under license at the Koper plant, and selling them in the Yugoslav market. The Yugoslav automobile market was closed, so this joint venture with a local firm allowed Citroën to access the market.
In 1972 Tomos, Iskra, and Citroën formed a new company, Cimos (Citroën, Iskra, Tomos), for the manufacture and export of cars and car sub-assemblies. Iskra was a manufacturer of automotive components, especially generators.

Cimos was half owned by Citroën and half by the Yugoslav government. The Yugoslav government was short of hard currency and often used the barter system, paying Citroën with cereals and raw materials, which Citroën resold in Western Europe.

Locally made vehicles included the Ami 8, 2CV6, GS, and Citroën Dyane (called the Diana). Cimos also sold imported vehicles, the CX and Méhari. The Cimos GS can be distinguished by round headlights, developed for the US market but never used there.

In 1981, Cimos began to produce a specific model, the Dak, an enclosed cargo utility vehicle, very similar to the fourgonette. The basis was an unstretched Diana chassis, unlike the French Acadiane which was based on the longer chassis of the 2CV AK400. Cimos also prepared a pick up truck from the same basis, the Geri. Sales were 2,200 Dak and 900 Geri. Citroën did not allow Cimos to export these utility vehicles, and this rift led to the French firm ceasing delivery of parts to its Yugoslav partner by 1985, dooming the joint venture.

===Own-design motorcycles - automatics===

At the brink of the 1970s, Tomos started preparing for the production of &quot;automatics&quot; of its own design, as the market was increasingly interested in such type of motorcycles and the components produced abroad were more and more expensive. Therefore, they produced Automatic A1 with improved single gear engine which was built into the framework structure of the previous Automatic. Its successor, Automatic A3 was made in 1973 when they launched the new, modernized production line with automated machines for framework welding. This was the beginning of the production of new frameworks in Tomos which were visually different from the licensed Puch&#x27;s motorcycle frameworks.

As the standard of living increased significantly in the 1970s, the number of young buyers also grew. These were attracted by automatics and mopeds of the type A-OS, A-ON and APN. The latter type was particularly popular among the young, which is why Tomos started producing special variants of these mopeds with raised handlebars, seat with back support, side bags and a lot of chrome.

In the 1970s, several new models of Colibris were sent to the markets. Colibris T-03, T-12 and T-13 had Puch&#x27;s motors while Colibri 14V had inbuilt motor produced by Tomos, according to its own design. After 1973 all motorcycles and bicycles with motors attached produced by Tomos were equipped with in-house manufactured engines. In this period, they also developed Colibri 15 with a stronger motor which could almost compete with motorcycles.

===Oil crisis and modernization ===
In the 1960s and 1970s Tomos&#x27; developmental activity reached its peak in terms of the volume of patents and prototypes. However, during the 1979–1980 time frame Tomos was faced with restrictive environmental standards for the first time. In the 1980s, Tomos modernized the entire range of two-wheelers and concentrated on reducing the level of noise and harmful emissions, and increased the rider&#x27;s comfort along with a more modern look.

1976 saw the debut of Tomos in the United States of America through US distributors. There were many European manufacturers who had mopeds in the USA market. The market hit its zenith in 1979 as gas prices were at a premium and shortages were common due to a change in OPEC policy. People started to rethink their consumption of gasoline and looked to more efficient means. The moped surfaced as that alternative reaching over 100 mpg.

The entire range of two-wheelers was again competing globally after the modernization in the 1980s. The first product from this new range was APN 6 which was introduced in 1981. In 1985, TOMOS launched a new generation of motorcycles, the BT 50 with cast wheels and turn signals. Based on this model, TOMOS ATX 50 C was produced later for off-road use.

===1990s===
In the 1990s Tomos came out with the Sprint, Targa, and Targa LX. The later two were eventually changed to TOMOS ST and TOMOS LX. A new engine was introduced called the A35. Tomos USA was started in Spartanburg, South Carolina, in a new office and warehouse complex of over .

===2000s===
In 2006 the A35 engine was replaced with the A55. This new engine featured lighter weight rotating parts as well as better power output. This engine is currently used on all 50cc applications.

In 2004, Slovenia was admitted into the European Union and a contract was signed with Germany&#x27;s BMW to produce component parts for some of its units, that production continues today from Koper. New models introduced during these years such as the MC Off-Road Line, Revival, Streetmate, and Arrow. Complementing these new units was a new family engine called the A55 in 2006, meeting stricter EPA emission standards.

===2010s===
Tomos returned to the US market with two new mopeds, the redesigned Sprint with classic details, and the all-new Racing TT, but went bankrupt in 2019.

==Outsourcing scare==
In November 2007, a statement was circulated which was interpreted to imply that Tomos&#x27; moped production would cease, as the company was no longer competitive against Chinese and Indian producers. The news caused a stir for several days in the Tomos moped community. However, a problem in translation had caused a misunderstanding, and the company later confirmed it was not ending sales, but instead outsourcing parts of the production.

<text>Stenonychosaurus (meaning &quot;narrow claw lizard&quot;) is a genus of troodontid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada, as well as possibly the Two Medicine Formation. The type and only species, S. inequalis, was named by Charles Mortram Sternberg in 1932, based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some caudal vertebrae from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta. &quot;S. inequalis&quot; was reassigned in 1987 by Phil Currie to the genus &quot;Troodon&quot;, which was reverted by the recognition of &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; as a separate genus from the possibly dubious &quot;Troodon&quot; in 2017 by Evans &quot;et al.&quot; and also later in the same year by Van der Reest and Currie.

==History of discovery==
The first specimens currently assigned to &quot;Troodon&quot; that were not teeth were both found by Sternberg in 1928, in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. The first was named &quot;Stenonychosaurus inequalis&quot; by Sternberg in 1932, based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some tail vertebrae. A remarkable feature of these remains was the enlarged claw on the second toe, which is now recognized as characteristic of early paravians. Sternberg initially classified &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; as a member of the family Coeluridae. The second, a partial lower jawbone, was described by Gilmore (1932) as a new species of lizard which he named &quot;Polyodontosaurus grandis&quot;. Later, in 1951, Sternberg recognized &quot;P. grandis&quot; as a possible synonym of &quot;Troodon&quot;, and speculated that since &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; had a &quot;very peculiar pes&quot; and &quot;Troodon&quot; &quot;equally unusual teeth&quot;, they may be closely related. No comparable specimens were available at that time to test the idea.

The holotype of &quot;Stenonychosaurus inequalis&quot;, CMN 8539, is a partial skeleton consisting of six caudal vertebrae, hand bones, the distal end of the left tibia and astragalus, and a complete left foot. A couple of cranial specimens were also referred to the genus: UALVP 52611 (a nearly complete skull roof) and TMP 1986.036.0457 (a partial braincase).

A more complete skeleton of &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; was described by Dale Russell in 1969 from the Dinosaur Park Formation, which eventually formed the scientific foundation for a famous life-sized sculpture of &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; accompanied by its fictional, humanoid descendant, the &quot;dinosauroid&quot;. 

&quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; became a well-known theropod in the 1980s, when the feet and braincase were described in more detail. Along with &quot;Saurornithoides&quot;, it formed the family Saurornithoididae. Based on differences in tooth structure, and the extremely fragmentary nature of the original &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; specimens, saurornithoidids were thought to be close relatives while &quot;Troodon&quot; was considered a dubious possible relative of the family. Phil Currie, reviewing the pertinent specimens in 1987, showed that supposed differences in tooth and jaw structure among troodontids and saurornithoidids were based on age and position of the tooth in the jaw, rather than a difference in species. He reclassified &quot;Stenonychosaurus inequalis&quot; as well as &quot;Polyodontosaurus grandis&quot; and &quot;Pectinodon bakkeri&quot; as junior synonyms of &quot;Troodon formosus&quot;. Currie also made Saurornithoididae a junior synonym of Troodontidae. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul went farther and included &quot;Saurornithoides mongoliensis&quot; in the genus &quot;Troodon&quot; as &quot;T. mongoliensis&quot;, but this reclassification, along with many other unilateral synonymizations of well known genera, was not adopted by other researchers. Currie&#x27;s classification of all North American troodontid material in the single species &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; became widely adopted by other paleontologists, and all of the specimens once called &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; were referred to as &quot;Troodon&quot; in the scientific literature through the early 21st century.

However, the concept that all Late Cretaceous North American troodontids belong to one species began to be questioned soon after Currie&#x27;s 1987 paper was published, including by Currie himself. Currie and colleagues (1990) noted that, while they believed the Judith River troodontids were all &quot;T. formosus&quot;, troodontid fossils from other formations, such as the Hell Creek Formation and Lance Formation, might belong to different species. In 1991, George Olshevsky assigned the Lance formation fossils, which had first been named &quot;Pectinodon bakkeri&quot; but later synonymized with &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; to the species &quot;Troodon bakkeri&quot;, and several other researchers (including Currie) reverted to keeping the Dinosaur Park Formation fossils separate as &quot;Troodon inequalis&quot;.

In 2011, Zanno and colleagues reviewed the convoluted history of troodontid classification in Late Cretaceous North America. They followed Longrich (2008) in treating &quot;Pectinodon bakkeri&quot; as a valid genus, and noted that it is likely the numerous Late Cretaceous specimens currently assigned to &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; almost certainly represent numerous new species, but that a more thorough review of the specimens is required. Because the holotype of &quot;T. formosus&quot; is a single tooth, this may render &quot;Troodon&quot; a nomen dubium.

In 2017, Evans and colleagues, building on the work of Zanno and others, confirmed the currently undiagnostic nature of the holotype of &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; and suggested that &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; be used for troodontid skeletal material from the Dinosaur Park Formation. Later in 2017, Van der Reest and Currie found &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; to be a valid genus, but reassigned much of the known material to the new genus &quot;Latenivenatrix&quot;.

Many Dinosaur Park troodontid specimens once referred to &quot;Troodon&quot; have recently been referred to &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; and &quot;Latenivenatrix&quot;. The specimens now referred to &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; include several frontals (UALVP 5282, TMP 1986.078.0040, TMP 1988.050.0088, TMP 1991.036.0690), a partial dentary (TMP 1982.019.0151), and the distal portion of a left metatarsal III (TMP 1998.068.0090). 

In 2021, a more comprehensive re-analysis of the morphology and stratigraphic positions of known skeletal material assigned to &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; and &quot;Latenivenatrix&quot; determined that several characters described as diagnostic of &quot;Latenivenatrix&quot; are in fact individually variable, that both taxa overlap stratigraphically, and that &quot;Latenivenatrix mcmasterae&quot; is a junior synonym of &quot;Stenonychosaurus inequalis&quot;. This leaves &quot;S. inequalis&quot; as the only valid troodontid taxon currently identified from the Dinosaur Park Formation.

===The &quot;Dinosauroid&quot;===
In 1982, Dale A. Russell, then curator of vertebrate fossils at the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa, conjectured a possible evolutionary path for &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot;, if it had not perished in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, suggesting that it could have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans. Over geologic time, Russell noted that there had been a steady increase in the encephalization quotient or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs. Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. Russell suggested that if the trend in &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure , comparable to that of a human (on average, for men and for women).

Troodontids had semi-manipulative fingers, able to grasp and hold objects to a certain degree, and binocular vision. Russell proposed that his &quot;Dinosauroid&quot;, like members of the troodontid family, would have had large eyes and three fingers on each hand, one of which would have been partially opposed. Russell also speculated that the &quot;Dinosauroid&quot; would have had a toothless beak. As with most modern reptiles (and birds), he conceived of its genitalia as internal. Russell speculated that it would have required a navel, as a placenta aids the development of a large brain case. However, it would not have possessed mammary glands, and would have fed its young, as some birds do, on regurgitated food. He speculated that its language would have sounded somewhat like bird song.

However, Russell&#x27;s thought experiment has been met with criticism from other paleontologists since the 1980s, many of whom point out that his Dinosauroid is overly anthropomorphic. Gregory S. Paul (1988) and Thomas R. Holtz, Jr., consider it &quot;suspiciously human&quot; and Darren Naish has argued that a large-brained, highly intelligent troodontid would retain a more standard theropod body plan, with a horizontal posture and long tail, and would probably manipulate objects with the snout and feet in the manner of a bird, rather than with human-like &quot;hands&quot;.

== Description ==

&quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; was a small dinosaur, up to in length and in body mass. The largest specimens are comparable in size to &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Unenlagia&quot;. They had very long, slender hind limbs, suggesting that these animals were able to run quickly. They had large, retractable, sickle-shaped claws on the second toes, which were raised off the ground when running.

Their eyes were very large (perhaps suggesting a partially nocturnal lifestyle), and slightly forward facing, giving &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; some degree of depth perception.
===Brain and inner ear===
&quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; had one of the largest known brains of any dinosaur, relative to its body mass (comparable to modern birds). This has been calculated as a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 31.5% to 63% of the way from a non-avian reptile proportion to a truly avian one. Additionally, it had bony cristae supporting their tympanic membranes, that were ossified at least in their top and bottom regions. The rest of the cristae were either cartilaginous or too delicate to be preserved. The metotic strut of &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; was enlarged from side-to-side, similar to &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; and primitive birds like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Hesperornis&quot;.

== Paleobiology ==
&quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; are thought to have been predators, a view supported by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good binocular vision.

&quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; teeth, however, are different from most other theropods. One comparative study of the feeding apparatus suggests that &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; could have been an omnivore. The jaws met in a broad, U-shaped symphysis similar to that of an iguana, a lizard species adapted to a plant-eating lifestyle. Additionally, the teeth of &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; bore large serrations, each of which is called a denticle. There are pits at the intersections of the denticles, and the points of the denticles point towards the tip, or apex, of each tooth. The teeth show wear facets on their sides. Holtz (1998) also noted that characteristics used to support a predatory habit for &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; – the grasping hands, large brain, and stereoscopic vision – are all characteristics shared with herbivorous or omnivorous primates and omnivorous &quot;Procyon&quot; (raccoon).

Age determination studies performed on the Two Medicine troodont using growth ring counts suggest that this dinosaur reached its adult size probably in 3–5 years.

A partial skeleton has been discovered with preserved puncture marks, possibly inflicted by a predator.

=== Reproduction ===

Dinosaur eggs and nests were discovered by John R. Horner in 1983 in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. Varriccho et al. (2002) have described eight of these nests found to date. These are all in the collection of the Museum of the Rockies and their accession numbers are MOR 246, 299, 393, 675, 676, 750, 963, 1139. Horner (1984) found isolated bones and partial skeletons of the hypsilophodont &quot;Orodromeus&quot; very near the nests in the same horizon and described the eggs as those of &quot;Orodromeus&quot;. Horner and Weishampel (1996) reexamined the embryos preserved in the eggs and determined that they were those of &quot;Troodon&quot;, not &quot;Orodromeus&quot;. Varricchio et al. (1997) made this determination with even more certainty when they described a partial skeleton of an adult &quot;Troodon&quot; (MOR 748) in contact with a clutch of at least five eggs (MOR 750), probably in a brooding position. Van der Reest and Currie considered it possible that the Two Medicine troodont was the same species as &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot;.

Varricchio et al. (1997) described the exact structure of the nests. They were built from sediments, they were dish shaped, about in internal diameter, and with a pronounced raised rim encircling the eggs. The more complete nests had between 16 (minimum number in MOR 246) and 24 (MOR 963) eggs. The eggs are shaped like elongated teardrops, with the more tapered ends pointed downwards and embedded about halfway in the sediment. The eggs are pitched at an angle so that, on average, the upper half is closer to the center of the nest. There is no evidence that plant matter was present in the nest.
Varricchio et al.(1997) were able to extract enough evidence from the nests to infer several characteristics of troodont reproductive biology. The results are that they appear to have had a type of reproduction that is intermediate between crocodiles and birds, as phylogeny would predict. The eggs are statistically grouped in pairs, which suggests that the animal had two functional oviducts, like crocodiles, rather than one, as in birds. Crocodiles lay many eggs that are small proportional to adult body size. Birds lay fewer, larger, eggs. The Two Medicine troodont was intermediate, laying an egg of about for a adult. This is 10 times larger than reptiles of the same mass, but two troodont eggs are roughly equivalent to the egg predicted for a bird.

Varricchio et al. also found evidence for iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid. MOR 363 was found with 22 empty (hatched) eggs, and the embryos found in the eggs of MOR 246 were in very similar states of development, implying that all of the young hatched approximately simultaneously. The embryos had an advanced degree of skeletal development and empty eggs were relatively uncrushed, implying that hatchlings were precocial. The authors estimated 45 to 65 total days of adult nest attendance for laying, brooding, and hatching. 

Varricchio et al. (2008) examined the bone histology of Two Medicine troodont specimen MOR 748 and found that it lacked the bone resorption patterns that would indicate it was an egg-laying female. They also measured the ratio of the total volume of eggs in clutches to the body mass of the adult. They graphed correlations between this ratio and the type of parenting strategies used by extant birds and crocodiles and found that the ratio in the troodont was consistent with that in birds where only the adult male broods the eggs. From this they concluded that troodont females likely did not brood eggs, that the males did, and this may be a character shared between maniraptoran dinosaurs and basal birds. However, a later analysis of avian clutch mass found that the type of parental care cannot be determined using conventional allometric methods such as the one used by Varricchio et al.

==Paleoecology==
&quot;Stenonychosaurus inequalis&quot; is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of southern Alberta, Canada, which at the time was a warm coastal floodplain covered by temperate forests. Apex predators included tyrannosaurids such as &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;. Herbivores included hadrosaurids such as &quot;Lambeosaurus&quot;, &quot;Corythosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Prosaurolophus&quot;; ceratopsids such as &quot;Styracosaurus&quot;, &quot;Centrosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Chasmosaurus&quot;; ankylosaurs such as &quot;Scolosaurus&quot;, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, and &quot;Edmontonia&quot;; and pachycephalosaurs such as &quot;Stegoceras&quot; and &quot;Foraminacephale&quot;.

<text>David Raziel (; 19 November 1910 – 20 May 1941) was a leader of the Zionist underground in British Mandatory Palestine and one of the founders of the Irgun.

During World War II, Irgun entered a truce with the British so they could collaborate in the fight against &quot;the Hebrew&#x27;s greatest enemy in the world – German Nazism&quot;. Raziel was released from prison after agreeing to work with the British. He was killed in action in Iraq in 1941.

==Biography==
David Rozenson (later Raziel) was born in Smarhon in the Russian Empire. In 1914, when he was three, his family immigrated to Ottoman Palestine, where his father taught at Tachkemoni, a religious school in Tel Aviv. During World War I, the family was exiled to Egypt by the Turks due to their Russian citizenship. They returned to Mandatory Palestine in 1923.

After graduation from Tachkemoni, he studied for several years at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav in Jerusalem. He was a regular study partner of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, son and ideological successor to the Rosh Yeshiva and Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook.

When the 1929 Hebron massacre broke out, he joined the Haganah in Jerusalem, where he was studying philosophy and mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

His sister, Esther Raziel-Naor, became a member of the Knesset for Herut, the party founded by Irgun leader Menachem Begin.

==Military career==
When the Irgun was established, Raziel was one of its first members. In 1937, he was appointed by the Irgun as the first Commander of the Jerusalem District and, a year later, Commander in Chief of the Irgun. His term as leader was marked by violence against Arabs, including a sequence of marketplace bombings. Some of those attacks were in response to Arab violence, although they did not target the specific perpetrators of this violence, as had been the case under the policy of Havlagah. Dozens of Arabs were killed in the attacks and hundreds more were maimed. Raziel worked in the Irgun with Avraham Stern, Hanoch Kalai, and Efraim Ilin. On 6 July 1938, 21 Arabs were killed and 52 wounded by a bomb in a Haifa market; on 25 July a second market bomb in Haifa killed at least 39 Arabs and injured 70; a bomb in Jaffa&#x27;s vegetable market on 26 August killed 24 Arabs and wounded 39. The attacks were condemned by the Jewish Agency.

On 19 May 1939, Raziel was captured by the British and sent to Acre Prison.

After the 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état, British called on assistance from the Irgun, after General Percival Wavell had Raziel, an Irgun commander, released from custody at Acre Prison. They asked him if he would undertake to kill or kidnap Amin al-Husseini, the Mufti, and destroy Iraq&#x27;s oil refineries. Raziel agreed on condition that he be allowed to kidnap the Mufti. On 17 May 1941, he was sent to Iraq with three of his comrades, including Ya&#x27;akov Meridor and Jacob Sika Aharoni, on behalf of the British army to help defeat the Rashid Ali al-Gaylani pro-Axis revolt in the Anglo-Iraqi War. On 20 May, a Luftwaffe plane strafed near Habbaniyah the car in which he was traveling, killing Raziel and a British officer Major Patrick .H. Freke Evans . Meridor returned to Palestine and took over command of the Irgun, while Jacob Sika Aharoni commanded missions that led to the British entry into Iraq and the saving of the Jewish community following the Farhud pogrom.

In 1955, Raziel&#x27;s remains were exhumed and transferred to Cyprus, and again in 1961 to Jerusalem&#x27;s Mount Herzl military cemetery.

==Commemoration==
Ramat Raziel, a moshav in the Judaean Mountains, is named after Raziel, as well as many streets in Israel bearing his name in commemoration. The Israel postal service issued a stamp in his honor. There is a high-school in Herzliya named after him.

<text>The Quickie Aircraft Corporation was founded in Mojave, California, in 1978 to market the Quickie homebuilt aircraft (models Quickie, Quickie Q2, and Quickie Q200 aircraft). The original single-seater Quickie was designed by Burt Rutan and company founders Gene Sheehan and Tom Jewett. The two-seater Q2 and Q200 were designed by Canadian Garry LeGare, Jewett and Sheehan. While the Q2 and Q200 were based on the original Quickie, the design was completely different. Now defunct, the company sold over 2,000 kits in its lifetime.

The Quickie&#x27;s canard wing used a GU25-5(11)8 airfoil, developed by Terence Nonweiler. It suffered performance degradation at low Reynolds numbers and in rainy conditions.

After losing a legal battle due to the crash of a home built aircraft, Quickie Quickie Aircraft Corporation - leaderless and fiscally strapped - went bankrupt in 1986

<text>Hi-Fi Serious is the third studio album by British alternative rock band A, released in 2002.

The name &quot;Hi-Fi Serious&quot; was derived from that of a fictional electronics store, from which Alan Partridge purchased a Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo system in the final episode of the first series of British sitcom, &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;. The tour in support of the album&#x27;s release was named the &quot;Inner City Sumo Tour&quot; – another nod to &quot;Partridge&quot;, this time referencing a line in the show&#x27;s very first episode.

==Charts, sales and legacy==
The album is certified Silver in the U.K., having sold over 60,000 copies.

First single, &quot;Nothing&quot;, made it to  9 in the UK singles chart before the album&#x27;s release, propelling the band higher up the ladder - the album peaked at No. 18 in the UK album charts - and although they were still not seen as a mainstream artist, the album still won them &quot;Best British Band&quot; at the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards.

In 2005, readers of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine voted &quot;Hi-Fi Serious&quot; the 57th best British rock album ever.

<text>The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (&quot;Blackhorse Regiment&quot;) is a unit of the United States Army garrisoned at the Fort Irwin National Training Center in California. The regiment has served in the Philippine–American War, the Pancho Villa Expedition, World War II, the Vietnam War, Gulf War and Iraq War. The 11th ACR serves as the opposing force (OPFOR) for the Army and Marine task forces, and foreign military forces that train at Fort Irwin.

The OPFOR trained U.S. Army forces in mechanized desert warfare following a Soviet-era style threat until June 2002, when the OPFOR and the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment changed to portraying an urban/asymmetrical warfare style of combat U.S. soldiers are facing in operations abroad. From June to December 2003, members of the 11th ACR deployed to Afghanistan, where they helped to develop and train the armor and mechanized infantry battalions of the Afghan National Army. These specialized units would defend the Afghan capital during the country&#x27;s constitutional convention. In January 2005, the 11th ACR deployed to Iraq. The 11th ACR was not reorganized under the U.S. Army Combat Arms Regimental System, though it has been reorganized under the U.S. Army Regimental System.

==History==

===11th Cavalry Regiment===
The regiment was constituted on 2 February 1901 in the Regular Army as the 11th Cavalry Regiment, and was organized on 11 March 1901 at Fort Myer, Virginia. The regiment participated in the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition under the command of William Jones Nicholson.

In 1919, the regiment was stationed at the Presidio of Monterey, California. On 15 July 1927, the regiment was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Division. It was relieved from the 3rd Cavalry Division on 1 May 1932 and assigned to the 2nd Cavalry Division. In April 1933, the regiment assumed command and control of the Monterey Civilian Conservation Corps District until mid-1934 and supported the construction and supervision of CCC camps in northern California from 1933 to 1939. It maintained habitual summer training relationships with the Organized Reserve 162nd Cavalry Brigade, 323rd Cavalry Regiment, and 162nd Machine Gun Squadron. The regiment moved to Fort Ord in stages from 16 to 27 January 1940 and again to Camp Clayton on 15 April to 15 May 1940 for temporary training. They participated in maneuvers at Fort Lewis in Washington from 4 to 29 August 1940, and returned to the Presidio of Monterey on 31 August 1940, where they were relieved from assignment to the 2nd Cavalry Division. They next moved to Camp Seeley in California on 7 November 1941, and again to Live Oaks, California, on 24 July 1941; they then returned to Camp Seeley on 17 September 1941, and to Camp Lockett on 10 December 1941.

They were next assigned to the Armored Force on 12 June 1942, and relocated to Fort Benning, Georgia on 10 July 1942, where they prepared to be inactivated and reorganized. The 11th Cavalry Regiment was inactivated on 15 July 1942 at Fort Benning, with personnel and equipment concurrently transferred to the 11th Armored Regiment, with concurrent development of the 11th Cavalry Group, and the 11th Tank Group. The remainder of the 11th Cavalry was disbanded on 26 October 1944.

====11th Armored Regiment====
The 11th Armored Regiment was constituted on 11 July 1942 in the Army of the United States, assigned to the 10th Armored Division (AD), and organized at Fort Benning on 15 July 1942 from the personnel and equipment of the 11th Cavalry Regiment. The motto on the unit insignia is &quot;Allons&quot;, which means &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; in French.

The regiment moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on 22 June 1943, and then Fort Gordon on 5 September 1943. 11th Armored Regiment was broken up on 20 September 1943, and its elements were distributed as follows:
* Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), 11th Armored Regiment, and 1st and 2nd Battalions were reorganized as the 11th Tank Battalion in the 10th AD.
* 3rd Battalion, 11th Armored Regiment was reorganized and redesignated as the 712th Tank Battalion, and relieved from assignment to the 10th AD. The 712th Tank Battalion was inactivated at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey, on 27 October 1945, and redesignated the 525th Medium Tank Battalion on 1 September 1948. It was activated on 10 September 1948 at Fort Lewis, Washington. The 525th Medium Tank Battalion was redesignated as the 95th Tank Battalion on 4 February 1950, assigned to 7th Armored Division, and activated at Camp Roberts in California on 24 November 1950, and inactivated there on 15 November 1953.
* Reconnaissance Company was reorganized and redesignated as Troop E, 90th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, which maintained a separate history thereafter.
* Maintenance and Service Companies were disbanded.

===11th Tank Battalion===
As part of the 10th Armored Division, the 11th Tank Battalion shipped out from the New York Port of Embarkation on 13 September 1944, and landed in France on 23 September 1944. The battalion participated in the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe Campaigns, and was located at Schongau, Bavaria, Germany on 14 August 1945. The battalion returned to the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation on 13 October 1945, was inactivated at Camp Patrick Henry in Virginia on the same day.

===11th Cavalry Group (Mechanized)===
Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Troop (HHT), 11th Cavalry Regiment was redesignated on 19 April 1943 as HHT, 11th Cavalry Group, and was activated at Camp Anza in California on 5 May 1943. At that time, the 36th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and 44th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron were attached. The group was then moved to Fort Bragg on 31 January 1944, and again to Atlantic Beach, Florida, on 15 March 1944 for amphibious training. They then moved to Camp Gordon on 1 June 1944 and then departed the New York Port of Embarkation on 29 September 1944, and arrived in England on 10 October 1944, and landed in France on 26 November 1944. They moved to the Netherlands on 8 December 1944, went into the line in Germany on 12 December 1944, and protected the Roer River sector; they recrossed into the Netherlands on 3 February 1945, and re-entered Germany on 27 February 1945 on the left flank of the U.S. 84th Infantry Division. The group then held a defensive line along the Rhine River near Düsseldorf on 12 March 1945 under the XIII Corps, and crossed the Rhine at Wesel on 1 April 1945, screened XIII Corps&#x27; northern flank, and saw action during the Battle of Munster and the seizure of the Ricklingen Bridge over the Leine River. During the campaign in northwestern Europe, Troop B of the 44th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron served as a mechanized escort and security force for the headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. In August 1945, 11th Cavalry Group headquarters was located at Gross Ilsede, Germany.

HHT, 11th Cavalry Group was converted and reorganized as HHT, 11th Constabulary Regiment on 1 May 1946. During this period, the regimental headquarters was located in Regensburg. As a constabulary unit, the 11th Constabulary Regiment patrolled occupied Germany and performed law enforcement and keeping of the public order missions. HHT 11th Constabulary Regiment was further reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment on 30 November 1948.

===11th Tank Group===
HHT, 11th Tank Group was constituted on 19 July 1943 in the National Army. It was activated at Camp Campbell in Kentucky on 28 July 1943 as a separate group. It was reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 11th Armored Group on 5 December 1943. During the war, armored groups such as the 11th were used as administrative headquarters for the numerous independent tank battalions fielded in the European Theater of Operations. HHC, 11th Armored Group was converted and redesignated HHT, 1st Constabulary Regiment on 1 May 1946. HHT, 1st Constabulary Regiment was inactivated on 20 September 1947 in Germany.

===11th Armored Cavalry Regiment===
Reassembly and organizing of 11th ACR was completed on 30 November 1948 by reconstitution and reorganization of elements of the 11th Cavalry Regiment and HHT, 1st Constabulary Regiment. HHT-1st Constabulary Regiment was converted, redesignated and consolidated into 11th ACR as HHT, 3rd Battalion, 11th ACR on 30 November 1948. 11th Tank Battalion was consolidated into 11th ACR on 8 January 1951. 95th Tank Battalion was consolidated into 3rd Battalion, 11th ACR on 1 October 1958. Air Troop inactivated 20 March 1972 in Vietnam; 2d Squadron inactivated 6 April 1972 in Vietnam; Air Troop and 2d Squadron activated 17 May 1972 in Germany. Around 1984, Air Troop was enlarged and became the 4th Squadron (&quot;Thunderhorse&quot;), also known as the Combat Aviation Squadron.

Placed 17 June 1986 under the United States Army Regimental System

Inactivated 15 October 1993 – 15 March 1994 in Germany

Activated 16 October 1994 (less 3d and 4th Squadrons; the Air Defense Artillery Battery; and the Howitzer Batteries, 1st and 2d Squadrons) at Fort Irwin, California

==West Germany (1957–64)==
As part of the Gyroscope unit rotations, the 11th ACR was sent to West Germany in March 1957 for another round at the border surveillance mission along the Iron Curtain, replacing the 6th Armored Cavalry Regiment. Regimental headquarters and 1st Squadron were located in Straubing while the 2nd Squadron was stationed in Landshut and the 3rd Squadron in Regensburg. The regiment&#x27;s border surveillance mission was along the German-Czech frontier. In 1964, the 11th ACR returned to the United States and would be bound for Vietnam within two years.

==South Vietnam (1966–72)==

Home now for the regiment was Fort Meade, where the &quot;Blackhorse&quot; engaged in operational training and support activities like participation in the Presidential Inauguration and support for ROTC summer training.

With the war in South Vietnam escalating, the Blackhorse Regiment was alerted for assignment to Southeast Asia on 11 March 1966. The regiment began specialized training for combat in a counterinsurgency environment. Modifications were made to the organization and equipment (MTOE) with emphasis on the use of modified M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs). Two M-60 machineguns with protective gun shield were mounted at the port and starboard rear of the vehicle, and a combination circular &amp; flat frontal gun shield(s) were added around the .50 caliber machine gun located at the commander&#x27;s hatch. This combination produced a M-113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle, or, in Vietnam more simply referred to as an &quot;ACAV&quot; by GIs, a name coined by 11th Armored Cavalrymen.

The regiment&#x27;s modifications emphasized the use of ACAVs instead of the &quot;Patton&quot; medium tank and completely replaced the M-114 found in reconnaissance platoons, which may have existed in European and CONUS areas of operation. The M114 had been deployed to Vietnam in 1962, but withdrawn in 1964 due to its unsatisfactory, and often disastrous performance. Throughout the war, the tank companies, with their M48 Patton tanks, remained the same in each squadron. In 1968, Colonel George S. Patton IV (son of World War II General Patton), commander of the 11th ACR in South Vietnam recommended to General Creighton Abrams that one squadron from a division and the other from theater command be issued the army&#x27;s new aluminum tanks (Sheridans) for combat testing. General Abrams concurred, and in January 1969, M551 Sheridans were issued to the 3rd Squadron 4th Armored Cavalry and the 1st Squadron 11th Armored Cavalry. Due to differences between the organization of regimental cavalry squadrons and divisional cavalry squadrons, in 1st Sqdn 11th ACR, the Sheridans were issued to the ACAV troops, replacing three M113 ACAVs in each platoon (the squadron&#x27;s one tank company remained intact); in 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry, the Sheridans replaced M48A3 tanks throughout.

Although the 3/4 Cavalry met near disaster with their Sheridans within a month of receiving them (one destroyed by a mine), the 1/11 Cavalry had just the reverse in luck, killing nearly 80 enemy soldiers during an engagement on 23 February 1969. All things considered, the army was satisfied with the Sheridan tank, and by the end of 1970 alone, well over 200 M551s would be in South Vietnam. While nearly all US armored cavalry squadrons were equipped with the M551 by 1970, the 11th ACR &quot;tank companies&quot;, as well as the three US Army armor battalions (&quot;1/69th, 2/34th, and 1/77th Armor&quot;) in country, all retained their 90mm gun M48A3 Patton tanks. Only the M48s, as well as the Australian Centurions, and ARVN M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks could effectively and safely conduct &quot;thunder runs&quot;; the firing of all tank weapons while driving down the highway or road. While ACAVs did not have a cannon, the Sheridan&#x27;s high recoil from its 152mm main gun negated it from firing excessive broadsides while moving down a road. Thus the most favored tanks for clearing highways with &quot;thunder runs&quot; on a daily basis, most often fell to the M48s of the 11th ACR and accompanying armor units.
===Arrival in country===
The Blackhorse Regiment arrived in Vũng Tàu, South Vietnam on 7 September 1966 and was commanded by Col. William W. Cobb. Operation Hickory (7–15 October 1966) produced the first enemy casualties inflicted by the 3rd Squadron and elements of the 919th Engineer Company in the vicinity of Phu Hoa.

===Blackhorse Base Camp===
Operation Atlanta was the code name for the establishment of Blackhorse Base Camp—the new home of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Vietnam. Blackhorse Base Camp was located approximately south of the village of Xuan Loc on Route 2 and approximately southeast of the village of Long Goia. Saigon is approximately to the west along Rt. 1. The operation began on 20 October and concluded on 3 November 1966.

Stanton&#x27;s Vietnam Order Of Battle lists the following locations for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment&#x27;s headquarters in Vietnam:

*Bien Hoa September 1966 – November 1966
*Long Binh December 1966 – February 1967
*Blackhorse Base Camp/Xuan Loc March 1967 – January 1969
*Lai Khê February 1969
*Long Giao March 1969 – September 1969
*Bien Hoa October 1969 – June 1970
*Di An July 1970 – March 1971

===Operation Cedar Falls===
From January until 18 May 1967, the regiment conducted three major search and destroy operations. These operations would later be known as reconnaissance in force (RIF) operations. The first of these operations commence on 8 January 1967 and was known as &quot;Operation Cedar Falls&quot;. It continued until 24 January 1967. The 1st and 2nd Squadrons operated in the infamous &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; region near Ben Cat employing search and destroy tactics, screening and blocking, and security in attacks on successive objectives.

===Operation Junction City===
Operation Junction City I and II involved the 1st and 3rd Squadrons. It began on 18 February 1967 and ran through 15 April 1967. This operation took these squadrons to the headquarters of the Central Office South Vietnam (COSVN) believed to be located in Bình Dương Province with the objective of destroying this important headquarters. This joint mission conducted with the 1st Australian Task Force secured lines of communication and fire support bases (FSB). Extensive RIF operations were conducted as well.

===Operation Manhattan===
Commencing on 23 April 1967 the third operation titled Operation Manhattan was a thrust into the Long Nguyen Secret Zone by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons. This zone was a long-suspected regional headquarters of the Viet Cong. In a series of reconnaissance in force operations 60 tunnel complexes were uncovered. 1884 fortifications were destroyed. 621 tons of rice was evacuated during these operations. Operation Manhattan ended on 11 May 1967.
===Operation Kittyhawk===
Beginning in April 1967 and running through 21 March 1968, the regiment was tasked to secure and pacify Long Khánh District. This year-long mission was called Operation Kittyhawk. It achieved three objectives: Viet Cong (VC) were kept from interfering with travel on the main roads, Vietnamese were provided medical treatment in civic action programs like MEDCAP and DENTCAP and finally, RIF operations were employed to keep the VC off balance, making it impossible for them to mount offensive operations.

===1967===
From the summer of 1967 until the winter the regiment was led by Col. Roy W. Farley. Operation Emporia I &amp; II was a road clearing operation with limited RIF missions by the 1st and 3rd Squadrons in Long Khánh District. Operation Valdosta I &amp; II was a regimental size operation. Its purpose was to provide security at polling places during elections and to maintain reaction forces to counter VC agitation. As a result of the operation 84.7% of eligible voters cast ballots in Long Khánh District in the first general election and 78% in the second.

===Operation Quicksilver===
Operation Quicksilver involved the 1st and 2nd Squadrons of the 11th Armored Cavalry. Its purpose was to secure routes that moved logistical personnel of the 101st Airborne Division between Binh Long and Tây Ninh Provinces. Cordon, search and RIF missions were also performed.

===Operation Fargo===
Operation Fargo ran from 21 December 1967 until 21 January 1968. This regimental size operation conducted RIFs in Binh Long and Tây Ninh Provinces and opened Route 13 to military traffic for the very first time.

===The Tet Offensive===
The early part of 1968 was marked by the most ambitious and embolden offensive attack coordinated by the VC and NVA in the history of the war. The Tet Offensive was designed to coincide with the Vietnamese New Year.

===Operation Adairsville===
Operation Adairsville began on 31 January 1968. Word was received by the II Field Force HQs to immediately re-deploy to the Long Binh/Bien Hoa area to relieve installations threatened by the Tet Offensive. At 1400 hours (2:00 pm) the 1st Squadron was called to move from their position south of the Michelin Rubber Plantation to the II Field Force headquarters. The 2nd Squadron moved from north of the plantation to III Corps POW Compound where enemy soldiers were sure to attempt to liberate the camp. The 3rd Squadron moved from An Lộc to III Corps Army, Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) headquarters. It took only 14 hours and 80 miles to arrive in position after first being alerted.

===Operation Alcorn Cove===
The security operation in the Long Binh/Bien Hoa area and the area around Blackhorse Base Camp by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons is continue under Operation Alcorn Cove which began on 22 March 1968. This combined mission with the ARVN 18th Division and 25th Division was a twofold operation of security and RIFs. Operation Toan Thang was an extension of &quot;Alcorn Cove&quot;. That combined operation involved the 1st and 25th Infantry Divisions.

From April 1968 to January 1969, the 11th Cavalry was commanded Colonel (later Major General) George S. Patton IV, the son of General George S. Patton Jr.

===&quot;Workhorse&quot; The 3rd Squadron===
K Troop was part of the 3rd Squadron and known as &quot;Killing K Troop&quot;. 3rd Squadron&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Workhorse&quot;. Shortly after its arrival in Vietnam, the 3rd Squadron engaged the Viet Cong for the first time. The squadron was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for this period.

The Tet Offensive of 1968 gave the squadron a chance to fight the enemy&#x27;s troop formations in open combat. In Bien Hoa the 3rd Squadron drove the enemy forces from the area near III Corps headquarters. Its action was crucial in smashing the enemy&#x27;s offensive.

On 20 October 2009 President Barack Obama presented a Presidential Unit Citation to troop commander Captain John B. Poindexter and all veterans of A Troop, 1st Squadron, 11th Cavalry for their heroism along the Cambodian border on 26 March 1970.

Brigadier General John Bahnsen, a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, served with the 11th ACR in Vietnam, commanding first the regiment&#x27;s Air Cavalry Troop, and later its 1st Squadron.

==Return to West Germany, Fulda Gap==
The 11th Cavalry Group Mechanized was redesignated as the 11th Constabulary Regiment on 3 May 1946 in order that the regiment could fulfill its occupation duties, and was restored as the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and inactivated in November 1948. Blackhorse was brought back into active status 1 April 1951 at Camp Carson, Colorado. In 1954, the regiment transferred to Fort Knox to complete its training in armored tactics.

The Blackhorse Regiment rotated to southern Germany in May 1957, relieving the 6th ACR, and assumed the mission of patrolling the German-Czechoslovak border until its return to the United States in 1964.

The Blackhorse arrived in Vietnam on 7 September 1966. Second Squadron spearheaded Operation Fish Hook into Cambodia on 1 May 1970, surrounding a North Vietnamese logistics center.

During the drawdown of U.S. forces in Vietnam in early 1972, the 11th ACR was inactivated in stages (Air Troop inactivated 20 March 1972 in Vietnam; 2d Squadron inactivated 6 April 1972 in Vietnam) and subsequently reactivated in Germany (Air Troop and 2d Squadron activated 17 May 1972 in Germany) by reflagging the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment. The unit, based at Downs Barracks, had the mission of patrolling the East-West German border at OP ALPHA. During the late 1980s the 11th&#x27;s 4th Squadron (Air) operated the first air assault school in Europe, known as the Blackhorse Air Assault School, based in Fulda.

After the Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991 the regiment ended its seventeen-year station along the Iron Curtain.

The Blackhorse Regiment deployed an aviation task force on 10 April 1991 to Turkey for Operation Provide Comfort, an operation to support the Kurdish relief effort. One month later, the three maneuver squadrons (1st, 2d and 3d) along with the regiment&#x27;s support squadron, deployed to Kuwait for Operation Positive Force, an operation to secure Kuwait so it could rebuild from the war. By October, the regiment had completed its missions in Turkey and Kuwait and returned to Fulda. As the need for US forces in Europe decreased, the Blackhorse Regiment was inactivated in a ceremony on 15 October 1993, and the remaining troops departed Germany in March 1994.

===Training the force===
Reactivated again on 16 October 1994, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment now serves as the Army&#x27;s Opposing Force at the National Training Center. The regiment portrays a determined opposing force that trains US forces in the basic principles of army operations and challenges all the battlefield operating systems. As the 2nd Brigade Tactical Group, the squadron trains brigade and battalion task forces during ten rotations a year at the National Training Center.

==Current organization==

===1st Squadron===
First Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry, &quot;Ironhorse&quot;, was activated as a horse squadron at Fort Myer in 1901. It has served in the Philippines, Mexico, Europe, and Vietnam. It is now organized as a combined arms battalion, and comprises one of the two maneuver elements of the 11th ACR. It is organized around a Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (HHT), and four line troops (two infantry, two armor), with a total authorized strength of 720 soldiers. It is equipped with the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle, an M901 ITV highly modified with an M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle turret to represent the BMP-2 armored personnel carrier, and the OSTV (OPFOR Surrogate Tank Vehicle) a vehicle based on the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle which can simulate a wide spectrum of threat tanks. Using this equipment and configuration, the squadron performs the first of its two primary missions, acting as a non-permissive opposing force (OPFOR) during ten FORSCOM combat training rotations each year. The squadron&#x27;s second mission is to deploy and fight as a combined arms battalion for various contingency operations throughout the world. In order to support this mission, the squadron must also maintain, operate and remain proficient on the M1A1 Abrams Tank and M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hennisse, the approximately 400 men of the squadron trained nine months before becoming the first squadron to leave for the regiment&#x27;s inaugural deployment, to the Philippines. Arriving in January 1902, Troops A and D patrolled Samar, where they fought the regiment&#x27;s first engagement.

In 1905, the regiment relocated to Fort Des Moines, Iowa. In 1906, the 1st Squadron remained in Des Moines while the rest of the regiment deployed to Cuba as part of President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Army of Pacification. In 1909, the 1st Squadron rejoined the rest of the regiment in Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia.

On 12 March 1916, the regiment received orders to join General John J. Pershing as part of the Mexican Punitive Expedition to pursue Pancho Villa. Nine days later, the 1st Squadron led the way, arriving in Mexico on 21 March. Later, the 1st Squadron rode 22 hours straight to the rescue of United States forces besieged in Parral.
The 11th ACR was not deployed during World War I. During this period, 1st Squadron conducted port operations in Newport News, Virginia. After the Armistice, the regiment, with its predominantly black horses, was stationed at the Presidio of Monterey, in California. The Army reorganizations for World War II eliminated the horse cavalry in 1940 and 1st Squadron traded in &quot;saddles and hooves&quot; for &quot;tracks and steel&quot;. The regiment was inactivated 15 July 1942. The personnel and equipment of the former 1st and 2nd Squadrons was combined to form the newly designated 11th Tank Battalion, which later fought at the Battle of the Bulge.

On 1 April 1951, the regiment was reactivated as the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, as part of the build-up for the Korean War. The regiment served in Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Knox in Kentucky, until deploying to Germany to replace the 6th ACR along the Czechoslovakian border.

In July 1964, 1st Squadron, along with the regiment, transferred to Fort Meade, Maryland. In 1966, the regiment deployed to Vietnam. The 1st Squadron earned the Valorous Unit Awards (twice), the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry (three times), and the Presidential Unit Citation. It was during the Vietnam War that the 11th ACR was granted authorization to wear its distinctive unit patch.

President Barack Obama awarded Alpha Troop of the 1st Squadron the Presidential Unit Citation on 20 October 2009, in recognition of a rescue mission 26 March 1970.

In February 1971, 1st Squadron was inactivated, then reactivated in May 1972, at Downs Barracks in Fulda, Germany.

During the Southwest Asia Campaign, Ironhorse operated Camp Colt, a scout training camp for reservists reporting to active duty. Following Desert Storm, the regiment deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Positive Force from June 1991 to September 1991. 1st Squadron, along with the rest of the regiment, was inactivated at Fulda in March 1994.

The 1/63rd Armored Regiment, Fort Irwin, California, was reflagged 1st Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in October 1994 with the mission of Opposing Forces for the National Training Center and continues to do so today.
On 30 January 2005, 1st Squadron left Fort Irwin for Iraq. After spending about three weeks in Kuwait, the squadron moved to Camp Taji on the outskirts of Baghdad. The squadron was assigned the task of patrolling the Adhamiyah sector of Baghdad, a suburb of Baghdad just north of Sadr City. The squadron was also assigned the task of training Iraqi Army units to ultimately take over control of the sector.

On 21 May 2005, the squadron left Camp Taji for Camp Liberty, one of the many camps that encircle Baghdad International Airport. Their new task was to patrol the Abu Ghraib sector just west of Baghdad and to provide perimeter security for Abu Ghraib prison.

While in the Abu Ghraib sector, 1/11 ACR participated in Operation Thunder Cat along with the 256th Infantry Brigade of the Louisiana Army National Guard. The operation focused on disrupting IED cells in and around the Abu Ghraib sector, west of Baghdad. During this operation, 1/11 ACR uncovered five separate weapons caches, detained four suspected insurgents and uncovered $2,200 in US currency.

The squadron redeployed to Fort Irwin on 22 January 2006 where it resumed its opposing forces mission for the National Training Center. During its deployment, the Nevada Army National Guard&#x27;s 1st Squadron, 221st Cavalry, the 11th&#x27;s former official roundout unit, took over the duty of OPFOR.

===2nd Squadron===
The 2nd Squadron is part of the Army&#x27;s Opposing Force at the National Training Center, conducting battle operations in accordance with published doctrine and combat instructions. While in its role as the 801st Brigade Tactical Group, the Eaglehorse Squadron portrays an opposing force (OPFOR) that trains US forces in the basic principles of combined arms maneuver (CAM) and wide area security (WAS). The regiment trains brigade and battalion task forces during ten rotations a year at the National Training Center, Ft. Irwin, California. Additionally between rotations, the squadron conducts realistic, live-fire based training at the platoon and Bradley crew level.

The 1st Battalion (Mechanized), 52d Infantry was inactivated on 26 October 1994 and the 2d Squadron was reactivated in its place by reflagging the existing unit. The 2d Squadron (&quot;Eaglehorse&quot;) was activated on 2 February 1901 at Fort Myer, Virginia, and its military campaign geographic areas include the Philippines, Mexico, Europe, Vietnam, and support in Southwest Asia. 2nd Squadron deployed with the regiment to the Philippines to suppress insurgent forces during November 1901. This deployment was commemorated by the bolos becoming part of the Blackhorse crest. The Blackhorse Regiment settled in Fort Des Moines in Iowa in 1905.

The 2nd Squadron deployed to Cuba, 16 October 1906, as part of President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Army of Pacification. Their mission was to patrol and be a show of force. Eaglehorse joined with the General J. Pershing Pancho Villa Expedition in a punitive action against Mexico, with orders to pursue Pancho Villa, on 12 March 1916. Major Robert L. Howze, Commander, 2nd Squadron, led the &quot;last mounted charge&quot; on 5 May 1916, placing the Eaglehorse Squadron action as a milestone in military history.

The Blackhorse Regiment patrolled the U.S.-Mexican border from 1919 through 1942. The regiment received the name &quot;Blackhorse&quot; and a distinctive coat of arms while stationed at the Presidio of Monterey.

====World War II====
The regiment inactivated as a &quot;horse regiment&quot; on 15 July 1942 at Fort Benning in Georgia. The Headquarters and Headquarters Troop was redesignated on 19 April 1943 as the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 11th Cavalry Group Mechanized. The former squadrons of the 11th Cavalry were sent to fight with the 10th Armored Division and the 90th Infantry Division overseas. The new HHT, 11th Cavalry Group Mechanized drew new squadrons, the 36th and 44th, and also received an Assault Gun Troop (Howitzer Battery).

After guarding the US southeastern coast from March 1944 until 1 June 1944, the group moved to Camp Gordon, Georgia, to begin training for overseas deployment, The regiment arrived in the United Kingdom on 10 October 1944. The regiment entered France on 23 November 1944. Moving through France and Germany, the Blackhorse was assigned to the Ninth US Army and attached to XIII Corps, whose flank the Blackhorse screened during the corps&#x27; sweep from the Roer to the Rhine.

===3rd Squadron===
Post-Vietnam, the 3rd Squadron (&quot;Workhorse&quot;) was based at McPheeters Barracks in Bad Hersfeld, Germany, about 40 kilometers north of Fulda. The 3rd Squadron was organized as an armored cavalry squadron like the 1st and 2nd Squadrons. HHT and I, K, and L Troops, Howitzer Battery, as well as M Company were organic to the squadron. Attached was the 58th Engineer Company. Bravo Battery, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery was also headquartered with the squadron. In the field, the attached units of the regiment like the 58th Engineer Company usually operated over a wide area, with smaller detachments dedicated to supporting the armored cavalry squadrons of the regiment.

===4th Squadron===
The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) arrived in Viet Nam in September 1966, the Air Cavalry Troop (ACT), organic to the regiment, arrived in December of the same year with a complement of UH-1C Gunships and UH-1D Command and Control &quot;slicks&quot;. Early in January 1967, ACT was flying combat support for the regiment&#x27;s missions. It was after this time that ACT earned its nickname &quot;Thunderhorse&quot; because of the distinctive roaring sound of rotorwash over the rice paddies and the unit&#x27;s distinctive Blackhorse insignia. 
In July 1968, Air Cavalry Troop was reorganized into Air Troop (AT), consisting of nine AH-1G Cobra gunships, designated &quot;reds&quot; and nine OH-6 light observation helicopters (LOH), designated &quot;whites&quot;, which flew in pairs as target acquisition and destroy missions as &quot;pinks&quot; and an aerial rifle platoon (ARP) &quot;Blues&quot; with infantry/cavalry scouts transported in the venerable UH-1 &quot;Huey&quot; (officially designated Iroquois). 
Air Troop served with distinction, earning the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm &quot;VIETNAM 24 February – 19 May 1971&quot; (DAGO 42, 1972) and the 1st platoon of AT earned the Presidential Unit Citation &quot;DUC HOA 12 Mar – 1 Apr 1969&quot; (DAGO 69, 1969) in addition to the regiment&#x27;s awards and streamers. In 1969, a Trooper from Air Troop, SFC Rodney J. T. Yano posthumously earned the Medal of Honor.

The aviation assets of the regiment were deactivated on 20 March 1972 and left Viet Nam. The regiment was reactivated on 17 May 1972 to replace the inactivated 14th ACR and on 18 September 1972, the newly formed Command and Control Squadron was formed at Sickles Army Airfield near Fulda. The regiment&#x27;s new C&amp;C Squadron was given the task of providing aerial surveillance of the 385-kilometer &quot;iron curtain&quot;, which separated East and West Germany. C&amp;C Squadron consisted of its headquarters elements, as well as Air Troop (AT/AHT) with its 3 UH-1H, 21 AH-1S(MOD) and 13 OH-58A. Combat Aviation/Support Troop (CAT/ST AIR), with its 13 UH-1H, including an Aerial Mine Platoon (AMP) and 6 OH-58A, 58th Combat Engineer Company (CEC). The 340th Army Security Agency (ASA) and the 84th Army Band. A detachment of two each OH-58A were assigned to the 2nd Squadron at Bad Kissingen and the 3rd Squadron at Bad Hersfeld. 
In 1981, Air Troop, under the command of Major Joseph W. Sutton, won the Draper Cavalry Award; it was the first time an aviation unit had won the award. Later, under the command of Major Michael K. Mehaffey, Air Troop was recognized as the Army Aviation Association of America&#x27;s (AAAA) Unit of the Year. 
On 1 June 1982, Command and Control Squadron was redesignated as Regimental Combat Aviation Squadron (RCAS) and officially as the Combat Aviation Squadron (provisional), 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and nicknamed &quot;Lighthorse&quot;.

In the spring of 1984, Air Troop was once again named AAAA Aviation Unit of the Year. On 14 June of the same year, under the guidance of the Department of the Army&#x27;s &quot;Cavalry 86&quot; and the new &quot; J-series&quot; Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE), elements of AT and CAT were combined to form the new 11th Combat Aviation Squadron (11th CAS), named &quot;Thunderhorse&quot; to honor the history of those Air Cavalry Troopers who had served before. The new squadron consisted of a Headquarters, and a Headquarters Troop, to include an Aircraft Maintenance Platoon (AVUM), designated &quot;Crazyhorse&quot;; Alpha Troop which was assigned a combat support aviation role, was the last Aerial Mine Platoon in the Army. It used a Yosemite Sam, clad in a cavalry uniform for its mascot and was called the &quot;Miners&quot;; Bravo Troop, an Attack Helicopter Troop used the old cobra logo from AT and later a bull dog; Charlie Troop, called &quot;Tankbusters&quot;, an attack helicopter troop used the silhouette of a Soviet T-62 in an AH-1 turret gun site; Delta Troop an air cavalry troop was known as the &quot;Death Riders&quot; and used a &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; type skull on a red and white background: Echo Troop, an air cavalry troop used a red and white logo which included a large letter E an AH-1 and OH-58 profile; F Troop, an air cavalry troop used a cartoon figure of an AH-1 punching a Soviet MI-24(HIND) with the motto &quot;Grab &#x27;em by the nose – kick &#x27;em in the ass&quot; and the 511th Military Intelligence Company (MI/CEWI) &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; which had replaced the 340th ASA. In 1984, three EH-1H were assigned to the 511th. The squadron&#x27;s S-4 section was known as &quot;Hobbyhorse&quot;.

On 17 Jun 1986 the squadron aligned itself in accordance with the US Army Regimental System (USARS). Now flying UH-60&#x27;s, OH-58C&#x27;s and AH-1F&#x27;s, the squadron eventually ended up as HHT, N, O, P, Q, R S and AVUM Troops. On 9 November 1989 the wall fell and by the first of March 1990, the squadron ceased border operations.
Early on 10 April 1991 elements of the squadron were issued no notice deployment orders to self-deploy from Fulda to Diyarbakır, Turkey in support of Operation Provide Comfort. Task Force Thunderhorse deployed 15 UH-60 and five OH-58D along with crews and support personnel. 
During this period the 511th MI (CEWI) was recognized as the best company sized military intelligence unit in the Army. With the fall of the wall, and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the regiment on 15 October 1993 to 15 March 1994 began the deactivation process of the unit.
The regiment, less the 3rd and 4th Squadrons, was reactivated in October 1994 at Fort Irwin California.

===Support Squadron (&quot;Packhorse&quot;)===
Support Squadron, 11th ACR provides combat support/combat service support to the 11th ACR and NTC Opposing Force and conducts deployment, survivability and MOS sustainment training IOT ensure the success of the regiment, OPFOR, and squadron.

&quot;Packhorse&quot;, was activated in Germany under the command of LTC Ronald Kelly on 17 September 1985 to support the Blackhorse as it patrolled the East-West German border along the Fulda Gap. The squadron&#x27;s official name at that time was Combat Support Squadron (CSS). The nickname &quot;Packhorse&quot; is derived from the early days of the U.S. Cavalry, when soldiers went on campaigns accompanied by packhorses, additional horses and/or mules that carried all their essential supplies. Everything from food to gunpowder to horseshoes were transported in this manner.

Initial organization included five units—Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, Maintenance Troop, Supply and Transportation Troop, Medical Troop, and the attached 54th Chemical Detachment. The squadron also operated the Regimental Material Management Center which had the responsibility for the overall logistics state of the regiment. Elements of the squadron were initially based at both Fulda and Wildflecken Training Area until S&amp;T Troop relocated to Fulda in spring 1990. The squadron was large for a battalion-sized unit, as the Maintenance Troop alone had some 400 soldiers assigned. The Packhorse provided logistical support during both the frequent regimental maneuvers of the Cold War and at gunnery exercises at Grafenwoehr, where the squadron operated for weeks at a time while the cavalry troops and tank companies rotated through the firing ranges.

Squadron vehicles during the Cold War included 3/4-ton M1009 CUCV&#x27;s, 1&amp;1/4-ton M1008 and M1010 pickup trucks that often carried special-purpose shelters mounting communications, medical, or maintenance equipment, HEMTT&#x27;s, M88&#x27;s, tanker trucks, and trucks carrying chemical decontamination equipment. A pair of M934 5-ton Expansible Vans (&quot;Expando-vans&quot;) housed the squadron headquarters in the field. The Supply &amp; Transport Troop was a 215-man element consisting of five platoon units - HQ Platoon, Supply Platoon (An Ammunition CL V Section, a Supply Section CL II/IV, and Water purification Section), Transportation Platoon (6 HETTs, 20 ea 5-Ton Cargo Trucks, 20 ea Stake and Platform (S&amp;T) Trucks each with two trailers, POL Platoon (22 ea, 5000 Gal Fuel Tankers), and an Organic Maintenance Platoon. The squadron was also capable of highly specialized functions such as the provision of potable water by filtering fresh water sources through purification units.

On 3 October 1990, the two Germanys re-unified. By December 1991 the Soviet Union dissolved, ending squadron&#x27;s six-year presence along the Iron Curtain. In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, prompting the United States to respond. On 16 May 1991, the Packhorse received orders to deploy to Kuwait to support the regiment as it secured the country while it struggled to rebuild after the war. By October, the regiment had completed its mission and the Packhorse returned to Fulda. As the need for U.S. forces in Europe decreased, the Packhorse was inactivated on 15 February 1994, followed by the Blackhorse on 15 March 1994.

The 177th Forward Support Battalion was inactivated on 26 October 1994, becoming the Regimental Support Squadron, &#x27;Packhorse&#x27; now carrying its new role with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Opposing Forces at the National Training Center.
One unit that did not convert, was the 164th Chemical Company. Due to its pending inactivation in the spring of 1995, leaving only two platoons then being assigned to HHT, RSS.

The Service and Recovery section has a continuous mission of providing recovery to disabled vehicles for the post.

<doc id="851386" wikidata="Q5552481" url="?curid=851386" title="Gerovital">
<text>Gerovital H3 (or procaine hydrochloride and products known as GH3 and other variants, which may or may not be identical to Gerovital H3) is a preparation developed during the 1950s and promoted by its advocates as an effective anti-aging treatment. In the United States, the FDA bans Gerovital H3 from interstate commerce as an unapproved drug and, since 1982, has prohibited its importation.

Gerovital is promoted with unsupported claims of its curative abilities for a wide range of human ailments; research has found no evidence that it has any health benefit or &quot;anti-aging&quot; properties.

==Development and marketing==
The impetus for developing the drug is sometimes alleged to have come from Nicolae Ceaușescu, who is also wrongly claimed to have funded the establishment of a research organization - the National Institute of Geriatrics, in Bucharest, Romania, headed by Ana Aslan (1897–1988).

From the 1950s until her death in 1988, Aslan promoted Gerovital H3 with great success. In the 1960s and 1970s her Romanian clinic, the Parhon Institute, became a mecca for celebrities seeking treatment, and an upscale tourist attraction. &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to Gerovital&#x27;s &quot;jet-set aura&quot;, noting that Aslan had been covered in &quot;society columns where such public figures as Nikita S. Khrushchev, Konrad Adenauer, and Ibn Saud have been listed among the multitudes said to have taken the drug.&quot; As late as 1988, an advertisement by the Romanian National Tourist Office lauded &quot;the picturesque and exciting cities, scenic delights, famous resorts (including Gerovital H3 treatment centers), cultural and historic treasures that await the traveler to Romania.&quot;

With the rise of the Web Gerovital has enjoyed a new lease of promotional life as it is promoted by many sites with claims of its &quot;cure-all&quot; abilities.

==Denouncement==
A 1973 &quot;New York Times&quot; article said &quot;cold water was thrown on [Gerovital]&#x27;s reputation years ago&quot; by &quot;three reports published simultaneously in British Medical Journal [that said it] found no merit for procaine hydrochloride for any of the problems of aging.&quot;

Some clinical trials in the mid-to-late 1970s suggested that Gerovital H3 acts as a weak, competitive, reversible MAO inhibitor, and so may have some antidepressant value, but otherwise has a negligible effect on disease. In 1994, the U.S. FDA Consumer magazine said: &quot;No health claims for Gerovital have been substantiated, and FDA considers it an unapproved new drug. It has caused low blood pressure, respiratory difficulties, and convulsions in some users.&quot; Suppliers assert that the product is safe, and one cites a brief quotation from a newspaper article that says &quot;while as early as 1973 Elmer Gardner of the FDA&#x27;s Bureau of Drugs stated &#x27;There is no safety problem with Gerovital H-3.

==Effectiveness==
There is no evidence that Gerovital is helpful in slowing aging or treating illness.

==Drug or nutrient?==
Procaine itself is often considered to be a drug. Earlier references by advocates of Gerovital H3 refer to it as a drug. Hoffer and Walker (1980) call it a &quot;youth drug&quot;. Mircea Dumitru, Aslan&#x27;s colleague and personal physician, describes it as &quot;a complex drug acting like the procaine molecule. The addition of benzoic acid, potassium and disodium phosphate increase the effects of Gerovital-H3 biotrophic treatment.&quot;

==FDA ban==
, the FDA&#x27;s 1982 automatic detention alert is still in effect and bans the import of Gerovital H3 into the U.S. as &quot;a new drug within the meaning of 201(p), without an approved new drug application [Unapproved New Drug, Section 505(a)].&quot;

The ban covers:
* Gerovital, GH3, KH3, Zell H3, GH3 etc. This order was rescinded for GEROVITAL Cosmetics Lines, not containing procaine.
* Finished injectable or oral Procaine Hydrochloride

<text>Malcolm Kenneth Gordon (January 10, 1868 – November 13, 1964) was an ice hockey coach at St. Paul&#x27;s School from 1888 to 1917.

Gordon was born in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1882, he arrived at St. Paul&#x27;s in Concord, New Hampshire.

Hockey had been earlier introduced at St. Paul&#x27;s from Canada, but Gordon is regarded as the individual who helped formalize the game by putting down on paper what is regarded as the first set of rules in the United States. This occurred in 1885; in 1888 he was made hockey coach. Play at St. Paul&#x27;s was strictly intramural, but in 1896 Gordon took the first St. Paul&#x27;s team to New York City to play at the old St. Nicholas Rink. In that first game the St. Paul&#x27;s alumni defeated Gordon&#x27;s team 3-1.

His coaching career extended until 1917, during which time he developed numerous players, including Hobey Baker, for the Eastern colleges. It was such former players who provided the financial backing for the St. Nicholas Rink. Gordon was head of the history department at St. Paul&#x27;s and in addition to hockey, also coached football and cricket as well.

After World War I service he was in the real estate business until 1927, when he founded the Malcolm K. Gordon School at Garrison, New York. He retired as headmaster in 1952, succeeded by his son David. Gordon continued to teach history at the school until 1963. He died the following year in Garrison, New York, at age 96.

In 1973, he was inducted in the first class (1973) to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.

<doc id="851410" wikidata="Q205408" url="?curid=851410" title="SELENE">
<text>SELENE (; Selenological and Engineering Explorer), better known in Japan by its nickname , was the second Japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft following the Hiten probe. Produced by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA), the spacecraft was launched on September 14, 2007. After orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill on June 10, 2009.

==Nickname==

The orbiter&#x27;s nickname, Kaguya, was selected by the general public. It comes from the name of a lunar princess in the ancient Japanese folktale &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;. After their successful release, its sub-satellites, Rstar and Vstar, were named Okina and Ouna, also derived from characters in the tale.

==Mission objectives==
The main scientific objectives of the mission were to:
* Study the origins of the Moon and its geologic evolution
* Obtain information about the lunar surface environment

==Launch==

SELENE launched on September 14, 2007, at 01:31:01 UTC on an H-IIA (Model H2A2022) carrier rocket from Tanegashima Space Center into a (perigee) / (apogee) geocentric parking orbit. The total launch mass was .

The SELENE mission was originally scheduled to launch in 2003, but rocket failures on another mission and technical difficulties delayed the launch until 2007. Launch was planned for August 16, 2007, but was postponed when some electronic components were found to be installed incorrectly.

==Lunar operations==
On October 3, it entered an initial polar lunar orbit.
On October 9, the relay satellite was released into a orbit, while on October 12 the VLBI satellite was released into a one. Finally, by October 19, the orbiter was in a circular orbit. The nominal mission duration was one year plus possible extensions.

On October 31, 2007, Kaguya deployed its Lunar Magnetometer, Lunar Radar Sounder, Earth-looking Upper Atmosphere and Plasma Imager. On December 21, 2007, Kaguya began regular operations after all fifteen observation experiments had been satisfactorily verified.

Kaguya completed the planned operation by the end of October 2008 and began extended operations planned to continue through March 2009. It would then be sent into a circular orbit, and finally to an elliptical one, with a controlled impact occurring by August 2009. Because of a degraded reaction wheel, the plan was changed so that on February 1, 2009, the orbit was lowered to ± ,
and impact with lunar surface occurred at 18:25 UTC on June 10, 2009.

==Design==
The mission featured three separate spacecraft:

===Main orbiter===

*Shape: octagonal prism
*Mass: 
*Size: 2.1 x 2.1 x 4.8 m (6.9 x 6.9 x 16 ft)
*Attitude control: Three-axis stabilized
*Power: 3.5 kW (Max.)
*Mission period: 1 year
*Mission orbit: Circular, 
*Inclination: 90 degrees

===Okina (small relay satellite)===
Okina (formerly Rstar) and Ouna (formerly Vstar) were octagonal prisms to support radio science. Okina relayed radio communications between the orbiter and the Earth when the orbiter was behind the Moon. This allowed, for the first time, the direct Doppler shift measurements needed
to precisely map the gravitational field of the lunar farside; previously, the farside gravity field could only be inferred by nearside measurements. The relay satellite impacted the lunar farside near the Mineur D crater at 19:46 JST (10:46 UTC) on February 12, 2009.

*Function: two-way radio science relay, orbiter-earth
*Mass: 
*Size: 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.65 m (3.3 x 3.3 x 2.1 ft)
*Attitude control: spin-stabilized
*Power: 70 W
*Initial orbit: 
*Inclination: 90 degrees

===Ouna (VLBI satellite)===
Ouna used Very Long Baseline Interferometry as a second way to map the Moon&#x27;s gravity field. It was especially useful at the lunar limb, where the gravitational acceleration is perpendicular to the line of sight to Earth, making Doppler measurements unsuitable.

*Function: VLBI radio science
*Mass: 
*Size: 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.65 m (3.3 x 3.3 x 2.1 ft)
*Attitude control: spin-stabilized
*Power: 70 W
*Initial orbit: 
*Inclination: 90 degrees

==Instruments==
SELENE carried 13 scientific instruments &quot;to obtain scientific data of the lunar origin and evolution and to develop the technology for the future lunar exploration&quot;:

*Terrain camera (TC) (resolution 10 meters [33 ft] per pixel)
*X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRS)
*Lunar magnetometer (LMAG)
*Spectral profiler (SP) (resolution per pixel: 562 x 400 m [1840 x 1310 ft)
*Multi-band imager (MI) (resolution of visible light 20 [66 ft] meters per pixel, near-infrared 62 meters [200 ft] per pixel)
*Laser altimeter (LALT)
*Lunar radar sounder (LRS)
*Gamma ray spectrometer (GRS)
*Charged particle spectrometer (CPS)
*Plasma analyzer (PACE)
*Upper atmosphere and plasma imager (UPI)
*Radio wave repeater (RSAT) aboard Okina
*Radio wave source for VLBI (VRAD) aboard Okina and Ouna

Two 2.2 megapixel CCD HDTV cameras, one wide-angle and one telephoto, were also on board, primarily for public outreach. The HDTV system, developed by NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), produced over 1.3 TB of video and stills over 19 months.

JAXA collected names and messages that were carried on SELENE through their &quot;Wish Upon the Moon&quot; campaign. 412,627 names and messages were printed on a sheet measuring 280 mm x 160 mm (11 x 6.3 in) at 70 μm (0.0003 in) per character. The sheet was installed under the photovoltaic modules and cooling panels beneath the multi-layered insulation.

==Results==
Major results include:
*Improved lunar global topography maps. This detailed altitude and geological data was provided to Google for free to make Google Moon 3-D.
*Detailed gravity map of the far side of the Moon.
*First optical observation of the permanently shadowed interior of the crater Shackleton at the lunar south pole.
*Evidence of Earth&#x27;s oxygen being transported to the Moon via magnetospheric ions.

==Other lunar probes==
SELENE was part of a renewed global interest in lunar exploration; it was &quot;the largest lunar mission since the Apollo program&quot;. It followed Japan&#x27;s first lunar probe, Hagoromo, launched in 1990. China launched its Chang&#x27;e 1 lunar explorer on October 24, 2007, followed by India&#x27;s October 22, 2008 launch of Chandrayaan-1 and the United States Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in June 2009. The United States, European countries (ESA), Russia, Japan, India and China are planning future crewed lunar exploration missions or lunar outpost construction on the Moon between 2018 and 2025.

<text>Diana Doherty is an Australian oboist, currently Principal Oboe with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

==Biography==
Diana Doherty was born in Brisbane, where she began her education. She attended Brisbane State High School. She studied both piano and oboe at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, before completing her Bachelor of Arts in Music Performance at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, from where she was awarded the M.E.N.S.A prize for the top graduating student. In 1985 she was a prize winner in the ABC Symphony Australia Young Performers Awards.

She has studied in Zürich with Thomas Indermühle and also taken courses with Maurice Bourgue.

Doherty has performed regularly as a soloist, with performances at various international festivals: the Prague Spring Festival; the MusicaRiva festival in Italy; Bratislava Music Festival; the Young Artist in Concert Festival in Davos, Switzerland. She has toured extensively within the United States, giving recitals and masterclasses, as well as performing in the Chamber Music series at the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, South Carolina, and a concerto performance at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.

From 1990 to 1997, she was Principal Oboe in the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra. In July 1997 she returned to Australia and joined the Sydney Symphony Orchestra as Principal Oboe.

She premiered Ross Edwards&#x27; Oboe Concerto in 2002, under the baton of Lorin Maazel. This unusual work includes choreography for the oboist-cum-dancer. Maazel invited her to play and dance it with the New York Philharmonic in 2005, and Doherty has since become particularly associated with the concerto.

She has recorded the Ross Edwards concerto, as well as works by Haydn, Mozart, Martinů, Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Graeme Koehne, Carl Vine, and others, with orchestras such as the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Lucerne Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, Sinfonia Australis, and the Queensland Orchestra, and under conductors such as Arvo Volmer, Olaf Henzold, Takuo Yuasa, , Mark Summerbell and Werner Andreas Albert.

Diana Doherty uses a Marigaux M2 oboe.

==Personal life==
Doherty is married to Alexandre Oguey, principal cor anglais with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. They have two adult children.

<doc id="851414" wikidata="Q306905" url="?curid=851414" title="Abbywinters.com">
<text>abbywinters.com (or simply Abby Winters) is a pornographic paysite largely revolving around nude modelling pictorials and lesbian and solo sex acts by female models. It claims all-female shooting crews and is part of the &quot;natural&quot;, reality-based porn market. The site was launched in the year 2000 and has since been split into three &quot;mini-sites&quot; known as &#x27;Solo&#x27;, &#x27;Girl-Girl&#x27;, and &#x27;Intimate Moments&#x27; (masturbation).

Abby Winters originated as an Australian site with Australian participants and employees. It is now based in Amsterdam and intermixes its extensive Australian material with new material shot since its move. In addition to pictures and videos of erotic modeling and sex acts, the site also features a range of both scripted and unscripted content.

The site is noted for its mix of professional and amateur models, most of whom had never previously worked in erotic modelling. Material is typically captured with high-quality high-definition video and photography, together with somewhat atypical &quot;signature&quot; capture angles, and has no models with surgically enhanced breasts. Models wear very little make-up and many have a full patch of pubic hair. In addition, the website claims that its photos are not retouched in any way (other than basic colour balancing).

In January 2008, abbywinters.com had about 30,000 subscribers. Despite its history as an Australian website, 65% of Abby Winters subscribers are in the United States.

In 2010, responding to a changing political climate in the Australian government on the question of pornography&#x27;s acceptability in the country, the company&#x27;s offices were moved to the Netherlands. Prior to that relocation, the site&#x27;s web servers had already been based in the Netherlands and the United States for quite some time.

==Description of content==

The website features female models typically between the ages 18 to 25. With the exception of those who are long-time employees of the organisation, of whom there are only a small number, almost all Abby Winters models are completely new to pornography. In photo-based shoots the women are photographed in their own homes and bedrooms and/or in outdoor settings, and usually begin wearing their own clothes and underwear, which they gradually shed. In videos, there may also be candid interviews, but videos on the site involving groups usually have a theme, or at least implied back-story, such as a yoga class beginning fully clothed and gradually shedding garments as the yoga session progresses. According to Adultreviews.com Review of Abby Winters, as of March 2018 there were 1,485 models featured on the site, with more than 500,000 images and 5,459 videos. New content was uploaded twice daily.

Wired.com writer Regina Lynn claimed that the site portrays sex more realistically than most pornography. Customers are able to suggest scenarios on the site&#x27;s forum which are sometimes filmed. After establishing a rough scenario for each shoot the production team then lets the performers decide how fast the scene progresses, and which sex acts they will perform. It is claimed that all scenes are filmed by women, some of whom have previously modelled for the site. Models are paid approximately US$500 for a solo masturbation scene, and US$800 for a sex scene with another model.

==The existence of Abby Winters as person==
According to Garion Hall, Abby Winters is a woman he met in 1999 who wanted to shoot alternative porn and started a website. Garion was involved in running the commercial side. In 2003, she was no longer interested in the matter and Garion bought her out. The character is considered to be invented and a moniker for Garion Hall.

==Company status==
On 1 June 2010, Hall announced that G Media was selling the business to his new Dutch company, and would be moving its operations to Amsterdam, Netherlands because of legal problems in Australia (see below for details). The company had been based in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy before their move. It now operates from an office in central Amsterdam.

In late 2007, the company had also briefly opened a second office in Sydney. In late 2007, the site partnered with Wicked Pictures as the exclusive distributor for Abbywinters.com DVDs.

The company claims to have regularly donated $1,000 a week to various organisations including Samba, ASACP, and other open source projects, as well as health aid organisations. Abby Winters was a &quot;Sustaining Contributor&quot; on the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s Thank GNUs 2007, and on the OpenBSD&#x27;s donations list. It also made a A$78,000 donation to the Black Saturday bushfires appeal.

On 28 June 2023, site owner Garion Hall announced via a publicly available site forum that Abbywinters stopped producing new scenes. He mentioned a lack of profitability and a lack of suitable models. The site will continue to work otherwise but stressed that the company is now in sunset mode and announced it hasn&#x27;t recovered financially from the move.

==Criticism by former model Liandra Dahl==
In 2007, ex-Abby Winters model Helen Corday (then known with the stage name as Liandra Dahl) wrote on her blog about privacy problems concerning G Media sites, which was picked up by the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;.
Dahl was concerned that Abby Winters fails to inform young and inexperienced models that content may be available outside of the confines of the paysite, on file sharing networks, and how their involvement in pornography might revisit them inhibiting their future choices. Dahl later noted that the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; had &quot;misquoted her&quot; and that she didn&#x27;t support the new laws against pornography in Australia.

==Police raid on G Media==
On 16 June 2009, G Media offices in Melbourne were raided by Victoria Police as part of a wider &quot;Operation Refuge&quot;. The &quot;Herald Sun&quot; article gave two grounds for the raid: that G-Media may have filmed an under-age model, and that G Media&#x27;s DVD productions may have contravened Victoria&#x27;s film classification laws. The report stated that CEO Garion Hall was arrested but released later the same day, and claimed that the raid was made in response to information provided by the paper. G Media later released a statement stating that nothing had been seized in the raid, and that the police were polite and amiable throughout. In December 2009 CEO Garion Hall was charged by Victoria Police with 54 counts of making objectionable films for gain, and possessing a commercial quantity of objectionable films. According to a post by Hall on the site, the charges against him were eventually dropped and two charges were filed against the company itself. A judge fined the company $6,000 on 28 May 2010. This combination of legal problems, law enforcement encounters, financial penalties, and a less accepting climate for the company&#x27;s activities, led Hall to move the company out of Australia altogether and relocate it to Amsterdam.

==Censorship==

Abbywinters.com was included on a list published on WikiLeaks, on 19 March 2009, which was alleged to be the Australian Communications and Media Authority blacklist of websites which were due to be prohibited in Australia under the proposed Australian Firewall.

<text>St. Mary&#x27;s Preparatory is a co-educational, Catholic, college preparatory high school with a Polish-American heritage in the Detroit suburb of Orchard Lake Village, Michigan. Its mission and message is &quot;God, Family and St. Mary&#x27;s.&quot;

==Overview==
St. Mary&#x27;s was founded in 1885 on Detroit&#x27;s east side on the corner of Forest and St. Aubin by Rev. Joseph Dabrowski as a school for Polish-American boys to train for the priesthood. The school moved to the 125-acre (0.5 km²) campus of the former Michigan Military Academy on the shores of Orchard Lake in 1909 and is still there today. St. Mary&#x27;s offers a college preparatory education. The campus is shared with SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary and contains some offices and classrooms for Madonna University of Livonia, Michigan. The Felician Sisters from Livonia, Michigan have served the Orchard Lake Schools since 1935. Since 2020, St. Mary&#x27;s Preparatory opened admissions to girls.

==Academics==
St. Mary&#x27;s academic program is designed to meet the basic entrance requirements for any college curriculum. Requirements for graduation are four years of theology and English; four years of mathematics; three years of science and social studies; three years of a foreign language; and a semester each of computer programming, computer applications, physical education, health, fine arts, and speech. Students are required to fulfill 28 credits for graduation. Over 60% of the 90 different courses offered by St. Mary&#x27;s Prep from grades 9-12 are at the honors and AP levels.

Although students need not be Catholic to attend St. Mary&#x27;s, all students are educated in the Catholic tradition. This tradition includes four years of theology in the classroom as well as attendance at Mass twice weekly. Class retreats and other activities are available for students. The school chaplain and many campus priests can guide students regarding their individual programs.

100 percent of St. Mary&#x27;s graduates who apply to college have been accepted. A full-time guidance counselor assists students in selecting colleges and universities. The school held the national record for most students in one year to go to the U.S. Naval Academy (4).

 Students may enjoy walking to classes as the classes are located in different buildings, so the outside walks offer fresh air and scenic views of the campus and Orchard Lake.

St. Mary&#x27;s Preparatory is fully accredited and licensed by the State of Michigan&#x27;s Department of Education, the Michigan Non-Public Schools Accrediting Association (MNSAA), and is a member of the Orchard Lake Schools, the Archdiocese of Detroit, the Detroit Catholic League, the Oakland Schools Consortium, and the Michigan High School Athletic Association.

The St. Mary&#x27;s Ski team practices at Alpine Valley Snow Ski Area in White Lake, Michigan.

<doc id="851428" wikidata="Q1075232" url="?curid=851428" title="Widows and orphans">
<text>In typesetting, widows and orphans are single lines of text from a paragraph that dangle at either the beginning or end of a block of text, or form a very short final line at the end of a paragraph. When split across pages, they occur at either the head or foot of a page (or column), unaccompanied by additional lines from the same paragraph. The pairing of the two terms with their definitions has no consistent standard across the industry; some sources use the opposite meanings as others.

Additionally, runts (which varying sources also call widows or orphans) are cases where a paragraph anywhere on a page ends with a very short final line. They give an impression of excessive empty space between that and the following paragraph.

==Definitions== 
For the purposes of this article, the following meanings are given to the terms. Some sources have these reversed due to a lack of industry standardization.
;Widow (sometimes called orphan): A paragraph-ending line that falls at the beginning of the following page or column, thus separated from the rest of the text. Mnemonically, a widow is &quot;alone at the top&quot; (of the family tree but, in this case, of the page).
;Orphan (sometimes called widow): A paragraph-opening line that appears by itself at the bottom of a page or column, thus separated from the rest of the text. Mnemonically, an orphan is &quot;alone at the bottom&quot; (of the family tree but, in this case, of the page).
;Runt (sometimes called widow or orphan): A word, part of a word, or a very short line that appears by itself at the end of a paragraph. Mnemonically still &quot;alone at the bottom&quot;, just this time at the bottom of a paragraph. Orphans of this type give the impression of too much white space between paragraphs.
== Guidelines ==
Regarding page design and the layout of the text, the 15th edition of &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; (2003) indicates that an edited manuscript should have neither widows nor orphans, even if their elimination leaves blank space at the bottom of the page or of the column of text. The 16th edition of &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; (2011) proposes the acceptability that the layout of some pages can conclude with the first line of a new paragraph at the foot of the page.

The techniques for eliminating widows include:

*Forcing a page break early, producing a shorter page;
*Adjusting the leading, the space between lines of text;
*Adjusting the spacing between words to produce tighter or looser paragraphs;
*Adjusting the hyphenation within the paragraph;
*Adjusting the margins of the page;
*Subtle scaling of the page without distorting the letters;
*Rewriting a portion of the paragraph;
*Reduce the letter-spacing (tracking) of the words;
*Adding a pull quote to the text (usual in magazines); and
*Adding a floating block (figure) to the text, or resizing an existing figure.

An orphan line is more easily deleted, either by inserting a blank line or by forcing a page break to push the orphan line onto the next page, to be part of the paragraph to which the orphan belongs. Similarly, an orphan word at the end of a paragraph can be relocated by forcing one or more words from the preceding text line into the paragraph line of the orphan. In web-publishing, this is typically accomplished by concatenating the words in question with a non-breaking space and, if available, by utilizing the &quot;orphans:&quot; and &quot;widows:&quot; attributes in Cascading Style Sheets. Sometimes it can also be useful to add non-breaking spaces to the first two (or few) short words of a paragraph to avoid having a single orphaned word placed to the left or right of a picture or table, while the remainder of the text (with longer words) would only appear after the table.

Most full-feature word processors and page layout applications include an automatic paragraph setting that prevents widows and orphans; thus, an orphan is forced to the top of the next page or column; and the text line preceding a widow is forced to the next page or column. In technical writing, where a single source may be published in different formats, with the viewer&#x27;s expectation of viewing content in different sizes and resolutions, the paragraph settings automatically prevent widows and orphans. Manual overrides, such as inserted empty lines or extra spaces, can cause the insertion of a white space into the middle of pages.

Symbolism

The eight-pointed star insignia worn by dragoons, the 2d Cavalry having been originally formed as the Second Regiment of Dragoons in 1836. The palmetto leaf represents the Regiment&#x27;s first action against the Seminole Indians in Florida, where the palmetto leaf grows in abundance. The fleur-de-lis is for combat service in France in both World War I and World War II. The motto &quot;Toujours Prêt&quot; (Always Ready) expresses the spirit and élan of the Regiment.

==History==

===Between 1808 and 1815===
In 1808, there was one regiment of light dragoons in the United States and during the War of 1812 another regiment was raised. Units of both regiments of dragoons served in engagements at the Mississineway River; the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane; Fort Erie and the Siege of Fort Meigs. These two regiments were consolidated on 30 March 1814 into the Regiment of Light Dragoons but this new unit was dissolved on 15 June 1815.

===Early organization===

The precursor organization was originally established by President Andrew Jackson on 23 May 1836, as the Second Regiment of Dragoons of the US Army. A and I Companies were recruited in the Fort Myer, Virginia area, B Company recruited from Virginia and Louisiana, C Company drew recruits from Tennessee, E, F, G, and H recruited from New York, and K Company was drawn from New Orleans. D Company was organized from a detachment of the 1st Dragoons and served in Florida immediately. In April 1837, the regimental headquarters was moved to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, where the 400 new recruits and their instructors participated in the School of the Trooper, and learned the tactics and ways of being a dragoon, while some of their compatriots were battling the Indians in Florida.

====Second Seminole War====
The 2nd Dragoons saw their first combat during the Second Seminole War. The 2nd Dragoons brought the fight to the hostile Seminoles, rather than wait to be ambushed inside a fort like other units did. Company D drew first blood on 10 June 1836 in an engagement at Welika Pond, close to Fort Defiance, Florida. In December 1836, A, B, C, E, and I Companies arrived in South Carolina, and immediately moved south. In January 1837, the troopers were engaged by the Seminoles at Fort Mellon only two days after their arrival. On 9 September 1837, three Dragoon companies and two companies of Florida Militia surrounded and raided a hostile village, capturing King Philip, an important chief. On 11 September 1837, Lieutenant John Winfield Scott McNeil was killed by the Seminoles, becoming the first officer of the 2nd Dragoons to die in combat. The regiment under Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney later fought at the Second Battle of the Loxahatchee on 24 January 1838. The 2nd Dragoons would suffer a major defeat at the Battle of the Caloosahatchee on 23 July 1839.

===Mexican–American War===
Under an act of Congress dated 23 August 1842 the regiment was re-designated as the Regiment of Riflemen effective 4 March 1843. This act was repealed on 4 April 1844 and the regiment reverted to its previous designation.

In October 1842, A, D, E, F, and G Companies moved to Fort Jessup, Louisiana and Fort Towson. The remainder of the regiment stayed in Florida to patrol for hostile bands of Seminoles. Fort Jessup became the regimental headquarters, and was the 2nd Dragoons&#x27; home for four years. When hostilities with the Centralist Republic of Mexico began to boil over in 1845, General Zachary Taylor assembled his &quot;Army of Observation&quot; at Fort Jessup, and the 2nd Dragoons marched overland to occupy Corpus Christi, Texas.

They soon established Fort Texas, near modern-day Brownsville, Texas. The regiment conducted aggressive patrolling along the Rio Grande, and on 25 April 1846, they received word that Mexican troops were crossing the river. Two companies of the 2nd Dragoons were ambushed by 500–1,600 Mexican troops (accounts vary), and all were either killed or captured. This battle, known as the Thornton Affair, gave US President Polk the &quot;casus belli&quot; he needed to invade Mexico.

When General Taylor counterattacked, the 2nd Dragoons forced the enemy to turn their flank during the Battle of Palo Alto. The next day, during the Battle of Resaca de la Palma on 9 May 1846, Companies D and E under Captain Charles A. May were ordered to eliminate a battery of Mexican guns. Prior to the charge, May issued a simple order; &quot;Remember your Regiment and follow your officers.&quot; This became the 2nd Dragoon Regiment&#x27;s motto. The attack destroyed the enemy battery and captured a Mexican general.

On 29 June 1846, COL David Twiggs was given command of the regiment from COL William S. Harney, and he was lauded for his bravery at the Battle of Monterrey. COL Twiggs commanded the 2nd Dragoons for the rest of the war, and by the end, the regiment was one of two regiments in the Army that had elements participate in every major battle.

Heroism was not limited to the officers of the 2nd Dragoons; in November 1847, SGT Jack Miller&#x27;s small patrol of 20 Dragoons was ambushed by near Monclova by 100 Mexicans. Reaching for their carbines, SGT Miller urged them to charge with only their sabers. In the ensuing battle, 6 Mexicans were killed, 13 were wounded, and 70 were captured at the cost of 1 wounded Dragoon and 3 wounded horses.

===Frontier duty===
After the Mexican–American War, the 2nd Dragoons headed west to protect the settlers on the new frontier that had just been gained by the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In June 1849, F Company, under MAJ Ripley Arnold, established Fort Worth along the Trinity River. These years were spent patrolling the frontier in order to protect American settlers heading west from hostile Indians. In 1854, the Companies E and K of the regiment defeated a sizable Sioux force in the Battle of Ash Hollow in Nebraska, forcing the Sioux to sign a peace treaty.

In late 1857, in response to growing hostilities between federal authorities and Mormon settlers in Utah, a battalion of the 2nd Dragoons was sent to quell any Mormon resistance to federal power. These Dragoons, under LTC Philip St. George Cooke, joined a 2,500-man expedition and began the march to Utah, and in response, Brigham Young, the Mormon leader, mobilized the Nauvoo Legion to combat this force. Peace talks succeeded before much blood was shed, but the 2nd Dragoons still had to complete a long and arduous winter march across the frontier. The Utah War ended in July 1858. On 14 June 1858, William S. Harney was promoted to Brigadier General, and LTC St. George Cooke was made the 3rd Colonel of the 2nd Dragoons.

On 1 October 1858, other elements of the 2nd Dragoons that hadn&#x27;t gone to Utah were engaging in operations against the Comanche in Texas. In the summer of 1858, a group of Dragoons pursued a number of Comanche who had captured a white child, but soon were ambushed by 25 braves. The firefight escalated and the Dragoons and Texas Rangers fought off a band of roughly 500 Comanches, and killed 70 after five hours of fighting. The captured child was rescued in the end, and the engagement became known as the Battle of the Wichita Village.

===Civil War===
At the onset of the Civil War in 1861, the regiment was recalled to the Eastern theater and redesignated on 3 August 1861 as the Second Cavalry Regiment. Thomas J. Wood was named the fourth Colonel of the regiment, but was promoted out of the job shortly after. Throughout the war, the 2nd Cavalry would be commanded by many company-grade officers such as Captains Wesley Merritt and Theophilus Francis Rodenbough. C Company was the last unit of the regiment to fight as dragoons, during the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek.

For much of the war, the regiment was a key part of either the &quot;Reserve Brigade&quot; or the &quot;Regular Brigade&quot; of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac and served in numerous campaigns and battles. They fought in numerous battles, including the Siege of Yorktown, the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and the Battle of Cold Harbor.

During the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, SGT Martin Hagan of the 2nd Cavalry and a small group of troopers held a Confederate cavalry brigade at bay, covering the Union retreat across the river. This action was completed without the loss of a man or a horse, and SGT Hagan was awarded the regiment&#x27;s first Medal of Honor. The 2nd Cavalry was also present during the Stoneman Raid just prior to the Battle of Chancellorsville. This raid is regarded as the &quot;resurgence of the Union Cavalry.&quot;

During the Battle of Kelly&#x27;s Ford, the 2nd Cavalry became the first Union cavalry regiment to engage Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s cavalry in a head-to-head charge. This action hurt Stuart&#x27;s reputation in the eyes of Southern leadership, just three weeks before the Battle of Gettysburg. Leading up to the Battle of Gettysburg, the 2nd Cavalry fought a continuous recon and counter-recon with Stuart&#x27;s cavalry until the two armies met at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Here, the regiment dismounted and skirmished the Confederates in a delaying action until the main Union force could reach the battlefield.

During the Battle of Trevilian Station in June 1864, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment charged the Confederate Cavalry and smashed their lines. CPT T.F. Rodenbough led the charge and was wounded, and earned the Medal of Honor for his heroism in this brief but savage charge. Returning to duty in September 1864, he led the regiment in another charge during the Third Battle of Winchester. He was wounded again and lost his mount and right arm. First Sergeant Conrad Schmidt of K Company bravely rode back under fire to rescue his regimental commander. Schmidt was given the Medal of Honor for his swift and courageous action.

On 9 October 1864, the 2nd Cavalry, as part of the reserve brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division, the regiment attacked the flanks of the Confederate line, forcing them to retreat. During this action, PVT Edward Hanson of H Company earned the Medal of Honor for braving enemy fire to capture the flag of the 32nd Virginia Cavalry. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment earned 14 battle streamers and 5 Medals of Honor during their Civil War service.

Like the other early mounted units, many members of the Second Cavalry went on to higher ranks and command positions on both sides during the war. A former lieutenant of the regiment, Colonel Orton Williams, C.S.A who had been commissioned into the regiment on the recommendation of Robert E. Lee, was hanged as a spy by the federal authorities in 1863.

===Indian wars===
When the Civil War ended, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was sent west to fight against hostile Indian tribes and protect American settlers. With US troops focused on fighting Confederate forces in the east, the Indians of the frontier grew bolder. The vastness of the American frontier meant that the regiment was seldom together, and was spread out, often with only one troop occupying a post.

In December 1866, 25 troopers of the 2nd Cavalry under LT George W. Grummond accompanied CPT William J. Fetterman in his expedition against Chief Red Cloud. In northern Wyoming, these 81 men were engaged by a force of roughly 1,000 Indians, where they were all massacred in a desperate battle. On 29 June 1867, a small party of 10 troopers and 1 Indian scout under LT Lyman Kidder were ordered to take dispatches from General William Sherman to LTC George A. Custer.

Custer grew impatient and moved out ahead of schedule, and when LT Kidder&#x27;s party arrived, they found the camp to be deserted. Making their way to Fort Wallace, the troopers were set upon by a band of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors near present-day Goodland, Kansas. The 12 cavalrymen and scout were surrounded and killed to a man, and their bodies were scalped and mutilated. However, they managed to kill an enemy chief, Yellow Horse, in the fight (known as the Kidder massacre).

On 23 January 1870, elements of Companies F, G, H, and L participated in the Marias Massacre in the Montana Territory, where 200 Piegan Blackfeet Indians were killed. After this massacre, Federal Indian policy changed under President Grant, and more peaceful solutions were sought. On 15 May 1870, SGT Patrick James Leonard was leading a party of 4 other troopers from C Company along the Little Blue River in Nebraska attempting to locate stray horses. A band of 50 Indians surrounded this detachment and the men raced for cover and made a fortified position with their two dead horses.

One trooper, PVT Thomas Hubbard, was wounded, but they managed to hold the Indians at bay and inflicted several casualties. When the hostile band retreated after an hour of fighting, the troopers left, took a settler family under their charge and returned safely. All 5 men were awarded the Medal of Honor (SGT Patrick J. Leonard, and PVTs Heth Canfield, Michael Himmelsback, Thomas Hubbard, and George W. Thompson). Today, junior NCOs in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment compete for the Sergeant Patrick James Leonard award.

On 17 March 1876, troopers from Companies E, I, and K (156 men) joined the 3rd US Cavalry Regiment under COL Joseph J. Reynolds to combat the Cheyenne and Lakota in the ill-fated Big Horn Expedition. During the Battle of Powder River, the cavalrymen attacked, but were repulsed, and the 2nd Cavalry lost 1 man killed and 5 wounded. 66 men also suffered from frostbite. The 2nd Cavalry was once again repulsed by the Cheyenne and Lakota at the Battle of the Rosebud on 17 June 1876, and only a few days later, Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry were defeated at the Battle of Little Bighorn.

By April 1877, most of the US cavalry was in the west, fighting against bands of hostile Indians. The Cheyenne surrendered in December, Sitting Bull escaped to Canada, and Crazy Horse, the victorious chief in the Battles of the Rosebud and Little Bighorn, surrendered in April 1878. Chief Lame Deer was one of the last Lakota war-chiefs left resisting the US Government. The &quot;Montana Battalion&quot; of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment eventually caught up with his band near the Little Muddy Creek, Montana on 6 May 1878. After a midnight march, the troopers surprised Lame Deer&#x27;s warriors at dawn on 7 May.

H Company charged the village and scattered the enemy horses, while the remaining troopers charged and routed the band of Lakota. During the intense battle, PVT William Leonard of L Company became isolated, and defended his position behind a large rock for two hours before he was rescued by his comrades. He, and PVT Samuel D. Phillips of H Company both earned the Medal of Honor for their gallantry in this battle. While searching the ruined village, the troopers found many uniforms, guidons, and weapons from the 7th Cavalry Regiment, and they left knowing that they had avenged those fallen at Little Bighorn.

On 20 August 1877, elements of the 2nd Cavalry which had been pursuing Chief Joseph&#x27;s band of Nez Perce Indians through Idaho reported that their quarry had turned on them, stole their pack train, and began attempting to escape to Canada. Despite being low on supplies, L Troop and two additional Troops of the 1st Cavalry were dispatched to retrieve the pack train. After a hard ride, the Indians were overtaken and a fierce battle ensued.

CPL Harry Garland, wounded and unable to stand, continued to direct his men in the battle until the Indians withdrew. For his actions, he would receive the Medal of Honor along with three other men from L Troop; 1SG Henry Wilkens, PVT Clark, and Farrier William H. Jones. Today, the annual award for the most outstanding trooper in the 2nd Cavalry is called the Farrier Jones Award. On 18 September, a force of 600 men under General Oliver Otis Howard and Colonel Nelson A. Miles, including Troops F, G, and H of the 2nd Cavalry, marched to stop Chief Joseph&#x27;s band from reaching Canada. L Troop was sent back to Fort Ellis to gather supplies but would join the expedition later.

On 30 September 1877, the Battle of Bear Paw Mountain began. The three Troops of 2nd Cavalry were dispatched to drive away the Indians&#x27; ponies by attacking their rear. G Troop, under LT Edward John McClernand, caught up with Chief White Bird as he and his band tried to escape to Canada. The ensuing engagement was brief, but violent, and resulted in the capture of the Indians and their mounts. Lt McClernand was awarded the Medal of Honor for his gallantry. After a four-day siege, Chief Joseph surrendered his band to General Howard on 4 October 1877.

In the fall of 1878, the 2nd Cavalry was posted in two forts in Montana; Fort Custer and Fort Keogh with the mission of preventing Chief Sitting Bull from returning to US territory after escaping to Canada. In early winter, Chiefs Dull Knife and Little Wolf left their reservations in Oklahoma and began moving northwards. Dull Knife was intercepted and surrendered at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, but Little Wolf sought shelter in the Sand Hills of Wyoming. Elements of E and I Troop under LT William P. Clark (who had earned a special rapport with the Indians) were sent to negotiate with these stalwarts.

The band was located near Box Elder Creek, Montana on 25 March 1879, and was persuaded to accompany the troopers back to Fort Keogh. During the march back, on 5 April, several Indians escaped and attacked the soldiers. SGT T.B. Glover took 10 men of B Troop and charged the numerically superior enemy, forcing them to surrender. SGT Glover received the Medal of Honor for this action. Chief Little Wolf eventually surrendered his band when the party returned to Fort Keogh.

In the winter of 1886, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was charged with preventing Indians from crossing the border from Canada and protecting settlers in Montana and Wyoming. In early March 1887, a large band of Sioux entered Montana from Canada without warning, and C Troop from Camp Stambaugh, Wyoming and E Troop from Fort Sanders, Wyoming were sent to pursue them. After a 150-mile chase, the combatants met at O&#x27;Fallon&#x27;s Creek, Montana. In the fierce battle that followed, the cavalrymen killed many braves and captured 46 of their horses.

CPT Eli L. Huggins and 2LT Lloyd M. Brett both earned the Medal of Honor during this battle for their intrepid leadership and courage. This action forced the Sioux to flee back to Canada. CPT Huggins became the 12th Colonel of the 2nd Cavalry, and today, the annual Regimental award for the most outstanding junior officer is named in honor of CPT Eli L. Huggins.

During the Indian Wars, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment earned 13 battle streamers to add to their flag, and 15 troopers received the Medal of Honor for their gallantry.

===Spanish–American War===
When the Spanish–American War began, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was stationed in Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico and assembled together in Georgia, the first time the entire regiment had been together since the Civil War. The troopers and horses of Troops A, C, D, and F boarded transports in Mobile, Alabama and set sail for Cuba, while the rest of the regiment traveled overland to Tampa, Florida. Due to a lack of transports, they served as logistical troops, and helped load units like Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders onto their ships. These four troops quickly found that they were the only horse-mounted cavalry units in Cuba, and soon began working for General William Rufus Shafter. Joining Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders, the 2nd Cavalry fought at the Battle of El Caney, the Battle of San Juan Hill, the Battle of the Aguadores, and the Siege of Santiago. During the armistice period, the women and children of Santiago were sent out of the city and into American lines to a camp in El Caney. D Troop was in charge of feeding and policing these 22,000 refugees. B Troop was committed to the Puerto Rican Campaign in July and August 1898, but illness forced them to return to the US. In January 1899, the entire regiment began pacification duty in Cuba where they remained for three years, facilitating public education and improving the island&#x27;s sanitation.

===The Philippines and the Mexican Border===
The 2nd Cavalry Regiment was sent to the Philippines during the Philippine Insurrection soon after their tenure in Cuba. From 23 January – 18 July 1905, they participated in the Cavite Campaign, working to root out insurgents and secure the surrounding countryside. On 14 February 1910, the troopers of the 2nd Cavalry fought in the Battle of Tiradores Hill on Mindanao island. Their next clashes were during the Moro Rebellion on Jolo island. They fought in the Battle of Mount Bagoak on 3 December 1911, and the Battle of Mount Vrut from 10 to 12 January 1912. The regiment continued patrolling and security operations until they arrived home in June 1912.

When they returned to the US in 1912, the 2nd Cavalry was sent to the border of Mexico to enforce border laws and prevent raids by &quot;banditos&quot;. The regiment&#x27;s sector extended from El Paso, Texas all the way to Presidio, Texas, a stretch of 262 miles. The troopers were busily engaged in the duties of border surveillance and border security. In December 1913, the 2nd Cavalry was moved out of their post at Fort Bliss and sent to Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont to conduct maneuvers with several Army National Guard units. In 1914, troopers of the 2nd Cavalry were selected to represent the US Army in the annual horse show in Madison Square Garden in New York City.

===World War I===
The USA entered World War I on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment, while at Fort Ethan Allen, was split into thirds; one third remained as the 2nd Cavalry, and the other two became the 18th Cavalry Regiment and the 19th Cavalry Regiment. These &quot;skeletons&quot; of cadre were then recruited to full strength. Later in the year, the 18th Cavalry was redesignated as the 76th Field Artillery Regiment, and the 19th Cavalry was redesignated as the 77th Field Artillery Regiment. The 76th Field Artillery served with the 3rd Infantry Division during the war and their unit heraldry still bears the insignia of the 2nd Dragoons. The 77th Field Artillery served with distinction with the 4th Infantry Division.

General Pershing, the commander of the American Expeditionary Force, arrived in France on 26 June 1917, and 31 troopers from the 2nd Cavalry Headquarters Troop served as his escort. These were the first American troops to land on European soil in the First World War. April 1918 saw the rest of the 2nd Cavalry arrive in France. The regiment was sent to the Toul sector and was initially used to manage horse remount depots and as a military police unit. Troops B, D, F, and H were formed into a provisional squadron and were the last element of the regiment to engage the enemy as horse-mounted cavalry. The 2nd Cavalry fought in the Aisne-Marne Offensive from 18 July – 6 August 1918, and assisted the 1st Infantry Division and the 2nd Infantry Division penetrate the German flanks at Soissons. Detachments of the 2nd Cavalry also fought in the Oise-Aisne Offensive from 8 August – 11 September 1918. The troopers of the 2nd Cavalry also served with distinction in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel; Troops A, B, C, D, F, G, and H fought valiantly under the command of LTC D.P.M. Hazzard from 12 to 16 September.

At this point in the war, 6 American divisions massed on an 18-mile front separate from any European command. The 1st Infantry Division began their attack on Mount Sec and reached the Germans reserve lines. From here, the 2nd Cavalry passed through the forest and scouted the open country around Heudicourt, Creue, and Vigneulles. Elements of the regiment advanced to Saint Maurice, Woël, and Jonville to pursue the retreating enemy.

The 2nd Cavalry&#x27;s next engagement, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, would be the largest battle the AEF would fight in World War I. From 26 September – 11 November 1918, the regiment was attached to the 35th Infantry Division and served as the left flank of the advance. Later they served as the main effort of the advance between the Meuse River and the Argonne Forest. From 26 September-2 October, spearheading the assault on the left flank, the 2nd Cavalry fought in a six-day running battle starting in Vauquois and winding through the woods nearby. The men from the Regiment were commended for &quot;...accomplishing their tasks with fearlessness, courage, and disregard for danger and hardship.&quot; By the end of the war, 2nd Cavalry troopers had earned three more campaign streamers for the regimental standard for their gallant service.

The 2nd Cavalry remained in Koblenz, Germany as part of the Army of Occupation until August 1919.

===Interwar period===

In the years prior to American entry into the Second World War, the 2nd Cavalry was garrisoned at Fort Riley, Kansas from 1919 to 1939. They performed their peacetime duties as a school training regiment for the Cavalry School. Here at Fort Riley, the regiment was equipped with its first armored cars in 1936, the year they celebrated their centennial, marking 100 years of proud national service. In 1938, the 1st Armored Regiment and the 13th Armored Regiment joined the 2nd Cavalry for maneuvers at Fort Riley, to practice and develop combined arms tactics. These maneuvers combined infantry, cavalry, armored, artillery, and aviation units.

===World War II===

Nazi Germany&#x27;s Invasion of Poland in 1939 forced American strategists to focus on building up the Army&#x27;s armored capabilities, and the Attack on Pearl Harbor thrust the US into the war. On 15 July 1942, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was inactivated, and all the troops and equipment were transferred to the newly formed 2nd Armored Regiment, 9th Armored Division. The regiment was reactivated on 15 January 1943 at Fort Riley as the 2nd Mechanized Cavalry Group, or the 2nd MCG (Between 1943 and 1946 cavalry were organized into Groups, but this term is interchangeable with Regiment in this context). Charles H. Reed became the 31st Colonel of the Regiment. It was reorganized as the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (HHT), 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized (present day 1st Squadron), and 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized (present day 2nd Squadron). In July 1944, the 2nd MCG landed in Normandy as part of General Patton&#x27;s Third Army. Their early assignments during the Battle of Normandy included rear area security, attempting to disrupt the activities of German infiltrators. They were then attached to General Troy Middleton&#x27;s VIII Corps during Operation Cobra, and served as a flank security and reconnaissance element for the 4th Armored Division. The cavalry scouts performed such daring reconnaissance missions that their German foes gave them the nickname, &quot;Ghosts of Patton&#x27;s Army.&quot; In August, the 2nd MCG conducted recon of the city of Nantes and aggressively used its light armor and firepower to probe the edges of the &quot;Wehrmacht&#x27;s&quot; defense.

As the Third Army began to advance east, the 2nd MCG protected the vulnerable rear and supply lines over a large frontage of 45 miles between Nantes and Angers, as well as the area west of Nantes. In small patrols, the cavalrymen screened the main drive east and disrupted German movement in the Rennes-Nantes Corridor for ten days until 23 August 1944. Now assigned to XII Corps, the 2nd MCG began moving east toward Lorraine. On 26 August, the 42nd Squadron attacked a German regimental-sized unit near Carisey, protecting the southern flank of the 4th Armored Division as it drove on Troyes. On 30 August, the Dragoons led the XII Corps assault across the Marne River, with the 2nd Squadron in front of the 80th Infantry Division and the 42nd Squadron in front of the 4th Armored Division. By 2 September, the drive reached the Moselle River near Toul and the 2nd Squadron began scouting for possible crossing points. Despite a failed crossing attempt by 80th Division troops against stiff resistance, the 2nd MCG was active in scouting and screening during this period. On 4 September, B and F Troops of the 42nd Squadron defeated a column of 1,000 German soldiers attempting to attack the XII Corps flank by massing direct fire from their light tanks, and indirect fire from artillery units.

On 7 September, the 602nd Tank Destroyer Battalion, equipped with M18 Hellcats, was attached to the 2nd MCG. This allowed the 42nd Squadron to assault and capture Fort de Pont-Saint-Vincent and defeat an enemy counterattack. The 2nd MCG then began to protect the southern flank of the 4th Armored Division as it fought to envelop Nancy on 11 September 1944. They were often engaged in heavy contact against German units while protecting the flanks of the 4th Armored Division&#x27;s assault. On 16 September, the Dragoons launched a squadron-sized attack on Lunéville. The Germans put up a vigorous defense but could not hold against the 2nd MCG, and retreated. However, on 18 September, elements of the 111th Panzer Brigade counterattacked with &quot;six Panther tanks and two companies of infantry.&quot; The Panzers&#x27; armor was too thick and the cavalrymen were forced to retreat. This was the beginning of the Battle of Arracourt. Conducting a delaying action, the two squadrons worked in tandem and managed to keep the enemy at bay until 1100, when reinforcements of the 4th Armored Division arrived and beat back the Germans. This battle provides a perfect example of how Mechanized Cavalry Groups were designed to function in World War II. Had it not been for the screening and delaying efforts of the 2nd MCG, the main effort of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; attack would have fallen on the flank of the 4th Armored Division.

In late October, the 2nd MCG was assigned to protect the flanks of the 26th Infantry Division by seizing Moncourt Ridge. Despite fierce German resistance, the 42nd Squadron dismounted and attacked along a two-mile front and seized their objectives. The attack was conducted entirely dismounted with cavalrymen acting as infantry, much like dragoons, and showed that MCG&#x27;s could be flexible. The cavalry group continued to screen and protect the flanks of the 26th Division until 22 November, when the 2nd MCG was split up. The 2nd Squadron remained in the south to cover the gap and maintain contact between XII Corps and XV Corps of the Seventh Army. The 42nd Squadron was sent north to assist the 80th Infantry Division and maintain contact with XX Corps.

On 14 December 1944, the 2nd MCG joined the 35th Infantry Division as it was assaulting the Siegfried Line. They were relieved on 22 December by the 44th Infantry Division and moved north to assist in the relief of Bastogne. Holding the flank against the Germans, the 2nd MCG freed up troops needed for the assault on the southern shoulder of the Bastogne salient. This period was marked by active patrolling and small unit actions to harass the Germans and divert their attention from their main objectives. In early January 1945, C Troop of the 2nd Squadron seized the town of Machtum, killing nine Germans and capturing fourteen, while only losing three wounded.

On 7 February 1945, the 2nd MCG screened the advance of the XII Corps across the Sauer River, and conducted their own assault across the Moselle on 19 February in order to support the advance of the 10th Armored Division. The 2nd Squadron dismounted and led the attack; they seized the town of Wincheringen, and captured 30–40 Germans at the loss of 5 killed and 22 wounded. Conducting limited patrols along the Moselle, the 2nd MCG was assigned to the 76th Infantry Division and was sent to clear the compromised southern flank of the division. After completing this mission, the 42nd Squadron attacked the town of Zemmer on 7 March, and killed 10 Germans, and captured 61. On 2 April, the cavalrymen, conducting scouting and screening missions, located and liberated 3,328 US and 3,205 Allied POWs, including a Soviet general near Bad Orb. The rapid nature of the US advance made rear security of paramount importance, and the 2nd MCG conducted this mission along with other cavalry units. On 10 April, the 42nd Squadron attacked 300 SS troops and 3 tanks near Gleicherwiesen, destroying the enemy&#x27;s freedom of movement and protecting the advance of XII Corps.

One of the most remarkable missions the 2nd MCG performed was at the end of the war. On 28 April, A Troop, 42nd Squadron seized the town of Hostouň in Czechoslovakia in order to liberate Allied POWs. They discovered 300 POWs, as well as 670 horses, including the famous Lipizzaner stallions. General Patton, a cavalryman himself, ordered their rescue when he learned that the Lipizzaners would fall under Soviet control. On 12 May, four days after VE Day, &quot;Operation Cowboy&quot; was launched to rescue the fine horses, and all were successfully herded or ridden back to American lines. This was dramatized by Walt Disney in the 1963 movie, &quot;Miracle of the White Stallions&quot;.

===Cold War===
The Cold War began in 1945 with the ending of World War II, and the 2nd Cavalry was charged with conducting border surveillance along the Iron Curtain. In 1951, the regiment was headquartered in Nuremberg and operated out of the cities of Freising and Augsburg. In 1955, the cavalry returned to the US and were relieved by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. They returned to West Germany in 1958, and would remain there for the next 33 years; they operated out of Nuremberg, Feucht, Bindlach, Amberg, and Bamberg. Throughout this period, the 2nd Cavalry was responsible for reconnoitering and providing border security along 731 kilometers of the Iron Curtain; 375 km along with West German-East German border, and 365 km along the West German-Czechoslovak border. In 1978, M Troop, of 3rd Squadron, was selected to represent the US in the 1979 Canadian Army Trophy (CAT), finishing 4th – the first time the US entrant had not placed last. In 1989, the Iron Curtain was lifted, and the regiment halted their border security missions on 1 March 1990.

====Persian Gulf War====
When the Persian Gulf War began in 1990, the regiment was ordered to move to Saudi Arabia and prepare for combat operations. By mid-December, the 2nd ACR had established itself in the VII Corps sector of the Saudi desert and began training to fight. The 210th Field Artillery Brigade, AH-64 Apache helicopters from 2-1 Aviation Battalion, and the 82nd Engineer Battalion joined the regiment to form &quot;Dragoon Battle Group&quot;, a force of 8,500 soldiers.

On 23 February 1991, the 2nd Cavalry attacked across the Saudi–Iraq border after preparatory fires, and engaged in their first combat operation in 45 years. Spearheading the VII Corps advance, the regiment attacked into southern Iraq and fought a series of sharp battles with four divisions of the Iraqi Army. The 2nd and 3rd Squadrons of the regiment destroyed two brigades of the Iraqi Republican Guards Tawakalna Division in the Battle of 73 Easting. The 2nd Squadron, 2nd ACR alone contributed 55 Iraqi tanks destroyed, 45 other armored vehicles, an equal number of trucks, hundreds of Iraqi infantry KIA, and 865 Iraqi soldiers taken prisoner. The unit earned the Valorous Unit Award for its service in Operation Desert Storm. By the end of its covering force mission in Iraq, the 2nd ACR had broken the Republican Guard&#x27;s defensive line, provided intelligence to the VII Corps commander, and moved over 250 kilometers. It also captured 2,000 prisoners, destroyed 159 enemy tanks, and 260 other vehicles. The regiment&#x27;s losses include 6 Dragoons killed, and 19 wounded.

===Haiti===
Returning from the Gulf, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment was inactivated at Nuremberg, Germany. The regiment was reactivated as the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (Light) in 1993 by renaming the previous 199th Infantry Brigade (Motorized), the former 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, at Fort Lewis, Washington. The regiment&#x27;s ground squadrons became light cavalry units equipped with Humvees mounted with TOW launchers, Mk 19 grenade launchers, .50 caliber machine guns and M249 light machine guns (SAWs). The 2nd ACR (Light) was then sent to Fort Polk in Louisiana in 1993. From there, the regiment deployed in support of the peace enforcement operation in Haiti from 1995 to 1996; Operation Uphold Democracy. The 3rd Squadron (&quot;Wolfpack&quot;) was the first ground unit to deploy and operated under the 25th Infantry Division in Port au Prince, Haiti. After six months in Haiti, 1st Squadron arrived to replace 3rd Squadron. In October 1995, 2nd Squadron replaced 3rd Squadron and redeployed in March 1996 completing the cycle. In Haiti the Dragoons served in a number of different roles. They guarded humanitarian relief convoys, and served as the United Nations Quick Reaction Force (UNQRF). They also seized illegal weapons, conducted security patrols, and protected the Haitian president, and the US President (Bill Clinton) and Vice President (Al Gore) when they visited the island.

===Bosnia service===
In April 1997, the regiment received orders to be prepared to deploy to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the first mission rehearsal exercise held at the JRTC in June, the unit moved to Germany to begin integration with the 1st Armored Division. Meanwhile, all its equipment was shipped to the intermediate staging base at Taszar, Hungary.

The regiment&#x27;s participation in Operation Joint Guard began when the 2nd and 3rd Squadrons moved across the Sava River into Bosnia in August 1997 to augment the 1st Infantry Division (Forward) in support of Bosnia-Herzegovina&#x27;s municipal elections. The regiment&#x27;s air cavalry, the 4th Squadron and the Regimental Support Squadron also moved into the country. The regiment&#x27;s separate units – the 502nd Military Intelligence Company; the 84th Engineer Company; Company H (Aviation Maintenance), 159th Aviation Regiment; and the Air Defense Battery – completed the regimental troop list.

While the ground squadrons were in Bosnia, the regimental headquarters deployed to Germany to train with the 1st Armored Division Headquarters in preparation for assuming command in Bosnia. During August and September, the regiment was spread across five countries on two continents, and was under the direct command and control of three different general officer commands. This period included another first for any Army unit during a 12-month period: the regiment participated in major training exercises at all three of the Army&#x27;s combat training centers: The National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, and the Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) at Hohenfels, Germany. In October the remainder of the regiment rode into theater, assuming responsibility for the American sector of Multinational Division (North), which stretched from the war-torn bridge at Brčko in the north to the shattered city of Srebrenica in the south.

The first major action of the regiment in Bosnia was the seizing of Serbian radio-television towers to control communications into the Republika Srpska. Other significant operations that the regiment conducted include: the restructuring of the Republika Srpska Specialist Police; the creation of the first multi-ethnic police department, in the city of Brčko; security for the announcement of the Brcko Arbitration Decision (an effort to resolve the status of this Serb-dominated city within Bosnia); institution of common license plates and currency in Bosnia, and the opening of the Bosnian rail system. In conducting operations in this sector, the regiment executed an estimated 12,500 patrols and 480 weapon storage site inspections, supervised the removal of over 12,000 mines, and oversaw 350 training exercises for the former warring factions. The regiment served one of the longest tours of military units there.

===Global War on Terrorism===
After returning from Bosnia, the unit remained at Fort Polk, Louisiana. On 13 April 2002, B Troop, 1-2 Cavalry deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Global War of Terrorism. They provided port and site security in Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, and Djibouti, and were relieved by L Troop, 3-2 Cavalry, in October, who continued these duties.

====Iraq War====
On 25 March 2003, 2nd Squadron was deployed again to the Gulf for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The squadron began combat operations by 1 April 2003. The rest of the regiment arrived in May and operated in eastern Baghdad. The troopers worked to improve the peoples&#x27; lives, and provided security to infrastructure sites such as power stations, telephone stations, fuel stations, schools, and hospitals. The 2nd Armored Cavalry also took direct action in hundreds of raids to disrupt the activities of the Fedayeen Saddam militia. The regiment also trained several companies of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) to assist their operations. On 19 August 2003, a VBIED detonated near a UN compound and a spinal cord clinic causing consternation and much damage. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry rushed to secure the area, and saved the lives of 125 UN workers.

On 4 April 2004, the 2nd Armored Cavalry and the 1st BCT-1st Cavalry Division engaged in fierce urban fighting during the Siege of Sadr City. The Dragoons and thousands of Muqtada al-Sadr&#x27;s militiamen, the Mahdi Army, clashed in a violent battle that cost 8 US and 300 enemy deaths. This initial battle marked the beginning of several more uprisings throughout Iraq, and the 2nd Cavalry was soon sent south to battle insurgents in Hillah, Al Kut, An Najaf, Kufa, and Al Diwaniyah. This action forced them to stay in Iraq for a further three months. The battles of Al Kut, Kufa, and Al Diwaniyah were short, but intense. The regiment was forced to retake each town from hostile forces and seize government buildings. In An Najaf, hundreds of Mahdi Militiamen fought a protracted urban campaign that lasted a few weeks. In late June 2004, the 2nd Cavalry was relieved by elements of the 1st Infantry Division and returned to Fort Polk on 15 July 2004. In Iraq, the Dragoons suffered 21 killed and over 100 wounded. They had inflicted 1,000 deaths on their enemy and captured hundreds more. A total of 16 months was spent in combat, and the regiment earned another Presidential Unit Citation. On its return from combat operations, the 2nd ACR found itself heading back to Fort Lewis in Washington in December 2004. The regiment was re-designated the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and reorganized as a Stryker brigade combat team in April 2005.

On 1 June 2006 at Fort Lewis, Washington, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division conducted a joint re-flagging and Casing of the Colors ceremony. The 2nd CR was reflagged as the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Stryker). The 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division cased its brigade colors and was reflagged as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment. The Army re-stationed 2nd SCR to Rose Barracks, Vilseck, Germany, near the regiment&#x27;s Cold War home of Nuremberg, as of 15 September 2006. With a foundation of infantry-based tactics and the mobility of the Stryker vehicle, the Stryker unit has become more of a hybrid, filling the gap between pure, light infantry and the mechanized, heavy infantry.

On 12 August 2007, the Dragoons arrived in Kuwait and prepared for another combat deployment in Iraq. On 13 September, the regiment replaced the 3rd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Liberty, Baghdad as part of President George W. Bush&#x27;s surge campaign. 1st Squadron (War Eagles), with Troops A, B, and C, was sent to NE Baghdad to work in Sadr City, Hayy Ur, Thawra, Jamilla, and Adhamiyah. They conducted numerous cordon-and-search, checkpoint, and raid missions until the Jaysh al-Mahdi uprising in March 2008. Joining with Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police, 1st Squadron fought these insurgents until a ceasefire was brokered on 11 March. The squadron assisted building a security wall in Sadr City and conducted many civic action projects until it was sent to Mosul in August 2008 to assist the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment quell the violence in that city.

2nd Squadron (Cougars), with Troops D, E, and F, was sent to East Rashid in south central Baghdad. E Troop was quickly lauded for its aggressive operations against Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) extremists, which resulted in 10 wounded Dragoons and 13 enemy killed in action. Working alongside the 3rd Squadron (Wolfpack), with Troops G, H, I, and N, they cleared the neighborhoods of Dora and Hadar in Operation Dragoon Talon. The combined effort of 2nd Squadron and 3rd Squadron cleared out East Rashid or AQI insurgents, and allowed local nationals to return to their homes.

While 2nd Squadron was in East Rashid until May 2008, 3rd Squadron was acting as the Corps reserve and sent to Diyala Governorate to conduct clearing operations with the 4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. G, H, and I Troops were sent to the &quot;breadbasket of Iraq&quot; in the Hamrin Mountains during Operation Raider Harvest to clear out AQI strongholds. From December 2007-October 2008, the region was made safer and infrastructure was improved by the squadron as they defeated numerous AQI cells and conducted humanitarian operations.

4th Squadron (Sabre), with Troops O, P, Q, and elements of I moved to FOB Prosperity in the Al Karkh district of the Green Zone. Here, the troopers secured the heart of Baghdad and turned it into one of the most secure areas of the city; they successfully partnered with units of the Iraqi Army and police to accomplish this mission.

Fires Squadron (Hell), with A, B, and C Batteries along with support from K Troop, was based out of Camp Taji to secure the region of Agar Quf northeast of Baghdad. C Battery acted as the reserve force of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division and conducted air assault mission to kill or capture high value targets. The remainder of the squadron continued to secure the Agar Quf region and conducted both combat and humanitarian operations. In January 2008, Fires Squadron was returned to Regimental control, and 1st Battalion-21st Infantry Regiment (Gimlets) was attached to the 2nd Cavalry.

In April 2008, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment moved to Diyala Governorate to replace the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division and joined with elements of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment to combat extremist Sunni and Shia militias. The Dragoons also conducted humanitarian operations and partnered with their Iraqi allies to make this possible. In Operation Glad Tidings of Benevolence 50,000 Iraqi soldiers and police officers assisted the regiment in aiding the community, as well as clearing out villages, roads, and farms controlled by terrorist forces.

At the completion of this 15-month tour in Iraq, it was at its most consolidated by June 2008 with all units in Diyala but 1st Squadron, which was in Sadr City. On 25 November 2008, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (Stryker) was officially welcomed back to Vilseck, Germany on 7 October 2008. In Iraq from 2007 to 2008, the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment lost 29 soldiers killed, 250 injured, and 70 vehicles were damaged. They managed to kill over 100 confirmed enemies and capture 1,100 more. 100,000 IEDs, weapons, and other enemy materiel items were either captured or destroyed.

====War in Afghanistan====
On 15 March 2010, the Department of Defense announced that the 2nd Cavalry Regiment would deploy to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and the International Security Assistance Force in July 2010. In July 2010, 1st Squadron assumed responsibility of Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan in Uruzgan Province as well as the Shah Wali Kot District serving alongside Australia&#x27;s 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The remainder of the regiment was located in the volatile Kandahar Province with regimental headquarters located at FOB Lagman. 3d Squadron was sent to the Maiwand district in support of Combined Task Force Strike. During their attachment to CTF Strike, 3d Squadron took part in battle harden operations such as Operation Dragon Strike in which 3d Squadron, along with the other units in the CTF, earned the Presidential Unit Citation along with several personal medals for valor for the intense fighting and stabilization brought back to the region which took place during the operation.

In the summer of 2013, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment deployed to Afghanistan for a second time in southern Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and the International Security Assistance Force. The Regiment redeployed to Rose Barracks in April 2014. The Regiment was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for their efforts in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan.

<text>The Krayot or Qerayot (, &quot;townships&quot;) (plural of &quot;Kirya&quot;) are a cluster of four small cities and two neighbourhoods of Haifa founded in the 1930s on the outskirts of the city of Haifa, Israel, in the Haifa Bay area.

The Krayot include Kiryat Yam (pop. 42,284), Kiryat Motzkin (pop. 48,748), Kiryat Bialik (pop. 36,200), Kiryat Ata (pop. 61,709), Kiryat Haim (pop. 29,000), and Kiryat Shmuel (pop. 7,740, as of 2023).

A plan was formulated in 2003, and again in 2016 by Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, to merge the Krayot into one municipality. A proposed name for this city is Zvulun (after the biblical Zebulun, and the Zvulun Valley).

<text>The AEA Explorer (sometimes called the Explorer Explorer) is a large single-engine utility aircraft.

==Design and development==
The explorer is a single-engined strut-braced high-wing monoplane with a retractable tricycle landing gear that retracts into under-fuselage sponsons. The prototype, designated Explorer 350R first flew in 1998 and was soon exhibited on promotional tours of Australia and the United States.

The Explorer is being offered in two versions – the turboprop-powered version, the 500T (which first flew in 2000), and a stretched version of the 500T, designated 750T.

Explorer Aircraft was established in Jasper, Texas to market the aircraft for the US market.

<doc id="851453" wikidata="Q16029378" url="?curid=851453" title="Moses Sherman">
<text>Moses Hazeltine Sherman (December 3, 1853 – September 9, 1932) was an American land developer who built the Phoenix Street Railway in Phoenix, Arizona, and streetcar systems that would become the core of the Los Angeles Railway and part of the Pacific Electric Railway in Los Angeles, California, and owned and developed property in areas such as the westside of Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, Los Angeles. He also served on the Los Angeles Water Board. He was also known as M. H. Sherman and General M. H. Sherman.

==Early life==

Moses Sherman was born in West Rupert, Vermont, on December 3, 1853. He obtained a teaching certificate at the Oswego Normal School (now SUNY Oswego) in Oswego, New York. He began as a teacher in Salem, New York and Wisconsin. He was then appointed principal of the Hamilton, New York Grade School for the 1873–74 term. Because of ill health, in 1874 he departed for the west and the Arizona Territory.

==Arizona – Early Accomplishments==

In 1873, territorial governor Anson P.K. Safford offered Sherman a teaching post at the public school in Prescott. Here, Sherman initiated the first graded school in Arizona, teaching there from 1874 to 1876. In 1876, a new two-story school opened with Sherman as principal.

He was selected to represent Arizona at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, and returned to Arizona with his sister Lucy, who was also a teacher, and who met and married Eli P. Clark, then serving at the Arizona territorial auditor. Clark would become one of Sherman&#x27;s closest business associates.

John C. Frémont, then governor of the Arizona Territory, appointed Sherman State Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1879, where, as superintendent, he created the territorial school laws. In 1882, after Congress had appropriated land to support public education, Sherman selected the lands which helped to provide for the future University of Arizona.

He earned the title &quot;General&quot; after his 1883 appointment as Adjutant-General of the Territory of Arizona, in which position he served two terms. He would use the honorific &quot;General&quot; for the rest of his life.

During these years, he was also involved in business affairs. Over time, he invested in property in Prescott and built a hotel, The Sherman House. He also acquired shares in mines, grazing lands and cattle and, as Prescott and Arizona grew rapidly, he made a good deal of money from his enterprises.

==Arizona – Phoenix==

By the early 1880s he had refocused his efforts in the agricultural Salt River Valley area and Phoenix. He invested in and was involved with the building of the Arizona Canal, which, started in early 1883, would become the main irrigation canal for the valley.

In 1884, he co-founded and became president of the Valley Bank of Phoenix. He was a major stockholder and vice president of the Phoenix Water Company. He bought large quantities of real estate around Phoenix and became the largest taxpayer in Phoenix and one of the largest in the territory.

In 1887, he constructed a street railway, and, after merging it with several other lines, electrified the lines in 1893 and created the Phoenix Railway Company of Arizona, which he controlled until 1925, when the lines were sold to the city. In 1910 he built a line from Phoenix to Glendale to connect with the Santa Fe Railroad.
He was involved with moving the territorial capitol to Phoenix, and with his business associate, attorney M.E. Collins, he donated 10 acres of property for the new territorial capitol building in 1889.

==Developing Electric Rail Transportation in Los Angeles==

Prior to Sherman&#x27;s arrival in Los Angeles, the Santa Fe Railroad had built a line to Los Angeles in 1886, which caused a rate war with the Southern Pacific. While a short-lived real estate boom followed, the excitement created by the boom drew attention (and new residents) to the area. During his time in Arizona, Sherman had made many trips to Los Angeles and had become convinced that it had a great future.

Shortly after moving to Los Angeles in 1890, Sherman became a founding stockholder and director of the Los Angeles-based National Bank of California. He and brother-in-law Clark immediately became involved in the local transportation business.

The Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway - Prior to Sherman&#x27;s arrival in Los Angeles, various individual entrepreneurs had built several horse car lines, cable car lines and an initial electric line. Sherman, seeing promise in the new Sprague trolley technology, gained control of several street railway franchises, and immediately began to create a system based on this technology.

Sherman and Clark incorporated the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway Company (LACE) in November, 1890. Clark was made Vice President and General Manager.
They intended to acquire and construct a large number of electric railway lines connecting important parts of Los Angeles. They built lines west of the city on Pico Boulevard, to Westlake Park, and to Rosedale Cemetery; south on Central and Maple Avenues and to the University of Southern California and University Park; north and east to Highland Park and East Los Angeles (now Lincoln Park), to the Evergreen Cemetery, and to the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe depots.

In the beginning, LACE competed with an existing cable railway, the Pacific Railway. When the cable company became bankrupt in 1892 because it was not profitable, LACE purchased it. By 1893 LACE operated 35 miles of electric lines, 14 miles of horse-drawn lines, and 21 miles of cable lines.

In 1895, after the company missed bond payments, Sherman lost control of the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric, though he continued as a director and held a large stock interest in the company. The new company, now controlled by the bondholders, was renamed the Los Angeles Railway, and was sold to Henry Huntington and his associates in September, 1898, ultimately becoming the &quot;Yellow Car&quot; system.

The First Interurban Lines - While LACE was growing, Sherman and Clark began the first steps of what would become an interurban network. In April, 1894, after acquiring horsecar lines in Pasadena, they incorporated the Pasadena and Los Angeles Electric Railway Company, Southern California&#x27;s first interurban electric railway, which in May, 1895 connected their newly electrified lines in Pasadena to the LACE system serving Los Angeles.

In November, 1894, they incorporated another new interurban company, the Pasadena and Pacific Electric Railway Company, designed to connect Los Angeles to Santa Monica. After acquiring five existing railroads, they reconstructed an older steam line to reach from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica via Colegrove.

In 1896, at the junction of his Pasadena and Pacific streetcar line and what would become San Vicente Boulevard, just west of Hollywood, Sherman acquired 5.6 acres of land and built storage yards and car barns, naming the area Sherman. A town grew up around the facility which would evolve to become the city of West Hollywood.

The Los Angeles Pacific Railroad - After losing control of LACE, the pair focused their attention on expanding their lines between Los Angeles and the beaches. After losing control of the Los Angeles &amp; Pacific in 1897, in June, 1898 they reorganized their remaining lines into a new company, The Los Angeles-Pacific Railroad. Later, the Los Angeles and Pacific Railway was acquired by Henry Huntington and Isaias W. Hellman’s group of investors and become part of the Pacific Electric system.

Controversy arose over some of Sherman&#x27;s methods. The San Francisco Call ran a series of vitriolic articles during November and December 1898, which claimed Sherman’s efforts to secure financing for his electric railways led to the failure of two San Francisco banks. Sherman was soon vindicated, as the failures were actually the result of poor bank investments during the boom of the late 1880s, and of possible losses associated with the bonds of Los Angeles’ cable railway system.

Sherman and Clark now built lines covering the west side of the Los Angeles basin, and down the coast, from Los Angeles to Hollywood, Sawtelle, Westgate, Santa Monica, Ocean Park and Venice, and to Playa del Rey, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach.

In some cases rights of way were donated and in other cases bonuses were paid by property owners so the lines would pass through their property. For example, Hobart J. Whitley and other investors paid $15,000 to add a line through Hollywood. Santa Monica property owners Senator John P. Jones and Robert Symington Baker provided 225 acres of land near what would become Sawtelle. Sherman and Clark sold this property to Jones and R.C. Gillis to raise funds for the new railway.

At its peak the Los Angeles Pacific had 180 miles of track in the western portions of Los Angeles County, from Los Angeles to the beaches along Santa Monica bay, then running down the coast to Redondo Beach.

In March, 1906, Sherman and Clark sold a controlling interest in the railway to E. H. Harriman, of the Southern Pacific for a reported $6 million. A new Los Angeles Pacific Railroad Company was incorporated on April 4, 1907, with ambitious plans to standard gauge the system, add new lines, create a subway from downtown to Vineyard and more.

In 1910, Sherman and Clark sold the remaining interest in their Los Angeles Pacific Railroad to the Southern Pacific, which, in September, 1911, combined their lines with Huntington&#x27;s original Pacific Electric Railway and several other companies into a new Pacific Electric Railway. Sherman remained on the board of the Pacific Electric Railway.

==Early Real Estate Development Activities in Los Angeles==

Sherman was adept as using the electric railway to promote real estate investments. Through the creation of the Los Angeles Pacific lines, Sherman and Clark were key to the development of communities between Los Angeles and the coast, and of the area of the coast from Santa Monica to Redondo Beach. Their LAP Railroad featured the famous Balloon Route, an excursion that left Los Angeles and took a balloon-shaped rail trip involving stops at popular locations between Los Angeles and the ocean and then back to Los Angeles. The Balloon Route was popular with tourists and was instrumental in introducing potential homebuyers to the area. Sherman&#x27;s work with the LAP was intimately tied to land acquisition, both as part of the construction of the rail lines, and as a means to promote the various real estate investments in which Sherman and Clark were involved.

In 1900, along with developers Baker and Burbank, they purchased 1,500 acres in Hermosa Beach. Their Hermosa Beach Land and Water Company provided water; the developers built the first boardwalk and pier in 1901 and 1904. Initially served by the Santa Fe Railway, in mid-1904, the community would be served by LAP&#x27;s new Redondo Division car line. 
In addition, in 1903 Sherman and Clark purchased 200 acres north of Hermosa Beach and named it Shakespeare Beach, intending that it be a writer&#x27;s colony, but was unable to attract many writers. Several streets, such as Homer Street and Longfellow Avenue, remain from this original subdivision.

Sherman became associated with several prominent businessmen over the years in ever-larger projects. This list of men included Harrison Gray Otis, Harry Chandler, Otto F. Brant, Hobart J. Whitley, Robert C. Gillis and others. The first such project concerned the development of Hollywood.

In 1900, the LAP had built a line north of its Santa Monica Boulevard line in Colegrove which ran along Prospect Boulevard (now Hollywood Boulevard), assisted by a $25,000 bonus paid by Hobart J. Whitley, Col. Griffith J. Griffith, and P.J. Beveridge. In 1901 Whitley and Sherman created the Los Angeles-Pacific Boulevard Development Company, which organized a syndicate that bought and subdivided a 480-acre area in Hollywood, a development which Whitley called the Hollywood Ocean Vista Tract. The company built curbs and sidewalks, planted shrubbery, and donated land for a bank and for the future Hollywood Hotel.

In 1902, Sherman and a syndicate of fifteen men purchased 1,000 acres of land around the Ballona lagoon and Port Ballona under the name the Beach Land Company, renaming the area Playa del Rey. The syndicate included partners such as local landowners Robert C. Gillis, Frederick H. Rindge, and others. They built a $100,000 pavilion, the Hotel Del Rey, and a boathouse and grandstands around the lagoon. Sherman and Clark&#x27;s Los Angeles, Redondo Beach and Hermosa Railway Company built a line to the area by, which was later merged into the LAP. The line opened December 1902, extending from downtown at 4th &amp; Broadway to the new resort, and was soon added to the famous “Balloon Route” excursion. Many visitors bought lots and built homes along the beach front.

In 1905, Sherman and Clark extended a line in the center of San Vicente Boulevard, past Robert C. Gillis’ Westgate tract (now the Brentwood area, where Sherman had investments, then on to Santa Monica.

==Later Real Estate Activities==

In July, 1905, Sherman and Clark had purchased 640 acres in upper Beachwood Canyon, which at first they used as a rock quarry. With Los Angeles’ rapid growth in the early 1920s, especially in the film industry, they partnered with Harry Chandler and developer S.H. Woodruff in 1923, and developed and promoted the property, which they named Hollywoodland. A large, lighted sign was built that would call attention to their development. That sign, completed in July, 1923, was rebuilt after World War II. With the “land” part removed, it now reads “Hollywood”.

Chandler and Sherman were the primary investors, in a syndicate of 70, who in 1911 purchased the Tejon Ranch, a 270,000 acre ranch along the Kern County-Los Angeles County border, from Truxtun Beale.

And, while not one of the original purchasers, in 1906 Sherman invested in the Colorado River Land Company, a Mexican Corporation with 842,000 acres in the Mexican counterpart of the Imperial Valley. The investments in this ranch are credited with an economic boom in northern Baja California.
Sherman also acquired much property in Culver City.

==The Water Commissioner, the Aqueduct, and the San Fernando Valley==

Sherman was appointed to the Board of Water Commissioners February 5, 1903 by mayor Meredith P. Snyder, where he worked on the Owens River project and became embroiled in controversy.

In the early 1900s, Los Angeles was looking for additional water sources to support its growing population. In late 1904, former mayor Fred Eaton, and water department engineer William Mulholland had travelled to the Inyo Valley, where Eaton showed Mulholland how water from the Owens River could be acquired and transported to Los Angeles. In 1904, the Board of Water Commissioners was notified of the purchases of water rights in the Owens Valley for the proposed aqueduct to Los Angeles.

In September 1903, before the aqueduct plan was conceived, a syndicate led by L.C. Brand had purchased an option on the 16,500-acre George K. Porter Ranch in the northeastern San Fernando Valley. The syndicate included Porter, railroad builders Henry E. Huntington and E. H. Harriman, newspaper publishers Harrison Gray Otis, Harry Chandler, and Edwin T. Earl, banker Joseph Francis Sartori and others. Brand, along with Huntington, purchased the ranch to run an electric line to it and then to subdivide it, as he had done in Glendale.

Shortly after Eaton&#x27;s report regarding the possible aqueduct was given to the water commissioners, the syndicate took up the option on Porter Ranch. William Randolph Hearst’s paper, the Examiner, alleged that Sherman, after hearing the news of the aqueduct through his position on the water board, informed his business friends, who then completed their purchase of the ranch. Several historians note that, while this is possible, there was never any concrete evidence that this was the case.

A second syndicate was formed in September, 1909, two years after construction of the aqueduct had begun in 1907. This group of men purchased the parcel from the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company, owned by Isaac Newton Van Nuys and son-in-law Issac Lankershim for $2,500,000, or just under $53 an acre. The 30-person syndicate was led by a five-member Board of Control which included Sherman and partners Hobart Johnstone Whitley, General Harrison Gray Otis, Otto F. Brant, and Harry Chandler, manager of the Los Angeles Times, The land, also known as Tract 1000, comprised nearly the entire southern half of the San Fernando Valley south of present-day Roscoe Blvd.

Sherman’s Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, now under Southern Pacific control, began surveying a route over the Cahuenga Pass to the Valley in 1909. By 1912, after the syndicate paid a $150,000 bonus to help with construction, the Pacific Electric Railway completed the new San Fernando Valley Line, a extension of the PE, which ran from Hollywood to the developments of the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company. An additional line was extended to San Fernando in 1913.

Along with the streetcar line, the group built a &quot;$500,000 boulevard&quot; named Sherman Way, which was important to the success of the development. By 1912, 45-minute streetcar service from Van Nuys to downtown and the &quot;no speed limit&quot; paved road were key selling points.

They group laid out three communities: the townsite of Van Nuys in 1911, the mid-valley townsite of Marion (present-day Reseda) and the townsite of Owensmouth (present-day Canoga Park) in 1912.
As part of his participation, Sherman retained 1,000 acres around the area of Ventura and Sepulveda Boulevards in what later became the neighborhood of Sherman Oaks, named for him.

Sherman was removed from the Water Board in January, 1910, by mayor George Alexander, ostensibly because a department related to the aqueduct leased space in a building he held stock in, violating a municipal ordinance.

==Other Activities==

He was a director in the Farmers &amp; Merchants National Bank, the Yosemite Park and Curry Company and a number of other corporations.

In 1903, Sherman became one of the incorporators of Frederick H. Rindge’s Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway, which Rindge built as a means of blocking the creation of a railroad or other throughway along the shore of his Malibu Ranch.

After the San Francisco earthquake, Sherman arranged a train of volunteers and medical supplies from Los Angeles to San Francisco. It was the first train to reach San Francisco after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

After the end of World War I, he saw a need for steamship service and helped to form (and later became president of) the Los Angeles Steamship Company. The company&#x27;s ships Harvard and Yale sailed between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the City of Los Angeles and City of Honolulu sailed to Hawaii. After the Matson line opened a competing line and the City of Honolulu was destroyed by fire, the company was sold to the Matson Company in 1930.

==Personal life==
He married Harriet Emily Pratt, daughter of Robert H. Pratt, a leading figure in the Central Pacific Railway of San Francisco. They married in 1885 and had two daughters, Hazeltine and Lucy; Sherman also adopted Harriet&#x27;s son Robert Pierce from a previous marriage. Sherman and his wife separated and were divorced in 1908. He never remarried. For many years he lived and worked in the Westminster Hotel until the late 1920s, after which he moved into an apartment suite on Rampart Boulevard near 6th. He also had a house on Bay Island, Newport Beach, where he died September 9, 1932.

Sherman left an estate of several million dollars, leaving sizable sums to the University of Southern California, Pomona College, the California Institute of Technology and Grinnell College, Iowa.

==Legacy==

Sherman Foundation and Sherman Library &amp; Gardens - Sherman&#x27;s close personal assistant, Arnold D. Haskell, who started working for Sherman almost 20 years before Sherman&#x27;s death, established the Sherman Foundation in 1951. Headquartered in Corona del Mar, it is home to a garden and a research library. The Foundation has contributed to hospitals, youth groups, scientific research, the Los Angeles Music Center and more.

Sherman Way - The entire grand road built by the Suburban Homes Company was originally named &quot;Sherman Way&quot; in his recognition. The name remains on the westernmost original segment from Canoga Park and West Hills to Sherman Circle at Van Nuys Boulevard, and now also extends to Burbank. The easternmost original segment, with its electric railway right of way now a landscaped median/Orange Line route, survives as present-day Chandler Boulevard. The north–south original segment, as present-day Van Nuys Boulevard in Van Nuys, connects Chandler Boulevard to Sherman Circle. Hazeltine Avenue, which runs north–south from Sherman Oaks to Panorama City, was named after his daughter Hazeltine.

Sherman Oaks -

Hollywoodland and the Hollywood Sign -

Various communities on the westside - including West Hollywood, Playa del Rey, Hermosa Beach

<doc id="851455" wikidata="Q412194" url="?curid=851455" title="Buspirone">
<text>Buspirone, sold under the brand name Buspar among others, is an anxiolytic, a medication primarily used to treat anxiety disorders, particularly generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, increasing action at serotonin receptors in the brain. It is taken orally and takes two to six weeks to be fully effective.

Common side effects of buspirone include nausea, headaches, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating. Serious side effects may include movement disorders, serotonin syndrome, and seizures. Its use in pregnancy appears to be safe but has not been well studied, and use during breastfeeding has not been well studied either.

Buspirone was developed in 1968 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 54th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
===Anxiety===
Buspirone is used for the short-term and long-term treatment of anxiety disorders or symptoms of anxiety. It is generally preferred over benzodiazepines because it does not activate the receptors that make drugs like alprazolam addictive.

Buspirone has no immediate anxiolytic effects, and hence has a delayed onset of action; its full clinical effectiveness may require 2–4 weeks to manifest itself. The drug is similarly effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to benzodiazepines including diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, and clorazepate. Buspirone is not known to be effective in the treatment of other anxiety disorders besides GAD.

===Other uses===

====Sexual dysfunction====
There is some evidence that buspirone on its own may be useful in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women. Buspirone may also be effective in treating antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.

====Miscellaneous====
Buspirone is not effective as a treatment for benzodiazepine withdrawal, barbiturate withdrawal, or alcohol withdrawal.

SSRI and SNRI antidepressants such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, respectively, may cause jaw pain/jaw spasm reversible syndrome, although it is not common, and buspirone appears to be successful in treating antidepressant-induced bruxism.

==Contraindications==
Buspirone has these contraindications:
* Hypersensitivity to buspirone
*Metabolic acidosis, as in diabetes
* Should not be used with MAO inhibitors
* Severely compromised liver and/or kidney function

==Side effects==
Known side effects associated with buspirone include dizziness, headaches, nausea, tinnitus, and paresthesia. Buspirone is relatively well tolerated and is not associated with sedation, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, muscle relaxation, physical dependence, or anticonvulsant effects. In addition, buspirone does not produce euphoria and is not a drug of abuse.

==Overdose==
Buspirone appears to be relatively benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, buspirone was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375 mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400 mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250 mg and up to 300 mg buspirone have resulted in drowsiness in about 50% of individuals. One death has been reported in a co-ingestion of 450 mg buspirone with alprazolam, diltiazem, alcohol, and cocaine.

== Interactions ==

Buspirone has been shown &quot;in vitro&quot; to be metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4. This finding is consistent with the &quot;in vivo&quot; interactions observed between buspirone and these inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), among others:

* Itraconazole: Increased plasma level of buspirone
* Rifampicin: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone
* Nefazodone: Increased plasma levels of buspirone
* Haloperidol: Increased plasma levels of buspirone
* Carbamazepine: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone
* Grapefruit: Significantly increases the plasma levels of buspirone. See grapefruit–drug interactions.
*Fluvoxamine: Moderately increased plasma levels of buspirone.

Elevated blood pressure has been reported when buspirone has been administered to patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Buspirone acts as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor with high affinity. It is a partial agonist of both presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. It is thought that the main effects of buspirone are mediated via its interaction with the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor, thus reducing the firing of serotonin-producing neurons. Buspirone also seems to have lower affinities for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 receptors where it probably acts as an antagonist.

In addition to binding to serotonin receptors, buspirone is an antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor with weak affinity. It preferentially blocks inhibitory presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, and antagonizes postsynaptic D2 receptors only at higher doses. In accordance, buspirone has been found to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway at low doses, whereas at higher doses, postsynaptic D2 receptors are blocked and antidopaminergic effects such as hypoactivity and reduced stereotypy, though notably not catalepsy, are observed in animals. Buspirone has also been found to bind with much higher affinity to the dopamine D3 and D4 receptors, where it is similarly an antagonist.

A major metabolite of buspirone, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), occurs at higher circulating levels than buspirone itself and is known to act as a potent α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist. This metabolite may be responsible for the increased noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity observed with buspirone in animals. Buspirone also has very weak and probably clinically unimportant affinity for the α1-adrenergic receptor. However, buspirone has been reported to have shown &quot;significant and selective intrinsic efficacy&quot; at the α1-adrenergic receptor expressed in a &quot;tissue- and species-dependent manner&quot;.

Unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone does not interact with the GABAA receptor complex.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Buspirone has a low oral bioavailability of 3.9% relative to intravenous injection due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The time to peak plasma levels following ingestion is 0.9 to 1.5 hours. It is reported to have an elimination half-life of 2.8 hours, although a review of 14 studies found that the mean terminal half-life ranged between 2 and 11 hours, and one study even reported a terminal half-life of 33 hours. Buspirone is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and prominent drug interactions with inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme have been observed. Major metabolites of buspirone include 5-hydroxybuspirone, 6-hydroxybuspirone, 8-hydroxybuspirone, and 1-PP. 6-Hydroxybuspirone has been identified as the predominant hepatic metabolite of buspirone, with plasma levels that are 40-fold greater than those of buspirone after oral administration of buspirone to humans. The metabolite is a high-affinity partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki=25 nM) similarly to buspirone, and has demonstrated occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor &quot;in vivo&quot;. As such, it is likely to play an important role in the therapeutic effects of buspirone. 1-PP has also been found to circulate at higher levels than those of buspirone itself and may similarly play a significant role in the clinical effects of buspirone.

==Chemistry==
Buspirone is a member of the azapirone chemical class, and consists of azaspirodecanedione and pyrimidinylpiperazine components linked together by a butyl chain.

===Analogues===
Structural analogues of buspirone include other azapirones like gepirone, ipsapirone, perospirone, and tandospirone.

A number of analogues are recorded.

===Synthesis===
A number of methods of synthesis have also been reported. One method begins with alkylation of 1-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine (1) with 3-chloro-1-cyanopropane (4-chlorobutyronitrile) (2) to give (3). Next, reduction of the nitrile group is performed either by catalytic hydrogenation or with lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) giving (4). The primary amine is then reacted with 3,3-tetramethyleneglutaric anhydride (5) in order to yield buspirone (6).

==History==
Buspirone was first synthesized by a team at Mead Johnson in 1968 but was not patented until 1980. It was initially developed as an antipsychotic acting on the D2 receptor but was found to be ineffective in the treatment of psychosis; it was then used as an anxiolytic instead. In 1986, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained FDA approval for buspirone in the treatment of GAD. The patent expired in 2001, and buspirone is now available as a generic drug.

==Society and culture==
===Generic names===
Buspirone is the , , , and of buspirone, while buspirone hydrochloride is its , , and .

===Brand names===
Buspirone was primarily sold under the brand name Buspar. Buspar is currently listed as discontinued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2010, in response to a citizen petition, the FDA determined that Buspar was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness.

<text>Ernest Lapointe (October 6, 1876 – November 26, 1941) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. A member of Parliament from Quebec City, he was a senior minister in the government of Prime Minister W. L. Mackenzie King, playing an important role on issues relating to legal affairs, Quebec and French-speaking Canada.

==Education, early career==
Lapointe earned his law degree from Laval University. He was called to the bar in 1898 and practiced law in Rivière-du-Loup and Quebec City.

==Enters politics==
Lapointe was elected by acclamation to the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Kamouraska as a Liberal through a by-election on February 12, 1904. Lapointe was later re-elected in the 1904, 1908, 1911, and 1917 federal elections.

Lapointe resigned his seat in 1919 and successfully ran in the Quebec East seat vacated by former Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who died.

==King&#x27;s cabinet minister and Quebec lieutenant==

In 1921, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King appointed Lapointe to his cabinet as minister of marine and fisheries. During his tenure as minister, Lapointe reduced tariffs. In 1924, Lapointe became minister of justice, and served in that position until the Liberals&#x27; defeat at the polls in 1930. However, the Liberals under King returned back to power in the 1935 federal election, and Lapointe once again regained his old post. From 1924 to 1930 as justice minister, Lapointe expressed his support for King&#x27;s commitment to Canadian autonomy and accompanied him at the Imperial Conference of 1926. Lapointe also chaired the Canadian delegation in the discussions that led to the Statute of Westminster in 1931.

Lapointe served as King&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant and was one of the most important ministers in Cabinet. King did not speak French; he relied on Lapointe to handle important matters in the province. Lapointe gave a strong Quebecker voice to the cabinet decision, something that had not existed since the defeat of Laurier in 1911.

In the late 1930s, Lapointe recommended that the federal Cabinet disallow several Acts passed by the Alberta Social Credit government of William Aberhart, arguing that Aberhart was attempting to grab too much power and encroach upon federal jurisdiction.

Lapointe did not recommend disallowance of the Padlock Act passed by the Quebec government of Maurice Duplessis, fearing that doing so would only aid the Union Nationale government.

===Conscription issue===

Lapointe helped draft Mackenzie King&#x27;s policy against conscription for overseas service in 1939, and his campaigning helped defeat the Duplessis provincial government in 1939. During the 1939 provincial election, Lapointe made many speeches in the province of Quebec, in which he argued that if Duplessis was to be re-elected, every French Canadian minister would resign from the federal cabinet, leaving it without a francophone voice. Having been a Liberal MP during the 1917 conscription crisis, Lapointe knew how much a new crisis like the last one would destroy the national unity that Mackenzie King had tried to build since 1921. Duplessis lost in a landslide to Liberal Party of Quebec leader Adélard Godbout, who sought to co-operate with the federal government.

==Death==
Lapointe died in office in 1941, in the midst of the war. King decided to appoint the reluctant Quebec leading lawyer Louis St. Laurent to the cabinet as the new minister of justice.

Lapointe&#x27;s son, Hugues Lapointe, served as a member of parliament from 1940 to 1957 and lieutenant governor of Quebec from 1966 to 1978.

==History==
===Formation of predecessor units===
The Third Brigade of the Tennessee Militia was absorbed into the National Guard of the United States on 25 March 1887 as the 3rd Infantry Regiment, with headquarters in Knoxville. The 1st Battalion was located in Knoxville, and the 2nd Battalion was located in Chattanooga. In the spring of 1898, the battalions were consolidated to form the 6th Infantry Regiment. Between 18 and 20 May 1898, the 6th Infantry was re-designated as the 3rd Tennessee Volunteer Infantry Regiment..

===Spanish–American War===
The 3rd Tennessee was mustered into federal service from 18–20 May 1898 at Camp Dewy, Nashville, for the war with Spain. The 3rd Tennessee was deployed to Tampa, Florida, and later mustered out of federal service at Anniston, Alabama, on 31 January 1899. It was reorganized in Knoxville in the Tennessee National Guard as the 6th Infantry Regiment. In 1903, the 6th Infantry Regiment was redesignated once again as the 3rd Infantry Regiment.

===Mexican Punitive Expedition===
On 3 July 1916, the 3rd Infantry Regiment was mustered into federal service at Nashville and deployed to Eagle Pass, Texas, to take part in the Army&#x27;s pursuit of the Mexican bandit Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa along the Mexico-U.S. border. They returned home and were mustered out of federal service on 14 March 1917.

===World War I===
Four months after returning from Texas, on 24 July 1917, the 3rd Infantry Regiment was mustered into federal service and assigned as an element of the 30th Division. On 3 August, the War Department ordered concentration and organization of the units designated to form the division at Camp Sevier, Greenville, South Carolina. On 5 August 1917 the 3rd Tennessee Infantry Regiment was &quot;drafted&quot; into federal service. Concentration continued throughout August 1917.

The 30th Division (the &quot;Old Hickory&quot; Division, named after President Andrew Jackson of Tennessee) was reorganized in accordance with the tables of organization of 8 August 1917. On 12 September 1917 infantry brigades were organized in the 30th Division. The 59th Infantry Brigade was composed of the 3rd Tennessee and the 1st South Carolina Regiments of Infantry, and detachments of the 1st North Carolina and 2nd South Carolina Regiments of Infantry, and the Tennessee Cavalry. The 60th Infantry Brigade included, the 2nd and 3rd North Carolina Regiments of Infantry, and detachments of the 1st North Carolina and 2nd Tennessee Regiments of Infantry and of North Carolina Cavalry. On 14 September 1917 the 3rd Tennessee Infantry Regiment was reorganized and re-designated as the 117th Infantry Regiment assigned to the 30th Division.

The 30th Division underwent systematic training from 17 September until 30 April 1918. During October 1917, Selective Service men from Camps Gordon, Jackson and Pike completed the regiment and filled out the rest of the division.

The 117th Infantry Regiment as part of the 59th Brigade, 30th Infantry Division received its first taste of war on 9 July 1918. With the 27th (US) Division, it was assigned to the organization and defense of the East Poperinghe Line, a third defensive position in the Dickebusch Lake and Scherpenberg Sectors. The 30th Division on 11 July 1918 assumed full responsibility for the East Poperinghe trench system.

Affiliated with the British, 117th Infantry Regiment as part of the 30th Division reached the front lines for training on 16 July 1918 and remained until 18 August. Actual training was carried until 9 August. The 117th Infantry Regiment and the rest of the 59th Infantry Brigade remained with the British 3rd (GB) Division, while the machine gun and infantry units served by battalions and other divisional troops by detachments remained with 30th Division.

After a brief return to the rear for further training, the 30th Division relieved the 3rd (GB) Division in the front line of the Canal Sector from the vicinity of Elzenwalle to the railroad southeast of Transport Fme on the nights of 16 and 17 August 1918. On 18 August 1918 the 30th Division (US) assumed command, with the 6th (GB) Division to its right. On the next day the Canal Sector occupation was merged into the Ypres-Lys Operation.

From 19 August until 4 September 30 (US) Division, less Artillery and 105th Ammunition Trains took part in the Ypres- Lys Operation. 26 August – 11 September rumors of a German withdrawal of troops was investigated. 31 August combat patrols of the 30th (US) Division determined that the Germans were withdrawing. The next day, the 59th Infantry Brigade leading, the division captured Moated Orange, Voormezeele, Lock No. 8, and Lankhof Fme, and occupied a line connecting these localities with the original front at Gunners&#x27; Lodge. The 27th (US) Division served to the right, the 14th (GB) Division to the left.

On the nights of 3 through 5 September, the 30th Division (US) was relieved by the 35th (GB) Division, and on 4 September, the command passed. The 30th (US) Division concentrated near Proven on 5 September and 6, and moved into the St. Pol Area, in the zone of the British First Army on 7 September for training.

Meanwhile, on 12–15 September, the 37th Infantry Division, along with the two 30th Division units, occupied the Avocourt Sector on 23–25 September 1918.

The 30th (US) Division, less artillery, and the 105th Ammunition Train participated in the Somme Offensive Operation 22 September – 1 October. On the nights of 21 to 24 September 1918, the 30th (US) Division moved to the Tincourt-Boucly (British Fourth Army) Area, where the Second Corps was affiliated with the Australian 1st Division, east of Villeret and Hargicourt. The lines extended from 300 meters east of Buisson-Gaulaine Fme, through La Haute Bruyere, la Terrasse Trench, Bois des Tuyas, Boyeu du Chevreau, to Malakoff Fme. The 59th Infantry Brigade occupied the forward area. Command passed to the 30th (US) Division on 24 September 1918.

On 26–27 September 30 (US) Division attacked from a line of departure between 300 and 400 meters east of the line between La Haute Bruyere and Malakoff Fme, with the 46th (GB) Division on the right, and the 27th (US) Division on the left. On the night of 27 September and 28, the 60th Infantry Brigade relieved the 59th Infantry Brigade and the 117th Infantry Regiment.

On 29 September 1918 the 30th (US) Division with the 59th and 60th Infantry Brigades in the lead, battered through the formidable Hindenburg Line. Immediately after the penetration, the 30th Division crossed the canal and captured Bellicourt, then entered Nauroy. It was at Bellicourt, France, that the 30th Division smashed its way through the &quot;Hindenburg Line&quot;, a victory that hastened the close of the war.

The 5th Division (Australia) moved up to pass through the 30th (US) Division, and both divisions advanced to establish a front from the intersection of Wattling Street road and canal, east and northeast to Bois du Cabaret, 800 meters northeast of the Boise de Malakoff. The next day the command passed to the Australian 5th Division, but units of the 30th (US) Division, which were in line, participated until noon.

Returning to the front the 117th Infantry as part of the 59th Infantry Brigade and other units moved to the Tincourt-Boucly Area.

On the night of 5 and 6 October 1918 the 59th Infantry Brigade took position in support near Hargicourt and Bellicourt. The next day the 59th Infantry Brigade attacked to realign the front.

The 30th (US) Division on 8 October, assisted by tanks had the 59th Infantry Brigade and one battalion from the 60th Infantry Brigade, leading, attacked northeast, and captured Brancourt-le-Grand and Premont, and reached a line from the Fme de la Piete to the eastern outskirts of Premont. The 6th (GB) Division served on the right, while the 25th (GB) Division was on the left. The 60th Infantry Brigade passed through the 59th on 9 October, and captured Busigny and Becquigny. The next day the division front extended along the western outskirts of Vaux-Andigny, through La Haie-Menneresse, and St. Souplet, to St. Benin.

During this advance on 7 October 1918 Sergeant Edward R. Talley, from Russellville, Tennessee, Company L, 117th Infantry Regiment near Ponchaux, France, was undeterred by seeing several comrades killed in attempting to put a hostile machinegun nest out of action. He attacked the position single-handed, armed only with his Springfield 03 rifle. Sergeant Talley rushed the machinegun nest in the face of intense enemy fire, killed or wounded at least 6 of the crew, and silenced the gun. When the enemy attempted to bring forward another gun and ammunition Sergeant Talley drove them back by effective fire from his rifle. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

The next day, Sergeant James Ernest Karnes from Knoxville, and Private Calvin John Ward from Morristown, Company D, 117th Infantry Regiment near Estrees, France, on 8 October 1918 were taking part in a general advance. Their company was held up by a machinegun, which was enfilading the line of troops. These two soldiers &quot;had all they could take&quot; so they fixed their bayonets and charged the machine gun position and succeeded in destroying the machine gun nest by killing 3 and capturing 7 of the enemy and their guns. Sergeant Karnes and Private Ward were both awarded the Medal of Honor for this action.

On 11 October, the 30th (US) Division occupied Vaux-Andigny, La Haie-Menneresse, and reached the northwestern outskirts of St. Martin-Riviere, its front extending north along the West Bank of the La Selle River to St. Benin. It was relieved during the night of 11/12 October and 1918 by the 27th (US) Division, and rested near Premont, Brancourt-le-Grand, and Monibrehain. Command passed on 12 October 1918.

The 30th (US) Division returned to the line on the night of 15/16 October 1918. The 59th Infantry Brigade relieved the 54th Infantry Brigade (27th Division), in the right sector of the II Corps from Vaux-Andigny to one-half kilometer west of St. Martin-Riviere. The 6th (GB) Division on the right, 27th Division (US) on the left. On 17 October 30 (US) Division attacked northeast, crossing the La Selle River, captured Molain and established a line from three-quarters kilometer north of La Demi-Lieue to l&#x27;Arbre-de-Guise. The next day Ribeauville was occupied. The front extended from Rejet-de-Beaulieu to three-quarters kilometer southeast of la Jonquiere Fme, on 19 October 1918.

The 30th (US) Division was relieved by the 1st (GB) Division on the night of 19/20 October and moved, 20–23 October to the vicinity of Tincourt-Boucly and Roisel. The division moved to Querrieu Area on 23 October 1918 for rehabilitation and training.

The 117th Infantry moved back to the United States after the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 and was demobilized during 13–17 April 1919 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia near Chattanooga.

In 1921, a monument to the 117th Infantry was erected in front of the old Knoxville High School on the corner of E 5th Ave NE &amp; Lamar St NE. It consists of a charging soldier with raised fist and rifle. Several plaques around the base honor the soldiers killed in action and list accomplishments of the regiment.

===Interwar period===
The 117th Infantry Regiment arrived at the port of Charleston on 27 March 1919 on the troopship USS Pocahontas and was demobilized 17 April 1919 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. Per the National Defense Act of 1920, the 117th Infantry was reconstituted in the National Guard in 1921, assigned to the 30th Division, and allotted to the state of Tennessee. It was reorganized on 30 April 1921 by consolidation with the 4th Infantry, Tennessee National Guard (headquarters organized 28 April 1918 and federally recognized at Chattanooga, Tennessee) and redesignation as the 117th Infantry. Federal recognition was withdrawn on 15 October 1921; the headquarters was relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, and federally recognized on 24 April 1923, and relocated 1 October 1933 to Jackson, Tennessee. The regiment, or elements thereof, were called up to perform the following state duties: two companies performed escort duty in connection with protecting civil prisoners at Springfield, Tennessee, 21 July 1932; flood relief duties along the Arkansas River near Memphis, Tennessee, in January 1937; 1st Battalion for riot control at a workers strike at Alcoa, Tennessee, 7–14 July 1937; riot control at the Democratic Party primary election in Memphis, Tennessee, 30 July 1938.

===World War II===
On 16 September 1940, the 117th Infantry Regiment was inducted into federal service at home stations for a period of one year. The regiment was moved by train and arrived at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 24 September 1940. The regiment was housed in pyramidal tents at Fort Jackson. Colonel Grant A. Schlieker assumed command of the regiment on 12 August 1940. In October 1940, the unit was brought to war strength with Selective Service men, primarily from the Knoxville area.

The 117th Infantry moved by motor convoy to Dixie, Tennessee, on 27 May 1941 for the VII Corps Tennessee Maneuvers. The regiment returned to Fort Jackson on 5 July 1941.The regiment then moved to Chester, South Carolina, on 27 September 1941 for both the October and November 1941 Carolina Maneuvers. The 117th Infantry Regiment as part of the 30th Division returned to Fort Jackson on 29 November 1941, where the 30th Division was redesigned as the 30th Infantry Division. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the term of service of the regiment, along with the rest of the National Guard soldiers inducted in 1940-1941, was extended for the duration of the war. 

On 16 February 1942, two months after American entry into World War II, the 30th Infantry Division arrived at Camp Blanding, Florida, for extensive infantry training. On 12 September 1942, the 117th Infantry Regiment was ordered to the Infantry School, located at Fort Benning, Georgia, to furnish troops for demonstration purposes and to assist instructors in the training of officer classes at the Officer Candidate School (OCS). The 117th Infantry Regiment moved back to Camp Blanding, Florida, by motor convoy on 28 February 1943 to conduct training designed to physically harden the troops.

They moved on 30 May 1943 to Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Starting on 4 September 1943, the regiment participated in the Second Army No. 3 Tennessee Maneuvers. On 7 September 1943 the 117th Infantry Regiment returned to Camp Forrest, near Tullahoma, Tennessee.

The 117th Infantry Regiment arrived at Camp Atterbury, Indiana, on 14 November 1943 to complete their final phase of training. The 117th Infantry Regiment departed Camp Atterbury and arrived at the staging area at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts, on 29 January 1944. The regiment departed from the Port of Boston on the troopship USS &quot;John Ericsson&quot; on 12 February 1944. The 117th Infantry Regiment disembarked in Liverpool, England, on 24 February 1944.

In England, from 25 February, to 5 April 1944 the regiment was quartered in Nissen huts near Petworth, England, and undertook extensive Infantry training. From 6 April to 9 June 1944, the regiment was billeted in the town of Berkhamsted, England, and completed their final training before entering combat in Normandy.

On &quot;D-Day&quot; 6 June 1944 the regiment was alerted for movement to France. The regiment moved to a staging area in southern England, where a briefing was given on the general situation, then moved to the Southampton docks for loading.

The 117th Infantry Regiment crossed the English Channel and landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy on D+4, 10 June 1944. The regiment initially moved into a staging area near Lison, France. The regiment remained here until 2 July 1944. The first casualties of World War II were suffered here as a result of German 88 mm fire on the staging area. The regiment&#x27;s initial mission was to replace some units of the 29th Division which had been almost immediately lost on D-Day. The balance of the 30th Infantry Division went into Normandy and was almost immediately committed to action against the German Army.

The 117th Infantry Regiment attacked across the Vire river along with the 120th Infantry at 04:30 am the morning of 7 July 1944 as part of the initial breakout from the Normandy Beachhead. They assaulted across the Vire-Taute Canal on 7 July 1944, establishing a bridgehead toward Les Landes, east of St Jean-de-Day, which the 3rd Armored Division passed through the regiment to conduct exploitation operations.

The regiment repulsed a major German counter-attack conducted by the German Panzer-Lehr-Division the night of 7 July 1944 and again during the morning of 9 July 1944. The Germans suffered heavy losses as the result of the Tennessee guardsmen&#x27;s tenacious fighting and accurate fire.

As the 117th Infantry advanced on Saint-Lô, as part of the 30th (US) Infantry Division, it checked a German counterattack along the main Hauts-Vents Highway 11 July 1944 and Pont Hebert fell after protracted fighting 14 July 1944. Patrols reached the Periers-Saint-Lô Road by 18 July 1944.

VII (US) Corps made the main effort along the St. Lo-Periers highway just west of Saint-Lô. The corps commander&#x27;s intent was to drive through the German crust-like defense before the Germans could reform, then exploit the break thought by passing mechanized forces into the Germans&#x27; rear. The plan called for saturation bombing by fighter-bombers, medium and heavy bombers from the front line back to the enemy&#x27;s artillery positions to disorient and dislodge the Germans. Following the bombers, 4th(US) Infantry Division, 9th (US) Infantry Division, and the 30th (US) Infantry Division were to attack southward along a narrow front, clearing the way for the 2d (US) and 3d (US) Armored Divisions and the 1st (US) Infantry Division to pass through. The armored forces were to sweep south then southwest into the rear of German forces opposing the VIII Corps along the western portions of the Cotentin Peninsula.

The 30th (US) Infantry Division attacked with the 120th Infantry Regiment on the right and 119th Infantry Division on the left. Two battalions from the 117th Infantry Regiment were attached (one battalion each) to the 119th and 120th Infantry Regiments. The remainder of the 117th Infantry was in division reserve prepared to pass through on the left and clear out the curve in the Vier River.

The air plan called for 350 fighter-bombers hitting the German front lines followed by 1,500 bombers assigned to targets deep and wide. As the friendly troops moved forward, another 396 medium bombers would bomb the rear areas for another 45 minutes. Friendly troops were moved back from their line of departures for safety.

After two postponements due to bad weather, the attack got underway on the morning of 24 July 1944. At 11:30 am, 350 P-47 fighter-bombers arrived on schedule and started dive-bombing, followed by the steady drone 1,500 heavy bombers. Some P-47 fighter-bombers bombed friendly troop positions and one squadron of heavy bombers dropped its bombs squarely on friendly troops. Twenty minutes after the attack started it was called off. &quot;Operation COBRA&quot; the breakout from St. Lo, the 30th Infantry Division endured the heaviest bombing by &quot;friendly aircraft&quot; of the entire war. Approximately 88 men were killed and over 500 seriously wounded over the two-day period. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, Commanding General Army Ground Forces, was visiting and observing this attack in the area of the Second Battalion, 120th Infantry, 30th Infantry Division when bombs instantly killed him dropped by friendly B-17s flying in support of Operation COBRA.

The two battalions of the 117th attacked with the units to which they were attached on 25 July 1944 to drive beyond Saint-Lô during Operation COBRA. On 26 July 1944 the 117th Infantry Regiment took the high ground overlooking Saint-Lô. The Armor and Infantry Forces passed through the hole in the German defenses and advanced south. The 30th Infantry Division had made a spectacular attack, and opened the way for Patton&#x27;s newly arrived Third Army to drive into Brittany and onward to Brest, France.

The division took well-defended Troisgots on 31 July 1944 and relieved the 1st Infantry Division near Mortain, France, on 6 August 1944. The 30th Infantry Division and the 117th Infantry Regiment was subjected to a strong German counterattack, which ruptured its lines in the area on the following day during the battle for Avranches.

In the morning of 6 August 1944, the regiment moved southwest to the vicinity of Bracy, France near Mortain to relieve the 26th Infantry and to take up defensive positions. At dusk, it was apparent the Germans were in the 1st Battalion&#x27;s area in strength. About 01:30 am, on 7 August 1944 the 117th Infantry Regiment was attacked by crack troops of the 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division. Between midnight and 04:00 the regiment was blanketed by intense and devastating mortar and artillery fire. Enemy aircraft strafed supporting Artillery units as they tried to register their fire on Germany tanks and infantry. The situation became critical at dawn when the main body of the Germans attacked in a thick fog and overran two company roadblocks. C Company of the 117th Infantry held their position, which caused the Germans to pause in their attack. Colonel Walter M. Johnson, the regimental commander issued orders to hold at all costs because there was nothing behind the 117th Infantry Regiment to stop the Germans from reaching the sea. A new defensive line was established on a sunken road bisected by the highway from Juvigny to Saint Barthelemy and situated on a hill overlooking Saint Barthelemy. Cooks, clerks, messengers, and administrative personnel from the battalions and the regimental headquarters became riflemen. The Tennessee Infantrymen held their positions against intense attacks by German infantry and armor.

Late in the afternoon of 8 August 1944, the Germans launched a fresh large-scale attack employing numerous tanks and fresh Infantry. Despite the terrible odds, the 117th Infantry Regiment stopped the German assault. Determined and stubborn Tennessee riflemen and machine gunners held their positions and stopped the German Infantrymen. Company B from Athens, Tennessee bore the brunt of the attack. Private Timothy L. Birt of Company B was a platoon runner and ended up as the runner for all the platoons. Through heavy enemy fire he carried orders, ammunition, rations and mail from the company command post to all the platoons. On six occasions he repaired telephone lines between the CP and the platoons. He helped evacuate seriously wounded soldiers from an open field under intense enemy fire. Twice he went with litter bearers to help evacuate the wounded. Once during the battle he served as observer and adjusted the company&#x27;s 60 mm mortar fire. Private Birt, from rural Meigs County, Tennessee was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his bravery.

During combat at Mortain and Saint-Barthelemy, the 117th Infantry Regiment and the 30th Infantry Division became known as the Workhorse of the Western Front. It was also known as &quot;Roosevelt&#x27;s SS Troops,&quot; so named by German high command because of the consistent vigor and pressure the division brought to bear on the elite 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division. According to three of Germany&#x27;s top generals interviewed after World War II, (Jodl, Keitel and von Kesslring) the battle for Mortain and Saint-Barthelemy was one of the two critical operations leading to the defeat of Germany in the west. Mainly the 1st Battalion, 117th Infantry at Saint-Barthelemy, absorbed the main drive of the Germany Army in Normandy, thus allowing Lieutenant General George Patton&#x27;s armored forces to race forward through France, thereby shortening the war by many months.

The 117th Infantry Regiment went over to the offensive again 11 August 1944 and forced back German gains to Mortain. The 117th Infantry Regiment along with the rest of the 30th (US) Infantry Division then pushed east behind the 2nd Armored Division, taking Nonancourt on 21 August 1944.

The 117th Infantry Regiment was moved by truck on 14 August to the vicinity of Rouelle near Domfront France. German artillery fired on the battalions of the regiment forcing them to dismount and move on foot to l’Onlay-l’Abbaye, France. Tennessee&#x27;s 117th Infantry Regiment crossed the Seine river near Mantes-Grassicourt west of Paris to relieve the 79th (US) Infantry Division, which had established a bridgehead across the Seine River. After two days of fighting the regiment was moving quickly in open country towards Belgium.

The 30th (US) Infantry Division (with the 117th Infantry Regiment) was the first American infantry division to enter Belgium 2 September 1944, and advanced over the Meuse River at Vise and Liège 11 September 1944. The 117th Infantry Regiment was the first Allied unit to enter the Netherlands on 13 September 1944.

On 14 September 1944 the 117th and 119th Infantry advanced into Maastricht east of the Meuse River where the 2d Battalion, 117th Infantry Regiment cleared the area west of the river.

The 117th Infantry Regiment attacked from Maastricht towards the German border in the vicinity of Scherpenseel Germany starting on the morning of 17 September 1944. Here German resistance intensified as the Germans employed 155 mm artillery against the regiment as they approached the border.

On the afternoon of 19 September 1944 the 1st Battalion crossed into Germany and entered the town of Scherpenseel. The next morning, the regiment planned the attack on the Siegfried Line, which the German claimed to be invincible fortress.

The 119th and 120th Infantry attacked toward the West Wall north of Aachen and the former reached positions commanding the Wurm River on 18 September 1944. The 30th Infantry Division attacked across the Rhine River between Aachen and Geilenkirchen 2 October 1944 against strong German opposition. On the following day the 117th Infantry Regiment seized Uebach after house-to-house fighting as the 119th Infantry finally captured Rimburg Castle.

At 11:00 hrs, 2 October 1944, the 117th Infantry, along with the rest of the 30th Infantry Division, launched an attack on the Siegfried Line near Palenberg, Germany. It was here that Private Harold G. Kiner from Aline, Oklahoma, of Company F, 117th Infantry Regiment won the Medal of Honor. With four other men, Private Kiner was leading a frontal assault on a Siegfried Line pillbox near Palenberg, Germany. Machinegun fire from the strongly defended enemy position away pinned down the attackers. The Germans threw hand grenades, one of which dropped between Private Kiner and two other men. With no hesitation, Private Kiner hurled himself upon the grenade, smothering the explosion. By his gallant action and voluntary sacrifice of his own life, he saved his two comrades from serious injury or death. The Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously to Private Kiner. Private Kiner was the fourth soldier from the regiment to be awarded the Medal of Honor.

The 117th Infantry Regiment was assisted by elements of the 2nd Armored Division as it continued with slow progress against the West Wall. The 1st Battalion of the 117th Infantry Regiment was the only lead battalion to crack the West Wall for the entire XIX Corps. The regiment&#x27;s advance was checked by a strong German counterattack on 9 October 1944 which isolated the 119th Infantry at North Wuerselen. The encirclement of Aachen was completed on 16 October 1944 when the 117th Infantry made contact with the 1st Infantry Division.

On 17 December 1944 the 117th Infantry Regiment was ordered to an assembly area in the vicinity of Hauset in the Belgian Ardennes. En route, the regiment was stopped by an assistant division commander and diverted to Malmedy and Stavelot to block a powerful German counterattack. As the regiment approached Stavelot it was noted that a German Panzer unit already occupied the town. Elements of the 117th Infantry were ordered to retake Stavelot, a key crossroads on the Amblève River. As they moved to their objectives, Axis Sally was on the radio that morning boasting of a huge counterattack though the Ardennes, which she said, could not possibly be stopped. She said &quot;The fanatical 30th Division, Roosevelt’s SS Troops, are en route to the rescue, but this time they will be completely annihilated!&quot; As the regiment approached the town of Stavelot, huge Tiger Royal (Mark VIb) tanks, and assault riflemen were observed in the center of town. The 1st Battalion of the regiment attacked and established a defensive position in the Town Square. The 1st Battalion was reinforced with tank destroyers, machineguns, and mortars. Late in the day, two American jeeps, and two half-ton trucks roared into Stavelot loaded with Germans dressed in American uniforms with guns blazing. The Tennesseans from the 117th quickly annihilated all the Germans captured and seized the jeeps and trucks.

It was determined that the Germans had occupied Stavelot with the 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division. This was the second time the 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division faced the 117th Infantry Regiment and the 30th Infantry Division during the Ardennes Offensive in the winter of 1944–45. The 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division, the main effort of the 1st SS Corps and the spearhead of the Sixth Panzer Army, gave up on their attempt to recapture Stavelot after the 117th Infantry Regiment repulsed six fanatical German assaults on 20 December 1944. Stavelot, like Mortain, was the key to the Sixth Panzer Army&#x27;s attack in the Ardennes. It was estimated that at least 1000 German dead lined the bank of the Amblève River which was mute testimony to the heroic actions of the 1st battalion, 117th Infantry Regiment. Again the 117th Infantry Regiment had defeated the elite 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division, which was never again to do battle.

The 117th Infantry Regiment moved into Germany and arrived in Varlautenheide, Germany at 2:00 am, 3 February 1945. On 19 February 1945 Major General Leland Hobbs, CG 30th Infantry Division, for the Saint-Barthelemy (Mortain) Performance awarded the Presidential Unit Citation the regiment for actions in France at Saint-Barthelemy. They were also awarded the Belgian Fourragere for its performance in the Ardennes and for the regiment&#x27;s part in the liberation of Belgium 4–10 September 1944.

On 23 February 1945 the 117th Infantry Regiment crossed the Roer River and continued to move into the heart of Germany. On 27 February 1945 elements of the 83d Infantry Division and the 2nd Armored Division passed through the regiment to exploit the Roer River breakthrough. The regiment spearheaded the Ninth Army&#x27;s crossing of the Rhine River at 02:00 hrs on 24 March 1945. They drove west into Stockum, Germany, then crossed the Autobahn and went on to Hunxe, Germany. They captured a German Airfield here on 27 March 1945. On 31 March 1945, the 117th Infantry Regiment captured the Lippe Canal, then motored to Brensteinfurt, Germany. Here they encountered a mass German surrender with German soldiers, hands up and running towards POW cages in the rear. Here they met the first of the streams of Allied prisoners, thin as skeletons, liberated from German prison camps along with laborers from Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and France.

During the month of April 1945, the regiment continued its dash to towards the east. At 06:00 on 7 April 1945 the 117th Infantry Regiment attacked and took the town of Hamelin, Germany. Hamelin is famous for the Brothers Grimm story of &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot; a children&#x27;s fairy tale. Here the regiment captured hundreds of German soldiers as prisoners of war.

On 17 April 1945 the regiment seized the city of Magdeburg on the Elbe River. The regiment moved east on the morning of 18 April 1945 and by noon had closed on the Elbe River where they were ordered to set up a defense and wait for the Red Army. The regiment waited for three weeks on the Russians and the end of the war. On 27 May 1945 British troops occupied Magdeburg and the 117th Infantry moved south to Oelsnitz and Bad Elster, Germany near the Czechoslovakian border for occupation. Plans were to transfer the regiment and the 30th Infantry Division to the Pacific Theater to fight the Japanese.

On 13 August 1945 the regiment boarded the Liberty Ship Marine Wolfe and sailed to Southampton, England. Before departing Southampton, news of the Japanese surrender canceled to the plans to move the regiment to the Pacific. On 17 August 1945 the regiment sailed on board the from the Ocean Pier at Southampton. They arrived at Pier 90 in New York City, the port of debarkation on 21 August 1945. The 117th Infantry Regiment moved to Fort Jackson on 21 August 1945, and was inactivated there from 17–24 November 1945.

===Cold War===

In a letter to the 30th Division commander in May 1946, the Supreme Allied Headquarters Army Historian Colonel S.L.A. Marshall called the 30th Infantry Division the &quot;Finest Infantry Division in the European Theater of Operations&quot;. Marshall wrote, &quot;It is the combined judgments of the approximately 35 historical officers who had worked on the records and in the field that the 30th merited this distinction. It was our finding that the 30th had been outstanding in three operations and we could consistently recommend it for citation on any of these occasions. It was further found that it had in no single instance performed discreditably or weakly ... and in no single operation had it carried less than its share of the burden or looked bad when compared to the forces on its flanks. We were especially impressed with the fact that it consistently achieved results without undue wastage of its men.&quot;

On 31 July 1946, the 117th was reorganized. The 1st Battalion at Cleveland was withdrawn, expanded, and re-designated as the 278th Armored Infantry Battalion. The 2nd Battalion at Kingsport was withdrawn, converted, and re-designated as the 168th Military Police Battalion. New 1st and 2nd Battalions were constituted in West Tennessee. The 278th Armored Infantry Battalion was federally recognized on 1 September 1947 in eastern Tennessee with headquarters at Cleveland, continuing the lineage of the 117th Infantry Regiment. On 18 March 1947, the 278th Battalion was expanded to become the 278th Regimental Combat Team (RCT) with headquarters in Athens.

====Korean War====
On 1 September 1950, during the Korean War, the 278th RCT was ordered into active federal service at home stations and moved to Fort Devens, Massachusetts. Individual soldiers from the 278th RCT were sent to 8th US Army in Korea as replacements. The 1st Battalion remained in Fort Devens as a training battalion, while the 2nd Battalion was sent to Iceland for garrison duty. The RCT was released from federal service on 8 September 1954 after the end of the war and reverted to state control.

====Reorganization and consolidation====
On 27 October 1954, federal recognition was withdrawn from the 278th Infantry RCT and it was broken up, its units becoming part of the 30th Armored Division. Headquarters and 1st Battalion became the 278th Armored Infantry Battalion at Athens, 2nd Battalion became the 330th Antiaircraft Battalion at Kingsport, and the 3rd Battalion became the 190th Armored Infantry Battalion. The 117th Infantry was also broken up, with headquarters and 1st Battalion becoming the 170th Armored Infantry Battalion at Henderson, the 2nd Battalion becoming the 174th Tank Battalion at Murfreesboro, and the 3rd Battalion becoming the 117th Armored Infantry Battalion at Dyersburg.

On 1 March 1959, the 117th and 170th Armored Infantry Battalions consolidated with the 278th Armored Infantry Battalion, 330th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion and 176th Tank Battalion and were reorganized and redesignated as the 117th Infantry Regiment, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS). The new 117th consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Battalions, all part of the 30th Armored Division. The 117th was reorganized to consist of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Battalions on 1 November 1973, with the 2nd and 3rd Battalions becoming part of the 278th Infantry Brigade and the 4th Battalion joining the 30th Armored Brigade. On the same day, the 278th Infantry Brigade was made a Separate Infantry Brigade, just before the 30th Armored Division was inactivated.

On 29 April 1977, the 278th (Separate) Infantry Brigade was reorganized and re-designated the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment, a separate corps maneuver Unit. Colonel Russell A. Newman was appointed as its first commander. The regimental motto, &quot;I Volunteer Sir&quot;, was inspired by the volunteer units of east Tennessee in the Mexican–American War. The regiment&#x27;s headquarters and headquarters troop (HHT) was redesignated on 1 May from the headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) of the 278th Brigade. The 1st and 2nd Squadrons were redesignated from existing units on the same day. The 2nd Battalion, 117th&#x27;s HHC was redesignated as the HHT of the 278th ACR&#x27;s 1st Squadron at Athens. 1st Squadron was mostly redesignated from the 2nd Battalion. The 1st Squadron&#x27;s Troop A was redesignated from Company B at Cleveland, Troop B from the Support Company at Sweetwater, Detachment 1 of Troop B from Company C at Lenoir City, Troop C from the 376th Signal Company at Newport, Company D from Detachment 1 of the 130th Military Police Company at Oak Ridge, and the Howitzer Battery from Company A at Maryville.

The headquarters and headquarters detachment of the 330th Transportation Battalion at Kingsport was redesignated as the HHT of the 2nd Squadron. Troop E was redesignated from the 1130th Transportation Company at Morristown, Troop F from the 1174th Transportation Company at Bristol, Troop G from Detachment 1 of the 376th Signal Company at Greeneville, Company H from the 130th Military Police Company at Clinton, and the Howitzer Battery from Detachment 1 of the 117th&#x27;s 2nd Battalion at Knoxville. On 30 September 1978, the 777th Maintenance Company (GS), a separate unit stationed in Knoxville at the Knoxville Armory, was reorganized and redesignated as the Air Troop of the 278th. The unit was later relocated to Alcoa. A year later, the 450th Assault Helicopter Company, stationed in Smyrna, was reorganized and redesignated as the Attack Helicopter Troop of the regiment. The headquarters and headquarters detachment of the 130th Aviation Battalion and the 1155th Transportation Company (Aviation Intermediate Maintenance) were attached to the 278th by the State Area Command to serve as command and control for the separate air troop and attack helicopter troop.

On 1 February 1980, the HHC of the 3rd Battalion, 117th at Cookeville was redesignated as the HHT of the 278th ACR&#x27;s 3rd Squadron. 3rd Squadron was mostly redesignated from the 117th&#x27;s 3rd Battalion. Troop I was redesignated from Company A at McMinnville, Detachment 1 of Troop I from Detachment 1 of Company A at Smithville, Troop K from the Support Company at Livingston, Detachment 1 of Troop K from Detachment 1 of Company B at Jamestown, Troop L from Detachment 1 of the Support Company at Crossville, Detachment 1 of Troop L from Detachment 1 of Company C at Harriman, Company M from Company C at Rockwood, and the Howitzer Battery from Company B at Sparta. The 1174th Medium Truck Company (Separate) was reorganized and redesignated as the regiment&#x27;s 190th Engineer Company on 1 October at Pulaski. Detachment 1 was located at Waynesboro. On 17 October 1986, the 278th&#x27;s aviation units were consolidated into a new 4th Squadron, the regiment&#x27;s aviation squadron.

While the 278th Military Intelligence (MI) Company in the ARNG is currently the MI organization for the 278th ACR, that was not always the case. From 1987 until 1997, the 278th&#x27;s MI unit was the 302nd MI Company, U.S. Army Reserve (USAR), stationed in Memphis, TN. The MI organization for the 278th converted from the USAR to the ARNG as part of the realignment of combat, combat service, and combat service support units between the Army&#x27;s two Reserve Components that began in 1995.

The 302d MI Company was organized with a major (MAJ) as the company commander, and was authorized 156 soldiers. In addition to the company headquarters element, the 302nd had a technical control and analysis element (TCAE), two collection and jamming (C&amp;J) platoons, one ground surveillance (radar) (GSR) platoon, one counterintelligence (CI)/human intelligence (HUMINT) platoon, one communications platoon, and support personnel, including food service, motor maintenance, and communications/electronics repair.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom III===
The 278th ACR (278th RCT) deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III (2004–2005) from late November 2004 until November 2005 under the command of COL Dennis Adams. The 278th mobilized out of Camp Shelby, MS beginning in June 2004 with roughly 5800 members. Its major attachments were the 1/128th Infantry (the &quot;Eagle Battalion&quot;), Wisconsin National Guard, and the 386th Engineers from the Texas National Guard.

While conducting mobilization training at Camp Shelby, the three armored cavalry troops of each squadron were equipped with nine M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 13 M3A2 Bradley fighting vehicles, and two 120 mm mortar carriers. The howitzer battery had eight M109A6 howitzers and four Bradleys for the fire support teams while the tank company had 14 more M1A1s. Each armored cavalry squadron also had two additional M1A1s for the squadron commanders and their operations officers (S-3).
The 278th RCT took over from the 30th BCT, North Carolina, commanded by BG Danny Hickman on Christmas Eve 2004 at FOB Caldwell where the regimental headquarters was established. Initially the 278th RCT fell under Task Force Danger and the 1st Infantry Division. In February 2005 the 278th became part of Task Force Liberty commanded by the 42nd Infantry Division. The 1/278th and the 386th Engineer Battalion were located at FOB Caldwell along with the regimental HQ. The regiment operated along the Iranian border in the Diyala Province and in the center of an ethnic triangle formed by Arabs, Kurds and Turkomen in the Salah Ah Din Province. Each squadron was assigned to a FOB (forward operating base) and detachments sent to other locations, with some performing convoy escort missions from Kuwait to Mosul. The 101st Airborne Division (AASLT) replaced the 278th RCT upon the 278th&#x27;s redeployment to the United States.

Other missions included patrolling, providing listening and observation posts (LP/OPs) during elections and for force protection of the International Zone. This unit conducted checkpoints, convoy operations and provided security for the Naval Special Warfare EOD teams as well as Australian bomb squads.

Eight 278th ACR soldiers were killed in action in Iraq in 2005. Two more died of accidents or natural causes.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom 9-11===
The 278th deployed again to Iraq in 2010 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 9-11.

The 278th mobilized out of JFTC Shelby (Camp Shelby) beginning in December 2009 with attachments from Michigan, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and West Virginia National Guard units.

;World War I
* James E. Karnes
::Rank and organization: Sergeant, Company D, 117th Infantry, 30th Division.
::Place and date: Near Estrees, France, 8 October 1918.
::Citation: During an advance, his company was held up by a machinegun, which was enfilading the line. Accompanied by another soldier, he advanced against this position and succeeded in reducing the nest by killing 3 and capturing 7 of the enemy and their guns.
* Edward R. Talley
::Rank and organization: Sergeant, Company L, 117th Infantry, 30th Division.
::Place and date: Near Ponchaux, France, 7 October 1918.
::Citation: Undeterred by seeing several comrades killed in attempting to put a hostile machinegun nest out of action, Sgt. Talley attacked the position single-handed. Armed only with a rifle, he rushed the nest in the face of intense enemy fire, killed or wounded at least 6 of the crew, and silenced the gun. When the enemy attempted to bring forward another gun and ammunition he drove them back by effective fire from his rifle.
* Calvin John Ward
::Rank and organization: Private, Company D, 117th Infantry, 30th Division.
::Place and date: Near Estrees, France, 8 October 1918.
::Citation: During an advance, Pvt. Ward&#x27;s company was held up by a machinegun, which was enfilading the line. Accompanied by a noncommissioned officer, he advanced against this post and succeeded in reducing the nest by killing 3 and capturing 7 of the enemy and their guns.

;World War II
* Harold G. Kiner
::Rank and organization: Private, Company F, 117th Infantry, 30th Infantry Division.
::Place and date: Near Palenberg, Germany, 2 October 1944.
::Citation: With 4 other men, he was leading in a frontal assault 2 October 1944, on a Siegfried Line pillbox near Palenberg, Germany. Machinegun fire from the strongly defended enemy position away pinned down the attackers. The Germans threw hand grenades, one of which dropped between Pvt. Kiner and 2 other men. With no hesitation, Private Kiner hurled himself upon the grenade, smothering the explosion. By his gallant action and voluntary sacrifice of his own life, he saved his 2 comrades from serious injury or death.

<text>The British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, claimed by its publishers to be a work &quot;Comprising an accurate and popular view of the present improved state of human knowledge&quot;, was published at London in 1809 in six octavo volumes and around 150 plates.

The title page credits William Nicholson as the author, and much of the work was overseen by Jeremiah Joyce. Some of the plates were drawn by John Farey Jr., and engraved by Wilson Lowry and Scott.

The work was published by a syndicate of twenty-three booksellers whose names appear on the title page of each volume, headed by the firm of Longman, Hurst, Rees, &amp; Orme. Each purchased shares and in due time received a proportional profit from the eventual sales. This method of publishing was common in the 18th and early 19th century and was known as a conger. It was particularly suited to multi-part works such as encyclopaedias.

The Philadelphia publishing house of Mitchell, Ames, &amp; White published three American editions of &quot;The British Encyclopedia&quot;. The first American edition appeared in 1816-17 but little else is known of this edition. The second American edition appeared in 1818 in twelve volumes, and the third American, also in twelve volumes, closely followed in 1819 and 1821.

In 1998 John Issitt compared the text of &quot;The British Encyclopedia&quot; with the text of Gregory&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot;, which was published in 1806-1807 and also edited by Jeremiah Joyce. Issitt suggests that Joyce developed Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; largely from the text of his prior work on Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;, and he contends, without an empirical showing, that 50% of the text of the two works is identical. If Issitt is correct, given that Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; appeared in two folio volumes and Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; was presented in six octavo volumes, it would seem that Joyce must have copied nearly the whole of Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; into Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;. By observation of a sample of headwords and their articles between &quot;bergamot&quot; and &quot;bignonia&quot;, we find in Gregory 34 heads in 8 columns and in Nicholson 27 heads in 21 columns; of these, 17 articles share some text, and of these, only seven very short articles in Gregory are copied directly and with minimal paraphrasing into Nicholson. This is sufficient to demonstrate that Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; was indeed a useful resource for Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, but within this sample, less than two columns of text in Gregory can be found in Nicholson, and less than three columns of text in Nicholson can be found in Gregory. This sample then suggests that less than 25% of the text of Gregory found its way into Nicholson, and that of Nicholson&#x27;s text, less than 15% can be traced to Gregory.

<text>An armored cavalry regiment (ACR) is a regiment of the United States Army (Active Component, or Reserve Component (Army Reserve or Army National Guard)) organized for the specific purposes of reconnaissance, surveillance, and security. The regiments can be equipped with Cavalry Fighting Vehicles, tanks and helicopters.

The light armored cavalry regiment was developed in the United States Army in the first years of the Cold War to replace the mechanized cavalry groups used during World War II. The new regiments primarily tasked with providing reconnaissance and security capabilities at the corps level, although also able to attack and defend either mounted or dismounted. The structure of each regiment included a headquarters and headquarters company and three reconnaissance battalions, each of which included a headquarters and service company, three reconnaissance companies, and a medium tank company.
