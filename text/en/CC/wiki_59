<text>Gorno-Badakhshan, officially the Badakhshan Mountainous Autonomous Region, is an autonomous region in eastern Tajikistan, in the Pamir Mountains. It makes up nearly forty-five percent of the country&#x27;s land area but only two percent of its population.

== Name ==
The official English name of the autonomous region is the Badakhshan Mountainous Autonomous Region. The name &quot;Badakhshan&quot; (from ; ) is derived from the Sasanian title or . &quot;Gorno-Badakhshan&quot; literally means &quot;mountainous Badakhshan&quot; and is derived from the Russian name of the autonomous region, (literally Gorno-Badakshan autonomous &quot;oblast&quot;). The Russian abbreviation &quot;GBAO&quot; is also commonly used in English-language publications by national and international bodies such as the government of Tajikistan and the United Nations.

== History ==

Borders and political authority in the Western Pamir had always been contested by imperial powers. Between the 17th and 19th century, several semi-self governing statelets, including Darwaz, Shughnun-Rushan and Wakhan, ruled over the territories that are today a part of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region in Tajikistan and Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan. In the late 19th century, the emirates of Kokand and then Bukhara held political authority over the region until the Western Pamir was colonized by Russia, completed in 1896. Although Russia and the British empire in 1896 denominated their shared border through the Pamir, which resulted in the creation of the Wakhan corridor, other regional powers like China and Afghanistan, but also the ruling elites of Badakhshan, Bukhara, Kashgaria and Kashmir equally worked for expending their influence in the Pamir. So, the Sarykol range has been demarked de facto as Eastern border in 1894 between the Qing empire and the Russian empire. This imperial history still has relevance nowadays as it determined contemporary southeastern borders of the present-day autonomous region.

=== Soviet Union ===
The Tajikistani Badakhshan as distinctive polity with its contemporary Western borders and the Russian designation GBAO was created as autonomous republic in 1925. Later in 1929, this was changed to autonomous oblast, of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik SSR). The Soviet Orientalists&#x27; obsession with categorization of peoples led to the fixation of among others the identity category of Pamiris, or &#x27;Mountain Tajiks&#x27; in the Soviet ethnogenesis. During the Soviet Union years, a lot of resources had been allocated to Gorno Badakhshan as borderland of the Soviet Union, for instance through privileged access to higher education and the construction of infrastructure like the Pamir highway in 1935, which is still remembered nowadays as a time of modernity. Therefore, people from the Pamirs used to have facilitated upwards mobility and access to political offices in the Tajik SSR. In scholarly discourse, this is regarded as a measure to safeguard loyalty to state socialism of the subjects at the strategically important Soviet &#x27;frontier&#x27;.

=== Since Independence ===
When the Tajikistani Civil War broke out in 1992, the local government in Gorno-Badakhshan declared independence from Tajikistan. Many politically active Pamiris later joined the democratic political movement La’al-e Badakhshan during the Tajik Civil war, which demanded autonomy and democratic rule for the region. Regionalism was an important structuring factor in the Tajik Civil war, so that the Ismaili identity became a key marker of mobilization. La&#x27;al-e Badakhsan joined the United Tajik Opposition in 1997. Because of that, they were subsequently targeted by the popular front, which constituted the later government and then excluded from the political sphere of independent Tajikistan. The Gorno-Badakhshan government later backed down from its calls for independence.

After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Ismaili development organization AKDN delivered supplies to Gorno-Badakhshan from Kyrgyzstan, which prevented the starvation of the population during the civil war. While the AKDN itself frames this engagement as temporary measure, many of the inhabitants demand a permanent presence of humanitarian aid. Many see it as continuation from the provisioning of goods during the Soviet times. This shared experience of Soviet and Ismaili development aid together with the neglect and crackdown by the Tajik state led to people perceiving themselves as Pamiri rather than Tajik.

In 2011, Tajikistan ratified a 1999 treaty to cede of land in the Pamir Mountains to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), from the Chinese state perspective ending a 130-year-old border dispute and China&#x27;s claims to over of Tajik territory. At other instances Chinese scholars claimed control over the entire Pamir Mountains. However, the government of the Republic of China (ROC) based in Taipei does not recognize this treaty and continues to claim the territory, as reflected in its official maps. Whereas the government of Tajikistan celebrates the ceding of land as diplomatic victory, many Tajikistani scholars, opposition and parts of the population contest the existence of a &#x27;dispute&#x27; altogether, seeing Badakhshan&#x27;s territory in its entirety belonging to Tajikistan. Instead, the ceding of land belonging to Kuhistani Badakhshan in 2011 to China by some, especially in Gorno-Badakhshan was perceived as territorial loss and sparked anxieties about further encroachments of the Chinese state.

=== 21st century civil unrest ===
A number of violent clashes and demonstrations have occurred in the region since the end of the civil war, with major incidences of civil unrest in 2012, 2014, 2018, 2021, and 2022. Clashes erupted on 24 July 2012 between the Tajik military and militants loyal to the former warlord Tolib Ayombekov, after Ayombekov was accused of murdering a Tajik general. On 18 May 2022, around 200 anti-government demonstrators, led by Mamadboqir Mamadboqirov, blocked a road in Rushon which led to the regional capital Khorog. The violent clashes between Tajiikistani military and the GBAO population in 2012, 2014, 2018, 2021 and in 2022 are peaks in the steady militarization of the region. Spectators assess these actions by the government as strategy to gain full political control over the formerly autonomous Gorno-Badakhshan, as well as over the informal opium trade, culminating in the assassination of several influential local leaders. This violates the Tajik peace accord.

In May 2022, Tajik government forces killed 40 civilians protesting against the torture and murdering of the youth representative Gulbiddin Ziyobekov. The Tajik interior ministry stated that the protestors attempted to &quot;destabilise the social and political situation&quot; in the region. Many of the protestors, but also journalists and human rights activists were detained in the subsequent cover-up. Additionally, the government seized properties and kidnapped even oppositional Pamiris abroad. Some human rights activists describe the situation as &#x27;ethnic cleansing&#x27;. Genocide watch is stressing the polarization and the persecution of Pamiris through the government.

== Districts and geography ==

Darvoz District is the western &quot;beak&quot; of the province. West-central Gorno-Badakhshan is mostly a series of east–west mountain ranges separated by valleys of rivers that flow into the Panj. The districts correspond to the river valleys. Murghob District occupies the eastern half of the province and is mostly a desolate plateau with high mountains on the west.

The districts of Gorno-Badakhshan are:
* Darvoz District (westernmost, north)
* Vanj District (west, north)
* Rushon District (west, center)
* Shughnon District (west, center)
* Roshtqal&#x27;a District (west, south)
* Ishkoshim District (west, southernmost)
* Murghob District (eastern two-thirds)

Gorno-Badakhshan covers the entire eastern part of Tajikistan and borders China&#x27;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to the east, Afghanistan&#x27;s Badakhshan Province to the south, and Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s Osh Region to the north. Within Tajikistan, Gorno-Badakhshan&#x27;s western border is with the Districts of Republican Subordination (DRP) and the tip of its southwestern finger (Darvoz District) borders Khatlon Region. The highest elevations in the region are in the Pamir Mountains (notably Mount Imeon), nicknamed &quot;the roof of the world&quot; by locals. Three of the five 7,000 meter summits in Central Asia are located here, including Ismoil Somoni Peak (formerly Communism Peak, and, before that, Stalin Peak; 7,495 m), Ibn Sina Peak (formerly Lenin Peak, and still known by that name on its Kyrgyz flank; 7,134 m), and Peak Ozodi (formerly Korzhenevskoi Peak, 7,105 m).

== Demographics ==
The population living in Gorno-Badakhshan as of 2019 is estimated at 226,900. The largest city in Gorno-Badakhshan is Khorog, with a population of 30,300 (2019 est.); Murghob is the second largest, with about 4,000 residents.

According to the State Statistical Committee of Tajikistan, most inhabitants of Gorno-Badakhshan identify as Pamiris. The remainder of the population perceive themselves as either Kyrgyz or of other nationalities.

=== Languages ===
The de jure official languages of the Badakhshan (Gorno-Badakhshan) Mountainous Autonomous Region are Tajik as the state language and Russian as the interethnic language. Both languages are widely spoken in the region and most residents living in the Pamir are multilingual, as different languages are used in different situations.

Gorno-Badakhshan is home to a number of distinct languages and dialects of the Pamir languages group. The Pamiri language speakers represented in Gorno-Badakshan are speakers of Shughni, Rushani, Wakhi, Ishkashimi, Sarikoli, Bartangi, Khufi, Yazgulyam, and Oroshani. Vanji, formerly spoken in the Vanj River valley, became extinct in the 19th century. There is a sizable population of Kyrgyz speakers in the Murghab district. Many Eastern-Iranian languages spoken in Gorno-Badakhshan are on the endangered list of the UNESCO.

==== Linguistic discrimination ====
The Pamiris are increasingly being marginalized in linguistic and religious terms, as they deviate from the vision for nationhood of the Tajik state. Standard Tajik is used as an instrument of assimilation of smaller linguistic communities.

An inconsistently-enforced and now annulled 2010 law on language required all documents to be made available in Tajik and Russian; the caveat having been to produce such documents originally in Tajik. This created difficulties for the many inhabitants of Gorno Badakhshan who did not speak Tajik to access state services. In this context, Russian is perceived as a more neutral language and secularism can be seen as unequally applied. Facing this marginalization, Pamiris express their distinctive identity against western Tajiks along sectarian lines, even though there is considerable difference in ethnicity, religion and language amongst themselves. 

=== Religions ===
The majority religion in Gorno-Badakhshan is Ismaili Shi&#x27;ite and adherence to the Aga Khan is widespread. Still, there are also Sunnis Muslims in Gorno-Badakhshan. The Tablighi Jama’at, a Sunni missionary movement conducted da&#x27;wa in the 2000s. The government banned and persecuted this movement among others as part of their wider campaign against non-state Islam.

In 2009 the year of I&#x27;mam Hanafi Islam was celebrated, but a majority of Pamiris are followers of Ismaili Shia Islam. Subsequently, religious institutions had to be re-registered, leaving all institutions ousted that did not fit the state&#x27;s religious beliefs.

== Government ==
=== Soviet era ===
The First Secretary of the Gorno–Badakhshan Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan was the highest position in the region during the Soviet era.

== Transport ==

During the 20th century, the Soviet modernity project to establish roads connections in the Pamir led to the communities becoming part of a transit district between Osh, Khorog and Dushanbe. Nowadays, the routes Khorog–Osh and Khorog–Dushanbe are both segments of the Pamir Highway. A third road was constructed through the Kulma Pass in 2004 by China in order to connect Khorog to Tashkurgan. Gorno-Badakhshan is separated from the Pakistani territories of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan by the narrow, but nearly impassable, Wakhan Corridor. Another road leads from Khorog to Wakhan and across the Afghan border.

Even though connectivity is promoted in Gorno-Badakhshan, as the &quot;Golden gate of Tajikistan&quot; local traders largely do not profit from the rise of trade. Instead logistic companies and elites from Dushanbe dominate the long-distance trade, as the Pamiris are increasingly excluded from central posts and have to obtain visas from Dushanbe to travel to China, which is very costly. In June 2022, after local protesters blocking the road were imprisoned, some even killed, a Chinese company started the modernization of a Pamir highway section at the cost of US$200 million.

== Energy ==
In 2019, the European Union and Germany, in coordination with Tajikistan, committed 37 million euros to finance the construction of an 11 MW run-of-the-river hydro power plant along the Shokhdara river. The project is intended to also supply energy to Badakhshan, Afghanistan.

== Sports ==
Khorog is the highest location where bandy has been played.

<text>James Howard McGrath (November 28, 1903September 2, 1966) was an American politician and attorney from Rhode Island. McGrath, a Democrat, served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island before becoming governor, U.S. Solicitor General, U.S. Senator, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Attorney General of the United States.

==Early life==

Born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. McGrath was the son of James J. McGrath and the former Ida E. May. He graduated from the La Salle Academy in 1922, attended Providence College, and went to the Boston University Law School in 1929. McGrath married Estelle A. Cadorette on November 28, 1929; they adopted a son. David.

From 1930 to 1934, he was the city solicitor of Central Falls, Rhode Island. During this time he was also interested in the real estate, insurance, and banking industries. He served as United States Attorney for the District of Rhode Island from 1934 to 1940.

==Governor of Rhode Island==
From 1941 to 1945, McGrath was Governor of Rhode Island, reorganizing the juvenile court system while sponsoring a workers&#x27; compensation fund and a labor relations board, but he resigned in the middle of his third term to accept appointment as Solicitor General of the United States (1945–1946). As governor, McGrath presided over a limited-purpose state constitutional convention in 1944.

... convention convened at the Rhode Island College of Education auditorium in Providence, March 28, 1944 for the purpose of amending the State constitution to eliminate voting registration requirements by members of the armed forces, merchant marines or persons absent from the state performing services connecting with military operations. Delegate continent totaled 200 with Governor J. Howard McGrath serving as president &amp; William A. Needham of Providence as Secretary. Proposal put before the voters at a special election held April 11, 1944. Amendment passed with 7,122 voting for &amp; 119 against.

McGrath was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate from Rhode Island in 1946 to join a Congress (the Eightieth, 1947 to 1949), where the opposition Republican Party had just replaced Democratic majorities in both houses. (See United States elections, 1946.)

He was briefly chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on the District of Columbia for the 81st Congress (to which the 1948 election had returned Democratic majorities). In the Senate, McGrath opposed reducing wartime economic controls and taxes, wishing to spend the latter instead on Social Security, national health insurance, and education.

==Chairman of Democratic National Committee==

He was chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1947 to 1949. In managing President Harry Truman&#x27;s successful 1948 election campaign, McGrath alienated white Southerners but won over crucial black constituencies by integrating the Democratic national headquarters staff.

==Attorney General==
Truman appointed McGrath Attorney General of the United States on August 24, 1949. After McGrath had refused to co-operate in a corruption investigation initiated by his own department, Truman asked for and received McGrath&#x27;s resignation on April 3, 1952.

Alternative accounts have contradictorily suggested that after a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at Truman&#x27;s &quot;Little White House&quot; in Key West, the Secretary of the Navy, along with other members, had threatened to resign if they, too, were forced to comply with Special Assistant Attorney General Newbold Morris&#x27;s request for the personal records of all members who might have received gifts under the scope of the corruption investigation. Under pressure to follow through with the Justice Department corruption investigation, along with the threats of resignation, McGrath agreed that Morris&#x27;s request was asking too much and that the best thing to do was to clean up the department from that point forward and leave the past alone. Truman had been backed into a corner, and the only way out was to ask for McGrath&#x27;s resignation. That account was corroborated by a letter from Truman to McGrath, which hung in the hallway of McGrath&#x27;s summer home in Narragansett, Rhode Island up to the time of his death in 1966.

McGrath entered the private practice of law in Washington, D.C. and Providence. In 1960, he was an unsuccessful candidate to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Theodore Francis Green (Democrat of Rhode Island), losing the Democratic primary (also contested by former governor Dennis J. Roberts) to Claiborne Pell.

McGrath died of a heart attack in Narragansett, Rhode Island on September 2, 1966, at the age of 62. His body was buried at the St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

There is a bust of Senator McGrath outside the House chamber in the Rhode Island State House.

<text>Athletic Club Sparta Praha (), commonly known as Sparta Prague and Sparta Praha, is a professional football club based in Prague.

It is the most successful club in the Czech Republic and one of the most successful in central Europe, winning the central European Cup (also known as the Mitropa Cup) three times as well as having reached the semi-finals of the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) in 1992 and the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1973. Sparta also won the Small Club World Cup, the forerunner to the FIFA Club World Cup in 1969, the only Central European club to do so. 

Sparta have won a record 38 domestic league titles, the Czech Cup (and its predecessor Czechoslovak Cup) 16 times, also a record, and the Czech Supercup twice. Sparta was long the main source for the Czech Republic national football team, however lately this has ceased to be the case, as the best Czech players almost exclusively play in foreign leagues.

Sparta play at Prague&#x27;s Epet Arena, also known as &quot;Letná Stadium&quot;.

==History==
===Early years===
At the close of 1893, a small group of young people based around three brothers – Václav, Bohumil and Rudolf Rudl – had the idea of setting up a sports club. On 16 November, the founders&#x27; meeting approved the club&#x27;s articles of association and one month later, on 17 December, the first annual general meeting took place. Soon after that, the Athletic Club Sparta came up with its tricolour, in which blue symbolises Europe, red and yellow being the symbols of the (then) Royal City of Prague.

At the very beginning of the club&#x27;s football history, the players used to wear black jerseys with a big &quot;S&quot; on the front. They then played for two years in black-and-white striped jerseys, which they returned to, wearing them as a reserve strip, for two years in 1896. In 1906, club president Dr. Petřík was in England where he saw the famous Woolwich Arsenal play with their red jerseys and decided to bring one set to Prague. At that time, he did not realise he was setting up one of the club&#x27;s greatest traditions. Together with the red jerseys, Sparta players wear white shorts and black socks.

Shortly after World War I, a team was put together that triggered off the famous period of the 1920s and &#x27;30s referred to as &quot;Iron Sparta&quot;. A football league in Czechoslovakia was established in the mid-twenties and the club collected title after title. To this day, the fans still recall the names of the players of that period with admiration: Peyer, Hojer, Perner, Káďa, Kolenatý, Červený. A few years later, some no less famous names appeared, such as Hochmann, Burgr, Hajný, Šíma, Silný, Čtyřoký, Košťálek and in particular Oldřich Nejedlý, the top scorer at the 1934 FIFA World Cup. Shortly before this most famous era kicked off, Vlasta Burian, the man who later became the king of Czech comedians, played in goal for the club.

The milestones of the first golden period of the club&#x27;s history are two Central European Cup titles, which in the &#x27;20 and the &#x27;30s enjoyed the same recognition as that of today&#x27;s Champions League. Sparta&#x27;s three titles are important milestones in the cup&#x27;s history. After two triumphs in 1927 and 1935, the third came in 1964, at a time when the cup&#x27;s importance was gradually falling behind that of other European cups.

According to a book about the Massaker von Prerau, the mass murderer Karol Pazúr played for Sparta Prague’s B-team in 1937.

In 1946, AC Sparta toured Great Britain opening with a 2–2 draw against Arsenal on 2 October.

===Golden years===
Golden periods alternated with years when Sparta fans only nostalgically remembered the &quot;good old times&quot;. After substantial changes driven by the socialist regime, bringing frequent changes of the club&#x27;s name rather than achievements to be proud of, the title in 1954 was the last one before a long period of misery. Only the great era of the team around Andrej Kvašňák in the 1960s brought back memories of the club&#x27;s golden years.

There are still many people who recollect the era of Andrej Kvašňák, Jiří Tichý and Václav Mašek. Those were the days when Sparta hosted the biggest number of fans in its history, with the stadium at that time accommodating almost 40,000. All three of the above-mentioned heroes were part of the national team that finished second at the 1962 World Cup in Chile. Other important players in these &quot;golden years&quot; were Josef Vojta, Vladimír Táborský and Ivan Mráz.

===Relegation and comeback===
Up until 1975, Sparta was the only Czech club that had never been relegated to the second division. In this year, however, due to a number of circumstances, the team dropped to division two. The club only spent one year in this division, with the crucial matches for the club&#x27;s comeback to the elite being sold out.

Nevertheless, the club did not win another league title until the early 1980s. Built around Chovanec, Berger, Hašek, Skuhravý and Griga, the team regained its former status and won five league titles in a row between 1986 and 1991. In 1983–84, the team got as far as the UEFA Cup quarter-finals, falling to Hajduk Split. In the early 1990s, this successful era was continued by the next generation of players, such as Siegl, Horňák, Němeček, Frýdek, Němec and Kouba.

===1990s to present===
Sparta has achieved a number of international successes, including two Central European Cup titles in the period of &quot;Iron Sparta&quot;. More recent high points include Sparta&#x27;s performance in the first year of the UEFA Champions League, in 1991–92. Sparta defeated Rangers, then Marseille and reached the semi-final group. Playing Barcelona, Dynamo Kyiv and Benfica, Sparta finished second. Unlike today&#x27;s system, only the group winner reached the final. Being second in the group, Sparta was unofficially Europe&#x27;s third or fourth best team.

Sparta participated in the group stage of Champions League 7 times between 1997 and 2006. The club enjoyed their best Champions League performances in the 1999–2000 and 2001–02 seasons, reaching the now-defunct second group stage on both occasions. In 1999–2000, it won its initial group under the management of Ivan Hašek, and was then third in the quarter-final group. In that group, Sparta came up against a Barcelona squad which went on to reach the semi-finals.

In the 2001–02 season, Sparta was drawn against the eventual winners of both the European competitions during the course of its run. Feyenoord lost twice to Sparta in the champions league group stage and managed to qualify for the UEFA Cup, which it went on to win. Sparta went on to meet Real Madrid in the quarter-final that year. Sparta did not qualify for the group stage in 2002–03, when it was beaten by the Belgian club Genk in the third round of qualifying. 2003–04 saw Sparta take on two Italian giants; initially, the club beat Lazio in the group stage, but after an initial draw Sparta failed to get into the quarter-finals past Milan. The group stage in 2004–05 did not work out at all well for Sparta. After drawing with Manchester United at the sold-out Toyota Arena, the other matches were lost and the club finished last in the group with the club achieving their worst-ever return of just one point from the six matches.

Sparta, usually along with Slavia, has always been a base for the national team; Sparta players contributed to the biggest achievements of the Czechoslovak and Czech national teams. It all started in 1934, when Oldřich Nejedlý was the top scorer at the World Cup in Rome; four years later, seven Sparta players were part of the national team at the World Cup in France. In 1962, Kvašňák and Tichý played for the &quot;silver&quot; team in Chile. In 1990 in Italy, where the national team got as far as the quarterfinal, the team&#x27;s play was mainly created by Chovanec, Bílek, Hašek and other Sparta players, such as Skuhravý, who went on to become a star of the Italian league. Sparta players also contributed to the last big achievement of the already independent Czech Republic team in 1996. Kouba, Frýdek and Horňák returned to Letná from England with silver medals. On top of that, the team was coached by Dušan Uhrin, who had spent his best years at Sparta, and Pavel Novotný came to Sparta two years later. Sparta players also featured in more recent qualification and tournament games of the Czech national team. Miroslav Baranek, Tomáš Votava, Vratislav Lokvenc, Milan Fukal, Martin Hašek, Libor Sionko, Jiří Novotný, Jaromír Blažek and the outstanding talent of Tomáš Rosický helped the team in its UEFA Euro 2000 campaign in Belgium and the Netherlands.

The next era culminating in the bronze medal in the Euro 2004 in Portugal saw Sparta players leaving their unmistakable mark in the national team successes. Zdeněk Grygera, Tomáš Hübschman, Jaromír Blažek, Karel Poborský and academy products Petr Čech and Tomáš Rosický helped Czech football to become recognised as being amongst the elite in Europe and most have played for elite European clubs. Currently, Sparta is one of only two teams in the domestic league which supplies players to the national side. It goes without saying that the club also supplies players to the country&#x27;s various youth teams.

===Brian Priske era===
Following the departure of coach Pavel Vrba, speculation about Sparta Prague&#x27;s next head coach pointed to Adrián Guľa. However, on 31 May 2022, Sparta surprised the public by appointing Danish coach Brian Priske. Under Priske, several key players, including Adam Hložek and Dávid Hancko left the club.

Sparta had its worst start to a season in decades, being eliminated by Viking FK in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Conference League and losing their league opener to Liberec. A series of poor results followed, including five consecutive draws and a heavy 0-4 defeat to Slavia Prague. However, a tactical shift brought immediate results, starting with a 1-0 win over Viktoria Plzeň, Sparta’s first in Plzeň since 2011. This turnaround led to further league victories and progression in the MOL Cup.

By the end of the autumn, Sparta trailed Viktoria Plzeň by seven points. After reinforcing the squad during the winter break, Sparta dominated the spring season, securing first place at the end of the regular season. In the championship group, Sparta overcame Slavia 3-2 in a crucial derby, with Ladislav Krejčí scoring the decisive penalty. A draw against Slovácko secured their 37th league title, the first in nine years.

Sparta&#x27;s good form continued into the 2023/24 season, with strong domestic performances and a brief run in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers, where they were eliminated by FC Copenhagen after a 3-3 aggregate draw. Despite some setbacks in both domestic and European competitions, Sparta finished the year strongly, advancing to the knockout stages of the Europa League and securing key league victories. They were knocked out in the Round of 16 by Liverpool, 11-2 on aggregate.

===End of Priske&#x27;s tenure and leadership changes===
Following the 2023/24 season, Brian Priske left to join Feyenoord and was replaced by Lars Friis. Sparta announced the signing of Kosovo international Ermal Krasniqi, while club captain Ladislav Krejčí departed for Girona. Filip Panák was named the new captain.

Sparta&#x27;s preseason saw wins against AIK Stockholm and Spartak Trnava, but also a heavy defeat to Brøndby. They strengthened their squad further with the additions of Mathias Ross and Imanol García de Albéniz. In the new league season, Sparta won their opener against Pardubice and advanced through the UEFA Champions League qualifiers, defeating Shamrock Rovers before facing FCSB. After a dramatic 3-2 win over FCSB, Sparta twice defeated Malmö FF for a place in the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2004.

==Club symbols==

The name &quot;Sparta&quot; was inspired by the fighting spirit and courage of the people from the ancient city of Sparta. From the very beginning, the colours of Sparta were blue (symbolizing speed, athletics and sport in general), red and yellow (the official colours of Royal City of Prague). In 1906, one of the members of the committee brought (from his trip to England) jerseys of the London club Arsenal. From that time, Sparta has typically played in their red (or, to be more precise, dark red or maroon) colours.

Another symbol of Sparta is the big &quot;S&quot;; thus, Sparta and Slavia Prague are usually collectively called the &quot;Prague &quot;S&quot;&quot; and contest the Prague derby. Sparta Prague has three stars above its crest to signify winning 30–39 national league championships, adding a new star for every ten league titles.

The Czech films &quot;Why?&quot;, &quot;Up and Down&quot; and &quot;Non Plus Ultras&quot; take the culture of Sparta fandom as one of their subjects.

The supporters of Sparta Prague are called &quot;Letenští&quot;, meaning &quot;From Letná&quot;. They sit in the sectors B1-B4, which is behind the goal in the southern stand. The fans have good relations with those of HC Nitra in Slovakia.

==Stadium==

Sparta play their home matches at epet ARENA in the Letná district of Prague. For training Sparta use a football centre at Strahov Stadium (formerly the second largest stadium in the world) whose space was rebuilt to eight football pitches (six fields of standard sizes and two futsal-sized). These are currently used as a training facility by first team, youth academy and reserve squad.

In 1800, Sannikov discovered and charted Stolbovoy Island, and in 1805 Faddeyevsky Island. In 1809–1810, he took part in the expedition led by Matvei Gedenschtrom. In 1810, Sannikov crossed the island of New Siberia and a year later explored Faddeyevsky Island. He also discovered Bunge Land, and suggested that there was a vast land north of the Kotelny Island. This hypothetical island has become known as Sannikov Land.

A strait between Maly Lyakhovsky and the Kotelny islands bears Sannikov&#x27;s name.

<text>Teuthology (from Greek τεῦθος, &quot;cuttlefish, squid&quot;, and -λογία, &quot;-logia&quot;) is the study of cephalopods, which are members of the class Cephalopoda in the phylum Mollusca. Some common examples of cephalopods are octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Teuthology is a large area of study that covers cephalopod life cycles, reproduction, evolution, anatomy, and taxonomy. 

Teuthology is a specific branch of malacology, the study of molluscs. A teuthologist is a scientist who studies teuthology. 

== Research Highlights ==

=== 2023 ===
The publication of the English translation of Albin O Ebersbach&#x27;s thesis on the detailed descriptions of cirrate octopods marks an expansion of access to important taxonomical identifying information in teuthology.

The third paper in the series led by Tristian Joseph Verhoeff revisiting cirrate octopods is published.

=== 2022 ===
Several papers describing new species of cephalopods were published this year. Two of the papers were the beginning of the series led by Tristian Joseph Verhoeff describing new cirrate octopods discovered around Australia and New Zealand. The third paper describes two new &quot;Sepiolina&quot; species also discovered in Australian waters.

== Organizations ==
The Cephalopod International Advisory Council (CIAC) is a group founded by teuthologists to discuss advancements and growth of cephalopod research.

<text>MŠK Žilina () is a Slovak football club based in the town of Žilina, that is playing in the Slovak Superliga. Since the league inception in 1993, the club has won 7 titles and comes second in All-time table that makes them one of the most successful teams in the competition.
The club and their supporters alike are nicknamed &quot;Šošoni&quot; (after the &quot;Shoshone&quot; Native American tribe) and play their home games in the Štadión pod Dubňom. Žilina won their most recent title in 2016-17 season.

==History==

===Early years===
The club was founded towards the end of 1908 under the Hungarian name &quot;Zsolnai Testgyakorlók Köre&quot;, and was officially registered on 20 June 1909. The club won its first Slovak championship (Zväzové majstrovstvá Slovenska) in 1928 followed by another in 1929.

===Czechoslovak League===
In total, Žilina played 30 out of 47 seasons in the Czechoslovak First League spanning from 1945 to 1993 and come 13th in all-time table. Their most successful was 1946–47 season, when they clinched 4th place.

Many consider 1961 a milestone in club&#x27;s history. Firstly, the team reached the final of the National Cup, where they lost to Dukla Prague, the eventual Czechoslovak champion. Despite the defeat, for the first time in its history the club, then known as &quot;Dynamo Žilina&quot;, broke into Europe to contest in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Notable 3–2 and 1–0 victories over Olympiacos moved them in quarter-finals, however the ambitious Slovak team was ultimately knocked out by the previous year&#x27;s winner Fiorentina. Although Žilina grabbed a promising 3–2 victory at home, Fiorentina went through by winning the second leg 2–0.

 Quarter-Finals

====First leg====
====Second leg====

&quot;Fiorentina won 4–3 on aggregate.&quot;

In the late 1960s the club was renamed &quot;TJ ZVL Žilina&quot; and participated in the Intertoto Cup for several years, winning the group in 1969 and coming 2nd a year later. In 1973–74 they reached the final of the Mitropa Cup but they were defeated by Tatabányai Bányász 5–2 on aggregate. Between 1972 and 1974, they finished 5th in the First Division of the Czechoslovak League for three years running, followed by relegation to the Second Division in the 1978–79 season. The club bounced back four years later and finished second in the Mitropa Cup.

===New era – Slovak League===
Following dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, MŠK Žilina has been playing in the Slovak Superliga for the total of 23 seasons with the exception of 1995–96 season after relegation to the Second Division.

In the autumn of 2000, former Czechoslovakian defender Ladislav Jurkemik joined the club as a new manager. After his departure halfway through the 2001–02 season the club appointed Czech coach Leoš Kalvoda. During his short reign at the club he led them to win their first title. In the 2002–03 season, now under the management of Milan Lešický, the club succeeded in retaining the title.

Ladislav Jurkemik was reappointed as a manager during the 2003–04 season. He led the defending champions to 10 priceless consecutive victories to clinch the third successive title though narrowly on a goal difference.
After Slovan Bratislava, MŠK Žilina became only the second club to win three Slovakian titles.
The team&#x27;s performances in next two seasons faded while they lacked the quality they had been famous for during their winning campaigns. In pursuit of silverware numerous players were signed over next two years. In the span of only fourteen months, three managers; the reputable Karol Pecze, his successor Milan Nemec and eventually Marijan Vlak were in charge over the team. Since the results and performances never met the expectations, Vlak ended his reign immediately at the end of 2005–06 season after they failed to reach UEFA Cup spot only to finish fourth.

They played in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, reaching the group stages where they beat Aston Villa 2–1 at Villa Park.

Former Czechoslovakia and later Czech international Pavel Hapal was appointed new manager before 2009–10 campaign. In his first season, he led the team to win a league title, their fifth in nine years. Arguably the greatest success in their history came by making a debut in 2010–11 UEFA Champions League group stage after eliminating Sparta Prague in play-off round. In the following season they completed their first ever double, while the 2012–13 season saw the team finishing 7th – their worst league position since 2000. However, as a defeated finalists of the Slovak Cup the club secured a place to contest in the 1st qualifying round of 2013–14 UEFA Europa League.

<text>The Wicomico River ( ) is a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay on the eastern shore of Maryland. It drains an area of low marshlands and farming country in the middle Delmarva Peninsula.

It rises in northern Wicomico County, close to the Delaware state line, and flows generally southwest, through Salisbury, its head of navigation is Monie Bay on the eastern edge of the Chesapeake Bay between Mt. Vernon and Waterview approximately southwest of Salisbury. The lower of the river form a tidal estuary.

The gentle free-flowing river is a popular destination for recreational canoeing and kayaking, as well as recreational fishing and crabbing. The river has also become a hotspot for water sports such as wakeboarding and water skiing due to its consistently smooth surface. Barge traffic on the river has made Salisbury the primary shipping point for goods on the Delmarva Peninsula over the last several centuries. Two automobile cable ferries cross the river at Whitehaven and Upper Ferry.

A civic group, the Wicomico Creekwatchers, have been testing water quality at 22 different points along the river since 2002. The City of Salisbury partners with Wicomico Creekwatchers, and provides funding. Their 2016 report, released in April 2017, showed that the water quality decreased compared to 2015, with higher levels of phosphorus, nitrogen, and bacteria.

==Etymology==
The name Wicomico derives from the Nanticoke words , meaning &quot;a place where houses are built,&quot; referring to a Native American village on the banks. The river shares the same name with the Wicomico River (a tributary of the Potomac River) in south-central Maryland.

==Tributaries==
There are various tributaries and ponds which contribute to the Wicomico River.
*Beaverdam Creek
*Colbourne Mill Pond
*Johnson Pond
*Parker Pond
*Rockawalkin Creek
*Schumaker Pond
*Shiles Creek
*Tony Tank Pond
*Wicomico Creek

<text>FC Dinamo București, commonly known as Dinamo București () or simply Dinamo, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest that competes in the Liga I.

Founded in 1948 as the team of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, following the merger of Unirea Tricolor and Ciocanul, Dinamo București has spent all but one year of its history in the top tier of the Romanian league system. Domestically, it is one of the two most successful teams in the country, having won 18 Liga I titles, 13 Cupa României, two Supercupa României, and one Cupa Ligii. In the 1983–84 season, Dinamo became the first club in Romania to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, being eliminated by Liverpool 1–3 on aggregate.

Dinamo București&#x27;s traditional home colours are white and red, while the current crest is a modified version of the one adopted in the 1998. Its home venue is the namesake Stadionul Dinamo, although significant matches have also been played at Arena Națională. The team temporarily plays its home fixtures at Stadionul Arcul de Triumf, as its home ground undergoes demolition. 
Its bitter rivals are neighbouring FC Steaua București, with the match being commonly referred to as &quot;the Eternal Derby, while notable rivalries against Rapid București and Universitatea Craiova also exist.

==History==


=== 1948–1955: Foundation and early years ===
On 14 May 1948, &quot;Unirea Tricolor MAI&quot; — newly entered, in January 1948, under the umbrella of the Communist regime&#x27;s Internal Affairs Ministry — merged with &quot;Ciocanul București&quot; and formed &quot;Dinamo București&quot;, the sporting club representing the above-mentioned institution. The people who contributed at the foundation of the club were the Minister of Internal Affairs, Teohari Georgescu and the Jewish brothers Alexandru and Turi Vogl. Until the end of the championship, Dinamo was going to be represented by two teams: &quot;Ciocanul&quot; (&quot;Hammer&quot;), named &quot;Dinamo A&quot; and &quot;Unirea Tricolor MAI&quot;, known as &quot;Dinamo B&quot; (this last one relegating, at the end of the football season, into the Divizia B). Starting with 1950, Dinamo A was separated from Dinamo B, the latter being transferred first to Braşov, then to Cluj-Napoca, and eventually, in 1958, being moved to Bacău, where it became FCM Bacău.

The &quot;Dinamo&quot; name was used for the first time on 1 May 1948. Nevertheless, the real debut of Dinamo was on the 1947–48 Divizia A edition (finishing 8th). Some of the team&#x27;s players were Ambru, Angelo Niculescu, Teodorescu, Șiclovan, Bartha and Sârbu. 

On 11 July 1948, Dinamo played its first international match against SK Židenice from Czechoslovakia, and winning 4–1. 22 August will remain a reference date for Dinamo&#x27;s football, representing the debut of Dinamo Bucharest in the first national Division. The pioneers were, among others, Titus Ozon, Lăzăreanu, Farkaș. The team&#x27;s first coach was Coloman Braun-Bogdan. A year later Nicolae Dumitru and Gheorghe Băcuț join the club. At the end of the 1950 Divizia A edition, Angelo Niculescu retires, dedicating himself to the coaching profession. 

In 1955, Dinamo won their first championship with Angelo Niculescu as head coach, Dinamo impressed mainly in the offensive, with an attack formed by Ene I, Neagu and Suru. The defense, with players like Băcuț I, Băcuț II, Szökő, Călinoiu, was the best in the championship – only 19 goals received.

In the fall of 1956, the team makes its debut in the European Cup (competition created a year before). Dinamo was the first Romanian club to play in the competition. The debut game was played on 26 August 1956, in front of 32,000 spectators. Dinamo defeated Galatasaray with 3–1. In the second leg, Dinamo lost in Istanbul with 1–2, and moved forward.

=== 1950–1981: Domestic success and European competition ===
Dinamo won the second championship in 1962, with players like Datcu, I. Nunweiller, Pârcălab, Frățilă, Popa, Varga (head coaches were Traian Ionescu, Constantin Teașcă and Nicușor Dumitru). In 1963, the club won their third title. Midfielder Vasile Gergely joined the team that season.

In the 1963–64 season, the club won the double with new players such as Octavian Popescu and Emil Petru. In the Romanian Cup final they beat rivals Steaua 5–3. Dinamo played in the 1963–64 European Cup against the famous Real Madrid (1–3 in Bucharest), a team with Di Stefano and Gento. The game played in Bucharest took place at &quot;23 August&quot; Stadium, and established a new record for this arena: 100,000 spectators. 

In the fall of 1964, in the European Cup, Dinamo met Inter Milan with Facchetti, Mazzola, Jair, Corso and Suárez. Dinamo lost both legs, 0–6 and 0–1. 

In 1965, Dinamo won their fourth consecutive title, with players like Mircea Lucescu, Radu Nunweiller and Gheorghe Ene. The following season of the European Cup, Dinamo met again Inter Milan, and managed to win the home game, 2–1. Inter won at San Siro 2–0 and moved forward.

The club won their 6th title in 1971. In the 1971–72 European Cup campaign, Dinamo eliminated Spartak Trnava, the team of Dobias, Kuna and Adamec, and losing in the second round to Ernst Happel&#x27;s Feyenoord 0–3 and 0–2. The 7th title comes two years later, in 1973, when Dinamo won a game against CFR Cluj at the exact margins to pass Universitatea Craiova in the standings. In the 1973–74 European Cup, they surpass Northern Ireland&#x27;s Crusaders Belfast (The 11–0 home game against Northern Ireland&#x27;s team is still the biggest margin of victory in the history of the European Cup), but fail against Atlético Madrid (0–2 and 2–2), the team of Gárate, Irueta, Heredia and Ayala. The next year Dinamo plays in the 1974–75 UEFA Cup and after eliminating Boluspor, they lose to F.C. Koln: 1–1 and 2–3.

&quot;The Red Dogs&quot; won their 8th title in the 1974–75 season, Dudu Georgescu received his first &#x27;Golden Boot&#x27; award after scoring 33 goals that year. The title winning squad included young and experienced players like Sătmăreanu, Moldovan, Vrînceanu, Marin and Deleanu. In the 1976–77 UEFA Cup, Dinamo played against AC Milan with Fabio Capello and Collovatti on its side: 0–0 and 1–2. 

The 1976–77 season brings the 9th title for the club, and the second &#x27;Golden Boot&#x27; for Georgescu (47 goals). In the autumn of 1977 in the European Cup, Dinamo wins a thrilling game against Atlético Madrid 2–1, but loses at Madrid, 2–0.

In the second round of the 1979–80 UEFA Cup (after eliminating Alki Larnaca from Cyprus) Dinamo is eliminated by Eintracht Frankfurt, team of Grabowski and Hölzenbein (2–0 and 0–3 in prolongation). The German side ended up winning the trophy.

=== 1981–1992: Golden team ===
The 1981–82 UEFA Cup season brings some great wins for Dinamo. The red-whites meet Levski Sofia of Bulgaria (3–0 and 1–2). In the second round, a terrifying &quot;double&quot;: Dinamo-Internazionale (with Bergomi, Bagni, Prohaska, Altobelli, Baresi, Oriali, Marini and Beccalossi). At Milan, 1–1 (authors: Pasinato and Custov) and back home in Bucharest, 3–2 for the &quot;dogs&quot;, in the extra time. Dinamo is eliminated by the Swedish team IFK Göteborg, which later ends up winning the trophy.

The 10th national title will be obtained in 1982, when Dinamo also conquers the Cup after a 3–2 victory against Baia Mare. After a 5-year absence, Dinamo reappears in the European Cup, meeting (and eliminating) Vaaleregen Oslo. In the next stage, Dinamo faced the team of Dukla Prague which included players such as Nehoda and Vízek. They win at home, with 2–0, obtaining the qualification at Prague: 1–2. Dinamo is eliminated by Aston Villa, club of Cowans, Withe, Shaw and Morley. In 1983, the club win their 11th title.

The 1983–1984 season began with the retirement of Cornel Dinu, winner of 6 national titles and 6 national cups, with 454 appearances in the first league and 75 in the national team. Still the same year Dinamo wins their 12th title. The autumn of 1983–84 was going to represent a valuable step into the international arena. The European Cup campaign started with the Finnish team, Kuusysi Lahti (1–0 and 3–0). The second round pushes Dinamo against the current champion, Hamburger SV – team of Kaltz and Magath. At Bucharest, Augustin, Mulțescu and Orac score for 3–0. The thrilling second leg finishes 3–2 (goals Țălnar and Mulțescu). In order to accede in the semifinals of the European Cup, Dinamo had to defeat the Soviet side Dinamo Minsk, with Aleinikov, Zygmantovich and Hurynovich. The first leg was 1–1 (Rednic equalizing in the 87th minute), and it was followed by a 1–0 victory at Bucharest (with Augustin scoring). Dinamo was the first Romanian team to reach the European Cup semi-finals, where it met Liverpool. Dinamo lost 1–0 at Anfield in the first leg match where Graeme Souness had punched captain Lica Movila which had set up a tough match back in Romania. In the second-leg Dinamo lost 2–1 to Liverpool who went on to win the competition. In the first round of the next European Cup, in the autumn of 1984, Dinamo meets Omonia Nicosia: 4–1 and 1–2. Next is the match against Girondins Bordeaux (club of Tigana, Giresse, Lacombe and Battiston), Dinamo being eliminated after 0–1 and 1–1. In 1986, Dinamo won the Cup against Steaua (1–0). After an 18-year break, Dinamo played again in the Cup Winners Cup in the autumn of 1986. The 1986–87 season brought the &#x27;Golden Boot&#x27; for Cămătaru (44 goals). The 1988 Romanian cup final was a special one. After Steaua players left the field at the score of 1–1 due to a claim of being robbed by the referee, Dinamo was given the trophy, but later the Romanian F.A. (bowing to pressure from the Communist Party) awarded the match 2–1 to Steaua. After the revolution of December 1989, Steaua propositioned to return the trophy to Dinamo, which refused to take it. In the 1988–89 Cup Winners Cup season, Dinamo again eliminated the Finnish team Lahti, managing to win 3–0. Next is the elimination of Scottish club Dundee United: 1–0 and 1–1 at Bucharest. However, they fail to qualify for the semifinals after losing on away goals, 1–1 and 0–0 against Sampdoria Genova.

The Cup Winners Cup 1989–90 season brings new success. Dinamo meets Albanian team, Dinamo Tirana 0–1 and 2–0. Next is the Greek champion, Panathinaikos 2–0 and 6–1. In the quarter-finals they meet Partizan Belgrade (with Mijatović on the field) eliminating them with 2–1 and 2–0. After six years of break, Dinamo plays a new continental semifinal this time against Anderlecht Bruxelles, losing twice with 1–0. In the summer of 1990, Dinamo – with Mircea Lucescu as coach – conquers a new national title, the 13th. Also the team wins the Cup final, against Steaua: 6–4. The new 1990–91 European Cup season begins with the elimination of Irish club St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic of Dublin (4–0 and 1–1). Dinamo is eliminated in the second round by FC Porto. In the 1991–92 UEFA Cup edition, the club faces Luís Figo&#x27;s Sporting Clube de Portugal, qualifying after a 0–1 loss and a 2–0 victory. The next round Dinamo is eliminated by Italian side Genoa: 1–3 and 2–2. In 1992, the 14th title was added to Dinamo&#x27;s record. It was a triumphal march, with 34 matches and no defeat.

=== 1992–2013: Ups and downs ===
The years to come saw Dinamo in the UEFA Cup. However, without any special results, the team leaves the competition in the first qualification round, in 1993–1994 losing to Cagliari, in 1994–95 losing to Trabzonspor, and in 1996 losing to Levski Sofia.
Among the new players that play for Dinamo are: Catalin Hildan, Florentin Petre, Cosmin Contra. Alongside the goalkeeper Florin Prunea appear Mihalcea and Kiriță. With this new team, in the 1998–1999 season Dinamo plays arguably the best football in Romania, though the team loses the title to Rapid București. Dinamo ended the dark era of the mid-1990s this way once they started to fight for the title this year, only having to wait one more year to win it with no contender. Dinamo played next season in the UEFA Cup beating Benfica 1–0 on Estádio da Luz, then losing a suspected game on Lia Manoliu 2–0. Dinamo won the title in the 1999–2000 with Adrian Mutu playing for them but lost to Polonia Warszawa in the second qualification round of the UEFA Champions League 1999–00 mostly because they sold most of the players in the Summer Mercato. This affected their next season, when they lost the title to Steaua Bucharest. In 2001–02 Dinamo won the title again after a tight championship run. Dinamo managed to win the title in the last game of the season just in front of FC National. In Europe, Dinamo played in the 2001–02 UEFA Cup eliminating Dinamo Tirana in the Qualifying round but lost in the 1st round to Grasshopper Club Zurich. In the 2002–03 season Dinamo was affected again by the players who left the team, with it becoming a tradition for the leaders of the club to sell players after winning a title, losing the games in the UEFA Champions League and having a hard time in Divizia A. Dinamo changed a lot of managers and lost 7 consecutive games. After Ioan Andone came to the team, Dinamo played a spectacular semifinal with Astra Ploiesti. After losing 2–1 in Ploiesti in the middle of the crisis the team beat Astra in Bucharest 3–1 after extra time. They then went on to win the Romanian Cup, after beating FC National in the final 1–0 on a goal scored by Iulian Tames.

After building up a team again in 2003–04, they eliminated Shakhtar Donetsk in the first round of the UEFA Cup 2003–04 season. They went on to lose to Spartak Moscow in the second round. In the Romanian League Dinamo won the title by defeating FCSB in a close battle. They also won the Romanian Cup after a 2–0 win over Oţelul Galaţi at Cotroceni.

 For the 2004–05 season Dinamo played a thrilling game vs. Manchester United in Bucharest, at the National Stadium, in the third qualification round of the UEFA Champions League, but lost 1–2. This game was significant because it showed a lot of progress from the last attempts to qualify for the group phase of the Champions League. The 2nd leg was lost at Old Trafford 3–0.

A highlight in recent times came in the UEFA Cup 2005–06 season when Dinamo thrashed Premier League club Everton 5–1. Dinamo went on to win the tie 5–2. Also, they managed to beat CSKA Moscow (Cup Holders) 1–0 but they missed the European Spring due to a couple of close games lost in the last few seconds. The most controversial was played at Stade Vélodrome, where Dinamo lost 2–1 against Olympique de Marseille although Octavian Chihaia scored the equalizer in the dying seconds, but the referee didn&#x27;t validate the goal because he was turn towards the center of the field, preparing to end the game.

In the 2006–07 season they did qualify for the European Spring where they were eliminated by Benfica after a 0–1 loss at Da Luz and a 1–2 loss at home. Domestically, the team crushed most of its opponents in the first 19 rounds, ending up autumn champions, 13 points ahead of second place and then they secured their 18th title with four rounds to spare. The Romanian champions could have qualified directly to the Champions League group stage for the 2007–08 season, if Manchester United or Chelsea would have won the competition in the 2006–07 season. But AC Milan became champions, and Dinamo had to play a preliminary round before the group phase.

Dinamo failed again to enter the Champions League group phase, being eliminated in the third qualifying round by Lazio Roma. After four manager changes, Dinamo finished the 2007–08 season on the 4th spot in Liga I. In the summer of 2008, Mircea Rednic returned as coach having the mission to win the title and qualify Dinamo to the Champions League, but after the team finished the first part of the season as leader, they failed at the finish line and ended only third.
In the 2009–10 season, Dinamo played in the playoff for Europa League against Czech football club FC Slovan Liberec. In the first leg the supporters invaded the pitch causing the match to be abandoned in the 88th minute when the score was 2–0 for Slovan. The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body awarded a default 0–3 defeat against Dinamo. One week later in Liberec Dinamo managed a memorable comeback and qualified in the Europa League 2009–10 group stage after winning 3–0 in Liberec after 90 and 120 minutes and winning 9–8 at penalties after 10 series. The domestic season was yet another unsuccessful one, finishing 6th in the championships.

Dinamo finished 6th in the 2010–11 season and qualified for the Cup finals against FCSB, but lost due to an own goal. For the 2011–12 season, club started with a new coach, ex-Dinamo player Liviu Ciobotariu.

After a disappointing defeat against Vorskla Poltava in the Europa League Play-Off, Dinamo is leading the Romanian Championship after 10 rounds with the best offense and defense in the championship despite selling Gabriel Torje to the Italian team Udinese with only Dorel Stoica and Srdjan Luchin completing the squad for the new season.

At the end of the autumn season, Dinamo was leading the table by one point ahead of CFR Cluj and started the spring one with a 2–0 win against Gaz Metan Mediaș in the first ever game played by the Red Dogs on the Național Arena in front of a season record of 20,000 spectators that filled the first tier of the brand new stadium. Even in this circumstances, the team had a very disappointing spring run in the league and finished 5th, with 62 points in 34 matches. Still, Dinamo managed to win 2 trophies, the Romanian Cup, in a final against Rapid, qualifying in the process for the Europa League Play-off and the Romanian Super Cup against CFR Cluj.

=== 2013–2017: Changing of ownership and insolvency ===

In March 2013, businessman Ionuț Negoiță bought the club from Nicolae Badea. The 2012–13 season ended with the same team as before the changing of the ownership, but after the season, Negoiță started his moves. He appointed former Dinamo glory Gheorghe Mulțescu as head coach, bought a new president, Constantin Anghelache and a new boss for the youth academy, Gabi Răduță. Things didn&#x27;t work as hoped and in September 2013, Mulțescu was sacked. The decision came because Dinamo won only nine points in the first eight rounds of the Liga I season. Mulțescu&#x27;s replacement was Flavius Stoican who was promoted from the second team. With Stoican at helm, Dinamo started to climb and in March 2014, the team was close to the podium. They finished the season on the fourth spot and reached the semifinals of the Romanian Cup, where they were ousted by FCSB.

In May 2014, Ionuț Negoiță announced that the club began the procedures to enter the insolvency. The Bucharest Court accepted the request in June 2014. Thus, the Licence Committee from the Romanian Federation decided to withdraw Dinamo&#x27;s rights to enter the Europa League. On 24 September 2015, the Bucharest Municipal Court ruled that Dinamo met the criteria to end the insolvency process. But the club wasn&#x27;t able to enter the European competitions, thus, despite ending the season on the 4th position, Dinamo didn&#x27;t participate in the Europa League. In the 2016–17 Liga I season, Dinamo finished third in the play-off and qualified for the Europa League. In the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League season, Dinamo met the Spanish club Athletic Bilbao, in the third qualifying round. The first match, in Bucharest, ended 1-1, with the Brazilian Rivaldinho scoring for Dinamo. But Athletic won the second match 3-0 and Dinamo was eliminated. The following two seasons in Liga I, Dinamo failed to qualify for the play-off and missed the European cups.

=== 2017–present: Troubled times ===

Dinamo failed to reach the play-offs for three consecutive seasons (2018 to 2020) and with each season ended in a lower tier than before. After the ninth place in 2019, Dinamo entered the battle against relegation in the 2019–20 Liga I season. The owner, Ionuț Negoiță, wanted to sell the club, but nobody came with a serious proposal and the fans association bought 20% of the club&#x27;s shares. Adrian Mihalcea was named head-coach in March 2020, but made his debut in June, after the COVID-19 lockdown ended. Mihalcea began his tenure with four losses in the first four games in charge and Dinamo reached bottom in the championship. On 5 July, Dinamo won against Academica Clinceni and hauled themselves off the bottom position but stayed in the relegation zone. The next game ended in a draw, at home, against Politehnica Iași. Thus, Mihalcea was sacked, after only seven games in charge. Gheorghe Mulțescu came back as Dinamo&#x27;s head coach, for the fourth time.

On 6 August, the Liga I season was frozen and Dinamo didn&#x27;t play all its postponed games, finishing the season in 13th place. But the club was spared from relegation after the Romanian Federation decided to increase the number of teams in Liga I from 14 to 16. Thus, only the 14th place played a relegation/promotion play-off against the third place in Liga II.

On 13 August 2020, the club was purchased by Benel International SA, a Spanish company represented by Pablo Cortacero. Dinamo transferred several contract-free players with impressive resumes and big salaries. Cosmin Contra came as head coach and footballers like Borja Valle, Aleix Garcia, and Juan Camara arrived with salaries of up to 33,000 euros per month. But Dinamo had a poor start of the season and the new owner, Pablo Cortacero, did not transfer any money to the players for several months. Almost all the foreign players submitted their memoirs so that they could leave free. Dinamo was left with huge debts, of approximately 7 million euros, and at the beginning of the 2021–22 season, the club went into insolvency again. The 2021–22 season ended with a relegation to Liga II. Dinamo ended 14th the regular season and the play-out, then played the promotion/relegation play-off against Universitatea Cluj, third place in Liga II. U.Cluj won the first match, 2–0 at Cluj Arena. The second leg, at Dinamo stadium, ended 1–1. Thus, Dinamo Bucharest relegated for the first time in its history.

In March 2022, the businessman Dorin Șerdean became the majority shareholder of Dinamo after an agreement to take over the club from Pablo Cortacero. In February 2023, Şerdean accepted the offer received from the Red&amp;White company to sell the club. The owners of Red&amp;White are Andrei Nicolescu, who owns 60% of the company, and Eugen Voicu, who owns 40%. The administrator of Red&amp;White is Eugen Voicu. During the promotion play-off, Dinamo defeated Argeș Pitești with a whopping 6–1, before they lost 4–2 in the second leg, a record breaking play-off with loads of goals, 8–5 in aggregate, which took Dinamo back to the Liga I after just one season of staying in Liga II.

==Crest and colours==

Dinamo&#x27;s colours are red and white. The current crest includes the profile of two red dogs and also a gold star above them, representing the club&#x27;s tenth league title.

==Stadium==

Dinamo plays its home games at Stadionul Dinamo. The current Dinamo Stadium was inaugurated on 14 October 1951. The first match: Dinamo-Locomotiva Timişoara 1–0. The stadium capacity was planned at 16,000, but the installation of seats decreased it to 15,032. The stadium is part of a larger complex which contains a smaller stadium, Stadionul Florea Dumitrache, where the second team, Dinamo II, would play its matches. It is currently used by CS Dinamo București rugby team. There is also a sports hall and a swimming pool.

The stadium is referred to as &quot;Groapa&quot; (The Pit), as it was dug rather than raising stands. The North stand is named Peluza Cătălin Hîldan, in the honor of a former Dinamo player who died in 2000 at the age of 24.

Dinamo plays significant matches, such as against rivals FCSB, at Arena Națională. From 2022 onward, the team plays its home matches at the newly built Stadionul Arcul de Triumf, as its traditional ground does not meet the requirements for first league games.

==Support==

Dinamo has an estimated 13% support in Romania, making them the second most supported Romanian club, after FCSB. The largest concentration of fans is in Bucharest, mainly in the northeast and central areas of the city. The club also has important fan bases on other parts of the country and where significant bases of Romanians are found.
The roots of the Dinamo ultras (fans) movement can be found in 1995 when groups like Dracula and Rams Pantelimon appeared in the North End. In 1996 a group called Nuova Guardia was formed, and became the leading group in the stadium and later on in the entire Romanian ultras movement. Following the death of the former captain, Cătălin Hîldan, in 2000, the fans renamed the North End of Dinamo&#x27;s stadium to Peluza Catalin Hîldan (PCH Stand) in his honor. The majority of supporters are located in the PCH, but several factions have moved to the South End.

===Rivalries &amp; Friendships===
Dinamo&#x27;s significant rivalry is with FCSB, with matches between them dubbed the Eternal derby. Both clubs have had the most popularity in Romania with as strong reactions from its respective fans in clashes in the stadium during games and elsewhere. In 1997, Dinamo&#x27;s fans set a sector of the Stadionul Ghencea on fire. On 16 August 2016, during FCSB&#x27;s UEFA Champions League 0–5 play-off loss against Manchester City, Dinamo fans unveiled a banner that read &quot;Doar Dinamo București&quot; (&quot;Only Dinamo Bucharest&quot;).

The club&#x27;s second most important rivalry is against Rapid București. In the 1990s, there was fierce competition between the two in winning the championship title.

Another rivalry is held against Universitatea Craiova; both finished with the same number of points in the 1972–73 Divizia A, but Dinamo was given the title because of their superior goal difference. A conflict has existed ever since. Other smaller rivalries exist, such as the one against Petrolul Ploiești.

Dinamo&#x27;s fans have a good friendship with Universitatea Cluj&#x27;s fans. The friendship started in the mid-1990s, both ultras groups being linked with &quot;the mentality, fanaticism and nationalist side&quot; and the common hate for FCSB. Dinamo have unofficial friendship with Serbian club Crvena Zvezda. Friendship between this two clubs, are based on Orthodox Christianity same religion.

==Youth program==
Dinamo has an important infrastructure for training professionalism in the sport and developing interest in the youth area. The youth center organises a system based on nine age groups between nine and 18 years. Dinamo has around 180 juniors.

All the groups play in the competitions organised by the Bucharest Football Association and in those created by the Romanian Federation. Youths around 16–18 years old are promoted to the second team, Dinamo II.

The youth center has its base in the Dinamo Sports Center, where they have eight dressing rooms for the players, one for the coaches, one for the referees, a medical center and a store room for the equipment. Also, the center has many training grounds, among them the Piți Varga field.

<doc id="861360" wikidata="Q3411665" url="?curid=861360" title="Institutional pedagogy">
<text>Institutional pedagogy is a practice of education that is centered on two factors: 1. the complexity of the learner, and the &quot;unconscious&quot; that the educator brings to the classroom. This unconscious is another name for the diversity of social, economic, cultural and other unspoken elements that an educator interacts with in an institutional setting; and 2. the role of the institution in the process of intervening in both those psycho-social factors and in what is known by a student.

But even more than this, as conceived by its founder, Fernand Oury, Institutional Pedagogy is a constant calling into question of the institutional context itself. Thus the classroom is never a presupposed and static setting. The movement of Institutional Pedagody is thus in direct opposition to the prevailing trends of education prior to the late 1960s, almost all of which tended to homogenize socio-cultural differences amongst learners, psycho-social factors in learning and most important the presence of the &quot;unconscious&quot; in the classroom itself.

Thus the use of &#x27;institution&#x27; in Institutional Pedagogy is broader than in its more colloquial sense. To Oury the institution could be defined as: &quot;the places, moments, status of each according to his/her level of performance, that is to say according to his/her potentialities, the functions (services, posts, responsibilities), roles (president, secretary), diverse meetings (team captains, different levels of classes, etc.), and the rituals that maintain their efficacy.&quot;

<doc id="861362" wikidata="Q716951" url="?curid=861362" title="Chris Tomlinson">
<text>Christopher George Tomlinson (born 15 September 1981) is a retired English long jumper. He is the former British long jump record holder and competed at the Olympics of 2004, 2008 and 2012.

==Career==
Born in Middlesbrough, Tomlinson began competing for Middlesbrough AC (formerly Mandale Harriers) at the age of 10, mostly over 100m and 200m. He attended Nunthorpe Secondary School, where he still holds many of its year group records for triple and long jump, before attending Prior Pursglove College in Guisborough. In his early teens Chris decided to concentrate on long jump. His major breakthrough came in 2002 when, just three months after breaking both wrists in a freak weight-training accident, he jumped 8.27 m to break the British record that had been held by Lynn Davies for 34 years. On 7 July 2007 he increased his record by a further 2 cm, jumping while competing in Bad Langensalza in Germany.

Tomlinson competed for athletics club Newham and Essex Beagles for some time.

He has won seven national titles in various age groups, including one for the triple jump indoors for under 20s in 2000.

In February 2008 he became the world&#x27;s top long jumper of the year so far with a leap of 8.18m. He won the silver medal at the 2008 World Indoor Championships. He competed at the 2008 Olympic Games without reaching the final. On 20 August 2009, his record was broken by 1 cm by Greg Rutherford in the qualifying for the World Championships long jump final. Both Rutherford and Tomlinson progressed to the final.

Tomlinson regained the British record in July 2011 with a jump of 8.35 m in Paris. Rutherford equalled this distance on 3 May 2012, before surpassing it in 2014.

Tomlinson was conferred with an Honorary doctorate by the University of East London in 2010.

<doc id="861364" wikidata="Q5255587" url="?curid=861364" title="Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee">
<text>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is the Democratic Hill committee for the United States House of Representatives, working to elect Democrats to that body. The DCCC recruits candidates, raises funds and organizes races in districts expected to yield politically notable or close elections. The committee consists of the Chairperson (who according to Democratic Caucus rules is a fellow member of the caucus appointed by the party leader in the House), their staff, and other Democratic members of Congress in various executive roles.

The Chairperson of the DCCC is the sixth-ranking position among House Democrats, after the Speaker, the Majority Leader, the Majority Whip, the House Assistant Democratic Leader, and the Democratic Caucus Chairperson. The current chair is Suzan DelBene of Washington, who assumed the position in 2023.

== History ==

The DCCC was created in 1866 as the Democratic National Congressional Committee. Due to the reform of campaign finance legislation in 2004, the DCCC divides its activities among two organizations prior to Election Day:

# One organization (the &quot;Coordinated&quot; campaign) continues to work on congressional campaigns, offering relevant campaign advice.
# The other organization (the &quot;Independent Expenditure&quot; campaign), makes independent expenditures in congressional districts on behalf of the campaigns but is not allowed to coordinate activities with the campaigns.

In recent elections, the DCCC has played an expansive role in supporting Democratic candidates with independently produced television ads and mail pieces.

Rahm Emanuel assumed the position of DCCC committee chair after the death of the previous chair, Bob Matsui, at the end of the 2004 election cycle. Emanuel led the Democratic Party&#x27;s successful effort to capture the majority in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. After Emanuel&#x27;s election as chair of the Democratic Caucus, Chris Van Hollen became committee chair for the 110th Congress and the 2008 elections. He continued through the 2010 elections. Steve Israel served as chair for the 2012 and 2014 election cycles. For the 2016 election cycle, Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appointed congressman Ben Ray Luján to serve as the committee&#x27;s chair. Luján was selected to serve again for the 2018 election cycle.

For the 2020 and 2022 election cycles, DCCC chairs were elected by the caucus, rather than selected by the party leader. After the 2022 election cycle, the Democratic caucus voted to return to having the position be appointed by the leader. 

In 2022, workers at the DCCC announced they were forming a union affiliated with the Teamsters. Their union was immediately voluntarily recognized.

== Controversy ==

=== Consultant blacklist ===
After Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her upset congressional victory over Joe Crowley in 2018, the DCCC implemented a policy blacklisting consultants who worked for primary opponents of Democratic Party incumbents. Highly unpopular among progressives, the organization rolled back the policy in 2021.

=== Primary preferences ===
In the 2018 election cycle, the DCCC released negative information about candidate Laura Moser, who ran for US Congress in Texas&#x27; 7th congressional district. The move backfired, as Moser gained donations and support en route to making the runoff before falling short against Lizzie Fletcher. A month after the attack on Moser, the DCCC showed preference in another Texas primary, supporting Colin Allred. The decisions were two among many similar choices made by the organization throughout its history. Similar criticism carried into the next election cycle, prompting Progressive Caucus member Ro Khanna to say:

This unprecedented grab of power is a slap in the face of Democratic voters across the nation. It&#x27;s something even Rahm Emanuel would not have done and is totally tone-deaf to the grassroots activists across our nation. Voters are sick of the status quo holding on to power and stifling new voices. They are sick of D.C. politicians who care more about holding on to power than a true competition of ideas.

=== Russian hacking ===
In July 2016, the DCCC said it was hacked. Subsequently, a person described as a hacker and known as &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; (Russian Main Intelligence Directorate persona) reportedly released documents and information that were obtained from the cyberattack on the DCCC.

=== Supporting election denier opponents ===
In the 2022 primary cycle, the DCCC assisted Republican candidates that supported the claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. This assistance took the form of attack ads aired during Republican primaries, the content of which ostensibly decried the further-right candidate&#x27;s election denialism and other views described as &quot;dangerous&quot;, with the aim of making that candidate more appealing to Republican primary voters. It was hoped that those more extreme Republican candidates would be more vulnerable to defeat in the subsequent general election. For instance, in Michigan, they aired ads supposedly against John Gibbs, a far-right challenger to incumbent Peter Meijer, who had voted to impeach Donald Trump in the second impeachment. Gibbs ultimately lost in the general election to Democratic candidate Hillary Scholten.

=== Guilde line of funds to DCCC ===
There are specific rules regarding who can donate to the DCCC. An individual can contribute as much as $41,300 ($82,600 per couple) per calendar year to the DCCC&#x27;s general fund for use at the DCCC&#x27;s sole discretion. Unless informed by the DCCC of a different allocation, the next $123,900 of an individual&#x27;s contribution will be for the DCCC&#x27;s recount fund and all additional amounts, up to the legal limits, will be for the DCCC&#x27;s building fund. For example, in 2023, Srivastava had made several donations totalling almost $290,000 to the DCCC as chairman of Unity Resources Group. It is important to note that certain contributions are prohibited; donations from foreign nationals, federal contractors, national banks, corporations and labor organizations are not permitted.

=== Donations from Gaurav Srivastava ===
In March 2024, the DCCC froze hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Indian businessman Gaurav Srivastava after he was accused of fraudulently pretending to be associated with the Central Intelligence Agency. In 2023, Srivastava had made several donations totaling almost $290,000 to the DCCC as chairman of Unity Resources Group. Campaign officials said the funds were placed in escrow, following concerns about their source and legality.

<text>Omega SA is a Swiss luxury watchmaker based in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland. Founded by Louis Brandt in La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1848, the company formerly operated as &quot;Louis Brandt et Fils&quot; until incorporating the name &quot;Omega&quot; in 1903, becoming &quot;Louis Brandt et Frère-Omega Watch &amp; Co.&quot; In 1984, the company officially changed its name to &quot;Omega SA&quot; and opened its museum in Biel/Bienne to the public. Omega is a subsidiary of The Swatch Group.

Britain&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps used Omega watches in 1917 for its combat units, followed by the U.S. Army in 1918, and NASA in 1969 for Apollo 11. The Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch is marketed as the first watch worn on the Moon, becoming one of the watchmaker&#x27;s most iconic models.

Omega is the current official timekeeper of the Olympics, having first done so in 1932, in addition to being the timekeeper of the America&#x27;s Cup yacht race.

==History==

=== Early history ===

In 1848, Louis Brandt founded the company that would become Omega in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. He assembled key-wound precision pocket watches from parts supplied by local craftsmen. He sold his watches from Italy to Scandinavia by way of England, his chief market. In 1877, his sons Louis-Paul and César joined him, and the company name was changed to Louis Brandt &amp; Fils. In 1894, his two sons Louis-Paul and César developed their own in-house manufacturing and total production control system that allowed component parts to be interchangeable. Watches developed with these techniques were marketed under the Omega brand of Louis Brandt &amp; Frere. By 1903, the success of the Omega brand led Louis Brandt &amp; Frere to rename their company to the Omega Watch Co.

=== Re-organization ===

Louis-Paul and César Brandt both died in 1903, leaving one of Switzerland&#x27;s largest watch companies — with 240,000 watches produced annually and employing 800 people — in the hands of four young people, the oldest of whom, Paul-Emile Brandt, was not yet 24. The economic difficulties brought on by the First World War led Paul-Emile Brandt to work in 1925 towards the union of Omega and Tissot, then to their merger in 1930 into the group SSIH, Geneva.

Under Brandt&#x27;s leadership and Joseph Reiser&#x27;s from 1955, the SSIH Group continued to grow and multiply, absorbing or creating some fifty companies, including Lanco and Lemania, manufacturer of the most famous Omega chronograph movements. By the 1970s, SSIH had become Switzerland&#x27;s top producer of finished watches and third in the world. Up to this time, Omega outsold Rolex, its main Swiss rival in the luxury watch segment, in the race for &quot;King of Swiss Watch brands&quot;, although Rolex sold at a higher price point. Omega tended to be more revolutionary and more professionally focused, while Rolex watches were more ‘evolutionary’ and famous for their mechanical pieces and branding.

While Omega and Rolex had dominated in the pre-quartz era, this changed in the 1970s during the quartz crisis, when Japanese watch manufacturers, such as Seiko and Citizen, rose to dominance due to their use of quartz movements. In response, Rolex continued concentrating on its expensive mechanical chronometers where its expertise lay (though it did have some experimentation in quartz), while Omega tried to compete in the quartz watch market with its own quartz movements.

=== Recent development ===
Weakened by the severe monetary crisis and recession of 1975 to 1980, SSIH was bailed out by banks in 1981. During this period, Seiko expressed interest in acquiring Omega, but nothing came of the talks.

Switzerland&#x27;s other watch making giant Allgemeine Schweizerische Uhrenindustrie AG (ASUAG), supplier of a large range of Swiss movements and watch assemblies, was in economic difficulty. It was the principal manufacturer of &quot;Ébauche&quot; (unfinished movements) and owner, through their sub-holding company General Watch Co (GWC), of various other Swiss watch brands including Longines, Rado, Certina, Hamilton Watch Company and Mido. After drastic financial restructuring, the R&amp;D departments of ASUAG and SSIH merged production operations at the ETA complex in Granges. The two companies completely merged forming ASUAG-SSIH, a holding company, in 1983.

Two years later, the holding company was taken over by a group of private investors led by Nicolas Hayek. Renamed Société de Microélectronique et d&#x27;Horlogerie (SMH), the new group over the next decade proceeded to become one of the top watch producers in the world. In 1998 it became The Swatch Group, which now manufactures Omega and other brands such as Blancpain, Swatch, and Breguet.

Omega experienced a resurgence with advertisements that focused on product placement strategies, such as in the James Bond 007 films; the character had previously worn a Rolex Submariner but switched to the Omega Seamaster Diver 300M with &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995), and later an Omega Planet Ocean and Aqua Terra. Omega adopted many elements of Rolex&#x27;s business model (i.e. premium pricing, tighter controls of dealer pricing, increasing advertising, etc.), which succeeded in increasing Omega&#x27;s market share and name recognition to become a direct competitor to Rolex.

In 2019, Omega licensed its name and branding to Marcolin for a collection of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s optical frames and sunglasses. 

In March 2022, Omega collaborated with sibling company Swatch, both of which are owned by The Swatch Group, to release a budget version of its iconic Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch. The so-called &quot;MoonSwatch&quot;, available in 11 colors, is made of bioceramic (a mixture of ceramic and castor oil) and priced at $260 / £207, well below the $5,250 price (as of March 2022) of the least expensive Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch.

As of 2024, Omega&#x27;s boutique network includes more than 350 stores across the World.

== Watch manufacturing ==

=== Notable inventions and patents ===

* In 1892, Louis Brandt, the founder of Omega, manufactured the world&#x27;s first minute repeating wristwatch in collaboration with Audemars Piguet, which provided the minute-repeating movement. The 18K-gold watch is now kept in the Omega Museum in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland.
* In 1947, Omega created the first tourbillon wristwatch calibre in the world with the 30I. Twelve of these movements were made, intended for inclusion in the observatory trials in Geneva, Neuchâtel and Kew-Teddington, and they were known as the Omega Observatory Tourbillons. Unlike conventional Tourbillion movements whose cages rotate once per minute, the 30I&#x27;s cage rotated one time each seven and a half minutes. In 1949, one of these delivered the best results ever recorded by a wristwatch up to that time. A year later, Omega broke its own record in the Geneva Observatory Trials of 1950.
* In 1999, after the successful development of Calibre 2500, Omega made history by introducing the first mass-produced watch incorporating the coaxial escapement — invented by English watchmaker George Daniels. Considered by many to be one of the more significant horological advances since the invention of the lever escapement, the coaxial escapement functions with virtually no lubrication, thereby eliminating one of the shortcomings of the traditional lever escapement. Through using radial friction instead of sliding friction at the impulse surfaces the coaxial escapement significantly reduces friction, theoretically resulting in longer service intervals and greater accuracy over time.
* On January 24, 2007, Omega unveiled its new Calibres 8500 and 8501, two coaxial (25,200 bph) movements created exclusively from inception by Omega.
* On January 17, 2013, Omega announced the creation of the world&#x27;s first movement that is resistant to magnetic fields greater than 1.5 Tesla (15,000 Gauss), far exceeding the levels of magnetic resistance achieved by any previous movement - a similar movement was used by Daniel Craig as James Bond, though the official collectors watch was labelled as resistant to 15,007 Gauss in honor of the fictional secret agent&#x27;s codename. Most anti-magnetic watches utilize a soft iron - Faraday cage which distributes electromagnetism in such a way that it cancels the effect on the movement contained within. This type of anti-magnetic case required de-magnetizing procedures of the case. Omega has instead built a movement of non-ferrous materials eliminating the need for such a cage and providing a far greater resistance to magnetic fields eliminating necessity of additional maintenance.
*In 2015, they introduced the Master Chronometer Certification, which denotes that along with a COSC (Official Swiss Chronometer Testing Institute) certification, a movement has also passed a series of eight tests set out by METAS (The Federal Institute of Metrology). Master Chronometer watches have a minimum water-resistance rating of (the 2022 Speedmaster &#x27;57 is a Master Chronometer with water-resistance), a minimum power reserve rating of 60 hours, an accuracy rating of 0/+5 seconds per day, and are resistant to magnetic fields of 15,000 gauss. The Master Chronometer Certification debuted on the Globemaster but they now offer it across many more of its watch collections.

===Observatory trials===

Observatory trials focused on the science of Chronometry and the ability to make chronometers measure time precisely. Only Patek Philippe and Omega participated every year in the trials. Omega&#x27;s performances at these competitions garnered the company a reputation of precision and innovation.

For more than a decade (1958–1969), Omega was the largest manufacturer of COSC chronometers. Omega developed the slogan &quot;Omega – Exact time for life&quot; in 1931 based on its historical performance at the Observatory trials. Omega&#x27;s early prowess in designing and regulating timing movements was made possible by the company&#x27;s incorporation of new chronometric innovations.

Notable dates for the Omega precision records:
*1894: Creation of the 19 caliber named Omega. The company is renamed Omega from &quot;Louis Brandt et Frères&quot; in 1903 Omega participates for the first time at observatory trials in Neuenburg, Albert Willemin, Omega&#x27;s first &quot;regleur de précision&quot;, regulated the movement

=== Reference Numbers ===
Before 1962 it was a simple alphanumeric code of two letters followed by four digits. Between 1962 and 2007 Omega used the Mapics system, consisting of two letters followed by either six or seven numbers. The PIC system started in 1988, running concurrently with Mapics, and featured an arrangement of eight numbers in three groups (XXXX.XX.XX).

Finally, today we have the PIC14 structure, with 14 digits in six groups.

==Notable models==

* The Omega wristwatch Ref. H6582/D96043 (1960) once owned by Elvis Presley was sold in auction by Phillips for US$1.812 million in Geneva on May 12, 2018, making it the most expensive Omega timepiece ever sold at auction. The watch was manufactured in 1960 and was sold by Tiffany &amp; Co. in 1961. The watch was presented to Elvis Presley as a gift from RCA Records on February 25, 1961, to commemorate his remarkable achievement of having sold 75 million records. Petros Protopapas, the director of Omega Museum, later confirmed that the museum was the winning bidder.
*The Omega Stainless Steel Tourbillon 301 was sold in auction by Phillips for around US$1.43 million (1,428,500 CHF) in Geneva on November 12, 2017. It was then the most expensive Omega timepiece ever sold at auction.
*In March 1965, the Omega Speedmaster was declared “Flight Qualified for all Manned Spaced Missions.&quot; On July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the Moon wearing his Omega Speedmaster watch. The model of the first watch on the Moon is the Omega Speedmaster 105.012.

==Historic events==
=== Space exploration ===
First worn by Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra in 1962, the &quot;Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronograph&quot; was chosen by NASA to become the only chronograph certified for use on all missions since 1965.

The selection of the &quot;Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronograph&quot; for American astronauts was the subject of a rivalry between Omega and Bulova.

All subsequent crewed NASA missions also used this handwound wristwatch. NASA started selecting the chronograph in the early 1960s. Automatic chronograph wristwatches were not available until 1969. Even so, all the instrument panel clocks and time-keeping mechanisms in the spacecraft on those space missions were Bulova Accutrons with tuning fork movements, because at the time NASA did not know how well a mechanical movement would work in zero gravity.

===First watch on the Moon===
The Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronograph was the first watch on the Moon, worn by Buzz Aldrin. Although Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong was first to set foot on the Moon, he left his 105.012 Speedmaster inside the Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot; as a backup because the LM&#x27;s electronic timer had malfunctioned. Aldrin wore his, making his Speedmaster the first watch worn on the Moon. Armstrong&#x27;s watch is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Aldrin&#x27;s was stolen; he mentions in his 1973 book, &quot;Return to Earth&quot;, that when donating several items to the Smithsonian Institution his Omega was one of the few things stolen from his personal effects.

In 2007, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Omega Speedmaster Professional Chronograph, Omega unveiled the commemorative &quot;Speedmaster Professional Chronograph Moonwatch&quot;. The watch had the distinctive features of the first hand-winding Omega Speedmaster introduced in 1957. It was sold in an edition of 1,957 pieces.

===Deepest normally functioning diving watch===

, the record for the deepest normally functioning experimental diving watch is held by the Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean Ultra Deep Professional after reaching a (revised) depth of ± of seawater during a descent to the bottom of the &quot;Eastern Pool&quot; of the Challenger Deep by the Five Deeps Expedition. Two of these watches were attached to the outside of the Deep-Submergence Vehicle &quot;Limiting Factor&quot;: one on each of the main vessel&#x27;s robotic arms and an additional one on the ultra-deep-sea lander &quot;Skaff&quot;. Due to a technical problem the watch fixed to the ultra-deep-sea lander stayed on the bottom for two days before it and the lander were salvaged from an unrevised depth of . The normal surface air filled watch case is made of (DNV GL certified) forged grade 5 Titanium alloy (same as the hull of the DSV &quot;Limiting Factor&quot;) has a diameter and is almost thick and has been tested and certified for up to 1500 bar/.

==Clientele==
The brand&#x27;s celebrity and politician customers include actor George Clooney, actor Daniel Craig, actor Brendan Fraser, actress Nicole Kidman, actor Cillian Murphy, singer Elvis Presley, actor Ryan Reynolds, Prince William, Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. President Joe Biden and John F. Kennedy.

NCIS

In the US television series &quot;NCIS&quot;, lead actor Mark Harmon wears an Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean with supporting cast member Michael Weatherly wearing a matching version. In both cases, this is the stainless steel model with orange bezel and black dial.

Need for Speed

Omega is the official timekeeper for the video game &quot;Need for Speed II&quot;, released on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in 1997.

Kojak

In the US television series &quot;Kojak&quot;, lead actor Telly Savalas wore a gold-plated Omega Time Computer One, the first mass-produced LED watch.

James Bond
Omega has been associated with James Bond movies since 1995. That year, Pierce Brosnan took over the role of James Bond and began wearing the Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional (model 2541.80.00) in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. In all later films, Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional Chronometer (model 2531.80.00). The producers wanted to update the image of the spy to a more distinctly sophisticated &quot;Euro&quot; look. Omega was eager to participate in the high-profile product placement opportunity to further its brand image and supplied the watches.

For the 40th anniversary of James Bond (2002) a commemorative edition of the watch was made available model 2537.80.00 (10,007 units). The watch is identical to the model 2531.80.00 except the blue watch dial had a 007 logo inscribed across it, machined into the case-back, and inscribed on the clasp.

Daniel Craig, then-current James Bond since &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, also wears an Omega Seamaster: the Seamaster Planet Ocean (model 2900.50.91) in the first part of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, and the Seamaster Professional 300M (model 2220.80.00) in the latter part (from travelling to Montenegro). He mentions Omega by name when questioned by Vesper Lynd (potrayed by Eva Green). With the launch of the film in 2006, Omega released a 007-special of the Professional 300M, (model 2226.80.00) featuring the 007-gun logo on the second hand and the rifle pattern on the watch face, based on the gun barrel sequence of Bond movies.

Omega released a second James Bond limited edition watch in 2006, a Seamaster Planet Ocean model with a limited production of 5007 units. The model is similar to what Craig wears earlier on in the film; however, it has a small orange colored 007 logo on the second hand, an engraved caseback signifying the Bond connection, and an engraved 007 on the clasp.

In the 2008 movie &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, Craig wears the Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean with a black face and steel bracelet (42mm version). Another limited edition was released featuring the checkered &quot;PPK grip&quot; face with the &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; logo. The third limited edition release from Omega came in 2012, based on the Planet Ocean Ref: 232.30.42.21.01.004. It featured a textured dial with the 007 logo at the 7 o&#x27;clock position and a 007 decorated rotor visible through the case-back.

In 2015, two commemorative models were produced for the 24th Bond film, &quot;Spectre&quot;: the Omega Seamaster 300m master co-axial Ref: 233.32.41.21.01.001. 7007 units were produced and came with a NATO strap, as well as the standard bracelet. The watch featured a bi-directional bezel with a world timing scale, rather than the diving scale present on the standard 300m. The second timepiece, the Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra 150m master co-axial Ref: 231.10.42.21.03.004, was decorated with a textured dial based on the Bond family coat of arms and a rotor resembling a bullet and gun barrel with &quot;James Bond&quot; inscribed.

For the Craig’s final film as James Bond, &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021), Omega once again made a special edition of Omega Seamaster for the film, which based from Seamaster 300 that previously used by Brosnan, but with all the case material made from Grade 2 titanium, rather than the usual stainless steel from the basic models, then the color that chose is brown, and also there’s featured the “broad arrow” British military logo on the front and the engraved back of the case.

Sports sponsorship
Omega has frequently been the official timekeeper for the Olympics, beginning with the 1932 Summer Olympics. It was the official timekeeper for the 2006 Winter Olympics, 2008 Summer Olympics, 2010 Winter Olympics, and 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2008, Omega released an Olympic edition watch with the Olympics logo on the second hand. Olympic swimmer and multiple gold medalist Michael Phelps is an Omega Ambassador and wears the Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean. In 2014, Omega became the official timekeeper of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The brand was a Worldwide Olympic Partner at the 2016 Summer Olympics. After the 2020 Summer Olympics were postponed due to COVID-19, the Tokyo Station&#x27;s Olympic countdown clock, made by Omega, which was displaying the number of days until the Games, and a local tourist attraction, was halted and switched to show the current date and time. This partnership will continue at least until 2032.

Omega constructed and maintained a monochrome video scoreboard for Milwaukee&#x27;s County Stadium, the former home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Milwaukee Brewers, which was in use from the board&#x27;s construction in 1980 until the stadium&#x27;s closure in 2000.

Providing support to Emirates Team New Zealand and representing the team&#x27;s official watch, in 2007 Omega introduced the Seamaster NZL-32 chronograph, named after the boat that won America&#x27;s Cup in 1995. The watch was developed in cooperation with Dean Barker, skipper of Team New Zealand and Omega Ambassador.

On July 1, 2011, Omega became the official timekeeper of PGA of America and signed a five-year agreement through 2016. The brand also sponsors the Dubai Desert Classic and the Omega European Masters.
== Controversy ==
In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released a report assigning environmental ratings to 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland, and Omega was given the lowest environmental rating, &quot;Latecomers/Non-transparent&quot;, suggesting the manufacturer has taken few actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change.

Omega faced activist pressure to withdraw from being the official timekeepers of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics after numerous governments enacted diplomatic boycotts over human rights violations (in particular China&#x27;s repression of Uyghurs and other minorities, which some countries have designated as a genocide). Omega defended its continued role as official time keeper of the Olympics by stating its policy to &quot;not to get involved in certain political issues because it would not advance the cause of sport in which our commitment lies.&quot;

<text>Berner Sport Club Young Boys (YB by short abbreviation, ) is a Swiss professional sports club based in Bern, Switzerland. Its first team has won 17 Swiss league championships and eight Swiss Cups. YB is one of the most successful Swiss football clubs internationally, reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup in the 1958–59 season. The club&#x27;s colours are yellow of a golden shade and black.

== History ==
=== 1902–1925: The early years ===
The club was founded in 1898. Its name was intended to mimic that of the Basel-based club Old Boys.

YB began to be successful very early on. Against Lausanne they celebrated a surprising 2–2 draw and on 26 October 1902 a 7–0 victory over Fortuna Basel. In these years YB also came out from the shadow of FC Bern. YB beat their city rivals away 3–1 and on 8 March 1903 5–0 at home. YB won the championship of the Central League and were invited to play in the finals of the Swiss championship. On 22 March was the first final against FC Zürich. YB played, among others, the two Schwab brothers, and they beat Zurich 3–1. On 29 March YB faced the West champion FC Neuchâtel. The guests from Neuchâtel were the clear favorites, because the Bern club had lost to them one month before 1–4. This caused Neuchâtel to make the error of underestimating the Young Boys. The Neuchâtel defense completely broke apart when the YB striker Walter Frey found the net shortly after halftime to post a 1–0 lead. The game ended with a one-sided 5–0 result, and YB after only five years of existence had won their first Swiss football championship.

After having trained for the early years on the Schwellenmätteli, below the Kirchenfeld bridge, YB played from the year 1904 at Spitalacker-Platz. In subsequent seasons the Young Boys did not win the championship but were always in the top three in the regional group. It took six years for YB to achieve further successes. In 1909, the Bernese defeated FC Winterthur in Basel in the finals 1–0. The next year, the Young Boys won the championship finals against FC Aarau 3–1 and against Servette Geneva 2–1. Again in 1911, Servette Geneva and FC Zürich could not prevent YB&#x27;s fourth championship overall and third in a row. It was the first title hat trick in the history of the Swiss Football Association. YB was also in 1910 and the two following years the champion of the &quot;Anglo-cup&quot;, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Swiss Cup.

At the time, the fans spoke of a time all opponents dreaded, the &quot;YB Quarter Hour&quot; 15 minutes before the end of the game. The players sustained their efforts throughout the 90 minutes so effectively that the opponents began to run down after about 75 minutes. An example is the 1910 finals between the YB and Aarau, where until the 80th minute the score stood at 1–1. Similarly, in the game against Servette in the final round in 1911, up through the 72nd minute the game was a 1–1 draw, but three goals in the last 18 minutes turned the result decisively for YB to clinch the title hat trick.

In 1913, the English football instructor Reynold Williams became the first coach of the club. Shortly thereafter, World War I erupted, and Spitalacker-Platz was converted to a potato field. YB arranged to rent facilities at Kirchfeld for 1,400 francs per year. The military also made space available at the barracks for the team&#x27;s use. Despite these hardships, the club won Swiss league championship again in 1920.

After the war, the team again played on the Spitalacker-Platz. However, the ground no longer suited the requirements of the Young Boys, so they searched for alternatives. They found space at the northeastern border of the city at the Wankdorffeld, and construction was initiated.

=== 1925–1951: New name and new stadium ===
In 1925, the association&#x27;s name was changed from FC Young Boys to Berner Sport Club Young Boys. This year was also the last game on the old Spitalacker-platz. In October, the new Wankdorf Stadium by the architects Scherler &amp; Berger was opened with a tournament. It was attended by the Old Boys from Basel, Servette Geneva, and the Young Boys. The new sports complex included a main grandstand with 1,200 covered seats, a restaurant, changing rooms, a training hall and a training ground. In total, the new stadium held 22,000 spectators, including covered standing room for 5,000. YB now had a large and modern stadium, which intensified the rivalry with FC Bern, because the older association continued to play at the small and outdated Neufeldplatz. The two clubs went so far as to negotiate a contract, facilitated by Central President Schlegel, to prevent discord.

In 1929, YB once again progressed to the final round of the Swiss championship. The first game, on a Sunday, pitted Urania Geneva Sport against YB, the second a week later Grasshoppers against Urania GC, and on the third Sunday in the final YB–GC. The first game in Geneva ended with a 0–0 draw, which satisfied the Bernese. When the Grasshoppers beat Geneva in Zurich 3–0, the chances for YB to win the title decreased tremendously. In the third game, the guests from Zürich needed only a draw to win the championship for the third time in a row. For this final on 30 June, Young Boys deployed replacement goalkeeper Erich Jung in the offensive midfield position due to player shortages. Striker Johan Baumgartner also scored a goal and YB prevented the championship hat trick with a 2–0 win.

On 10 February 1930, the club purchased an additional strip of land from the community, having noted that the stadium was too small, increasing the entire area of the Wankdorf stadium ground to 35,585 square metres. The 1930 Young Boys became the first to celebrate a Swiss Cup championship. The Swiss Cup had been initiated only five years earlier following the discontinuation of the Anglo Cup at the First World War. With 30,000 spectators crowding Wankdorf YB beat FC Aarau 1–0. In the following 15 years, YB won neither a league title nor a cup championship.

During this time, Wankdorf continued to expand. The capacity of the stadium increased by building an extension to 42,000 spectators, costing the association an additional 300,000 francs. Furthermore, another training field was added.

Towards the end of the 1930s, the world economic crisis started and Swiss football felt the effects. The attendance figures fell steadily, and the Sportplatz Spitalacker could no longer meet its financial obligations. After the outbreak of World War II, the club considered selling the stadium. However, through a debt-reduction and the help of the city of Bern in 1943, the finances of the club were rehabilitated. At that point, the stadium group changed its name to &quot;Verein Fussball-Stadion Wankdorf&quot;.

During World War II, the Bernese succeeded but could not claim a title. Only in 1945, at the end of the war, came the next success: YB won the second Cup against FC St. Gallen with a 2–0 victory at Espenmoos. Two seasons later, the Bernese were relegated to the National League B. It would be three seasons until they returned to the highest league where they would then remain for over 50 years.

=== 1951–1964: The golden years under Coach Albert Sing ===
In 1951, Norbert Eric Jones was replaced after only one year as the manager by the previously unknown Albert Sing. At that time, no one anticipated the successful years YB would experience under the German coach. Sing acted initially as a player-coach before he decided to become a trainer only. During his tenure YB experienced its most successful period. The team was reinforced by high-level transfers such as Eugene &quot;Geni&quot; Meier. Considerable success during this period was also attributed to the goalkeeper Walter Eich, who was one of the best in the history of the Young Boys. Later, the team consisted of top players like Heinz Schneite and Ernst Wechselberger.

For the 1954 FIFA World Cup, the capacity of the Wankdorf stadium was increased from around 30,000 to more than 60,000 seats.

In the spring of 1953, Young Boys again advanced to the Cup. YB met Grasshoppers Zürich in the final pairing, and the clubs drew 1–1. Five weeks later, the teams met in a replay, which went to the Bernese 3–1. In the summer of that year, YB was invited to tour North America. The team played there against some American teams, Liverpool (1–1), and the Republic of Ireland national team (a 4–1 win for YB). YB produced impressive results overseas for Swiss football and was enthusiastically received by thousands upon its return to Bern. From 1957 and 1960, YB were Swiss champions four times in a row. During this time, YB became one of the more successful teams in European football and was superior to all Swiss opponents. 1958 brought yet another Cup when YB defeated Grasshoppers in a final replay, 4–1.

Young Boys also achieved success in European competition. At its first appearance in the European Cup, it were politically disadvantaged, however: the Bernese drew the Vasas Budapest, the Hungarian club of the Interior Ministry. Some Swiss politicians demanded that no Swiss sports club should have contacts with the Hungarian football club, especially in Bern, the capital. Servette FC made its Charmilles Stadium available for one game, and 20,000 spectators supported YB in Geneva during a 1–1 draw against the Hungarians. In the return match, however, Young Boys fell 1–2. The following year, Young Boys&#x27; opponents in the European Cup were once again from Hungary, this time MTK Budapest. YB won the leg in the Nep Stadium 2–1. 26 November 1958 saw the European premiere in Wankdorf; 28,000 spectators celebrated the Young Boys&#x27; 4–1 victory.

In the second round, YB met the East German champions SC Wismut Chemnitz and the Wankdorf was filled with 32,000 spectators. The teams drew 2–2 after a 2–0 lead for the Young Boys. A week later, the teams met in the GDR. The game ended 0–0, which at that time required a deciding game. This took place on 1 April 1959 in the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium before 35,000 spectators, and YB won 2–1. Thus, Young Boys qualified for the European Cup semi-finals. Their opponents in the semi-finals were Stade de Reims.

The game of games in the history of the yellow-and-black took place on 15 April 1959, a rainy Wednesday. Sixty-thousand spectators packed into Wankdorf, but the crowd may have exceeded the official count. After an impressive performance, YB won 1–0 on a Geni Meier goal in the 13th minute. The game was a legend in Bern. Stade de Reims received the Bernese in the return match at the Parc des Princes, Paris, where the Frenchmen won 3–0 to reach the final. No other Swiss team besides FC Zürich has since found as much success in an international competition as Young Boys did in this season.

In 1960, YB played internationally once again, meeting Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round, where Frankfurt won 4–1 before 36,000 spectators. In the return match at Frankfurt&#x27;s Waldstadion, YB managed a 1–1 draw. In 1961, the team first travelled to Ireland to meet Limerick, where YB won with an impressive 5–0 showing, then again 4–2 in front of 22,000 spectators at Wankdorf in the return leg. In the second round, YB met Hamburger SV (and its star striker Uwe Seeler) in what was the first European Cup game in that team&#x27;s history. Forty-five thousand spectators were at the game in the Wankdorf, where Hamburg stunned YB with a 5–0 victory. In Hamburg, the Bernese improved upon their previous performance, earning a 3–3 draw before 40,000 spectators in the Volksparkstadion. It would be the last appearance in Europe for YB for a long time.

After four league titles, a European Cup run and many successes, Young Boys traveled 31 days through the Far East, in five weeks having visited ten countries and played several friendly matches against Asian teams.

Albert Sing left BSC Young Boys in 1964 and is still the most successful coach in the history of the club.

=== 1964–1984: Averageness ===
The successor to Albert Sing had large shoes to fill; average performance was no longer acceptable to the discriminating Bernese supporters. Heinz Bigler and Hans Grütter took over the training until Hans Merkle ultimately succeeded Sing. Merkle had the misfortune to be measured against the championships of his predecessor. Although Geni Meier, Ernst Wechselberger and other players from the championship years continued to play, it mattered little. Merkle was a demanding coach of the German school, however, and was able to keep YB in the top half of the table, with finishes of second, fifth, and seventh. The mixture of old and young players did not provide the results the Bernese sought, however.

Otto Messerli, then a junior in the first team squad who in later years would be captain of the Young Boys, described the situation: &quot;There were many good ideas, but FC Basel and FC Zürich remained unattainable for us.&quot; This was also no different for the Merkle successors Skiba, Schneiter und Eich, Brülls, Peters and Linder: The Young Boys reached big games on occasion (such as the Cup final against Basel that brought 52,000 spectators to the Wankdorf), but over the long term their performance was unspectacular. Still, some YB players rose to national recognition. The Dutchman Bert Theunissen replaced Meier and Wechselberger in 1964 as &quot;gunner&quot; and he became Swiss scoring champion before he left YB. A good replacement for him was found, however: the Bernese bought Dieter Brenninger from Bayern Munich. Another new transfer, Walter &quot;Wale&quot; Mueller, played between 1967 and 1972 for YB, and was a dreaded striker for opposing defenders.

In the late 1960s and &#x27;70s, the Bernese met with little success. As YB were runners-up in the 1974–75 season, they finally returned to European competition. In the first round of the UEFA Cup, the club faced Hamburger SV once again. In the first leg before 17,000 spectators in the Wankdorf, the two teams played to a 0–0 draw. HSV won at home in its Volksparkstadion (4–2), and Young Boys were bounced from the competition early. The Young Boys&#x27; side for these games included Jakob Brechbühl and Karl Odermatt among others.

It took until 1977 before YB would again win a title. Under coach Kurt Linder, the Cup was brought to Bern for the fifth time. Thanks to this title, YB qualified for the preliminary round of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The Bernese faced a daunting challenge in the form of the Rangers of Glasgow. At Ibrox Park, YB played strongly, only losing 0–1. The return game in front of 17,000 spectators at Wankdorf ended 2–2, and Rangers advanced. The Young Boys again underwent a change of coaches when René Hüssy replaced Linder. 1979 again saw YB (as losing cup finalists) in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. On 19 September 1979, only 6,700 spectators came to Wankdorf to see the game against Steaua București, which ended 2–2. Before this game, YB had lost three consecutive championship games, which may have contributed to the lack of fans. The goals were scored by Stoica, Zwygart, Iordănescu and Schönenberger. Two weeks later, Young Boys lost in Bucharest, 0–6.

=== 1984–1991: Mandziara era ===
Turbulent times continued in the Wankdorf. After many coaching changes, in 1984 Alexander Mandziara was hired as manager. The quiet Pole with a German passport played offensive football and was known for hard training sessions. In his first years, Young Boys reached only ninth place. In the next season, 1985–86, not all went for YB but the team still managed to finish the preliminary round in fifth. During the winter break, the Swede Robert Prytz joined the YB midfield as a playmaker alongside Georges Bregy, and YB achieved an incomparable return round. The point advantage of the leaders Neuchâtel Xamax slowly melted round by round. On 24 May 1986, the showdown came in Neuchâtel Maladière before a crowd of 21,500 including visiting YB spectators. Young Boys came away with a 4–1 result. Lars Lunde, Danish scoring champion, and Dario Zuffi each connected twice and YB after 26 years finished in championship position.

In the first round of the European championship, the Bernese drew Real Madrid, whose ranks included top stars Hugo Sánchez and Emilio Butragueño. Thirty-two thousand spectators descended on Wankdorf, despite torrential rain, for the match on 17 September 1986. Urs Bamert headed in a goal to provide the 1–0 margin of victory against the guests from Spain. For the return leg, 75,000 spectators occupied the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. Until the 75th minute, the advantage stood at only 1–0 for the home side. But the 2–0 by Jorge Valdano broke the defense of the Young Boys, and Real Madrid went on to win 5–0.

In 1987, YB won the Cup for the sixth time. In the finals, it defeated Servette FC 4–2 in a replay. In the first round of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Young Boys traveled to Dunajská Streda, Czechoslovakia, where the Slovak team won 2–1. Before 8,100 spectators, YB prevailed in Bern 3–1 and qualified for the second round. In the round of 16, the Bernese visited FC Den Haag, where it lost 1–2. In the return match in Bern, only 6,400 spectators braved the icy chill of the Wankdorf. A 1–0 YB victory was enough to progress into the quarter-finals. The next opponent was again from the Netherlands, this time Ajax of Amsterdam. Temperatures of −6 on 9 March 1988 caused Wankdorf to be rather sparsely occupied with only 7,686 spectators. Ajax won the game 1–0. The return leg in Amsterdam before 30,000 spectators saw the Bernese lose again 1–0 to fall out of the competition.

=== 1991–2001: Down and up ===
A highlight of the 1990s was the Cup finale against FC Sion in 1991. The Wankdorf was packed with 50,000 spectators, with both teams contributing to the atmosphere. At halftime, the Bernese led 2–0, but Sion shot back in the second half with three goals to win the Cup. In 1993, YB qualified for the UEFA Cup and met Celtic in the first round. Only 7,300 spectators came to the stadium for the home leg, and the game ended 0–0. Young Boys fell in Celtic Park in Glasgow before 21,500 spectators in extra time, 1–0, with André Baumann netting an own goal in the 105th minute.

In the mid-1990s, the former football powerhouse increasingly experienced problems. Young Boys developed financial difficulties and in 1997 – for the first time since the 1946–47 season – YB was relegated to the National League B (today&#x27;s Challenge League). New Swedish coaches Roland Andersson and Thomas Sjöberg helped the club recover, placing first and earning promotion again, with Robert Schober and Admir Smajic taking over on the bench. The following NLA season began with a surprise victory over the reigning champion Grasshoppers. Many defeats, however, forced the Young Boys back into the relegation play-offs. The economic and sporting emergency ended in the dismissal of coach Claude Ryf. The BSC Young Boys organization stood very close to bankruptcy and few thought it still possible to salvage YB. A Lucerne investment company saved the club from ruin, although by 1999 the debt was over 1.7 million Swiss francs (~€1.08 million).

Almost the entire squad left the capital and YB competed with the shell of a team the next season. The result was disastrous: third-last place after the 1999 qualification/descent round. The possibility of further relegation to the 1st League (third tier) threatened. Marco Schällibaum took over as manager and brought in reinforcements, which had a positive impact and enabled the club to stay up. On 17 December 1999, the BSC Young Boys AG was established with capital of CHF 500,000 (~€320,000). The AG took over the operations of the first time and increased the share capital. The remaining operation remains under the previous organization.

The next championship was contested with a more powerful team with new players such as Harutyun Vardanyan and Gürkan Sermeter. YB won victory after victory in the autumn and inspired the loyal fans with attractive offensive football. The team earned the top place in the table and participation in the promotion playoffs, ultimately returning to the top division.

New enthusiasm developed in Bern, and the attendance figures rose significantly. The first game of the 2001–02 season was the final game in old Wankdorf stadium. YB drew FC Lugano 1–1 before 22,200 spectators, and the last goal for the Bernese in the old Wankdorf was tallied by Reto Burri.

=== 2001–2005: In the Neufeldstadion ===
Young Boys played at the Neufeldstadion at the north end of town until the new, multi-functional Stade de Suisse Wankdorf Bern was opened in 2005.

In the autumn of 2001, with a 1–3 home defeat against Grasshoppers, a series of 25 home games without defeat came to an end. However, with a 1–0 victory in the last game against FC St. Gallen on 9 December 2001, Young Boys qualified for the final round for the first time in seven years. The start of the final round was very promising. YB played exciting football and contended for a place in an international competition but ultimately finished in seventh position. The team also reached the semi-finals of the Swiss Cup before falling in a penalty shootout to FC Basel.

In 2002, YB finished the qualifying round in seventh and the final round in fourth place, earning the Young Boys an entry in an international competition (the UEFA Cup) for the first time in ten years. This season also saw Stéphane Chapuisat move to the club. Chapuisat is considered one of the best strikers in Swiss history.

In 2003, the league was completely reformed, including the names and sizes of the two highest leagues. For the 2003–04 season, Hans-Peter Zaugg was named as the new head coach. The played in the first &quot;Super League&quot;, taking second place. As a result, the team entered the second qualifying round of the 2004–05 Champions League, where they fell to Red Star Belgrade 5–2 on aggregate. The domestic season 2004–05 found them finishing in fourth place.

=== 2005–2018: In the new Wankdorf Stadium ===
In the summer of 2005, Young Boys began using the newly built Wankdorfstadion, the Stade de Suisse, after several years of construction.

Only a few months later Gernot Rohr signed as a coach. Although team maintained a defensive football strategy, the club succeeded with him at its head, advancing to the Cup final, but losing on a penalty shoot-out to Sion. The first season at the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf, YB finished in third place, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. The Bernese defeated Mika of Armenia 4–1 on aggregate in the first qualifying round to set up a very attractive matchup with French giants Marseille, but narrowly lost the tie on away goals with draws 3–3 at home and 0–0 away.

Coach Gernot Rohr was succeeded by Martin Andermatt. The debut of Andermatt was promising, as YB defeated their canton rivals Thun 5–1 to open 2006–07 league play. The team finished the season in fourth place, once again returning to the UEFA Cup. On 14 April 2007, the club president Peter Mast announced that he would resign his position at the end of the season, although he immediately joined the board of directors. His post as president was assumed by Thomas Grimm on 17 April 2007. Incidentally, in this season, with an average of 15,517 spectators in the championship, the club celebrated its highest attendance average in club history.

Young Boys finished runners-up in the 2009–10 season, finishing three points behind champions Basel despite losing only one match at home all season. It entered Champions League qualification and defeated Fenerbahçe to set up a meeting with Tottenham Hotspur in the play-off round. YB went out to a 3–0 lead in the opening leg at Stade de Suisse on Tuesday 17 August, but had to hold on for a 3–2 win, then, fell 4–0 at White Hart Lane eight nights later and went out of the competition. Following its defeat, Young Boys was dropped to the Europa League group stage. The Bernese club qualified for the knockout stage of the tournament as runners-up of its group, behind group leaders VfB Stuttgart and at the expense of Getafe and Odense. In the Round of 32, the club faced Zenit Saint Petersburg, defeating its Russian opponents at home in the first leg (2–1), but suffering elimination after the second leg, losing 3–1 in their visit at Saint Petersburg.

In the 2010–11 season, the club finished third in the league, which qualified YB to the UEFA Europa League for the next season. The following season was similar for the Yellow-Blacks, finishing third once again in the league. In the same season, YB failed to reach the Europa League group stage after being eliminated by Braga 2–2 on aggregate on the away goals rule (0–0 in Braga; 2–2 in Bern).

===2018–present: Return to Dominance===

On 28 April 2018, following a 2–1 home win over Luzern, Young Boys were confirmed as 2017–18 Swiss Super League champions, their first league title in 32 years.

On 28 August 2018, Young Boys qualified to UEFA Champions League Group stage for the first time in their history, after defeating Dinamo Zagreb with a 3–2 aggregate score in play-off round.

In April 2019, Young Boys secured their 13th title in club history. In the next season, manager Gerardo Seoane led the club to a domestic double, delivering their 14th league title (their third in a row) and seventh cup title and first in over 30 years. The club would go on win the league title again in the 2020–21 season. Seoane left to join Bundesliga club Bayer 04 Leverkusen following the 2021 title success and was replaced by former Huddersfield Town and Schalke 04 manager David Wagner on 10 June 2021.

Under Wagner, Young Boys were able to qualify for the Champions League group stage, beating Slovan Bratislava, Cluj, and Ferencváros in the qualifier. They were seeded into Group F with Atalanta, Villarreal, and English giants Manchester United. In their first game in the Champions League, YB shocked Manchester United, beating them 2–1 thanks to a goal by Jordan Pefok in the 95th minute. The team was unable to continue their good performance and exited the tournament in last place of their group.

The harsh schedule in the first half of the season took its toll on the team and by the winter break, they saw themselves only in third place in the Super League, eleven points behind leader FC Zürich. Despite gaining 15 points in seven games after the break and overtaking FC Basel in second place, their deficit to the leader expanded to 15 points. In particular, a last minute equalizer by Grasshopper and giving away a 3–0 lead to FC St. Gallen worried club management. David Wagner was released by mutual agreement on 7 March 2022. In the interim, assistant coach Matteo Vanetta took over coaching duties until the end of the season.

On 2 June 2022, Raphaël Wicky was announced as the new head coach for the upcoming season. In his first season, he achieved the domestic double, winning the clubs eight cup and 16th Swiss championship. On 4 March 2024, he was dismissed as head coach due to stagnating results, with U21 coach Joël Magnin taking over on an interim basis.

On 14 May 2024, Patrick Rahmen was announced as the coach for the upcoming 2024–25 season. He signs a two-year contract with Young Boys. He was dismissed after just 99 days on 8 October 2024, following the worst league start in the 21st century, with just six points in nine games. Joël Magnin will once again step into the caretaker role until a permanent replacement is found.

== Stadium ==

Since 2005 Young Boys has played its home matches at Stadion Wankdorf. The stadium seats 31,120 spectators and is the second largest football stadium in Switzerland, after St. Jakob-Park. Between 2005 and 2020 the stadium was named Stade de Suisse Wankdorf, the name arising from the fact that the Wankdorf ought to act as a National Stadium. As one of the few stadiums with artificial turf, however, national team matches are rarely held there. The artificial pitch allows Young Boys to hold daily training sessions at the stadium as Young Boys doesn&#x27;t have a training center. For UEFA Euro 2008, a natural grass field was laid to allow three group stage matches to take place. The stadium is also the largest stadium-integrated solar power plant in the world. On the roof of the Stade de Suisse are enough solar cells to generate 700,000 kWh. This requires approximately 300,000 square meters of panels i.e. 30 hectares. The electricity powers the stadium and some houses around the Wankdorf area. 

The total construction cost of the project was 350 million francs which was at the time more than any other building in Switzerland. The building (and the club) are both owned by businessman Hans-Ueli Rihs who together with his late brother Andy has financed Young Boys since taking ownership at the beginning of the millennium. Andy died on April 18, 2018, just 10 days before YB won the championship.

Between 1925 and 2001 Young Boys had played in the historic Wankdorf Stadium located on the same spot as the new stadium. While the new stadium was being constructed, Young Boys played its home games at Stadion Neufeld.

<text>The Rotten Calder is a river to the east of East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, Scotland and along with the Rotten Burn it forms the southern and western boundaries of Blantyre.
It begins as the Calder Water at its source at Ardochrig, and is joined by the Cleughearn, Lea and Drumloch Burns around Langlands Moss which drain from the Eldrig Hills. This river has also been titled the &#x27;West&#x27; or &#x27;South Calder Water&#x27;, although the latter title is shared by another river in Motherwell. Upon being joined by the Rotten Burn to the south-east of East Kilbride, the river becomes the Rotten Calder Water. &#x27;Water&#x27; is a term used in Scotland to denote a small river.
The Rotten Calder runs through a gorge titled Calderglen, where it flows through East Kilbride Parish. This area of the gorge is under the jurisdiction of Calderglen Country Park, run by South Lanarkshire Council. Over 160 nature trails border the river on both banks, in addition to the forest which occupies the slopes, and ferns, mosses and liverworts on the rocky precipices. European otter, roe deer and European green woodpecker can be seen in the southern reaches of the park. Common buzzards can be seen hunting over open areas by the river and the grey heron, grey wagtail and white-throated dipper are common sights too. The river flows by the site of the former Calderwood Castle (demolished 1947–1951).
The gorge of the Rotten Calder Water was celebrated in books and poems for its grandeur and lush ivy-tied crags. Many traces of 18th- and 19th-century landscape additions can be traced in the park, as well as old mines, quarries, and religious sites. After passing under the General&#x27;s Bridge at Stoneymeadow, the Water flows by Crossbasket Castle (House) in an easterly direction, and on through the former estates of Greenhall and Milheugh where the valley is seen to give way to wide flood plains.
After Milheugh the river again regains its steep gorge and flows through scenery before flowing into the River Clyde near Daldowie. There are many waterfalls on the river, these are Millwell Linn, Flatt Linn (Crutherland Linn), Torrance Linn (Fairy Linn or Walk Fort Linn), Black Linn, Trough Linn, Calderwood Linn (Castle Falls), Crossbasket Linn, Horseshoe Falls, Old Horseshoe Linn, Small Falls, and Milheugh Falls.

East Kilbride Angling Club have the fishing rights and stock the river with brown trout occasionally but not every year. Permits are available from calderglen visitor centre and the post office at the town centre
The river flows via the north side of Blantyre and forms the eastern boundary of the Newton district of Cambuslang before joining the River Clyde opposite Daldowie.

The valley of the Rotten Calder includes hermitages, islets, caves, crannies, ancient markings, fountains, fairy wells, numerous waterfalls, over 200 nature trails, summerhouses, ruined castles, and steep cliffs.

In addition to Calderglen Park and Calderwood House, the river is referenced in other man-made features near its course, including the Calderwood residential area of East Kilbride, Calderglen High School in the same town, Calderglen House and the former Caldervale village near Blantyre, and Calderside Academy in the same town.

<doc id="861370" wikidata="Q7748761" url="?curid=861370" title="The Lost Treasures of Infocom">
<text>The Lost Treasures of Infocom is a 1991 compilation of 20 previously-released interactive fiction games developed by Infocom. It was published by Activision for MS-DOS, Macintosh, Amiga, and Apple II versions. It was later re-released on CD-ROM, and in 2012 on iOS.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot; compiles 20 interactive fiction titles, with which the player interacts via text parser.

The compilation includes &quot;Zork I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, along with the &quot;Zork&quot;-connected games &quot;Beyond Zork&quot;, &quot;Zork Zero&quot;, &quot;Enchanter&quot;, &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Spellbreaker&quot;. The other titles included are &quot;Deadline&quot;, &quot;The Witness&quot;, &quot;Suspect&quot;, &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot;, &quot;Ballyhoo&quot;, &quot;Infidel&quot;, &quot;Moonmist&quot;, &quot;Starcross&quot;, &quot;Suspended&quot;, &quot;Planetfall&quot;, &quot;Stationfall&quot; and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

The package contains all the instructions (bound in one volume) and maps for each game as well as all the InvisiClues, printed normally instead of using &quot;invisible&quot; ink. The package also features a launch menu which lets the user select which one of the 20 games they wish to play.

Some significant omissions from the package were the &quot;feelies&quot; for which Infocom had become known. The package merely contained photocopies or pictures of these items, such as the sunglasses from &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; and the Stellar Patrol ID card from &quot;Planetfall&quot;.

==Development==
Discussing the announcement of &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot;, Scorpia of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; noted that Activision was &quot;rising like a phoenix ... from the bankrupt ashes of Mediagenic&quot; with the release. After the company&#x27;s restructuring during bankruptcy, it began to lean on its back catalog of licenses, including &quot;Zork&quot;. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick later said that &quot;&quot;Zork&quot; on a brick would sell 100,000 copies&quot;. Infocom had been closed by Activision in 1989; the publisher held the copyright to nearly all the past Infocom titles.

An additional bonus was the updated version of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;. The game was repackaged using a later version of the Z-machine than the original, and now featured a built-in hint system.

==Reception==
&quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot; was a commercial hit. Peter Doctorow of Activision reported in 1992 that &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot; was &quot;selling extremely well&quot;. Jeremy Reimer of &quot;Ars Technica&quot; wrote, &quot;Retailing for $99, it sold over 100,000 copies and was almost pure profit. The ashes of Infocom saved Activision from bankruptcy.&quot;

Brian Walker of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; declared &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot; Activision&#x27;s best game of 1992. Reviewing the iOS version of the game in 2017, &quot;TouchArcade&quot; gave it a strongly positive review.

==Sequel==

The success of the original &quot;Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot; prompted a follow-up collection published in 1992 titled &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom II&quot;. This package contained 11 more classic Infocom titles. The games included in &quot;Lost Treasures II&quot; were:

&quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; was not included, but could be ordered for $9.95 via an enclosed coupon.

The games&#x27; InvisiClues were not included as before; instead, a card advertising a pay-per-minute hint line was included in the package.

In addition to being dual-format (MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh), the CD-ROM version included three extra games:
* &quot;James Clavell&#x27;s Shōgun&quot;
* &quot;Journey&quot;

The &quot;Soul of the Samurai&quot; and Known World maps from Shogun and the map from Journey were included separately; an added instruction manual included the &quot;Book of Hours&quot; from Arthur as well as instructions for all three added games.

<text>Trabzonspor Kulübü is a Turkish professional sports club located in the city of Trabzon, located in northeastern Turkey. Established in 1967 through the merger of several local clubs, Trabzonspor is one of the most prominent football clubs in Turkish history. The men’s football team has won seven Süper Lig championships, making Trabzonspor the first non-Istanbul-based club to achieve this feat in the Turkish league system. In addition to their football achievements, Trabzonspor also operates a women’s football team, a men’s basketball team, and several other sports branches, reinforcing its status as a multi-sport club.

Trabzonspor rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, dominating Turkish football with six league titles between the 1975–76 and 1983–84 seasons. This golden era marked the club as a powerhouse, with Trabzonspor becoming a symbol of regional pride and the only club to challenge the dominance of Istanbul-based teams, such as Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray, and Beşiktaş. During this period, they also won nine Turkish Cups, including a streak of three consecutive league titles in 1978–79, 1979–80, and 1980–81.

After their sixth league title in 1983–84, Trabzonspor endured a 38-year championship drought, marked by near-misses and structural rebuilding. This drought ended triumphantly in the 2021–22 season, as Trabzonspor clinched their seventh league title, led by a strong squad and under the management of Abdullah Avcı. The victory sparked massive celebrations across the city and reaffirmed the club’s status as one of Turkey’s most decorated and respected teams.

The club’s colors are claret and sky blue, reflected in their iconic striped shirts, symbolizing the identity and culture of the Trabzon region. Trabzonspor has played its home matches at the Şenol Güneş Sports Complex since the 2016–17 season, a state-of-the-art stadium that replaced the historic Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadium.

Trabzonspor’s influence extends beyond football, with the club recognized for its passionate fan base and significant contributions to Turkish football and sports. Its matches often symbolize the cultural identity of the Black Sea region, making it more than just a football club—a cultural icon.

==History==
=== Early Years and Local Rivalries (1923–1962) ===
There were four clubs in Trabzon in Early years : İdmanocağı (1921), İdmangücü (1913), Necmiati (1923) and Trabzon Lisesi. All four clubs competed against each other in the Trabzon Amateur Regional League. in 1923, two of the clubs, İdmanocağı and İdmangücü, held a fierce rivalry that was equal to the Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray rivalry.

The rivalry reached its peak from 1930 on. İdmanocağı won five titles in a row from 1929 to 1933, with İdmangücü besting the record with seven titles in a row from 1934 to 1940. The league was dominated by Lise for six years, before İdmangücü took back the title in 1947–48. More clubs were being founded in Trabzon at the time, including Doğan Gençlik, Akçaabat Sebatspor, Sürmene Gençlik, Zafer Gençlik, Yolspor, and Yalıspor.

The rivalry between Trabzon İdmanocağı and İdmangücü split Trabzon into two, with one side taking the red and yellows (İdmanocağı), and the other taking the green and whites (İdmangücü). The split frustrated the fans as well as the players, which led to some of Trabzon&#x27;s biggest talents moving to Ankara and Istanbul to play football. These included Hasan Polat and Ali Polat (Gençlerbirliği), Selim Satıroğlu and Ahmet Karlıklı (Galatasaray), Zekeriya Bali (Fenerbahçe), and Nazmi Bilge (Beşiktaş).

===The Merger and the Birth of Trabzonspor (1962–1973)===
At the start of the 1962–63 season, then president of the Turkish Football Federation, Orhan Şeref Apak, asked cities to combine their football clubs into one representative team, and have them compete in the Milli Lig (Süper Lig). However, due to the rivalry between İdmanocağı and İdmangücü, the city of Trabzon weren&#x27;t able to merge. City and club officials would meet every morning and night to iron out an agreement, but it never materialized.

Instead, only İdmanocağı, Martıspor, and Yıldızspor merged on 21 June 1966. They began wearing yellow and red kits and competed in the 1.Lig (Second Division). They finished eighth place in their first season, as well as runners-up for the Başbakanlık Kupası. A month later, İdmangücü, Karadenizgücü, Martıspor, and Yolspor merged to form Trabzonspor. Their club colours were red and white.

İdmanocağı opposed the merger and took up a lawsuit against the newly founded Trabzonspor. Ulvi Yenal, head of Physical Education, decided to step in and announce that neither İdmanocağı nor İdmangücü would be accepted into the 1.Lig. This sent a shockwave thru both clubs. Until these two clubs decided to unify into one club, the city of Trabzon would not have a professional representative. In the end, İdmanocağı and İdmangücü decided to merge, along with Karadenizgücü and Martıspor, to become Trabzonspor on 2 August 1967.

Everything was set up, but the club still ran into another roadblock: club colours. The club came to the decision after five meetings with fans and club officials. At first, it was suggested the club should wear the predecessor colours together (yellow-red and green-white), but it was deemed not suitable. It was then suggested that a poll be held, but that was also quickly cast aside. The fans and club officials began to lose patience until Turkish Football Federation General Manager Ulvi Yenal came up with a compromise. He suggested that both clubs, İdmanocağı and İdmangücü, should choose a colour opposite of their own club colours. It was then both clubs came up with maroon and blue.

=== Founding Years and the Journey to the Top (1967–1973) ===

This period is remembered as the years Trabzonspor played in the Turkish Second Football League. In 1967, the Trabzonspor was established under the roof of Trabzonspor and started competing in the Second League White Group during the 1967-68 football season. Trabzonspor completed its first year in professional leagues in 6th place among 20 teams in this league, following Boluspor.
In the following two years, Trabzonspor finished 4th in the league. In the 1970–71 season, Trabzonspor finished 8th.
During the 1971–72 football season, Trabzonspor competed in the Red Group but missed promotion to the Turkish First Football League (currently called the Süper Lig) by two points.

A year later, Trabzonspor experienced the same fate; despite having the same points as the leader (Kayserispor), it finished second due to goal difference and failed to achieve promotion to the Turkish First Football League.

In the 1973–74 season, Trabzonspor won the Red Group by finishing six points ahead of its closest rival, Sakaryaspor. Although Trabzonspor lost the championship match against the winner of the other group (Zonguldakspor) in a penalty shootout, it finally earned promotion to the Turkish First Football League.

During these years, players like Necmi Perekli, Şenol Güneş, and Cemil Usta, who would later become part of the championship-winning team, started to feature in the squad.

Perekli became the league’s top scorer twice while playing for Trabzonspor.
=== 1973–1984: The Golden Era of Championships ===

Ahmet Suat Özyazıcı took over as manager in 1973. Özyazıcı played for İdmanocağı, the precursor club to Trabzonspor. This period covers Trabzonspor’s phase after being promoted to the Turkish First Football League. Trabzonspor was promoted to the Turkish First Football League in 1974. Its first season in this league was the 1974–75 season, during which Trabzonspor finished 9th with 30 points. In addition, during the same year, Trabzonspor reached the final of the Turkish Cup but failed to win the trophy after defeating Beşiktaş 1–0 at home and losing 2–0 in Istanbul.

The 1975–76 football season was the first time Trabzonspor won the Turkish First Football League championship. During this season, Trabzonspor climbed to the top of the league after defeating Fenerbahçe 1–0 in Trabzon and maintained its lead until the end of the season. Under the leadership of Ahmet Suat Özyazıcı, the team secured the championship with 43 points, three points ahead of Fenerbahçe.

From its first championship in the 1975–76 season until the 1983–84 season, Trabzonspor won six league titles. In this period, Trabzonspor missed out on the championship in the 1977–78 and 1981–82 seasons by one point and the 1982–83 season by two points. Trabzonspor secured its sixth league title in the 1983–84 season, finishing five points ahead of Fenerbahçe.

During the 1976–77 season, Necmi Perekli became the first player from Trabzonspor to become the league’s top scorer, scoring 18 goals. During this era, Trabzonspor’s goalkeeper Şenol Güneş achieved an extraordinary feat by not conceding a goal for 1,110 minutes between 17 September 1978 and 18 February 1979. This record made him the longest unbeaten goalkeeper in Turkey’s leagues and the 15th longest in world football history.

During this period, Trabzonspor also made their mark in European football. The club famously defeated the then-English champions Liverpool 1–0 in the first leg of their second-round match-up in the 1976–77 European Cup, although they were eliminated after losing the second leg 3–0.

Additionally, during this period, Trabzonspor won 3 Turkish Cups, 6 Presidential Cups, 3 Prime Minister&#x27;s Cups, and the Cyprus Peace Cup. Two of these championships came under the management of Özkan Sümer, while the other four were achieved under Ahmet Suat Özyazıcı. Özyazıcı currently serves as Trabzonspor’s Football Advisor, while Sümer served as Trabzonspor’s president for a time but resigned in protest after an incident in a match against Fenerbahçe.

=== 1984–1995: Transition and Renewed Ambitions ===

From 1984 to the 1994–95 season, Trabzonspor finished seasons in rankings ranging from third to seventh place. Undergoing a new squad restructuring, Trabzonspor, during the tenure of head coach Georges Leekens in the 1992–93 season, fell 10 points behind the leader in the first ten weeks of the season. The team went six weeks without a win, experiencing one of the worst periods in its history.

However, players like Ünal Karaman (who later became captain of the national team) and Tolunay Kafkas were brought into the squad during this time. They became key players in Trabzonspor’s starting lineup as the team finished second in the league during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and re-entered the championship race. During this period, Trabzonspor’s most notable achievements were the Turkish Cup titles won in 1992 and 1995, the Presidential Cup in 1995, and the Prime Minister’s Cup victories in 1985 and 1994.

=== 1995–96 Season: Triumphs, Tragedies, and Missed Glory ===

With the end of the 1993–94 season, Trabzonspor appointed its former captain Şenol Güneş, who had been managing İstanbulspor, as the head coach. Alongside Hami Mandıralı, who is Trabzonspor’s all-time top scorer with 218 goals, and Ogün Temizkanoğlu, players like Shota Arveladze and Archil Arveladze were added to the squad. Shota made a significant impact by scoring numerous goals in his first year.

Trabzonspor lost the championship to Beşiktaş in the 1994–95 season but managed to win both the Turkish Cup and the Presidential Cup. In the 1995–96 season, where Shota became the league’s top scorer, Trabzonspor missed the championship once again. On 5 May 1996, in a match held at Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadium, Trabzonspor took a 1–0 lead but lost 2-1 to Fenerbahçe after goals from Oğuz Çetin in the 55th minute and Aykut Kocaman in the 82nd minute. This loss is considered a significant trauma in Trabzonspor’s history. Following the match, a fan in Görele, Giresun, deeply saddened by the loss, committed suicide, leaving a note that read: “Wrap me in a Trabzonspor flag when I am buried. No one is responsible for my death. If I were to be reborn, I would want to be born as a Trabzonspor fan again.

Despite failing to win the championship, Trabzonspor managed to secure the Prime Minister&#x27;s Cup at the end of the season. However, the effects of the missed championship lingered into the next season. After an away match against Kocaelispor, fans were involved in a fatal car accident on their way back. At the funeral of the victims, players faced significant backlash, and captain Ogün Temizkanoğlu was attacked by fans.

By the early 2000s, the team underwent significant changes. Players like Abdullah Ercan, Ogün Temizkanoğlu, and Tolunay Kafkas were let go, and expensive signings like Rune Lange were made. However, players such as Rune Lange, Kevin David Campbell, and Jean-Jacques Missé-Missé failed to deliver successful performances for Trabzonspor. In some cases, such as with Rune Lange, disputes arose, leading to cases being taken to FIFA.

=== 2000s: Struggles, Restructuring, and Revival ===

The early 2000s were one of the most unsuccessful periods in Trabzonspor’s history. In the 2001–02 season, the team finished 14th in the league, marking the worst season in its history. Additionally, this season went down in history as the one where Trabzonspor conceded the most goals and suffered the most defeats.

Following this season, the then-president Özkan Sümer decided to restructure the team by appointing Samet Aybaba as the head coach. This restructuring included bringing in foreign players such as Ibrahim Yattara, who became the club’s top assist provider and the foreign player with the longest tenure, and Michael Petković, as well as homegrown talents like Gökdeniz Karadeniz and Fatih Tekke. This foundation led Trabzonspor to win the Turkish Cup in the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons and contend for the championship in the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons, finishing second behind Fenerbahçe in both seasons.

After Trabzonspor lost a match to Fenerbahçe in Istanbul in 2004, Trabzonspor fans accused referee Cem Papila of making incorrect decisions that cost the team the championship. Fans organized a protest in Trabzon attended by 40,000 people, calling for the resignation of the Federation and the Central Referee Board. Following the backlash, Cem Papila announced his retirement from refereeing.

Under the presidency of Nuri Albayrak, Trabzonspor sought success by signing high-profile foreign players like Marcelinho and Kiki Musampa. However, these players struggled to adapt to the team.

In 2008, Sadri Şener was elected as president. Following this, a large part of the squad was replaced, with Ersun Yanal being appointed as head coach and 25 new players being transferred. With these transfers, Trabzonspor competed for the championship until the final weeks of the 2008–09 season, ultimately finishing third.

=== 2010s: Challenges, Rebuilding, and Financial Restructuring ===

The Trabzonspor management appointed Hugo Broos as head coach for the following season, but his contract was terminated after poor results. Şenol Güneş was then hired as his replacement. With Güneş at the helm, the team achieved positive results. In the 2009–10 season, Trabzonspor won both the Turkish Super Cup and the Turkish Cup. Trabzonspor finished the first half of the 2010–11 season as league leaders. However, despite finishing the season with 82 points, Trabzonspor lost the title to Fenerbahçe on goal difference. That season, following the match-fixing case involving Fenerbahçe on 3 July 2011, Trabzonspor requested that the championship trophy be awarded to them. During the same period, UEFA banned Fenerbahçe from European competitions for two years. Trabzonspor decided to take the matter to CAS and FIFA. While this process was ongoing, Trabzonspor lost several key players and entered the 2011–12 season with a significantly different squad, finishing in third place.

In the 2012–13 season, Sadri Şener was succeeded by İbrahim Hacıosmanoğlu as club president. After losing 3–1 to Elazığspor in the 19th week of the season, Şenol Güneş, who had been managing the team since 2009, resigned, and Tolunay Kafkas was appointed as interim head coach until the end of the season. The team performed poorly compared to the previous season, finishing ninth in the league, but qualified for the UEFA Europa League by reaching the Turkish Cup final, where they lost 1–0 to Fenerbahçe.

In the 2013–14 season, Trabzonspor signed players such as Florent Malouda and José Bosingwa and appointed Mustafa Reşit Akçay as head coach. Despite struggling in the league, Trabzonspor successfully qualified for the UEFA Europa League group stage by defeating Derry City, Dinamo Minsk, and Kukesi in the qualifying rounds. In the group stage, they were drawn with Lazio, Apollon Limassol, and Legia Warsaw, finishing as undefeated group leaders with 14 points. However, they were eliminated in the Round of 32 by Juventus, losing both legs 2–0. After Akçay resigned in the 20th week of the league, Hami Mandıralı was appointed as head coach. Trabzonspor finished fourth, qualifying for the Europa League once again.

Before the 2014–15 season, Vahid Halilhodžić was appointed as head coach, and the squad underwent significant changes, with nearly 20 new signings, including Óscar Cardozo, Mehmet Ekici, Kévin Constant, Waris, and Yatabare. However, poor results led to Halilhodžić’s dismissal after the 10th week, and Ersun Yanal returned for a second stint. Under Yanal’s management, Trabzonspor performed better, advancing to the Europa League Round of 32 by finishing second in a group that included Metalist Kharkiv, Lokeren, and Legia Warsaw. They were eliminated by Napoli, losing 4–0 at home and 1–0 in the return leg. Trabzonspor finished the league in fifth place, and Yanal departed at the end of the season.

Before the 2015–16 season, Shota Arveladze was appointed head coach but resigned after an 11th-week loss to İstanbul Başakşehir. On 6 December 2015, Muharrem Usta was elected president. The team was temporarily managed by Sadi Tekelioğlu until the mid-season break, after which Hami Mandıralı returned as head coach. During this period, Trabzonspor faced financial difficulties and disputes over player payments, leading to some foreign players leaving before the season ended. The team finished the league with 12 wins, 4 draws, and 18 losses, totaling 40 points and finishing in 12th place. They suffered their worst defeat in league history, losing 7–0 to Antalyaspor in the 33rd week. Hami Mandıralı resigned after the match.

Ahead of the 2016–17 season, Ersun Yanal returned for his third stint as head coach. Under the leadership of president Muharrem Usta, Trabzonspor initiated a restructuring process ahead of the club’s 50th anniversary. Many players were released, and due to financial restrictions imposed by UEFA, the club focused on signing low-cost players. After a disappointing first half of the season, finishing 13th with 18 points, Trabzonspor strengthened their squad during the mid-season break. Moving to their new stadium, Şenol Güneş Stadium, the team improved significantly, climbing to fifth place. Trabzonspor played their first official match at Şenol Güneş Stadium on 29 January 2017, defeating Gaziantepspor 4–0, with Fabian Castillo scoring the first goal in the new stadium’s history. Trabzonspor suffered their first defeat at the new stadium on 8 April 2017, losing 4–3 to Beşiktaş.

In the 2018–19 season, Ahmet Ağaoğlu was elected as president, highlighting the club’s financial difficulties. Under Ağaoğlu’s leadership, the club restructured its debts, and Ünal Karaman, a club legend from the 1990s, was appointed head coach. Despite injuries to key players and a transfer ban during the mid-season window, the team finished fourth, five points behind champions Galatasaray. However, a crisis between Karaman and Ağaoğlu at the end of 2019 led to Karaman’s resignation, and assistant coach Hüseyin Çimşir, who had previously won the league with Bursaspor as a player, was appointed as head coach.

=== 2020s: Resurgence and the Long-Awaited Championship ===

In the 2019–20 season, thanks to debt restructuring and appropriate transfers, the team became one of the strongest candidates for the championship from the beginning of the season. It experienced its brightest period in the last 10 years, entering the break due to the COVID-19 pandemic as league leaders with 8 weeks remaining. However, just before the season resumed, Trabzonspor was banned from European competitions by UEFA for violating financial fair play regulations. Following the pandemic break, the team experienced a performance drop and on 19 July 2020, missed out on what was its closest shot at the championship in 36 years. At the end of the season, İstanbul Başakşehir claimed the title. After the loss of the championship, head coach Hüseyin Çimşir was dismissed, and his assistant, Eddie Newton, was appointed as the new head coach. That season, despite narrowly missing the Süper Lig title, Trabzonspor defeated Alanyaspor in the Turkish Cup final, securing the trophy for the first time in 10 years, marking their 9th Turkish Cup victory.

Trabzonspor continued with Eddie Newton for the 2020–21 season. However, after failing to deliver the expected performance in the first 8 weeks, Newton was dismissed, and the club signed Abdullah Avcı as head coach. Under Eddie Newton’s management, the team had dropped to the relegation zone, but with Abdullah Avcı’s arrival, Trabzonspor climbed to 4th place and finished the season in that position. Additionally, the Turkish Super Cup, which had been postponed the previous season due to the pandemic, was played on 27 January 2021, and Trabzonspor defeated İstanbul Başakşehir to claim the trophy for the 9th time in their history.

In the 40 matches played in the league that season, Trabzonspor recorded 19 wins, 14 draws, and 7 losses, amassing 71 points to finish 4th. This result earned them a place in the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League starting from the third qualifying round. However, in the 2020–21 Turkish Cup, Trabzonspor was eliminated in the 5th round by Adana Demirspor, losing 4–3 on penalties after a 2–2 draw in regular and extra time.

Trabzonspor made a strong start to the 2021–22 Süper Lig season. On 30 April 2022, Trabzonspor clinched the 2021–22 Süper Lig title, marking their first league championship in 38 years. The club’s previous league triumph was in the 1983–84 season, and this historic victory ended nearly four decades of longing for their passionate fanbase. Trabzonspor secured the title after a 2–2 draw with Antalyaspor at their home ground, Şenol Güneş Sports Complex. The result ensured an unassailable lead at the top of the table with three matches remaining in the season.

Under the management of Abdullah Avcı, Trabzonspor demonstrated consistent performances throughout the season, maintaining a dominant position in the league standings. Their balanced squad and tactical discipline were instrumental in their success, with standout performances from key players such as Anastasios Bakasetas and Anthony Nwakaeme.

The championship victory was met with widespread celebrations across Trabzon and among the club’s global supporters. Fans filled the streets of Trabzon, waving the club’s maroon-and-blue colors and chanting songs of triumph. The joyous occasion underscored the significance of the title, which reaffirmed Trabzonspor’s status as one of Turkey’s most historic and successful football clubs.

This title was Trabzonspor’s seventh Süper Lig championship and their first since the introduction of the modern Turkish league format. It also marked a significant moment in Turkish football history, breaking the Istanbul-based dominance of Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, and Galatasaray, which had collectively won every league title since 1984.

==Crest and colours==
In the long-standing rivalry between İdmanocağı and İdmangücü in Trabzon, the dominant colors were Red-Yellow and Green-White, respectively. It was decided that Trabzonspor’s colors should be different from these and should symbolize Trabzon and the Black Sea region. Various options were considered, including holding a competition to decide the colors, but this idea was later abandoned. Lengthy discussions were held day and night, but no conclusion was reached in the first four meetings. By the fifth meeting, tensions were high, and fans had run out of patience.

During these discussions, the then-president of the Turkish Football Federation, Orhan Şeref Apak, attempted to mediate. At a meeting in the office of the Federation’s General Manager, Ulvi Yenal, representatives from both clubs engaged in intense debates about selecting colors that were distinct from those of the rival clubs. Frustrated with the lack of progress, Yenal demanded that each club representative choose one color. As a result, the İdmanocağı group proposed “dark claret,” while the İdmangücü group suggested “light blue.” Ultimately, the founding members of Trabzonspor agreed on the colors Claret and Blue &quot;(“Bordo-Mavi”)&quot;, which became the club’s official colors. The letters “T” and “S” in the club emblem also reflect the identity of Trabzonspor.

Although a number of theories have been put forward as to why the club colours of Trabzonspor are claret and blue, it has been claimed that they were adopted after the club were sent a set of kits by the English club Aston Villa after their formation in 1967.

==Rivalries==

===Rivalries with Istanbul’s “Big Three”===

Trabzonspor’s rivalries with Istanbul’s “big three”—Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray, and Beşiktaş—are deeply rooted in Turkish football history, but their rivalry with Fenerbahçe stands out as the most intense.

The rivalry with Fenerbahçe began in the 1974 Turkish Cup, but it escalated during the 1995–96 season when Trabzonspor lost a critical home match late in the season, surrendering the league title to Fenerbahçe. This moment remains a painful memory for Trabzonspor fans. Tensions reached a boiling point again in the 2010–11 season when the two clubs competed fiercely for the league title. While Fenerbahçe secured the championship, 2011 Turkish football match-fixing allegations led to Fenerbahçe’s European ban, allowing Trabzonspor to make their first UEFA Champions League appearance. The rivalry is fueled by these high-stakes battles, off-field controversies, and the passionate fan bases of both teams, making it one of the most heated in Turkish football.

The rivalry with Galatasaray began in Trabzonspor’s inaugural top-flight season in 1974–75. Over the years, this rivalry has been defined by competitive matches and the contrasting identities of the clubs, with Trabzonspor representing the Anatolian heartland against Galatasaray’s Istanbul dominance. While the intensity doesn’t match that of Fenerbahçe, matches between these two teams remain highly anticipated.

Trabzonspor’s rivalry with Beşiktaş also dates back to the 1970s, with their first league meeting in 1974. While not as fiery as the Fenerbahçe rivalry, the competition with Beşiktaş is characterized by hard-fought matches and the shared ambition to challenge for top honors in Turkish football.

Although Trabzonspor shares rivalries with all three Istanbul giants, the conflict with Fenerbahçe is unparalleled in its history, drama, and impact, solidifying it as the club’s most significant rivalry.

===Rivalry with Samsunspor===

The Samsunspor–Trabzonspor rivalry is a significant contest in the Black Sea region of Turkey. It is fueled by geographical proximity and cultural ties, with both teams representing regional pride. Although Trabzonspor has historically achieved more national success, matches against Samsunspor are marked by high stakes, passionate fan engagement, and regional identity. The rivalry showcases the Black Sea region’s deep footballing traditions and competitive spirit.

==Stadium==


Since December 2016, Trabzonspor has played its home matches at the Şenol Güneş Sports Complex, a state-of-the-art stadium located in Trabzon. The stadium has a capacity of 40,980, offering modern facilities that meet international standards. Named after Şenol Güneş, a legendary figure in Trabzonspor’s history as both a goalkeeper and manager, the complex represents a new era for the club.

The stadium is equipped with advanced technology, including interactive media systems installed in the press areas, and regularly hosts important national and international football matches. It also serves as a symbol of Trabzonspor’s growth and ambition, as well as a hub for the city’s sports and cultural activities. Plans are underway to connect the stadium to Trabzon’s city center through a new tram project, improving accessibility for fans and visitors.

Prior to moving to the Şenol Güneş Sports Complex, Trabzonspor played its home matches at the Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadium, which had a capacity of 24,169. Built in 1951, the stadium served as Trabzonspor’s home ground until January 2017. Over its long history, the venue underwent several renovations to expand its capacity and modernize its facilities, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.

Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadium holds a special place in Trabzonspor’s history, having hosted countless memorable matches during the club’s golden era. It was also the site of key events like the 1st Black Sea Games and the 2011 European Youth Olympic Games, as well as matches in the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Despite its closure, the stadium remains an iconic symbol of Trabzonspor’s roots and legacy.

<text>Sir John Stanley (c. 1386–1437) was Knight, Sheriff of Anglesey, Constable of Carnarvon, Justice of Chester, Steward of Macclesfield and titular [[King of Mann]], the second of that name.

==Biography==
His father Sir John Stanley I, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, had been granted the tenure of the Isle of Man, to him and his heirs, by Henry IV, and the younger Sir John succeeded to the Kingdom in 1414.
He also held the office of Steward of Macclesfield, Cheshire.

He twice visited the Island to put down rebellions (1417 and 1422) and was also responsible for putting the laws of the Island into writing. A brief description is given in Manx Notebook (vol iii p1-4).

A. W. Moore, a Manx antiquary and Speaker of the House of Keys, appraised him as follows:

He purchased the Advowson of Rectory of Winwick, Cheshire from the Nostell Priory, Wakefield in 1433 - from this time onwards, this church, adjacent to his property, was to have close links with the Stanley family.

==Family==
He married Elizabeth Harrington, daughter of Sir Nicholas Harrington.
One of his sons was Sir Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley, and a grandson was Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby.

<text>The People For Internet Responsibility (PFIR) is a global, ad hoc network of individuals concerned about the operations, development, management, and regulation of the Internet in responsible ways, co-founded by Lauren Weinstein and Peter G. Neumann in November, 1999 in California. PFIR is attempting to become a nonprofit 501 (c)(3) corporation, and claims to be nonpartisan, does not partake in lobbying, and has no political agenda. The main goal of PFIR is to be a resource for people around the world to impact critical issues on the Internet that have a significant impact on today&#x27;s societies worldwide. 

== What does PFIR do ==

Regarding Internet issues, PFIR is a resource for analysis, discussion, education, and data that is targeted to aid people from all around the world with successfully participating in the process of internet evolution, use, and control. PFIR uses their website, telephone, email services, workshops, television and radio broadcasts, and other venues in order to provide their resources on a worldwide level.

PFIR believes that there is increasing concern with the extremely rapid commercialization of the World Wide Web, that powerful commercial and political interests that do not necessarily share the concerns of the people at large are irresponsibly skewing decisions in regard to Internet resources. Such areas of concern to PFIR include spam security, freedom of speech, domain name policy, filtering, and other topics.

<doc id="861389" wikidata="Q7384551" url="?curid=861389" title="Ryan Starr">
<text>Tiffany Montgomery (born November 21, 1982), known professionally as Ryan Starr, is a singer who finished seventh on the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. She went on to release a successful single on iTunes and participated in a handful of other television programs, modeling campaigns, and worldwide music tours.

==Early life==
Ryan Starr was born Tiffany Montgomery in the Sunland neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, a place which she once described as a &quot;middle of nowhere town, up in the hills - like, horse country.&quot; Her elementary, middle, and high schools were all about &quot;a block from one another&quot; in her words, and growing up, Starr considered herself to be &quot;a small-town tomboy&quot;. She has three sisters. On her mother&#x27;s side, she is Peruvian and Bolivian. She also has French and Irish ancestry.

Although Starr was named Homecoming Queen, she reminisced in a 2017 blog post that she was &quot;dorky&quot; and &quot;definitely not one of the popular kids&quot; for most of her time in school. She graduated from Verdugo Hills High School in 2000, where she ran track. Before attempting a music career, she worked as a waitress, lifeguard, swim team coach, and at a clothing store.

Around the age of seven, Starr began learning how to sing. Her family was unable to afford formal vocal training, so as a child, Starr developed her voice by singing along to Disney films. Drawn to jazz and blues artists from a young age, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Etta James, Janis Joplin, and Otis Redding were among Starr&#x27;s first musical influences. As Starr got older, she found inspiration in rock musicians, such as Pat Benatar, Chris Cornell, Steve Perry, and Steven Tyler.

==Career==
===&quot;American Idol&quot;===
After graduating from high school, Starr went on frequent bus excursions into Hollywood from her nearby hometown, and on one of these, she met a girl who suggested that the two of them audition for &quot;American Idol&quot; first season together. Starr&#x27;s performance of &quot;Lean on Me&quot; (by Bill Withers) was the first successful audition ever shown on the series. In his 2003 autobiography, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mean to Be Rude, But...&quot;, Simon Cowell wrote that Starr was &quot;cripplingly shy&quot; at the audition, but that Paula Abdul &quot;saw some potential for stardom in her, and decided to mentor her.&quot;

Starr, who auditioned as Tiffany Montgomery, adopted her stage name by Hollywood Week. Placed into Group 1 for the Top 30 semi-finals, her song choice for that round of an old jazz standard, &quot;The Frim-Fram Sauce&quot;, puzzled Cowell and Randy Jackson, although the following night Cowell deemed Starr &quot;a dark horse&quot; and predicted that she could excel in the competition with better singing material. After she was voted through to the Top 10, Starr opened the first round of the finals, singing &quot;If You Really Love Me&quot; by Stevie Wonder; this marked the first live performance in the history of &quot;American Idol&quot;. Starr was well-received by the judges for that performance but was voted off the series two weeks later in seventh place.

The second of Starr&#x27;s live performances, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; by The Kinks, was panned by the judges and resulted in a Bottom 2 placement for that week. While Starr&#x27;s final performance of the competition, &quot;Last Dance&quot; by Donna Summer, was praised by the judges as an improvement over the previous week, it prompted Cowell to reflect on Starr&#x27;s disparate song choices throughout the competition and express confusion over what kind of artist Starr wanted to be. The judges felt that Starr struggled with aspects of her performances throughout every round of the finals but communicated a shared belief in Starr&#x27;s potential. Upon Starr&#x27;s elimination from the competition, Cowell gave Starr an offer to call him anytime for help with pursuing a music career.

====Performances====
*&quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; Nancy Sinatra, (solo part in Group performance)

===Post-&quot;American Idol&quot; music career===
Starr blamed her stalled music career on a two-year restrictive recording contract with RCA. Under this contract, she refused to record an album claiming producers wanted to turn her into an Avril Lavigne type singer. After an intense three year legal battle she was released from contract in 2005.

Upon release from her contract, Starr went on to host &quot;TRL&quot; on VH1. In January 2005, &quot;People&quot; reported that Starr was &quot;shopping a demo record that steers clear of Idol&#x27;s sugary pop tones&quot; and had &quot;recently released&quot; an iTunes exclusive single, &quot;My Religion&quot;, which she co-wrote. According to a 2007 article by the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, &quot;My Religion&quot; was released in 2005, though an earlier article by NCBuy.com reported that &quot;My Religion&quot; was released in September 2004. Although it was reported by the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; in 2008 and by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2011 that &quot;My Religion&quot; peaked at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Digital Songs chart, &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s own records indicate that the song did not actually chart.

<text>Emilio Fede (born 24 June 1931) is an Italian anchorman, journalist and writer. He has been the director of &quot;TG1&quot; (from 1981 to 1982), &quot;Studio Aperto&quot; (from 1991 to 1992), and &quot;TG4&quot; (from 1992 to 2012).

==Biography==
Fede was born in Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, Sicily. He spent part of his youth living in nearby San Piero Patti.
He started his career in the Italian public broadcasting company (RAI) in the early 1950s, and went on to become one of the most popular faces in its news dominant TV market share in Italy. Fede during the direction since 1991 to 2012 of &quot;TG4&quot;, a news programme on Rete 4, owned by Italian tycoon and former premier Silvio Berlusconi, has been often accused of excessive partisanship for Berlusconi in his news management.

Fede is, at present, indicted for favouring prostitution of a minor in the framework of the so-called Rubygate scandal.

==Assault==
On 24 November 2010, Fede was assaulted at a restaurant in Milan&#x27;s city centre by Gian Germano Giuliani, the owner of Giuliani Pharmaceuticals.

== Prison ==
In 2017, Fede was sentenced to jail for three years, six months because of bankruptcy. He was found guilty of pocketing 1.1 million euros that were supposed to be used to prevent Lele Mora&#x27;s agency from going bankrupt. The court ordered him to pay back the money immediately.

<doc id="861395" wikidata="Q724418" url="?curid=861395" title="Matvei Gedenshtrom">
<text>Mathias or Matthias Hedenström (Swedish; 1780 – ), also known by his Russian name Matvei Matveyevich Gedenshtrom (), was a Russian explorer of Northern Siberia, writer, and public servant.

==Life==
Gedenshtrom was born in Riga, then part of the Russian Empire to Mathias Hedenström (1733–1799), a Swedish political refugee from Dalarna. Matvei Gedenshtrom himself was still a Swedish citizen in 1798.

Gedenshtrom attended the University of Tartu. He did not finish his studies and left his alma mater in favor of work at Tallinn customs. Until 1806, he worked in Riga as a translator for Count Friedrich von Buxhoeveden, the Governor-General of the Baltic provinces. In 1808, while working as secretary to a customs inspector, he was arrested in connection with a bribery affair, tried, and then banished to Siberia.
Later that year, Gedenshtrom arrived in Irkutsk and received his first duty assignment by Minister of Commerce Nikolay Rumyantsev, namely, the exploration of the coastline of the Arctic Ocean. Lacking necessary scientific background, Matvei Gedenshtrom had to study a lot in order to be able to reckon a latitude and longitude of a given location and use scientific equipment in general. Gedenshtrom led the cartographic expedition to explore the New Siberian Islands (together with Yakov Sannikov and land surveyors Pyotr Pshenitsyn and Ivan Kozhevin). The theory about the existence of Sannikov Land somewhere northwest of the Kotelny Island originated during this very expedition. Gedenshtrom established the presence of the Siberian polynya – patches of open water in sea ice at the edge of the drifting ice and continental fast ice. In 1809, Gedenshtrom visited the eastern shores of an island, discovered by merchants Semyon and Lev Syrovatsky three years earlier, and named it New Siberia (this name would be officially endorsed in 1810). Gedenshtrom charted the coastline between the mouths of the rivers Yana and Kolyma. He also made many trips across Yakutia and areas east of the Lake Baikal.

In 1813, Matvei Gedenshtrom was employed by the secretariat of Irkutsk governor. Later on, he was appointed head of district police (исправник) in Verkhne-Udinsk, which did not distract him from scientific research and compiling his mineralogical and botanic collection. Matvei Gedenshtrom was a smart, talented, educated, and kind man, who often helped local peasants with advice and money. However, he was also known to have been an immoral person and a squanderer. He was one of the closest associates of Nikolai Treskin (then-governor of Irkutsk) and made a sizeable fortune on bread purchases assigned to him by the governor&#x27;s office. In 1819, Mikhail Speransky (governor general of Siberia) paid a visit to Irkutsk as part of his Siberian tour and exposed many instances of official misconduct by local authorities. On 20 February 1820, Matvei Gedenshtrom was removed from his post for his autocratic style of management, embezzlement, extortion, and fraud. Speransky&#x27;s report on his findings was examined by a special committee, established on 28 July 1821. The committee divided all of the offenders into ten categories. Gedenshtrom found himself in the third category, which meant he could never again be admitted to hold any public posts and had to be banished to an inner guberniya (European Russia). However, it was soon decided not to send him away from Siberia and settle him in Tobolsk. Willing to take advantage of Matvei Gedenshtrom&#x27;s skills and experience, the administration of Western Siberia managed to obtain permission for him to join the public service. In 1827, Gedenshtrom was allowed to return to European Russia and then employed by the Medical Service Corps (Медицинский департамент) as a section chief. In the 1830s, Matvei Gedenshtrom was appointed a postmaster in Tomsk. Upon his retirement, he moved to a village of Kaidukovaya near Tomsk and spent the rest of his days drinking.

Matvei Gedenshtrom died in extreme poverty on 20 September 1845, at the age of 65. He was interred in Tomsk three days later.

==Works==

Matvei Gedenshtrom published his scientific findings in several separate works and articles:

* &quot;Gedenshtrom’s Journey Across the Arctic Ocean and its Islands, Which Lie to the East of the Lena’s Estuary&quot; (Путешествие Геденштрома по Ледовитому морю и островам онаго, лежащим от устья Лены к востоку; 1822)

<doc id="861398" wikidata="Q1423935" url="?curid=861398" title="Macintosh Toolbox">
<text>The Macintosh Toolbox implements many of the high-level features of the Classic Mac OS, including a set of application programming interfaces for software development on the platform. The Toolbox consists of a number of &quot;managers,&quot; software components such as QuickDraw, responsible for drawing onscreen graphics, and the Menu Manager, which maintain data structures describing the menu bar. As the original Macintosh was designed without virtual memory or memory protection, it was important to classify code according to when it should be loaded into memory or kept on disk, and how it should be accessed. The Toolbox consists of subroutines essential enough to be permanently kept in memory and accessible by a two-byte machine instruction; however it excludes core &quot;kernel&quot; functionality such as memory management and the file system. Note that the Toolbox does not &quot;draw&quot; the menu onscreen: menus were designed to have a customizable appearance, so the drawing code was stored in a resource, which could be on a disk.

== Advent and implementation ==
=== On 68k systems ===
The original Motorola 68000 family implementation of the Macintosh operating system executes system calls using that processor&#x27;s illegal opcode exception handling mechanism. Motorola specified that instructions beginning with &quot;1111&quot; and &quot;1010&quot; would never be used in future 68000 family processors, thus freeing them for use as such by an operating system. Further, they each had their own dedicated interrupt vector, separate from the generic illegal opcode handler. As &quot;1111&quot; was reserved for use by &quot;co&quot;-processors such as the 68881 FPU, Apple chose &quot;1010&quot; (&quot;A&quot; in hexadecimal) as the prefix for operating system calls. Handling illegal instructions is known as &quot;trapping&quot;, so these special instructions were called &quot;A-traps&quot;. When the processor encounters such an instruction, it transfers control to the operating system, which looks up the appropriate task and performs it. There were two advantages to this mechanism:

* It results in compact programs. Only two bytes are taken by every operating system access, in contrast to four or six when using regular jump instructions.
* The table used to look up the appropriate function is stored in RAM. Then, even if the underlying code was stored in ROM, it could still be overridden (&quot;patched&quot;) by replacing the ROM memory address with a RAM address.

The system was further optimized by allotting some bits of the A-trap instruction to store parameters to the most common functions. For example, memory allocation is a very common task, so it should be expressed in as few bytes of code as possible. Sometimes the programmer wants to clear the memory block to zeros, so either the allocation function should take a boolean parameter, or there should be two allocation functions. To pass a parameter would require an additional two-byte instruction, which would be inefficient. Having two functions would require at least an extra four bytes of RAM used for the address in the function look-up table. The most efficient solution is to map multiple A-traps to the same subroutine, which then uses the A-trap as a parameter. This is true of the most commonly used subroutines. However, the Toolbox was composed of the &quot;less&quot; commonly used subroutines. The Toolbox was defined as the set of subroutines which took no parameters within the A-trap, and were indexed from a 1024-entry, 4-kilobyte dispatch table. (Machines shipped with less than one megabyte of RAM use a single table of 512 entries, which corresponds to the 256-entry OS dispatch table of later ROM revisions.)

=== On PowerPC systems ===
In 1994, Apple released Macintoshes using the PowerPC architecture, which lacked hardware support for the A-trap mechanism available on 68k systems. Because of their use in applying software patches, however, the dispatch tables were retained. The API library code underlying any Toolbox routine then does nothing except reference the dispatch table. The dispatch table linked only to emulated 68000 family code. Toolbox functions implemented in native PowerPC code have to first disable the emulator using the Mixed Mode Manager. For the sake of uniformity and extensibility, new function entries even continued to be added to the Toolbox after the PowerPC transition.

An alternative mechanism did exist, however, in the Code Fragment Manager, which was used to load and dynamically link native PowerPC programs. The PowerPC system call facility, analogous to the A-trap mechanism, was used to interface with the Mac OS nanokernel, which offered few services directly useful to applications.

== Functionality ==
=== Programming interfaces ===
The Toolbox is composed of commonly used functions, but not the &quot;most&quot; commonly used functions. As a result, it grew into a hodgepodge of different API libraries. The Toolbox encompasses most of the basic functionality which distinguished the Classic Mac OS. Apple&#x27;s references “Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials” and “Inside Macintosh: More Macintosh Toolbox”, similarly vague in scope, also document most of the Toolbox.

=== Use in booting ===
Because much of the Toolbox is implemented in ROM, alongside the computer&#x27;s firmware, it was convenient to use as a bootloader environment. In conjunction with resources stored on the ROM chip, the Toolbox can turn the screen gray, show a dialog box with the signature &quot;Welcome to Macintosh&quot; greeting, and display the mouse cursor. By using Toolbox to help boot the machine, a rudimentary Mac-like environment can be initialized before ever loading the System suitcase from disk (in fact before ROMs on NuBus cards were executed), which is when the decision to use 24-bit or 32-bit addressing has to be made. (System 7&#x27;s support for 32-bit addressing requires 32-bit clean ROMs, as older Mac ROMs do not have support for this). The need for diagnostics as in the BIOS resident for IBM PC compatibles&#x27; boards is not necessary since the Macintosh has most of its diagnostics in POST and automatically reports errors via the &quot;Sad Mac&quot; codes.

The similarity between the boot-up environment and the actual operating system should not be confused with being identical, however. Although the &quot;Classic Mac OS&quot; boot process is convoluted and largely undocumented, it is not more limited than an IBM PC compatible BIOS. Like a PC&#x27;s master boot record, a ROM-based Mac reads and executes code from the first blocks (&quot;boot blocks&quot;) of the disk partition selected as the boot device. The boot blocks then verify that a suitable rudimentary environment exists, and use it to load the System suitcase. A different operating system with a different file system can boot by simply using its own code in the boot blocks. This system was not used for PowerPC Linux, however, because Open Firmware in New World ROM machines requires a bootloader within an HFS filesystem—a reason having nothing to do with the Toolbox or &quot;old-fashioned&quot; Macs in general. More narrowly, the Startup Disk control panel in the Classic Mac OS and later macOS only allows the user to select a mounted filesystem with very particular constraints.

== Legacy ==
In Mac OS X, the Toolbox is not used at all, though the Classic Environment loads the Toolbox ROM file into its virtual machine. Much of the Toolbox was restructured and implemented as part of Apple&#x27;s Carbon programming API, allowing programmers familiar with the Toolbox to port their program code more easily to Mac OS X.

<text>Metamorphic code is code that when run outputs a logically equivalent version of its own code under some interpretation. This is similar to a quine, except that a quine&#x27;s source code is exactly equivalent to its own output. Metamorphic code also usually outputs machine code and not its own source code.

==Overview==
Metamorphic code is used by computer viruses to avoid the pattern recognition of anti-virus software. Metamorphic viruses often translate their own binary code into a temporary representation, editing the temporary representation of themselves and then translate the edited form back to machine code again. This procedure is done with the virus itself, and thus also the metamorphic engine itself undergoes changes, which means that no part of the virus stays the same. This differs from polymorphic code, where the polymorphic engine can not rewrite its own code. 

Metamorphic code is used by some viruses when they are about to infect new files, and the result is that the next generation will never look like current generation. The mutated code will do exactly the same thing (under the interpretation used), but the child&#x27;s binary representation will typically be completely different from the parent&#x27;s. Mutation can be achieved using techniques like inserting NOP instructions (brute force), changing what registers to use, changing flow control with jumps, changing machine instructions to equivalent ones or reordering independent instructions.

Metamorphism does not protect a virus against heuristic analysis.

Metamorphic code can also mean that a virus is capable of infecting executables from two or more different operating systems (such as Windows and Linux) or even different computer architectures. Often, the virus does this by carrying several viruses within itself. The beginning of the virus is then coded so that it translates to correct machine-code for all of the platforms that it is supposed to execute in. This is used primarily in remote exploit injection code where the target platform is unknown.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney J58 (company designation JT11D-20) is an American jet engine that powered the Lockheed A-12, and subsequently the YF-12 and the SR-71 aircraft. It was an afterburning turbojet engine with a unique compressor bleed to the afterburner that gave increased thrust at high speeds. Because of the wide speed range of the aircraft, the engine needed two modes of operation to take it from stationary on the ground to at altitude. It was a conventional afterburning turbojet for take-off and acceleration to Mach 2 and then used permanent compressor bleed to the afterburner above Mach 2. The way the engine worked at cruise led it to be described as &quot;acting like a turboramjet&quot;. It has also been described as a turboramjet based on incorrect statements describing the turbomachinery as being completely bypassed.

The engine performance that met the mission requirements for the CIA and USAF over many years was later enhanced slightly for NASA experimental work (carrying external payloads on the top of the aircraft), which required more thrust to deal with higher aircraft drag.

==Development==
===Origins===
The J58, company designation JT11, had its origins in the larger JT9 (J91) engine. It was a 3/4 scale JT9 with a mass flow of , down from . The JT11 was proposed to the US Navy under their designation J58. It was also proposed for various Navy and Air Force aircraft, e.g. Convair F-106, North American F-108, Convair B-58C, Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III, and North American A3J Vigilante, but none of these applications followed.

The J58 began development for the US Navy to power the planned Martin P6M jet flying boat. The P6M started out using Allison J71-A-4 engines and then switched to the Pratt &amp; Whitney J75, due to J58 development delays. Upon cancellation of the P6M, it was selected for the Convair Kingfish and for the Lockheed A-12, YF-12A and SR-71. Other sources link its origin to the USAF&#x27;s requirement for a powerplant for the WS-110A, the future XB-70 Valkyrie.

===Re-design for Mach 3.2===
Analytical calculations of the performance of the original J58 showed three problems at Mach 2.5: &quot;exhaust pressure was equal to the inlet pressure, the compressor was deep in surge, and there was no cool air to the afterburner liner that would therefore melt&quot;.

The first problem was caused by excessive compressor delivery temperatures, which did not allow enough energy to be added in the engine combustor to provide any thrust from the gas generator. All the thrust-producing pressure in the jet-pipe came from ram, as with a ramjet, and none from the gas generator. Fuel for thrust could only be added in the afterburner, which became the only source of engine thrust. The speed at which the gas generator produced no thrust was raised from about Mach 2.5 to about Mach 3 by patented design changes. Beyond that speed, the gas generator would become a drag item with, at Mach 3.2, a pressure ratio of 0.9. Even minimum afterburner would not balance the drag. The effect was described qualitatively by Lockheed inlet designer David Campbell &quot;..with minimum afterburner the engine would be dragging on the engine mounts at high Mach numbers.&quot;

The second problem (the compressor deep in surge) was caused by the compressor trying to operate at too-low a corrected speed in an area of its compressor map known as &quot;off-design&quot;. The third problem was caused by the afterburner duct being cooled with too-hot turbine exhaust gas.

 describes the changes to the engine that extended the engine&#x27;s capability to Mach 3.2. They included diverting 20% of the compressor entry air after the 4th compressor stage directly to the afterburner through six external tubes. This allowed the compressor to work properly with adequate surge margin and increased airflow into the compressor. Some of the increased flow left the compressor after the 4th stage as bypass to the afterburner, and some left the last compressor stage through the previously choked area. The increased airflow gave more thrust. The inlet guide vanes were modified with trailing-edge flaps to reduce blade flutter and prevent blade fatigue failures. The afterburner was cooled by the bleed air that was cooler than the turbine exhaust gas. Not all the oxygen in the bleed air was available for combustion, as most of the bleed air was directed into the cooling shroud before entering the afterburner cavity for reheating. The improved afterburner cooling allowed a higher flame temperature, which gave more thrust.

The engine was completely redesigned, except for the compressor and turbine aerodynamic definitions, so that it would be reliable running for prolonged periods at unprecedented temperatures, not only inside the engine but also surrounding the casings where the controls, accessories, electrical wiring and fuel and oil tubes were located.

===Starting===
Two starting methods were used during the life of the A-12, YF-12 and SR-71 aircraft: an AG330 starter cart with two Buick V8 engines driving a common output shaft, or compressed air driving a small starter adapter. The air-start method superseded the cumbersome &quot;Buicks&quot; when better compressed air supplies became available.

===Fuel===
Any aircraft flying at three times the speed of sound is in a severe thermal environment, both from frictional heating and stagnation ram rise. The fuel was the only heat sink available to the aircraft and after absorbing , keeping everything cool enough from the crew to the exhaust nozzle area indicator, it was supplied to the fuel nozzles at . To cope with these high temperatures, a new jet fuel called JP-7 with a low vapor pressure had to be developed. A chemical method for igniting the fuel, triethyl borane (TEB), was developed to match its low volatility. TEB spontaneously ignites in contact with air above −5 °C. The engine and afterburner were lit with TEB and the afterburner also had a catalytic igniter that glowed in the hot turbine exhaust. Each engine carried a nitrogen-pressurized sealed tank with of TEB, sufficient for at least 16 starts, restarts, or afterburner lights; this number was one of the limiting factors of SR-71 endurance, as after each air refueling the afterburners had to be reignited. When the pilot moved the throttle from cut-off to idle position, fuel flowed into the engine, and shortly afterwards an approx. shot of TEB was injected into the combustion chamber, where it spontaneously ignited and lit the fuel with a green flash. In some conditions, however, the TEB flow was obstructed by coking deposits on the injector nozzle, hindering restart attempts. Refilling the TEB tank was a perilous task; the maintenance crew wore silver fire suits. Conversely, the JP-7 fueling was so safe that some aircraft maintenance was permitted during filling. The chemical ignition was chosen instead of a conventional igniter for reliability reasons, and to reduce mechanical complexity. The TEB tank is cooled with fuel flowing around it, and contains a disk that ruptures in case of overpressure, allowing TEB and nitrogen to discharge into the afterburner.

One heat source required two-stage reduction. Before entering the fuel heat-sink system, the Environmental Control System (ECS) air leaving the engine compressor at was so hot that ram air at had to be used first. Fuel flowing from the tanks to the engines was used to cool the air conditioning systems, aircraft hydraulic fluid, engine oil, accessory drive system oil, the TEB tank and afterburner nozzle actuator control lines.

===Materials===
The development of the J58 involved some of the most challenging metallurgical development problems experienced by Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft so far, with components operating at unprecedented temperatures and levels of stress and durability. New manufacturing techniques as well as new alloys improved the mechanical properties, and surface coatings had to be developed to protect components.

Premature cracking of turbine vanes and blades made from conventionally cast (i.e. equiaxed) Mar-M200, the strongest cast nickel-base alloy, was avoided by the development of directionally solidified parts cast in the same material. Directionally solidified Mar-M200 became the strongest cast turbine material to date and was introduced in production engines. Single-crystal turbine blades cast in Mar-M200, giving further improvement of high temperature resistance, would also be developed through testing in J58 engines. Waspaloy was the most widely used alloy in the engine, from critical high-energy rotating compressor discs to components made from sheet. Although used for turbine discs in other engines, it did not have the required properties for J58 turbine discs. Astroloy, the strongest known nickel-base superalloy in the Western world at that time, was used instead. Waspaloy was also used initially for the diffuser case, the part that joins the compressor to the combustor and that contains the highest pressure in the engine. Diffuser case weld cracking led to the introduction of Inconel 718 for this part. The afterburner liner was sprayed with ceramic thermal barrier coating that, together with the cooling air from the compressor, allowed continuous use of the afterburner with flame temperatures up to .

===Performance enhancement for NASA===
NASA was loaned 2 SR-71 aircraft for research work. One was modified to flight-test a Linear Aerospike rocket engine and was fitted with thrust-enhanced J58 engines. Engine thrust was increased by 5% to offset increased aircraft drag. The increased thrust came from a throttle push, or exhaust gas temperature uptrim, of . The increase was limited by the allowable reduction in life of the second-stage turbine blades (the life-limiting component) from 400 to 50 hours. The same thrust-enhancement studies used for this work also looked at an additional 5% thrust from additional afterburner fuel made possible with oxidizer injection (nitrous oxide). The nitrous oxide rate would have been limited by thermal choking of the nozzle.

===Legacy===
, the J58 is the only known aircraft engine designed to operate continuously at maximum afterburning at high Mach number cruise. J58 experience was used extensively in the JTF17 engine proposal for a Mach 2.7 SST, due to significant flight time at Mach 2.7 and above. It was also used for subsequent engines developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney, both commercial and military. The next afterburning engine, the TF30 as installed in the F-111, used an airframe-mounted secondary nozzle with free-floating flaps similar to that used on the SR-71.

J58 emissions were measured as part of the NASA Stratospheric Wake Experiment, which looked at the environmental impact of using afterburning jet engines for supersonic transports. An engine was tested in an altitude chamber at a maximum condition of full afterburning at Mach 3.0 and 19.8 km altitude.

==Design==
===Contemporary compressor solutions for Mach 3 flight===
Alternative solutions to combat the adverse effects of high inlet temperature on the aerodynamic performance of the compressor were rejected by the Pratt &amp; Whitney patentee, Robert Abernethy. One of those solutions was used in a contemporary installation. The GE YJ93/XB-70 used a variable-stator compressor to avoid front-stage stall and rear-stage choking.

Another possible solution, pre-compressor cooling, was used on the MiG-25&#x27;s R-15 engines. Water/methanol was injected from a spray mast in front of the compressor to lower the intake temperature for short durations at maximum speed. Pre-compressor cooling was also proposed for a Mach 3 reconnaissance Phantom and the Mach 3+ F-106 RASCAL project.

===Propulsion system===

The propulsion system consisted of the intake, engine, nacelle or secondary airflow and ejector nozzle (propelling nozzle). The propulsive thrust distribution between these components changed with flight speed: at Mach 2.2 inlet 13% – engine 73% – ejector 14%; at Mach 3.0+ inlet 54% – engine 17.6% – ejector 28.4%.

====Intake====

The intake had to supply air to the engine with acceptable pressure loss and distortion. It had to do this in all flight conditions.

====Nacelle airflow and ejector nozzle====
The ejector, or secondary, nozzle performed the reverse function of the inlet accelerating the turbine exhaust from about Mach 1.0, as it left the primary nozzle, back up to Mach 3. Mach 3 exhaust velocity is higher than Mach 3 flight velocity due to the much-higher temperature in the exhaust. The nacelle airflow from the intake controlled the expansion of the hot engine exhaust in the ejector nozzle. This air flowed around the engine and served also to cool the hot external parts of the engine and to purge any combustible mixtures in the event of a fuel or oil leak in the nacelle.

;JT11-5A: Proposed version with 32,800 lbs. thrust in afterburner; Mach 3+ capability.
;JT11-7: Proposed version with 32,800 lbs. thrust with afterburner; Mach 4 capability.

<text>Epping and Ongar Rural District was a rural district in the county of Essex, England from 1955 to 1974.

==Creation==
It was created in 1955 by the merger of the disbanded Ongar Rural District and most of the disbanded Epping Rural District, except the civil parishes of Great Parndon, Harlow, Latton, Little Parndon and Netteswell, which were largely transferred to the newly created Harlow Urban District reflecting its new town status. The Epping and Ongar administration was based in Epping.

==List of parishes==

==Abolition==

At the time of its dissolution it consisted of 29 civil parishes. Since 1 April 1974 it has formed part of the District of Epping Forest, except for the civil parishes of Blackmore, Doddinghurst, Kelvedon Hatch, Navestock and Stondon Massey, which became part of the Borough of Brentwood.

<doc id="861408" wikidata="Q907237" url="?curid=861408" title="Brazilian merganser">
<text>The Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus) is a South American diving duck in the &quot;Mergus&quot; genus.
It is one of the most threatened waterfowl species in the world, with possibly fewer than 250 birds in the wild and a small number kept in captivity in Brazil. It has a long, sharp-edged beak with a great number of tooth-like edges.

==Description==
This merganser is a dark, slender duck with a shiny dark-green hood with a long crest, which is usually shorter and more worn-looking in females. Upperparts are dark grey while the breast is light grey, getting paler toward the whitish belly, and a white speculum is particularly noticeable in flight. It has a long thin jagged black bill with red feet and legs. Although females are smaller with a shorter bill and crest, both sexes are alike in color. The slender ducks range in size from as an adult. Young Brazilian mergansers are mainly black with white throat and breast.
The Brazilian mergansers are generally silent birds, but may make barking calls in certain situations. Four calls have been recorded. A harsh &quot;krack-krack&quot; acts as an alarm call emitted in flight. Males make a barking dog-like call, females make a harsh &quot;rrr-rrrr&quot; and the contact call is a soft &quot;rak-rak-rak&quot;. Ducklings give a high pitched &quot;ik-ik-ik&quot;.

Depending on the availability of suitable nesting and feeding sites, Brazilian merganser pairs occupy permanent territories of stretches of rivers. Tree cavities, rock crevices, or disused burrows predominantly made by armadillos are the ideal places for these mergansers to build their nests. It is thought the breeding season is during the austral winter, when rain is minimal and water levels are low, but it may vary geographically. The Brazilian merganser usually lays three to six eggs in June and July, with the chicks hatching during the following July and August. The young are capable of flight by September and/or October. Only the female birds incubate the eggs, but both parents care for the young. This is a very unusual behavior in ducks for both parents to help raise the young birds including direct provision of food to young. Adult Brazilian mergansers are believed to remain on the same territory all year round, but there is not very much information about their movements and dispersal, so information on this is presently speculative in nature.
Fish is the Brazilian merganser&#x27;s main food, and they also eat molluscs, insects and their larvae. The birds, usually in pairs, capture fish by diving in river rapids and backwater.

==Population==
The merganser population is believed to have less than 250 birds. Originally, the duck&#x27;s geographical distribution comprised central-south Brazil and adjacent regions in Paraguay and Argentina. Currently, all confirmed populations are located in Brazil and a more recent population in Argentina and information on most populations is very scarce. The Brazilian merganser population in the Serra da Canastra region is the most significant and best known, with populations occurring hundreds of kilometers away from each other. There are 47 individuals—28 adults and 19 young—in the Serra de Canastra region as of 2006. Most mergansers are found in the Serra da Canastra National Park. 70 birds have been seen near the park&#x27;s headquarters in rio São Francisco. In Jalapão region are estimated 13 individuals in Novo river on 2009/2010 (four couples and some solitary adults).
In 2002, the species was also found on the Arroyo Uruzu in Misiones, Argentina, the first record in the country for ten years, despite extensive surveys done by local researchers conducted throughout previous years. The bird was last reported seen in 1984 in Paraguay, where very little habitat remains; however some local reports show that a few individuals may still be living in the area.

==Habitat==
The slender Brazilian mergansers live in low densities in remote and mountainous regions where it inhabits clean rivers and streams with river rapids and riparian vegetation. Brazilian mergansers are very territorial birds defending large stretches of river and the land surrounding the fast-flowing water. They are recognized as a resident species that does not abandon the watercourses where it established its territory. They do not move or want to move once their habitats have disappeared. The birds need large territories and their habitat is fast dwindling.

==Threat==
The Brazilian mergansers are very sensitive to habitat degradation and loss primarily due to human actions. A major threat to the birds&#x27; survival is the issue of silting of rivers caused by the expansion of farming activities, mining, watershed degradation and soil erosion, as well as deforestation.
Current traditional soil management and use practices in the region from farming may bring about serious damage regarding conservation of natural resources, especially water, on which the Brazilian mergansers and the farmers themselves are dependent. One of the farming practices here is shifting cultivation. It is common in the region to see farmers burning forest areas causing environmental damage to the natural vegetation and soils and the resident species. 
A new threat to the species includes the installation of hydroelectric plants. Hydropower plants are planned to be built in the same rivers that Brazilian mergansers have been found in Paraná (rio Tibagi), Goiás (rio Paranã) and Tocantins (rio Novo). The hydropower plants are a major threat to the birds&#x27; survival because the plants transform systems such as creeks, rivers and streams into turbid lake systems. The project has government backing in spite of the damage it may cause.
Dam-building has also become a major part in the disappearance of these birds. The filling of the Urugua-i reservoir, which took place between 1989 and 1991, had a major impact on Brazilian mergansers in Argentina. The population declined drastically when its fast-flowing rivers were turned into large lakes. After the Urugua-i dam was built, the birds have only been seen on the Uruzu stream, a tributary of the Urugua-i. The dams flood suitable habitat, especially in Brazil and Paraguay, where the Brazilian mergansers build their nests and lay their eggs.

Another threat to the Brazilian merganser is tourism. The scenic beauty of Serra de Canastra National Park brings people from around the world to see the ecotourism landmark. Tourists are attracted to the abundant supply of clear water with over 150 waterfalls in the area. Sporting activities also create a disturbance for the Brazilian mergansers. Activities such as canoeing and rafting disturb the natural habitats for the Brazilian mergansers that thrive on the rapid-rivers, interrupting breeding patterns. Water pollution and deforestation are also a concern as new facilities are built.

Other threats include inbreeding, pesticides and predation. Very few individuals survive from these threats and extinction may be imminent. People hunting the birds for food and collecting them for exhibition specimens contributed to the decline of the species.

<text>Jonathan Kozol (born September 5, 1936) is an American writer, progressive activist, and educator, best known for his books on public education in the United States.

==Education and experience==

Born to Harry Kozol and Ruth (Massell) Kozol, Jonathan graduated from Noble and Greenough School in 1954, and Harvard University &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1958 with an A.B. in English literature. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford. He did not, however, complete his scholarship, deciding instead to go to Paris to learn to write fiction and nonfiction from experienced authors such as William Styron, Richard Wright, and others who were living in Paris at the time. It was upon his return that he began to tutor children in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and soon became a teacher in the Boston Public Schools. He was fired for teaching a Langston Hughes poem, as described in &quot;Death at an Early Age&quot;, and then became deeply involved in the civil rights movement. After being fired from Boston Public Schools, he was offered a position to teach at Newton Public Schools, the school district he attended as a child, and taught there for several years before becoming more deeply involved in social justice work and dedicating more time to writing. Kozol is of Jewish heritage.

Kozol has since held two Guggenheim Fellowships, has twice been a fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation, and has also received fellowships from the Field and Ford Foundations.

Kozol also has worked in the field of social psychology. He has been working with children in inner-city schools for more than forty years. Kozol is currently on the editorial board of &quot;Greater Good Magazine&quot;, published by the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Kozol&#x27;s contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.

==Writing career==

&quot;Death at an Early Age&quot;, his first non-fiction book, is a description of his first year as a teacher in the Boston Public Schools. It was published in 1967 and won the National Book Award in Science, Philosophy and Religion. It has sold more than two million copies in the United States and Europe.

Among the other books by Kozol are &quot;Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America&quot;, which received the Robert F. Kennedy Book award for 1989 and the Conscience-in-Media Award of the American Society of Journalists and Authors, and &quot;Savage Inequalities: Children in America&#x27;s Schools&quot;, which won the New England Book Award and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992.

His 1995 book, &quot;Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a Nation&quot;, described his visits to the South Bronx of New York City, the poorest congressional district in the United States. It received the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award in 1996.

He published &quot;Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope&quot; in 2000 and &quot;The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America&quot; was released September 13, 2005. Kozol documents the continuing and often worsening segregation in public schools in the United States, and the increasing influence of neoconservative ideology on the way children, particularly children of color and poor children of urban areas, are educated.

<doc id="861412" wikidata="Q4566248" url="?curid=861412" title="1948 Democratic National Convention">
<text>The 1948 Democratic National Convention was held at Philadelphia Convention Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from July 12 to July 15, 1948, and resulted in the nominations of President Harry S. Truman for a full term and Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky for vice president in the 1948 presidential election.

One of the decisive factors in convening both major party conventions in Philadelphia that year was that the eastern Pennsylvania area was part of the newly developing broadcast television market. In 1947, TV stations in New York City, Washington and Philadelphia were connected by a coaxial cable. By the summer of 1948 two of the three new television networks, NBC and CBS, had the ability to telecast along the east coast live gavel-to-gavel coverage of both conventions. In television&#x27;s early days, live broadcasts were not routinely recorded, but a few minutes of Kinescope film of the conventions has survived.

==Keynote speech==
The convention was called to order by the permanent chairman, Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky. With delegates demoralized by Republican wins in 1946 that had given them control of Congress, and what appeared to be Truman&#x27;s slim chance for reelection in his own right, on July 13 Barkley gave the keynote speech, as he had in 1932 and 1936. He roused the delegates with his opening declaration &quot;We have assembled here for a great purpose. We are here to give the American people an accounting of our stewardship in the administration of their affairs for sixteen outstanding, eventful years, for not one of which we make an apology!&quot; Barkley continued by recalling the bad times of the Great Depression of the 1930s to turn the Republicans&#x27; most-repeated attack back on them. Republicans proposed &quot;to clean the cobwebs&quot; from the federal government. Said Barkley: &quot;I am not an expert on cobwebs. But if my memory does not betray me, when the Democratic party took over ... sixteen years ago, even the spiders were so weak from starvation they could not weave a cobweb in any department of the government in Washington!&quot; Barkley concluded his hour-long oration with a visionary call for the Democrats to &quot;lead the children of men ... into a free world and a free life,&quot; which inspired the delegates to cheer for more than 30 minutes. His rhetorical effort had the effect of energizing delegates, who began to recover their enthusiasm. It also had the effect of propelling Barkley towards the vice presidential nomination.

==Dispute over civil rights==

On July 14, Northern Democrats led by Minneapolis Mayor Hubert Humphrey and Illinois Senate candidate Paul Douglas pushed for the convention to adopt a strong civil rights platform plank and endorse President Truman&#x27;s pro-civil rights actions. They were opposed by conservatives opposed to racial integration and by moderates who feared alienating Southern voters (regarded as essential to a Democratic victory), including some of Truman&#x27;s own aides. They were supported by northeastern urban Democratic leaders, who thought the plank would appeal to the growing black vote in their cities, traditionally Republican.

In a speech to the convention, Humphrey urged the Democratic Party to &quot;get out of the shadow of states&#x27; rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights.&quot; The convention adopted the civil rights plank in a close vote (651½–582½).

The southern delegates planned on conducting a walkout during the roll call vote on the party&#x27;s platform starting with the Alabama delegation, but Sam Rayburn, chair of the convention, instead used a voice vote as he believed a walkout would ruin Truman&#x27;s presidential campaign. Only 35 of the 278 southern delegates, thirteen from Alabama and the entire twenty-two member Mississippi delegation, left the convention on July 15. 23 of Alabama&#x27;s 30 alternate delegates also left. The remaining southern delegates gave their support to Senator Richard Russell Jr. on the presidential ballot, with North Carolina being the only Southern state to give Truman any delegates.

The bolted delegates and other Southerners then formed the States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party (&quot;Dixiecrats&quot;), which nominated Strom Thurmond for president and Fielding L. Wright for vice president.

The fight over the civil rights plank at the 1948 convention was a launching point for Humphrey as a political figure of national stature. He was elected to the Senate in November, and in 1964, Vice President of the United States.

==Presidential nomination==
===Presidential candidates===
Balloting for president and vice president took place on July 15. While Southerners who opposed the expansion of civil rights contested Truman for the nomination, he was easily nominated on the first ballot.

=== Balloting ===
In the absence of Southern delegates who walked out of the convention with Thurmond, Truman was nominated on a revised first ballot:

Presidential Balloting / 4th Day of Convention (July 15, 1948)
== Vice presidential nomination ==

Various Democratic Party leaders had promoted candidates for the vice presidential nomination, including Alben W. Barkley and Wilson W. Wyatt of Kentucky, William Preston Lane Jr. and Millard Tydings of Maryland, Oscar R. Ewing of Iowa, James Roosevelt of California, and Joseph C. O&#x27;Mahoney of Wyoming. A group of women delegates also made an unsuccessful effort to put forward former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt as a candidate.

In addition, Truman tried to interest William O. Douglas in the nomination, but Douglas declined. During the convention, Barkley&#x27;s keynote speech won over the delegates, and when it became clear Barkley had more than enough support to win the nomination, Truman agreed to accept him as his running mate.

Barkley was nominated by acclamation.

==Truman&#x27;s acceptance==
Truman was scheduled to give his acceptance speech at 10 pm on July 14, but the convention was behind schedule, so he spoke in the early morning hours of July 15. In his opening, Truman told the delegates &quot;Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make these Republicans like it — don&#x27;t you forget that!&quot; His pugnacious attack on what he termed the &quot;Do-Nothing 80th Congress&quot;, further energized the delegates who had not taken part in the Dixiecrat walkout. Truman&#x27;s speech was looked on in retrospect as the start of the &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry!&quot; campaign theme that enabled Truman to win the November general election.

<doc id="861413" wikidata="Q6978034" url="?curid=861413" title="National Republican Congressional Committee">
<text>The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is the Republican Hill committee which works to elect Republicans to the United States House of Representatives.

The NRCC was formed in 1866, when the Republican caucuses of the House and Senate formed a &quot;Congressional Committee&quot;. It supports the election of Republicans to the House through direct financial contributions to candidates and Republican Party organizations; technical and research assistance to Republican candidates and Party organizations; voter registration, education and turnout programs; and other Party-building activities. It is a registered 527 group.

==NRCC leadership==
The NRCC is always chaired by a Republican member of the House, who may serve up to two consecutive terms. It is governed by an executive committee of 11 members, which includes the party&#x27;s Leader in the House &quot;ex officio&quot;, and other members elected by the Republican Conference following a House election.

The chairman is elected by the House Republican Conference after each congressional election. The eight elected leaders of the Republican Conference of the House of Representatives serve as &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the NRCC&#x27;s executive committee.

The day-to-day operations of the NRCC are overseen by the executive director, who manages a staff involved in campaign strategy development, planning and management, research, digital, communications, fundraising, administration, and legal compliance.

In addition to the chairman, several other members of the House of Representatives aid the efforts of the committee by overseeing various areas important to the NRCC.

The NRCC is broken down into several internal divisions:
Executive,
Treasury,
Research,
Political,
Finance,
Communications, and
Digital.

== List of chairs ==
==Programs==

===Young Guns program===
Founded in the 2007–2008 election cycle by Congressmen Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan, the Young Guns program began as an organization of House Republicans dedicated to electing open seat and challenger candidates nationwide.

During the 2008 cycle, through a partnership of Republican volunteers, donors and 59 members of the House of Representatives, five House GOP challengers won against incumbent Democrats. Four of those were Young Guns – Tom Rooney (FL-16), Bill Cassidy (LA-06), Lynn Jenkins (KS-02), and Pete Olson (TX-22).

Under the leadership of Chairman Sessions, the NRCC adopted the Young Guns program as the candidate recruitment and training program for House Republicans. It is designed to assist Republican candidates for the House of Representatives.

This program is open to all Republican candidates – regardless of a primary or convention situation in their districts – with the ultimate goal of ensuring whoever the Republican nominee is, they are able to build the strongest campaign possible. Those enrolled work with NRCC staff to meet rigorous benchmarks designed to improve their campaign structure, fundraising, communications and online strategy.

There are three levels of the Young Guns program – &quot;On the Radar,&quot; &quot;Contender,&quot; and &quot;Young Gun.&quot; In 2010, 92 campaigns were granted &quot;Young Gun&quot; status.

===Patriot Program===
Following the 2008 United States House of Representatives elections, the NRCC revamped its incumbent protection program, renaming it the Patriot Program. Candidates given the &quot;patriot&quot; designation are provided additional funding and organizational assistance for their reelection campaigns.

==Fundraising==
In 2000 and 2002, one-third of the committee&#x27;s $210.8 million raised was in soft money donations. The committee held record-breaking events featuring President George W. Bush.

After the ban of soft money donations, the NRCC&#x27;s fundraising sources and techniques have been criticized. For the 2004 election cycle, its top three donors included two Indian tribal clients of Jack Abramoff. Others include gambling interests (also related to Abramoff).

On September 21, 2006, Chairman Tom Reynolds met with lobbyists in Washington, D.C. to warn them to contribute only to Republicans and not to challengers from the Democratic Party because their donations would be tracked and they would lose favors among the Republican members of Congress. Similar activities of the K Street Project occurred when Davis was head of the NRCC; the organization was fined by the Federal Election Commission for transferring funds between PACs for the same candidates in violation of contribution limits.

The NRCC has also offered awards such as &quot;Physician of the Year&quot;, &quot;Businessman of the Year&quot;, &quot;Columnist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Congressional Order of Merit&quot; to very few individuals each year.

In April 2021, it was reported that the NRCC had sent donors prechecked boxes that would automatically sign donors up for repeating donations every month if not unchecked. The NRCC sent this message in tandem: &quot;If you UNCHECK this box, we will have to tell Trump you&#x27;re a DEFECTOR.&quot; The message was removed after &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the tactic.

==Automated phone calls==
In 2006, just days before the November 7 midterm congressional elections, there were numerous reports of a series of automated phone calls (&quot;robocalls&quot;) being authorized by the NRCC, with the apparent intention to confuse and annoy the supporters of Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives. The automated call would typically begin by saying, &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m calling with information about ___&quot; and naming the Democratic candidate. If the recipient hung up, the call would be repeated, often several times, thus leading voters to believe incorrectly that the Democratic campaign was harassing them. The NRCC used the tactic in at least 53 competitive House races.

In New Hampshire, the state attorney general&#x27;s office requested that the NRCC end the robocalls, but many individuals in the state continued to report receiving them. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent the NRCC a cease-and-desist letter. The DCCC letter cited the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation requiring that a prerecorded telephone call must identify the responsible entity at the beginning of the message, and must include the entity&#x27;s telephone number. Because the NRCC&#x27;s calls did not name the NRCC at the beginning and did not provide a contact phone number, the DCCC charged the NRCC with &quot;a pattern of willful noncompliance with FCC requirements&quot;.

==Embezzlement==
On March 13, 2008, the NRCC stated that its former treasurer, Christopher J. Ward, had apparently transferred &quot;several hundred thousand dollars&quot; in NRCC funds to &quot;his personal and business bank accounts&quot;. An estimated $724,000 in losses were embezzled from the NRCC by Ward between 2001 and 2007. Ward has served as treasurer for 83 Republican committees and has done work for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.

On June 6, 2008, the Department of Justice, in filing a civil forfeiture proceeding against Ward&#x27;s house, alleged that Ward &quot;made over $500,000 in unauthorized withdrawals&quot; and that he used the money to make his mortgage payments and for home renovation.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) conducted a probe into disclosure reports submitted by the NRCC during Ward&#x27;s tenure as treasurer. Guy Harrison, the executive director of NRCC, agreed to pay a $10,000 civil fine and signed a conciliation agreement with the FEC on June 10, 2010.

On December 2, 2010, a federal judge sentenced Ward to 37 months in prison for stealing more than $844,000 from the NRCC and other political fundraising committees for which he worked as treasurer.

==Recent elections==
===2008 congressional elections ===
In 2008 the NRCC concentrated on trying to help incumbent Republicans win re-election. Even so, the committee had to make &quot;triage&quot;-type decisions about allocating its funds. In October 2008, it canceled several hundred thousand dollars worth of television advertising time slated for the re-election campaigns of Michele Bachmann, Marilyn Musgrave, and Tom Feeney, having concluded that they could not win. The decision drew criticism from the conservative Family Research Council, which stated, &quot;It appears that the NRCC is abandoning social conservative candidates and the issues for which they stand….&quot; Bachmann was the only one of those three who was re-elected, winning a plurality of 46% of the vote in a three-way race.

===2010 congressional elections===
In 2010, Republican candidates won a historic number of seats in the House of Representatives. Rep. Sessions and the NRCC staff received praise for harnessing voter sentiment and contributing to Republican gains.

The NRCC raised and spent tens of millions of dollars on independent expenditure advertising. Republicans won in 52 of the 66 seats where the NRCC made those expenditures.

The NRCC made some of its biggest gains in New York, where two incumbents won reelection and five seats flipped from being held by Democrats to being held by Republicans. In Pennsylvania, the Committee retained seven incumbents and flipped five seats from being held by Democrats to being held by Republicans. The committee made gains across the midwest, where it won control of both North and South Dakota, and made sizeable gains in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

The Committee targeted numerous veteran Democrats who held important posts in their party&#x27;s leadership. The NRCC worked to help GOP candidates defeat Committee Chairmen John Spratt (Budget), Ike Skelton (Armed Services), and James Oberstar (Transportation and Infrastructure). In each of these cases, Republicans prevailed over the Democrats.

<text>Haven Kimmel (born 1965) is an American author, novelist, and poet.

== Life and career ==
Kimmel was born Susan Elizabeth Jarvis (&quot;Betsy&quot;) in New Castle, Indiana, and was raised in Mooreland, Indiana, the focus of her bestselling memoir, &quot;A Girl Named Zippy: Growing up Small in Mooreland, Indiana&quot; (2001).

The book is written from the perspective of Kimmel as a young girl, and in it she sheds light on the townspeople of Mooreland living there in the 1960s and 1970s during the author&#x27;s childhood. The name of the memoir stems from the nickname her father had for her growing up; however, Kimmel does not publicly share her real given name, which she changed to Haven Skye at age 18 after Kentucky folk singer Haven Hughes. Her second memoir, &quot;She Got Up Off the Couch, and Other Heroic Acts from Mooreland, Indiana,&quot; is more history of her childhood, but it also tells the story of her mother, Delonda, who decided to return to college in her middle-age years to eventually become a teacher. Kimmel states she never had the desire to become a writer when she grew up, but by the time she was 21, she says she had &quot;given her life over to poetry,&quot; which she would go on to write for the next 15 years.

Kimmel earned her undergraduate degree in English and creative writing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana and a graduate degree from North Carolina State University, where she studied with novelist Lee Smith. She also attended seminary at the Earlham School of Religion in Richmond, Indiana. She lives in Durham, North Carolina, has been married three times and has three children (Kat, Obadiah and Augusten- named after American writer Augusten Burroughs).

Kimmel was a poet prior to writing the memoir of her early childhood. &quot;The Solace of Leaving Early&quot; (2002) and &quot;Something Rising (Light and Swift)&quot; (2004) are the first two novels in Kimmel&#x27;s &quot;trilogy of place&quot; about fictional Hopwood County, Indiana. The third book, released in September 2007, is titled &quot;The Used World&quot;. Her other works include a second memoir, &quot;She Got Up Off the Couch&quot; (2005), a poetic children&#x27;s book, &quot;Orville: A Dog Story&quot; (2003), and a retelling of the Book of Revelation in &quot;Killing the Buddha: A Heretic&#x27;s Bible&quot; (2004), edited by Peter Manseau and Jeff Sharlet (). Her most recent published works include a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Kaline Klattermaster&#x27;s Tree House&quot; (2008), and the novel &quot;Iodine&quot; (2008), a psychological tale about a young woman with dark secrets.

<doc id="861417" wikidata="Q5247298" url="?curid=861417" title="Death at an Early Age">
<text>Death at an Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools (reissue ) is a book written by the American schoolteacher Jonathan Kozol and published in Boston by Houghton Mifflin in 1967. It won the U.S. National Book Award in the Science, Philosophy and Religion category.

The book describes Kozol&#x27;s first year of teaching a fourth grade in one of the most overcrowded inner city schools in the Boston public school system. Kozol recounts the deeply entrenched policies of racial segregation and inequality on the part of Boston Public Schools and testifies to a crumbling infrastructure in his Roxbury, Boston, neighborhood. The &quot;classroom&quot; he was assigned turned out not to even be a room at all but a corner of an auditorium where other classes were also held, and one day a large window collapsed as he was teaching his class.

The book also documents the public outcry after his dismissal for teaching the Langston Hughes poem &quot;The Ballad of the Landlord&quot; to his reading class, which portrays the exploitation of black tenants by white landlords. The day after presenting the poem to the class an official from the school district informed him that &quot;no literature which is not in the Course of Study can ever be read by a Boston teacher without permission from someone higher up&quot; and he was fired from his position.

<text>The Grupo Montparnasse was an organization of Chilean artists who had joined the gathering of great artists in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France, in the early part of the 20th century. Founding members, Luis Vargas Rosas and Camilo Mori among others, exhibit in the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1920 in Paris where they meet Juan Gris, Pablo Picasso and other artists experimenting in the new trends of the time like cubism and expressionism. The group&#x27;s first exhibition was organized by Luis Vargas Rosas in Santiago in 1923. Their first exhibition was marked by postimpressionist influences, notably the works of Paul Cézanne. Their &quot;Salón de Junio&quot; in 1925 saw a new generation of young painters join the group. Just as their comrades in Paris had, these creative men and women challenged the norms in Chilean painting, profoundly shaping a new world of art in their country.

<text>Give My Head Peace is a satirical television comedy series on BBC Northern Ireland that pokes fun at political parties, paramilitary groups and the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland. The programme is written by Tim McGarry, Damon Quinn and Michael McDowell, also known as &quot;The Hole in the Wall Gang&quot;, who also perform as the characters. Episodes are recorded in front of a live studio audience at the BBC Blackstaff Studio A in Belfast.

==Background==
The concept originated on BBC Radio Ulster music programme &quot;Across The Line&quot; in the late 1980s, as a five-minute slot. The radio version used many of the characters and plot ideas used in the later TV series.

===Pilot: &quot;Two Ceasefires and a Wedding&quot;===
Its first TV appearance was in a made-for-TV film called &quot;Two Ceasefires and a Wedding&quot;, shown on BBC Northern Ireland (31 August 1995), poking fun at the clichéd &quot;love across the barricades&quot; plot that features in many dramas about Northern Ireland. In this case the lovers were Emer, the daughter of a &quot;prominent&quot; Sinn Féin activist, and Billy, an RUC constable. Their wedding is opposed by their respective families, and ends in farce, although Billy and Emer were happily married.

In the Pilot episode, Ma &amp; Da have a second son, Paul, who suffers anxiety from being wrongly imprisoned for one of Da&#x27;s failed missions in England. He is best man at Billy &amp; Emer&#x27;s wedding. He does not appear in the main series.

===Main series===

A full series was then commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland. Some changes were made to the format prior to the series going ahead – with the character of Cal (Emer&#x27;s brother) changing substantially, and the introduction of other recurring characters such as Big Mervyn and Red Hand Luke. A few years into the series, Nuala McKeever (Emer) left the series to pursue other interests, and a new love interest for Billy was introduced in the form of Emer&#x27;s previously unseen sister, Dympna.

The series continued to run on BBC One NI until 2005, taking a hiatus as the Hole in the Wall Gang began work on a new series called &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot;. &quot;Give My Head Peace&quot; usually screened in a prime-time Friday night slot, opting out from network BBC One. In mid-2004, a selection of episodes were shown across the UK on BBC Two in a late-night slot during weekends.

The 50th episode, entitled &quot;Secondary Colours&quot; aired on 27 December 2002.

===Cancellation===
The final &quot;Give My Head Peace&quot; episode was transmitted on BBC One Northern Ireland on 28 December 2007. This was supposed to be the last ever episode but during the final few seconds, a graphic stating &quot;That&#x27;s All Folks?&quot; appeared, suggesting that the show could return in the future. According to Tim McGarry, the reason for the show&#x27;s cancellation was due to a mis-sent email, received by a BBC executive in charge of the show&#x27;s production. Allegedly, McGarry had hit reply rather than forward to the intended recipient.

===2016 special and soft reset===
&quot;Give My Head Peace&quot; returned for a one-off 40-minute long episode titled &quot;The Farce Awakens&quot; on 28 December 2016 – exactly nine years to the day since it last aired. It was filmed in Northern Ireland in October 2016. Television presenter Christine Lampard made a cameo appearance.

With this special, they overwrite the events of the original final episode. In that episode, Billy kills Uncle Andy and Big Mervyn after learning they had lost Billy&#x27;s house and money in a scam. While Billy is in custody, Cal&#x27;s Protestant girlfriend Siobhan is revealed as an undercover police officer trying to get close to Da. When Siobhan tries to kill Da, Ma suspects them of having an affair. This, combined by the knowledge that Da had prevented Liam Neeson from proposing to their daughter Dympna, drives Ma to kill him. Dympna confesses to the murder to spare Ma from prison. Billy is released after being granted a pardon by Ian Paisley and Martin McGuiness. He learns of what happened to his wife Dympna and devotes himself to trying to clear her name, despite now living with two other women. The special now makes these events non-canon.

===2018 return===
The series returned with an eleventh series which began broadcasting on 19 January 2018. This was followed by a Christmas Special called &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; which aired on Thursday 27 December 2018 on BBC One Northern Ireland. The show returned for a Christmas Special in December 2019, as part of the 12th series consisting of four episodes leading into 2020.

The show returned in December 2020 for a Christmas special, to be followed by three other specials in early 2021. Recording of the 2020 Christmas Special and 2021 episodes had to be conducted under strict health guidance due to the Covid-19 pandemic with production moved from their usual location at BBC Blackstaff Studio in the centre of Belfast to a new studio located elsewhere in Northern Ireland to ensure social distancing could be maintained. No studio audience was present for the filming of the episodes, but a virtual audience watched and reacted to the recordings online. The 2020 Christmas special aired on Sunday 27 December 2020 on BBC One Northern Ireland, and saw the cast give a proper send off to the character &quot;Big Mervyn&quot;, as the actor who played him BJ Hogg died earlier in 2020. Three more episodes were aired from mid January 2021.

Three more series (of 4 episodes each) were televised in January 2022, January 2023 and January 2024. A Christmas special, “Merry Christmas Mr Begbie” was broadcast in December 2024.

===Live===
In recent years, they have performed live shows at a selection of venues across Northern Ireland. The 2004 show was chiefly made up of scripts from the 2004–2005 series. In 2007 a new live show entitled &quot;Dry Your Eyes it&#x27;s Give My Head Peace&quot; was held in Derry&#x27;s Millennium Forum and the Grand Opera House to celebrate ten years of the show. This production showed material from &quot;GMHP&quot; and &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot; and was very well received. The next live show in 2008 followed on from the final television episode, called &quot;Give My Head Peace: Back From The Grave&quot;, and also featured the &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot; characters. In 2009, the gang went on their last tour called &quot;Give My Head Peace: The Final Farewell Tour&quot;. However, the show returned on an annual basis with &quot;Give My Head Peace: The Annual Review&quot; touring Northern Ireland. The performance features the show&#x27;s regulars, with the notable exceptions of Mervyn and Red Hand Luke, and also features a stand-up set from Tim McGarry who plays Da.

Since the show was renewed in 2018, the group have also revived their live shows, with events in the Grand Opera House Belfast, the Riverside Theatre, Coleraine and other venues throughout NI.

In 1999 a Give My Head Peace book was released. The only DVD released to date is of series 6, in November 2009.

==Characters==
The principal characters are:

*Da (Tim McGarry) – Da is an Irish Catholic who represents a stereotypical Irish nationalist. He is an ardent fan of Irish culture despite having little knowledge of Irish history and being unable to speak a word of Irish. Da is a Sinn Féin spokesman who later becomes an assemblyman, and recently a &quot;retired assemblyman&quot;. He is very proud of his involvement and (exaggerated) friendship with Gerry Adams. He is fired repeatedly for embarrassing Gerry or the party publicly. He often gets reinstated after blackmailing Gerry with incriminating evidence, which inevitably gets destroyed through ineptitude. He has a beard and wears glasses to replicate Gerry&#x27;s appearance, save for three episodes where they had fallen out. Da claims to have been involved with every unlawful activity that Gerry was allegedly involved with. In the original run, he claims he was directly involved with the IRA alongside Gerry, but has since admitted that he wasn&#x27;t as involved as Gerry was. Da lives in Divis Tower on the Falls Road. He has six adult children with Ma, but only four have ever been seen. It was recently discovered that he was not legally married to Ma, but he is tricked into marrying her again by Cal.
*Cal (Damon Quinn) – Although he is a grown man, he still lives at home and often acts child-like. He supports his father in his self-proclaimed struggle against British imperialism, and usually does what Da tells him, no matter how daft. In the pilot &quot;Two Ceasefires and a Wedding&quot;, he is portrayed as a more sinister IRA activist. In the main series, he is much more gentle and slightly dim-witted. He often proves to be naturally talented at most things he tries, but his attempts at being successful are usually scuppered quite quickly. He is jealous of his seldom seen brother Michael. It is stated by Ma on multiple occasions that Cal came &quot;really close&quot; to getting married until Da ruined, but the details keep changing. In later episodes, he becomes increasingly suspicious that Da is siding with the British, and stands up to him when he is mean to Ma.
*Uncle Andy (Martin Reid) – Uncle Andy is an old-fashioned traditional loyalist whose twin loves are British Ulster and Elvis Presley. He is very argumentative, and determined to take offense at even the slightest suggestion that someone is trying to oppress him. He blames all problems on Catholics and Sinn Fein, and is often abusive towards Dympna for simply being a Catholic and a woman. He often devises elaborate money-making schemes and scams with his best friend Big Mervyn. Their combined lack of intelligence and foresight often cause these plans to fail. In similar respect, he is repeatedly barred from the Loyalist Kneebreakers Social Club or the Orange Order due to his tricks or inappropriate conduct. He used to try to avoid eviction by claiming he was really Billy&#x27;s father until he himself lost track over whether or not it was a scam. It was eventually confirmed that he isn&#x27;t. He is &quot;close friends&quot; with Red Hand Luke and Pastor Begbie despite clearly living in fear of them. In most recent episodes, he becomes convinced that Grainne is his daughter from a one night stand with her mother, mainly because Billy said it was confirmed by a DNA test. The truth has yet to be verified.
*Billy (Michael McDowell) – Uncle Andy&#x27;s nephew and a police officer with the PSNI (formerly RUC). He immediately married Emer after first meeting her in the pilot episode. By the beginning of the first series, it had become a loveless marriage. After Emer leaves with their son, Billy instantly falls in love with Dympna who moves in with him. They are married by the Pope after his divorce is finalised. Billy was raised by Uncle Andy after being abandoned by both parents. There are recurring hints that Uncle Andy is his father until it is eventually verified as untrue. He often assumes &quot;politics&quot; (i.e. he isn&#x27;t a Catholic) is keeping him from promotions, when in fact he is quite lazy. He eventually gets his promotion for helping investigate the hit-and-run incident that injured Da, even though he committed it. While he openly objects to the criminal acts of Uncle Andy and his associates, Billy isn&#x27;t above abusing his policing powers for his own advantage.
*Emer (Nuala McKeever) – Emer is Da and Ma&#x27;s daughter, and marries Billy in the pilot episode. Like Ma, she is uninterested in politics and mean towards Da. However, she is quite intelligent and well informed. She is more interested in fashion and men. So much so that she shamelessly pursues other men despite Billy&#x27;s protests. It is often said that she has a son with Billy who is never seen. By the beginning of series 2, she has left Billy for a Spaniard, and taken their son with them. They are seldom mentioned again until it is discovered that she remarried, thus making it easier for Billy to have his divorce. He shares a birthday with Cal.
*Ma (Olivia Nash) – Da&#x27;s cynical and sharp-tongued wife. She tries to be a typical warm-hearted Irish mother, but she quickly gets frustrated with her family. She openly resents Da, who makes fun of her short stature, and she refers to as a &quot;lanky streak of piss&quot;. While she keeps wishing ill of her husband, she is hurt any time he takes interest in other women. She is uninterested in politics and finds sectarianism to be dumb. This allows her to be accepting of things and people that Da and Cal are less open to, particularly her protestant in-laws. She has the occasional mild crush on Uncle Andy. Multiple episodes revealed that she has obsessions with various celebrities, but the identity of that person keeps changing (e.g. they have included Daniel O&#x27;Donnell and Hugo Duncan). She recently learned that she wasn&#x27;t legally married to Da, but they did marry after Cal tricked Da into it. She also revealed that she is actually a British citizen by birth, and has only ever had British identification documents, which aggravates Da no end.
*Dympna (Alexandra Ford) – Dympna is one of Ma and Da&#x27;s daughters, and Emer&#x27;s younger sister. She replaced Emer as Billy&#x27;s partner after Emer suddenly leaves. She is just as intelligent as her sister, but becomes increasingly ignorant of politics after becoming a Sinn Fein assemblyperson. An important difference is that Dympna is faithful to Billy, and rejects advances from other men. She is bullied by Uncle Andy for being a Catholic and a woman, but she can also dish it back. Dympna marries Billy in a service conducted by The Pope. It is hinted that she is the biological daughter of Italian Cardinal Vincenzo, but this is never resolved. She has a recurring ambition to become famous despite having no talents.
*Big Mervyn (BJ Hogg) – A burly, leather-wearing loyalist, and Uncle Andy&#x27;s best mate. Not the brightest, but generally well-liked. He often assists Uncle Andy in his schemes with little objection. He is often used to send bad news to Andy, like when he has been banned from the Loyalist Kneebreakers Social Club, or is in trouble with someone else. It is frequently shown that Mervyn has many talents and is quite popular, but his association with Andy prevents him from prospering. He is frequently asked to recall events from Andy&#x27;s life on his behalf. Andy sometimes explains that Mervyn chose to remain single due to having never gotten over a past love that went sour. The woman and the events in question change each time this story is told. Hogg was always listed as &quot;guest starring&quot; despite appearing in every episode filmed before his death. In the 2020 series, it was acknowledged that Mervyn had died.
*Pastor Begbie (Paddy Jenkins) – Paster Begbie appeared as recurring character late into the original run, but has since become a main character. He is a Presbyterian Minister and leader of the local chapter of the UDA. He is also involved with organised crime and makes no secret of it. Begbie has been friends with Andy and Mervyn since school. He uses the fact that they fear him to make them do illegal and humiliating things for his own benefit. In each series of the new run, there have been multiple revelations made about him. They include that he joined the IRA and the Priesthood (both while drunk), has an indentical twin who is a priest in Poland, and that he skipped a generational curse because he is not actually related to his father.
*Grainne (Diona Doherty) – Grainne McCallion, a recent addition, is Dympna&#x27;s assistant. She is rude and immature, and dismisses everyone around her as being boring or stupid. She is ignorant of Northern Irish history and politics even though she works for Sinn Fein with her mother Elisha McCallion. She enrolled as a student at Queen&#x27;s despite being on furlough from her present job. Uncle Andy is convinced that she is his daughter from a one night stand, but she is unaware of this. She is initially terrified by Uncle Andy&#x27;s attempts to bond with her, but they develop a reluctant friendship. Even though she acts dumb, she often demonstrates that she is highly intelligent and well-connected. Even though all of her classes have been online (due to government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic), she has become a major influencer among Catholic students. Being from Derry, she is the only main character not to be from the greater Belfast area. She did not appear and was not mentioned in the 2023 series for unknown reasons.
*Sandy (Ciaran Nolan) – Sandy is the current landlord at the Loyalist Kneebreakers Social Club. While he has been mentioned repeatedly during the original run, he made his first onscreen appearances in the 2020 series (after the passing of Hogg). He has a speech impediment that causes him to pronounce the &quot;s&quot; sound as &quot;sh&quot;. For this reason, he pronounces his own name as &quot;Shandy&quot;. While he respects Begbie, he is one of two characters who does not fear him. He repeatedly barred Andy due to his various scams but secretly cares deeply about him. He is shown to be the most intuitive character and uses this to his advantage. In the 2022 series, he has a brief affair with Dymphna to help her become pregnant when she learns Billy had a vascetomy.

Other occasional characters are:

*Red Hand Luke (Dan Gordon) – A born-again Christian and violent loyalist psychopath. He had been friends with Andy since school even though Andy fears him. In the first series, Andy is convinced Luke wants to kill him for not helping him escape the police. Instead, he believes prison changed his life for the better and thanks Andy. From the second series onwards, he is shown to be child-like in spite of his violent tendencies. He tends to beat people up (usually Andy and Mervyn) when he doesn&#x27;t get his way. They live in fear of when he will suddenly (literally) burst through their front door. Although he does sometimes have brief moments of clarity where he realises his circumstances are because of his own behaviour. He is a huge &quot;Shugo&quot; Duncan fan and is unafraid of Begbie, his best friend. At the end of the original run, he longs to go back to prison and converts to Islam in order to get arrested. Andy and Mervyn attempt to break him out of the specially constructed prison in the middle of Belfast Lough. He falls into the Lough, protesting that he cannot swim. His fate is left ambiguous, but he is never mentioned again. 
*Sammy (Gordon Fulton) – The first landlord of the &quot;Loyalist Kneebreakers&quot;, Uncle Andy and Big Mervyn&#x27;s favourite haunt, a rowdy loyalist drinking den. Makes matchstick models of Stormont in his spare time.
*Seamus (Mark O&#x27;Shea) – Seamus works directly for Gerry Adams in Sinn Fein in constantly changing roles. He doesn&#x27;t allow Da or Cal to tell anyone he is also in the IRA. Seamus invites himself into Da&#x27;s flat with instructions from Gerry to help either organisation, hinting at serious repercussions for their (inevitable) failures. Da tries to earn Seamus&#x27; trust by proving his loyalty and is fully aware Seamus is involved with organised crime.
*Sean Paul II (Gerard Jordan) – Sean Paul is a young man who will steal anything. Ma points out his nickname is &quot;Sean Paul the Second&quot; because he steals your possessions &quot;the second your back is turned&quot;. Ma is horrified that Da keeps hiring him or buying stolen goods from him. Da justifies this by pretending he is supporting an &quot;enterprising young man&quot; when in reality he likes cheap products or labour.
*Paul – Paul is one of Da and Ma&#x27;s six children. He is sent to prison during the pilot episode. The parents often update Cal on Paul&#x27;s present situation. Either Da praises Paul&#x27;s &quot;sacrifice&quot; while he is in prison, or Ma praises Paul for starting a new life as a wealthy family man in Los Angeles. Cal is strongly jealous of Paul, especially when he randomly returns from L.A. Cal discovers that Paul was thrown out by his wife due to his refusal to find a job, and takes great joy in exposing the secret. However, as he comes clean, he receives a message from his wife that Paul has successfully sold a script that will be turned into a major Hollywood movie, which he has also been hired to direct, and that she is willing to take him back.

There have been other characters that have made one-off special appearances over the series to an effect. One such example was a Christmas special entitled &quot;The King and I&quot; where Elvis Presley (played by impersonator Martin Fox) saved Andy from a very dangerous situation.

<doc id="861420" wikidata="Q258427" url="?curid=861420" title="Anonymous 4">
<text>Anonymous 4 was an American female &quot;a cappella&quot; quartet, founded in 1986 and based in New York City. Their main performance genre was medieval music, although later they also premiered works by recent composers such as John Tavener and Steve Reich.

The name of the group is a pun on the name used to refer to an anonymous English music theorist of the late 13th century, Anonymous IV, who is the principal source on the two famous composers of the Notre Dame school, Léonin and Pérotin.

Anonymous 4 performed in cities throughout North America, and were regulars at major international festivals. The 2003–2004 season was their last as a full-time recording and touring ensemble, but they continued to tour and make recordings while pursuing individual projects. 

The group collaborated with the Chilingirian Quartet on their 2003 album &quot;Darkness Into Light&quot; and The Mountain Goats on their 2012 album &quot;Transcendental Youth&quot; as well as with Christopher Tin in 2009 on his album &quot;Calling All Dawns&quot;, and in 2014 on &quot;The Drop That Contained the Sea&quot;.

The CD &quot;1865&quot;, which features songs from the Civil War with Bruce Molsky on guitar, fiddle, banjo, and vocals was their final recording. The ensemble disbanded at the end of the 2015–2016 season.

==Lineup==
The original lineup included Johanna Maria Rose, Marsha Genensky, Susan Hellauer, and Ruth Cunningham. In 1998, Cunningham left and was replaced by Jacqueline Horner-Kwiatek. In 2008, Cunningham returned to the group in place of Johanna Maria Rose until their 2016 disbanding. Genensky grew up in California in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains; Hellauer was born and raised in the Bronx, New York; Cunningham was brought up in Millbrook, New York; Rose grew up in the village of Grand View-on-Hudson, New York; and Horner-Kwiatek is from Monkstown, County Antrim, in Northern Ireland (she won her Green Card in the Diversity Immigrant Visa program, commonly known as the &quot;Green Card Lottery&quot;).

<text>Yakov Permyakov (; died 1712) was a Russian seafarer, explorer, merchant, and Cossack.

In 1710, while sailing from the Lena River to the Kolyma River, Permyakov observed the silhouette of two unknown island groups in the sea. Those islands would later be named Bolshoy Lyakhovsky and the Medvyezhi Islands. 

In 1712, Permyakov and his companion Merkury Vagin crossed Yana Bay from the mouth of the Yana River to Bolshoy Lyakhovsky over the ice and explored the then-unknown island. 
Permyakov and Vagin were murdered on the way back from their exploration by mutineering expedition members. The Cossacks took Permyakov&#x27;s deceased body down to the ice and set it on fire. No one knows what the rebellious Cossacks did with the ashes, but Yakov Permyakov&#x27;s remains were never found.

<text>Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP) is a standard system architecture for PowerPC-based computer systems published jointly by IBM and Apple in 1995. Like its predecessor PReP, it was conceptualized as a design to allow various operating systems to run on an industry standard hardware platform, and specified the use of Open Firmware and RTAS for machine abstraction purposes. Unlike PReP, CHRP incorporated elements of the Power Macintosh architecture and was intended to support the classic Mac OS and NetWare, in addition to the four operating systems that had been ported to PReP at the time (Windows NT, OS/2, Solaris, and AIX).

CHRP did not receive industry-wide adoption, however. The only systems to ship with actual CHRP hardware are certain members of IBM&#x27;s RS/6000 series running AIX, and small amount of Motorola PowerStack workstations. Mac OS 8 contains support for CHRP and New World Power Macintosh computers are partially based on CHRP and PReP.

Power.org has a new Power Architecture Platform Reference (PAPR) that provides the foundation for development of Power ISA-based computers running the Linux operating system. The PAPR was released fourth quarter of 2006.

<text>The Ostseestadion is the home stadium of FC Hansa Rostock, a German association football club, located in the city of Rostock. It has a capacity of 29,000.

&quot;Ostseestadion&quot; translates in English to &quot;Baltic Sea Stadium&quot;, and is named after the Baltic Sea, whose coast Rostock lies upon. Ostseestadion is the original name of the stadium, but on 2 July 2007, Hansa Rostock sold the naming rights for the following 10 years to Deutsche Kreditbank (DKB), hence the new official name became &quot;DKB Arena&quot;. In 2015, the club announced that the stadium was to regain its original name, and that the DKB had allowed an early renaming of the stadium and agreed to end the naming contract in advance.

==Location==

The Ostseestadion is located in the German city of Rostock in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Within Rostock, it is situated not far from the city centre in the &quot;Hansaviertel&quot; part of town near several hospitals of the University of Rostock and a small forest called &quot;Barnstorfer Wald&quot;&#x27;. Moreover, an ice hockey stadium as well as several training pitches of Hansa Rostock are just adjacent to the Ostseestadion.

The stadium can be reached easily from all parts of Rostock by public transport, using buses (stop &quot;Ostseestadion&quot;) or the S-Bahn (stop &quot;Holbeinplatz&quot;). Public transport is free with a valid ticket for a home match three hours before and two hours after the actual match.

==History==
The stadium was newly built in 2001 on the site of a former stadium built in 1954. At the end of the 1960s a new 700 lux lighting system was added, which is still in use today.

==Seating==

The total capacity of 29,000 places includes 1000 &quot;business seats&quot; as well as a standing capacity of 9,000. During international matches the 9,000 standing places can be turned into 5,000 seats thus allowing for an audience of 25,000. Moreover, there are 26 business lounges for premium partners and sponsors.

<text>The Old English Sheepdog is a large breed of dog that emerged in England from early types of herding dog. Other names for the breed include Shepherd&#x27;s Dog and . The nickname &quot;Bob-tail&quot; (or &quot;Bobtail&quot;) originates from how dogs of the breed traditionally had their tails docked. Old English Sheepdogs can grow very long coats with fur covering the face and eyes and do not shed unless brushed.

==Appearance==
The Old English Sheepdog is a large dog, immediately recognizable by its long, thick, shaggy grey and white coat, with fur covering their face and eyes. The ears lie flat to the head. Historically, the breed&#x27;s tail was commonly docked (resulting in a panda bear–like rear end), but tailed Old English sheepdogs are now common, as many countries have outlawed cosmetic docking. When the dog has a tail, it has long fur (feathering), is low set, and normally hangs down. The Old English Sheepdog stands lower at the shoulder than at the loin, and walks with a &quot;bear-like roll from the rear&quot;.

Height at the withers is at least 61 cm (24 in), with females slightly smaller than males. The body is short and compact with a deep chest and &#x27;well-sprung&#x27; ribs.

Colour of the double coat may be any shade of grey, grizzle, black, blue, or blue merle, with optional white markings. The undercoat is water resistant. Puppies are born with a black and white coat, and it is only after the puppy coat has been shed that the more common grey or silver shaggy hair appears. Old English Sheepdogs only shed when they are brushed.

==Docking==
Undocked Old English Sheepdogs are becoming a more common sight as many countries have now banned docking. The Kennel Club (UK) and The Australian National Kennel Council breed standards do not express a preference for (legally) docked or un-docked animals, and either can be shown. The American Kennel Club breed standard states that the tail should be &quot;docked close to the body, when not naturally &quot;, even though the practice of cosmetic docking is now opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association.

==History==
The Old English Sheepdog comes from the pastoral type dogs of England. A small drop-eared dog seen in a 1771 painting by Gainsborough is believed by some to represent the early type of the Old English Sheepdog. In the early 19th century a bobtailed drovers dog, called the Smithfield or Cotswold Cor, was noticed in the southwestern counties of England and may have been an ancestor. Most fanciers agree that the Bearded Collie was among the original stock used in developing today&#x27;s breed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark/Brace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculate that the Russian Owtchar was among the breed&#x27;s ancestors.

The Old English Sheepdog was at first called the &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Dog&quot; and was exhibited for the first time at a show in Birmingham, England, in 1873. There were only three entries, and the judge felt the quality of the dogs was so poor that he offered only a second placing. From that beginning, the breed became a popular show dog, and, although the shape of the dog itself has changed very little over the years, elaborate grooming including backcombing and powdering the fur was recorded as early as 1907. The breed was exported to the United States in the 1880s, and by the turn of the 20th century, five of the ten wealthiest American families bred and showed the Old English Sheepdog. The breed continues to be a popular show dog today.

The best recent finish of an Old English Sheepdog at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show was in 2013 when Bugaboo&#x27;s Picture Perfect was awarded Reserve Best in Show.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. The Old English Sheepdog is predisposed to allergic skin disease and demodicosis.

An American study reviewing over a million patients presented to 27 veterinary teaching hospitals in North America found the Old English Sheepdog to be predisposed to hip dysplasia, with 11.1% of dogs examined having the condition compared to 3.52% overall. Another American study of over a million hip evaluations in dogs over the age of 2 years found a prevalence of 17.8%.

A review of 1,934 cases of dogs presenting for gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV) found the Old English Sheepdog to be predisposed, with an odds ratio of 4.8. A UK survey attributed 7% of Old English Sheepdog deaths to GDV.

A review of 369 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy in England found the Old English Sheepdog to make up 9 of those cases.

The Old English Sheepdog is one of the more commonly affected breeds for an autosomal recessive mutation in the MDR1 gene. This mutation results in the affected animal being more susceptible to negative effects of drugs at volumes that are otherwise safe. Common drugs such as doramectin and ivermectin will cause neurotoxicosis.

==Activities==
The Old English Sheepdog can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Old English Sheepdogs that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

==Dulux dog==

The Old English Sheepdog is the brand mascot for Dulux paint. The dog was first introduced in advertising campaigns in 1961. Since then they have been a constant and highly popular feature of Dulux television and print adverts wherever the paint is sold. So much so, that many people in those markets refer to the breed as a &#x27;Dulux dog&#x27; rather than a Sheepdog.

Over the years, different dogs have appeared in the adverts. However, they all look very similar, due to the carefully managed selection process carried out by ICI&#x27;s advertising agency. The first Dulux dog was &quot;Shepton Daphnis Horsa&quot;, pet name Dash, who held the role for eight years, owned by Eva Sharp in Tottenham. His successor, &quot;Fernville Lord Digby&quot;, was the most famous Dulux dog and also made his owners, Cynthia and Norman Harrison, famous.

When filming advertisements, Digby was treated like a star, being driven to the studio in a chauffeur driven car. Barbara Woodhouse was employed to train Digby and his three stunt doubles, who were used whenever specific tricks or actions needed to be filmed. Digby&#x27;s popularity led him to play the title role in the 1973 British comedy film &quot;Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World&quot;.

Gambit - another Dulux dog, was used in a photographic shoot in 1980 for Philips Video and its new generation of video recorders. By the time the shoot was finished, there was enough hair to fill a mattress - the dog was constantly groomed during the shoot. King Hotspur of Amblegait was used from 1974 to 1979 and appeared in over fifty television programmes as well as his public appearances for ICI/Dulux.

Apart from Dash, all the Dulux dogs have been breed champions, and five of them have won &#x27;Best in Show&#x27; prizes.

The Dulux dog was placed at No. 51 in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Television Adverts&quot;.

<text>PowerPC Reference Platform (PReP) was a standard system architecture for PowerPC-based computer systems (as well as a reference implementation) developed at the same time as the PowerPC processor architecture. Published by IBM in 1994, it allowed hardware vendors to build a machine that could run various operating systems, including Windows NT, OS/2, Solaris, Taligent and AIX.

One of the stated goals of the PReP specification was to leverage standard PC hardware. Apple, wishing to seamlessly transition its Macintosh computers to PowerPC, found this to be particularly problematic. As it appeared no one was particularly happy with PReP, a new standard, the Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP), was developed and published in late 1995, incorporating the elements of both PReP and the Power Macintosh architecture. Key to CHRP was the requirement for Open Firmware (also required in PReP-compliant systems delivered after June 1, 1995), which gave vendors greatly improved support during the boot process, allowing the hardware to be far more varied.

PReP systems were never popular. Finding current, readily available operating systems for old PReP hardware can be difficult. Debian and NetBSD still maintain their respective ports to this architecture, although developer and user activity is extremely low. The RTEMS real-time operating system provides a board support package for PReP which can be run utilizing the QEMU PReP emulator. This provides a convenient development environment for PowerPC-based real-time, embedded systems.

Power.org has a Power Architecture Platform Reference (PAPR) that provides the foundation for development of Power ISA-based computers running the Linux operating system. PAPR was released in the fourth quarter of 2006.

<doc id="861445" wikidata="Q3399554" url="?curid=861445" title="Portsmouth Sinfonia">
<text>The Portsmouth Sinfonia was an English orchestra founded by a group of students at the Portsmouth School of Art in 1970. The Sinfonia was generally open to anyone and ended up drawing players who were either people without musical training or, if they were musicians, ones that chose to play an instrument that was entirely new to them. Among the founding members was one of their teachers, English composer Gavin Bryars. The orchestra started as a one-off, tongue-in-cheek performance art ensemble but became a cultural phenomenon over the following 10 years, with concerts, record albums, a film and a hit single. They last performed publicly in 1979.

==History==
Bryars was interested more in experimenting with the nature of music than forming a traditional orchestra. Instead of picking the most competent musicians he could find, he encouraged anyone to join, regardless of talent, ability or experience. The only rules were that everyone had to come for rehearsals and that people should try their best to get it right and not intentionally try to play badly. The first recording made by the Sinfonia was a flexi disc of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell Overture&quot;, which was sent out as the invitation for the degree show that year.

The early repertoire of the Sinfonia was drawn from standard classical repertoire (such as &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; waltz and &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;), so that most orchestra members had a rough idea of what the piece should sound like, even if they could not play their chosen instrument accurately. In later years, the group&#x27;s repertoire would expand to popular music, including rock and roll. Many modern composers and musicians found this to be interesting and even profound; the comedic aspects of the music were merely a bonus, though it was used extensively for marketing purposes. Brian Eno was interested enough to join the orchestra, playing clarinet, and subsequently producing their first two albums.

The orchestra was invited by the composer Michael Parsons to play the Purcell Room at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall. Their first album, &quot;Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics&quot;, was released in 1974. On 28 May 1974, as their fame increased, they played a concert at the Royal Albert Hall with conductor John Farley which sold thousands of tickets. The orchestra&#x27;s take on the late 1970s and early 1980s vogue for pop classical medleys, &quot;Classical Muddly&quot; – produced by their manager Martin Lewis and released by Springtime!/Island Records in 1981 – is characteristic of their sound; it was inspired by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Hooked on Classics&quot;. The single, which consisted of the group&#x27;s previous recordings sped up, amalgamated and synchronized to a disco beat, was a top 40 hit in the UK Singles Chart. 

As the years passed, the musicians eventually became accustomed to, and more skilled at playing their instruments, which diminished the novelty of the group. Although the group never formally disbanded, it ceased performing in 1979.

A recording of the sinfonia playing the beginning of &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; has achieved some fame as an internet meme under the moniker &quot;orchestra fail&quot;, further gaining popularity on YouTube via references from musician Devin Townsend. The recording was used as the walk-on music for Swedish band Peter Bjorn and John during their 2011 &quot;Gimme Some&quot; tour in the US.

The Portsmouth Sinfonia was the subject of a 2011 BBC Radio 4 documentary presented by Jolyon Jenkins in the series &quot;In Living Memory&quot;. In the programme Gavin Bryars disputed the notion that members were required to be novices at their instruments, saying that it was a &quot;scurrilous rumour put about by the BBC&quot;.

Michael Nyman created a similar outfit called Foster&#x27;s Social Orchestra, which is heard on the soundtrack of the 1999 film &quot;Ravenous&quot;.

<text>The scaly-sided merganser or Chinese merganser (Mergus squamatus) is an endangered typical merganser (genus &quot;Mergus&quot;). It lives in Manchuria and extreme Southeast Siberia, breeding in the north and wintering in the south.

==Description==
This striking sea duck has a thin red bill and a scaled dark pattern on the flanks and rump. Both sexes have a crest of wispy elongated feathers, reaching almost to the shoulders in adult males and being fairly short in females and immatures. The adult male has a black head and neck, white breast and underparts, and blackish mantle and wings, except for the white innerwings. The scaling is also black, while the tail is medium grey. The female has a buffish head and otherwise replaces the male&#x27;s black with grey colour. The legs are orange-red and the irides dark brown in both sexes.

==Ecology==
Their breeding habitat is rivers in primary forest in the southeastern Russian Far East, perhaps in North Korea, and in two locations Changbai Mountains and small isolated location in Lesser Xingan Mtns. in northeastern China. The bulk of the species&#x27; population breed in Russian Far East (85%) and Changbaishan both in China and DPRK &quot;M. squamatus&quot; are migratory, wintering in central and southern China, with small numbers in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, northern Vietnam, Myanmar and Thailand. They arrive on the breeding grounds as soon as winter is over, in March, and leave when the first cold nights come in mid November.

This shy and easily startled bird favors mid-sized rivers which meander through wide expanses of mixed forest in the mountains, up to 1,000 meters ASL or less. Birds tend to move upriver during the day, both when startled and when foraging; the latter is probably because stirred-up sediments will alert and hide prey downstream. Food is caught with the serrated beak from among the riverbed gravel. Often the birds dive for prey, repeatedly submerging for a quarter-to half-minute with only a few seconds pause between dives. In shallow water, the birds submerge only the head; they do not upend. The birds are not very social during breeding period and they gather in small groups in autumn and winter. Even on the wintering grounds, groups of more than a dozen are very rare.

They spend most of the daylight time foraging, except around noon when they take some time to rest, preen and socialize at the river banks, where they also sleep. The food of &quot;M. squamatus&quot; consists of aquatic arthropods, frogs and small to medium-sized fish. Stonefly (Plecoptera) and Phryganeidae giant caddisfly larvae may constitute the bulk of its diet when available. Beetles and crustaceans are eaten less regularly, though the latter may be more important in autumn. As aquatic insect larvae hatch in the course of the summer, fish become more prominent in the diet. Favorite fish species include the dojo loach (&quot;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&quot;) and the lenok &quot;Brachymystax lenok&quot;. More rarely eaten are such species as the lamprey &quot;Eudontomyzon morii&quot;, the sculpin &quot;Mesocottus haitej&quot;, or the Arctic grayling (&quot;Thymallus arcticus&quot;). Thus, they are opportunistic feeders; regarding fish, they will probably eat any species that has the correct elongated shape and small size.

Scaly-sided mergansers nest in trees, as typical for the merganser and goldeneye lineage of sea ducks. Preferred nesting trees are such species as daimyo oak (&quot;Quercus dentata&quot;, ), Chozenia, Linden and Ussuri poplar (&quot;Populus ussuriensis&quot;, 大青杨; a balsam poplar). Easy breed in artificial nest boxes on the rivers with destroyed forests on banks.

They are sympatric with Mandarin ducks (&quot;Aix galericulata&quot;); perhaps competing for nesting holes (which neither can excavate themselves). In its winter quarters, the scaly-sided merganser might compete with other Merginae with which it shares its habitat then, e.g. common mergansers (&quot;M. merganser&quot;) and common goldeneyes (&quot;Bucephala clangula&quot;).

==Status==
This species is considered endangered by the IUCN. Its numbers declined in the 1960s and 1970s due to loss of primary forests in its limited range, particularly along the major rivers in Russia. Current threats include illegal hunting, entanglement in (ghost) fishing nets and river pollution, as well as ongoing destruction of forest. According to its current IUCN classification EN C2a(ii), fewer than 5000 adult and first and second year old birds remain, and most of these are found in Primorye and South Khabarovsk regions of Russia (85%)

World population survey was completed in 2014 both in Russia and China, the number for North Korea was estimated without survey there. Surveys on dispersal wintering grounds are useless and the way to estimate world population is to survey pristine rivers within breeding range. Rivers of Central China, primarily tributaries of Yangtze River, and all rivers of South Korea constitutes the wintering area well known nowadays. Habitat loss in China led to breeding range reduction and fragmentation there. In Russia population seems to stabilize in 1900th and until now.

==Threats and conservation measures==
Winter ecology and conservation threats to the scaly-sided merganser were reported in 2012. Threats include sand mining, fishing, riparian vegetation destruction, habitat fragmentation, and water pollution. Recommended conservation measures include provision of artificial nest boxes, informing local residents of the merganser&#x27;s status, fishing regulation, protection of critical habitat, controlling recreation on breeding rivers and the raising of domestic ducks in areas where the mergansers winter, management of hydrology in ways that protect and benefit the merganser, and annual population surveys at key breeding rivers.

<text>Richard Arthur Beckinsale (6 July 1947 – 19 March 1979) was an English actor. He played Lennie Godber in the BBC sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot; (along with its sequel series &quot;Going Straight&quot;) and Alan Moore in the ITV sitcom &quot;Rising Damp&quot;. He is the father of actresses Samantha and Kate Beckinsale.

==Early life==
Richard Beckinsale was born in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, the youngest of three children, to an Anglo-Burmese father, Arthur John Beckinsale, and an English mother, Maggie Barlow. Richard stated in 1977 that he may have been a distant relative of the actor Charles Laughton.

While attending College House Junior School in Chilwell, Richard appeared in his first of many school plays, playing Dopey in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot; As a teenager at Alderman White Secondary Modern School, he played the lead in &quot;Tobias and the Angel&quot; and also appeared as Hsieh Ping-Kuei in &quot;Lady Precious Stream&quot;, which earned him a positive review in the &quot;Nottingham Evening Post&quot;. Richard left school at 15 with ambitions to become a professional actor but he was still too young to go to drama school. He spent a year working in numerous manual labour jobs, including spells as an upholsterer&#x27;s apprentice, a pipe inspector, and an assistant in a grocery business.

At 16, Richard enrolled at Clarendon College (later part of Nottingham College) taking the drama teacher&#x27;s training programme and spent the next two years there, until he was old enough to apply to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After failing his first audition for RADA, Richard was accepted on his second attempt, becoming just one of 31 successful applicants from a total of more than 12,500. While at RADA, Richard won a prize for comedy.

After graduating in 1968, he moved to Crewe to begin in repertory theatre. He also appeared in various other repertory productions around the country, including Hull, Leeds, London and Colchester. While at Crewe, Richard played such roles as the Scarecrow in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Sir Andrew Aguecheek in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and the title role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Following his stint in 1969 playing Hamlet, Richard took a brief hiatus from acting and worked at a bottle factory, before returning to acting soon after.

==Career==
===First television appearances===
Richard made his television debut in 1969 as a police officer in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, in which he had to arrest veteran character Ena Sharples. He later had a small role in a 1970 episode of &quot;A Family at War&quot;, playing a young soldier.

===&quot;The Lovers&quot;===
After being recommended by several other actors for the part, Richard landed his first starring role as Geoffrey in the sitcom &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1970–71), opposite fellow newcomer Paula Wilcox. The show put both leading performers in the eye of the public and a film version was made in 1973 with both Richard and Wilcox reprising their roles.

===&quot;Porridge&quot;===
From 1974 to 1977, Richard starred as prison inmate Lennie Godber alongside Ronnie Barker in the hit BBC sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;. Richard expressed relief at landing the role, owing to his concern about being typecast as Geoffrey from &quot;The Lovers&quot;. Barker had suggested actor Paul Henry for the role of Godber, owing to Henry&#x27;s being from Birmingham (as Godber was meant to be), but director Sydney Lotterby chose Richard Beckinsale instead. Richard initially played Godber with a Birmingham accent, but this was eventually abandoned. Actor Brian Glover, who played the character Cyril Heslop on &quot;Porridge&quot;, stated that Heslop&#x27;s line &quot;I read a book once; green it was&quot; from the first episode, New Faces, Old Hands, was actually Richard&#x27;s idea.

===&quot;Rising Damp&quot;===
While appearing in &quot;Porridge&quot; on the BBC, Richard simultaneously starred as naive medical student Alan Moore in the ITV sitcom &quot;Rising Damp&quot; also from 1974 to 1977. Richard was the only member of the cast not to have appeared in &quot;The Banana Box&quot;, the play on which &quot;Rising Damp&quot; was based. Writer Eric Chappell stated: &quot;Although not the oldest, he was the most experienced sitcom actor of the quartet, having already appeared in &quot;The Lovers&quot; and &quot;Porridge&quot;. This allowed him to be something of a calming influence on the show – a calming influence that was often needed.&quot; Richard had previously worked with Leonard Rossiter in the 1974 Johnny Speight drama &quot;If There Weren&#x27;t Any Blacks You&#x27;d Have To Invent Them&quot;. Because of a scheduling conflict with the musical &quot;I Love My Wife&quot;, in which he was starring, Richard was unable to appear in the fourth series of &quot;Rising Damp&quot;.

===&quot;Going Straight&quot;===
In 1977, &quot;Porridge&quot; was brought to an end with his character of Godber being released from his prison sentence in the final episode. He subsequently starred alongside Barker in &quot;Going Straight&quot; (1978), a spin-off of &quot;Porridge&quot; in which the two criminal characters are seen on the outside rebuilding their lives. Tentative plans for further episodes of the spin-off were shelved due to Richard&#x27;s death in 1979.

===&quot;Bloomers&quot;===
Richard starred in his final television comedy, &quot;Bloomers&quot;, the five completed episodes of which eventually aired in September and October 1979 on BBC 2. He played Stan, an out-of-work actor who takes a job as a partner at a flower shop. This was the first sitcom of Richard&#x27;s in which he had the leading role.

===Other work===
In between series one and two of &quot;The Lovers&quot; Richard starred in an ITV children&#x27;s show titled &quot;Elephant&#x27;s Eggs in a Rhubarb Tree&quot;. The show featured jokes, poetry, and music.

He had the lead role of a young detective in the 1971 &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; episode &quot;Detective Waiting&quot;.

Richard appeared in the films &quot;Rentadick&quot; (1972) and &quot;Three for All&quot; (1975) and made appearances in several other television series such as the Stephen Frears-directed &quot;ITV Playhouse&quot; episode &quot;Last Summer&quot; in 1977.

Throughout his TV series run, Richard also did a 19-month run in the West End play &quot;Funny Peculiar&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for &quot;Actor of the Year in a New Play&quot; and &quot;Comedy Performance of the Year&quot;. He later did a six-month run in the London debut of the Cy Coleman and Michael Stewart musical &quot;I Love My Wife&quot;.

Shortly after his 30th birthday, Richard was the subject of an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Ronnie Barker and Fulton MacKay of &quot;Porridge&quot;, Leonard Rossiter and Don Warrington of &quot;Rising Damp&quot;, and Paula Wilcox of &quot;The Lovers&quot; all gave tributes during the show.

In 1977, he starred in a radio comedy series called &quot;Albert and Me&quot; with Pat Coombs and John Comer. He also appeared in an advertisement for Asda which aired in 1978 and early 1979. He appeared in the film version of &quot;Porridge&quot; released in 1979. It was to be his last and only completed work of the year.

In October 1980, Frederick Muller Ltd. posthumously published a volume of Richard&#x27;s poetry entitled &quot;With Love&quot; ().

==Personal life==
Richard was married twice. In 1966, he married his pregnant girlfriend, a local Nottingham woman named Margaret Bradley, whom he had met in 1964 while singing at a folk club. Their daughter, actress Samantha Beckinsale, was born on 23 July 1966. When he was accepted into RADA, they moved to London. Richard became immersed in student life and he and his wife grew apart. They separated in 1968 when Margaret took Samantha back to live in Nottingham and Richard left London to work in repertory in Crewe. They divorced in 1971 and he did not see his daughter for years. Margaret later remarried and her new husband raised Samantha as his daughter. Samantha was unaware that her biological father was Richard until she was 11. Richard and Samantha reconnected soon after and spent time together before his death in 1979.

Richard met actress Judy Loe in 1968 at Crewe repertory. They soon began dating and lived together for years. Their daughter, actress Kate Beckinsale, was born on 26 July 1973. They finally married in 1977, prior to Kate starting nursery school.

Richard enjoyed playing the guitar and singing, and he performed in folk clubs in Nottingham as a teenager. He also enjoyed playing football and often played in charity matches with the Entertainers XI team. He was a fan of Manchester United football team.

Richard stated that towards the end of his 19 month run with the play &quot;Funny Peculiar&quot;, he took Valium and had several instances of having to start the play over again due to overwork and mental strain. Richard&#x27;s widow, Loe, stated that he suffered from occasional panic attacks.

Because of his good looks and his being on television so often, he received a large amount of fan mail, particularly from women. Although Richard was pleased with the success of the sitcoms he starred in, he expressed a desire to play more serious roles as he got older.

==Death==
Richard worked on the BBC sitcom &quot;Bloomers&quot;, five episodes of which were filmed prior to Christmas 1978. According to his &quot;Bloomers&quot; co-star Anna Calder-Marshall, during the recording of the first episode, he told her he had suffered some kind of blackout and had some dizzy spells. This concerned him enough to make an appointment to see a doctor, but the doctor could not find anything wrong apart from an overactive stomach lining and slightly high cholesterol. As filming on the series progressed, Richard appeared increasingly tired and &quot;greyer and greyer&quot;, according to co-star David Swift. Because of an industrial dispute at the BBC in late December 1978, the filming of the sixth episode of &quot;Bloomers&quot; had to be postponed until March.

In January 1979, for an insurance policy for a film, Richard passed a full medical examination in which his heart, lungs, breathing, and blood pressure were checked. He spent January and February working on &quot;Porridge&quot; and then prepared to start work on &quot;Bloody Kids&quot; in March.

A week before he died, Richard complained to his wife Judy Loe of feeling unwell and said he was unable to take her to hospital. At the time, they both put it down to nerves; she was due to have an operation to increase the couple&#x27;s chances of having another child. Loe underwent the operation on Wednesday 14 March and while she remained in the hospital recuperating, Richard continued to work on &quot;Bloody Kids&quot; and resumed work on the sixth episode of &quot;Bloomers&quot;, commuting between London by day and Southend-on-Sea by night.

On the evening of Saturday, 17 March, he attended a farewell party for The Two Ronnies, who were about to leave for Australia. According to David Jason, who was at the party, Richard left the party at around 11:30, in order to attend another friend&#x27;s party. Jo Apted, wife of &quot;The Lovers&quot; director Michael Apted, stated that Richard attended a party at her house on Saturday night and felt unwell the next day. On Sunday 18 March, he worked on &quot;Bloomers&quot; and gave Anna Calder-Marshall a lift home afterwards. To her surprise, he began to talk about his fear of dying and of being alone in the house. He then took his five-year-old daughter Kate to visit Loe in hospital. Upon leaving the hospital, Richard dropped his daughter off with relatives to spend the night. Afterwards, he returned to his house in Sunningdale, Berkshire. At some point that day, he called his older daughter Samantha and made plans to spend some time with her the following weekend. Before going to bed, he telephoned a couple of friends, and, during the conversation, he repeated that he had been feeling unwell, and also said that he had some pain in his chest and arms. He seemed in good humour, however, and made a joke out of it.
When he did not arrive at the rehearsal for the sixth and final episode of &quot;Bloomers&quot; the next morning, a member of the production team rang his house, and the phone was answered by family friend Rosana Bradley, who had been staying at the house to help take care of Kate, but had not been there the previous night. She said Richard was still sleeping, and she left the phone to wake him up. When she returned, she said that she was unable to wake him, and was advised to call a doctor. Shortly after, it was confirmed that he had died during the night of what appeared to be a massive heart attack.

The post-mortem examination revealed that he had coronary artery disease, which caused the heart attack. Richard had expressed worries about his cholesterol to friend Stephen Frears over dinner just days earlier, but he seemed healthy and fit and had no cardiac problems in his medical records. According to Frears, Richard&#x27;s high cholesterol may have been a factor in his early death.

Richard&#x27;s death was met with great shock. &quot;Rising Damp&quot; co-star Frances de la Tour stated: &quot;It is such a shock that someone as young and obviously fit as him should die so suddenly. The last time I saw him he had given up smoking, not that he smoked very much, anyway. He was always concerned about keeping fit and we used to tease him about it. He used to play a lot of charity football, but the terrible thing is that he was a family man. I am most distressed for his family.&quot; &quot;The Lovers&quot; creator Jack Rosenthal stated: &quot;He must have had one of the biggest futures any actor could hope for. He was a very honest boy and he had that same quality in his acting.&quot;

Richard was cremated during a private service in Bracknell, Berkshire, and his remains were then taken to Mortlake Crematorium. Although Richard left more than £65,000 () in his will, only approximately £18,000 was left after taxes and other costs. On 19 April 1979, one month after his death, more than 300 people attended a memorial service at the actors&#x27; church St Paul&#x27;s in Covent Garden. Leonard Rossiter, Fulton MacKay, Richard Briers, and &quot;Porridge&quot; writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais gave tributes during the service. La Frenais stated: &quot;I was always amazed by Richard&#x27;s talent. I&#x27;m convinced he would have become an international actor.&quot; Briers said: &quot;The character of Lennie Godber had a kind of innocence which was a danger but also a kind of protection against prison life. Richard had a similar innocence. It made him vulnerable but he was never one for upstaging, scene-stealing and the kind of action which substituted technique for truth. Richard made us laugh and also charmed us. He was an effortless charmer.&quot; Richard&#x27;s widow, Judy, stated: &quot;It was a celebration, not a memorial service.&quot; A memorial plaque was later placed in the church in Beckinsale&#x27;s honour.

==Unfinished work==
At the time of his death, Richard had almost completed the BBC sitcom &quot;Bloomers&quot;. Writer James Saunders&#x27;s original script reveals that Richard was due to attend the sixth and last rehearsal for the final episode of the series on the day he died, with the show to be recorded the following day. The five completed &quot;Bloomers&quot; episodes were aired later in the year.

Plans had been drawn up to make a film version of &quot;Rising Damp&quot; and ultimately the film was made in 1980. Christopher Strauli was recruited to replace Richard, playing a different character.

He was also in the middle of making a television film, &quot;Bloody Kids&quot;, which then had to be re-cast. This role marked a change in direction for Richard, playing a hard-nosed detective character in contrast to the naive characters he had played before. Although Richard does not noticeably appear in the film, director Stephen Frears stated that there are a small number of scenes in which Richard is just off camera, as well as a scene in which he is in a car, although indistinguishable to the viewer. Some of the footage of Richard, which could not be included in the film, was shown during the 2000 ITV tribute, &quot;The Unforgettable Richard Beckinsale&quot;, as well as the 2016 ITV3 documentary, &quot;Rising Damp Forever&quot;. One scene showed Richard questioning a character in the film with a tough stance, and looking quite different than his usual appearance with much shorter cropped hair.

==Legacy and tributes==
Three days after Richard&#x27;s death, &quot;Going Straight&quot; won a BAFTA award. A clearly shaken and upset Ronnie Barker delivered a brief acceptance speech in tribute to his co-star. Richard holds the distinction of having starred in three different sitcoms, each of which won the BAFTA for Best Situation Comedy, in three successive years: &quot;Porridge&quot; in 1977, &quot;Rising Damp&quot; in 1978, and &quot;Going Straight&quot; in 1979.

When Richard&#x27;s book of poetry, &quot;With Love&quot; was published in 1980, Judy Loe, Ronnie Barker, and Richard Briers appeared on &quot;The Russell Harty Show&quot; to talk about the book and recite some of the poetry.

In 2000, 21 years after his death, a documentary was broadcast on ITV in tribute, called &quot;The Unforgettable Richard Beckinsale&quot;. It featured interviews with his widow, the actress Judy Loe, as well as his father, sister, closest school friend and two daughters. Also contributing were his co-stars, Ronnie Barker of &quot;Porridge&quot; and Don Warrington of &quot;Rising Damp&quot;. Barker, remembering Richard&#x27;s premature death, said: &quot;He was so loved. He hadn&#x27;t done much but he was so loved that there was a universal sort of grief that went on.&quot;

In the 2006 film &quot;Venus&quot;, during a scene inside the actors&#x27; church, St Paul&#x27;s, Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s character, an aging actor, points out Richard&#x27;s plaque, as an example of an actor who died in his prime.

In 2007, Alan Davies nominated Richard as his chosen subject for the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Great Lives&quot;. Judy Loe and Stephen Frears participated in the discussion of Beckinsale&#x27;s life and career.

A biography of Richard, titled &quot;The Richard Beckinsale Story&quot; was published in 2008 by author David Clayton. It featured interviews with family, friends, and co-workers of Richard&#x27;s.

In 2013, a blue plaque in Richard&#x27;s memory was unveiled at his former school, College House Junior School in Chilwell. Kate Beckinsale, Judy Loe, David Walliams, and Michael Sheen attended the ceremony.

UK Gold aired a three-part documentary in 2014 called &quot;Porridge: Inside Out&quot;, in celebration of &quot;Porridge&quot;&#x27;s 40th anniversary. During this series, there was a memorial segment dedicated to Richard, in which Judy Loe and Kate Beckinsale took part.

ITV3 aired a two-part documentary in 2016 called &quot;Rising Damp Forever&quot; which looked back at the making of &quot;Rising Damp&quot;. There was a memorial segment for Richard during the series in which his daughters, Samantha and Kate took part.

In 2018, as part of an art project in Richard&#x27;s former hometown of Beeston, a mural of him was commissioned by the town council and painted by the French street artist, Zabou.

&quot;Rising Damp&quot; co-star Frances de la Tour said of Richard&#x27;s acting ability: &quot;Richard was a brilliant young actor as so many have testified. His comedy was based on the truth. That is what people mean by &#x27;timing.&#x27; So we believed him at all times. There is no greater testament. Ronnie Barker was similar, which is why they worked so well and movingly together.&quot;

<text>New World ROM computers are Macintosh models that do not use a Macintosh Toolbox ROM on the logic board. Due to Mac OS X not requiring the availability of the Toolbox, this allowed ROM sizes to shrink dramatically (typically from to ), and facilitated the use of flash memory for system firmware instead of the now more expensive and less flexible Mask ROM that most previous Macs used. A facility for loading the Toolbox from the startup device was, however, made available, allowing the use of Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 on New World machines.

The New World architecture was developed for the Macintosh Network Computer, an unrealized project that eventually contributed several key technologies to the first-generation iMac.

All PowerPC Macs from the iMac, the iBook, the Blue and White Power Mac G3 and the Bronze Keyboard (Lombard) PowerBook G3 forward are New World ROM machines, while all previous models (including the Beige Power Mac G3 and all other beige and platinum Macs) are Old World ROM machines. Intel based Macs are incapable of running Mac OS 9 (or, indeed, any version of Mac OS X prior to Tiger), and on these machines EFI is used instead of Open Firmware, which both New World and Old World machines are based on.

New World ROM Macs are the first Macs where direct usage of the Open Firmware (OF) subsystem is encouraged. Previous PCI Power Macs used Open Firmware for booting, but the implementation was not complete; in these machines OF was only expected to probe PCI devices, then immediately hand control over to the Mac OS ROM. Because of this, versions 1.0.5 and 2.x had several serious bugs, as well as missing functionality (such as being able to load files from a HFS partition or a TFTP server). Apple also set the default input and output devices to (the modem port on beige Macs), which made it difficult for normal users to get to Open Firmware; to do so it was necessary to either hook up a terminal, or change the Open Firmware settings from inside Mac OS using a tool such as &quot;Boot Variables&quot; or Apple&#x27;s &quot;System Disk&quot;.

The New World ROM introduced a much-improved version of the Open Firmware interpreter, version 3.0, which added many missing features, fixed most of the bugs from earlier versions, and had the capability to run CHRP &quot;boot scripts&quot;. The Toolbox ROM was embedded inside a CHRP script in the System Folder called &quot;Mac OS ROM&quot;, along with a short loader stub and a copy of the Happy Mac icon suitable for display from Open Firmware. Once the ROM was loaded from disk, the Mac boot sequence continued as usual. As before, Open Firmware could also run a binary boot loader, and version 3.0 added support for ELF objects as well as the XCOFF files versions 1.0.5 and 2.0 supported. Also, version 3.0 (as well as some of the last releases of version 2.x, starting with the PowerBook 3400) officially supported direct access to the Open Firmware command prompt from the console (by setting the &quot;auto-boot?&quot; variable to &quot;false&quot; from Mac OS, or by holding down --- at boot). 

One major difference between Old World ROM Macs and New World ROM Macs, at least in Classic Mac OS, is that the Gestalt selector for the machine type is no longer usable; all New World ROM Macs use the same mach ID, 406 decimal, and the actual machine ID is encoded in the &quot;model&quot; and &quot;compatible&quot; properties of the root node of the Open Firmware device tree. The New World ROM also sets the &quot;compatible&quot; property of the root node to &quot;MacRISC2&quot; (machines that can boot Classic Mac OS using &quot;Mac OS ROM&quot;) or &quot;MacRISC3&quot; (machines that can only boot Mac OS X or another Unix-like system).

It is somewhat easier to boot a non-Mac-OS operating system on a New World system, and indeed OpenBSD&#x27;s bootloader only works on a New World system. 

The simplest way to distinguish a New World ROM Mac is that it will have a factory built-in USB port. No Old World ROM Mac had a USB port as factory equipment; instead, they used ADB for keyboard and mouse, and mini-DIN-8 &quot;modem&quot; and &quot;printer&quot; serial ports for other peripherals. Also, New World ROM Macs generally do not have a built-in floppy drive.

<text>Helen Mary Caldicott (born 7 August 1938) is an Australian physician, author, and anti-nuclear advocate. She founded several associations dedicated to opposing the use of nuclear power, depleted uranium munitions, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons proliferation, and military action in general.

==Early life and education==
Helen Caldicott was born on 7 August 1938, in Melbourne, Australia, the daughter of factory manager [Theo] Philip Broinowski and Mary Mona Enyd (Coffey) Broinowski, an interior designer. She attended public school, except for four years at Fintona Girls&#x27; School at Balwyn, a private secondary school. When she was 17, she enrolled at the University of Adelaide medical school and graduated in 1961 with a MBBS degree. In 1962, she married William Caldicott, a paediatric radiologist who has since worked with her in her campaigns. They have three children, Philip, Penny, and William Jr.

Caldicott and her husband moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1966 and she entered a three-year fellowship in nutrition at Harvard Medical School. Returning to Adelaide in 1969, she accepted a position in the renal unit of Queen Elizabeth Hospital. In the early 1970s, she completed a year&#x27;s residency and a two-year internship in paediatrics at the Adelaide Childrens Hospital to qualify as a paediatric physician so she could legitimately establish the first Australian clinic for cystic fibrosis at the Adelaide Childrens Hospital. The clinic now has the best survival rates in Australia. In 1977, she joined the staff of the Children&#x27;s Hospital Medical Center in Boston as an instructor in pediatrics. She taught paediatrics at the Harvard Medical School from 1977 to 1980.

==Anti-nuclear activism==
===Early activity===

Caldicott&#x27;s interest in nuclear issues was sparked when she read the 1957 Nevil Shute book &quot;On the Beach&quot;, a novel about a nuclear holocaust set in Australia.

In the 1970s, she gained prominence in Australia, New Zealand and North America, speaking on the health hazards of radiation from the perspective of paediatrics. Her early achievements included convincing Australia to sue France over its atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific in 1971 and 1972, which brought the practice to an end. She also informed Australian trade unions about the medical and military dangers of uranium mining, which led to the three-year banning of the mining and export of uranium.

After visiting the Soviet Union in 1979 with an AFSC delegation and upon learning the impending US deployment of cruise missiles (which would end arms control) and Pershing II missiles that could hit Moscow from Europe in 3 minutes, Caldicott left her medical career to concentrate on calling the world&#x27;s attention to what she referred to as the &quot;insanity&quot; of the nuclear arms race and the growing reliance on nuclear power. In 1978 she reinvigorated Physicians for Social Responsibility. Over time she and others recruited 23,000 physicians to this organisation which, through wide educational efforts, taught the US public about the dire medical implications of both nuclear power and nuclear war. In 1985 this national organisation and many others, she founded around the world were awarded the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize. She was herself nominated for the Nobel Prize by Linus Pauling, himself a Nobel winner.

In 1980, she founded the Women&#x27;s Action for Nuclear Disarmament (WAND) in the United States, which was later renamed Women&#x27;s Action for New Directions. It is a group dedicated to reducing or redirecting government spending away from nuclear energy and nuclear weapons towards what the group perceives as unmet social issues.

Caldicott stood as an independent candidate for the Australian House of Representatives at the 1990 federal election, contesting the Division of Richmond, against the Leader of the National Party, Charles Blunt. She polled 23.3% of the votes; not enough to win, but her preferences went mostly to the Labor candidate, Neville Newell, electing him and unseating Blunt.

In 2002 Caldicott released &quot;The New Nuclear Danger&quot;, a commentary on the George Bush Military-Industrial Complex. The book was reviewed by Ivan Eland of The Independent Institute. He wrote, &quot;She makes many cogent criticisms about current and prior administrations’ nuclear policies and the excesses of the government-dominated military-industrial complex associated with nuclear weapons, but her often valid points are undermined by other far-fetched or alarmist arguments, sloppy research, and haphazard footnoting.&quot;

In 2008 Caldicott founded the Helen Caldicott Foundation for a Nuclear Free Future which, for over four years, produced a weekly radio commentary, &quot;If You Love This Planet&quot;.

In April 2011, Caldicott was involved in a public argument in &quot;The Guardian&quot; with British journalist George Monbiot. Monbiot expressed great concern at what he saw as a failure by Caldicott to provide adequate justification for any of her arguments. Regarding Caldicott&#x27;s book &quot;Nuclear Power is Not The Answer&quot;, he wrote: &quot;The scarcity of references to scientific papers and the abundance of unsourced claims it contains amaze me.&quot; Caldicott claimed, &quot;As we have seen, he and other nuclear industry apologists sow confusion about radiation risks and, in my view, in much the same way that the tobacco industry did in previous decades about the risks of smoking.&quot; Also in 2011, Caldicott made a written submission regarding the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station new build project in Canada in which she asserts that plutonium can cause cancer of the testicles after accumulation in these organs.

In 2014, Physicians for Social Responsibility hosted a lecture on &quot;Fukushima&#x27;s Ongoing Impact&quot; by Caldicott in Seattle, Washington.

==Honors and awards==
Caldicott has been awarded 21 honorary doctoral degrees. In 1982, she received the Humanist of the Year award from the American Humanist Association. In 1992, Caldicott received the 1992 Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston for her leadership in the worldwide disarmament movement. She was inducted to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001. She was awarded the Lannan Foundation Prize for Cultural Freedom in 2003, and in 2006, the Peace Organisation of Australia presented her with the inaugural Australian Peace Prize &quot;for her longstanding commitment to raising awareness about the medical and environmental hazards of the nuclear age&quot;. The Smithsonian Institution has named Caldicott as one of the most influential women of the 20th century. She is a member of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS, a progressive think tank in Spain. She serves on the Advisory Council of the Nuclear Age Peace. In 2009, she was designated a Women&#x27;s History Month Honoree by the National Women&#x27;s History Project.

==Bibliography==
==Documentary films==
Caldicott has appeared in numerous documentary films and television programs. In the early 1980s, she was the subject of two documentaries: the Oscar-nominated 1981 feature-length film &quot;Eight Minutes to Midnight: A Portrait of Dr. Helen Caldicott&quot; and the 1982 Oscar-winning National Film Board of Canada short documentary, &quot;If You Love This Planet&quot;.

A 2004 documentary film, &quot;Helen&#x27;s War: Portrait of a Dissident&quot;, provides a look into Caldicott&#x27;s life through the eyes of her niece, filmmaker Anna Broinowski.

Caldicott is featured along with foreign affairs experts, space security activists and military officials in interviews in Denis Delestrac&#x27;s 2010 feature documentary &quot;Pax Americana and the Weaponization of Space&quot;.

The 2013 documentary &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Promise&quot; also features footage of Caldicott, interspersed with counter-points to her assertions regarding the health impacts of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

<text>The LA engine is a family of overhead-valve small-block 90° V-configured gasoline engines built by Chrysler Corporation between 1964 and 2003. Primarily V8s, the line includes a single V6 and V10, both derivations of its Magnum series introduced in 1992. A replacement of the Chrysler A engine, they were factory-installed in passenger vehicles, trucks and vans, commercial vehicles, marine and industrial applications. Their combustion chambers are wedge-shaped, rather than polyspheric, as in the A engine, or hemispheric in the Chrysler Hemi. LA engines have the same bore spacing as the A engines.

LA engines were made at Chrysler&#x27;s Mound Road Engine plant in Detroit, Michigan, as well as plants in Canada and Mexico. The &quot;LA&quot; stands for &quot;Light A,&quot; as the 1956–1967 &quot;A&quot; engine it was closely based on and shares many parts with was nearly 50 pounds heavier. The &quot;LA&quot; and &quot;A&quot; production overlapped from 1964–1966 in the U.S. and through 1967 in export vehicles when the &quot;A&quot; 318 engine was phased out.

The basic design of the LA engine would go unchanged through the development of the &quot;Magnum&quot; upgrade (1992–1993), and continue into the 2000s with changes to enhance power and efficiency.

==239 V6==
The V6 was introduced with the Dodge Dakota for 1987, and replaced the older, longer Slant-Six in the Dodge Ram trucks and vans for 1988. It is essentially a six-cylinder version of the 318 V8. The bore and stroke are 99.3 mm (3.9 in) and 84 mm (3.3 in), respectively. Output was and until it was replaced by the 3.9 L Magnum starting in 1992. In 1987, it used a two-barrel Holley carburetor and hydraulic valve lifters. In 1988, it was upgraded with throttle-body fuel injection and roller lifters. For the 1992 Magnum update, the throttle-body fuel injection was upgraded to a multi-port fuel injection system. In 1997, it was then upgraded to sequential fuel injection. The engine was produced through 2003 before it was replaced with the 3.7 L PowerTech V6.

==273 V8==
The was the first LA engine, beginning model year 1964 and offered through 1969, rated at . It had a bore and stroke of . It had hydraulic lifters generally make for a quieter valvetrain. The reciprocating assembly included a cast or forged steel crankshaft, drop forged steel connecting rods and cast aluminum pistons. The valvetrain consisted of a cast nodular iron camshaft, solid or hydraulic lifters, solid pushrods, and shaft-mounted, malleable iron rocker arms (stamped steel on later hydraulic-cam engines). These actuated the overhead steel intake and exhaust valves. The cylinder heads featured wedge-shaped combustion chambers with a single intake and a single exhaust valve for each cylinder. Spark plugs were located in the side of the cylinder head, between the exhaust ports.

A high-performance was offered from 1965 to 1967; called the &quot;Commando&quot;, it was standard in the Barracuda Formula S model and optional in all other compact models excluding station wagons. It featured a 4-barrel carburetor and matching intake manifold, chrome unsilenced air cleaner with callout sticker, longer-duration and higher-lift camshaft and stronger valve springs, 10.5:1 compression ratio, and special black wrinkle valve covers with extruded aluminum appliqués. It was fitted to a low-restriction exhaust system with a exhaust pipe, collector-type Y-junction, and exposed resonator. For 1965 (only), the muffler was of &quot;straight through&quot; construction.

A special version, exclusive to the 1966 Dodge Dart, was available. It used a lift solid-lifter camshaft, fabricated-steel-tube exhaust, and a Holley 4-barrel carburetor, producing (1 hp/cu in). The car so equipped was called the &quot;D-Dart,&quot; a reference to its classification in NHRA D-stock for drag racing, which was the car&#x27;s only intended purpose.

== 318 V8==
The LA 318 has a bore and stroke of , identical to the A 318 it was derived from. It appeared in volume production beginning with the 1968 model year, replacing the last of the export &quot;A&quot; 318 engines equipped with polyspherical chambered heads (&quot;A&quot; 318 engines were not offered in 1967 domestic vehicles). The LA engine was available until 1991, when it was superseded by the Magnum version. It used hydraulic lifters and a two-barrel carburetor for most of its production, though four-barrel Carter Thermo-Quad and Rochester Quadrajet carburetors were used in police applications starting in 1978 and 1985, respectively. The 318 two-barrel ELD received roller lifters and a fast-burn chambered cylinder head in 1985 (the four-barrel police ELE 318 continued to use modified J heads and hydraulic flat valve lifters through 1989).

Throttle-body electronic fuel injection was factory equipment on the 1981–1983 Imperial. From 1988 to 1991, another throttle-body fuel injection system was used for truck and van applications.

==340 V8==
In the mid-1960s, Chrysler decided to adapt the small block V8 into a lightweight, high output engine equally suited for drag strip or street performance use. Its block was bored out to but its stroke left unchanged, resulting in the engine introduced for the 1968 model year. Anticipating higher loads resulting from racing operation, the engineers fitted a forged shot peened steel crankshaft instead of the cast steel unit used in the 318. This also included shot peened hammer-forged steel connecting rods and high compression cast aluminum pistons with full floating pins. A 4-barrel carburetor was mated to a high-rise, dual plane intake manifold feeding high-flow cylinder heads Its big ports used intake and exhaust valves. An aggressive cam was fitted to take advantage of the much better breathing top end. The 1968 4-speed cars got an even hotter cam, but it was discontinued for 1969, where both automatic and manual cars shared the same cam. The engine was equipped with hydraulic lifters and two bolt main bearing caps, leading some to initially underestimate the 340&#x27;s potential. The 1968–71 340&#x27;s compression ratio was 10.5:1, placing it near the limit of what was possible on pump gasoline during that era. The 340 also used additional heavy-duty parts, such as a double-row roller timing chain and sump-mounted windage tray. Power output was officially stated as gross for the 4 barrel.

In 1970, Chrysler introduced a special triple carburetor version of the 340 with triple 2-barrels at gross. Exclusively called the catchy Six-Pack on the Trans-Am targeted Dodge Challenger TA models, the same configuration was used by Plymouth for its Trans-Am AAR &#x27;Cuda, called just the &quot;340-6&quot; or &quot;six barrel&quot;. This race-oriented version of the already high-performance 340 featured an aluminum intake manifold mounting three Holley carburetors, a dual points ignition system, and a heavy duty short block with additional webbing to allow for aftermarket installed 4 bolt main bearing caps. The application-specific cylinder heads featured relocated intake pushrod passages with offset rocker arms that allowed the pushrods to be moved away from the intake ports, which could improve airflow if the pushrod-clearance &quot;hump&quot; was ground away from the intake port by the end user.

The combination of increasingly stringent emission controlss, lowered octane, rising gasoline prices, and insurance company crackdown on high-performance vehicles saw the relatively expensive 340 detuned in 1972 with the introduction of low compression (8.5:1) small valve heads, and by mid-year a cast nodular iron crankshaft and a variety of other emissions related changes. For the 1974 model year, it was replaced by the engine.

==360 V8==

The LA has a bore and stroke of . It was released in 1971 with a two-barrel carburetor. The 360 used the large intake port 340 heads with a smaller intake valve of . In 1974, with the introduction of the code E58 4-barrel dual-exhaust version, at SAE net, it became the most powerful LA engine with the end of 340 production. Power started dropping from 1975 on as more emission controls were added resulting with the 1980 E58 engine only producing SAE net. Starting with 1981, the 360 was exclusively used in Dodge trucks and vans.

The 1978–1979 Li&#x27;l Red Express truck used a special high-performance 360 4-barrel engine with factory production code EH1 that was rated at 225 SAE Net HP in production form The EH1 was a modified version of the E58 360 police engine (E58) producing net at 3800 rpm due in part, that as it was installed in a &quot;truck&quot;, and not a car, it did not have to use catalytic converters (1978 only) which allowed for a free-flowing exhaust system. Some prototypes for the EH1 featured Mopar Performance W2 heads, although the production units had the standard 360 heads. Some police package cars came from the factory with a steel crank and h-beam rods. There was also a &quot;lean burn&quot; version of the 360. The LA360 was replaced in 1993 by the 5.9 Magnum, which shared some design parameters with the LA360, but the majority of its components were different.

Due to additional modifications, the prototype Li&#x27;l Red Express truck tested by various period magazines ran appreciably stronger than actual production examples.

==Throttle-body injected LA engines==
The last variation of the LA series to be introduced before the Magnum upgrade was the 1988–92 throttle-body fuel injected, roller cam engine. The first engines to receive these modifications were the V8 and V6 engines. A Holley/Chrysler-designed, single-point, twin-injector throttle body assembly was mounted atop a slightly redesigned cast iron intake manifold. An in-tank electric pump and reservoir replaced the earlier mechanical (camshaft-eccentric driven) pump. The valvetrain was upgraded to include hydraulic roller lifters; however, cam specifications remained essentially unchanged. The resulting engine was somewhat improved as to power and efficiency. The 5.9 L V8 engines followed suit in 1989, but also received the overall improved &quot;308&quot; cylinder heads (casting number 4448308) that featured significantly higher flowing exhaust ports and a return to the original 1971 (non-fast burn) combustion chamber. However, with other manufacturers already introducing the superior multi-point fuel injection system, Chrysler considered a more drastic upgrade program.

As the TBI engines were being introduced, the new upgrade program was initiated in the Chrysler engineering department. In 1992, with emissions standards becoming ever more stringent in the United States, Chrysler Corporation released the first of the upgraded engines.

==Magnum engines==
In 1992, Chrysler introduced the first of a series of upgraded versions of the LA engines. The company named their engine the &quot;Magnum,&quot; a marketing term that had been used by the company previously to describe both the Dodge Magnum automobile and an earlier Dodge passenger car (only) engine series; the latter was based on the big-block B/RB V8 engines of the 1960s–70s.

The Chrysler Magnum engines are a series of V6, V8, and V10 powerplants used in a number of Chrysler Corporation motor vehicles, as well as in marine and industrial applications. This family of gasoline-burning engines lasted for over a decade, were installed in vehicles sold across the globe, and were produced in the millions.

=== Technical information ===
The Magnum engine is a direct descendant of the Chrysler LA engine, which began with the V8 in 1964. While the Magnum 3.9, Magnum 5.2, and Magnum 5.9 (1992 and up) engines were significantly based on the 239, the 318, and the 360, respectively, many of the parts will not directly interchange and the Magnums are not technically LA engines; the only major parts that are actually unchanged are the connecting rods.

The cylinder block remained basically the same. It was still a V-shaped, 90-degree design made of cast iron. The crankshaft, located to the bottom of the block by five main bearing caps, was cast steel, and the eight connecting rods were forged steel. The pistons were cast aluminum, with a hypereutectic design. Cylinders were numbered from the front of the engine to the rear; cylinders 1, 3, 5, and 7 were found on the left (driver side) bank, or &quot;bank 1,&quot; with the even numbers on the other bank.

Coolant passages were located between the cylinders. The gerotor-type oil pump was located at the bottom-rear of the engine, and provided oil to both the crankshaft main bearings and the cylinder heads (via the lifters and pushrods, as opposed to a bored passage on LA engines). 
Chrysler&#x27;s engineers also redesigned the oil seals on the crankshaft to improve anti-leak seal performance. The oil pan was also made from thicker steel, and was installed with a more leak-resistant silicone-rubber gasket.

Gasoline was supplied to the intake manifold through a pair of steel rails that fed eight Bosch-type, top-fed, electronically actuated fuel injectors; there was one injector located in each intake runner. Each cylinder had its own injector, thus making the fuel system a &quot;multi-point&quot; type. Fuel pressure was regulated by a vacuum-controlled pressure regulator, located on the return side of the second fuel rail. Excess fuel was thereafter delivered back to the fuel tank. (Later versions had the regulator and filter mounted at the in-tank pump.)

To support the new fuel system, the intake manifold was of a new design. Known colloquially as the &quot;beer keg&quot; or &quot;kegger&quot; manifold, the part was shaped like half of a beer barrel lying longitudinally atop the center of the V-shaped engine block. The intake runners, which supplied the fuel and air to each cylinder, fed each of the intake ports in the newly designed cylinder heads. The bolts that secured the intake manifold to the cylinder heads were installed at a different angle from those on the older LA engine; they threaded in vertically, rather than at the 45-degree angle of the 1966 and up LA.

Air was provided from the air filter intake to the intake manifold by a Holley-designed, aluminum, twin-venturi, mechanically actuated throttle body, which was bolted atop the intake manifold. Each venturi was progressively bored and had a diameter of 50mm. To this unit were mounted the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor and Idle Air Control (IAC) valve (initially referred to as the &quot;AIS Motor&quot;). A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage at the side of the throttle body, which acted to open the air intake butterfly valves inside the venturis. During idle these butterfly valves were closed, so a bypass port and the IAC valve were used to control the intake of air.

The cylinder heads were another fundamental change of the Magnum engine, being designed to meet stricter requirements in both power and emissions by increasing efficiency. These heads were cast iron units with new wedge-shaped combustion chambers and high-swirl valve shrouding. Combustion chamber design was most important in these new heads: LA engine cylinder heads were given a full-relief open-chamber design, but the Magnum was engineered with a double-quench closed-chamber type. The higher-flowing intake ports stepped up intake flow dramatically in comparison to the original LA heads, and the exhaust ports improved cylinder evacuation as well. The shape and porting of the chambers allowed for more complete atomization of the air/fuel mixture, as well as contributing to more complete combustion; these virtues allowed for much greater efficiency of the engine as a whole. The intake and exhaust valves were located at the top of each combustion chamber. The valves themselves had shorter, 5/16&quot; diameter stems, to allow for the more aggressive camshaft. Intake valves had a port diameter of 1.92&quot;, while exhaust valves were 1.600&quot;, with 60cc combustion chambers. Spark plugs were located at the peak of the combustion chambers&#x27; wedge, between the exhaust ports; press-in heat shields protected them from the heat of the exhaust manifolds.

Cast iron exhaust manifolds, less restrictive than units found on previous engines, were bolted to the outboard side of each head. The new cylinder heads also featured stud-mounted rocker arms, a change from the shaft-mounted LA arms. This last change was due to the different oiling system of the new engine, as described in the next paragraph. The valve covers on the Magnum have 10 bolts rather than the previous 5, for improved oil sealing. In addition, the valve covers were made of thicker steel than earlier parts, and were installed with a silicone gasket.

The valvetrain was also updated, although it was still based on a single, center-block located camshaft pushing on hydraulic lifters and pushrods, one for each rocker arm. However, the cast nodular iron camshaft was of the &quot;roller&quot; type, with each lobe acting upon a hydraulic lifter with a roller bearing on the bottom; this made for a quieter, cooler-running valvetrain, but also allowed for a more aggressive valve lift. Each of the lifters acted upon a steel pushrod, which were of the &quot;oil-through&quot; type. This was another change for the Magnum. Because the new pushrods also served to provide oil to the top of the cylinder head, the rockers were changed to the AMC-style, screw-mounted, bridged half-shaft type. The new rockers also had a higher ratio: 1.6:1 compared to 1.5:1 in the LA engine, which increased leverage on the valves. In addition, the oil boss located at the end of the cylinder head on the LA engine was left undrilled, as it was no longer needed. However, the boss itself was left in place, perhaps to cut down on casting and machining costs, and to allow the use of earlier LA heads.

Engine timing was controlled by the all-steel, silent Morse timing chain (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover at the front of the engine block. The timing chain sprockets, one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years, the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a redesigned, counterclockwise rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.

The ignition system was also all-new for the Magnum. Controlled by a new micro-processor-equipped Single-Board Engine Controller (SBEC, also known as the ECM, or Engine Control Module), the ignition system included a distributor mounted at the rear of the engine. A 36,000-volt ignition coil, usually located at the front right of the engine, provided electrical power to the center of the distributor cap, where a spinning rotor directed the power to each of the individual cylinders&#x27; spark plug wires. Ignition dwell, advance and retardation were electronically controlled by the SBEC.

The SBEC controlled the ignition, as well as the opening and closing of the fuel injectors. During cold startup, wide-open throttle and deceleration, it did this based on &quot;open-loop,&quot; pre-programmed operating parameters. During normal idle and cruising, it began &quot;closed-loop&quot; operation, during which the module acted based upon inputs from a variety of sensors. The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the Oxygen sensor (O2), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and Coolant Temperature sensor (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC&#x27;s outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve. The latter controlled idle characteristics. However, the SBEC also controlled the operation of the charging system, air conditioning system, cruise control and, in some vehicles, transmission shifting. By centralizing control of these systems, the operation of the vehicle was simplified and streamlined.

Emissions output was controlled by several systems. The EGR, or Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, brought exhaust gas from the exhaust stream up to the intake manifold, lowering peak combustion temperatures, the goal being the reduction of NOX emissions. A PCV, or Positive Crankcase Ventilation system, introduced oil vapor and unburnt fuel vapors from the crankcase to the intake, allowing the engine to re-use these as well. Furthermore, gasoline vapors that would normally be released into the atmosphere were captured by the EVAP system, to then be introduced into the engine.

In 1996, the OBD-II on-board diagnostics system was introduced on all passenger vehicles in the United States, as per United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation. As such, a new engine control computer was developed for vehicles powered by Magnum engines, known as the JTEC. The new Powertrain Control Module was more complex and more intelligent, and added programming meant it could also control automatic transmission and other powertrain functions; its firmware could also be reprogrammed (&quot;reflashed&quot;) via the same OBD-II port. With the introduction of the JTEC, the EGR system was dropped from Magnum engines.

=== Magnum 3.9 L V6 ===
As the 5.2 L V8 was introduced in 1992, the often-forgotten V6 version of the Magnum engine became available in the Ram pickup and the more compact Dodge Dakota. Based on the LA-series V6, the 3.9 L Magnum featured the same changes and upgrades as the other Magnum engines. The 3.9 L is essentially a 5.2 L V8 with two cylinders removed.

Power increased substantially to at 4,400 rpm and from at 3,200 rpm, as compared with the previous TBI engine. For 1994, horsepower was reduced to , mostly because of the installation of smaller-volume exhaust manifolds; torque ratings remained the same. For 1997, the 3.9 L engine&#x27;s torque output was increased to , with a compression ratio of 9.1:1. Firing order was 1-6-5-4-3-2. This engine was last produced for the 2003 Dodge Dakota pickup. Starting in the 2004 model year, it was entirely withdrawn from production and replaced with the 3.7L PowerTech V6 engine.

Applications:
* 1992–2003 Dodge Dakota
* 1992–2003 Dodge Ram Van/Dodge Ram Wagon
* 1992–2001 Dodge Ram

=== Magnum 5.2 L V8 ===

The 5.2 L Magnum, released in 1992, was an evolutionary development of the LA engine with the same displacement. The 5.2 L was the first of the Magnum upgraded engines, followed in 1993 by the 5.9 L V8 and the 3.9 L V6.

At the time of its introduction, the 5.2 L Magnum created at 4,100 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. Production of this engine lasted until 2003, when it was completely replaced by the newer 4.7 L PowerTech SOHC V8 engine.

=== Magnum 5.9 L V8 ===
In 1993, Chrysler Corporation released the next member of the Magnum family: the 5.9 L V8. This was based on the LA-series engine, and included the same upgrades and design features as the 5.2 L. The standard 5.9 L produced at 4,000 rpm and at 3,200 rpm; torque was increased to at 2,800 rpm in the heavy-duty version. It was upgraded in 1998 to at 4,000 rpm and at 3,250 rpm. The 5.9 L came factory-installed in 1998–2001 Dodge Dakota R/T pickups and 2000–2003 Dodge Durango R/T SUVs. It was also installed in the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 5.9, only available in 1998. The 5.9 L Magnum was available until the 2003 model year, when it was replaced with the 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine.

Although the pre-Magnum (1971–92) and Magnum versions of the are both externally balanced, the two are balanced differently (the Magnum version uses lighter pistons) and each requires a uniquely balanced damper, flywheel, drive plate, or torque converter. Bore and stroke size was ; compression ratio was 9.1:1.

=== Magnum 8.0 L V10 ===
The Magnum V10 was a V10 engine designed for use in Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks, which made its debut in 1994 and was produced through 2003. Although Chrysler had already introduced an aluminum block Lamborghini-influenced V10 in the 1991 Dodge Viper, this engine&#x27;s roots trace to the genesis of the 5.2 L Magnum V8 in 1988.

The Magnum V10 has a cast iron block, and was rated for (1994–1998) and (1999–2003) at 4,100 rpm and at 2,400 rpm. Bore and stroke were ; compression ratio was 8.4:1; firing order was 1-10-9-4-3-6-5-8-7-2. Valve covers were die-cast magnesium (AZ91D alloy), rather than stamped steel; this lowered noise levels and made for better gasket sealing. 

The Magnum V10 first became available in the 1994 model year Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 (above 8,500 pounds GVWR), and was the most powerful gasoline-burning engine then available in any truck of that class.

Applications:
* 1994–2003 Dodge Ram 2500/3500

==Crate engines==

Chrysler has offered a line of crate engines based on the Magnum designed to bolt into older muscle cars and street rods with little modification. Some of the changes to facilitate this were using a 1970–93 coolant pump so that older pulleys and brackets could be used, as well as an intake manifold that uses a carburetor instead of electronic fuel injection. With a high lift cam and single plane intake, the crate Magnum was rated at with the Magnum heads. Later models equipped with &quot;R/T&quot; or aluminum cylinder heads produced . A bolt-in fuel injection conversion kit has also been available.

<text>Old World ROM computers are the Macintosh (Mac) models that use a Macintosh Toolbox read-only memory (ROM) chip, usually in a socket (but soldered to the motherboard in some models). All Macs prior to the iMac, the iBook, the Blue and White Power Mac G3 and the Bronze Keyboard (Lombard) PowerBook G3 use Old World ROM, while said models, as well as all subsequent models until the introduction of the Intel-based EFI Models, are New World ROM machines. In particular, the Beige Power Mac G3 and all other beige and platinum-colored Power Macs are Old World ROM machines. In common use, the &quot;Old World&quot; designation usually applies to the early generations of PCI-based &quot;beige&quot; Power Macs (and sometimes the first NuBus-equipped models), but not the older Motorola 68000-based Macs; however, the Toolbox runs the same way on all three types of machines.

==Details==
PCI Power Macs with an Old World ROM contain an Open Firmware implementation, and a copy of the Macintosh Toolbox as an Open Firmware device. These machines are set to boot from this device by default, thus starting the normal Macintosh startup procedure. This can be changed, just as on New World ROM Macs, but with limitations placed on what devices and formats can be used; on these machines, particularly the early machines like the Power Macintosh 9500, the Open Firmware implementation was just enough to enumerate PCI devices and load the Toolbox ROM, and these Open Firmware revisions have several bugs which must be worked around by boot loaders or nvramrc patches. The Open Firmware environment can be entered by holding the key combination while booting.

All Power Macs emulate a 68LC040 CPU inside a nanokernel; this emulator is then used to boot the predominantly 68k-based Toolbox, and is also used to support applications written for the 68k processor. Once Toolbox is running, PPC machines can boot into Mac OS directly.

On all Old World ROM machines, once Toolbox is loaded, the boot procedure is the same. Toolbox executes a memory test, enumerates Mac OS devices it knows about (this varies from model to model), and either starts the on-board video (if present) or the option ROM on a NuBus or PCI video card. Toolbox then checks for a disk in the floppy drive, and scans all SCSI buses for a disk with a valid System Folder, giving preference to whatever disk is set as the startup disk in the parameter RAM.

If a bootable disk is found, the Happy Mac logo is displayed, and control is handed over to the Mac OS. If no disk to boot from is present, an icon depicting a floppy disk with a blinking question mark in the middle will be displayed. If a hardware problem occurs during the early part of the boot process, the machine will display the Sad Mac icon with a hexadecimal error code and freeze; on Macs made after 1987, this will be accompanied by the Chimes of Death sound.

Since the Old World ROM usually boots to Toolbox, most OSs have to be installed using a boot loader from inside Mac OS (BootX is commonly used for Linux installations). 68K-based Macs and NuBus Power Macs &quot;must&quot; have Mac OS installed to load another OS (even A/UX, which was an Apple product), usually with virtual memory turned off. PCI Power Macs can be configured to boot into Open Firmware, allowing the firmware to load a boot loader directly, or they can use a specially-prepared floppy disk to trick the Toolbox into loading a kernel (this is used for Linux installation floppy images).

The simplest way to identify an Old World ROM Mac is that it will not have a factory built-in USB port. Only New World ROM Macs featured a USB port as factory equipment.

<text>Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Lee Rawlinson (born 19 May 1972) is a former track and field athlete who competed in the 400 metre hurdles.

==Life and career==
He also appeared in the 1995 series of the TV series &quot;Gladiators&quot;.

After trying the pole vault, decathlon and 110 m hurdles in his early career, Rawlinson found the gruelling 400 m hurdles to be his best event.

A graduate of Loughborough University, until 2020 Rawlinson held the world best of 34.48 seconds for the rarely run 300 m hurdles, which he set at Sheffield, England on 30 June 2002.

In July 2004 he ranked third on the United Kingdom all-time list for the 400 m hurdles with a time of 48.14 seconds, set in 1999 at Zürich, Switzerland. In the build-up to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, Rawlinson was ranked number five in the world by the IAAF.

Rawlinson retired from competitive athletics at the end of 2005 at the age of 33.

He married Australian athlete Jana Pittman on 31 March 2006.

Now married to Catherine Clark, sports administrator, they have 2 sons.

<text>María del Rosario Valdez Campos (28 May 1945 – 19 June 2016), known professionally as Chayito Valdez, was a Mexican singer and actress from Sinaloa. She was associated with and contributed to the folk music of Mexico.

==Biography==
Valdez was born in Orba, Guasave Municipality, Sinaloa. She started her music career at an early age participating in amateur competitions with songs such as &quot;La Cigarra&quot;, &quot;Historia de un amor&quot;, &quot;La Bikina&quot;, and &quot;Leña de Pirul&quot;. Her godmother was Amalia Mendoza, a successful singer known as &quot;La Tariácuri&quot;, and in the early 1970s, she recorded four songs the Sinaloan city of Los Mochis: &quot;Besos y Copas&quot;, &quot;Una Noche me Embriagué&quot;, &quot;Una Sombra&quot;, and &quot;Amor que Muere&quot;, which earned her a reputation as a Mexican folk singer. She won the fifth &quot;Festival de la Canción Ranchera&quot; with the song &quot;No me pregunten por él&quot;.

Valdez moved to Los Angeles, California in 1982 and became a US citizen. On September 17, 1985, she suffered an automobile accident that left her in a wheelchair, but after a long recovery began making public appearances again. In June 2003 she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and fell into a coma for 50 days. Her last show was in Nogales, Sonora. She spent her last days in a persistent vegetative state in a hospital in Coronado, California, where she died on 19 June 2016.

<text>[[Open joint stock company|JSC]] Uzbekistan Airways, operating as &quot;Uzbekistan Airways&quot; (, ; ), is the flag carrier of Uzbekistan, headquartered in Tashkent. From its hub at Islam Karimov Tashkent International Airport, the airline serves a number of domestic destinations; the company also flies international services to Asia, Europe and North America.

== History ==
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Uzbek President Islam Karimov in 1992 authorised the creation of Uzbekistan Airways. The airline was established on 28 January 1992, and took over the operations of the Uzbekistan division of Aeroflot on 31 May 1992. In 1993, Uzbekistan Airways acquired its first two Airbus A310-300s. The two A310s were counted as part of the fleet , along with Ukrainian and Russian-built aircraft (25 Antonov An-24/26s, one Ilyushin Il-62, 13 Ilyushin Il-76s, one Ilyushin Il-86, 23 Tupolev Tu-154 and three Yakovlev Yak-40s). By this time, the airline was still the sole operator in the country. Late in 1995, the carrier ordered its first Boeing aircraft: two Boeing 767-300ERs and a single Boeing 757.

Uzbekistan Airways was the launch customer for the Ilyushin Il-114; it took delivery of the first, locally assembled aircraft, in July 1998. In June 1998, the airline took delivery of the last-built Airbus A310 ever (msn. 706, reg. UK-31003). Two more Boeing 757-200s were directly ordered from Boeing in April 1999. Late in 1999, the company took ownership of the first of these two 184-seater Boeing 757-200.

<doc id="861484" wikidata="Q5114629" url="?curid=861484" title="Chrysler A engine">
<text>The Chrysler A engine is an OHV small-block V8 gasoline engine built by Chrysler from 1956 until 1967. It featured polyspherical combustion chambers, and was offered in displacements from to , and in various high-power configurations. It began to be replaced by the wedge-head LA engine in 1964, and is not related to the hemispherical-head Hemi engine of the 1950s or 1960s.

The A engine was released in 1956, and was used exclusively in Plymouths until 1958 and in Chryslers and Dodges from 1959 on. The DeSoto and Dodge 270/315/325 poly used similar head architecture but was not related to the Plymouth A Engine, using its own heads and the same bottom end as the Dodge and Desoto Red Ram Hemi. The A engine cylinder bore center distance is , larger than the earlier Dodge-based poly engines. The A engine formed the design basis of the Chrysler LA engine, evidenced in the many parts that interchange between the two engine families.

==Plymouth==
===277===
The 277 &quot;Hy-Fire&quot; was the first A-block engine, produced for 1955 in the fall of 1954 and sharing almost nothing but the basic concepts with other engines built by Chrysler. Bore is and stroke is for a piston displacement of . It was replaced by the 301 in 1957, except for in low-priced Plaza models where it continued to be used during the 1957 model year. Power for the two-barrel version is ; this increased to for the four-barrel &quot;Power Pack&quot; version which also came equipped with dual exhausts. The Power Pack was also fitted to the Facel Vega FV3, of which 48 examples were built in 1956 and 1957.

===301===
The Plymouth 301 replaced the 277 in 1957 and kept that engine&#x27;s stroke. Its piston displacement is , thanks to the larger bore. These dimensions are entirely different from the 1955 Chrysler 301. This engine was also installed in the 1957–1958 Facel Vega FV3B.

===303===
The 1956 Plymouth 303 displaces and uses the same connecting rods as the 277; the bore is and the stroke is .

This engine was used in the following vehicles:
* 1956 Dodge Custom Royal (Canadian)
* 1956 Chrysler Windsor (Canadian)
* 1956 Plymouth Fury, with 4-barrel carburetor
* 1957 standard on all -wheelbase Dodges and Plymouths

===313===
A version of the A engine called the 313 was produced from 1957 to 1967 primarily for Canadian and export markets. This engine has a bore of and the common stroke, and was used in the following vehicles, amongst others:
* 1957 Canadian Dodge Custom Royal
* 1957–1964 Australian Chrysler Royal
* 1958–1967 standard or available in all Canadian-market Dodges and Plymouths except Valiants, Barracudas, and Darts.
* 1961–1963 Bristol 407
* 1963–1965 Bristol 408 Mark I

===318===
The 318 is the most common version of the A engine, produced from 1957 through 1966 in the US and 1967 in some export markets when it was replaced in all markets by the LA 318. Only Plymouth used this 318 in 1957 and 1958, but it was shared with Chrysler from 1959 on and Dodge from 1960 on. It displaces and has a bore and the stroke.

A high-performance version called the V-800, offered in 1957 and 1958, used two four-barrel Carter carburetors to produce , making it the highest-output factory A engine. It was used in the 1957 and 1958 Plymouth Fury, but was also an option on Plymouth models lower in the model range.

Bristol Cars introduced the 318 in the Mark II model of their 408 (in 1965) and continued to use it in the succeeding 409 and 410 until 1969. From 1962 until early 1965, Checker used this engine for their Aerobus limousines.

==Non-Plymouth==
===326===
The 326 was launched in 1959 Dodges. Its actual piston displacement is but it was marketed as a 326 to avoid confusion with the Dodge Red Ram 325. The 326 uses the same stroke as the 318, but with the largest bore of any A engine at . It uses hydraulic valve lifters, unlike the other A engines that used solid lifters, and was used in the 1959 Dodge Coronet.

<text>The Chrysler Slant-Six is the popular name for an overhead valve inline-6 engine produced by Chrysler Motors between 1959 and 2000. Featuring a reverse-flow cylinder head and cylinder bank inclined at a 30-degree angle from vertical, it was introduced in and displacements for the 1960 model year. It was a clean-sheet design known within Chrysler as the G-engine, built as a direct replacement for the flathead Chrysler straight six that the company started business with in 1925. 

The design proved very successful, being utilized in cars, trucks, boats, and agricultural, and industrial applications.

==Design==
The Chrysler Slant Six engine was a clean-sheet design, led by Willem Weertman, later Chrysler&#x27;s chief engine designer. Its characteristic 30° inclined cylinder block gave it a lower height, copying the same cant Mercedes-Benz had introduced in 1952 in its M186-engined 300SL sports car. This enabled Chrysler stylists to lower hood lines, and also made room for the water pump to be mounted with a lateral offset, significantly shortening the engine&#x27;s overall length. The slanted cylinder block also provides space in the vehicle&#x27;s engine bay for intake and exhaust manifolds with runners of longer and more nearly equal length compared to the rake- or log-style manifolds typical of other inline engines. The No. 1 and No. 6 intake runners are of approximately equal length, the No. 2 and No. 5 equal but shorter, and the No. 3 and No. 4 equal and shortest. This has the effect of broadening the torque curve for better performance. The Slant Six manifold configuration gives relatively even distribution of fuel mixture to all cylinders, and presents less flow restriction. This, in turn, provides for relatively good airflow through the engine despite the intake and exhaust ports being on the same side of the head rather than in a crossflow arrangement.

It was introduced in two displacements in 1960: The &quot;LG&quot; (low-G, referring to the relatively short engine block casting and crankshaft stroke) in the compact Valiant, and the &quot;RG&quot; (raised-G, referring to the relatively tall engine block casting and crankshaft stroke) in full-size Plymouth and Dodge Dart models. In 1960, the engine was called the &quot;30-D Economy Six&quot; engine by Plymouth marketers, referring to the 30° cylinder block angle.

The G-engine was offered in various configurations in the North American market until 1983 in cars, 1987 in trucks, and 1991 for marine, agricultural, and industrial use. Replacement engines were built in Mexico through 2000. The G-engine was used by Chrysler&#x27;s international operations in locally produced vehicles. It was also purchased by other original equipment manufacturers for installation in commercial vehicles, agricultural and industrial equipment, and boats.
The G-engine gained a reputation for reliability and durability. The basic design is rigid and sturdy, in part because the engine was designed to be made of either iron or aluminum. An aluminum block was produced in 1961–1963, but most blocks were made of iron. The block is of a deep-skirt design, with the crankshaft axis well above the oil pan rails for structural rigidity. Although only four main bearings are used, they are of the same dimensions as those in the 2G 5-bearing (1964–1971) Hemi, and fewer mains results in a crankshaft better able to withstand the effects of torque. Efficient cooling and lubrication systems, a favorable ratio of connecting rod length to stroke, and a forged steel crankshaft (on engines made through mid-1976) all contributed to the engine&#x27;s strength and durability.

The G-engine was designed for utility and economy, and gave better overall performance than its competitors at its 1960 introduction. It generally kept up through the 1960s and early-1970s with its direct competition, though specialty 6-cylinder engines like the Pontiac OHC Six, a brief GM outlier designed for its sporty Firebird pony car, bested the performance of most versions of the Slant-6. After an early factory racing program was discontinued by 1962, the Slant Six did not receive much performance development. Most Slant Sixes were equipped with a single 1-barrel carburetor. Starting in the early 1970s, primitive emission controls adversely affected driveability and power, though a version of the 2-barrel carburetor package first released for marine and export markets in 1967 was offered in North America from 1977 to 1983 under the &quot;Super Six&quot; name. Performance figures were only slightly higher, but driveability was substantially improved.

Other Chrysler engines were released with more advanced combustion chambers, electronic fuel injection, and other modern improvements, but the length of the Slant Six precluded its use in Chrysler&#x27;s front-wheel-drive cars. A new V6 engine was created for the 1987 Dodge Dakota compact pickup truck by removing two cylinders from the corporate LA V8 engine. It replaced the Slant-6 in the rest of the Dodge truck line at the end of the 1987 model year.

==Significant production changes==
* The combustion chamber shape was slightly modified for 1967 to promote more complete combustion and reduce exhaust emission toxicity.
* All G engines used forged steel crankshafts until the middle of model year 1976, when a less costly cast-iron crankshaft was introduced. The cast crankshaft uses a different block, different main and connecting rod bearings and different connecting rods.
* The counterbore in the rear flange of the crankshaft was diameter until 1967. For 1968, it was enlarged to . This difference has implications when swapping engines with automatic transmissions.
* All G-engines used solid valve lifters through the 1980 model year, with the exception of a small production test of hydraulic lifters in the 1978 model year. For model year 1981, all North American G-engines received top-fed hydraulic lifters. Retrofitment in both directions is possible.
* Emission control devices and systems, carburetor make and specification, and engine assembly details changed over the years to comply with market requirements and preferences.
* Electronic ignition, which had been made available on V8 engines late in 1971, was made standard equipment on all engines including the RG in 1973.
* Induction-hardened exhaust valve seats and upgraded exhaust valves were made standard in 1973 to withstand prolonged operation on no-lead fuel.

==Configuration variants==

===170===
The 170 engine was offered in model years 1960 through 1969 in North America, and through 1971 for export markets. The first vehicle to offer the 170 slant-6 was the 1960 Valiant. The engine has a bore of and a stroke of for an actual displacement of . Connecting rod length is . The &quot;LG&quot; low-deck block was unique to the 170 engine.

===198===
The 198 was introduced in the North American market for model year 1970 as a more powerful base-model engine than the previous 170 engine. The increased displacement gave improved vehicle performance and lower manufacturing cost, for it was achieved with the tall RG block also used with the 225 engine by installing a crankshaft with stroke and connecting rods long, for an actual displacement of . Manufacturing costs were reduced by eliminating using two different blocks for the two different available sizes of slant-6 engine. The 198 engine was available through the 1974 model year.

===225===

The 225 used the RG (tall) block with a bore, a stroke and connecting rods, for an actual displacement of . This undersquare geometry was a departure from the emerging trend towards oversquare engines. It provided strong low-rpm torque characteristics for automobiles and trucks, as well as other commercial and marine applications. The 225 was originally designed and introduced in 1960 for use in full-size models, and it eventually became the best known of the Slant Six engines. The original Chrysler 225 Slant Six produced around at 4,000 rpm and of torque at 2,800 rpm.

In 1982, Chrysler signed an agreement with Perkins Engines to build a dieselized version of the 3.7, with seven main bearings and turbocharged as well as naturally aspirated (and also of the 2.2-liter inline-four) in Windsor, Ontario. Design work had started in 1975, but with the collapse of the diesel market in North America, these plans were cancelled in 1983.

====Aluminum block 225====
Between late model year 1961 and early model year 1963, approximately 52,000 die-cast aluminum RG blocks were produced and installed in passenger cars. These open-deck blocks used integrally cast high-nickel iron cylinder liners, and bolt-in iron upper and lower main bearing caps. Internal components (crank, rods, pistons, etc.) were the same as used in the iron engine, and an iron cylinder head was used with a special copper-asbestos gasket. The aluminum block weighs about less than the iron RG block.

Although serviceable examples can still be found, the aluminum RG tended to undergo delamination between the iron cylinder liner and the surrounding aluminum. Severe corrosion within the block is also commonly found because of the general tendency in the 1960s and 1970s to fill cooling systems in summer with plain water without corrosion inhibitors. Moreover, the open-deck design and primitive head gasket technology are not sufficiently robust to withstand the increased seal demands of increased compression or forced induction.

===High-performance variants===
Most G-engines were equipped with small-capacity carburetors (such as the ubiquitous Holley 1920) and exhaust systems adequate for standard passenger car usage at low altitudes, but which tended to hamper maximum available performance at high altitudes, in heavy or race-purpose vehicles and/or where quicker acceleration was desired. To meet the demand for improved responsiveness, modified engine configurations were made available in various markets over the years.

====Hyper Pak====

The Hyper Pak was a parts package made available from 1960 through 1962 at Chrysler Corporation dealer parts counters. The parts were made available to comply with the regulations of sanctioning bodies for racing events in which Valiants had been entered by factory-backed teams: All parts used had to be &quot;stock&quot; parts, the definition of which meant that they were available through normal factory parts channels. The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept an AFB 4-barrel Carter Carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large-diameter exhaust Y-pipe to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276°-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a manual choke control, a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine&#x27;s compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for installation only on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a high idle speed was required to prevent engine stall-out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving rough idling and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. In competition events it proved unbeatable. Seven factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition. The Valiants came in first through seventh. A high-fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s. Subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment (Clifford Research, 6=8) for inline six-cylinder engines.

====Multiple carburetors====
For the 1965–1968 model years, Chrysler Argentina equipped Valiant GT models with a system of dual 1-barrel Holley RX 7000 A carburetors and other engine specification changes. Claimed output was , compared to the single-carburetor version of the engine producing 

====2-barrel carburetion====

=====Export 2-barrel setup=====

For the 1967 model year, a 2-barrel carburetor setup was released for export production. This configuration, similar to that found on marine G-engines beginning in 1965, consisted of an iron intake manifold with open-plenum 2-barrel carburetor mounting pad, a Carter BBD carburetor, and associated air cleaner, linkage and plumbing changes. Also installed on these export 2-barrel engines was a slightly hotter camshaft (244° duration rather than 240°), and a distributor with modified advance curves. This engine, rated at , was popular in Central and South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Driveability characteristics were generally superior to those of the 1-barrel engine, but to avoid cutting into sales of the more expensive V8 engine, this 2-barrel setup was not offered in the North American market. Of particular note is the automatic choke design found in this export 2-barrel setup. Most Chrysler products used remote automatic chokes, with a bimetal coil spring mounted on the exhaust manifold, exposed to exhaust heat and operating a pushrod which rotated the choke lever on the carburetor. The export 2-barrel setup used an integral heat-tube style automatic choke: Air heated by the exhaust manifold was routed to a round bakelite housing on the carburetor air horn, which contained a bimetal spring acting directly on the choke lever.

=====Slant Six 225 high performance=====
At the end of 1973 Chrysler Argentina returned to the fight for the high performance 6 cylinders.
Since 1972 Chrysler had not offered a 6 cylinder with sports aspiration but that would change with the release of the Dodge Polara RT, it was a hard top coupe equipped with the new high-performance Slant Six RG 225 or commonly known as Slant Six RT, thanks to the addition of a new Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, &quot;3a1&quot; exhaust manifolds, a more violent camshaft with 273° duration; and a compression ratio of 8.5:1 this version produced and torque of , this engine coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and a differential with a ratio of 3.07 to 1 launched the Dodge Polara RT to a maximum speed of 181 km/h or 113 mph and an acceleration of 0 to 63 mph in 11 seconds.

=====Super Six=====
By the mid-1970s in the North American market, emission control regulations were reducing engine performance at the same time as safety regulations were making cars heavier. An increase in performance was required for the G-engine, so a 2-barrel setup was released for the 1976 model year. This was not the same as the export 2-barrel package; the intake manifold used a throttle-bored plenum rather than an open one, and had provisions for an EGR valve. The carburetor, a Carter BBD similar but not identical to the one used on Chrysler&#x27;s V8 engine, used a standard Chrysler-style remote automatic choke. A exhaust head pipe was also provided, as well as 2-barrel-specific advance curves in the ignition distributor. This package, called &quot;Super Six&quot; by the marketing division, brought rated horsepower from and torque from , while improving throttle response and driveability while maintaining compliance with emission laws.

<text>Intercultural communication is a discipline that studies communication across different cultures and social groups, or how culture affects communication. It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense, it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate, and perceive the world around them. Intercultural communication focuses on the recognition and respect of those with cultural differences. The goal is mutual adaptation between two or more distinct cultures which leads to biculturalism/multiculturalism rather than complete assimilation. It promotes the development of cultural sensitivity and allows for empathic understanding across different cultures.

==Description==
Intercultural communication is the idea of knowing how to communicate in different parts of the world. Intercultural communication uses theories within groups of people to achieve a sense of cultural diversity. This is in the hopes of people being able to learn new things from different cultures. The theories used give people an enhanced perspective on when it is appropriate to act in situations without disrespecting the people within these cultures; it also enhances their perspective on achieving cultural diversity through the ideas of intercultural communication.

Many people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted. With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds &quot;interact&quot;. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries.

Learning the tools to facilitate cross-cultural interaction is the subject of cultural agility, a term presently used to design a complex set of competencies required to allow an individual or an organization to perform successfully in cross-cultural situations.

Intercultural communication plays a role in social sciences such as anthropology, cultural studies, linguistics, psychology, and communication studies. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills. Research is a major part of the development of intercultural communication skills. &quot;Intercultural communication&quot; is in a way the &#x27;interaction with speakers of other languages on equal terms and respecting their identities&#x27;.

Identity and culture are also studied within the discipline of communication to analyze how globalization influences ways of thinking, beliefs, values, and identity within and between cultural environments. Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society.

The study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding. Intercultural understanding is the ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.

Intercultural communication is something that is not just needed in the United States, but it is also needed in many other parts of the world. Wherever intercultural communication is, it helps to not only create behaviors between domestic and international contexts but also becomes a shared experience for all.

==Theories==
The following types of theories can be distinguished in different strands: focus on effective outcomes, on accommodation or adaptation, on identity negotiation and management, on communication networks, on acculturation and adjustment.

=== Social engineering effective outcomes ===
*Cultural convergence
**The theory that when two cultures come together, similarities in ideas and aspects will become more prevalent as members of the two cultures get to know one another. In a relatively closed social system, in which communication among members is unrestricted, the system as a whole will tend to &quot;converge&quot; over time toward a state of greater cultural &quot;uniformity&quot;. The system will tend to diverge toward diversity when communication is restricted.
*Communication accommodation theory
**This theory focuses on linguistic strategies to decrease or increase communicative distances. In relation to linguistics, communication accommodation theory is the idea when two people are speaking to one another, one participant modifies the way they speak to accommodate another person in a given context. This is similar to code-switching in the sense that people are changing their dialects from a given language, to adjust to a different setting for others to understand. Communication accommodation theory seeks to explain and predict why, when, and how people adjust their communicative behavior during social interaction and what social consequences result from these adjustments.
*Intercultural adaptation
**Intercultural adaptation is the idea that after living in a culture for an extended period of time, people will start to develop the ideas, rules, values, among other themes of that culture. Adaptation theories conclude that in order to adapt, immigrants need to fully engage in changing one&#x27;s self beliefs to that of the society&#x27;s majority. To elaborate, for example, while someone lives abroad it is imperative they are ready to change in order to live cohesively with their new culture. By understanding intercultural competence, we know that people have an understanding of what it takes to thrive in a culture, by following the norms and ideals that are presented.
**Intercultural adaptation involves learned communicative competence. Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture. Communication competence is an outcomes-based measure conceptualized as functional/operational conformity to environmental criteria such as working conditions. Beyond this, adaptation means &quot;the need to conform&quot; to mainstream &quot;objective reality&quot; and &quot;accepted modes of experience&quot;. 
**Cultural adaptation is the process in which individuals are able to maintain stability and reestablish with their environment while in unfamiliar cultural environments. Intercultural adaptation is a two-way process, this is between the host culture as well as the individuals outside/home culture. This is based on whether the host culture is willing to adapt, adopt cultural sensitivity, and/or adopt some aspects of the incoming individual&#x27;s culture. Intercultural adaptation is a two-way process. 
*Co-cultural theory
**Co-cultural theory is the idea pertaining to a group of people that someone belongs to, with people from different parts of the world sharing characteristics of one another.
**In its most general form, co-cultural communication refers to interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members. Co-cultures include but are not limited to people of color, women, people with disabilities, gay men and lesbians, and those in the lower social classes. Co-cultural theory, as developed by Mark P. Orbe, looks at the strategic ways in which co-cultural group members communicate with others. In addition, a co-cultural framework provides an explanation for how different persons communicate based on six factors.

*Cultural fusion theory
**Cultural fusion theory explains how immigrants can acculturate into the dominant culture they move to. They maintain important aspects of their culture while adopting aspects of the dominant culture. This creates an intercultural identity within an individual, their native identity as well as their new host culture identity. According to Eric Mark Kramer, the first proponent of cultural fusion theory, this theory distinguishes itself from more dominant frameworks, such as cultural adaptation, by focusing on the combination of many cultures not of adapting from one culture to a dominant one.

===Identity negotiation or management===
*Identity management theory
*Identity negotiation
*Cultural identity theory
*Double-swing model

=== Communication networks ===
*Networks and outgroup communication competence
*Intracultural versus intercultural networks
*Networks and acculturation

=== Acculturation and adjustment ===
Acculturation can be defined as the process of an individual or individuals exchanging or adopting certain culture values and practices that the dominant culture of their location possesses. Acculturation differs from assimilation because the people who are adopting new culture habits are still processing some of their original own culture habits. Young Yun Kim has identified three personality traits that could affect someone&#x27;s cultural adaptation. These personality traits include openness, strength, and positive. With these personality traits, individuals will be more successful in acculturating than individuals who do not possess these traits. Kim proposes an alternative to acculturation is complete assimilation.
*Communication acculturation
**This theory attempts to portray &quot;cross-cultural adaptation as a collaborative effort in which a stranger and the receiving environment are engaged in a joint effort.&quot;
*Anxiety/uncertainty management
**When strangers communicate with hosts, they experience uncertainty and anxiety. Strangers need to manage their uncertainty as well as their anxiety in order to be able to communicate effectively with hosts and then to try to develop accurate predictions and explanations for hosts&#x27; behaviors.
*Assimilation, deviance, and alienation states
**Assimilation and adaptation are not permanent outcomes of the adaptation process; rather, they are temporary outcomes of the communication process between hosts and immigrants. &quot;Alienation or assimilation, therefore, of a group or an individual, is an outcome of the relationship between deviant behavior and neglectful communication.&quot;
*Assimilation
** Assimilation is the process of absorbing the traits of the dominant culture to the point where the group that was assimilated becomes indistinguishable from the host culture. Assimilation can be either forced or done voluntarily depending on situations and conditions. Regardless of the situation or the condition, it is very rare to see a minority group replace and or even forget their previous cultural practices.
*Alienation
** Alienation frequently refers to someone who is ostracized or withdrawn from other people with whom they would ordinarily be expected to associate with. Hajda, a representative theorist and researcher of social alienation says, &quot;alienation is an individuals feeling of uneasiness or discomfort which reflects his exclusion or self-exclusion from social and cultural participation.&quot;

=== Three perspectives on intercultural communication ===
A study on cultural and intercultural communication came up with three perspectives, which are the indigenous approach, cultural approach, and cross-cultural approach.

* Indigenous approach: trying to understand the meaning of different cultures. The process of passing preserved indigenous knowledge and how that is interpreted.
* Cultural approach: similar to the indigenous approach; however, the cultural approach also focuses on the sociocultural context of an individual.
* Cross cultural approaches: focuses on two or more cultures to perceive cross-cultural validity and generalizability.

===Other theories===
* Meaning of meanings theory – &quot;A misunderstanding takes place when people assume a word has a direct connection with its referent. A common past reduces misunderstanding. Definition, metaphor, feedforward, and Basic English are partial linguistic remedies for a lack of shared experience.&quot;
* Face negotiation theory – &quot;Members of collectivistic, high-context cultures have concerns for mutual face and inclusion that lead them to manage conflict with another person by avoiding, obliging, or compromising. Because of concerns for self-face and autonomy, people from individualistic, low-context cultures manage conflict by dominating or through problem solving&quot;.
* Standpoint theory – An individual&#x27;s experiences, knowledge, and communication behaviors are shaped in large part by the social groups to which they belong. Individuals sometimes view things similarly, but other times have very different views in which they see the world. The ways in which they view the world are shaped by the experiences they have and through the social group they identify themselves to be a part of. &quot;Feminist standpoint theory claims that the social groups to which we belong shape what we know and how we communicate.(Wood, 2005) The theory is derived from the Marxist position that economically oppressed classes can access knowledge unavailable to the socially privileged and can generate distinctive accounts, particularly knowledge about social relations.&quot;
* Stranger theory – At least one of the persons in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. Strangers are a &#x27;hyperaware&#x27; of cultural differences and tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individual distinctions.
* Feminist genre theory – Evaluates communication by identifying feminist speakers and reframing their speaking qualities as models for women&#x27;s liberation.
* Genderlect theory – &quot;Male-female conversation is cross-cultural communication. Masculine and feminine styles of discourse are best viewed as two distinct cultural dialects rather than as inferior or superior ways of speaking. Men&#x27;s report talk focuses on status and independence. Women&#x27;s support talk seeks human connection.&quot;
* Cultural critical studies theory – The theory states that the mass media impose the dominant ideology on the rest of society, and the connotations of words and images are fragments of ideology that perform an unwitting service for the ruling elite.
* Marxism – Aims to explain class struggle and the basis of social relations through economics.
== Authentic intercultural communication ==
Authentic intercultural communication is possible. A theory that was found in 1984 and revisited on 1987 explains the importance of truth and intention of getting an understanding. Furthermore, if strategic intent is hidden, there can&#x27;t be any authentic intercultural communication.

In intercultural communication, there could be miscommunication, and the term is called &quot;misfire.&quot; Later on, a theory was founded that has three layers of intercultural communication. The first level is effective communication, second-level miscommunication, and third-level systemically distorted communication. It is difficult to go to the first level due to the speaker&#x27;s position and the structure.

At a practical level, the success of intercultural communication will not be modeled around awareness of and sensitivity to the essentially different behaviors and values of ‘the other culture’, but around the employment of the ability to read culture which derives from underlying universal cultural processes.

==History of assimilation==
Forced assimilation was very common in the European colonial empires the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia.

Voluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.
in reference assimilation developed

== Intercultural competence ==

Intercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness: Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.

*Appropriateness: Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.
*Effectiveness: Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.

Competent communication is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.

===Components===

Intercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others&#x27; avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.

Ethnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one&#x27;s own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.

People must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.

* Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context. This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful.
* Appropriateness: This means that one&#x27;s behaviors are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture.
* Effectiveness: The behaviors that lead to the desired outcome being achieved.
* Motivations: This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one&#x27;s reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one&#x27;s choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one&#x27;s behavior. These two things play a part in motivation.

=== Basic tools for improvement ===

The following are ways to improve communication competence:
* Display of interest: Showing respect and positive regard for the other person.
* Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves and their perception of the world.
* Empathy: Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others
* Task role behavior: Initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities.
* Relational role behavior: Interpersonal harmony and mediation.
* Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort.
* Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways.
* Patience
* Active listening
* Clarity

=== Important factors ===

* Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary.
* Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information.
* Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures.
* Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one&#x27;s own culture.
* Understanding a culture&#x27;s proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning.
*Mutual understanding with the aim of promoting a future of appreciation, robustness and diversity.

=== Traits ===

* Flexibility.
* Tolerating high levels of uncertainty.
* Self-reflection.
* Open-mindedness.
* Sensitivity.
* Adaptability.
* &quot;Thinking outside the box&quot; and lateral thinking

Effective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated varies across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.

The problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.

==Areas of interest==
=== Cross-cultural business strategies ===
Cross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content. The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.

====Management====
Important points to consider:

* Develop cultural sensitivity.
* Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get.
* Careful encoding.
* Use words, pictures, and gestures.
* Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings.
* Selective transmission.
* Build relationships, face-to-face if possible.
* Careful decoding of feedback.
* Get feedback from multiple parties.
* Improve listening and observation skills.
* Follow-up actions.

====Facilitation====
There is a connection between a person&#x27;s personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country&#x27;s environment—including the ability to communicate within that environment.

Two key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extroversion and introversion, and open-mindedness. Resilience, on the other hand, includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.

These factors, combined with the person&#x27;s cultural and racial identity and level of liberalism, comprise that person&#x27;s potential for adaptation.

==== Miscommunication in a Business Setting ====
In a business environment, communication is vital, and there could be many instances where there could be miscommunication. Globalization is a significant factor in intercultural communication and affects business environments. In a business setting, it could be more difficult to communicate due to different ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Due to globalization, more employees have negative emotions in a business environment. The reason why one gets negative feelings is because of miscommunication.

One study done entails the communication between non-native English speaking and native English speaking people in the United States. The study showed that, in a business environment, non-native English speakers and native English speakers had similar experiences in the workplace. Although native English speakers tried to breakdown the miscommunication, non-native English speakers were offended by the terms they used.

=== Cultural Perceptions ===
There are common conceptualizations of attributes that define collectivistic and individualistic cultures. Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.

Manuela Guilherme, a teacher of foreign languages and cultures at secondary schools and university-level courses in Portugal and Great Britain, recognizes a need for a postmodern, decentered critique of Western societies from the point of view of the other in which no one should be regarded as culturally inferior or colonizable. Holliday states their opposition to this approach by discussing their distaste in Guilherme&#x27;s and Byram&#x27;s, a Professor of Education at Durham University, England, orientations towards a clear line between &quot;our culture&quot; and &quot;their culture.&quot;

=== Culture-Based Conflict Situation Models ===
The goal of the original CBSCM proposed by Ting-Toomey and Oetzel (2001) was to use the model as a tentative map to organize and explain the various research concepts in the growing intercultural conflict field. It was based of the culture-based situational model in 2001 and Toomey and Oetzel envisioned that researchers and practitioners could collaborate in an integrative manner and locate concepts and linkage of ideas between the factors and test them in a systematic manner when creating the original CBSCM.

The original CBSCM consists of four components: (1) primary orientation factors (e.g., value patterns and personal attributes), (2) situational and relational boundary features (e.g., in-group-out-group boundary, interpersonal relationship boundary, and conflict goals’ assessment), (3) conflict communication process factors (e.g., conflict styles and facework behaviors), and (4) conflict competence features (e.g., appropriates and effectiveness, productivity and satisfaction).

The integration of the newly revised socioecological framework added by Ting-Toomey and Oetzel (2013) and the original CBSCM results in the revised model. The model still depicts two parties (e.g., people) in conflict with one another and illustrates how the conflict process unfolds. The model is meant to describe the process as continuous and flowing rather than starting at a particular point.

The model is meant to describe the process as continuous and flowing rather than starting at a particular point. It is possible to consider additional conflict parties or entities in the conflict process, yet we are constrained in drawing a model on a single page. The primary orientation factors now include multilevel factors at the macro-, exo-, meso-, and microlevels. The situational appraisals also include multilevel factors at each of these levels.

=== Globalization ===
Globalization plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies. Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers. The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.

The Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, Ph.D. shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells&#x27; Praxis Model.

Sorrells’ process is made up of six points of entry in navigating intercultural spaces, including inquiry, framing, positioning, dialogue, reflection, and action. Inquiry, as the first step of the Intercultural Praxis Model, is an overall interest in learning about and understanding individuals with different cultural backgrounds and world-views, while challenging one&#x27;s own perceptions. Framing, then, is the awareness of “local and global contexts that shape intercultural interactions;” thus, the ability to shift between the micro, meso, and macro frames. Positioning is the consideration of one&#x27;s place in the world compared to others, and how this position might influence both world-views and certain privileges. Dialogue is the turning point of the process during which further understanding of differences and possible tensions develops through experience and engagement with cultures outside of one&#x27;s own. Next, reflection allows for one to learn through introspection the values of those differences, as well as enables action within the world “in meaningful, effective, and responsible ways.&quot; This finally leads to action, which aims to create a more conscious world by working toward social justice and peace among different cultures. As Sorrells argues, “In the context of globalization, [intercultural praxis] … offers us a process of critical, reflective thinking and acting that enables us to navigate … intercultural spaces we inhabit interpersonally, communally, and globally.&quot;

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavors to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as cultural anthropology and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include anthropology, cultural studies, psychology and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by co-cultural populations, i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one&#x27;s own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages&#x27; methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”. It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant. One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication. There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can overgeneralize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations. A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.

== Verbal communication ==
Verbal intercultural communication techniques improve speakers&#x27; or listeners&#x27; capacity for speech production or comprehension. Depending on the communication situation, the plans could either be formal or informal. Verbal communication consists of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.

Factors that affect verbal communication:

* Tone of voice
* Use of descriptive words
* Emphasis on certain phrases
* Volume of voice
* Practice active listening

The way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.

Along with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.

Example of non-verbal cues

* Facial expressions
* Hand gestures
* Use of objects
* Body movement

In terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties. Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.

== Nonverbal communication ==
Nonverbal communication plays a crucial role in interpersonal interactions, conveying emotions, attitudes, and information beyond what words alone can express. According to Burgoon, Guerrero, and Floyd (2016), nonverbal cues such as facial expressions, gestures, posture, and eye contact are essential for understanding the full message in any communication context. These cues often operate on a subconscious level, influencing the dynamics of interactions without explicit awareness from the participants. For instance, consistent eye contact can signal interest and engagement, while crossed arms may indicate defensiveness or discomfort. According to Anthropologist Edward T. Hall, at least 90 percent of all communication is conveyed in a culture&#x27;s nonverbal messages.

Nonverbal communication also varies significantly across cultures, which can lead to misunderstandings in intercultural exchanges if not properly understood. For example, a gesture considered positive in one culture might be offensive in another. Thus, being aware of cultural differences in nonverbal communication can prevent misinterpretations and foster better cross-cultural relationships.

The congruence between verbal and nonverbal messages is critical; discrepancies can lead to perceptions of insincerity or confusion. For instance, if someone says they are happy while displaying a frown, the mixed signals may cause the listener to doubt the sincerity of the verbal message. On the other hand, when verbal and nonverbal cues align, the message is reinforced, and communication becomes more effective.

By integrating nonverbal communication strategies, individuals can enhance their interpersonal effectiveness, making their interactions more meaningful and coherent. Effective nonverbal communication can help in building trust, expressing empathy, and facilitating understanding, thereby improving the quality of personal and professional relationships. This underscores the importance of nonverbal communication in shaping the quality and success of interpersonal relationships. Understanding and effectively using nonverbal communication can significantly enhance the clarity and impact of our messages, making our interactions more authentic and effective.

<text>Al-Muhajiroun (, &quot;The Emigrants&quot;) is a proscribed terrorist network based in Saudi Arabia and active for many years in the United Kingdom. The group was founded by Omar Bakri Muhammad, a Syrian who previously belonged to &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot;; he was not permitted to re-enter Britain after 2005. The organisation has been linked to international terrorism, homophobia, and antisemitism. In its September 2002 conference &quot;The Magnificent 19&quot;, it praised the September 11, 2001 attacks. The network mutates periodically so as to evade the law; it operates under many different aliases.

The group in its original incarnation operated openly in the United Kingdom from 14 January 1986 until the British Government announced an intention ban in August 2005. The group preemptively &quot;disbanded&quot; itself in 2005 to avoid this; two aliases used by the group were proscribed by the British Home Secretary under the Terrorism Act 2006: &quot;Al Ghurabaa&quot; and &quot;The Saviour Sect&quot;. Further proscriptions followed with the Terrorism Act 2000 where &quot;Islam4UK&quot; was proscribed as an &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; alias and &quot;Muslims Against Crusades&quot; followed in 2011. More recent aliases have included &quot;Need4Khilafah&quot; and the &quot;Shariah Project&quot;, proscribed in 2014, just before prominent members, including Anjem Choudary, were sent to prison.

The organisation and its activities have been condemned by larger British Muslim groups such as the Muslim Council of Britain. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; is the most notorious of the domestic Salafi-jihadist groups and its public spokesman Anjem Choudary has significant name recognition; it is considered more radical than its initial parent organisation the &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot;, whose British-based branch does not advocate violence against the United Kingdom and were not proscribed until January 2024. 

Individual members of &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; have been implicated in a number of terrorist attacks, including the murder of Lee Rigby (Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale), the 2017 London Bridge attack (Khuram Butt), and the 2019 London Bridge stabbing (Usman Khan). Some members, such as Zacarias Moussaoui, have been implicated in controversies surrounding &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot;.

It has also operated a Lahore safe house for visiting radicals. Another member, Siddhartha Dhar, became an executioner for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

==Names==
Since they were forced to disband in 2004–2005, &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; network has adopted a variety of different names to try and work around British law; each time their aliases have been subsequently proscribed under the various Terrorism Acts. Typically, the sitting Home Secretary at the time names the specific organisation as proscribed; for example in 2010, Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson named &quot;Islam4UK&quot; in relation to the Wootton Bassett affair. The organisation has used the following names; &quot;Al Ghurabaa&quot; (2004–2006), &quot;The Saved Sect&quot; (2005–2006), &quot;Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah&quot; (2005–2009), &quot;Islam4UK&quot; (2009–2010), &quot;Muslims Against Crusades&quot; (2010–2011) and since then &quot;Need4Khilafah&quot;, the &quot;Shariah Project&quot; and the &quot;Islamic Dawah Association&quot;.

==History==
===Origins in &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot;: 1983–1996===
The network originated in the Middle East, inspired by the life and works of Omar Bakri Muhammad. Born in Aleppo, Syria, to a wealthy Sunni family, during his youth the state was taken over by the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party – Syria Region; it was an organisation which promoted Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, rather than having an Islamic ideology. Although the Ba&#x27;ath Party was nominally secular, and Syria was a majority-Sunni country, many of the ruling Ba&#x27;athists were drawn from the Shia Alawite minority; these included Hafez al-Assad, who became President of Syria in 1971. Some of the religiously inclined Syrian Sunnis, including Omar Bakri, joined the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria; although Bakri was a member during the uprising which led to the 1982 Hama massacre, Bakri himself played no part.

Omar Bakri lived for some time in Beirut, Lebanon. He joined a number of other Islamist organisations while he studied. In Beirut, this included the &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot; (where its founder Taqiuddin al-Nabhani had died in 1977). Omar Bakri then lived in Cairo, Egypt. He moved to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to study at Umm al-Qura University and the Islamic University of Madinah. In the Saudi Kingdom, &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot; was a banned organisation. According to Omar Bakri&#x27;s account of events, by 1983, he had gathered some 38 followers who endorsed creating a Saudi Arabia-based branch of the organisation—but the nearest branch, based in Kuwait, would not allow him to create a branch in Saudi Arabia, and suspended his membership. Subsequently, on 3 March 1983 at Jeddah, he created the group &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot;. That date was &quot;the 59th anniversary of the destruction of the Ottoman Caliphate.&quot; Sadek Hamid, a scholar of Islamic politics, has claimed that this new organisation was just a front for &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot;. While Omar Bakri lived in Saudi Arabia he worked for Eastern Electric (owned by Shamsan and Abdul-Aziz as-Suhaybi), first in Riyadh, and then at its Jeddah branch. In January 1986, &quot;Al-Mahajiroun&quot; was banned in Saudi Arabia and Omar Bakhri was arrested in Jeddah, but he was released on bail and he fled to the United Kingdom. After spending some time in the United States to study, he returned to Britain where he became head of &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain&quot;.

===&quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; in Britain: 1996–2004===
Bakri&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot; ended on 16 January 1996 when he was dismissed by the group&#x27;s global leadership; following this he reinstated &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; in early 1996. In the eyes of the Middle Eastern leadership of &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot;, Omar Bakri had become a liability to their organisation due to various extravagant statements he had made; justifying the assassination of Prime Minister John Major, stating that Queen Elizabeth II would convert to Islam and telling Bosniaks to reject American food aid during the Yugoslav Wars and to &quot;eat Serbs&quot; instead. Omar Bakri Muhammad and his group was the subject of a &quot;Channel 4&quot; documentary entitled the &quot;Tottenham Ayatollah&quot; in 1997, in which Jon Ronson, an investigative journalist of Jewish-background followed Omar Bakri and &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; around for a year. A young Anjem Choudary also featured as the group&#x27;s Deputy. The documentary mentions mainstream Muslim groups (who felt that their activities were leading to a demonisation of all Muslims), Conservative MP Rupert Allason, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and even Hosni Mubarak, President of Egypt criticising the group. The sitting Foreign Secretary in the Conservative Party government; Malcolm Rifkind; responded to international concerns by saying as &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; had not broken any specific laws they could not be prosecuted. Omar Bakri openly discussed living on Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance and the group publicly protested in favour of the Sharia, against homosexuality and other aspects in contemporary British society that it considered to be immoral. The group claimed that they were collecting donations for groups in conflict with the State of Israel, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, but none of these groups have ever confirmed connections or if any money came to them. Yotam Feldner of the &quot;Middle East Media Research Institute&quot;, a pro-Israeli group, cites reports from Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram Weekly&quot; in November 1998, whereby Omar Bakri is alleged to have presented himself as a spokesman for Osama bin Laden&#x27;s &quot;International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders.&quot;
During the 1990s, a number of radical Islamists who were wanted by the authorities in a number of Middle Eastern countries sought refuge in the United Kingdom, particularly London, leading some such as the French intelligence services to ridicule the situation as &quot;Londonistan&quot;. Particularly close to &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; was the Egyptian Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was the imam of Finsbury Park Mosque from 1997 until 2003 (since that time the mosque has been reopened under new authorities who are not affiliated to these tendencies). Abu Hamza had previously been an adviser to the Algerian Armed Islamic Group and had his own group called &quot;Supporters of Shariah&quot; which held joint protests with &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot;. Abu Qatada; who was associated with the Jordanian group &quot;Jaysh Mohammad&quot; and would later write sympathetically about the activities of Osama bin Laden; spoke at a &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; meeting in November 1999 to raise funds for &quot;mujahideen&quot; fighters in Chechnya (as part of the Second Chechen War). Contacts were also maintained between Omar Bakri&#x27;s group and other London exiles who spoke at &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; gatherings; Yassir al-Sirri of Vanguards of Conquest and Mohammad al-Massari of &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot;. In the first two years of its new existence, the group did not advocate violence against the United Kingdom; Omar Bakri claimed in London-newspaper &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot;, this was because he had a &quot;covenant of peace&quot; with the British government when they granted him asylum (though while still part of &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot;, Omar Bakri had earlier made comments in 1991 about a potential assassination of Prime Minister John Major, during the Gulf War). In the early days of New Labour, Home Secretary Jack Straw even appointed &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; activist Makbool Javaid (brother-in-law of future Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan) to a newly formed Race Relations Forum.

This situation changed in September 1998, as seven members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, including Hani al-Sibai, Sayyed Ajami and Sayyed Ahmed Abdel-Maqssuod, were arrested by the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Special Branch as part of &quot;Operation Challenge&quot; for alleged violations of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. This was in the aftermath of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, a joint operation by Egyptian Islamic Jihad and &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; (the two would merge in 2001), killing 224 people. The &quot;Londonistan&quot; situation, as it was known, had long being criticised by some of the leading Arab world governments such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and others, who regarded the groups as a threat to their national security also. After the arrests, Omar Bakri described Britain in &quot;Al-Ahram Weekly&quot; as &quot;the spearhead of blasphemy that seeks to overthrow Muslims and the Islamic caliphate&quot; and claimed that the seven men had been &quot;lulled and betrayed into believing they could seek sanctuary in Britain from their corrupt regimes&quot;, claiming that Britain was motivated by a desire for &quot;future economic favours&quot; from the likes of Saudi Arabia. Six months after the arrests, &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; and others staged a demonstration in front of 10 Downing Street to protest the continued incarceration of the seven men and they, including al-Sibai were eventually released. Tony Blair, who was the Labour Party&#x27;s Prime Minister at the time of the arrests, two decades later in 2017 accused al-Sibai of having radicalised members of the so-called &quot;Beatles&quot; group of ISIS militants, including &quot;Jihadi John&quot; (Mohammed Emwazi) and El Shafee Elsheikh.
In 1998, the so-called &quot;Aden Ten&quot; (including eight British citizens) were arrested, while plotting attacks in Yemen. Omar Bakri boasted of connections, but the men were more directly inspired by Abu Hamza and his idea of Yemen as a starting point for an &quot;Islamic Revolution.&quot; Two years later in 2000, the first British-born suicide bomber Mohammed Bilal Ahmed of Birmingham, blew himself up at an Indian Army barracks in Jammu and Kashmir, killing nine people. Omar Bakri described Ahmed as a student of his. Domestically, on university campuses, Britain&#x27;s National Union of Students banned &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; in March 2001 after complaints were made about literature promoted by the group (particularly pertaining to Jews) and the advertisement of militant camps; Manchester University and the University of Birmingham were flashpoints for this. On an international level, closer attention was placed on Islamist groups following the September 11, 2001 attacks carried out by &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; against the United States and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan which followed to overthrow the Taliban-government which was hosting &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; (the United Kingdom under Blair&#x27;s leadership joined as part of the ISAF). In the immediate aftermath of the start of the War in Afghanistan, &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; spokesman Abdul Rahman Saleem (born Rahman Yahyaei) made statements proclaiming that terrorist attacks against government targets in Britain and even killing the Prime Minister would be legitimate acts.

In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; mostly focused on what they claimed was the injustice of the subsequent invasion of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and often held meetings where the flag of the Taliban; a white flag with the &quot;shahada&quot; in black; was displayed. According to a report &quot;Hope not Hate&quot;, a self-described anti-fascist group closely linked to the British Labour Party, Omar Bakri bragged of connections between &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; and the so-called &quot;Tipton Three&quot; (Ruhal Ahmed, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul), who were arrested in Afghanistan fighting for the Taliban and held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Richard Reid the so-called &quot;Shoe Bomber&quot; during the failed 2001 shoe bomb attempt was radicalised at the AM-linked Finsbury Park Mosque. Aftab Manzoor, Afzal Munir and Mohamed Omar who died in Afghanistan fighting for the Taliban and the Pakistan-based &quot;Harkat-ul-Mujahideen&quot; had AM-connections. Indeed, &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; maintained a safehouse in Lahore for visiting radicals fighting for the Taliban. The most explicit connection between AM and the 9/11 attacks itself was Zacarias Moussaoui who was radicalised by the group in Brixton during the 1990s; Moussaoui pled guilty to conspiring to carry out the attacks, but was in prison in Minnesota at the time that they were carried out (he was subsequently incarcerated at ADX Florence). On 11 September 2002, Abu Hamza along with &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; held a conference which came to be known as the &quot;Magnificent 19&quot; meeting (a term referring to the hijackers). Promoted as the launching of the &quot;Islamic Council of Britain&quot; (a name chosen deliberately to cause public confusion with the mainstream Muslim Council of Britain), supposedly to advocate for sharia law, the conference at Finsbury Park Mosque was entitled &quot;September the 11th 2001: A Towering Day in History&quot; and posters, showing an image of planes crashing into the World Trade Center were put up in Stepney, Blackburn and Birmingham. Omar Bakri said that attendees &quot;look at September 11 like a battle, as a great achievement by the &quot;mujahideen&quot; against the evil superpower. I never praised September 11 after it happened but now I can see why they did it&quot; and described Osama bin Laden and &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; as &quot;sincere [and] devoted people who stood firm against the invasion of a Muslim country.&quot; Anjem Choudary, Omar Bakri&#x27;s deputy and a spokesman for &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; also attended.

===&quot;Disbandment&quot;, early aliases: 2004–2009===
In early 2002, the Metropolitan Police made a number of arrests in regards to the Wood Green ricin plot, an alleged Islamist bioterrorism plot using the poison ricin (derived from seeds of the castor oil plant) by immigrants of Algerian-origin against the London Underground. Later the same month, during a raid on a flat in Crumpsall, north Manchester, DC Stephen Oake was murdered with a kitchen knife by Kamel Bourgass, an illegal immigrant from Algeria. Bourgass also stabbed three other members of Greater Manchester Police. He was wanted in connection to the Wood Green ricin plot, but was not immediately recognised. Bourgass had attended meetings of &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; leading up to the incident and in the aftermath, six days later Finsbury Park Mosque was raided. The nature of the plot itself was controversial, no purified ricin was found, though notes and castor oil seeds were and most of the people arrested were eventually released. The only person ultimately convicted in court in 2005 in relation to the ricin plot was Bourgass, this was largely due to having notes in his possession on how to make ricin, cyanide and botulinum. Nevertheless, Colin Powell in his February 2003 presentation to the United Nations, arguing for commissioning the Iraq War based on alleged connections between Saddam Hussein and &quot;al-Qaeda&quot;, made reference to a &quot;UK Poison Cell&quot; as part of an international network.

Two brothers from Manchester, Adeel Shahid and Sajeel Shahid opened a branch of &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; in Pakistan and ran a &quot;safehouse&quot; in Lahore for Islamists from the West (including the United Kingdom) to back the Taliban and &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; against ISAF forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. One of the more notable individuals whom Omar Bakri and Sajeel Shahid enabled to travel to Pakistan was Mohammed Junaid Babar, who intended to go to Peshawar, but ended up in Lahore. While in Pakistan, Mohammed Junaid Babar came into contact with Mohammad Sidique Khan who would later plan the 7 July 2005 London bombings. These activities of the organisation in Pakistan were controversial to the government there, due to Islamists hostility to sitting President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf. A speaker at one of the same meetings as Sajeel Shahid was former Major-General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, who had previously been involved in a coup against the government of Pakistan. Back in Britain, things came to a head for &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; in March 2004, with the launching of &quot;Operation Crevice&quot; by the Metropolitan Police. A number of the men arrested and later convicted (Omar Khyam, Salahuddin Amin, Jawad Akbar, Anthony Garcia and Waheed Mahmood) had associations with &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot;; 1300 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertiliser was also recovered and the men, mostly of Pakistani-origin, were accused of planning bombing attacks on shopping centres, night clubs and gas works in Britain. Mohammed Junaid Babar testified as a witness against his former associates.

Al Muhajiroun disbanded on 13 October 2004 to avoid proscription. However, it was believed that The Saviour Sect was to all intents and purposes Al Muhajiroun operating under a new name. Shortly after the 7 July 2005 London bombings Tony Blair announced the group would be banned as part of a series of measures against condoning or glorifying terrorism. Just days after the 7 July 2005 London bombings the Oxford-based Malaysian jurist, Shaykh Muhammad Afifi al-Akiti, issued his landmark fatwa against suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians, titled &quot;Defending the Transgressed, by Censuring the Reckless against the Killing of Civilians&quot;, which was written in response to this controversial &quot;Magnificent 19&quot; statement made by Al-Muhajiroun.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke banned Omar Bakri Muhammad from the United Kingdom on 12 August 2005 on the grounds that his presence was &quot;not conducive to the public good.&quot; Two other offshoot organisations, The Saviour Sect and Al Ghurabaa had previously been banned for the &#x27;glorification&#x27; of terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2006.

The organisation was then re-founded as the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jammah on 18 November 2005, in north London by Sulayman Keeler. He called Queen Elizabeth II an enemy of Islam and Muslims. In February 2006, ASWJ helped organize the Islamist demonstration outside Danish Embassy in London in 2006.

In December 2006, ASWJ issued a call on one of its websites for Muslims to fight the Ethiopian attack against the Islamic Courts Union in Somalia &quot;financially, physically and verbally&quot;. On 10 March 2009, ASWJ demonstrated in the town to protest against the Royal Anglian Regiment&#x27;s homecoming parade following the latter&#x27;s posting in Afghanistan. The demonstration was a deliberately provocative publicity stunt, and had been disowned by representatives from Luton&#x27;s Islamic communities. The protest, although small, attracted media attention, generating anger that the authorities had given the demonstration permission and police protection.

===Islam4UK and Wootton Bassett: 2009–2010===

The group was then relaunched in 2009 under the alias &quot;Islam4UK&quot;, described itself as having &quot;been established by sincere Muslims as a platform to propagate the supreme Islamic ideology within the United Kingdom as a divine alternative to man-made law&quot; to &quot;convince the British public about the superiority of Islam, thereby changing public opinion in favour of Islam in order to transfer the authority and power to the Muslims in order to implement the Sharia (in Britain)&quot;. It was led by Anjem Choudary.

A demonstration it made against returning British soldiers in Luton gained media attention and led to the formation of the English Defence League (EDL). 
On 16 October 2009, members of the organisation protested against the visit to Britain by Dutch MP Geert Wilders. They carried banners with slogans such as &quot;Shariah is the solution, freedom go to hell&quot; and &quot;Geert Wilders deserves Islamic punishment&quot;.

In January 2010 the group gained widespread media attention by announcing plans to hold a protest march through Wootton Bassett; an English town where unofficial public mourning takes place for corteges of armed forces personnel killed on active service, as they make their way from RAF Lyneham to Oxford. Reports that the group planned to carry empty coffins to &quot;represent the thousands of Muslims who have died&quot; were denied by the group, although the empty coffins had been proposed by Choudary himself. Choudary said that the event would be peaceful, and that it was not timed to coincide with any mourning processions. The announcement was condemned by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who said that plans for the march were &quot;disgusting&quot; and that &quot;to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be completely inappropriate&quot;. The Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, indicated he would agree to any request from the Wiltshire Police or local government to ban the march under Section 13 of the Public Order Act 1986. Choudary said he chose Wootton Bassett to attract maximum attention and, he asserted, 500 members of Islam4UK would carry &#x27;symbolic coffins&#x27; in memory of the Muslim civilians &#x27;murdered by merciless&#x27; coalition forces.

The Muslim Council of Britain stated that it &quot;condemns the call by...Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett&quot;, and continues, &quot;Like other Britons, Muslims are not opposed to Britain’s Armed Forces.&quot; The Wiltshire Islamic Cultural Centre stated &quot;We, along with all other Muslim community groups in Wiltshire and the surrounding area, including Bath Islamic Society and Swindon Thamesdown Islamic Association, unreservedly condemn this march,&quot; adding, &quot;Therefore we are putting the record straight and letting the media and general public know that the vast majority of Muslims have nothing to do with this group&quot;, and asking that Wiltshire Police ban the march. They stated that they, along with Call to Islam Centre and Masjid Al-Ghurabah, would counter-demonstrate against &quot;Islam4UK/Al-Muhajiroon&quot;. On 10 January 2010 Islam4UK said it was cancelling its planned march in Wootton Bassett; however, the police had not actually received a request for permission for the march.

Islam4UK was listed as an alias of Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect, already proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2004, by an order on 14 January 2010. In announcing the proscription, the then British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said: &quot;It is already proscribed under two other names – Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect&quot;.

In the January 2010 order and a November 2011 order, the names Al Muhajiroun, Call to Submission, Islamic Path, London School of Sharia and Muslims Against Crusades were also listed as aliases. In June 2014, Need4Khilafah, the Shariah Project and the Islamic Dawah Association were added to the list. Note that the order is not needed to establish an alias as identical to another name of a proscribed organization, it is enough that the two are to all intents and purposes the same, and that the individual prosecuted has performed a proscribed act.

Islam4UK issued a statement saying, &quot;Today&#x27;s ban is another nail in the coffin of capitalism and another sign of the revival of Islam and Muslims.&quot; They restated their goal: &quot;Therefore, we will one day liberate our land from occupation and implement the Shariah not just in Muslim countries but also right here in Great Britain. This is something that we believe in, live by and hope that in our lifetime we will witness&quot;. In a further statement, issued on the same day via their website, they stated that &quot;Islam4UK has been contacted by authorities to (force) shut down its operations, we stress this domain name will no longer be used by us, but the struggle for Khilafah (aka &quot;the Caliphate&quot;) will continue regardless of what the disbelievers plot against the Muslims. It is the duty of all Muslims to rise up and call for the Khilafah wherever they may be&quot;. The ban has led some (&quot;the left&quot;, according to Sunny Hundal writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;) to criticise it as a &quot;blow to free expression&quot;, which will &quot;serve to undermine the government’s effort to prevent violent extremism&quot;. Deborah Orr has commented in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the ban &quot;erodes democratic rights with the intention of defending them&quot;.

===Muslims Against Crusades: 2010–2011===
The network re-emerged as &quot;Muslims Against Crusades&quot; (abbreviated &quot;MAC&quot;), notionally under Abu Assadullah in 2010, featuring members of Islam4UK after their banning such as boxer Anthony Small and Anjem Choudary. Muslims Against Crusades maintained that Muslims are not &quot;obliged to obey the law of the land in whatever country they reside&quot;. In 2011 the group proposed that Muslims should set up independent emirates in select cities in the UK, operating under sharia (Islamic law) entirely outside British law. The group suggested the towns of Bradford, Dewsbury, and Tower Hamlets in the East End of London as the possible first test beds for these entities. The group has often clashed with the English Defence League. Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group from midnight on 11 November 2011, making membership or support of the group a criminal offence. The group was denounced by the Muslim Council of Britain, who described MAC as &quot;a tiny, and utterly deplorable, extremist group&quot;. Many former MAC activists are currently active in Islamist groups known as &#x27;Millatu Ibrahim&#x27; and the &#x27;Tawheed Movement.&#x27;
MAC engaged in a number of incidents including protests outside the Royal Albert Hall and in Kensington on 11 November 2010, when two large plastic poppies were burned during the Remembrance Day silence. A 2010 Remembrance Day ceremony in London was disrupted by members of the organization, who were protesting against British Army actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. They burnt large poppies and chanted &quot;British soldiers burn in hell&quot; during the two-minute silence. Two of the men were arrested and charged for threatening behavior. One was convicted and fined £50. The same group planned to hold another protest in 2011 named &quot;Hell for Heroes&quot;, declaring that soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve to go to hell. The group was banned by the Home Secretary the day before the planned protest.
Throughout 2010 and 2011 there were various protests against the imprisonment of Muslims, with calls for their release; and calls for a withdrawal of non-Muslim forces from Muslim countries. There was a protest against pastor Terry Jones when he burnt a Quran (the holy book of Islam) in Florida, US on 20 March 2011.

They applied to the police to stage a demonstration in London to disrupt the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011, but this was not allowed. They later cancelled their protest due to a &quot;possible danger to life&quot;

On 2 May 2011 Osama bin Laden, who had led the Islamist al-Qaeda organization responsible for violent attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, was killed in Pakistan by US forces. On 7 May hundreds of UK Muslims and MAC members held a rally and Salat al-Janazah (funeral prayer) for him outside the US embassy in London. When protesters tried to storm the embassy there were clashes with police. Anjem Choudary, who organised the protest, warned of an attack similar to the 7 July 2005 London bombings in response to Bin Laden&#x27;s death.

On 30 July around 50 members of MAC and Waltham Forest Muslims marched for two hours from Leyton tube station to Walthamstow town square calling for democracy to be replaced by sharia law and chanted slogans such as &#x27;democracy—hypocrisy&#x27;, &#x27;Sharia for UK&#x27; and &#x27;Secularism go to hell&#x27;. In August, members of Muslims Against Crusades held a demonstration denouncing the Shia denomination and &quot;anti-Islamic&quot; Shia regimes of Syria and Iran. To mark the tenth anniversary of 11 September attacks, around 100 men linked to the group protested outside the US embassy in London, burning US flags and chanting through megaphones. The protest could be heard by mourners in 11 September Memorial Garden nearby, where a minute&#x27;s silence was being observed to mark the first aeroplane hitting the World Trade Centre in New York City.

On 10 November 2011 British Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group after it planned to repeat the poppy-burning demonstration; membership of Muslims Against Crusades became illegal at midnight. On 2 December 2011 twenty people were arrested on suspicion of being members of a banned group, and two for obstruction and violent disorder at a demonstration outside the US embassy in London; the police did not confirm a report that the protesters were members of MAC. The group was ridiculed on the television program &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, with Ian Hislop saying &quot;aren&#x27;t they a couple hundred years late, these Muslims Against Crusades?&quot;

===Need4Khilafah and recent: 2011–present===

In June 2014, the UK government banned three more groups it suspected of being aliases for the extremist organisation al-Muhajiroun:

* Need4Khilafah
* the Shariah Project
* the Islamic Dawah Association

==Ideology==
Al-Muhajiroun&#x27;s proclaimed aims are to establish public awareness about Islam, to influence public opinion in favour of the sharia, to convince members of society that Islam is inherently political and a viable ideological alternative, to unite Muslims on a global scale in the threats facing the Ummah and to resume the Islamic way of life by re-establishing the Islamic Caliphate. Members have carried out numerous murders and terrorist attacks. Their general worldview; with a heavy focus on a pan-Islamist-orientated worldwide caliphate is derived directly from its parent organisation &quot;Hizb al-Tahrir&quot; (founded by Taqiuddin al-Nabhani) as espoused by Omar Bakri Muhammad. The organisation is commonly described as Islamist and is sometimes classified as Salafist, however, some Salafists (who follow the line of Rabee al-Madkhali and other Salafists mainstream in the Arab Gulf states), consider &quot;Al-Muhajiroun&quot; and other modern &quot;jihadist&quot; groups which focus on politically motivated terrorism (particularly indiscriminate attacks against civilians) as modern day Kharajites, whose ideological line derives ultimately from the Muslim Brotherhood and Sayyid Qutb (supposedly influenced by non-Islamic &quot;Leninist&quot; ideas, these individuals, in their view &quot;appropriated&quot; the Salafi name for means of credibility within Islamic circles), rather than Ibn Taymiyyah.

==Terrorism==

===Statements===
Aside from declaring the 9/11 hijackers &quot;the Magnificent 19&quot;, controversial statements made by al-Muhajiroun include one warning the British government that it was &quot;sitting on a box of dynamite and have only themselves to blame if after attacking the Islamic movements and the Islamic scholars, it all blows up in their face&quot;.

In 2004 BBC Newsnight quoted one Al-Muhajiroun leader, Abu Ibrahim, as saying,
When they speak about 11 September, when the two planes magnificently run through those buildings, OK and people turn around and say, &#x27;hang on a second, that is barbaric. Why did you have to do that?&#x27; You know why? Because of ignorance. ... For us it&#x27;s retaliation. Islam is not the starter of wars. If you start the war we won&#x27;t turn the other cheek. ... According to you it can&#x27;t be right. According to Islam it&#x27;s right. When you talk about innocent civilians, do you not kill innocent civilians in Iraq?

===Attacks===
On 29 April 2003, Asif Hanif and Omar Sharif, who attended some of Al-Muhajiroun&#x27;s circles, carried out a bombing of a café in Tel Aviv, Israel, that killed three people and injured 60 others.
In 2006, another individual connected with Al-Muhajiroun allegedly detonated a bomb in India, killing himself and destroying an army barracks.

In 2007, five young Muslims with Al-Muhajiroun connections – Omar Khyam, Waheed Mahmood, Anthony Garcia, Jawad Akbar and Saladhuddin Amin – were convicted of a multiple bombing plot to use fertiliser bombs &quot;which police say could have killed hundreds of British people. The men were caught after police and MI5 launched a massive surveillance operation.&quot; The surveillance culminated in a raid called Operation Crevice. The targets included &quot;the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London and Britain&#x27;s domestic gas network.&quot; According to Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies:
The fertiliser bomb trial has given us the smoking-gun evidence that groups like al-Muhajiroun have had an important part in radicalising young British Muslims, and that this can create terrorists.

On 22 May 2013, the murder of Lee Rigby was carried out by two members of Al-Muhajiroun, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. From about 2003, Adebolajo was corrupted by Bakri and then by Choudary, after Bakri left the country in August 2005. One former associate said Adebolajo that &quot;locked himself in this room with this bloke for a few hours and when he came out he was a Muslim convert. He was spouting all kinds of stuff and said he had changed his name.&quot; Adebolajo insisted to be called during the Rigby trial &quot;Mujahid&quot;.

At least one of the perpetrators of the 2017 London Bridge attack, Khuram Butt, was a member.

The 2019 London Bridge stabbing, carried out on 29 November by Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist, resulted in the death of two civilians and the wounding of three others. Khan was shot dead by police; he was a supporter of Al-Muhajiroun.

==2019 weapons depot==
In 2019, a storage of weapons linked to al-Muhajiroun was found in Coventry. It included a sniper rifle and tracer rounds.

<text>The history of Toulouse, in Occitania, southern France, traces back to ancient times. After Roman rule, the city was ruled by the Visigoths and 
Merovingian and Carolingian Franks. Capital of the County of Toulouse during the Middle Ages, today it is the capital of the Midi-Pyrénées region.

== Before 118 BC: pre-Roman times ==
Archaeological evidence dates human settlement in Toulouse to the 8th century BC. Its location was advantageous; the Garonne River bends westward toward the Atlantic Ocean, and can be crossed easily. People settled on the hills overlooking the river, in the modern locality of Vieille-Toulouse (literally &quot;Old-Toulouse&quot;), south of present downtown Toulouse. Just north of the hills is a large plain suitable for agriculture, and the site was a center for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The historical name of the city, Tolosa (Τολῶσσα in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), researchers agree that it was probably Aquitanian (an ancestor of the Basque language), its meaning is unknown. Toulouse&#x27;s name has remained almost unchanged through the centuries (rare for a French city), despite Celtic, Roman and Germanic invasions.

The first inhabitants were apparently the Aquitani, of whom little is known. Later came Iberians from the south, who (like the Aquitani) were non-Indo-Europeans. During the third century BC the Volcae Tectosages (a Gallic tribe from Belgium or southern Germany) arrived, the first Indo-Europeans in the region. They settled in Tolosa, intermarrying with the local people, and their Gaulish language became predominant. By 200 BC, Tolosa is attested on coins as the capital of the Volcae Tectosages (which Julius Caesar called Tolosates—singular Tolosas—in his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;). According to archaeologists, Tolosa was one of the wealthiest and most important cities in Gaul during the pre-Roman era. Gold and silver mines were nearby, and offerings to its shrines and temples accumulated wealth in the city.

==118 BC–AD 418: Roman period==

The Romans began their conquest of southern Gaul (later known as the Provincia) in 125 BC. In 118 BC they founded the colony of Narbo Martius (Narbonne, the Mediterranean city nearest to inland Toulouse) and made contact with the Tolosates, noted for their wealth and the position of their capital for trade with the Atlantic. Tolosa allied with the Romans, who established a fort on the plain north of the city (a key position near the border of independent Aquitania) but otherwise left Tolosa semi-independent.

In 109 BC the Germanic Cimbri tribe descended the Rhône Valley, invaded the Provincia and defeated the Romans, whose power was shaken along the recently conquered Mediterranean coast. The Tolosates rebelled against Rome, killing the Roman garrison, before Rome recovered and defeated the invaders. In 106 BC, Quintus Servilius Caepio was sent to reconquer and punish Tolosa. With the aid of Tolosates who remained loyal to Rome, he captured the city and the wealth of its temples and shrines.

Tolosa was then incorporated into the Roman Provincia (Provincia Romana, the common name for the province of Transalpine Gaul with its capital at Narbo Martius). Although Tolosa was an important military garrison at the western border of the Roman empire, the city remained a backwater in the Provincia and people still lived in the old Celtic city in the hills. No Roman colony was established, and few soldiers settled in the area.

After the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar, Tolosa did not participate in the uprisings against Rome during the Gallic wars and southern France would be the most Romanized part of France after the decline of the Roman Empire. Caesar established his camp on the Tolosa plain in 52 BC, conquering western Aquitania. With the conquest of Aquitania and Gaul, Tolosa was no longer a military outpost. Capitalizing on its position for trade between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (both now under Roman control), the city grew rapidly.

The most important event in the city&#x27;s history was the decision to relocate north of the hills. A typical Roman city, with straight streets, was founded on the plain on the beginning bank of the river between the end of Augustus&#x27; reign and the beginning of Tiberius&#x27; (about 10–30 AD). The population was forced to relocate to the new city (also named Tolosa), and the old settlement was abandoned. Walls were built around the new city, probably at the initiative of Emperor Augustus (who wanted to create a major city at the junction of the newly built Via Aquitania and the Garonne); such walls, unnecessary during the Pax Romana, were built as an imperial favor to indicate a city&#x27;s status. Until the fall of Rome, the new Tolosa was a &quot;civitas&quot; of the province of Gallia Narbonensis (with its capital Narbo Martius—Narbonne—the new name of the old &quot;provincia&quot;).

With imperial favor and thriving trade, Tolosa became a major city in the Roman Empire. During the civil war following Nero&#x27;s death, Tolosa native M. Antonius Primus led the armies of Vespasian into Italy, entered Rome in 69 AD and established the Flavian dynasty. Emperor Domitian, son of Vespasian and Primus&#x27; friend, granted Tolosa the honorific status of Roman colony. Another sign of imperial favor was Domitian&#x27;s bestowal of the title of Palladia on the city in reference to Pallas Athena, goddess of arts and knowledge.

&quot;Palladia Tolosa&quot; was a major Roman city, with aqueducts, circus and theaters, thermae, a forum and an extensive sewage system. Protected by its walls and its distance from the Rhine, it escaped unscathed from the third-century invasions. With much of Gaul destroyed, Toulouse was the fourth-largest city in the western half of the Roman Empire after Rome, Treves and Arles. Around that time, Christianity entered the city; the Christian community expanded under Saint Saturnin (locally known as Saint Sernin), the first bishop of Toulouse, who was martyred in Toulouse about 250. In 313 the Edict of Milan established religious freedom in the empire, ending persecution of the Christians, and in 403 the Saint-Sernin basilica opened as a shrine for relics of Saint Saturnin.

On 31 December 406 the Rhine frontier was breached by tribes seeking to escape starvation during a harsh winter. In 407, Toulouse was besieged by the Vandals. Under its bishop, Saint Exuperius, the city resisted; the Vandals lifted the siege, moving into Spain and settling in North Africa. &quot;The provinces of Aquitaine and of the Novempopulana (Gascony), of Lyon and of Narbonne are, with the exception of a few cities, one universal scene of desolation. And those which the sword spares without, famine ravages within. I cannot speak without tears of Toulouse which has been kept from failing hitherto by the merits of its reverend bishop Exuperius&quot;, wrote Jerome to a Roman widow in 409 (&quot;Letters&quot; cxxiii.16). In 413 (three years after they sacked Rome), the Visigoths under King Ataulf captured Toulouse; under pressure from Roman forces, they soon withdrew south of the Pyrenees. After the murder of Ataulf, his successor Wallia resolved to make peace with Rome. In exchange for peace, in 418 Emperor Honorius gave the Visigoths Aquitania and Toulouse (in Gallia Narbonensis, at the border of Aquitania). The Visigoths chose Palladia Tolosa as their capital, ending Roman rule of the city.

==418–508: Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse==

The Visigothic kings of Toulouse, one of the &quot;foederati&quot; (allies) of the Roman Empire in the West and limited to Aquitania and Toulouse, soon began encroaching on neighboring territories. As Roman allies the Visigoths helped defeat Germanic invaders in Spain (notably the Suebi), taking advantage of their position to expand their territory south of the Pyrenees. They tried to conquer the Mediterranean coast of the province of Gallia Narbonensis, but were opposed by Rome. In 439 the Roman general Litorius defeated the Visigoths at Narbonne, driving them back to Toulouse. Although he besieged the city, he was defeated and taken prisoner. Avitus, the praetorian prefect of Gaul with influence on King Theodoric I of the Visigoths, was then sent to Toulouse and concluded a peace. In 451, threatened by an invasion of the Huns in Gaul, he negotiated a treaty between Rome and the Visigoths and they defeated the Huns. In 455 Avitus, &quot;magister militum&quot; (senior military officer of the Empire) on a diplomatic mission to King Theodoric II of the Visigoths, was proclaimed the new Roman emperor in Toulouse by his Visigothic friends amid news that the Vandals had sacked Rome and Emperor Petronius Maximus had been murdered. Avitus&#x27; reign in Rome was brief, and he was defeated by his enemies in 456. This antagonized the Visigoths, who warred with the new Roman leaders, and a weaker Rome gave way. The Narbonne region was conquered by the Visigoths in 462.

King Euric (466–484), an enemy of Rome, extended the Visigothic territory in Gaul and Spain. In 475 he dissolved the treaty with Rome, proclaiming independence a year before the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Toulouse was now the capital of an expanding Gothic kingdom; by the end of the fifth century, the kingdom of Toulouse extended from the Loire Valley in the north to the Strait of Gibraltar in the south and from the Rhône in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west (the largest territory controlled from Toulouse).
Unlike most cities in western Europe, Toulouse remained prosperous during the Migration Period. Although the Visigoths professed Arianism (a non-Trinitarian form of Christianity) and lived apart from their Gallo-Roman subjects, they were generally well accepted for bringing protection and prosperity. Behind its first-century walls, the city encompassed the same area; most western European cities were hastily enclosing small portions of their imperial area. The treasure which the Visigoths seized in Rome in 410 (including that from the Temple in Jerusalem) was reportedly stored in Toulouse at the time. The Visigoths blended Roman and Gothic cultures, preserving Roman law in the 506 Breviary of Alaric (applying to the Visigoths and the local Roman population). The Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse was reportedly more Romanized and its state structure more elaborate than the Frankish kingdom north of the Loire Valley.

Under Clovis the Franks converted to Catholicism, receiving support from bishops opposing the Visigoths&#x27; Arianism and marching south to the northern borders of the Visigothic kingdom. War followed, and the Visigothic king Alaric II was defeated by Clovis at the Battle of Vouillé in 507. The Franks moved south, conquered Aquitania and captured Toulouse in 508. The Visigoths withdrew to Iberia, moving their capital to Toledo. Toulouse became part of Aquitaine, a smaller city in the Frankish kingdom.

== 508–768: Merovingian Franks and the duchy of Aquitaine ==
After the Frankish conquest, Toulouse began a period of decline and anarchy. Poor weather, plagues, demographic collapse and the decline of education and culture were common in the Frankish lands during the sixth and seventh centuries. Following Clovis&#x27; death in 511, Aquitaine and the rest of the kingdom were divided between his sons (the Merovingian dynasty). The Merovingian kings fought each other for control of the Frankish realm. Aquitaine was loosely controlled by Frankish kings, who delegated dukes to control the region in their name. In 680, the Duchy of Vasconia (founded 602) and Aquitaine merged under the first independent duke of Aquitaine: Felix, a Roman patrician from Toulouse. The Merovingian monarchy was weakened, and an independent local dynasty of dukes emerged in Aquitaine. Unrecognized by the Merovingians, they ruled as kings in Aquitaine (including the Basque-speaking area of Gascony south of the Garonne) with their capital Toulouse.
During the early eighth century the Arabs appeared in the region from the Mediterranean coast of Spain, capturing Narbonne from the last Visigoths in 719. Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, &quot;wali&quot; (governor) of al-Andalus (Muslim Spain), mustered a strong army from North Africa, Syria and Yemen to conquer Aquitaine. Moving west from Narbonne, he besieged Toulouse. After three months, as the city was about to surrender, Duke Odo of Aquitaine (also known as Eudes)—who had left the city to find help—returned with an army and defeated the Arabs in the Battle of Toulouse on 9 June 721. Charles Martel refused to help, wishing to take advantage of the situation to recover Aquitaine, and Odo led an army of Aquitanians and Franks to fight the Arabs. The Battle of Toulouse was a crushing defeat for the Arabs; the army scattered, most of the soldiers were killed, al-Samh died of his wounds and the remainder of the Arab troops (under Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi) fled back to Narbonne. It is noted by Arab historians as the major check of Arab westward expansion.

Before 730 Odo allied with the Muslim ruler of Catalonia, Uthman ibn Naissa (also known as Munuza). The greatest threat to Duke Odo was his Frankish neighbor in the north. Odo married his daughter to Munuza and Arab raids in Aquitaine temporarily ended, enabling him to focus on the northern threat. In 731 Munuza rebelled against the new &quot;wali&quot; of al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi. Abd al-Rahman defeated him, and to punish Odo for his alliance he launched a raid on Aquitaine. Remembering the Battle of Toulouse, he crossed the Pyrenees west the city and defeated Odo&#x27;s army in Bordeaux. With Bordeaux captured, the Arabs moved north towards the sacred Frankish abbey of Tours. Odo requested Frankish help; Charles Martel, leader of the Franks, mustered an army and met the Arabs near Poitiers. On 25 October 732, at the Battle of Poitiers, the Arabs were defeated and Abd al-Rahman died on the field. The scholars of Charlemagne, grandson of Charles Martel, extensively chronicled the battle.

After the Battle of Poitiers, Odo was obligated to pay homage to Charles Martel and recognize Frankish authority. The Franks were busy in Burgundy and did not move further south, leaving Odo independent until his death in 735. He was succeeded by his son, Duke Hunald I of Aquitaine (also known as Hunold and Hunaud). Hunald refused to recognize Charles Martel, who sent his troops south and captured Bordeaux in 736. Hunald was forced to accept Frankish authority, and Martel withdrew his troops from Aquitaine to attack Arab holdings on the Mediterranean coast near Narbonne. In 741 Charles Martel died and was succeeded by his son, Pippin the Short (&quot;Pépin le Bref&quot;). Hunald again rebelled against Frankish authority the following year; after his 745 defeat, he retired to a monastery. He was succeeded by his son, Waifer of Aquitaine (also known as Waifre and Gaifier). Pippin, busy at home and sharing power with his brother, left Waifer in possession of Aquitaine and became sole ruler of the Frankish realm in 747. In 751 he deposed the last Merovingian king and was elected king of the Franks with the support of the pope, founding the Carolingian dynasty.

In 752, Pippin resumed the conquest of Arab territories on the Mediterranean coast where his father had failed. Facing local resistance, including intervention by Duke Waifer, in 759 he captured Narbonne and ended Arab rule north of the Pyrenees. Aquitaine was now surrounded by the Frankish kingdom, and in 760 Pippin began its conquest. It took the Franks eight years to subdue Aquitaine, Toulouse and Gascony; in 768, the last pockets of resistance crumbled as Duke Waifer was betrayed and murdered under mysterious circumstances. Although Aquitaine was destroyed after eight years of scorched-earth tactics by Pippin and Waifer, the region would recover under Charlemagne.

== 768–877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine ==
Toulouse, Aquitaine and Gascony were again part of the Frankish kingdom. After his victory, Pippin the Short died in 768 and was succeeded by his sons Charlemagne and Carloman. At Pippin&#x27;s death, Hunald (son of Duke Waifer) staged an insurrection against Frankish power in Aquitaine. Charlemagne intervened, defeating him. In 771 Carloman died, leaving Charlemagne sole ruler of the Frankish realm. In 778, Charlemagne led his army into Spain against the Arabs. On his way back, in Roncesvalles, Charlemagne&#x27;s rear guard was attacked in the pass by Basque warriors. Realizing that the local populations were not entirely loyal to the Franks, he reorganized the region&#x27;s administration; direct Frankish government was instituted, and Frankish counts (deputies of the Frankish king) were appointed in cities such as Toulouse.

In 781 Charlemagne established the Kingdom of Aquitaine, comprising Aquitaine, Gascony and the Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to Nîmes (known as Gothia), and gave the crown of Aquitaine to his three-year-old son Louis. Similar kingdoms were established in Bavaria and Lombardy to ensure the loyalty of local populations. Crowns were also given to Charlemagne&#x27;s other sons, and Aquitaine was known for its independence and wealth.

Charlemagne saw that he could not trust the local nobility of Vasconia, appointing Frankish counts and creating counties (such as Fezensac) which could fight regional dukes such as Lupus. Oversight of this Basque frontier seems to have been given to Chorson, count (or duke) of Toulouse. In 787 (or 789) Chorson was captured by Odalric the Basque (probably Lupus&#x27; son), who forced him into an agreement. Charlemagne replaced him with Count William in 790.

Charlemagne&#x27;s reign saw the recovery of western Europe from the preceding dark age. Toulouse was a major Carolingian military stronghold against Muslim Spain, with military campaigns launched from the city nearly every year of Charlemagne&#x27;s reign. In 801, Barcelona and a large part of Catalonia were conquered. With the northern areas of Aragon and Navarre in the Pyrenees, the region became the southern (Spanish March) of the Frankish empire.

In 814, Charlemagne died. His only surviving son was Louis, king of Aquitaine, who became Emperor Louis the Pious. The kingdom of Aquitaine was transferred to Pippin, Louis&#x27; second son. Gothia was detached from Aquitaine and administered directly by the emperor, recreating the former duchy of Aquitaine. Louis had three sons, and in 817 he arranged an allocation of shares in their future inheritance. Pippin was confirmed king of Aquitaine, Louis the German was made king in Bavaria and eldest son Lothar became co-emperor (with future authority over his brothers).

In 823 Charles the Bald, Louis the Pious&#x27; son with his second wife, was born and she wished to place her son in the line of succession. Strife between his three older sons and Louis and his new wife led to the gradual collapse of the Frankish empire. In 838 Pippin I of Aquitaine died, and Louis the Pious and his wife installed Charles the Bald as king of Aquitaine. At the 839 Assembly of Worms, the empire was re-divided. Charles the Bald received the western part of the empire, Lothar the central and eastern part and Louis the German Bavaria. Pippin II of Aquitaine, son of Pippin I who was recognized as king by the Aquitanians (but not the Basques, whose Vasconia had seceded from Aquitaine), and Louis the German opposed the partitions.

Louis the Pious died in 840, Lothar claimed the empire and war broke out. Originally allied with his nephew Pippin II, Louis the German allied with his half-brother Charles the Bald and they defeated Lothar. In August 843, they signed the Treaty of Verdun. The empire was divided into three parts. Charles the Bald received the western part, &quot;Francia Occidentalis&quot; (Western Frankland, soon called France); Louis the German the eastern part, &quot;Francia Orientalis&quot; (Eastern Frankland, soon the German Holy Roman Empire), and Lothar received the central part (soon to be conquered and divided between his brothers).

Family strife left the empire weak and undefended, and the Vikings took advantage of the situation. After the Treaty of Verdun, Charles the Bald moved south to defeat Pippin II and add Aquitaine to his territory. He conquered Gothia, and in 844 besieged Toulouse before withdrawing from the city. That year the Vikings entered the Garonne River, took Bordeaux and sailed as far as Toulouse, plundering and killing throughout the valley. They withdrew from Toulouse, without attacking the city.

In 845 Charles the Bald signed a treaty with Pippin II of Aquitaine, recognizing Pippin as king of Aquitaine in exchange for Pippin&#x27;s relinquishing of northern Aquitaine (the County of Poitiers) to Charles. The Aquitanians, now dissatisfied with Pippin, asked Charles to topple him in 848. The following year Charles received Toulouse from Frédelon, the count of Toulouse recently appointed by Pippin, and Charles confirmed Frédelon as count of Toulouse. Aquitaine soon submitted to Charles; in 852 Pippin was imprisoned by the Basques and handed over to Charles (who placed him in a monastery).

In 852 Frédelon of Toulouse died, and Charles appointed Frédelon&#x27;s brother Raymond the new count. This began the dynasty of the counts of Toulouse, who were descendants of Count Raymond I of Toulouse. In 855, following the example of his grandfather Charlemagne, Charles the Bald recreated the kingdom of Aquitaine (without Gothia) and gave the crown to his son Charles the Child. Pippin II of Aquitaine escaped from the monastery in 854, and unsuccessfully attempted to foment an insurrection in Aquitaine. He appealed to the Vikings for help and in 864, at the head of a Viking army, unsuccessfully besieged Toulouse. The Vikings left to plunder other areas of Aquitaine and Pippin II was captured and again placed in a monastery by his uncle, where he soon died.

In 866, Charles the Child died; Charles the Bald made his other son, Louis the Stammerer, the new king of Aquitaine. By then, the central state in the kingdom of France was losing its authority. Charles was unsuccessful at containing the Vikings and local populations relied on their counts, who became the chief authorities. As their power increased, they established local dynasties. Wars began between the central authorities and the counts and between counts, which weakened defenses against the Vikings. Western Europe, France in particular, entered a new dark age which would be more disastrous than that of the sixth and seventh centuries.

Charles the Bald signed the 877 Capitulary of Quierzy, allowing counts to be succeeded by their sons, before his death four months later; this formed the basis of feudalism in western Europe. He was succeeded as king of France by his son, Louis the Stammerer, king of Aquitaine. Louis did not choose any of his sons as the new king of Aquitaine, putting an end to the kingdom. He died in 879 and was succeeded by his two sons, Louis III and Carloman. Louis III inherited northwest France, and Carloman inherited Burgundy and Aquitaine. However, from 870 to 890 central power was so weak that the counts in southern France were autonomous and Paris would not reassert its authority over the south of France for four centuries.

== 877–10th century==
By the end of the ninth century Toulouse was the capital of the county of Toulouse, and was ruled by the independent dynasty founded by Frédelon. The counts of Toulouse were challenged by those of Auvergne, who ruled the northeastern part of former Aquitaine and claimed Toulouse. The counts of Toulouse survived; although the county was a small part of the former Aquitaine, at the death of Count William the Pious of Auvergne in 918 it acquired Gothia. This doubled its territory, reuniting Toulouse with the Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to Nîmes. The county of Toulouse took shape from the city in the west to the Rhône in the east, an entity which would survive until the French Revolution as the province of Languedoc. Toulouse would never again be part of Aquitaine, whose capital would become Poitiers and then Bordeaux. William the Pious was the first to recreate the title of Duke of Aquitaine for himself during the 890s, and the count of Poitiers inherited the title in 927. In 932 King Rudolph of France, fighting the count of Poitiers, conferred the title of Duke of Aquitaine to new ally Count Raymond Pons of Toulouse.

The French throne had become a nearly empty title. After Rudolph&#x27;s death, a faction crowned the English-bred Carolingian prince Louis IV from Overseas. Raymond III Pons belonged to the opposing faction, and when he died in 950 Louis IV bestowed the title of Duke of Aquitaine on Louis IV ally Count William III Towhead of Poitiers. The title of Duke of Aquitaine would be held by the family of the counts of Poitiers, whose power base at Poitou was in northwestern Aquitaine. At the death of Carolingian king of France Louis V in 987 the Robertian faction had its chief, Hugh Capet, elected to the French throne; This ended the Carolingian dynasty. Hugh Capet founded the Capetian dynasty, which would rule France for the next eight centuries.

The counts of Toulouse extended their domain to the Mediterranean coast, but their rule was short-lived. During the 10th century civilization, the arts and education had declined; a rebirth of culture and order during the reign of Charlemagne was smothered by Viking invasions, augmented by poor weather and plagues which contributed to population loss. Large areas of western Europe returned to wilderness, and cities were depopulated. Churches were abandoned or plundered; Christianity lost much of its moral authority, although Roman culture survived in scattered monasteries. This contrasted with the flourishing emirate of Córdoba in Spain and the Byzantine Empire. Authority decentralized, falling from counts to viscounts to thousands of local feudal lords. By the end of the century, France was governed by thousands of local rulers who controlled one town or one castle and a few surrounding villages. Between 900 and 980 the counts of Toulouse gradually lost control to local dynastic rulers, and by 1000 ruled only a few scattered estates; the city was ruled by a viscount, independent of the counts.

Invasions had also resumed. Emir of Córdoba Abd al-Rahman III reunited Muslim Spain and brought the emirate to its zenith, transforming it into the caliphate of Córdoba in 929. During the 920s, he launched an offensive against the Christian kingdoms in northern Spain. In 920 one of Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s armies crossed the Pyrenees, reaching Toulouse without capturing the city. Four years later, the Magyars launched a westward expedition and reached Toulouse before their defeat by Count Raymond III Pons. By the end of the 10th century, the Carolingian wars and subsequent invasions had left the county in disarray. Land was left uncultivated, and many farms were abandoned. Toulouse&#x27;s proximity to Muslim Spain gave it a flow of knowledge and culture from the schools and printing houses of Córdoba, and it had retained more of the Roman legacy than northern France.

== 11th century==

At the beginning of the millennium, the church was co-opted by the Toulouse administration; the Saint-Sernin church, the Daurade basilica and the Saint-Étienne cathedral were not maintained properly, and the Cluniac Reforms began. Bishop Isarn, aided by Pope Gregory VII, gave the Daurade Basilica to the Cluniac abbots in 1077. In Saint-Sernin he was opposed by Raimond Gayrard, a provost who had built a hospital for the poor and wanted to build a basilica. Supported by Count Guilhem IV, Gayrard received permission from Pope Urban II to dedicate the basilica in 1096.

During this period Toulouse developed more efficient agricultural methods; the suburbs of Saint-Michel and Saint-Cyprien were built and Saint-Sernin and Saint-Pierre des Cuisines developed. The Daurade bridge, connecting Saint-Cyprien to the city, was built in 1181.

==12th century==
The end of the 11th century marked the departure of count Raymond IV for the Crusades. Wars of succession followed, and Toulouse was besieged several times. In 1119 the city&#x27;s population proclaimed Alphonse Jourdain count, and Jourdain reduced their taxes in gratitude.

At his death, an administration of eight &quot;capitulaires&quot; was created. Under the direction of the count, they regulated commerce and enforced the law. The first acts of the city&#x27;s consuls (named capitouls from the 13th century onwards) date to 1152.

In 1176 the &quot;chapitre&quot; had 12 members, each representing a district of Toulouse. The consuls opposed Count Raimond V; the city&#x27;s population was divided, and in 1189 (after 10 years of fighting) the count submitted to the town council.

Construction of the Capitole de Toulouse began in 1190. With 24 members, the capitouls gave themselves the rights of law enforcement, commerce and taxation. The capitouls gave Toulouse relative independence for nearly 600 years, until the French Revolution.

== 13th century==

Catharism was a Christian movement espousing the separation of the material and the spiritual, partially inspired by the Bogomils of Bulgaria. Accused of heresy, the Cathars had a large following in the south of France; during the 12th century. Mandated by the Pope, Simon de Montfort tried to exterminate them.

The bishop Foulques, who fought against the cathar heresy, encouraged the Albigensian Crusade and rebuilt the Toulouse Cathedral, making it the very first example of a militant architecture designed for preaching and to restore the image of the Catholic Church: the Southern French Gothic. The consuls, unwilling to encourage the city&#x27;s division, defied the Pope and refused to identify the heretics. Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse, an excommunicated Catholic, sympathised with the heretics because of the massacre at Béziers.

Although Simon de Montfort&#x27;s first siege of Toulouse in 1211 was unsuccessful, two years later he defeated the city&#x27;s army. With many hostages, he entered the city in 1216 and appointed himself as count. De Montfort was killed by a stone at the Siege of Toulouse in 1218. Until the final siege, the &quot;whites&quot; were opposed by the city&#x27;s populace and Louis VII relented in 1219. Raymond VI, recognizing his support from the population (which helped him preserve his interests), gave his last prerogatives to the Capitouls.

==13th to 14th century==

The fight of the Catholic Church against Catharism had several consequences for Toulouse: in 1215 Saint Dominic founded the Order of Preachers there. The 1229 Treaty of Paris introduced the University of Toulouse, which aimed to teach theology and Aristotelian philosophy. Copied from the Parisian model, its curriculum was intended to combat heresy. Then, a nearly four-century inquisition (with suspected persons driven into exile or to conversion) began, centred in the city.

Convicted of heresy, Count Raimond VII died in 1249 without an heir; the county passed to the King of France, and the Capitouls&#x27; power weakened. In 1321, the Jews of Toulouse were victims of a massacre during the Shepherds&#x27; Crusade, during which homes in the Jewish Quarter were ransacked and those who refused to be baptized were killed. In 1323, the Consistori del Gay Saber was established in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours. Toulouse was the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years, and the Consistori existed until 1484. The city grew richer, active in the trade of Bordeaux wine, cereals and textiles with England. In addition to the inquisition, plague, fire, flood and the Hundred Years&#x27; War decimated Toulouse. Despite immigration the city&#x27;s population declined by 10,000 in 70 years, and Toulouse had a population of 22,000 in 1405.

In 1368 Pope Urban V decreed that the remains of famous philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas be transferred to the Church of the Jacobins of Toulouse, considered to be the mother church of the Dominican Order.

==15th to 16th century==

The 15th century began with the creation of the Parlement of Toulouse by Charles VII, making Toulouse the judicial capital of much of southern France until the French Revolution. Promising exemption from taxes, the king reinforced his influence and defied the Capitouls.

Many food shortages occurred at this time. The roads were unreliable, and Toulouse experienced a major fire in 1463; buildings between the current rue Alsace-Lorraine and the Garonne were destroyed. The city&#x27;s population increased, resulting in a housing shortage.

Beginning in 1463, trade in blue dye (woad) flourished. The dye, known at the time as &quot;pastel&quot;, triggered a period of great prosperity. Toulouse used its new wealth to build the homes and public buildings that are today the core of the old city. 
But in 1562 the French Wars of Religion began, disorganizing the trade, and moreover woad was eclipsed by indigo from India, which produced a darker, more-colorfast blue.

In the mid-16th century, the University of Toulouse had nearly 10,000 students. It was a centre of humanistic ferment, as the inquisition continued burning people at the stake. During the 1562 Riots of Toulouse, battles between Huguenots and Catholics resulted in over 3,000 deaths and the arson of 200 homes in the Saint-Georges quarter.

== 17th century ==

When Henry IV acceded to the throne, disorder ended in Toulouse. The &quot;parlement&quot; recognized the King of France, the edict of Nantes was accepted in 1600 and the Capitouls lost their remaining influence they had. A threat more serious than the Fronde reached Toulouse in 1629 and 1652: plague.

For the first time, the city and the local &quot;parlement&quot; cooperated to assist those affected by the epidemic. Most of the clergy and the wealthy left the city, but doctors were required to stay. Starvation led the remaining Capitouls to prevent the butchers and bakers from leaving.

La Grave Hospital accommodated those affected by the epidemic, quarantining them. The Pré des Sept Deniers also accepted many patients under hazardous conditions. Before closing its gates, the city attracted the poor with a medical infrastructure offering more hope than the countryside.
In 1654, when the second epidemic ended, the city was devastated. However, during plague-free periods two major projects were completed: the Pont-Neuf in 1632 and the Canal du Midi in 1682. Famine occurred in 1693.

== 18th century==

Louis de Mondran, inspired by his stay in Paris, was the new city planner. Principal achievements of this period were the Grand Rond, the Cours Dillon, and the facade of the Capitole, completed in 1760.

In 1770, the Cardinal of Brienne laid the first stone of the channel named for him. The channel, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean and the Canal du Midi to the Canal Lateral à la Garonne, was finished six years later. Their confluence is known as Ponts-Jumeaux.

Economic inequality increased, with work for local architects and sculptors. The Reynerie was the summer residence of the husband of the Comtesse du Barry.

At the end of the century, the Blue Penitents worshiped at the Saint-Jérome church. The local &quot;parlement&quot; condemned the Protestants, exercising its power in the trial and execution of Jean Calas. Toulouse&#x27;s population supported the &quot;parlement&quot; when it felt threatened by the monarchy, and the eight Capitouls were now chosen by the &quot;parlement&quot;.

== 19th century ==

The French Revolution changed Toulouse&#x27;s role and its political and social structure.
The city marked the Parisian movement with looting. Five months later, when the Ancien Régime was abolished, &quot;parlement&quot; and the Capitouls received little popular support.

Toulouse&#x27;s regional influence was reduced to the department of Haute-Garonne. Clergy were required to observe the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, imposed by the National Constituent Assembly. A new archbishop was named, over the objections of Loménie de Brienne. The Capitouls were abolished on 14 December 1789; Joseph de Rigaud was Toulouse&#x27;s first mayor, elected on 28 February 1790.

In 1793, during the Paris Commune, Toulouse refused to join the Provence and Aquitaine federalists in Paris. The prospect of war against Austria and internal resistance initiated the Reign of Terror. In 1799 the fortified city resisted attack of British and Spanish royalist armies in the first battle of Toulouse, and Napoleon visited the city in 1808.

In 1814, during the battle of Toulouse, the British army entered the city (which had been abandoned by the imperial army). It was the last battle of the Empire, since Napoleon had abdicated eight days earlier; French commander Jean-de-Dieu Soult had not been informed. Wellington&#x27;s army was welcomed by royalists, preparing Toulouse for the restoration of Louis XVIII.

==20th century==
==21st century==

The AZF chemical plant in Toulouse exploded on 21 September 2001. The explosion, which destroyed the plant— from the city centre—also damaged houses (including more than 20,000 flats), schools, churches, monuments and shops. Twenty-nine people died, and several thousand were injured. The explosion originated in a building containing ammonium nitrate.

In March 2012 local Islamic extremist Mohammed Merah opened fire at a Jewish school in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children. One of the children, an eight-year-old girl, was shot in the head at point-blank range and a 17-year-old boy was critically wounded. President Nicolas Sarkozy called it an &quot;obvious&quot; antisemitic attack: &quot;I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them. All of France is by their side.&quot; The Israeli Prime Minister condemned the &quot;despicable anti-Semitic&quot; murders. After a 32-hour siege and standoff with the police outside his house followed by a raid, Merah jumped off a balcony and was shot in the head and killed. Merah had told police during the standoff that he intended to continue attacking, and loved death as the police loved life. He claimed a connection to al-Qaeda.

<doc id="861503" wikidata="Q5473510" url="?curid=861503" title="Fossil collecting">
<text>Fossil collecting (sometimes, in a non-scientific sense, fossil hunting) is the collection of the fossils for scientific study, hobby, or profit. Fossil collecting, as practiced by amateurs, is the predecessor of modern paleontology and many still collect fossils and study fossils as amateurs. Professionals and amateurs alike collect fossils for their scientific value. A commercial trade in fossils has also long existed, with some of this being practised illegally.

==Process==

===Locating fossils===

====Rock type====
Fossils are generally found in sedimentary rock with differentiated strata representing a succession of deposited material. The occurrence of fossil bearing material depends on environmental factors before and after the time of preservation. After death, the first preserving factor is a rapid burial in water bodies or terrestrial sediment which would help in preserving the specimen. These rocks types are usually termed clastic rock, and are further subdivided into fine, medium and coarse grained material. While fossils can be found in all grain types, more detailed specimens are found in the fine grained material. A second type of burial is the non-clastic rock, form where the rock is made up of the precipitation of compacted fossil material, types of rock include limestone and coal. The third fossil bearing material is the evaporates, which precipitate out of concentrated dissolved salts to form nodular deposits, examples include rock salt and phosphate concentrations. The evaporates are usually associated with gastropod, algae, vertebrate, and trace fossils. Fossils are not to be found in areas of igneous rock (except in some beds between lava flows). In rocks which have undergone metamorphism, fossils are generally so distorted that they are difficult to recognize or have been destroyed completely.

====Preservation====
After burial various factors are at work to endanger the current fossil&#x27;s preserved state. Chemical alteration would change the mineral composition of the fossil, but generally not its appearance, lithification would distort its appearance, the fossil itself may be fully or partially dissolved leaving only a fossil mold.

====Exposure====

Areas where sedimentary rocks are being eroded include exposed mountainous areas, river banks and beds, wave washed sea cliffs, and engineering features like quarries and road cuts. Coal mining operations often yield excellent fossil plants, but the best ones are to be found not in the coal itself but in the associated sedimentary rock deposits called coal measures.

Wave-washed sea cliffs and foreshore exposures are often good places to search for fossils, but always be aware of the state of the tides in the area. Never take chances by climbing high cliffs of crumbling rock or clay (many have died attempting it). Dried up natural lake beds and caves in the form of pitfall traps frequently also have high concentrations of fossils (e.g., Cuddie Springs and Naracoorte Caves in Australia).

Generally in appearance, a fossil will be either a different colour to the surrounding rock, because of the different mineral content, will have a defining shape and texture or a combination of both. A fossil can also be extracted from its geological environment, having similar characteristics in colour naturally embed from the sedimentary formation (surrounding rock) it was found within.

===Collecting techniques===
The techniques used to collect fossils vary depending on the sediment or rock in which the fossils are to be found. For collecting in rock a geological hammer, a variety of cold chisels and a mallet are used to split and break rocks to reveal fossils. Since the rock is deposited in layers, these layers may be split apart to reveal fossils. For soft sediments and unconsolidated deposits, such as sands, silts, and clays, a spade, flat-bladed trowel, and stiff brushes are used. Sieves in a variety of mesh sizes are used to separate fossils from sands and gravels. Sieving is a rougher technique for collecting fossils and can destroy fragile ones. Sometimes, water is run through a sieve to help remove silt and sand. This technique is called wet sieving

Fossils tend to be very fragile and are generally not extracted entirely from the surrounding rock (the matrix) in the field. Cloth, cotton, small boxes and aluminum foil are frequently used to protect fossils being transported. Occasionally, large fragile specimens may need to be protected and supported using a jacket of plaster before their removal from the rock. If a fossil is to be left in situ, a cast may be produced, using plaster of paris or latex. While not preserving every detail, such a cast is inexpensive, easier to transport, causes less damage to the environment, and leaves the fossil in place for others. Fossilized tracks are frequently documented with casts. Subtle fossils which are preserved solely as impressions in sandy layers, such as the Ediacaran fossils, are also usually documented by means of a cast, which shows detail more clearly than the rock itself.

===Preparation and cleaning===

Sometimes, for smaller fossils, a stiff brush may simply be used to dust off and clean the fossil. For larger fossils, a chisel can be used to remove large bits of dirt, however, you run the risk of damaging the fossil.
Running water can cause some types of fossils to either dislodge from the rock, or even crumble and break apart, for they are very fragile. Dental tools are sometimes used to remove small amounts of rock from the fossil.

===Documentation===
A knowledge of the precise location a fossil is essential if the fossil is to have any scientific value. Details of the parent rock strata, the location of the find, and other fossil material associated with the find help scientists to place the fossil in context, in terms of the time, location and situation in which the organism lived. Data logs, photographs, and sketches may accompany detailed field notes to assist in the locating of a fossiliferous outcrop. Individual fossils are ideally cataloged with a locality number and a unique specimen number. This allows a collection to be easily searched and specimens located. Catologing of collections is almost universal in large institutions like museums.

==Collecting ethics==
To collect fossils, there are various legal realities that must be observed. Permission should be sought before collection begins on private land. Hammering the rocks in national parks and other areas of natural beauty is often discouraged and in most cases is illegal.

The first expressly worded fossil-collecting code was published from the museum-home of pioneering geologist Hugh Miller at Cromarty, on the Highland east coast of Scotland, 11 April 2008. It was introduced by Michael Russell, Minister for Environment, Scotland, as part of celebrations honouring the bicentennial of the founding of the Geological Society of London. The code supplements an existing draft drawn up by English Nature.

The code advises fossil collectors to seek permission from landowners, to collect responsibly, record details, seek advice on finding an unusual fossil and label the specimens and care for them. Its principles establish a framework of advice on best practices in the collection, identification, conservation and storage of fossil specimens.

The non-binding code of ethics for this field was drawn up by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) following many months of consultation with fossil collectors, landowners, palaeontological researchers, and staff of Scotland&#x27;s museums.

===Fossil trade===
Fossil trading is the practice of buying and selling fossils. This is illegal when it comes to stolen fossils, and some important scientific specimens are sold to collectors, rather than given or obtained by museums and institutes of study. Much focus has been put on the illegal fossil dealing in China, where many specimens have been stolen. The fossil trade of Morocco has also been the focus of international attention. The trade is lucrative, and many celebrities collect fossils.

The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP), an international association of professional and amateur vertebrate paleontologists, believes that scientifically important fossils—especially but not exclusively those found on public lands—should be held in perpetuity in the public trust, preferably in a museum or research institution, where they can benefit the scientific community as a whole as well as future generations. In the United States, Paleontological Resources Preservation Act. S. 546 and H. R. 2416 were introduced in the US Congress with SVP&#x27;s full support.

Many commercial fossil collectors and dealers believe that such policies are a breach of their rights. The argument has also been put forth that there are too few professional paleontologists to collect and preserve fossils currently exposed to the elements, and that it is therefore essential that private citizens be allowed to collect them for the sake of their preservation. Eric Scott, the Curator of Paleontology for the San Bernardino County Museum, argues that 1) private citizens and amateur (not for profit) collectors can and do participate frequently in the permitted recovery and preservation of significant vertebrate fossils, and 2) preservation of significant fossils does not require or mandate &quot;sale&quot; of those fossils.

According to the ethics by-law of SVP, &quot;The barter, sale, or purchase of scientifically significant vertebrate fossils is not condoned, unless it brings them into or keeps them within a public trust.&quot;

Some fossil trade is not for collecting but due to the use of certain fossils in traditional medicine mainly in East Asia but also in Europe and other places.

==Societies and clubs==
Many include fossil collectors. Lapidary clubs also include fossil collectors. In addition, paleontological societies and fossil clubs exist. There is some overlap between fossil collecting, mineral collecting, and amateur geology.

<doc id="861504" wikidata="Q7847630" url="?curid=861504" title="Truggy">
<text>A truggy is a type of high performance off-road racing vehicle that combines features from two older existing categories of off-road racing vehicles, trucks and buggies. The first truggies were built for racing in the SCORE and BITD off-road desert racing series, held in Mexico, California, Nevada and Arizona.

==History==

Desert off-road racing began in the 1960s in Baja California and expanded over the next 30 years to include dozens of races and several sanctioning organizations. These organizations created a class structure so that while many types of vehicles could race, direct competition could be segmented into groups of similar vehicles. These classes evolved over time, and included classes for near-stock vehicles, as well as &quot;open&quot; classes that permitted unique custom-built vehicles.

One of the most popular and fastest classes in the 1990s was the &#x27;Open Buggy&#x27; or &#x27;Unlimited&#x27; class, which permitted maximum leeway in designing a vehicle. Most buggies of the era remained loosely based on the architecture of the original VW Beetle automobile, with a rear engine, an independent rear transaxle suspension, and relatively shorter wheelbase. The &quot;open&quot; or &quot;unlimited&quot; buggy classes became the home to extremely high performance vehicles. These &quot;Class 1 unlimited&quot; buggies soon did away with the entire production Volkswagen chassis and sheet metal, and instead used a full tube chassis. In almost all cases they continued to use the rear-engine / transaxle architecture of the VW, replacing the iconic Volkswagen&#x27;s air cooled 4-cylinder boxer engine with larger and more powerful engines from a variety of manufacturers, especially the related Porsche motors. Transaxle strength was often a limiting factor of these designs, while their greatest attributes included their light weight, extreme wheel travel, strength and overall custom built suitability to the task of racing at high speeds on harsh desert roads.

Another groups of classes that had increasing popularity throughout the 1990s were the various truck based classes, for both mini and full-sized trucks. These truck classes were popular as they reflected more closely the vehicles bought by average American and Mexican consumers for use off-road, as they were based on modified production trucks of the era. The fastest truck classes evolved over time from one with limited modifications to a more open class rules, that permitted massive changes to many aspects of the vehicle, but still generally required using the stock frame and some of the body from a production vehicle. These high-end trucks were both very fast and very reliable. Their greatest attributes included extremely large and powerful front-mounted V8 engines, larger wheels and tires to absorb rough terrain, extremely rugged rear truck axles, and increasingly long travel suspension.
In 1994 SCORE decided to run the Parker 400 off-road race over two days. Day one would see the new class of Trophy Trucks run on the course, and day two would see all other classes race over the same course. Jim Smith, owner of Ultra Custom Wheels entered his Mike Smith built Trophy Truck and also entered a Class One car into the race. However the Class One car, was in fact his Trophy Truck without its body, but with its interior aluminium panels painted black. Jim and his crew called it a truggy and the name took hold.

In 1995 the team Terrible Herbst Motorsports decided to build an unlimited Class 1 buggy that used the basic front engine, rear solid axle architecture of a truck. This vehicle, which was designed and fabricated by Mike Smith Fabrication. it was built like an unlimited buggy, with a full custom triangulated tubular chrome-moly chassis, but with the truck-like layout of big American V-8 motor in front of the driver, and a very strong truck-style rear axle and large 37&quot; Trophy truck sized wheels and tires on all corners.

The combination in many ways combined the best characteristics of each of the two donor types: the lower weight, higher strength chassis, and extremely large suspension travel of the buggies, with the massive horsepower and stronger rear end design of the top trucks.

The Terrible Herbst Truggy was given the name &quot;El Tiburon&quot; and &quot;The Landshark&quot;, in part due to the paint scheme originally applied to the all-fiberglass custom body of the vehicle. It dominated class one for many years after its introduction, winning back-to-back SCORE Class 1 titles in 1997 and 1998, as well as the overall (all classes) points championship in 1998. It continued to be the most dominant vehicle in the sport for nearly a decade, winning first and second place repeatedly in both class and overall categories in both the SCORE and the BITD series.

As a result of this domination the truggy format became popular with other builders and the term became the generic term from a specially built off-road vehicle that uses truck architecture (front engine, solid rear axle) but unlimited buggy style construction (tube chassis, no production parts retained). The format also became popular with the newer disciplines of closed-course stadium off-road racing, and extreme rock-crawling, where 4-wheel drive versions were created.
