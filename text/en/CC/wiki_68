<text>USS &quot;John C. Butler&quot; (DE-339) was the lead ship of her class of destroyer escorts in the service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was recommissioned between 1950 and 1957 and finally sunk as a target in 1971.

==Namesake==
John Clarence Butler was born on 2 February 1921 in Liberty, Arizona. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as a seaman second class on 19 February 1941 at Long Beach, California. Reporting for active duty at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base at Long Beach, Butler transferred to Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida on 27 March. On 3 April, after termination of his enlisted service, he accepted an appointment as an aviation cadet in the Naval Reserve. He received flight training at Pensacola from 4 April-29–July 1941, and reported to the Naval Air Station, Miami for further instruction (1 August). Designated a Naval Aviator on 29 August he was appointment as Ensign in the Naval Reserve on 6 September, before receiving orders to the Advanced Training Group (ACTG), U.S. Pacific Fleet, for active duty, involving flying under instruction on 17 September. Receiving an assignment to the aircraft carrier , arriving in port at San Diego, Butler flew one of the 43 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers attached to &quot;Saratoga&quot;&#x27;s Scouting Squadron Three (VS-3) and Bombing Squadron Three (VB-3).

On 18 April 1942, during the Doolittle Raid Butler piloted aircraft an SBD-3 Dauntless flying off , searching for any forward deployed Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) ships that could radio back to Japan to give warning of the raiders. During the scouting mission, he engaged a long Japanese patrol boat towing a smaller boat &quot;painted white&quot;. Attacking in two separate dives, Butler dropped two 100-pound bombs, both of which were duds. Striking the craft with a 500-pound bomb on the port side, his plane received three hits from enemy fire. Disengaging he noticed the smaller craft belching oil and smoke, estimating it later sank. The larger boat remained undamaged.

VB-3 received a transfer from &quot;Saratoga&quot; to which left Pearl Harbor on 30 May to intercept the IJN carrier force headed for Midway Island. During the Battle of Midway on the afternoon of 4 June 1942 10 dive-bombers from VB-6 (and 14 from VB-3), took off from &quot;Enterprise&quot; (&quot;Yorktown&quot; having been damaged in an earlier Japanese attack) at 17:30. The dive-bomber pilots eventually discovered Hiryū, the fourth and only surviving enemy carrier. VB-6 aircraft attacked first, missing the ship with several bombs. About a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters suddenly swarmed in amongst the slower Dauntless dive-bombers. At some point during the melee Butler&#x27;s aircraft was shot down. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

==History==
&quot;John C. Butler&quot; was laid down by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Ltd., in Orange, Texas, on 5 October 1943; launched on 12 November 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Walter C. Butler, mother of Ensign Butler; and commissioned on 31 March 1944.

===World War II===
The new destroyer escort conducted shakedown training off Bermuda before departing Hampton Roads on 5 June 1944 for the Pacific. Sailing via the Panama Canal, she arrived Pearl Harbor on 26 June and engaged in convoy and training operations in July. &quot;John C. Butler&quot; then departed Pearl Harbor on 9 August screening transports bound for the invasion of the Palau Islands. After seeing them safely to Tulagi, the ship operated with escort carriers out of Manus Island on pre-invasion strikes. Two islands wanted as advance bases for the long-awaited move into the Philippines, Morotai and Peleliu, were stormed on 15 September; and &quot;John C. Butler&quot; provided anti-submarine and anti-aircraft protection for the supporting carriers. Returning to Manus on 30 September, she replenished in preparation for the Leyte operation in October.

====Battle of Leyte Gulf, October 1944====
The escort vessel sailed with Rear Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie&#x27;s escort carrier group on 12 October to provide air cover for the massive movement of transports into Leyte Gulf. After the initial landings, the three carrier groups, soon to become famous by their radio code names, &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, &quot;Taffy 2&quot;, and &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, took station east of the Philippines to lend close air support.

The Japanese fleet was closing the Philippines in a last attempt to annihilate the invasion force, with heavy ships designated to break into Leyte Gulf from north and south, and a diversionary fleet of carriers to draw Admiral William F. Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet off to the North. In the first two actions of the massive Battle of Leyte Gulf which ensued, the Battle of Sibuyan Sea and the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Japanese were badly mauled. But Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force still transited San Bernardino Strait the night of 24–25 October, and just after sunrise bore down on the relatively unprotected Taffy 3, including &quot;John C. Butler&quot;.

The two-hour Battle off Samar which followed has taken a rightful place among the most memorable actions in naval history. The slow escort carriers launched all planes to attack the Japanese cruisers and battleships, and &quot;John C. Butler&quot; and her sisters laid heavy smoke to confuse enemy batteries. A rain squall provided cover for a turn to the south, and just after 07:30 the destroyers began their gallant torpedo attacks against great odds. Destroyers , , and , and DE made close-in attacks on cruisers and battleships, forcing them to zig-zag, while aircraft made continuous attacks. Soon after this first attack, &quot;John C. Butler&quot; turned from the carriers to launch her remaining torpedoes, then exchanged gunfire with a heavy cruiser. The DE continued to fire and dodge heavy-caliber fire until dangerously low on ammunition, then returned to the carrier formation to provide smoke coverage.

Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague, commander of Taffy 3, later described the next surprising development: &quot;At 0925 my mind was occupied with dodging torpedoes when near the bridge I heard one of the signalmen yell, &#x27;... dammit, boys, they&#x27;re getting away!&#x27; I could not believe my eyes, but it looked as if the whole Japanese fleet was indeed retiring... At best, I had expected to be swimming by this time.&quot; The Japanese – damaged and fearing heavier air attack – had indeed reversed course. Though the escort carriers lost one of their number and three escorts, their valiant fight had stopped the Japanese from attacking the transports in Leyte Gulf. However, shortly after the Center Force retreated from the engagement, the first attack of the war from a kamikaze unit fell upon the remaining ships of Taffy 3, sinking a second escort carrier and damaging all but one of the rest.

After rescuing survivors from , &quot;John C. Butler&quot; escorted the surviving carriers of Taffy 3 via Manus to Pearl Harbor, then returned to Manus on 17 December. Departing with escort carriers on 31 December, she protected amphibious transports steaming to the invasion of Luzon. During the voyage through the South China Sea, the ships encountered and drove off determined &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. On the evening of 8 January 1945, &quot;John C. Butler&quot; and other escorts shot several &quot;kamikazes&quot; down. She operated off Lingayen Gulf from 9–17 January and screened carriers during massive strikes in support of ground operations. Departing the Luzon coast, she arrived at Ulithi on 23 January to prepare for the next important amphibious landing — Iwo Jima.

====Iwo Jima and Okinawa====
The veteran DE took part in rehearsals in the Marianas, and arrived off Iwo Jima on 19 February with an escort carrier group. She again fought off a severe air attack on 21 February. She remained on duty off Iwo Jima until 9 March, when she sailed for Ulithi, having helped to win another important island air base for the eventual attack on Japan.

Okinawa was to be the site of the last and largest of the Pacific amphibious assaults. &quot;John C. Butler&quot; sailed on 26 March with transports; and, as the troops stormed ashore on 1 April, she resumed her now-familiar screening duties with carrier groups. As the Japanese launched fruitless suicide attacks, the ship escorted carriers into Kerama Retto, rescued downed pilots, and ferried men and material. Transferred to dangerous outer picket duty north of Ie Shima on 20 May, she was attacked by six &quot;kamikazes&quot; just before sunset. Skillful gunnery accounted for five of the attackers, and &quot;John C. Butler&quot; sustained damage only to her mast and antennas. She sailed on 27 May for repairs in the Philippines.

The ship returned to Okinawa with a convoy on 4 July, and spent the last month of the long war on convoy duty between that island and the Pacific advance bases. She returned to San Pedro, Los Angeles on 23 November and decommissioned on 26 June 1946, joining the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California.

===Cold War===
With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, &quot;John C. Butler&quot; recommissioned on 27 December 1950. Following shakedown, she was assigned to 11th Naval District for the job of training naval reservists on short sea cruises. Thus, she helped maintain trained officers and men to meet the U.S. Navy&#x27;s cold war commitments. In addition to reserve cruises, she took part in the training program of Fleet Sonar School, San Diego. She decommissioned on 18 December 1957 and re-entered the Reserve Fleet, San Diego. She was eventually sunk as a target in December 1971.

==Awards==
&quot;John C. Butler&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service, and was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for her part in the Battle off Samar.

<text>In communications, a system is wideband when the message bandwidth significantly exceeds the coherence bandwidth of the channel. Some communication links have such a high data rate that they are forced to use a wide bandwidth; other links may have relatively low data rates, but deliberately use a wider bandwidth than &quot;necessary&quot; for that data rate in order to gain other advantages; see &quot;spread spectrum&quot;.

A wideband antenna is one with approximately or exactly the same operating characteristics over a very wide Passband. It is distinguished from broadband antennas, where the passband is large, but the antenna gain and/or radiation pattern need not stay the same over the passband.

The term Wideband Audio or (also termed HD Voice or Wideband Voice) denotes a telephony using a wideband codec, which uses a greater frequency range of the audio spectrum than conventional voiceband telephone calls, resulting in a clearer sound. Wideband in this context is usually considered to cover frequencies in the range of 50–7,000 Hz, therefore allowing audio with richer tones and better quality.

According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, WIDEBAND is a registered trademark of WideBand Corporation, a US-based manufacturer of Gigabit Ethernet equipment.

Within Australia and New Zealand, the word WIDEBAND is a registered trademark of &quot;Wideband Technology Pty Ltd&quot;, an Australian-based company specialising in data and communication equipment.

In some contexts wideband is distinguished from broadband in being broader.

<doc id="863800" wikidata="Q505574" url="?curid=863800" title="Villa La Rotonda">
<text>Villa La Rotonda is a Renaissance villa just outside Vicenza in Northern Italy designed by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, and begun in 1567, though not completed until the 1590s. The villa&#x27;s official name is Villa Almerico Capra Valmarana, but it is also known as &quot;La Rotonda&quot;, &quot;Villa Rotonda&quot;, &quot;Villa Capra&quot;, and &quot;Villa Almerico Capra&quot;. The name &quot;Capra&quot; derives from the Capra brothers, who completed the building after it was ceded to them in 1592. Along with other works by Palladio, the building is conserved as part of the World Heritage Site &quot;City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto&quot;.

==Inspiration==

In 1565 a priest, Paolo Almerico, on his retirement from the Vatican (as referendario apostolico of Pope Pius IV and afterwards Pius V), returned to his home town of Vicenza in the Venetian countryside and built a country house. This house, later known as &#x27;La Rotonda&#x27;, was to be one of Palladio&#x27;s best-known legacies to the architectural world. Villa Capra may have inspired a thousand subsequent buildings, but the villa was itself inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.

==Design==

The site selected was a hilltop just outside the city of Vicenza. Unlike some other Palladian villas of the Veneto, the building was not designed from the start to accommodate a working farm. This sophisticated building was designed for a site which was, in modern terminology, &quot;suburban&quot;. Palladio classed the building as a &quot;palazzo&quot; rather than a villa.

The design is for a completely symmetrical building having a square plan with four facades, each of which has a projecting portico. The whole is contained within an imaginary circle which touches each corner of the building and centres of the porticos (&quot;illustration, left&quot;).

The name &quot;La Rotonda&quot; refers to the central circular hall with its dome. To describe the villa, as a whole, as a rotunda is technically incorrect, as the building is not circular but rather the intersection of a square with a cross. Each portico has steps leading up to it, and opens via a small cabinet or corridor to the circular domed central hall. This and all other rooms were proportioned with mathematical precision according to Palladio&#x27;s rules of architecture which he published in &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot;. Work spaces for the villa&#x27;s servants are hidden underneath the first floor, which is accessed via staircases hidden inside the walls of the central hall.

The design reflected the humanist values of Renaissance architecture. In order for each room to have some sun, the design was rotated 45 degrees from each cardinal point of the compass. Each of the four porticos has pediments graced by statues of classical deities. The pediments were each supported by six Ionic columns. Each portico was flanked by a single window. All principal rooms were on the second floor or &quot;piano nobile&quot;.

Building began in 1567. Neither Palladio nor the owner, Paolo Almerico, were to see the completion of the villa. Palladio died in 1580 and a second architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi, was employed by the new owners to oversee the completion. One of the major changes he made to the original plan was to modify the two-storey central hall.

Palladio had intended it to be covered by a high semi-circular dome but Scamozzi designed a lower dome with an oculus (intended to be open to the sky) inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The dome was ultimately completed with a cupola.

==Interior==
The interior design of the Villa was to be as wonderful, if not more so, than the exterior.

Alessandro, Giovanni Battista Maganza, and Anselmo Canera were commissioned to paint frescoes in the principal salons.

Among the four principal salons on the &quot;piano nobile&quot; are the West Salon (also called the Holy Room, because of the religious nature of its frescoes and ceiling), and the East Salon, which contains an allegorical life story of the first owner, Paolo Almerico, his many admirable qualities portrayed in fresco.

The highlight of the interior is the central, circular hall, surrounded by a balcony and covered by the domed ceiling; it soars the full height of the main house up to the cupola, with walls decorated in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;.

Abundant frescoes create an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of a cathedral than the principal salon of a country house.

==Landscape==

From the porticos, views of the surrounding countryside can be seen; this is purposeful as the Villa was designed to be in harmony with the landscape.

This was in contrast to such buildings as Villa Farnese of just 16 years earlier.

While the house appears to be completely symmetrical, it actually has deviations, designed to allow each façade to complement the surrounding landscape and topography. Hence, there are variations in the façades, in the width of steps, retaining walls, etc. In this way, the symmetry of the architecture allows for the asymmetry of the landscape, and creates a seemingly symmetrical whole. The landscape is a panoramic vision of trees, meadows and woods, with Vicenza on the horizon.

The northwest portico is set onto the hill as the termination of a straight carriage drive from the principal gates. This carriageway is an avenue between the service blocks, built by the Capra brothers, who acquired the Villa in 1591; they commissioned Vincenzo Scamozzi to complete the villa and construct the range of staff and agricultural buildings.

==Current conditions==

In 1994 UNESCO designated the building as part of a World Heritage Site.

A former family owner of the villa was Mario di Valmarana (1929–2010), a former professor of architecture at the University of Virginia. It was his declared ambition to preserve Villa Rotonda so that it may be appreciated by future generations. His brother was Lodovico Valmarana (1926–2018), Count of Valmarana and Nogara, whose father Count Andrea Valmarana (1891–1976) purchased the villa in 1912, with the villa now owned by Lodovico&#x27;s son, Count Nicolò Valmarana. The interior is open to the public Friday through Sunday, and the grounds are open every day.

==Film==

In 1979 the American film director Joseph Losey filmed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in Villa La Rotonda and the Veneto region of Italy. The film was nominated for several César Awards in 1980 including Best Director, and has generally been praised as one of the finer cinematic adaptations of opera.

===England===

Five houses have been built in England based on Palladio&#x27;s Villa Rotonda: Henbury Hall, Cheshire, is the most recent; Chiswick House, Greater London, and Mereworth Castle, Kent, are protected as listed buildings; Foots Cray Place, Kent, and Nuthall Temple, Nottinghamshire have been demolished.
One of the earliest Palladian villas in the north of England is Rokeby Park.

The &quot;House of Palestine&quot; (&quot;Bayt al-Filastin&quot;), built at the top of biblical Mount Gerizim, which towers over the Palestinian city of Nablus, north of Jerusalem, closely resembles the Villa Rotonda. It is owned by Palestinian millionaire Munib al-Masri.

===Poland===

Palaces built in Poland based on Palladio&#x27;s Villa Rotonda include the Królikarnia (Rabbit House) Palace, the Belweder in Warsaw and the Skórzewski Palace in Lubostroń.

===Belarus===

The interior of the main building of the Gomel Palace in Gomel in the Eastern Belarus is based on Villa Rotonda.

===United States===

For the competition to design the President&#x27;s House in Washington, DC, Thomas Jefferson anonymously submitted a design that was a variation on the Villa Rotonda. Though James Hoban&#x27;s Palladian design for what would become known as the White House was selected, the influence of the Villa Rotonda can also be seen at Jefferson&#x27;s own iconic home of Monticello.

<doc id="863802" wikidata="Q172852" url="?curid=863802" title="C-41 process">
<text>C-41 is a chromogenic color print film developing process introduced by Kodak in 1972, superseding the C-22 process. C-41, also known as CN-16 by Fuji, CNK-4 by Konica, and AP-70 by AGFA, is the most popular film process in use, with most, if not all photofinishing labs devoting at least one machine to this development process.

Processed C-41 negatives, as with all color films, consist of an image formed of dye. Due to the long-term instability of dyes, C-41 negatives can fade or color-shift over time. This was a significant problem with early films; whether the newer films are archival or not is a subject of some debate.

==Film structure==

C-41 film consists of an acetate or polyester film base, onto which multiple emulsions are coated. Each layer is only sensitive to a certain color of visible light.

In an idealized, illustrative example, there are three light-sensitive layers: one is red-sensitive, another is green-sensitive, and the top is blue-sensitive. Beneath the blue layer is a yellow filter, composed of dyes or colloidal silver, also known as Carey Lea Silver. All silver-based photographic emulsions have some sensitivity to blue light, regardless of what other colors they may be sensitized for. This filter layer serves to remove the blue light, which would expose the layers beneath it. Beneath the blue-sensitive layer and the yellow filter are the green- and red-sensitive layers.

Each emulsion layer, in addition to the light-sensitive components, contains dye coupler chemicals. These couplers, located in the blue-, green-, and red-sensitive layers, produce yellow, magenta, and cyan dyes, respectively, when developed.

The illustrative example outlined above differs from the design of actual film, in respect to the number of layers. Almost all C-41 films contain multiple layers for each color-sensitive layer. Individual layers have different speed and contrast characteristics, allowing the film to be correctly exposed over a wider range of lighting conditions.

In addition to multiple emulsion layers, real films have other layers that are not sensitive to light. In some cases, the base is first coated with an antihalation layer to minimize reflections. Some films are top-coated with UV-blocking layers or anti-scratch coatings. There also may be layers to separate different emulsions, or additional filter layers.

===The negative===

After processing, the resulting film is a negative, meaning that the darkest spots on the film are those areas that were brightest in the source. Light is projected through the finished negative onto color photographic paper, yielding positive image prints.

Nearly all C-41 films also include an orange mask to offset the optical inadequacies of the dyes in the film. These C-41 negatives appear orange when viewed directly, though the orange base is compensated for in the formulation of color print materials. Some C-41 films, intended for scanning, do not have this orange base.

==Process==

The C-41 process is the same for all C-41 films, although different manufacturers&#x27; processing chemistries vary slightly. C-41 was introduced with Kodacolor II and its professional equivalent, Vericolor II, as the &#x27;Flexicolor&#x27; process, replacing C-22, which was used with Kodacolor-X and Ektacolor Professional. Compared to C-22, the working temperature of C-41 is higher, at , versus for C-22; total processing time was cut almost in half with C-41, but it is very sensitive to development bath time.

After exposure, the film is developed in a &quot;color developer&quot;. The developing ingredient is a paraphenylene diamine-based chemical branded as CD-4. The developer develops the silver in the emulsion layers. As the silver is developing, oxidized developer reacts with the dye couplers, resulting in formation of dyes.

The control of temperature and agitation of the film in the developer is critical in obtaining consistent, accurate results. Incorrect temperature can result in severe color shifts or significant under- or overdevelopment of the film.

After the developer, a bleach converts the metallic silver generated by development to silver halide, which is soluble in fixer. After the bleach, a fixer removes the silver halide. This is followed by a wash, and a final stabilizer and rinse to complete the process.

The bleach in C-41 does not use ferricyanide, which increases cost; it is possible to develop C-41 using substitute chemicals, which requires an extra step for a stop bath after the developer. There are simplified versions of the process that use a combined bleach-fix (EDTA) that dissolves the silver generated by development and removes undeveloped silver halide. These are not used by commercial C-41 processors, and are marketed for home or field use.

===Push processing===
Similar to black-and-white film processing, the C-41 process can be adjusted to push-process films. Kodak recommends an additional duration of 30 seconds in the developer bath to push certain films by one stop.

Due to the complexity of the film and exacting nature of the process, the results vary widely; as with black-and-white negatives, the process generally results in a negative that is higher in contrast and sometimes higher in grain.

===Cross processing===
It is also possible to cross-process slide film for the E-6 process in C-41, which yields negatives with a color shift and stronger saturation. Varying brands and film speeds yield different color shifts producing bright, saturated colors and high contrast. C-41 film also may be processed in E-6, yielding positive images with a strong green cast, caused by the orange mask.

C-41 film can be processed in standard black-and-white chemicals, to produce a monochrome negative image. The negatives will typically be of very low contrast, and cloudy, partly caused by the orange mask.

==Black-and-white use==

===C-41 &quot;chromogenic&quot; black-and-white films===
While C-41 is usually considered a color process, Ilford currently manufactures a &quot;chromogenic&quot; C-41 compatible black-and-white film, XP2 Super. Kodak used to manufacture a similar film, BW400CN, but this was discontinued in August 2014. (These should not be confused with regular black-and-white films, which are not compatible with C-41 chemistry.)

These films work like any other C-41 film; development causes dyes to form in the emulsion. Their structure, however, is different. Although they may have multiple layers, all are sensitive to all colors of light, and are designed to produce a black dye. The result is a black-and white image.

The Kodak film has the same orange base as color C-41 films; the base on XP2 is Purple and Fuji films are clear. The orange base on the Kodak film allows them to be printed with correct blacks on standard color printing machines, but this film can be difficult to print on multigrade black-and-white paper, whose contrast is determined by the use of a colored filter during the printing process. Conversely, the clear-based Ilford and Fuji films sometimes results in off-color prints on color paper, but can be optically printed on black-and-white paper, just like any other black-and-white film.

It is often said that prints from these films do not have grain. While they may not appear to have grain, this statement is technically incorrect. On an image from regular black-and-white film, the individual silver particles forming the image are seen as grain. The image on the C-41 films, however, does not contain silver. Instead, C-41 negatives and prints have clouds of dye, causing the resulting image to appear different from that of silver grain.

===Traditional black-and-white films ===
While regular black-and-white films are not intended for use with C-41 chemistry, some photographers have used C-41 developer to develop high-contrast black-and-white films (such as traffic surveillance film and Kodak&#x27;s Technical Pan). This is done in order to lower the contrast. In this application, only a silver image is formed; the bleach step of the C-41 process is not used, as it would destroy the image.

<doc id="863809" wikidata="Q6908690" url="?curid=863809" title="Moosewood Restaurant">
<text>Moosewood Restaurant (January 3, 1973–present) is an American natural foods restaurant in Ithaca, New York. In 1978, the original founders sold the restaurant to the staff, who became &quot;The Moosewood Collective.&quot; In addition to producing a number of cookbooks (by the Moosewood Collective), The Moosewood Restaurant won the &quot;America&#x27;s Classics&quot; award from the James Beard Foundation in 2000, which recognized it as &quot;one of the most popular regional destinations.&quot;

==Overview==
Moosewood Restaurant was originally founded as a worker collective on January 3, 1973 during the natural foods and Farm-to-table movements within the American counterculture. According to the self-published 1974 &quot;Moosewood Cookbook&quot; (created by staff members), &quot;a group of seven people started building [Moosewood Restaurant] in the fall of 1972,&quot; and the name was inspired by Patrick, one of the original founders, &quot;who once read a book and in it was a character-a dog in fact&#x27; named Moosewood; it is also the name of a lovely striped maple tree.&quot; Its original goal was to provide dishes made of &quot;local, sustainable&quot; food. Although meat was served when the restaurant first opened, it was dropped from the menu. The focus turned to natural foods that primarily featured vegetarian (and later vegan) dishes, but has also included pescetarian options on its menu and in its cookbooks. 

It was popular with countercultural icons: &quot;Crosby and Nash once shared drinks at the bar, and Allen Ginsberg ended his dinner with a Moosewood brownie and black coffee. Even the Grateful Dead stopped by during their trip for Cornell&#x27;s Barton Hall show, only to go unrecognized by the members of the collective.&quot;

==History==

===1970s===
Moosewood was established in &quot;the ground level of the Dewitt Building at 215 N. Cayuga St,&quot; and sits &quot;[in the] southeast corner of the building [...] its décor included barn board wainscoting, fifteen wooden tables, mix-matched chairs, and tie-dyed curtains.&quot; The founders originally developed the restaurant as “a place to feed their community. The vision was to put forward ideas about sustainable farming and environmentally friendly food systems but to do so in a delicious way.&quot; It was also set up to:

Wynnie Stein, an original Moosewood member, states she became involved due to the emphasis on local ingredients: &quot;it&#x27;s important for people to know where their food was produced. I saw Moosewood&#x27;s Collective involvement in this locally sourced foods movement and I am so glad to be a part of it. It&#x27;s refreshing to be part of a group of individuals who support the use of locally produced fruits, vegetables, and grains.&quot; Stein also notes that the &quot;first people who were involved were very idealistic, none of them had any restaurant experience. They were just great cooks and they loved to cook... we were really interested in food being not just helpful or good for you, but super creative and delicious, and I think that&#x27;s what set us apart from the rest of the natural foods movement.&quot;

In 1978, the original founders sold Moosewood to the restaurant staff, now called &quot;The Moosewood Collective.&quot; David Hirsch (who joined Moosewood in 1976) recalls that there &quot;were seven original owners, and by the time I started there were only two left who were still working there. Within a couple of years we bought out the original seven owners and formed it as more of a philosophical collective, because it wasn&#x27;t a true cooperative economically. We would have meetings and try for consensus on different decisions that were important. We didn&#x27;t have a hierarchical leadership; it was more horizontal.&quot;

===New ownership (2022-present)===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the members of the collective began to explore selling Moosewood. Danica Wilcox (the daughter of Kip Wilcox, an original member of Moosewood who specialized in desserts) eventually bought it, and original Moosewood member Wynnie Stein worked with her to make the transition. 

Wilcox took over as of January 1, 2022, and has launched a new menu that will be &quot;more vegan, more local and sustainable.&quot; She also notes that while Moosewood&#x27;s &quot;menu has often included fish throughout the years – which we may reintroduce – ...our focus right now is to highlight the beautiful produce, grains, dairy and wine available in our region...the first new menu celebrates authentically vegetarian cuisine.”

In 1974, members of the original Moosewood staff self- published a spiral bound paper-covered vegetarian cookbook, with &quot;The Moosewood Cookbook Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant in the Dewitt Mall, Ithaca, New York&quot; on the title page. Page three contains a list of its creators: &quot;Design, Editing, Hand-writing, Pen-and-ink illustrations Mollie Katzen Feedback digestion, Critical Analysis, Introduction &amp; History Nancy McCauley Cover Drawing Judith M. Barringer Onion Photogram Kathy Morris Frontispiece: charcoal drawing Meredith (Mimi) Barchat Photographs Phyllis Boudreau Photographic Montage Phyllis Boudreau Susan B. Lent.&quot; In addition, page 79 contains a list of cookbooks titled &quot;Postward.&quot; The list includes titles such as &quot;Diet for a Small Planet&quot;, &quot;Great Meatless Meals&quot;, &quot;Recipes for a Small Planet&quot;, &quot;The Yogi Cookbook&quot; (Yogi Vithaldas and Susan Roberts), &quot;Ten Talents&quot;, &quot;The Vegetarian Epicure&quot;, &quot;Sunset Mexican Cookbook,&quot; and &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot;. It is preceded by the following statement:&quot;Because we have only presented our original recipes in this book, you may not have found a recipe for something you ate at Moosewood and liked. For this reason, and because we want to share our sources of inspiration with you, it is our pleasure to acknowledge our favorite cookbooks.&quot; 

===Moosewood Cookbook===
In 1977, Ten Speed Press in California published a revised version of the 1974 self-published original, with &quot;&quot;The Moosewood Cookbook Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant Ithaca, New York&quot; Compiled, Edited, Illustrated and Hand-Lettered by Mollie Katzen&quot; on the title page. Page five lists additional contributors: &quot;Frontspiece: Charcoal Drawing by Meridith Barchat Photographs by J.M. Barringer Cover Design by Meridith Barchat and Mollie Katzen.&quot; This page also contains a list of 37 names (including Katzen) introduced as: &quot;The Moosewood People who have created the Moosewood Restaurant in Ithaca, New York from which this book has sprung.&quot; 

The &quot;Moosewood Cookbook&quot; became a highly influential vegetarian cookbook, with four editions (1977, 1992, 2000, 2014).

===Moosewood Collective===
Beginning in the late 1980s, The Moosewood Collective began a cookbook series. The first, published in 1987, is titled &quot;New Recipes From Moosewood Restaurant.&quot; Mollie Katzen states in a quote on the back cover: &quot;It&#x27;s been nearly ten years since I cooked at Moosewood Restaurant, and I had no hand making this book, yet these recipes evoke memories so fresh, it feels like I worked there yesterday.&quot; &quot;New Recipes From Moosewood Restaurant&quot; has been followed by thirteen more books of vegetarian, vegan, and Pescetarian recipes to date. A share of cookbook royalties have gone to various charities: &quot;Ithaca Community Harvest, Planned Parenthood, AIDS Work of Tompkins County, Eritrean Relief Fund, Tibetan Resettlement Project, Greater Ithaca Activities Center, Loaves &amp; Fishes, and Healthy Food for All.&quot; In 2014, the Collective donated &quot;a copy of &quot;Moosewood Cooks for a Crowd&quot; cookbook to youth and adult secure facility/prisons, plus local schools, community centers and organizations, and spiritual centers throughout New York State.&quot;

In 2010, the Moosewood Collective donated its archive of original cookbook manuscripts and memorabilia to Cornell University. The papers are housed in the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in the Carl A. Kroch Library.

<doc id="863813" wikidata="Q7314229" url="?curid=863813" title="Representation theory of the Poincaré group">
<text>In mathematics, the representation theory of the [[Poincaré group]] is an example of the representation theory of a Lie group that is neither a compact group nor a semisimple group. It is fundamental in theoretical physics.

In a physical theory having Minkowski space as the underlying spacetime, the space of physical states is typically a representation of the Poincaré group. (More generally, it may be a projective representation, which amounts to a representation of the double cover of the group.)

In a classical field theory, the physical states are sections of a Poincaré-equivariant vector bundle over Minkowski space. The equivariance condition means that the group acts on the total space of the vector bundle, and the projection to Minkowski space is an equivariant map. Therefore, the Poincaré group also acts on the space of sections. Representations arising in this way (and their subquotients) are called covariant field representations, and are not usually unitary.

For a discussion of such unitary representations, see Wigner&#x27;s classification.

In quantum mechanics, the state of the system is determined by the Schrödinger equation, which is invariant under Galilean transformations. Quantum field theory is the relativistic extension of quantum mechanics, where relativistic (Lorentz/Poincaré invariant) wave equations are solved, &quot;quantized&quot;, and act on a Hilbert space composed of Fock states.

There are no finite unitary representations of the full Lorentz (and thus Poincaré) transformations due to the non-compact nature of Lorentz boosts (rotations in Minkowski space along a space and time axis). However, there are finite non-unitary indecomposable representations of the Poincaré algebra, which may be used for modelling of unstable particles.

In case of spin 1/2 particles, it is possible to find a construction that includes both a finite-dimensional representation and a scalar product preserved by this representation by associating a 4-component Dirac spinor formula_1 with each particle. These spinors transform under Lorentz transformations generated by the gamma matrices (formula_2). It can be shown that the scalar product

:formula_3

is preserved. It is not, however, positive definite, so the representation is not unitary.

<doc id="863816" wikidata="Q12068" url="?curid=863816" title="Kensington Security Slot">
<text>The Kensington Security Slot (also called a K-Slot or Kensington lock) is an anti-theft system for hardware electronics such as notebook computers, computer monitors and others. It is a small, metal-reinforced hole used for attaching a lock-and-cable apparatus. It is produced by Kensington Computer Products Group.

== Development ==
Designed in the mid 1980s and patented by Kryptonite in 1999–2000, assigned to Schlage in 2002, and since 2005 owned and marketed by Kensington Computer Products Group.

== Design ==
The system consists of a small, metal-reinforced hole found commonly on small or portable computers and electronics equipment such as laptops, computer monitors, desktop computers, video game consoles, audio interfaces, and video projectors, combined with a metal anchor attached to a rubberized metal cable secured with a key or combination lock. The end of the cable has a small loop that allows the cable to be looped around a permanent object, such as a heavy table or other similar equipment.

The hole is found in many laptops, although a lock for it is typically not included. Occasionally, the slot is located so that installing a lock will also prevent the removal of a valuable subcomponent, such as a rechargeable battery or a memory module. The Kensington slot may be marked with a small icon that looks like a padlock with a capital &quot;K&quot;, or the slot may be unlabelled.

== Efficiency ==
Kensington locks can discourage opportunistic grab-and-run thefts of equipment from public locations such as coffee shops or libraries, but they are not designed to be impervious protection measures, nor are they intended to secure equipment in unattended locations, because they can be torn out of equipment (although not without causing visible damage), given that the cases are typically made of plastic or thin metal, and the cable can be cut with wire or bolt cutters. In addition to this, successfully securing the non-locking, loop end of the cable is dependent upon the availability of a suitable anchoring point on a virtually immovable base object, or a thief may just shift that object, and then take the protected device with cable attached.

The lock mechanism is typically a tubular pin tumbler lock or, less frequently, a flat key lock or a numeric combination lock with no key.

== Alternatives ==

Several manufacturers offer similar locking mechanisms that do not require a special lock hole. They attach to a popular port, such as the VGA or printer port, and have special screws to secure locks in place.

<doc id="863822" wikidata="Q6923804" url="?curid=863822" title="Mount St. Mary's University">
<text>Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University is a private Catholic university in Emmitsburg, Maryland. It has the largest Catholic seminary in the United States. Undergraduate programs are divided between the College of Liberal Arts, the Richard J. Bolte School of Business, and the School of Natural Science and Mathematics. &quot;The Mount&quot; has over 40 undergraduate majors, minors, concentrations, and special programs, as well as bachelor&#x27;s/master&#x27;s combinations in partnership with other universities, 8 master&#x27;s programs, and 6 postgraduate certificate programs.

== History ==

Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s was founded by French émigré John DuBois, a French-born Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of New York from 1826 until his death in 1842. In 1805, DuBois bought land near Emmitsburg, Maryland on the mountain that Catholic colonists had christened &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Mountain,&quot; and laid the cornerstone for Saint-Mary&#x27;s-on-the-Hill church. Parishioners from two local congregations built a one-story, two room log cabin for DuBois, and that cabin was the first structure of Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s. The church was completed in 1807. DuBois first opened a boarding school for children. Then, in 1808, the Society of St. Sulpice closed Pigeon Hill, its preparatory seminary in Pennsylvania, and transferred all the seminarians to Emmitsburg. This marked the official beginning of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s. DuBois was appointed president of the college. Simon Bruté, whom President John Quincy Adams called &quot;the most learned man of his day in America,&quot; joined Mount St. Mary&#x27;s as teacher and vice-president in 1812. The small faculty of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s strove to offer a full high school and college course to lay students and potential priests and developed Mount St. Mary&#x27;s into &quot;one of the most important ecclesiastical institutions of the country.&quot; DuBois Hall, named for DuBois, was completed in 1826 in what had been a swampy thicket on the mountain. The first charter for a university was obtained in 1830. Until the early 1900s, Mount St. Mary&#x27;s also acted as a boarding school. Some remnants of the boarding school, such as Bradley Hall (one of the oldest buildings on campus), still exist. The Mount was known as Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s College and Seminary until June 7, 2004, when the name was changed to Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University.

=== Saint Joseph College history and merger with Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s ===

Elizabeth Ann Seton, founder of the Sisters of Charity and the first native born United States citizen to be canonized as a saint, came to Emmitsburg in 1809. She lived on the campus of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s while her own school was being built. For a while, she lived in the same log cabin that had been built for DuBois. In June 1809, Seton established Saint Joseph&#x27;s Academy and Free School for girls, the first free Catholic parochial school in the United States. This school is considered to be the foundation of the entire Catholic parochial school system in the United States. Seton wrote classroom textbooks and trained her Catholic sisters to become teachers, and accepted all students regardless of ability to pay. Saint Joseph&#x27;s Academy and Free School developed into Saint Joseph College High School (1890–1946), Saint Joseph&#x27;s High School (1946–1982), and Saint Joseph College (1902–1973), a four-year liberal arts college for women.

There was a long shared history between Saint Joseph and Mount St. Mary&#x27;s. In 1815, Seton sent several of the Sisters of Charity to manage the Infirmary at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s. As enrollment at Saint Joseph&#x27;s Academy grew in the 1800s, some professors from Mount St. Mary&#x27;s were added to the Saint Joseph&#x27;s faculty. And, since the campuses of the all-female Saint Joseph College and the all-male Mount St. Mary&#x27;s were just a couple of miles apart, the schools historically depended on each other for social life. In 1967, female students at Saint Joseph College began taking some classes at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s, and men from Mount St. Mary&#x27;s began taking some classes at Saint Joseph. In 1973, with declining enrollment numbers and rising operating costs, Saint Joseph College closed its doors and merged with Mount St. Mary&#x27;s, which has been fully co-educational since then.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

=== 2016 &quot;Drown the bunnies&quot; controversy ===

In January 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on plans by university president Simon P. Newman to use a questionnaire administered to freshman students to dismiss 20 to 25 freshmen in the first weeks of school to improve the school&#x27;s retention statistics. The questionnaire included questions about students&#x27; mental health, disabilities, and financial support. The story originally appeared in the university&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot;. Newman was quoted as saying, in response to criticism and questions from colleagues, &quot;...you think of the students as cuddly bunnies, but you can&#x27;t. You just have to drown the bunnies … put a Glock to their heads.&quot; Two professors who objected to the president&#x27;s policies were abruptly terminated without severance. One, Ed Egan, was the faculty adviser of &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot;, while the other, Thane Naberhaus, was a tenured professor who had publicly questioned the president&#x27;s actions. The two were told they were fired because they had violated &quot;a duty of loyalty&quot; to the university. University provost David Rehm also objected to the president&#x27;s plan and was asked to resign as provost but allowed to keep his faculty position. Professors throughout America protested the terminations and denounced them as retribution. Over 8,000 scholars digitally signed a petition for them to be reinstated, while organizations such as the American Association of University Professors, Student Press Law Center, and Foundation for Individual Rights in Education issued statements condemning Newman&#x27;s actions. On February 12, 2016, the Mount St. Mary&#x27;s faculty issued a resolution asking Newman to resign; on that same day, Newman announced at a faculty meeting that the two fired professors would be reinstated. On February 29, 2016, the university announced Newman&#x27;s resignation. In a statement, Newman said that he cared deeply about the university, and that the recent publicity regarding his leadership became &quot;too great of a distraction to our mission of educating students.&quot;

== Connection to Notre Dame and Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Indiana ==

French missionary Simon Bruté spent two decades as teacher and pastor in the formative years of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s. He was considered &quot;one of the foremost scholars in America,&quot; and he had a great deal of influence on the Catholic Church in America. In 1834, he was appointed the founding bishop of the Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana. In 1832, Stephen Badin of Indiana purchased 524 acres of land surrounding two lakes near South Bend, Indiana, and when he retired in 1835 he deeded the property to the Diocese of Vincennes. It was Badin&#x27;s dream that a school would be established there. Bruté visited the South Bend property and described it as &quot;a most desirable spot, and one soon I hope to be occupied by some prosperous institution.&quot; In 1836, Bruté traveled to France seeking funds and priests for his diocese, and one of the priests he recruited was Edward Sorin, the founder of Notre Dame. After Bruté&#x27;s death in 1839, his successor, Bishop Hailandière, offered the 524 acre South Bend property to Sorin for the purpose of starting a college. The school was founded in 1842 as &quot;L&#x27;Université de Notre Dame du Lac&quot; (The University of Our Lady of the Lake). and grew to become the University of Notre Dame and its sister school Saint Mary&#x27;s College.

Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s, Notre Dame, and Saint Mary&#x27;s College are each named in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with Notre Dame meaning &quot;Our Lady,&quot; a term of endearment for Mary. And each school&#x27;s motto focuses on Mary&#x27;s attribute of Catholic hope. Mount St. Mary&#x27;s: &#x27;Spes Nostra&#x27; (Our Hope), Notre Dame: &#x27;Vita Dulcedo Spes&#x27; (Life, Sweetness, Hope) and Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Indiana: &#x27;Spes Unica&#x27; (The Only/Unique Hope)

== Campuses ==

=== Main campus ===

Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University is located on a 1,400 acre campus in a rural mountain setting. Students live in five new or completely renovated residence halls. There are also three apartment buildings where seniors (and some juniors) live in fully furnished apartments complete with bathrooms and kitchens. The student center and cafeteria are located in the recently renovated McGowan center.

Academic classes are held in the Knott Academic Center, the COAD Science Building, and the Borders Learning Center. The fine arts department is located in the newly renovated Flynn Hall, now known as the Delaplaine Fine Arts Center.

Bradley Hall is the campus administration building.

The ARCC, called &quot;The Ark&quot;, is a sports and fitness complex available to students. It contains the Knott Arena, which can seat up to 5,000 people and is used for athletic events, special events and concerts on campus. On October 4, 2015, President Barack Obama spoke at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service at the Knott Arena.

==== National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes ====

Mount St. Mary&#x27;s is home to the National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, a Catholic pilgrimage site devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary that draws thousands of visitors annually. Emmitsburg.net describes the grotto as &quot;a place of pastoral beauty and spiritual inspiration ... situated high on the mountainside where nature displays itself in all its wild and picturesque glory.&quot; The sixty acres of grounds include lush gardens, a pond, rosary paths, the Stations of the Cross, devotional areas, a scenic overlook, and St. Mary&#x27;s Chapel on the Hill (also known as the Glass Chapel). Grotto water flows from taps located around a fountain pool, and chaplains are available to bless the water for visitors. John Watterson had the stone grotto cave built in 1875 as a replica of the miraculous Our Lady of Lourdes in France.

The grotto was first established on St. Mary&#x27;s Mountain in 1805 by the university&#x27;s founder, John Dubois. According to legend, DuBois was attracted to a light on the mountain and found a blessed spot and sat down at the foot of a large oak tree beside a stream. He made a cross of twigs and fixed it to the tree to be the symbol of the holy work he was undertaking. This was the original grotto. Simon Bruté was an early steward of the grotto. He created pathways throughout the grounds and attached crosses to the trees that now line the Stations of the Cross along the entrance. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton attended Sunday Mass at the Grotto chapel. The 1911 book &quot;The Story of the Mountain&quot; tells how Mother Seton would sit on her favorite rock at the Grotto and &quot;invoke the divine blessing by reciting the Canticle of the Three Children, and none that heard her could ever forget the tones of that voice and the fervor of that heart, which in the midst of the wild scenery of nature called upon all creatures to bless and magnify their Creator.&quot; Her rosary walks around the grotto were re-enacted in 2005 to celebrate its 200th anniversary.

In 1958, the grotto was refurbished and made more accessible to the public by Hugh J. Phillips, who became known as the &quot;Restorer of the Grotto.&quot; The grotto was proclaimed a Public Oratory on December 8, 1965, by Cardinal Lawrence Shehan, archbishop of Baltimore. On November 27, 2007, Bishop Jacques Perrier of the Diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes in France visited the Mount St. Mary&#x27;s Grotto and gave the gift of a stone excavated from the original grotto in Lourdes, France, in order to &quot;spiritually connect&quot; the two places.

== Student publications ==

=== &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot; ===

&quot;The Mountain Echo&quot; is a print and online newspaper that reports on news and events at the university.

The newspaper began in 1879. According to a 1993 article by William Lawbaugh in &quot;The Mountain Briefing&quot;, the first issues were printed on a hand-operated press by Professor Ernest Lagarde from his home. Early issues of the newspaper were four pages long and reported on education, sports, and significant campus events. The issues also included articles on the history of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s, poetry and literary works, death notices, alumni news, and personal and other advertisements. &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot; ceased publication after several years, but was revived on October 28, 1923, when Volume I, Number 1 was published. &quot;The Echo&quot; has been in continuous publication since then. &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot; was restructured during the academic year 1974–75, and was renamed &quot;The Mountain Review&quot;. The name was changed back to &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot; the following year. By the 1995/96 academic year, &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot; was printing a 24-page issue on a biweekly schedule. That year the newspaper expanded into two other formats. &quot;Echo Online&quot; was the first incarnation of &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot; website. And &quot;Echo Weekly News&quot; with Vince Chesney was a radio show hosted by the newspaper&#x27;s editor-in-chief on the college radio station, WMTB.

=== &quot;Tolle Lege&quot; ===

&quot;Tolle Lege&quot;, first published in 2007, is a collection of philosophy and theology essays by undergraduates and seminarians. Essays are submitted through email and then voted on by the board of student editors. The journal&#x27;s name means &quot;take up and read,&quot; and is taken from Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;.

=== &quot;Lighted Corners&quot; ===

&quot;Lighted Corners&quot;, the Mount&#x27;s literary and arts magazine, published its first issue in 1981. &quot;Lighted Corners&quot; is dedicated to art, fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, and photography. Each year near the end of the fall semester, submissions are collected through email, which are voted on anonymously by staff. The editorial board makes the final selections, and then the staff spends the spring semester editing and putting the magazine together. &quot;Lighted Corners&quot; has won many awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association (CSPA), the American Scholastic Press Association, and the Society for Collegiate Journalists. In 2017, &quot;Lighted Corners&quot; received a gold medal and All-Columbian honors from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. According to the CSPA, “All-Columbian honors have been given only when the publication has achieved the 95th percentile or higher in one or more of the three categories.”

=== &quot;Moorings&quot; ===

&quot;Moorings&quot;, the Mount&#x27;s undergraduate critical humanities journal, published its first issue in 2016.

Although &quot;Moorings&quot; has an interdisciplinary panel of faculty advisors, the journal is almost entirely student-run with its editor-in-chief position passed down among students, making it unique among the Mount&#x27;s journals. It also offers a double-blind peer review processes which both grades and edits written submissions.

<text>Punaluu Beach (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between Pāhala and Nāālehu on the Big Island of the U.S. state of Hawaii. The beach has black sand made of basalt and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
Punaluu is frequented by endangered hawksbill and green turtles, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.

==The Beach==

The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim. The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the ancient Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. In the Hawaiian language &quot;puna luu&quot; means &quot;spring [water] diver for&quot;. 
The beach is located at coordinates . Access is from the Hawaii Belt Road: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to the Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punaluu Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punaluu==
e Punaluu is the Hōkūloa Church, a Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of Henry Ōpūkahaia (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punaluu. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punaluuu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Kaiei.e. Heiau. Thought to be a fishing shrine, the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na iliili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane. The name Kaiei.e. is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous ieie vine. Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Kaiei.e. today. Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional. It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course. Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punaluu Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kaneeleele; Mailekini or Punaluu Nui. This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punaluu Bay. Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906. Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone). Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is Ala Kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Kau coast to Puna. This trail once paved with the na iliili hanau was designated as a National Historic Trail in 2029 and remnants can be found at both Punaluu Nui and Kaiei.e. heiau.

Kii pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==

Rare and endangered native animals known at Punaluu and Ninole are the honu ea (hawksbill turtle), honu (green turtle), Hawaiian monk seal, native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other anchialine pool fauna. Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered Hawaiian hawk (io) that nests in the trees at Punaluu. Spinner dolphins and humpback whales can also be sighted offshore from Punaluu. Residents say such sightings are common. A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punaluu in 2006 near the boat ramp, and most recently in April 2024, and several known nesting sites of the endangered hawksbill turtles are located along the Punaluu and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.
Hawaiian Hawksbll Project, Ka&#x27;u Preservation, Malama Punaluu. 2024

The hawksbill turtle or honu&#x27;ea (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean. Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawaii. More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawaii Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.

The threatened green turtle or honu (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punaluu. Red seaweed, a favorite food of the green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers. Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain from the turtles at all times.

The endangered Hawaiian hoary bat, opeapea, (&quot;Lasirus cinereus semotus&quot;), is known to fly over and reside at Punaluu. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet. It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects. Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (&quot;Megalagrion xanthomelas&quot;) can be found at Ninole. It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honuapo. Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwāa, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honuapo. The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marsh, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwāa Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and aā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities. In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth). Native plants such as ilima (&quot;Sida fallax&quot;), naupaka kahakai (&quot;Scaevola taccada&quot;), and pōhuehue (&quot;Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis&quot;) were found in the area.

==Wetlands==

The second largest spring complex on Hawaii Island is located at Punaluu and Ninole Cove. Stretching from Punaluu to Nīnole Springs through Kāwāa to Honupo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna. These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==

Anchialine pools of various types occur near and around Punaluu and Ninole Cove. These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea. They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves. Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks. The orange-black damselfly (&quot;Megalagrion xanthomelas&quot;) breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation. Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii&#x27;s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, non-native fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punaluu has long been known for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore. The pristine, spring fed waters of Punaluu mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punaluu still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including yellowfin tuna (ahi) and mackerel (ono, or wahoo). Historically, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked taro and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.
==Weddings &amp; Elopements==
Punaluʻu Black Sand Beach is a stunning and unique location for an elopement or intimate wedding in Hawaii. With its jet-black volcanic sand, swaying coconut palms, and frequent visits from Hawaiian green sea turtles, it offers an unforgettable setting for couples looking to say &quot;I do&quot; in a truly one-of-a-kind place.Punaluʻu Black Sand Beach Wedding Guide:

==Development==
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by C. Brewer &amp; Co. from 1969 to 1972. A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back. The project was partially built but abandoned.

In 2005, further development called &quot;Sea Mountain&quot; of about and up to 2000 residential units was proposed by a company based in Beverly Hills, California. An environmental impact statement was developed in 2006. Despite the involvement of Jean-Michel Cousteau, this development met local opposition.

==Popular culture==
In the 1960s, Japanese actor and guitarist Yūzō Kayama composed a surf rock tune called &quot;Black Sand Beach&quot;. This song has since been played by Yūzō Kayama and Launchers, Takeshi Terauchi and Blue Jeans, The Ventures, and The Aquatudes.

<text>Ange (, ) is a French progressive rock band formed in September 1969 by the Décamps brothers, Francis (keyboards) and Christian (vocals, accordion, acoustic guitar and keyboards).

Since its inception the band&#x27;s music has been inspired by medieval texts and fantasy.

==History==

Ange was initially influenced by Procol Harum and King Crimson, and their music was quite theatrical and poetic. Their first success in France was the cover of a Jacques Brel song, &quot;Ces gens-là&quot;, on their second album &quot;Le Cimetière des Arlequins&quot;. The band provided its first concert on January 30, 1970, at the cultural center &quot;La Pépinière&quot;, in Belfort, France. They performed 110 concerts in England from 1973 to 1976, opening for Genesis at the Reading Festival in England, on August 26, 1973, fronting some 30.000 listeners.

One of the reasons for which the band was unable to break through into the British market was because they sang in French. Ange eventually released an English-speaking version of its fifth album &quot;Par les fils de Mandrin&quot; (&quot;By the sons of Mandrin&quot;), which was hard to find and sold poorly, although this version has since been made available on CD. Unfortunately, after three albums, the quality of creation had started to decrease, and &quot;Par les fils de Mandrin&quot; was probably not a good choice to try to break into the British market.

Following &quot;Par les fils de Mandrin&quot; and the live double album &quot;Tome VI&quot;, the band issued a mellotron–centered album, &quot;Guet-apens&quot;, and then had a more rock-oriented change of direction, although various progressive reformations occurred over the years, e.g. for the 1992 album &quot;Les larmes du Dalaï-Lama&quot;. Sponsored by the French radio RTL, Ange relentlessly toured until the end of 1977, welcoming an average of 5,000 to 6,000 listeners per show. During their first years (generally regarded as the best ones), the other three members of the band were Jean-Michel Brézovar on guitar and flute, Gérard Jelsch on drums, and Daniel Haas on bass (and acoustic guitar). In 1995, Ange played their farewell tour.

Christian Décamps released a few albums as &quot;Christian Décamps et Fils&quot; (&quot;Christian Décamps and Son&quot;), before taking over the name &quot;Ange&quot; in 1999, and is backed by his band for his solo albums. The new lineup has issued several albums from &quot;La voiture à eau&quot; in 1999, performed on 2006 edition of NEARfest and was still on the road in 2013.

Francis Décamps and Jean-Michel Brézovar have also released solo albums.

==Keyboards==
The keyboard sounds of the &#x27;70s-era band, while reminiscent of a mellotron, were in fact generated from a Viscount organ through a modded Hammond reverb. However, an actual mellotron was played on the album &quot;Par Les Fils De Mandrin&quot; in 1976.

<doc id="863848" wikidata="Q3330679" url="?curid=863848" title="Arab American National Museum">
<text>The Arab American National Museum (AANM, ) is a museum in Dearborn, Michigan, highlighting the history, experiences, and contributions of Arab Americans. Established in 2005, it is the first, and largest, museum in the world devoted to Arab American history and culture. It is a division of the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS), and a Smithsonian Affiliate.

== History ==
The museum&#x27;s roots lie in an arts and culture division established by parent organization ACCESS in the 1980s. A small museum soon opened in the organization&#x27;s headquarters, but by the late 1990s, they sought to establish a larger, standalone museum; as such, a fundraising campaign was launched in 2000 to fund the construction of a new museum. Following the September 11 attacks, the community saw a more urgent need to tell their story and dispel myths about Arab Americans.

The museum, located on Michigan Avenue in Dearborn&#x27;s East Downtown, opened to the public on May 5, 2005. Construction cost $15 million, funded largely by donations; major donors included Chrysler, General Motors, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

In February 2019, the leader of ACCESS announced Diana Abouali as the new director of the AANM.

== Exhibits ==

The museum&#x27;s first floor explores the history and contributions of ancient Arab civilization such as science, medicine, mathematics, architecture, and the decorative arts. The second floor focuses on the Arab experience in America, with galleries dedicated to migration, everyday life and culture, and prominent Arab-Americans such as Ralph Nader and Helen Thomas. Documents and artifacts from Arab Americans related to immigration and the immigration process are displayed, and stories of Arab Americans are portrayed in video or audio recordings.

The AANM also includes two large gallery spaces for temporary art exhibits.

=== Permanent art collection ===
Complementing its regular lineup of solo and group exhibitions of art from the Arab world and its American diaspora, the museum holds a permanent collection of paintings, drawings, sculpture, photography, and installation art, displayed throughout the museum. Artists represented in this collection include Emily Jacir, Julienne Jabara Johnson, Mary Tuma, Sama Alshaibi, Hani Zurob, Helen Zughaib, John Halaka, Samia Halaby, Kamal Boullata, Doris Bittar, Sumayyah Samaha, Afaf Zurayk, Leila Kubba Kawash, Athir Shayota, Wafer Shayota, and Adnan Charara.

== Programs and events==
MOVE is a first-of-its-kind national gathering that provides a space for artists, activists, scholars, philanthropists, organizations and others from the Arab American community to connect, learn and exchange ideas. &quot;MOVE 2017,&quot; produced by ACCESS and its three national institutions – the Arab American National Museum, the National Network for Arab American Communities (NNAAC) and the Center for Arab American Philanthropy (CAAP) – will &quot;Mobilize&quot;, &quot;Organize&quot;, &quot;Vocalize&quot;, and &quot;Empower&quot; attendees as they explore intersectionality in a safe environment and have critical conversations about a wide range of issues impacting Arab Americans. DIWAN: A Forum for the Arts is now a part of MOVE. DIWAN unites Arab American artists, scholars and performers representing myriad academic fields and artistic genres for a weekend dialogue that reinforces the AANM&#x27;s commitment to providing a place for community members and artists to meet, exchange ideas and exhibit their work. Notable presenters at the 2009 DIWAN conference include writer Najla Said, poet Suheir Hammad, artist Wafaa Bilal, and poet Remi Kanazi.

Global Fridays is a periodic music program at the AANM that promotes World Music. Though Global Fridays is held at the Arab American National Museum the music is a diverse mix from Mexican American roots music to Chinese Classical and Rock.

Arab Film Festival is an annual film festival put on by the AANM that showcases a number of Arab and Arab American films over a weekend. Past festivals have celebrated the career of a particular Arab filmmaker or director. The 2008 Arab Film Festival honored the work of Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine and showed his films &quot;The Cairo Station&quot; and &quot;The Destiny&quot;. The festival also features short films such as &quot;Kemo Sabe&quot; the story of Yussef, a six-year-old Arab-American boy who dreams of being the Cowboy instead of the Indian on the playground.

The Arab American Book Award was established in 2006 to celebrate and support the research of and the written work of Arab Americans and their culture. The Arab American Book Award encourages the publication and excellence of books that preserve and advance the understanding, knowledge, and resources of the Arab American community by celebrating the thoughts and lives of Arab Americans. The purpose of the Award is to inspire authors, educate readers and foster a respect and understanding of the Arab American culture.

<text>Lisa Marie Eilbacher (born May 5, 1956) is a retired American actress. She is best known for her role as Jeanette Summers in the Beverly Hills Cop film in 1984.

She is married to director and photographer Bradford May since 1988.

==Early life==
Lisa Marie Eilbacher was born in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the daughter of an American oil company executive. She was raised in France.

Her two siblings are also actors: sister Cindy Eilbacher and brother Bobby Eilbacher. 

==Career==

=== Child actress and tv roles ===
Eilbacher started acting as a child, appearing on such shows as &quot;My Three Sons&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. She later made a transition into adult roles on such shows as &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;.

Eilbacher starred as Callie Shaw in &quot;The Hardy Boys Mysteries&quot; in 1977. The same year she appeared in the episode &quot;The Innocent&quot; of the short-lived &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; TV series. She also guest starred on the TV series &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; in an episode where she played Shakespeare&#x27;s Juliet. She also appeared in the 1974 television movie &quot;Bad Ronald.&quot;

=== Subsequent roles and films ===
In 1981, she starred in the television film &quot;This House Possessed&quot; with Parker Stevenson, with whom she worked on &quot;The Hardy Boys Mysteries&quot;.

That year she acted in Lee Philips&#x27;s film &quot;On the Right Track&quot; starring television star Gary Coleman. Some reviews concluded that it was sappy and capitalizing on Coleman&#x27;s TV following, many found the film charming, well written, and well acted. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; felt she stood out by saying it &quot;is Coleman&#x27;s picture, but its unexpected pleasure is Eilbacher&quot;.

Eilbacher is best known for her roles in two 1980s films: &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. In &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, she played Naval Aviation Officer Candidate Casey Seeger, a popular and charming woman who nearly flunked out of the program due to her inability to complete the obstacle course; however, she persevered and graduated. An amateur bodybuilder in real life, Eilbacher said the hardest aspect of this role was &quot;pretending&quot; to be out of shape. In &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, she played Jenny Summers, a childhood friend of Eddie Murphy&#x27;s character who reunited with him to solve the murder of a mutual friend.

Eilbacher was also featured in the 1983 miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot;, playing Madeleine Henry.

In 1985, she co-starred with Holland Taylor in the ABC detective series &quot;Me and Mom&quot;.

<doc id="863853" wikidata="Q6241894" url="?curid=863853" title="John Joel Glanton">
<text>John Joel Glanton (c. 1819 – April 23, 1850) was an early settler of Arkansas Territory. He was also a Texas Ranger and a soldier in the Mexican–American War and the leader of a notorious gang of scalp-hunters in Northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States during the mid-19th century. Contemporary sources also describe him as a murderous outlaw and prominent participant in the Texas Revolution. He appears as a violent figure in the works of the prominent Western writers Larry McMurtry and Cormac McCarthy.

==Biography==
===Early life===
John Joel Glanton was born with his twin, Julian, in Edgefield County, South Carolina, in 1819. His father Charles William Glanton (17891826) died while he was young, and his mother, Margaret Hill Glanton, relocated her four sons to Louisiana. In 1832, she remarried to MajorJohn Roddy, a wealthy South Carolinian veteran of the War of 1812, eventually bearing two children by him. In 1835, she followed him to Jackson County in the Arkansas Territory, where the family established Walnut Woods, a plantation with more than twenty slaves near what is now Augusta.

===Texan Independence===
Little is certain about Glanton&#x27;s youth, but he developed a reputation for explosive violence. He appears in few records until his 1841 arrest in Louisiana but later authors state he fled Tennessee as an outlaw before settling in Gonzales, Texas and taking part in the first battle of the 1835 Texian Revolution against Mexico&#x27;s Centralist Republic. His fiancée was abducted, scalped, and killed by Lipan Apaches before or during his time with Stephen F. Austin at the siege of De Cos&#x27;s forces in San Antonio. He was said to have been a scout under Col.James Fannin, commissioned as a captain of the Texas Rangers while still 16, and to have narrowly escaped De La Portilla&#x27;s March 27, 1836 massacre of Fannin&#x27;s men at Goliad. After the Battle of San Jacinto, President Sam Houston supposedly banished Glanton from Texas, although this was never enforced and no record of such an order survives. He was later said to have wounded or killed the best men on both sides of the Regulator–Moderator War without supporting either side himself.

Glanton was arrested in New Orleans on March 11, 1841 for assault, having tried to shoot a police officer with his pistol in the American Theatre, but he was dismissed with little or no punishment, since no one was hurt. In early 1843, Glanton applied for a 320-acre grant of land in Jackson County, Arkansas. He improved the land but, receiving no certificate of purchase, he transferred his claim to his brother Benjamin in 1845 and returned to Louisiana. He was still receiving his mail in New Orleans in September 1846 but had apparently already left for Texas.

===Mexican–American War===
By the time of the Mexican–American War, he was part of Walter P. Lane&#x27;s San Antonio company of Texas Rangers. Contemporary sources charged him with killing a Mexican civilian in Magdalena, New Mexico, while serving as a perimeter sentry in 1847. Glanton defended himself, saying the civilian had ignored his commands to halt. This event brought Walter P. Lanethen a major in the armyinto conflict with his general Zachary Taylor. Glanton evaded the military police sent to arrest him but then enlisted in John Coffee Hays&#x27;s second regiment of the First Texas Mounted Rifles, also informally known as the Texan Rangers. He saw action as part of Gen. Winfield Scott&#x27;s Mexico City campaign, during which Private Glanton was noted by Gen.Joseph Lane to have &quot;attracted general notice for his extraordinary activity and daring throughout the actions both of the 23d and 24th&quot; Nov. 1847 at Galaxara Pass in Puebla.

=== Glanton organization ===
After the summer of 1849, Glanton and his employees were hired by Mexican authorities to eliminate Apaches in northern Mexico and what is now part of the Southwestern United States. For increased income, their organization scalped Native war tribes who had been attacking settlers in America and Mexico to claim the bounty for scalps. The soldier and memoirist Samuel Chamberlain claimed he worked as a member of the organization. According to Chamberlain, Glanton&#x27;s second-in-command was a Texian known as Judge Holden. Reneging on their contracts, the state of Chihuahua put a bounty on the heads of the organization, declaring them outlaws in December 1849. Chihuahuan authorities drove them out to Sonora. Eventually they wore out their Sonoran welcome and moved north into the Arizona territory.

===Glanton Massacre===
In Arizona the Glanton organization became partners in a ferry at the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River, a popular crossing for settlers and prospectors traveling to and from California during the California Gold Rush. According to claims from competing ferry operators, the Glantons sometimes killed Mexican and American passengers returning from the gold-fields to take their money and goods. Other accounts claim they destroyed a boat and killed some Quechans operating a rival ferry near Pilot Knob. At dawn on April 23, 1850, a band of Quechans led by &quot;Caballo en Pelo&quot; killed and scalped Glanton and most of his organization to establish the tribe&#x27;s ferry monopoly. Hearing of the massacre, California officials recruited a militia in the ill-fated Gila Expedition against the Quechan tribe.

==In popular culture==

* Jeremiah Clemens includes Glanton as a character in his novel &quot;Bernard Lile&quot; (1856), one of the earliest fictional works concerning the Texas Revolution.
* Samuel Chamberlain, who claimed to have been a member of the gang, wrote an account of their activities in his memoir: &quot;My Confession&quot;.
* Glanton, under the name Gallantin, is a character in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot; (1982), an installment in the long-running &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot; series of comic novels.
* A fictionalized version of Glanton and his gang is featured prominently in Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; (1985), many of the events of which are based on Chamberlain&#x27;s account.
* Glanton, along with another historical scalp hunter, James Kirker, appears briefly in the opening scenes of Larry McMurtry&#x27;s novel &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1995). The book is the first volume of McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; tetralogy.
* The seven-page story &quot;A Scalp for a Scalp&quot;, drawn by Russ Heath and written by John Whalen, also based on Chamberlain&#x27;s memoir, is included in &quot;The Big Book of the Weird Wild West&quot; published by Paradox Press in 1998.
* Hugues Micol&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Scalp: La Chevauchée funèbre de John Glanton et de ses compagnons de carnage&quot;, based on Chamberlain&#x27;s book, was published in 2017 by the French publisher Futuropolis.
* A 2005 episode of the History Channel series &quot;Wild West Tech&quot; featured an account of the Glanton Gang, focusing on Glanton&#x27;s misdeeds as a scalp hunter. These scenes were filmed at Old Tucson Studios near Tucson, Arizona.
* In Kevin Costner&#x27;s film &quot;&quot; (2024) there is a subplot that is based upon the Glanton gang.

<text>The Norwich Terrier is a breed of dog originating in England, and was bred to hunt small rodents. One of the smallest terriers, these dogs are relatively rare. Their drop-eared variety is the Norfolk Terrier.

== Description ==
===Appearance===
These terriers are one of the smallest working terriers weighing approximately and ideally not being above at the withers, with prick ears and a double coat, which comes in all shades of red, tan, wheaten, black and tan, and grizzle. The skull is broad and slightly rounded with a well defined stop. The muzzle ratio to the head is 2:3. The eyes are small and oval-shaped. Ears are usually erect — but can be laid back when the dog is calm — and set apart with good width between them. The tips are pointed. The back is short with good depth and a well sprung loin. Legs are short with the elbows being more proximal than distal. Tail is of moderate length when not docked, thick at the base with tapering near the top. Tail should be &#x27;carried jauntily&#x27; and &#x27;not excessively gay&#x27;. The American Kennel Club standard calls for a &#x27;medium docked&#x27; tail with enough of the tail being left on so that it can be held or grabbed.
===Temperament===
Occasionally, this breed will display barking and digging behaviours, which are reflective of their terrier heritage. Consistent and early training can help manage these habits.

==Health==
A study in the UK found a life expectancy of 14 years for the Norwich Terrier.

A US study of over 90,000 dogs found the Norwich Terrier to be the second most predisposed breed to portosystemic shunt with 7.41% of dogs being affected compared to 0.35% for mixed-breed dogs.

A retrospective study on cataracts using patient records from North American hospitals found a prevalence of 4.02% for the Norwich Terrier compared to 1.61% for mixed-breed dogs.

===Breathing issues===
Some Norwich Terriers suffer from an upper respiratory obstructive syndrome that differs from brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome. In a study of 12 dogs with signs of the condition 11 had abnormalities of the laryngeal opening with redundant aryepiglottic folds, laryngeal collapse, everted laryngeal saccules, and a narrowed laryngeal opening all being observed in multiple dogs.

A 2019 study found that some Norwich terriers suffering from respiratory tract disorders shared a mutated variant of gene &quot;ADAMTS3&quot; that is typically associated with swelling around the airways. Dogs with two copies scored worse on airway-function tests. Breeders hope to employ genetic testing to minimize the mutation being passed down.
===Labour complications===
A questionnaire identified the Norwich Terrier as requiring more than half of all bitches to undergo caesarean section to give birth. The questionnaire also found more than a fifth of all Norwich Terrier pups to be stillborn. A UK based questionnaire identified a rate of caesarean section of 36.6%.

==Population==

In 2018, both Norfolk and Norwich terriers appeared on the Kennel Club&#x27;s list of most vulnerable dog breeds, with the Norwich breed having fewer than 300 births per year.

==History==
===Origin===
Fox hunting terriers resembling the Norwich have been described since the 19th century.

Two extinct breeds are often suggested as being the ancestor of the Norwich Terrier: the Cantab terrier and the Trumpington terrier.

====Cantab terrier====
In the 1880s a dog dealer, Charles Lawrence became well known amongst the undergraduates of Cambridge University. One student wrote of him: &#x27;Everybody knew him, nobody believed him yet his margin of profit must have been considerable...&#x27;. Lawrence hailed from nearby Chesterton and bred terriers from Irish Terriers, Yorkshire Terriers, and an East Anglian red terriers (colloquially known as &#x27;gypsy dogs&#x27;), he developed a ratter that also made for a good companion for students. These dogs became known as cantab terriers.

====Trumpington terrier====
After his graduation from Cambridge in 1889, E. Jodrell Hopkins opened a livery stable on Trumpington Street, he kept and bred terriers here and they became known as Trumpington terriers. These dogs gained popularity in Norwich and Leicestershire before Hopkins moved away to Newmarket. Hopkins started with breeding a dark brindle Aberdeen-type Scottish Terrier bitch he inherited from a war recruit to a cantab terrier that had a longer and harsher red coat. From this paring came a rough-coated dog that was primarily red named Rags and a darker and smaller bitch named Nell. Hopkins kept Nell and sent Rags to J. E. Cooke, master of a pack of staghounds in Norwich. Cooke bred Rags to multiple sporting terriers belonging to different townsfolk and all of the puppies had red coats. Hopkins bred Nell and her dam to a dog he had purchased named Jack, a cropped ear, sandy coated terrier. The offspring from this pairing had either red or grizzle coats.

====Frank Jones====
Frank Jones came from County Wicklow and by 1901 was working as the whip in the Norwich staghounds. Jones eventually quit his job and moved to Market Harborough, he brought terriers sired by Rags into the town to work as ratters. He chose to name these terriers after the town he had left. He favoured erect ears, and whole coloured red or black and tan terriers without any white. World War I led to a decrease in his terrier numbers; however Jones kept breeding and by 1930 there was a dedicated breed club trying to achieve recognition with the Kennel Club. Jones did not wish for formal recognition or the idea of a show standard. In 1956 he attended a show and decried the modern Norwich claiming his dogs were no larger than the Yorkshire Terrier and saying he did not care about any so-called &#x27;improvements&#x27;. Frank&#x27;s dogs would be imported to the US in the early 20th century and were known as &#x27;Jones Terrier&#x27;

===Breed recognition===
In 1932, thanks to the effort of Mrs D. Normandy-Rodwell a group of 13 Norwich Terrier owners formed the first breed club. There was debate within the group about the ideal breed standard and despite it being forbidden by the Kennel Club several members would crop the ears of their terriers who lacked erect ears. Despite the Kennel Club chairman A. Croxton Smith stating that restricting to one ear type would cause difficulties and a breeder known as Colonel Gell saying: &#x27;in this vascillating ear regulation, the Norwich Terrier Club is laying up for itself, trouble in the future.&#x27; the president of the Norwich Terrier Club — Jack Read — refused to allow black and ten and drop eared dogs into the draft standard. Normandy-Rodwell who was the secretary believed that the dogs should only be &#x27;brilliantly orange&#x27; and that only erect ears should be allowed. Eventually Read conceded and allowed black and tan dogs, although he refused to allow any with white markings. In 1935 Read resigned from his role as president after the first breed standard came out due it to including both black and tan and dropped ears.

===Breed separation===
For more than 30 years Marion Sheila Scott Macfie tried to promote the drop-eared variety of the Norwich Terrier as a separate and distinct breed to the Norwich Terrier. She repeatedly took her dogs to shows which grew their popularity and during World War II she sent over two pairs of dogs to the US. As the Norwich began to be shown more and more often Macfie grew to resent the fact that erect eared dogs would win far more often than the drop eared variety. In 1957 she fought to make drop ears be considered equal but the Kennel Club rejected her arguments. Seven years later she achieved separate recognition of the drop eared variety as the Norfolk Terrier.

Both ear types continued to be allowed in the ring until The Kennel Club recognized the drop-eared variety as a separate breed, the Norfolk Terrier, in 1964, and the American Kennel Club, United Kennel Club, and Canadian Kennel Club did the same in 1979. Until that time, the breeds were designated by the AKC as Norwich Terriers, P.E. (prick ears) and Norwich Terriers, D.E. (drop ears).

<text>Artes mechanicae (mechanical arts) are a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills, often juxtaposed to the traditional seven liberal arts (&quot;artes liberales&quot;). Also called &quot;servile&quot; and &quot;vulgar&quot;, from antiquity they had been deemed &quot;unbecoming&quot; for a free man, as they minister to basic needs.

==Overview==
Johannes Scotus Eriugena (9th century) divided them into seven parts: 
* (tailoring, weaving)
* (agriculture)
* (architecture, masonry)
* and (warfare and hunting, military education, &quot;martial arts&quot;)
* (trade)
* (cooking)
* (blacksmithing, metallurgy)

In his &quot;Didascalicon&quot;, Hugh of St Victor (12th century) includes navigation, medicine and theatrical arts instead of commerce, agriculture and cooking. Hugh&#x27;s treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity, a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals.

The classification of the as applied geometry was introduced to Western Europe by Dominicus Gundissalinus (12th century) under the influence of his readings in Arabic scholarship.

In the 19th century, &quot;mechanic arts&quot; referred to some of the fields that are now known as engineering. Use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the performing arts and the fine arts, which were for the upper class of the time, and the intelligentsia. The mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families.

Related phrases, &quot;useful arts&quot; or &quot;applied arts&quot; probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general.

In the United States, the most famous usage of the term &quot;mechanic arts&quot; (and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today) is in the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act.

<text>The Liberal Party of the Philippines () abbreviated as the LP, is a liberal political party in the Philippines.

Founded on January 19, 1946 by Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, and José Avelino from the breakaway liberal wing of the old Nacionalista Party (NP), the Liberal Party remains the second-oldest active political party in the Philippines after the NP, and the oldest continually active party. The LP served as the governing party of four Philippine presidents: Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, Diosdado Macapagal, and Benigno Aquino III.

As a vocal opposition party to the dictatorship of their former member Ferdinand Marcos, it reemerged as a major political party after the People Power Revolution and the establishment of the Fifth Republic. It subsequently served as a senior member of President Corazon Aquino&#x27;s UNIDO coalition. Upon Corazon Aquino&#x27;s death in 2009, the party regained popularity, winning the 2010 Philippine presidential election under Benigno Aquino III and returning it to government to serve from 2010 to 2016. This was the only instance the party had won the presidency since the end of the Marcos dictatorship, however, as it lost control of the office to Rodrigo Duterte of PDP–Laban in the 2016 presidential election and became the leading opposition party once again. Its vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo won in the same election, however, narrowly beating the second candidate by a small margin.

The Liberal Party was the political party of the immediate past Vice President of the Philippines. In the 2019 midterm elections, the party remained the primary opposition party of the Philippines, holding three seats in the Senate. The LP was the largest party outside of Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s supermajority, holding 18 seats in the House of Representatives after 2019. In local government, the party held two provincial governorships and five vice governorships. The general election of 2022, however, was a setback for the party, which lost both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency, as well as all of its seats in the Senate, and saw its representation in the House of Representatives reduced.

The Liberal Party remains an influential organization in contemporary Philippine politics. With moderately progressive positions on social issues and centrist positions on economic issues, it is commonly associated with the post-revolution, liberal-democratic status quo of the Philippines in contrast to authoritarianism, conservatism, and socialism. Aside from presidents, the party has been led by liberal thinkers and politicians including Benigno Aquino Jr., Jovito Salonga, Raul Daza, Florencio Abad, Franklin Drilon, and Mar Roxas. Two of its members, Corazon Aquino and Leila de Lima, have received the prestigious Prize For Freedom, one of the highest international awards for liberal and democratic politicians since 1985 given by Liberal International. The Liberal Party is a member of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats and Liberal International.

==History==
=== Third Republic ===

==== 1946 elections: The Rise of Manuel Roxas ====
The Liberal Party started as the &quot;Liberal Wing&quot; of the Nacionalista Party, led by Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino. The Liberal Wing is formed due to intention of Roxas to run as president for the presidential election which he, and his supporters called and lobbied to the United States Congress to be early. When President Sergio Osmeña was officially selected as Nacionalista presidential nominee, Roxas and Quirino officially founded the &quot;Liberal Wing&quot; into Liberal Party in January 19, 1946. Roxas and Quirino where the party&#x27;s presidential and vice presidential nominee respectively, and became victorious over the administration ticket of Osmeña and Amang Rodriguez. After their presidential election performance, they dominated the House elections won the majority of 49 seats, and the senate race in 1947 winning six over eight seats.

==== 1948: Quirino succeeds Roxas, but facing impeachment attempt ====
After the death of President Roxas in April 15, 1948 at Clark Air Base, Pampanga, due to multiple heart attacks, Elpidio Quirino assumed the presidency.

Riding on the crest of the growing wave of resentment against the Liberal Party, a move was next hatched to indict President Quirino himself. 

A committee of seven members of the House of Representatives, led by Congressman Agripino Escareal, drafted a five-count complaint that ranged from exorbitant spending to nepotism. A seven-member committee led by Representative Lorenzo Sumulong was created by Speaker Eugenio Pérez to investigate the charges before they were submitted to the Senate, serving as an impeachment body. Felix Angelo Bautista, the Solicitor General, arrived as the top executive&#x27;s defense attorney. Following several hearings, on April 19, 1949, after a rather turbulent session that lasted all night, the congressional committee reached a verdict completely exonerating the President.

==== 1949 elections: Quirino reelected ====
For the 1949 elections, Quirino got the nomination of the party, while Jose Avelino, the senate leader of the party ran under his own wing of the party. Quirino choose Fernando Lopez as vice presidential nominee while Avelino selected Senator Vicente Francisco. Qurino and Lopez won the election over Nacionalista&#x27;s Jose P. Laurel (who is the president of the Japanese puppet-Republic) and Manuel Briones, and Avelino and Francisco. But the said election is considered as one of the dirtiest, with violence and fraud taking place. As the news reports said that opponent&#x27;s supporters are either beaten up by Quirino&#x27;s supporters or the local police. In the Senate, they swept out the whole 8 member ticket, while still maintaining majority at the House.

==== 1953 elections: Magsaysay out, Liberal stumbled ====
For the 1953 elections, Liberal stalwart named Ramon Magsaysay, who has been recruited by founding member Roxas to fulfill the party with fresh names, wants to snap the presidential nomination of the party. But Quirino has still plans for re-election. Another Liberal also wants to challenge Quirino as the presidential nominee, the country&#x27;s representative to the United Nations Carlos P. Romulo. Quirino officially selected by the party, with José Yulo as his running-mate, because Lopez will join Romulo and his supporter&#x27;s walk-out march out of the party. Magsaysay jumped to Nacionalista and got the party&#x27;s nomination over one of its stalwarts Senate President Camilo Osías (who also jumped to Liberal with Jose Zulueta), in April 12, 1953. Romulo and Lopez founded the Democratic Party in May 29, 1953, with the two founders selected as their presidential and vice presidential nominee. But later, the two cancelled their candidacy and supported Magsaysay&#x27;s candidacy.

Quirino&#x27;s campaign was bombarded by controversies and issues, like with one of party&#x27;s member named Negros Occidental Governor Rafael Lacson, a corrupt politician who killed Moises Padilla, his challenger in 1951 elections, and friend of Magsaysay which popularized by a photograph taken with Magsaysay carrying Padilla&#x27;s dead body, and also being used by the latter in his campaign. Another issues like he allegedly own a golden arinola, corruption and nepotism, being out of touch to the mass due to his lavish lifestyle, and unresolving the Huk rebellion. Magsaysay and his running mate Carlos Garcia won the election via landslide. In the senate, the whole Liberal slate was kicked out in the Magic 8, thus not winning any seats, while in the House they only won 31 seats. In 1955 Senate elections, no Liberal again won any seat in the Senate.

==== 1957 elections: Rise of Diosdado Macapagal ====
After the death of Magsaysay, and succession of Garcia, Liberal fielded their former 1953 Vice Presidential nominee José Yulo, with Kapampangan 1st district Congressman Diosdado Macapagal as his running mate for the 1953 presidential elections. In a four-way race, Yulo lost to incumbent Garcia, but Macapagal managed to defeat former House Speaker Pepito Laurel. For the first time in electoral history of the Philippines, the winning president did not have a vice president who came from the same party.

==== 1961 elections: Liberal prevailed ====
For the 1961 elections, Ilocano Senator Ferdinand Marcos wants to gain the nomination of the party to challenge Garcia&#x27;s re-election bid, but Vice President Macapagal also wants to be the nominee of the party. Later, In January 1961, Marcos and Macapagal agreed that the latter will be the presidential nominee, while Marcos will be the new party president replacing Macapagal. Macapagal promised that he will only run for one term, and Marcos will be the nominee in after his term. Macapagal will challenge Garcia, choosing young Senator Emmanuel Pelaez. The two managed to defeat the administration ticket of Garcia and Senator Gil Puyat. 

==== Stonehill Scandal ====

In 1962, a bribery scandal shocked the whole country which involves some of Liberal Party members, including President Macapagal, and then-Senate President Marcos. Those bribed money are from a businessman named Harry Stonehill, a former military officer of the United States who settled in the Philippines to make business. But, after an argument with Meinhart Spielman, the general manager of his Philippine Tobacco Corporation, he made Spielman suffered physically and the latter revealed to the Senate a &quot;blue book&quot; that listed all of the Filipino politicians bribed. But while Justice Secretary Jose &quot;Pepe&quot; Diokno investigated the scandal, Macapagal ordered the deportation of Stonehill, but the president&#x27;s trust rating still plummeting. Diokno later run for senate under Nacionalista banner.

==== 1965 elections: Broken promise, Marcos out ====
After Diosdado Macapagal&#x27;s announcement of plan for re-election in 1965, Marcos, like what Magsaysay did, jumped into Nacionalista Party by April 1964, and selected as its presidential nominee. Meanwhile, Macapagal selected Gerardo Roxas, son of the founder to be his running-mate. The campaign of Macapagal and Roxas focused against Marcos&#x27; false military medals. The two failed to defeat Marcos, and his running mate Fernando Lopez, who is the Vice President under Quirino, and also a former Liberal. 

==== 1967 elections: Rise of Ninoy Aquino ====
In 1967 elections, the only one from the Liberal slate was elected from the 8 senate seats contested is Ninoy Aquino, a former Nacionalista who is known for being an associate of Ramon Magsaysay. Aquino managed to gather 49.52% of the votes. 

==== 1969 elections: Dirty elections faced ====
For the 1969 elections, Liberal will field Serging Osmeña, son of the Nacionalista founder Sergio Osmeña as their presidential nominee. Osmeña ran for vice presidency in 1961 as an independent and placed second. The party also recruited Magsaysay&#x27;s brother Genaro to be his running-mate. Both of them lost to the incumbents, but the election year was considered as one of the dirtiest elections in history, like 1949. 

==== 1971: The Plaza Miranda bombing ====
After what happened to Plaza Miranda bombing, Liberal won five seats. Also in Manila mayoral election, two Liberal faced, in the named of Ramon Bagatsing and Antonio Villegas. Bagatsing later won the mayoral election.

=== Martial law and Fourth Republic era ===

==== Being threat to Marcos ====
During the days leading to his declaration of martial law, Marcos would find his old party as a potent roadblock to his quest for one-man rule. Led by Ninoy Aquino, Gerry Roxas and Jovito Salonga, the LP would hound President Marcos on issues like human rights and the curtailment of freedoms. Even after Marcos&#x27; declaration of martial law silenced the LP, the party continued to oppose the regime, and many of its leaders and members would be prosecuted and even killed during this time. 

==== 1978 elections ====
For the incoming 1978 parliamentary elections, some Liberal members joined the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, a regime-controlled coalition, while others joined Ninoy Aquino&#x27;s Lakas ng Bayan (LABAN). With many preferring not to be involved, the &quot;Liberal&quot; went to hibernation, but the party became more liberal during this era.

==== 1981 boycott ====
After Marcos lifted Martial Law with &quot;Proclamation 2045&quot;, on January 17, 1981, Liberal joined United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO), the main coalition of the opposition. But UNIDO and LABAN declared a boycott due to Marcos did not accept the demand of UNIDO like to clean the voters&#x27; list, revamping of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), and accreditation of UNIDO as the minority. This caused for Marcos to be reportedly dismayed as he could not legitimize the election without a viable opposition candidate. 

==== 1986 snap elections ====
Liberal stalwarts joined UNIDO with Nacionalista, and PDP-Laban members, they supported the candidacy of Cory Aquino and Doy Laurel for the 1986 election. In the said election, violence was rampant and cheating scandals and controversies arose, with COMELEC officers walked out of the PICC, the place where COMELEC transmission of data happens. The election victory of Marcos prompted People Power Revolution in February 25 of the same year.

=== Post-EDSA &amp; Fifth Republic ===

==== Under Aquino Administration ====
After democracy was restored after the People Power Revolution, some of the Liberal stalwarts was instrumental in ending more than half a century of US military presence in the Philippines with its campaign in the 1991 senate to reject a new RP-US Bases Treaty. This ironically cost the party dearly, losing for it the elections of 1992.

==== 1992 elections ====
The Liberal Party and the PDP-Laban formed a coalition named Koalisyong Pambansa, it also supported the candidacy of Jovito Salonga, as president and Nene Pimentel as vice president for the 1992. But both of them lost to Aquino&#x27;s preferred candidate and Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, and Senator Joseph Estrada.

==== 1995 elections ====
The Liberal Party won 5 seats in the House elections. But the party did not have any senatorial candidate.

==== 1998 elections: Alfredo Lim ====
In 1998, Liberal fielded Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim as their presidential candidate, with Serge Osmeña as his running mate. Serge Osmeña is the son of the party&#x27;s former presidential nominee. The two is supported by former president Corazon Aquino. But the tandem lost to Vice President Joseph Estrada and Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, daughter of their 1961 presidential nominee respectively.

==== EDSA Dos ====
In 2000, it was in opposition to the Estrada administration, actively supporting the Resign-Impeach-Oust initiatives that led to People Power II. 

==== 2001: People Power Coalition ====
After Estrada being kicked out of the Presidency, Liberal joined the administration&#x27;s People Power Coalition for the 2001 elections, with former Quezon City councilor Kiko Pangilinan and former Senator Bobby Tañada as the party&#x27;s senatorial candidate. Among the two, Pangilinan only managed to win, placing 8th with 10,971,896 votes.

==== 2004: K-4 and Rise of Mar Roxas ====
For the 2004 elections, Liberal joined the K-4 coalition of President Arroyo, with former Congressman and Gerry Roxas&#x27; son Mar and Senator Rodolfo Biazon are the candidates of the Liberal. Both of them won, with Roxas placed 2nd, while Biazon placed 12th. Biazon&#x27;s victory was protested by 13th placer Senator Robert Barbers (who is also a K-4 member), but the case filed by Barbers later dismissed.

==== 2007 elections: GO and Noynoy ====
After the revelation that Arroyo cheated in the presidential elections, many Liberal members who are part of the cabinet of Arroyo resigned in 2005, thus joining the opposition. For the 2007 elections, Liberal fielded a candidate, the son of Ninoy and Cory, Tarlac Congressman Noynoy Aquino. Kiko Pangilinan also ran for re-election in senate, but as an independent and still under Liberal. Aquino managed to win the senate elections, placing 6th and Pangilinan placed 5th.

==== Drilon-Roxas wing vs Atienza wing ====
On March 2, 1998, some Liberal members installed Manila Mayor Lito Atienza as the party president, which triggered an LP leadership struggle and party schism.

Liberal met on November 27, 2007, to decide who would succeed Franklin Drilon as the party president and to hold an election for his replacement. Both Noynoy Aquino and his Senate colleague Mar Roxas received nominations, but Aquino emerged victorious as the party&#x27;s president, while Roxas is set to be the presidential nominee. The former chairman and head of the &quot;Atienza faction&quot; or &quot;Pro-Arroyo faction,&quot; DENR secretary Lito Atienza, congratulated him, but he later condemned the election and referred to Drilon and his supporters as a &quot;merry cabal of destabilizers&quot;. He added that the other group had disregarded the Supreme Court&#x27;s injunction to maintain the status quo. Later, Supreme Court recognized the Drilon Wing as the sole legitimate wing of the Liberal Party.

==== 2010: Benigno &quot;Noynoy&quot; Aquino III administration ====
The Liberal Party regained influence when it nominated as its next presidential candidate then-Senator Benigno Aquino III, the son of former President Corazon Aquino, for the 2010 Philippine presidential election after the latter&#x27;s death that subsequently showed a groundswell of support for his candidacy. Even though the party had earlier nominated Mar Roxas to be its presidential candidate for the 2010 Philippine general election, Roxas gave way to Aquino and instead ran for vice president. The party was able to field new members breaking away from the then-ruling party Lakas–Kampi–CMD, becoming the largest minority party in Congress. Aquino would later win by plurality, and Liberal would become the majority party in Congress.

But, some incidents like the appointment of party president Jun Abaya and mismanagement of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) cost the party&#x27;s next presidential elections. 

==== 2016 elections: Oras Na, Roxas Na! ====
In the 2016 presidential elections, the Liberal Party nominated Mar Roxas, former Department of Transportation and Communications (DoTC) and Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) secretary, and Leni Robredo, a representative from Naga City and widow of Jesse Robredo, the DILG secretary who preceded Roxas, as the party&#x27;s presidential and vice presidential candidates. Robredo won, while Roxas lost. Most of the party&#x27;s members either switched allegiance to PDP–Laban, joined a supermajority alliance but retained their Liberal membership (with some defecting later), joined the &quot;recognized minority&quot;, or created an opposition bloc called &quot;Magnificent 7&quot;.

==== Post-2016 elections ====
After its loss in the 2016 elections, as early as February 2017, the leaders of the Liberal Party chose to focus on rebuilding the party by inviting sectoral representation of non-politicians in its membership numbers. Since then the party had been inducting new members who were non-politicians, some of whom applied online through the party&#x27;s website.

==== 2019 elections: Otso Diretso ====
Before the scheduled 2019 general elections, the Liberal formed Otso Diretso, an electoral coalition of eight candidates for the senate race; led by the party, the coalition field also comprised members of the Magdalo Party-List, Akbayan Citizens Action Party, and Aksyon Demokratiko. None of the eight senatorial candidates under Otso Diretso won a seat, however; it was the first time in the history of the current bicameral composition of the Philippine Congress under the 1987 Constitution that the opposition failed to win a seat in one of the chambers, and the second time that a Liberal Party-led coalition suffered a great loss since 1955.

==== 2022: Leni Robredo&#x27;s presidential campaign ====
For the 2022 Philippine presidential election, the Liberal Party nominated Leni Robredo and Francis Pangilinan for the presidential and vice presidential posts, respectively. The party led the Team Robredo–Pangilinan alliance, which included incumbent senator De Lima, other members of the Liberal Party, and several guest candidates from other parties such as Akbayan, as well as independents. Robredo ran as an independent candidate whilst remaining affiliated with Liberal Party. Both candidates lost the election to Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte, respectively, finishing second. While some candidates from the Liberal Party-led alliance were elected, no candidate from the party won a seat in the senatorial elections, for the first time since the 1995 elections.

==== 2025: KiBam and Mamamayang Liberal ====
In 2024, members of the Liberal Party formed a sectoral wing called Mamamayang Liberal (ML) for the 2025 House of Representatives elections for party-list seats. De Lima, who was released from detainment in November 2023, was selected as ML&#x27;s first nominee. Former senator and vice presidential candidate Kiko Pangilinan will be the Liberal Party&#x27;s sole candidate for the senatorial elections. Pangilinan and Liberal will form a coalition with Katipunan ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino to form a coaltion duo with Bam Aquino for the 2025 senate election.

== Ideology ==
While the Liberal Party defines its ideology as social liberalism, the party has often been described as a &quot;centrist&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; party. Historically, the Liberal Party has been evaluated as a &quot;conservative&quot; party, with an ideology similar to or indistinguishable from the Nacionalista Party&#x27;s ideology, until it became the opposition party under the Marcos dictatorship, wherein it became more liberal. Being a founding member of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats and a full member of Liberal International, the Liberal Party advocates the values of &quot;freedom, justice and solidarity (&quot;bayanihan&quot;),&quot; as described in the party&#x27;s values charter. Although this may be deemed theoretically true since the party&#x27;s founding in 1946, it became more tangible through the party&#x27;s position of continuing dissent during the Marcos dictatorship.

Since 2017, the party has opened party membership to the general public and to key sectors of society, aiming to harness a large volunteering base. According to the party, this aims to ostensibly build on &quot;the promise of becoming a true people&#x27;s party&quot;.

=== Symbols ===
The Liberal Party is associated with the color yellow, a political color commonly associated with liberalism. During the People Power Revolution, opposition parties against the Marcos dictatorship, including the Liberal Party, used yellow ribbons as a symbol of resistance and support for Ninoy Aquino, one of the leading politicians against the regime. The color would later be co-opted by his son, Benigno Aquino III, as well as the LP, for his presidential campaign in 2010, which he later won.

After his presidency, yellow continued to be associated with the party, which became the leading opposition party against president Rodrigo Duterte. The pejorative term &quot;&quot; (), associated with the liberal elite, has been used against the party and other critics of the Duterte administration. In an effort to distance herself from the negative connotations of the color and unite various opposition groups, then party chair Leni Robredo adopted the color pink for her presidential campaign. Both pink and yellow are currently used by the party.

== Current political positions ==
The party has declared policies geared toward inclusiveness and people empowerment. It also advocates and supports secure jobs, food, shelter, universal health care, public education access, and other social services, and is against extrajudicial killings, any challenge to the rule of law, and curtailments of human rights strictures. The party also aims to form an open government with participatory democracy, positions that have been supported by the party&#x27;s recent leaders.

===Economic policy===

* Impose 1% wealth tax on individuals with net value assets exceeding ₱1 billion.
* Create tax exemptions for selected products.

* Increase minimum wages.

== Legal issues ==
Senator Leila de Lima, who led an investigation into alleged extrajudicial deaths in the early months of Duterte&#x27;s war on drugs, was issued an arrest warrant in 2017 based on charges linked to the New Bilibid Prison drug trafficking scandal, which the party claimed was based on trumped-up charges, labelling the arrest &quot;patently illegal&quot;. While on the whole, de Lima&#x27;s investigation was seen by some pundits as an adversarial investigation that was a strategic mistake, others in the party simply saw it as a call to a review of the party&#x27;s principles and how members have adhered to them.

Senator De Lima has been fully acquitted of all criminal charges on June 24, 2024, marking the end of her legal battle and detention that lasted over six years. De Lima, a prominent critic of former President Rodrigo Duterte, described the charges as politically motivated to silence her investigations into Duterte&#x27;s controversial drug war and alleged human rights abuses.

In 2019, the party, along with other groups, was accused of planning a coup against the Duterte government. The party denounced the allegation and called it a state-sponsored threat of legal abuse, demanding the government provide evidence to back the claims. 

== Liberal presidents ==

As of 2024, there have been a total of 4 Liberal presidents. Those who won presidency under other parties are not included.

<doc id="863888" wikidata="Q6302549" url="?curid=863888" title="Judge Holden">
<text>Judge Holden is a fictional character from the novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; by Cormac McCarthy, and is based on a historical person who partnered with John Joel Glanton as a professional scalp-hunter in Mexico and the American Southwest during the mid-19th century. To date, the only source for Holden&#x27;s character in &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; is from Samuel Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;My Confession: Recollections of a Rogue&quot;, an autobiographical account of Chamberlain&#x27;s life as a soldier during the Mexican–American War. Chamberlain described Holden as the most ruthless of the roving band of mercenaries led by Glanton, with whom Chamberlain had traveled briefly after the war: &quot;[he] had a fleshy frame, [and] a dull tallow colored face destitute of hair and all expression&quot;; &quot;a man of gigantic size&quot;; &quot;by far the best educated man in northern Mexico&quot;; &quot;in short another Admirable Crichton, and with all an arrant coward&quot;.

Chamberlain disliked Holden intensely: &quot;I hated him at first sight, and he knew it,&quot; Chamberlain wrote. &quot;Yet nothing could be more gentle and kind than his deportment towards me; he would often seek conversation with me.&quot;

He was popularized as the main antagonist of &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; (1985), where he is described as &quot;a massive, hairless, albino man who excels in shooting, languages, horsemanship, dancing, music, drawing, diplomacy, science and anything else he seems to put his mind to. Despite his almost infinite knowledge, which he can use to achieve anything he desires, Holden favours a life of murder and hate... He is also the chief proponent and philosopher of the Glanton gang’s lawless warfare.&quot; Judge Holden has been described as &quot;perhaps the most haunting character in all of American literature&quot;.

==Historical basis==
In Samuel Chamberlain&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;My Confession&quot;, he describes Holden:

The second in command, now left in charge of the camp, was a man of gigantic size who rejoiced in the name of Holden, called “Judge” Holden of Texas. Who or what he was no one knew but a cooler blooded villain never went unhung; he stood six feet six in his moccasins, had a large fleshy frame, a dull tallow colored face destitute of hair and all expression. But when a quarrel took place and blood shed, his hog-like eyes would gleam with a sullen ferocity worthy of the countenance of a fiend. His desires was blood and women, and terrible stories were circulated in camp of horrid crimes committed by him when bearing another name, in the Cherokee nation and Texas; and before we left Fronteras a little girl of ten years was found in the chapperal, foully violated and murdered. The mark of a huge hand on her little throat pointed him out as the ravisher as no other man had such a hand, but though all suspected, no one charged him with the crime.

Holden was by far the best educated man in northern Mexico; he conversed with all in their own language, spoke in several Indian lingos, at a fandango would take the Harp or the Guitar from the hands of the musicians and charm all with his wonderful performance and out-waltz any poblana of the ball. He was “plum center” with a rifle or revolver, a daring horseman, acquainted with the nature of all the strange plants and their botanical names, great in geology and mineralogy, in short another Admirable Crichton [sc., the 16th-century Scottish prodigy and polymath], and with all an arrant coward.

Not but that he possessed enough courage to fight Indians and Mexicans or anyone else where he had the advantage in strength, skill, and weapons. But where the combat would be equal, he would avoid it if possible. I hated him at first sight and he knew it, yet nothing could be more gentle and kind than his deportment towards me; he would often seek conversation with me and speak of Massachusetts and to my astonishment I found he knew more about Boston than I did.
Some amateur historians have interpreted the name &quot;Judge Holden&quot; as a pseudonym, and hoped to establish his true identity. Popular candidates include Charles Wilkins Webber, an educated man in the region who once used the pseudonym &quot;Holden&quot;, and John Allen Veatch, a geologist who operated in the region and who led a scalp-hunting party into Mexico.

==&quot;Blood Meridian&quot;==

A fictionalized Holden is a central character in Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s 1985 Western novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;. In the novel, he and Glanton are the leaders of a pack of nomadic criminals who rob, rape, torture, and kill across the borderlands between the United States and Mexico. Throughout the novel, Holden brutally murders dozens of people, including children. Searching for additional evidence for Holden&#x27;s existence has been a hobby for some Cormac McCarthy scholars.

As depicted in &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;, Holden is a mysterious figure, a cold-blooded killer, and, it is implied, a pedophile; aside from the children he openly kills, he is seen enticing children with sweets, and a child often goes missing when he is in the vicinity. At one point in the novel, he is seen naked with a naked 12-year-old girl in his room. Holden displays knowledge of paleontology, archaeology, linguistics, law, draftsmanship, geology, chemistry, prestidigitation, and philosophy.

He is described as nearly tall and completely lacking body hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes. He is massive in frame, enormously strong, an excellent musician and dancer, a fine draftsman, exceptionally articulate and persuasive in several languages, and an unerring marksman. His skin is so pale as to have almost no pigment. This strange appearance, as well as his keen, extremely fast reflexes, strength, agility, apparent immunity to sleep and aging, and multifarious other abilities point to his being something other than a normal human. In the final pages of the novel, McCarthy makes more direct reference to the Judge as a supernatural entity, or even as a concept personified.

In 2002, &quot;Book&quot; magazine rated Holden as the 43rd greatest character in fiction since 1900. He is regarded as one of the greatest characters of modern literature, likened to a &quot;Captain Ahab of the desert.&quot; Harold Bloom described him as &quot;short of Moby Dick, the most monstrous apparition in all of American literature.&quot; Holden has been characterized as &quot;the most haunting character in American literature.&quot;

===Scholarly debate===
In his essay &quot;Gravers False and True: &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; as Gnostic Tragedy&quot;, literature professor Leo Daugherty argued that McCarthy&#x27;s Holden is—or at least embodies—a gnostic archon (a kind of demon). Harold Bloom, who declared Judge Holden to be &quot;the most frightening figure in all of American literature&quot;, even came to regard him as immortal. However, unlike Daugherty, Bloom argues that Holden defies identification as being under any &quot;system&quot; such as Gnosticism, citing the passage in the book stating that there was no &quot;system by which to divide [him] back into his origins&quot;. Rather, Bloom &quot;resort[s]&quot; to literary comparison with William Shakespeare&#x27;s Iago, a methodical dispenser of strife.

<text>The Mayor of the City of Jerusalem is head of the executive branch of the political system in Jerusalem. The mayor&#x27;s office administers all city services, public property, most public agencies, and enforces all city and state laws within Jerusalem. The term of office is five years. 

The mayor&#x27;s office is located in Safra Square; it has jurisdiction over all the city&#x27;s neighborhoods. The mayor appoints many officials, including deputy mayors and city departments directors.

==History==
The Jerusalem City Council was established in 1863 during the rule of the Ottoman Empire. From 1948 to 1967 two municipalities operated in the city: an Israeli municipality provided services to the western neighborhoods of the city and a Jordanian municipality to its eastern parts.

By 1840, the Jewish community constituted the largest single religious group in the city. From the 1880s onward, the Jews constituted the majority within the city. However, it was only in 1937, under the British Mandate, that the first Jewish mayor was appointed. Since 1948 every mayor has been Jewish.

Prior to a 1975 national law change, mayors were chosen by the city council (which was elected in a closed list proportional representation system).

Since 1975 law change, mayors have been directly elected in a two round system. Under this system, if no candidate receives at least 40% of the vote in the first round, a runoff election is held between the top-two finishers. The first municipal election to be held under the new law of direct elections for mayor was held in 1978.

==List of mayors (1845–present)==
===Ottoman Empire (1845–1920)===
===Mandatory Palestine (1920–1948)===
===Divided Jerusalem (1948–1967)===
===Reunited Jerusalem (1967–present)===
===Titular Mayors of East Jerusalem (1967–present)===

The office of Mayor of East Jerusalem was dissolved in 1967 after the Six-Day War and it has been titular since then.

<doc id="863901" wikidata="Q1550863" url="?curid=863901" title="Simca 1307">
<text>The Simca 1307 is a large family car produced by Chrysler Europe and subsequently PSA Peugeot Citroën from 1975 to 1986. Codenamed &#x27;C6&#x27; in development, the car was styled in the United Kingdom by Roy Axe and his team at Whitley, and the car was engineered by Simca at Poissy in France.

A modern, front-wheel drive hatchback, it was one of the earliest such cars in the class along with the Renault 20, Renault 30 and Volkswagen Passat, and became the 1976 European Car of the Year. It had been in development since 1972.

The model was marketed variously as the Simca 1308 and 1309 models (with larger engines), Chrysler Alpine (UK, Ireland and New Zealand), Dodge Alpine (Colombia), Chrysler 150 (Spanish market), and later Talbot 1510 / Talbot Alpine / Talbot 150 (a facelifted version launched by PSA after its takeover of Chrysler Europe) and Talbot Solara (the saloon version).

==History==
Originally the car was powered by 1294 cc and 1442  cc versions of the &quot;Poissy engine&quot; with electronic ignition and a four-speed gearbox. From launch it was available in three trim levels: GL, S and GT. Equipment levels were high, with the later GLS version featuring central door locking and electric windows, accessories that up until then had only generally featured in larger more upmarket cars. Having won the Car of the Year award, it was initially a success both at home and in the export. Production levels shot up from a daily 400 at introduction in September 1975 to 850 in December of that year, to 1100 a day in late 1976. The 1307 (7 CV) had the smaller engine, while the 1308 (8 CV) received the larger version. Unlike the other models, the more sporting 1307 S received twin Weber carburettors in continental European markets to provide a more powerful and revvy engine while remaining in a lower tax category. In the UK, the 1307 S has the same single Solex carburettor as the GL.

More upmarket models were designated 1308 (1508 in some markets, reflecting the size of the engine) and 1309 (similarly sold as a 1609 in a few markets). All of the models replaced the Simca 1301/1501 range in France, while on the British market it was sold alongside the ageing Hillman Hunter, a rear-wheel drive range of saloons and estates which would continue until 1979. This type of car was generally more popular in Britain in 1975, with the best-selling cars in this sector being the Ford Cortina and Morris Marina. The Chrysler Alpine was first sold in Britain in January 1976, going on sale just after the similar-sized Vauxhall Cavalier, a rear-wheel drive saloon which consistently outsold it.

Styled by Roy Axe, the Simca 1307, along with the recently introduced Volkswagen Passat, was one of several full-size European family hatchback inspired by the Renault 16 that had defined the sector back in 1965. In the 1970s the most popular mid-size cars in Europe were still traditional sedans like Ford Taunus (Ford Cortina in Britain), Opel Ascona B (Vauxhall Cavalier) and Morris Marina, and indeed it would be the next generations of those competing vehicles (the Ford Sierra and the Ascona C) before the concept became fully accepted in the mainstream.

Near the end of the original model&#x27;s run, the Italian importer marketed a sporty and luxurious version of the bigger-engined 1308 GT. Called the &quot;1308 GLS Superstrada&quot;, it featured alloy wheels, black striped along the lower flanks, and all chrome (aside from the pentastar logo) was blacked out.

===Facelift and Solara===
For 1980 the car, which was now sold under the Talbot-brand, received an extensive facelift. The new model, shown at the Frankfurt Show, was known as the Talbot 1510 (the Talbot Alpine name was used in the UK). It received new front and rear lights and the new top of the range SX featured alloy wheels, cruise control, headlamp wash/wipe, power steering and trip computer. Automatic transmission and a five-speed gearbox also became available. The lineup became clearer, with the 1307 GLS replaced by the 1510 LS, the 1307 S by the GL, the 1308 GT by the GLS, and finally the 1309 SX by the 1510 SX (automatic transmission only at first).

A four-door saloon version, called the Talbot Solara, was released in the same year, with either 1.3 or 1.6 engines, and was produced alongside the hatchback version. Trim levels were similar to the Alpine. It effectively took over from the Hunter, axed a year earlier, as the four-door large family saloon in the range. In the Benelux countries, a well-equipped &quot;Ultra&quot; special edition with metallic paint, alloy wheels, and velour interior appeared in December 1983.

French manufacturing of 1510, Alpine and Solara, along with the smaller Horizon, ended in 1986. In the United Kingdom, the last cars were rebadged as the Rapier and Minx which were badged depending on trim level rather than body style. Production of the Alpine, Solara and Horizon models had already finished at Ryton in the autumn of 1985 to make way for the Peugeot 309. The names were sourced from the corporate ancestor of Chrysler Europe, the Rootes Group, having been used on the Sunbeam Rapier and Hillman Minx. Supply of these models was limited and in 1986 production ceased, with the Talbot marque being shelved soon afterwards on all passenger vehicles. Thus, the Alpine/1510/Solara series was not directly replaced; however, the Citroën BX (already released in 1982) and the forthcoming Peugeot 405 (launched in late 1987) were effectively its &quot;de facto&quot; successors as PSA&#x27;s entries in the D-segment. Both of these cars were very successful in Europe and helped Citroën and Peugeot increase their market share in the UK and many other export markets.

In early 1985, with the end of production nearing, Finnish assemblers Saab-Valmet began offering the Talbot 1510 GLD, using PSA&#x27;s 1.9-liter XUD9 diesel engine with . This was the only diesel-engined version of the Simca 1307 ever offered; PSA&#x27;s Spanish branch had worked on such a model but work was never completed due to internal competition from the 305 and BX. Valmet did not offer the Solara with the diesel engine so as to avoid competing in-house with the 305 Diesel, as they were both saloons.

Whilst the 1307 sold in big numbers in France, the Chrysler Alpine did not fulfil its potential in the UK, initially losing out to contemporaries such as the Ford Cortina/Sierra and the Vauxhall Cavalier primarily due to the lack of larger engines (Ford and Vauxhall offered 2.0L engines in their products, whilst the Alpine/Solara range topped out at a 1.6L unit). The Alpine&#x27;s OHV Simca engines were particularly &quot;tappety&quot; and unrefined compared to the more modern overhead camshaft units of its rivals which further dented its appeal. In more recent years, due to corrosion problems similar to those of the Horizon few Alpines have survived in the UK. As of 2017, there were only 19 examples (including the later Talbot-badged versions) still licensed on British roads. However, the car has fared better in its native France, where it still has a cult following among Simca enthusiasts and many hundreds are still in service.

The body styling of the Simca 1307 was the direct inspiration for the design of Russian Moskvitch Aleko (1986–2001)

==Manufacture==
The car was originally manufactured in Poissy in France, in Ryton in the United Kingdom, from 1977 in Villaverde by Barreiros, a subsidiary of Chrysler Europe in Spain, and assembled from CKD kits by Todd Motors (later Mitsubishi Motors NZ) in New Zealand between 1977 and 1984. It was also assembled in Colombia as Dodge Alpine between 1978 and 1982 at the Chrysler Colmotores plant in Bogotá. Between 1979 and 1985 the car was also built by Saab-Valmet in Uusikaupunki factory in Finland. Saab-Valmet was only interested in building the smaller Horizon, but Simca-Talbot would only license that car if Valmet also agreed to assemble the larger 1307. The Finnish-made cars gradually introduced some local changes, including the option of a diesel engine, and featured many Saab interior parts. The most visible Saab-parts were the seats, which began to use Saab&#x27;s internal structure at the time that the Talbot name replaced Simca. This change also allowed for the fitment of a heated driver&#x27;s seat, which was not originally available. Talbot did not allow Valmet to export any Finnish-built cars; they were only meant for local sales.

In New Zealand, Chrysler, Talbot, Alpine, and 1510 badges were used on the car during its lifetime, though it was officially in price lists as an Alpine, following the UK convention. In 1982 the car was facelifted and renamed &quot;Talbot SX&quot; there.

<doc id="863906" wikidata="Q686228" url="?curid=863906" title="National Liberal Party (Romania)">
<text>The National Liberal Party () is a Christian democratic and socially conservative political party in Romania. As of late 2024, it is the country&#x27;s third largest political party overall. Re-founded in mid January 1990, shortly after the Revolution of 1989 which culminated in the fall of communism in Romania, it claims the legacy of the major political party of the same name, active between 1875 and 1947 in the Kingdom of Romania. Based on this historical legacy, it often presents itself as the first formally constituted political party in the country and the oldest of its kind from the family of European liberal parties as well.

== Recent historical overview ==

Until 2014, the PNL was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). The party statutes adopted in June 2014 dropped any reference to international affiliation, consequently most of its MEPs joined the European People&#x27;s Party Group (EPP) in the European Parliament.

On 12 September 2014, it was admitted as a full member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), and subsequently merged with the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL). The party was also a member of the Liberal International (LI) before switching to Centrist Democrat International (CDI). Currently, it is the second-largest party in the Romanian Parliament, with 79 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 36 in the Senate, behind the Social Democratic Party (PSD). Additionally, the party currently has the largest number of MEPs in the European Parliament on behalf of Romania (more specifically 10 out of 33).

At local political level, the PNL has been very closely associated with either the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania (FDGR/DFDR), more specifically in parts of Banat and Transylvania, or, formerly, with the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚCD), in southern Romania.

After it won the 2020 local elections, the PNL became the first political party in Transylvania, Banat, and Bukovina, establishing new political alliances at national level with, most notably, USR PLUS shortly thereafter. Moreover, as of mid 2023, the PNL also holds the largest amount of incumbent county councillors and local councillors nationwide, making it, in these regards, the most influential political party in Romania at local level. Nonetheless, concerning the total amount of mayors, the PNL comes second behind the PSD.

During late 2021, the PNL broke the alliance with USR PLUS (now simply legally known as USR) and continued under former party president Cîțu a minority government alongside the Hungarian minority-oriented UDMR/RMDSZ (with the support of President Klaus Iohannis), consequently causing the three month-long 2021 Romanian political crisis, until successfully negotiating with their historical nominal adversaries PSD in early November 2021 a grand coalition government between themselves and the UDMR/RMDSZ (known as the National Coalition for Romania or CNR for short), thereby leading to the formation of the Ciucă cabinet led by Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă.

In mid June 2023, Ciucă resigned as part of the coalition protocol previously agreed between the PNL and PSD and let Marcel Ciolacu (current PSD leader) become the incumbent Prime Minister of Romania. In the meantime, the UDMR/RMDSZ was also taken out of government and thereby rejected from the composition of the current Ciolacu Cabinet in which PNL is still the second party. Furthermore, the share of governmental power between the PSD and PNL is even between the two constituent political parties of the incumbent Ciolacu Cabinet (or the second CNR cabinet).

== History ==

=== Re-foundation and first governing experiences (1990–2000) ===


The National Liberal Party of Romania (PNL) was re-founded in January 1990, a few days after the end of the violent Romanian Revolution. During the early 1990s, the party primarily revolved around the presidencies of Radu Câmpeanu and Mircea Ionescu-Quintus, both former members of the historical PNL and liberal youth leaders during the interwar period as well as during and shortly after World War II.

At the 1990 general elections, the PNL became the third largest party in the Parliament of Romania and its then re-founding leader, Radu Câmpeanu, finished second in the same year&#x27;s presidential elections, with 10.6% of the cast votes, behind Ion Iliescu. In December 1990, the Socialist Liberal Party (PSL) led by Niculae Cerveni established an alliance with the PNL and the latter became vice-president of the PNL led by Câmpeanu at that time.

Shortly afterwards, at the main request and most notably alongside the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚCD), but to a lesser extent also with other smaller center-right parties and NGOs, the PNL managed to form the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR) in an effort to assemble a stronger collective opposition and alternative governing body to then ruling National Salvation Front (FSN), which was, in many ways, the heir of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). However, prior to the 1992 general elections, Câmpeanu decided to withdraw the party from the CDR electoral alliance and instead compete as a stand-alone political force. One of the main reasons for doing so was Câmpeanu&#x27;s reluctance for the PNL to run on common lists with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ).

This had ultimately proven to be an eventual major strategic error for the PNL, as the party did not manage to surpass the needed electoral threshold for parliamentary presence and as such was forced to enter extra-parliamentary opposition for the period 1992–1996. Furthermore, this political decision also resulted in several splinter factions leaving the main party, with some PNL deflecting groups opting to remain within the CDR while others still endorsing Câmpeanu&#x27;s side in a new party which was called PNL-C (). Therefore, the factions which deflected from the main PNL and aligned themselves with the CDR were PNL-CD (led by Niculae Cerveni), PNL-AT, and PL &#x27;93. Other minor liberal political parties such as PAC and UFD (which later merged into the main PNL) were also part of the CDR throughout the late 1990s.

Nevertheless, after a change of leadership that saw Ionescu-Quintus as the new party leader elected in 1995, the PNL contested the 1996 general election once again as part of the CDR. The 1996 general elections represented the first peaceful transition of power in post-1989 Romania, with the PNL, PNȚCD, Democratic Party (PD), and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ) forming a grand coalition that pushed the PDSR (formerly the FSN and FDSN) in opposition for the period 1996–2000. Furthermore, the presidency was also won by the CDR&#x27;s common candidate, more specifically Emil Constantinescu, who received endorsement on behalf of all of the alliance&#x27;s constituent parties (including the PNL political groups therein).

=== Opposition and second governing experiences (2000–2010) ===

Between 1996 and 2000, because of the lack of political coherence within the parties of the governing CDR coalition and the multiple changes of cabinets that followed throughout this entire period of time, the PNL decided once more to withdraw from the alliance just before the 2000 general election and, consequently, to compete alone instead. This time, the party managed to gain parliamentary presence but failed to form another centre-right government, finishing fourth in the legislative elections and third in the presidential election. However, a splinter group founded by Dan Amedeo Lăzărescu and led by Decebal Traian Remeș which was called PNL-T () decided to remain within CDR 2000 and contest that year&#x27;s general election by endorsing Mugur Isărescu as presidential candidate.

Therefore, during the mid 2000s (more specifically starting in 2003), the PNL joined forces with the PD in order to form the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) so as to compete in the 2004 general election as an alternative to the then ruling PSD (formerly PDSR) government. The alliance managed to finish second by popular vote in the Parliament, subsequently form a centre-right cabinet, and also win the presidency during the same year.

Until April 2007, the PNL was the largest member of the governing Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), which enjoyed a parliamentary majority due to an alliance between the PNL, PD, the Conservative Party (PC), and the UDMR/RMDSZ. In April 2007, then PNL Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, who was also the party president, formed a minority government solely with the UDMR/RMDSZ and the remainder PD ministers were reshuffled. This caused internal opposition within the party and led to the scission of a splinter group which turned into a political party under Theodor Stolojan, more specifically the Liberal Democratic Party (PLD), eventually merging with the PD to form the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL).

After the 2008 legislative election, the party placed third and entered official opposition, winning 19.74% seats in the Parliament, while the new grand coalition, formed by their former enlarged ally, the Democrat Liberals (PDL) and the Social Democratic Party (PSD), obtained roughly 70% together. At the 2009 presidential election, the National Liberal Party&#x27;s then newly elected leader, Crin Antonescu, finished third in the first round and the party would still find itself in parliamentary opposition for the three next years to come up until the accession of the Social Liberal Union (USL) to governance in mid 2012.

At the same time, Klaus Iohannis, at that time solely FDGR/DFDR president, was nominated twice by the PNL (along with their most sturdy and powerful allies, the PSD and the PC) in 2009, but was rejected by then state president Traian Băsescu.

=== Transition from USL to ACL and third governing experiences (2010–2020) ===

On 5 February 2011, the PNL formed the Social Liberal Union (USL) political alliance with the PSD, the National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR), and the Conservative Party (PC). The PNL subsequently exited the USL on 25 February 2014, disbanding the alliance and returning to opposition. On 26 May 2014, following the 2014 European elections, then PNL party president Crin Antonescu announced he was seeking membership within the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). At the beginning of the 8th European Parliament, 5 of the PNL MEPs sat with the EPP Group, and 1 with the ALDE Group, who later became an independent MEP within ALDE. In late May 2014, the party agreed to a future merger with the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL), with the two parties main short-time goal being to submit a joint candidate for the upcoming presidential election. The PNL-PDL presidential candidate was agreed to run under an electoral banner called the Christian Liberal Alliance (ACL).

On 27 June 2014, former PNL chairman Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu announced his intention to found a separate liberal party to run for president, stating opposition to the upcoming merger with the PDL. The breakaway party, called the Liberal Reformist Party (PLR), was founded by Popescu-Tăriceanu on 3 July 2014. On 17 July 2014, it was announced that the future merger of the PNL and PDL would retain the National Liberal Party name, while being situated in the PDL&#x27;s existing headquarters in Bucharest, and would be legally registered by the end of 2014. On 26 July 2014, a joint party congress of the PNL and PDL approved the merger.

In the first round of the 2014 presidential election on 2 November 2014, ACL presidential candidate Klaus Iohannis, PNL party president and Mayor of Sibiu was the runner-up. Iohannis won the runoff election held on 16 November 2014 with 54.5% of the total number of votes. At the 2016 local elections and legislative elections, the PNL managed to finish second, behind the PSD, and consequently in continuous opposition until 2019 when it regained executive power.

Regarding the 2019 presidential election, the party previously announced its formal endorsement for a second term of incumbent state president Klaus Iohannis in March 2018 along with an official designation of Ludovic Orban, former party president, for the position of Prime Minister should the PNL win the 2020 legislative elections. In June 2018, at an open air press conference in his native Sibiu, Iohannis publicly announced his intention to run for a second presidential term.

The year 2019 saw two minor parties adhering to the PNL, namely the PND (led by Daniel Fenechiu) and PACT (led by Sebastian Burduja), thereby increasing its total number of members. In late 2019, the National Liberal Party acceded to governance under a minority stand-alone government led by Orban which was voted twice by the Parliament (under, most notably, a confidence and supply agreement with USR and PMP as well as most ethnic minority parties, including most importantly the FDGR/DFDR). At national level, the greatest two challenges that the Orban cabinet tried to monitor, control, and solve were the COVID-19 pandemic as well as its affiliated recession.

=== Brief alliance with USR PLUS and fourth governing experiences (2020–present) ===

The PNL ran in several electoral alliances with the 2020 USR-PLUS Alliance for the 2020 Romanian local elections, winning the mayor of Bucharest (along with several of the capital&#x27;s sectors) as well as many other municipalities throughout the countryside. Shortly thereafter, the PNL decided to form local alliances with, most notably, USR PLUS, PMP, and FDGR/DFDR (as well as with two local branches of the PNȚCD and UDMR/RMDSZ in Hunedoara County). After the 2020 Romanian legislative election, the party agreed to form a coalition government alongside USR PLUS and UDMR/RMDSZ in order to reportedly provide a stable governance for the next 4 years in Romania.

Furthermore, incumbent party president Ludovic Orban decided to step down as prime minister in early December 2020, letting Nicolae Ciucă acting until the new coalition received the confidence vote in the Parliament after the 2020 legislative elections concluded with concrete, positive results on behalf of a future center-right government. Subsequently, the newly proposed prime minister on behalf of the PNL was Florin Cîțu, who previously served as the Minister of Public Finance in both Orban cabinets between 2019 and 2020. Therefore, Cîțu took office on 23 December 2020, after an overwhelming confidence vote in the Parliament (260 for in counterpart to 186 against).

In the meantime, it has been announced that a new party congress will take place on 25 September 2021 with 5,000 delegates. At the forthcoming congress, incumbent party president Ludovic Orban will face incumbent Prime Minister Florin Cîțu for the leadership of the party during the upcoming years (although it has been rumoured that Dan Motreanu, former Minister for Agriculture in the First Tăriceanu Cabinet between 2006 and 2007, would also announce his candidacy at a later point during 2021 but the latter eventually declined it). Furthermore, this new congress will also determine the leadership of PNL at each and every level within the party nationwide. Nonetheless, up until the date of the congress, Orban will still remain party president. At the same time, the struggle for power within the PNL between Cîțu and Orban (each one along with their respective teams of supporters) considerably bogged down the pace of reforms applied by the government.

==== Major involvement in the 2021 Romanian political crisis ====

During early September 2021, several weeks prior to the new congress of the party, USR-PLUS decided to exit the Cîțu Cabinet in protest to Cîțu&#x27;s dismissal of the Minister of Justice; the initial coalition consisting of three centre-right parties was thereby disbanded and reduced to two, with the USR-PLUS officially entering opposition and even publicly declaring that they will endorse any motion of no confidence against Cîțu in the future, deeming him responsible for creating a major governmental crisis in the process.

Moreover, according to USR PLUS, Cîțu is also responsible for legalizing massive theft from public procurement money with the approval of PNDL 3 (overtaking, in this regard, even convicted former PSD leader Liviu Dragnea) in the prospect of bribing PNL mayors (referred to as &quot;local barons&quot; in a press report by USR PLUS) to side with him for the then upcoming party congress which was held on 25 September 2021.

In response, Cîțu stated: &quot;only this [three-party] coalition is feasible for Romania. It&#x27;s that political setup that can handle European Union&#x27;s recovery plan, our local development, and make use of EU money,&quot; after an emergency meeting of the party. He also stated that &quot;this is my message for the coalition talks later today, we have all promised Romania&#x27;s investments&quot;.

Additionally, in response to sacking the Justice Minister, Cîțu mentioned in a late night news briefing the following: &quot;I will not accept ministers in the Romanian government who oppose the modernisation of Romania. Blocking the activity of the government only because you do not agree to develop the communities, means violating the mandate given to you by the parliament through the governing programme.&quot;, referring to a 50 billion lei ($12 billion) allegedly local development financing scheme aimed at modernizing decrepit infrastructure in the countryside and the plan which needed the justice ministry&#x27;s seal of approval.

Eventually, the PNL was helped to maintain a minority cabinet along with the UDMR/RMDSZ after they boycotted the no confidence motion initiated by the USR PLUS and AUR, with the help of both PSD and UDMR/RMDSZ parliamentary groups. In the meantime, Cîțu posted a video portraying himself as Superman on Instagram. In response, the Romanian internet community made a video in which he was portrayed as the psychopathic supervillain Joker. Moreover, Ludovic Orban hinted a psychiatric consultation for Cîțu, in reaction to the Instagram videoclip.

In addition, it was also in 2021 that, at local political level, the PNL lost other former allies, more specifically the PMP, who veered towards PSD and PRO Romania, establishing new political alliances in some counties (most notably Caraș-Severin) with the two centre-left political parties. In the meantime, former deputy prime minister Dan Barna said that &quot;if USR PLUS will remain in opposition, it will win the electorate of the right [in 2024]&quot;. Additionally, Marcel Ciolacu, the incumbent president of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and thereby the leader of the then largest opposition party, stated on 20 September 2021 that PSD will vote for the no confidence motion initiated by the USR PLUS and AUR. In the meantime, PNL president Ludovic Orban clearly stated that &quot;Cîțu could only remain Prime Minister with PSD&#x27;s endorsement which would be a catastrophe for both Romania and the PNL&quot;. In stark contrast to Orban&#x27;s statement, Iohannis declared that he still endorses Cîțu and that he has no reasons whatsoever for resigning or for being ousted. Nonetheless, in late September 2021, DNA officially started the criminal investigation in Florin Cîțu&#x27;s case on the grounds of abuse of office and incitement to abuse of office as prime minister.

Several noteworthy Romanian journalists such as Cristian Tudor Popescu, Lucian Mîndruță, and Ramona Ursu have also criticized Cîțu and his actions as prime minister and have described themselves totally revolted with respect to why would he still be left to serve as prime minister.

All throughout this period of time, the political crisis had severe results in the economy of the country, with the euro rising consistently above the leu, as reported by the National Bank of Romania (BNR) in the beginning of the autumn of 2021. Furthermore, during late September 2021, the USD had also risen consistently above the RON, as the political crisis kept on lingering. In addition, the finance department of Bloomberg also noted the record inflation levels which rose to the highest charting positions in the last three years in Romania in early September 2021.

As of 12 September 2021, most of the initial PNL-USR PLUS local alliances established after the 2020 local elections have been disbanded, with the USR PLUS entering official opposition at all local levels towards the PNL. The PNL also has a local governing alliance with the PSD in Ialomița.

===== Cîțu&#x27;s leadership (September 2021–April 2022) =====

On 25 September 2021, at the PNL congress held at Romexpo in Bucharest, Florin Cîțu was elected the 10th post-1989 president of the PNL with 2,878 votes out of 4,848 total delegates, being congratulated, most notably, by congress organiser Theodor Stolojan, amidst significant heavy fraud allegations claimed, most importantly, by previous PNL president Ludovic Orban and subsequently by Adrian Veștea. Nonetheless, Orban congratulated Cîțu but also said that he no longer has a partnership with Iohannis. Furthermore, he also stated that he resigns from the office of the President of the Chamber of Deputies. The Romanian press had also cited Cîțu&#x27;s triumph as a Pyrrhic victory given the fact that, on the one hand, PSD announced that they will vote the no confidence motion initiated by USR PLUS and AUR and, on the other hand, USR PLUS also stated that they will no longer want to govern under Cîțu.

On 26 September 2021, the party&#x27;s new leadership team under Cîțu was voted, validated, and consequently established as well. Shortly after the congress, on 27 September, former president Ludovic Orban stated that Cîțu became persona non grata for a huge number of Romanian citizens and that he doesn&#x27;t understand he will no longer be PM for too long, only with the mercy of PSD. In the meantime, the PNRR (part of the Next Generation EU package and short for ) was signed and adopted in Bucharest on the occasion of Ursula von der Leyen&#x27;s visit, mandated by the European Commission. The Romanian PNRR is the 5th Next Generation EU plan adopted by volume of funds and most of the work and successful negotiations on it were carried out by USR PLUS ministers, in particular Cristian Ghinea. Most opinion polls conducted throughout 2021 registered a significant drop of trust both in Cîțu as PM and in the PNL in the perspective of the next Romanian legislative elections which are most likely going to take place in 2024. In the meantime, PSD initiated its own motion of no confidence which is scheduled to be debated on 30 September and voted on 5 October. 
In addition, former party president Valeriu Stoica accused the recent political behaviour of PNL in the following manner: &quot;PNL acts like PSD&quot;, further stating that the party is operating on a catch all ideology and consistent party switching as well as currently defying and breaching the constitution.

On 5 October 2021, the Cîțu cabinet was ousted by an overwhelming vote on behalf of the PSD, AUR, and USR parliamentary groups at the no confidence motion debated and voted during that day. The no confidence motion was voted by 281 MPs, the largest number of votes to dismiss a government in Romania&#x27;s post-1989 history. Nevertheless, Cîțu still served as acting/ad interim prime minister until a new government will be validated by vote in the Parliament and then subsequently sworn in (i.e. for at least one week from October 5 until still incumbent President Klaus Iohannis will call for party consultations). In the meantime, former PNL president Valeriu Stoica heavily criticized Iohannis for allowing &quot;mediocre people at the leadership of the party&quot; since 2014 onwards. He previously also stated that the PNL would demonstrate gross political immaturity if they will still propose Cîțu as prime minister at subsequent party consultations scheduled to take place at the Cotroceni Palace. At the same time, he mentioned that Iohannis should have that the political status quo imposed Cîțu&#x27;s resignation, avoiding as such the motion of no confidence.

On 11 October, still incumbent President Klaus Iohannis nominated USR leader and former prime minister Dacian Cioloș to form a new government. Cioloș was subsequently rejected by the parliament and Iohannis appointed previous acting PM Nicolae Ciucă instead on 21 October 2021. In late October, relatively shortly after his dismissal, Cîțu&#x27;s approval rate hit 7% nationwide, a negative record for him. Given the matter, Cîțu resorted to buying Facebook likes from countries such as Vietnam, the ones from the ex-Soviet Union and from the Arab world, partly according to an analysis by former Health minister Vlad Voiculescu of Save Romania Union (USR). In early November 2021, journalist Lucian Mîndruță heavily criticized Iohannis and PNL for making an alliance with PSD, also stating that PSD is the only political party in post-1989 Romania which acceded to governance by &quot;walking on corpses&quot;, a reference to the dreadful demographic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Romania.

In mid-early November 2021, several noteworthy political sources hinted a very probable merger of PMP with PNL sometime in the near future (although previous PMP president Cristian Diaconescu publicly dismissed this scenario on his Facebook page) and even a possible, hypothetical absorption of ALDE afterwards (paradoxically enough, thereby subsequently producing the return of Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in the party he had previously left in 2014), just after the exclusion of Ludovic Orban from the party on 12 November 2021, who stated that &quot;he is [now] free to build a new political force&quot;. At an official level however, Cristian Diaconescu later stated that there are indeed negotiations between the delegations of the two parties for a &quot;common political project&quot;. Shortly afterwards, incumbent party president Cîțu stated, in the context of the ongoing negotiations with the PSD, that &quot;it is a major compromise that PNL does&quot; (i.e. to make a government with PSD). In stark contrast, former PNL president Orban stated that &quot;a monster is being built&quot; (in reference to the subsequent hypothetical longtime alliance between PSD and PNL) and that he has the obligation to the people who voted for PNL to represent them, as such siding with USR in the process. Subsequently, Diaconescu totally dismissed the possibility of a hypothetical merger between PMP and PNL during his term as PMP president, instead expecting a future invitation to governance, even though PMP is currently extra-parliamentary. On 22 November 2021, Nicolae Ciucă was officially designated PM by Klaus Iohannis, being in charge of a grand coalition government known as the &quot;National Coalition for Romania&quot; (CNR for short). Shortly afterwards, on 23 November 2021, former PNL president Ludovic Orban had officially resigned from the party along with 16 others PNL MPs. In December 2021, Orban officially founded his party which is called &quot;Force of the Right&quot; (or FD for short).

In early 2022, incumbent PNL spokesman Ionuț-Marian Stroe announced that the PNL has just started negotiations for a very probable near future merger with ALDE, but without former ALDE president Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, who is no longer even a member of the latter party. In addition, it was confirmed that PNL is also currently negotiating with PMP for a future merger as well. On 2 April 2022, Florin Cîțu resigned from the position of PNL president and prior to this decision Dan Vîlceanu also announced his resignation as secretary-general of the party. Gheorghe Flutur, president of the Suceava County council, became acting/ad interim president of the PNL on 2 April 2022 until a new congress was held on 10 April 2022.

===== Ciucă&#x27;s leadership (April 2022–present) =====

At an extraordinary party congress held on 10 April 2022, Nicolae Ciucă was elected the 11th post-1989 president of the PNL with 1,060 valid votes out of 1,120 total ones (60 were nullified and 159 were abstentions). Thus, Nicolae Ciucă became the first military leader in the history of the party. Additionally, Ciucă&#x27;s primary objective as PNL president was to maintain the cohesion of the &quot;CNR&quot; grand coalition until the end of his term as prime minister which took place in mid June 2023. Afterwards, the PNL maintained the CNR grand coalition only with PSD, removing UDMR/RMDSZ from government, but retaining the confidence and supply agreement with the political group of the national minorities in the Parliament, thereby still having a solid majority needed for endorsing the incumbent Ciolacu Cabinet.

In terms of external politics, the CNR government led by former prime minister Nicolae Ciucă expressed serious concern over the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. Internally, the PNL chose their new secretary-general on 27 May 2022, when the party&#x27;s national council re-united to vote for this position in front of 1,000 national delegates.

Under Ciucă&#x27;s premiership, Romania experienced democratic backsliding, with The Economist ranking it last in the European Union in the world terms of democracy, even behind Viktor Orbán&#x27;s Hungary.

Furthermore, since both Cîțu and Ciucă&#x27;s leaderships, more and more PNL MPs and local politicians had departed from the party, some of which founded splinter political parties in the meantime. The party has also lost at least several electoral points for the forthcoming electoral year of 2024 (most notably for the next Romanian parliamentary election) according to most opinion polls.

== Ideology ==

The party officially adheres to the doctrine of liberalism in the form of conservative liberalism and liberal conservatism, advocating both economic and social liberalization. The party also takes a pro-European stance. In recent years, it has focused more on economic liberalism and a shift to a more catch all platform. The National Liberal Party (PNL) also advocates for conservative initiatives and policies and the state in moral and religious issues, as well as the privatization and denationalization of the economy, a trend which is currently taking place quite rapidly in Romania, as in other post-communist economies in Central and Eastern Europe. Unlike its Western counterparts, the party is more nationalist and traditionalist on social issues, such as LGBT rights.

The party has factions of adherence to Christian democracy, ethnic nationalism, neoliberalism, and social conservatism. The party has also been described as populist, while former president Florin Cîțu rejects this qualification. However, after joining the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and especially under Cîțu and Ciucă&#x27;s leadership, the party became more conservative, Radio Free Europe calling it &quot;liberal only in the name&quot;. PNL opposes same-sex marriage as well as civil unions.

In economic regards, it deems significant the fact that taxes must be lowered and that the private sector of the national economy must be expanded and helped by a series of new laws in order to generate more value. It also advocates a decentralization of Romania&#x27;s political structure, with greater autonomy given to the eight development regions. However, under Ciucă&#x27;s rule, the party also shifted more from a liberal-oriented economy towards economic patriotism. Opposition leader Cătălin Drulă, the incumbent president of the Save Romania Union (USR), accused the party of being statist.

== Structure ==
According to the statute, the leading organs of the party are the following:

Romanian law requires all parties to present a permanent sign and a permanent electoral sign. The former is used to identify the party&#x27;s buildings and press releases, and the latter to identify the party&#x27;s electoral materials and the candidates on the elections ballot. Usually they differ slightly.

The main element of the party is a blue arrow pointing to the upper right corner of a yellow square, and the letters &quot;P&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, and &quot;L&quot; in blue, tilted to the right. The position of the &quot;PNL&quot; with respect to the arrow depends on the type of symbol, as shown below.

<text>The Battle of [[Saalfeld]] took place on 10 October 1806, at which a French force of 12,800 men commanded by Marshal Jean Lannes defeated a Prussian-Saxon force of 8,300 men under Prince Louis Ferdinand. The battle took place in Thuringia in what was the Ernestine duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The battle was the second clash in the Prussian Campaign of the War of the Fourth Coalition.

==Background==
===French Movements===
 Napoleon had arranged the into three columns to cross the Thuringian Forest to attack the Prussian-Saxon army. The westernmost column was headed by V Corps commanded by Jean Lannes, with Pierre Augereau&#x27;s VII Corps following behind. They had orders to march from Coburg via Gräfenthal due at Saalfeld on 11 October. V Corps set out on 8 October, and by the end of 9 October was at Gräfenthal with light cavalry on the road to Saalfeld. At 5 am on 10 October, Lannes with Louis-Gabriel Suchet&#x27;s division and Anne-François-Charles Trelliard brigade of light cavalry of V corps began advancing down the road to Saalfeld, aware that a Prussian-Saxon force was in front of them.

===Prussian-Saxon movements===
 Prince Louis Ferdinand commanded the Advanced Guard of Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen&#x27;s army and on 9 October the Prince his headquarters at Rudolstadt, with detachments at Saalfeld, , and Bad Blankenburg. The Prince had received a message from Hohenlohe that the Prussian-Saxon army would be advancing across the River Saale to support Bogislav Friedrich Emanuel von Tauentzien&#x27;s force after the Battle of Schleiz, and that Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel&#x27;s main army would be advancing to Rudolstadt. In the evening of 9 October Oberst Leopold Ludwig Maximilian Nordeck zu Rabenau (who commanded a detachment at Saalfeld) reported to Prince Louis that a French column of between 16,000 and 20,000 men had left Coburg heading for Saalfeld and that a post of 30 hussars stationed at Gräfenthal and the Jäger Company &quot;&quot;Valentini&quot; stationed at had both retreated to Arnsgereuth after clashing with the French. Knowing that the main body of the army under Hohenlohe was due to advance across the River Saale on 10 October, Prince Louis therefore decided that his forces needed to stop the French column from either crossing the Saale at Saalfeld and interfering with Hohenlohe’s movements or from moving up the western side of the Saale to Rudolstadt, which they would reach before Brunswick’s army. During 9 October a fusilier company commanded by August von Gneisenau was sent to Arnsgereuth to support the troops there, and having confirmed that the French were advancing on Saalfeld and in strength, the Prussian troops withdrew from Arnsgereuth to , just outside Saalfeld, with advance posts in .

At 7 am Prince Louis began concentrating his troops at Saalfeld, and by 9 am he had arranged his forces for battle. The troops were arranged in a line stretching from in front of Saalfeld to behind and facing the woods the covered the hills above Saalfeld and the Saale valley. The Prince left Generalmajor Karl Gerhard von Pelet&#x27;s detachment at Blankenburg.

===Order of battle===
==Battle==

At around 9.45 AM, the advanced guard of V Corps, consisting of the corps&#x27; &quot;Bataillon d&#x27;élite&quot; (formed of the elite companies of battalions left at depots), the 17th Légère Regiment, and two cannons, made its way towards Saalfeld and occupied the heights overlooking the town. The French light cavalry brigade and the advanced guard began to engage the Prussian-Saxon army. The &quot;Bataillon d&#x27;élite&quot; supported by French skirmishers pushed out the Prussian troops from Garnsdorf and occupied it. As the French troops advanced and the Prussian-Saxon army prepared to fight them, Marshal Lannes noticed that the right flank of the Prussian-Saxon army was completely uncovered, and while the cavalry and French advanced guard engaged the Prussians around Garnsdorf and Saalfeld, he ordered rest of Suchet&#x27;s division to march northwards through the woods to outflank the Prussian and Saxon line. To cover these moves, the 17th Légère Regiment formed a skirmish line that extended from Saalfeld to Beulwitz.

Prince Louis was aware that he was engaged with a larger force, and then at 11am, Saxon Souslieutnant Heinrich August von Egidy brought a verbal order from Prince Hohenlohe to remain at Rudolstadt and that the offensive across the Saale had been abandoned. Prince Louis decided to try and disengage with the French and retreat to Rudolstadt. He ordered second battalion of the &quot;Müffling&quot; Regiment to Schwarza to hold the bridges, and sent troops under the Saxon Generalmajor to extend the right of his line to the hills either side of (known as the Oberhayn and Sandberg). He also ordered the &quot;Prince Xaver&quot; and &quot;Kurfürst&quot; regiments to take the offensive by attacking the plain between Siechentbal and the Kesselthal streams. The skirmishers of the 17th Légère Regiment supported with the 34th Ligne Regiment (which had moved out of the woods into Beulwitz) repelled the Saxon regiments, who then fell back in disorder. Prince Louis rallied these troops, and fearing that he would lose communication with General Bevilaqua and his troops, he ordered another attack, and by midday the &quot;Kurfürst&quot; regiment had captured Crösten. Thinking that his centre was secure, Prince Louis gave further orders for a withdrawal. The French had entered Saalfeld and were pushing the Prussian troops back to , where Prince Louis headed to rally these troops.
At just before 1pm, Marshal Lannes gave the signal for the offensive. The 34th, 40th, and 64th Ligne headed towards the Saxon troops around Aue am Berg, whilst the French cavalry, with the 88th Ligne behind them, moved forward between Crösten and Saalfeld. Prince Louis decided this was a moment to engage the French cavalry with the Prussian and Saxon cavalry, attacking an exposed flank of the 21st Chasseurs à Cheval. However, the second line of French cavalry then enveloped the Prince&#x27;s outnumbered cavalry line. Order in the Prussian and Saxon cavalry began to break down, and they fled joining the troops retreating from Saalfeld. In the confused mass around Wöhlsdorf, many were cut down by the French hussars and some drowned trying to escape across the Saale. Prince Louis tried to cut his way out towards Schwarza, during which he was attacked by Quartermaster Guindet of the 10th Hussars. Although wounded, Prince Louis refused to surrender and was killed.

Meanwhile, on the Prussian-Saxon right, General Bevilaqua tried to reinforce the Sandberg with the &quot;Prinz Clemens&quot; regiment, but then seeing the rout at Wöhlsdorf, Bevilaqua ordered a retreat to Scwharza. As the first battalion of the &quot;Prince Clemens&quot; Regiment moved down the slope it was attacked repeatedly by the 21st Chasseurs à Cheval, and the Saxons broke under the onslaught. the 21st Chasseurs à Cheval then assaulted and successively broke the second battalion &quot;Prinz Clemens&quot; Regiment and first battalion &quot;Müffling&quot;&quot; Regiment. As these troops dispersed, General Bevilaqua was captured.

There was a final conflict at Schwarza and Pelet&#x27;s force engaged the French around Unter-Wirbach. Pelet&#x27;s force was largely intact but had to retreat to Stadt-Ilm, which it reached at 10pm. The French cavalry pursued the remains of the Prussian and Saxon units to Rudolstadt, but the French infantry halted at Schwarza. Some of the Prussian and Saxon troops that had escaped onto the east side of the Saale withdrew towards Rudolstadt.

==Aftermath==
Prince Louis&#x27; force had been completely dispersed as a fighting force. Only Pelet&#x27;s detachment was intact, and they were forced to take a long route to rejoin Hohenlohe.

Despite this battle and the battle of Schleiz, Napoleon was still not fully aware of location of the Prussian army. After four days of further marches, the French engaged the Prussians and Saxons at the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt on the plateau west of the river Saale.

A memorial stone commemorates the site of the battle and Prince Louis Ferdinand&#x27;s death. The plaque reads &quot;Here Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia fell fighting for his grateful Fatherland on 10 October 1806&quot;.

<text>The Popular Action (, AP) is a liberal and reformist political party in Peru, founded by former Peruvian president Fernando Belaúnde.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Fernando Belaúnde founded Popular Action (&quot;Acción Popular&quot;) in 1956 as a reformist alternative to the status quo conservative forces and the populist American Popular Revolutionary Alliance party.

Although Belaúnde&#x27;s message was not all that different from APRA&#x27;s, his tactics were more inclusive and less confrontational. He was able to appeal to some of the same political base as APRA, primarily the middle class, but also to a wider base of professionals and white-collar workers. It also advocated scientific advancement and technocracy, a policy set that it took from the Progressive Social Movement, a splinter party which it eventually absorbed. The AP had significant electoral success, attaining the presidency in 1963 and 1980, but the party was more of an electoral machine for the persona of Belaúnde than an institutionalized organization. The AP was initially reckoned as a center-left party. However, by the 1980s, Peru&#x27;s political spectrum had shifted sharply leftward, and the AP found itself on the center-right.

=== Later years ===
After AP&#x27;s second administration, in 1985, the party was defeated by the APRA party, gaining only 6.4 percent of the vote. In 1990, AP participated in the elections as a part of the Democratic Front, a center-right coalition headed by Mario Vargas Llosa.

In 2000, Víctor Andrés García Belaúnde was selected as the presidential nominee, being the worst general election for AP, gaining only 0.42% of the popular vote. Only three AP congressman were elected. As many assume the election was a fraud, Fujimori resigned after the corruption of his government was revealed by the opposition.

AP member Valentín Paniagua would become President of the Congress in November 2000 for a few days and, after the fall of the Fujimori administration, became the interim President of the Republic, holding office from November 2000 to July 2001.

At the 8 April 2001 election, the party won 4.2% of the popular vote and three out of 120 seats in Congress.

Likewise, in 2002, regional elections were held for the first time, which aimed to elect Regional Presidents for the 25 departments of Peru. In that sense, party participation was quite high (15 political groups). In these elections, AP ranked sixth by number of votes.

For the 2006 national election, the party joined forces with We Are Peru and National Coordinator of Independents to form the Centre Front coalition. Paniagua was the presidential candidate, while the vice-presidential candidates belonged to AP&#x27;s allies. The Center Front ended in the fifth place in the national election, with 5.6% of the popular vote.

For the 2011 national election, the party joined forces with We Are Peru and Possible Peru to form the Possible Peru Electoral Alliance. The presidential candidate was former Peru&#x27;s president and leader of Possible Peru, Alejandro Toledo. The alliance ended in the fourth place in the national election, with 15.6% of the popular vote.

For the 2016 national election, the party ran alone for the first time since 2000, when Congressman Víctor Andrés García Belaúnde ran against the sitting president Alberto Fujimori, and it was the first time since 2006 that Popular Action participated with a party member as a presidential candidate, when former President Valentín Paniagua ran for office. The presidential candidate was Alfredo Barnechea, journalist and political analyst, who won the party&#x27;s primaries with 52% of the votes, defeating Mesías Guevara (40%), the party&#x27;s president for the 2014–2018 term, the lawyer Beatríz Mejía (6%) and former Deputy Alejandro Montoya (2%). Popular Action ended in fourth place in the national election, with 6.97% of the popular vote. This was the best result for Popular Action since 1985. For the 2016–2021 term, AP had five congressmen out of 130 representing the party, until the snap election in 2020, when it increased its representation to 25 congressmen until the end of the 2016–2021 term. In the 2021 elections, Lescano placed 5th in a fractured race of 18 candidates while the party gained 16 seats for the 2021–2026 congressional term. On 26 July 2021, an alliance led by Popular Action member María del Carmen Alva successfully negotiated an agreement to gain control of Peru&#x27;s Congress.

== Doctrine ==
Popularactionism is the name that has been given to the party&#x27;s ideological doctrine. It is pointed out that the main feature of his thinking is a situational humanism.

Popularactionism considers that the role of the State should be limited to regulating and encouraging private enterprise and sustainable development. Within the main feature of his theory, situational humanism, it considers in the Peruvian case that it is specifically inspired by what has been called &quot;Peru as Doctrine&quot;.

It affirms that the proclamation is of a &quot;democratic, nationalist and revolutionary&quot; court:

* Democratic, inasmuch as it respects, disseminates and defends the democratic system.
* Nationalist, in that it promotes local traditions and economic and cultural development.
* Revolutionary, inasmuch as it aspires to keeping up-to-date with the new modernity and rapid change that improves social and cultural structures.

The idea of &quot;Peru as Doctrine&quot; is based on the values and principles arising from the historical and cultural particularity in which Peru developed but which have universal significance. An important part of their doctrine is developed in what they call Popular Cooperation.

In Peruvian political history it has happened that on occasions the right has called Popular Action a leftist party (first government) or that the left has called it a right-wing party (second government). Towards the end of the 1960s, a radicalized sector split from the party (the so-called &quot;hotheads&quot;), forming Acción Popular Socialista (Manuel Seoane, Gustavo Mohme, among other intellectuals).

Likewise, a significant percentage of the so-called &quot;young Turks&quot; (or &quot;chapulines&quot;/grasshoppers, young popularactionists of the early 1980s), at the beginning of the 1990s migrated to liberal political positions (to the Liberty Movement and then to Fujimorism). These are the two biggest party losses suffered by this party. Consequently, from then on, Popular Action is generally identified with positions of the center, with factions of both the progressive left and the conservative right.

Towards the end of the 1990s, the former popularactionist Luis Castañeda founded the National Solidarity, which with an alliance with the Christian People&#x27;s Party within the National Unity coalition won the municipal elections in the capital, Lima, in 2002.

<text>Union for Peru () is a Peruvian political party founded by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, an ex-UN Secretary General, in 1994 to run for the presidency of Peru in the 1995 general elections. Originally a social democratic party, the party became the main political home of the Peruvian ethnocacerist movement in the late-2010s after a group led by former Army Major Antauro Humala joined the party. Humala later formed the Patriotic Front in 2018 and contested the 2021 general elections.

== History ==
Union for Peru was founded in 1994 by the former Secretary General of the United Nations, the diplomat Javier Pérez de Cuéllar together with Daniel Estrada Pérez and José Vega Antonio, to participate in the elections generals of 1995, against the-then dictator Alberto Fujimori, who was running for reelection.

At the elections held on 9 April 2000, the party nominated former Fujimorist first vice president Máximo San Román as its presidential candidate, but he performed poorly in the elections placing last with 0.3% of the popular vote but in the legislative elections, the party won 2.6% of the popular vote and only 3 out of 120 seats in the Congress of the Republic, a decrease of 14. During this parliamentary period, UPP made an alliance with the Popular Action bench in the legislature and both showed their opposition to the dictatorship of Alberto Fujimori.

Shortly after Alberto Fujimori won the 2000 elections amid accusations of electoral fraud, he decided to resign after the &quot;Vladivideos&quot; scandal and call general elections for 2001.

At the legislative elections held on 8 April 2001, the party won 4.1% of the popular vote and 6 out of 120 seats in the Congress of the Republic. However, they did not present a presidential candidate for that year&#x27;s elections.

In the 2006 elections, Union for Peru aligned itself with the Peruvian Nationalist Party and endorsed Ollanta Humala, who faced Alan García in the presidential runoff election. In the congressional election, the alliance won with 21.2% of popular vote, and 45 out of 120 seats in the Congress. However, after the elections, the alliance split and the Nationalist sat on their own bench with Union for Peru sitting in their own bench too.

In the 2011 elections, the party joined forces with the National Solidarity Party to form the National Solidarity Alliance to support the presidential candidacy of former Lima Mayor Luis Castañeda Lossio. The alliance placed fifth at both the presidential and parliamentary election, attaining 9 out of 130 seats, with Vicente Zeballos and Martin Belaunde Moreya as the only two elected congressman from Union for Peru. The party would retain its alliance with the National Solidarity Party for the 2016 elections as well, jointly nominating Hernando Guerra García but the ticket withdrew due to its low support at national polls and fears of losing its status as a political party. In the 2020 snap parliamentary elections, the party won 6.8% of the vote and 13 seats out of 130 seats in the Congress after almost four years of absence in Congress. In the 2021 elections, the party nominated the party Secretary-General José Vega for the presidency, but, he was disqualified on 29 December 2020, because of incomplete information regarding income on the nominees registration form, but he was reinstated on 6 February 2021. On the Election Day, Vega places 14th with 0.7% of the vote, while in the congressional election, the party lost all of its 13 seats and only won 2.1% of the vote and the party is expected to lose its party registration.

The party&#x27;s Secretary-General as of 2021 was José Vega Antonio.

<text>The Fiat Ritmo is a small, front-engine, front-wheel drive family car manufactured and marketed by Fiat, launched in April 1978 at the Turin Motor show and offered in 3- and 5-door hatchback and cabriolet body styles – from 1978 to 1988 with two facelifts.

Styled by Sergio Sartorelli at Fiat&#x27;s Centro Stile in Turin, export versions for the UK, US and Canada were marketed as the Strada. In 1979, SEAT Ritmo production began in Spain, with a facelift in 1982, the SEAT Ronda.

The name Ritmo derives from the Italian for &quot;rhythm&quot;, and &quot;Strada&quot; derives from the Italian for &quot;road.&quot; Production reached a total of 1,790,000 and ended in early 1988 it was replaced by the Fiat Tipo.

==Development==

Fiat began designing the Ritmo hatchback – as a replacement for the 128 sedan – in 1972, following the body style of its 127 supermini as European manufacturers began launching small family hatchbacks, notably the Volkswagen Golf in 1974.

Prior to its launch, the press speculated that the project codename &quot;138&quot; would be the final production name, however, Fiat instead gave its new car the &quot;Ritmo&quot; name, rather than another three digit number.

The Ritmo was manufactured at the Cassino plant using a system developed by its subsidiary Comau, the &quot;Robogate&quot; system – which automated the bodyshell assembly and welding process using robots, giving rise to its advertising slogan &quot;Handbuilt by robots&quot;, immortalised in a television advertising campaign showing the robots assembling the Ritmo bodyshells to the strains of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. The exterior has plastic bumper fascias integrated into the styling which combined strong round shapes with overall sharp lines, achieving a . The plastic bumpers also resisted damage from impacts of speeds of up to .

===First series (1978)===
The initial four-cylinder engine range included 1.1-litre (), 1.3-litre () and 1.5-litre () petrol engines, inherited from the Fiat 128, although the engines were noticeably quieter in the more insulated Ritmo. Suspension was independent all-round, the braking system comprised front discs and rear drums and the wheels measured 13-inch in diameter. Gearboxes ranged from a standard four-speed manual (five-speed optional on CL models) and an optional three-speed Volkswagen-derived automatic. Its boot capacity ranged from 330 to 1,100 litres.

The Ritmo finished second in the European Car of the Year awards, finishing narrowly behind the winning car, the Simca-Chrysler Horizon – which was similar in concept. The initial range in Italy was designated by their respective engine horsepower (PS):

* 60 CL (3- and 5-door, priced L4,679,000 to 4,879,000)
* 65 L (5-door, priced L4,726,000)
* 65 CL (3- and 5-door, priced L4,797,000 to 4,997,000)

The &quot;CL&quot; range were the better-equipped models (with the 60 CL comprising 80% of total initial sales in Italy) and the whole range also distinguished itself by having numerous optional accessories unseen in past Fiat cars. These included: larger tyres; a rev counter; stereo system; safety seatbelts and headrests; passenger-side rear view mirror; split-fold rear seat; tinted windows; rear window wiper; rear window defroster; metallic paint; sunroof (the most expensive at L259.60). The instrumentation was incorporated in a rectangular pod with modular slots that could house various gauges and switches, either standard depending on the model or optional (e.g. digital clock and switches for hazard lights or adjustable-speed ventilation fan). Export markets also received the 1.5-litre 75 CL with a five-speed manual, a model which was initially unavailable in the domestic Italian market.

The colour of the interiors was determined by the external paint, as follows:
* beige interior: &quot;azzurro rodi&quot; (light blue), &quot;rosso cina&quot; (red), &quot;verde Kent&quot; (green) and metallic &quot;verde medio&quot; (medium green);
* blue interior: &quot;bianco yacht&quot; (white), &quot;blu lord&quot; (royal blue) and metallic &quot;azzurro (light blue)&quot; and &quot;alluminio&quot; (silver);
* brown interior: &quot;arancio messico&quot; (orange), &quot;grigio jet&quot; (grey) and metallic &quot;rosso rame&quot; (copper).

The Ritmo was criticized for its basic interior trim (e.g. no fabric on door panels). Fiat responded in 1979 with various revisions and the introduction of the &quot;Targa Oro&quot; (&quot;gold plate&quot;) range. The latter was based on the Ritmo 65 (or 75 for export markets) and was distinguished by mink or black paint with gold striping and accents in the alloy wheels, foglights, dark bumper bars and velour trim interiors. From February 1979, the 75 CL range had an optional VW-derived automatic transmission – the &quot;Automatica&quot; was the only 1.5-engined version marketed in Italy. At the same time, the &quot;60 L&quot; models for Italy and some export markets had its 1.1-litre 128-derived engine replaced by a 1049 cc petrol engine built by Fiat of Brazil. Through the use of a new carburetor and altered timing, power and torque figures were kept the same as those of the 1.1, up by ten horsepower over what the engine produced as installed in the 127. The 60 CL - the fastest-selling Ritmo in the Italian market at the time - continued to use the comparable 1116 cc engine.

At the 1980 Geneva Motor Show, a five-door only diesel version – marketed as the &quot;Ritmo D&quot; and available in both L and CL trim – was introduced with a 1,714 cc engine (). To accommodate this considerably heavier engine, the steering rack was slowed down (from 3.5 to 4 turns) and the suspension adjusted. Nonetheless, a 65.5% forward weight distribution was hard to mask and both handling and braking suffered when compared to petrol-powered Ritmos.

In 1981, the &quot;Targa Oro&quot; and 75 models were replaced by the five-door only &quot;Ritmo Super&quot; (or &quot;Superstrada&quot; in some export markets). They brought higher specification and fittings (from chrome trimmings to a more complete instrumentation and optional central locking), larger, 14-inch, wheels and, most significantly, revised engines with (1300) and (1500). This extra power was gained through slight alterations to the camshaft profile, a twin carburettor, and a twin exhaust system. Other differences included lower profile tyres (Pirelli P8) and a close-ratio five-speed manual gearbox. The steering was also somewhat faster. By this time, the Ritmo range in Italy also included three- and five-door manual versions of the 75 CL and three-door 75 CL Automatica, with the price of the popular 60CL now ranging from L6,868,000 to L7,180,000 for the three- and five-door versions, respectively.

In May 1981, the first sports version, the &quot;Ritmo 105 TC&quot;, was launched. Available only as a three-door, it was powered by a Fiat DOHC engine with a displacement of 1,585 cc, which was derived from that used in the 131 and 132 models. This car had the same wheels as the Ritmo Super, but with black centre hubcaps. British and Irish models had black and silver Speedline alloy wheels (5.5 x 14) as standard. Other distinguishing features relative to the normal range included: front fog lights integrated into the front bumper; integrated front spoiler combined with wheel arch extensions; black lower door paint; black mesh air intake; and a rear spoiler at the base of the rear window. That same year, Fiat also launched the &quot;Ritmo Cabrio&quot;.
In September 1981, Fiat displayed the &quot;Ritmo Abarth 125 TC&quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show. This model was not available for right-hand export markets because the position of the exhaust downpipe did not allow for a relocated steering column and system. The 125 TC was a modified and revised 105 TC with a 1,995 cc DOHC four with , ventilated front discs, a new five-speed ZF manual gearbox, revised suspension settings and strengthened components. Outwardly, the 125 TC differed only slightly from the 105 TC – it gained the chunky four-spoke 14 in alloys later seen on the Bertone Cabrio models, featured an &quot;Abarth&quot; red and black badge on the rear hatch, and the side badges featured the Abarth &quot;Scorpion&quot;. The 125 TC version had a top speed of and it could accelerate from 0 to in 8.7 seconds. These cars were the last ones assembled on a separate Abarth production line, following the Fiat buyout in 1971.

===Second series (1982)===

In October 1982, the Ritmo was reengineered and restyled to improve its competitiveness against rivals, which included the MK3 Ford Escort and the first front-wheel drive Opel Kadett (Vauxhall Astra in the UK). The chassis was lighter by and benefitted from better noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) control. Suspension mounts were altered and the spare tyre was moved from the engine bay to the boot, along with a relocation of the fuel tank to ahead of the rear axle. The fuel tank move resulted in the fuel cap being moved to the right side and under a lid instead of remaining exposed. The facelift saw the Ritmo acquire a more conventional look. For example, the round headlights no longer intersected the bumper bar but were now integrated in a separate grille, and the tail lights were similarly integrated into the body instead of inset in the rear bumper. In addition, all models now featured Fiat&#x27;s new corporate five-bar emblem at the centre of the grille, with base models featuring single round headlamps and all other, double round headlights (in Britain, all models of this generation featured twin headlamps). The bonnet no longer had an air scoop and the roof was now completely flat (with the upward sweep of the first series found to cause vortices and contribute to dust and water over the rear window). The 1,049 cc &quot;Brazil&quot; engine was discontinued. Better aerodynamics, lower weight, and engine optimizations combined to increase fuel mileage by around ten percent on most of the range.

The 105 TC was relaunched with revised interior trim, a dashboard similar to that of the earlier Ritmo Super and an upper hatchback spoiler in place of the lower one. In Britain, seven-spoke alloy wheels replaced the earlier Speedline ones. In British advertising the car was named &quot;Strada II&quot;, but it was badged as the Strada. The North American version was unchanged but was finally discontinued at the end of the 1982 model year (at which time the Fiat range included only the X1/9 and the 124 Spider).

In 1983, Fiat completed the range with the &quot;Ritmo ES&quot; (&quot;energy saving&quot;) models and the hot hatch, &quot;Ritmo Abarth 130 TC&quot;. The latter was based on the 125 TC but was powered by a 1995 cc engine with power output increased to . This was achieved by replacing the single Weber carb used in the 125 TC with twin Solex/Weber carburettors on a side-draught manifold, and via improved cam profiles. The 130 TC had a top speed of and accelerated from 0 to in 7.8 seconds. It was fitted with Recaro bucket seats in Britain and Ireland (optional in Europe) and it remained the only 1980s European hot hatch to continue to utilise carburettors instead of fuel injection. Ignition timing was controlled electronically. Although appearing outwardly similar to the restyled 105 TC with its lower door and wheelarch trims, the 130 TC could be distinguished by its polished four-spoke alloy wheels (continued from the earlier 125 TC), aerodynamic perspex front door wind deflectors, and lower hatchback spoiler. The powerful twin-cam was mated to a close ratio five-speed ZF manual gearbox and had superior performance to its contemporary rivals, which included the Volkswagen Golf GTI, Ford Escort XR3i, Vauxhall Astra GTE and the MG Maestro.

A second-series Ritmo 125TC was made available for 1983 only in Austria and Switzerland. It was externally identical to the 130TC, but featured a single carburettor, which reduced power to comply with tax regulations in those two countries.

There was a minor change in the spring of 1984, mainly consisting of a new range hierarchy. Aside from the three-door, four-speed &quot;L&quot; versions (&quot;60&quot; and &quot;diesel&quot;), all non-sporting Ritmos now had five-speed manual gearboxes and five-door bodywork. The upper-class 85 Super version was dropped in Italy, where smaller-engined versions ruled the marketplace. The 1.1 litre 60 Super models were new to the lineup.

This Ritmo (and the third series) was also built in Venezuela, only in the five-door version. Two models were available: the 85 and the 105TC, with the 85 only available with the automatic transmission from Volkswagen and the 105TC being a five-speed manual. Unique to Venezuela was the fact that the 105TC was not offered in a three-door version, the only option available in the rest of the world.

===Third series (1985)===

1985 saw a minor facelift to the Ritmo range, featuring new rectangular door handles on five-door versions (the three-door retained circular door handles), shared with the Regata – the Ritmo-derived sedan. Other changes included restyled front and rear bumpers, and lower plastic panels on the doors (again, taken from the Regata). The rear bumper now housed the number plate at low level, whilst the space between the rear lights was filled with a plastic panel. The 1,714 cc diesel engine was replaced with a 1,697 cc unit from the Uno 60D, developing . The three-door 105 TC model was replaced by the five-door &quot;Ritmo 100 S&quot; (also fitted with a 1,585 cc DOHC engine). The 130 TC Abarth benefitted from the same external changes as the other models, in addition to new wheels and interior trim. In 1986, a new diesel version was launched with a 1,929 cc intercooled turbodiesel (), and was badged as the &quot;Ritmo Turbo DS&quot; (as a five-door only). While marketed across continental Europe, the 100 S and the Turbo DS were not sold in Great Britain or Ireland, nor were any of the fuel injected models. The latter included the 75 i.e. and 90 i.e., which had lower outputs due to their catalytic converters fitted to meet tougher export markets&#x27; emission regulations. By this stage, however, Ritmo/Strada sales were declining outside Italy, not helped by its reputation for unreliability and rust, nor the growing number of competitors which were appearing. However, the Ritmo&#x27;s falling popularity in these markets was compensated for by the growing success of its smaller stablemate, the Uno.

To spur more sales, in 1986 Fiat launched two limited editions:
* the &quot;Ritmo Team&quot; (with 60 and D engines and based on a five-door CL) in May; and
* the &quot;Ritmo Super Team&quot; (with 60, 70 and 100 engines fitted with central locking, power windows and adjustable steering wheel).

Early in 1988, the production of the Ritmo ended after 10 years. In its place, as the new contender in the European C-segment, Fiat launched the similarly avantgarde, Tipo, which took inspiration from the smaller Uno with its design and style.

==Other models or variants==
The Fiat Ritmo cabrio was originally displayed as a concept at the 1979 Frankfurt Motor Show but went on sale in mainland Europe only in 1981. It was assembled by Bertone and, coinciding with the 1982 facelift, was badged as a Bertone instead of a Fiat. It was cheaper than, and competed against, the Volkswagen Golf cabriolet but was not up to Volkswagen standards in terms of quality or ability, despite the fact that the German rival was not built in-house, but by Karmann.

With the introduction of the Series 2 cars, Fiat began manufacture of a RHD Ritmo Cabrio, which was offered in the UK (Superstrada Cabrio) and Ireland (Ritmo Cabrio) only in 85S (Superstrada) guise.

The Bertone cabriolet was sold in various European markets in petrol-engined form only (75S, 85S, 100S; some with fuel injection) until 1988. There were various special editions including the &quot;Ritmo Cabrio Chrono&quot; and &quot;Ritmo Cabrio Bianco&quot; (all white).

A sedan version, the &quot;Regata&quot;, was launched in 1983 with limited success outside of Italy despite being sold more globally, including in Australia. Mechanically similar to the Ritmo, the sedan was offered with 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6-litre petrol engines, and diesel 1.7 and 1.9-litre or 1.9-litre turbodiesel engines. A station wagon version—badged the &quot;Regata Weekend&quot;—was launched in 1984 and a unique design feature was represented by its folding rear bumper section, which created a level loading bay. The Regata received a minor facelift in 1986 (bumpers, doors and interior) as well as fuel injection fitted for some engines – most notably the 1,585 cc &quot;100S i.e.&quot;

==Alternative names==

===Fiat Strada===

The Ritmo was sold on the British market as the Strada from the autumn of 1978 until it was replaced by the Tipo in July 1988. Despite decent early sales, surprising given its unconventional styling, it was soon overshadowed by a host of new British-built and imported competitors, and by the 1980s was selling very slowly, although Fiat&#x27;s overall market share in the UK increased sharply throughout the 1980s due to the huge success of the smaller Uno.

In North America, the Fiat Strada was introduced in January 1979 (for the same model year) to replace the 128. Available with either three or five doors, it used the same 1.5-litre SOHC engine as the X1/9 coupé, generating , and featured a standard five-speed manual gearbox or a three-speed automatic from Volkswagen as optional equipment. For 1981 the engine gained fuel injection for all states, meaning that power increased to . In spite of excellent fuel economy, a roomy interior, and comfortable ride, the Strada failed to convince enough buyers to forget reliability issues from previous Fiat models and was withdrawn from North America in 1982. Strict North American collision standards resulted in this Strada featuring extended plastic bumper bars.

===SEAT Ritmo===
Spanish car maker SEAT began their history as a Fiat licensee from 1948, manufacturing clones of the Italian cars. From 1979 to 1982, a Spanish version of the Ritmo, the SEAT Ritmo, was produced in Spain near Barcelona. The original SEAT Ritmo was equipped with licence-built pushrod engines from the old Fiat 124. The end of the above partnership began in 1982, coinciding with a new SEAT logo and the launch of the &quot;System Porsche&quot;-engined SEAT Ronda, which remained in production until 1986. An intellectual property dispute arose and was ultimately resolved by the Arbitration Chamber of Paris in 1983, which found that the Ronda was sufficiently different from the Ritmo (much to the angst of Fiat due to rumours that its restyle was very close to that of the Ronda). As part of this dispute, SEAT showed a black Ronda with all the in-house developed components painted in bright yellow, in order to highlight key differences between the two products.

In 1982, SEAT entered into a new licensing agreement, this time with Volkswagen. In 1984, SEAT manufactured the new Giugiaro-designed and &quot;System Porsche&quot;-engined Ibiza, which still had Ritmo underpinnings. Moreover, mirroring the Regata, in 1985 SEAT also developed and launched the four-door Málaga sedan. All ties with Fiat underpinnings were finally severed when Volkswagen took majority ownership of SEAT in 1986 and began producing cars in Spain based on German-developed platforms.

==Revival of the Ritmo name==
The Ritmo name was revived in Australia by the Fiat importer, Ateco, with the new Bravo sold there with Ritmo badging beginning in February 2008. This rebadging was due to the fact that, in Australia, Mazda had been using the name Bravo for its B Series pickup. Although pre-launch indication were that the Ritmo name would also be used for New Zealand, this never eventuated since Fiat were able to use the Bravo nameplate there. The new Ritmo sold slowly and was discontinued in 2009; the name has remained retired since.

<doc id="863918" wikidata="Q1074200" url="?curid=863918" title="Eternal return">
<text>Eternal return (or eternal recurrence) is a philosophical concept which states that time repeats itself in an infinite loop, and that exactly the same events will continue to occur in exactly the same way, over and over again, for eternity.

In ancient Greece, the concept of eternal return was most prominently associated with Empedocles and with Stoicism, the school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium. The Stoics believed that the universe is periodically destroyed and reborn, and that each universe is exactly the same as the one before. This doctrine was fiercely criticised by Christian authors such as Augustine, who saw in it a fundamental denial of free will and of the possibility of salvation. The global spread of Christianity therefore brought an end to classical theories of eternal return.

The concept was revived in the 19th century by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Having briefly presented the idea as a thought experiment in &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, he explored it more thoroughly in his novel &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, in which the protagonist learns to overcome his horror of the thought of eternal return. It is not known whether Nietzsche believed in the literal truth of eternal return, or, if he did not, what he intended to demonstrate by it.

Nietzsche&#x27;s ideas were subsequently taken up and re-interpreted by other writers, such as Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky, who argued that it was possible to break the cycle of return.

==Classical antiquity==
===Pythagoreanism===
There are hints in ancient writings that the theory of eternal return may have originated with Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC). According to Porphyry, it was one of the teachings of Pythagoras that &quot;after certain specified periods, the same events occur again&quot; and that &quot;nothing was entirely new&quot;. Eudemus of Rhodes also references this Pythagorean doctrine in his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot;. In a fragment preserved by Simplicius, Eudemus writes:

===Stoicism===
The Stoics, possibly inspired by the Pythagoreans, incorporated the theory of eternal recurrence into their natural philosophy. According to Stoic physics, the universe is periodically destroyed in an immense conflagration (&quot;ekpyrosis&quot;), and then experiences a rebirth (&quot;palingenesis&quot;). These cycles continue for eternity, and the same events are exactly repeated in every cycle. The Stoics may have found support for this doctrine in the concept of the Great Year, the oldest known expression of which is found in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;. Plato hypothesised that one complete cycle of time would be fulfilled when the sun, moon and planets all completed their various circuits and returned to their original positions.

Sources differ as to whether the Stoics believed that the contents of each new universe would be one and the same with those of the previous universe, or only so similar as to be indistinguishable. The former point of view was attributed to the Stoic Chrysippus (c. 279 – c. 206 BC) by Alexander of Aphrodisias, who wrote:

On the other hand, Origen (c. 185 – c. 253 AD) characterises the Stoics as claiming that the contents of each cycle will not be identical, but only indistinguishable:

Origen also records a heterodox version of the doctrine, noting that some Stoics suggest that &quot;there is a slight and very minute difference between one period and the events in the period before it&quot;. This was probably not a widely-held belief, as it represents a denial of the deterministic viewpoint which stands at the heart of Stoic philosophy.

===Christian response===
Christian authors attacked the doctrine of eternal recurrence on various grounds. Origen argued that the theory was incompatible with free will (although he did allow the possibility of diverse and non-identical cycles). Augustine of Hippo (AD 354–430) objected to the fact that salvation was not possible in the Stoic scheme, arguing that even if a temporary happiness was attained, a soul could not be truly blessed if it was doomed to return again to misery.

Augustine also mentions &quot;certain philosophers&quot; who cite Ecclesiastes 1:9–10 as evidence of eternal return: &quot;What is that which hath been? It is that which shall be. And what is that which is done? It is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Who can speak and say, See, this is new? It hath been already of old time, which was before us.&quot; Augustine denies that this has reference to the recurrence of specific people, objects, and events, instead interpreting the passage in a more general sense. In support of his argument, he appeals to scriptural passages such as Romans 6:9, which affirms that Christ &quot;being raised from the dead dieth no more&quot;.

== Friedrich Nietzsche ==
Eternal recurrence () is one of the central concepts of the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900). While the idea itself is not original to Nietzsche, his unique response to it gave new life to the theory, and speculation as to the correct interpretation of Nietzsche&#x27;s doctrine continues to this day.

===Precursors===
The discovery of the laws of thermodynamics in the 19th century restarted the debate among scientists and philosophers about the ultimate fate of the universe, which brought in its train many questions about the nature of time. Eduard von Hartmann argued that the universe&#x27;s final state would be identical to the state in which it had begun; Eugen Dühring rejected this idea, claiming that it carried with it the necessary consequence that the universe would begin again, and that the same forms would repeat themselves eternally, a doctrine which Dühring viewed as dangerously pessimistic. , on the other hand, argued in favour of a cyclical system, additionally positing the spatial co-existence of an infinite number of identical worlds. Louis Auguste Blanqui similarly claimed that in an infinite universe, every possible combination of forms must repeat itself eternally across both time and space.

===Nietzsche&#x27;s formulation===
Nietzsche may have drawn upon a number of sources in developing his own formulation of the theory. He had studied Pythagorean and Stoic philosophy, was familiar with the works of contemporary philosophers such as Dühring and Vogt, and may have encountered references to Blanqui in a book by Friedrich Albert Lange. He was also a fan of the author Heinrich Heine, one of whose books contains a passage discussing the theory of eternal return. Nevertheless, Nietzsche claimed that the doctrine struck him one day as a sudden revelation, while walking beside Lake Silvaplana in Switzerland.

The first published presentation of Nietzsche&#x27;s version of the theory appears in &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, section 341, where it is proposed to the reader as a thought experiment.

Nietzsche expanded upon this concept in the philosophical novel &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, later writing that eternal return was &quot;the fundamental idea of the work&quot;. In this novel, the titular Zarathustra is initially struck with horror at the thought that all things must recur eternally; ultimately, however, he overcomes his aversion to eternal return and embraces it as his most fervent desire. In the penultimate chapter of the work (&quot;The Drunken Song&quot;), Zarathustra declares: &quot;All things are entangled, ensnared, enamored; if you ever wanted one thing twice, if you ever said, &#x27;You please me, happiness! Abide, moment!&#x27; then you wanted &quot;all&quot; back ... &quot;For all joy wants—eternity&quot;.&quot;

===Interpretation===
Martin Heidegger points out that Nietzsche&#x27;s first mention of eternal recurrence in &quot;The Gay Science&quot; presents this concept as a hypothetical question rather than postulating it as a fact. Many readings argue that Nietzsche was not attempting to make a cosmological or theoretical claim i.e. saying that eternal recurrence is a true statement about how the world works. Instead, the emotional reaction to the thought experiment serves to reveal whether one is living life to the best. According to Heidegger, the significant point is the burden imposed by the &quot;question&quot; of eternal recurrence, regardless of whether or not such a thing could possibly be true. The idea is similar to Nietzsche&#x27;s concept of &quot;amor fati&quot;, which he describes in &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;: &quot;My formula for greatness in a human being is &quot;amor fati&quot;: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to bear what is necessary, still less conceal it ... but &quot;love&quot; it.&quot;

On the other hand, Nietzsche&#x27;s posthumously published notebooks contain an attempt at a logical proof of eternal return, which is often adduced in support of the claim that Nietzsche believed in the theory as a real possibility. The proof is based upon the premise that the universe is infinite in duration, but contains a finite quantity of energy. This being the case, all matter in the universe must pass through a finite number of combinations, and each series of combinations must eventually repeat in the same order, thereby creating &quot;a circular movement of absolutely identical series&quot;. However, scholars such as Neil Sinhababu and Kuong Un Teng have suggested that the reason this material remained unpublished was because Nietzsche himself was unconvinced that his argument would hold up to scrutiny.

A third possibility is that Nietzsche was attempting to create a new ethical standard by which people should judge their own behaviour. In one of his unpublished notes, Nietzsche writes: &quot;The question which thou wilt have to answer before every deed that thou doest: &#x27;is this such a deed as I am prepared to perform an incalculable number of times?&#x27; is the best ballast.&quot; Taken in this sense, the doctrine has been compared to the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant. Once again, however, the objection is raised that no such ethical imperative appears in any of Nietzsche&#x27;s published writings, and this interpretation is therefore rejected by most modern scholars.

==P. D. Ouspensky==
Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky (1878–1947) believed in the literal truth of eternal recurrence. As a child, he had been prone to vivid sensations of &quot;déjà vu&quot;, and when he encountered the theory of eternal return in the writings of Nietzsche, it occurred to him that this was a possible explanation for his experiences. He subsequently explored the idea in his semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Strange Life of Ivan Osokin&quot;.

In this story, Ivan Osokin implores a magician to send him back to his childhood and give him the chance to live his life over again. The magician obliges, but warns Ivan that he will be unable to correct any of his mistakes. This turns out to be the case; although Ivan always knows in advance what the outcome of his actions will be, he is unable to keep himself from repeating those actions. Having re-lived his life up to the point of his conversation with the magician, Ivan asks in despair whether there is any way of changing the past. The magician answers that he must first change himself; if he works on improving his character, he may have a chance of making better decisions next time around.

The earliest version of the novel, however, did not include the magician, and ended on &quot;a totally pessimistic note&quot;. The revolution in Ouspensky&#x27;s thoughts on recurrence – the idea that change is possible – took place after he became a disciple of the mystic George Gurdjieff, who taught that a person could achieve a higher state of consciousness through a system of strict self-discipline. When Ouspensky asked about eternal recurrence, Gurdjieff told him:

Ouspensky incorporated this idea into his later writings. In &quot;A New Model of the Universe&quot;, he argued against Nietzsche&#x27;s proof of the mathematical necessity of eternal repetition, claiming that a large enough quantity of matter would be capable of an infinite number of possible combinations. According to Ouspensky, everyone is reborn again into the same life at the moment of their death, and many people will indeed continue to live the exact same lives for eternity, but it is also possible to break the cycle and enter into a new plane of existence.

==Science and mathematics==
The Poincaré recurrence theorem states that certain dynamical systems, such as particles of gas in a sealed container, will return infinitely often to a state arbitrarily close to their original state. The theorem, first advanced by Henri Poincaré in 1890, remains influential, and is today the basis of ergodic theory. Attempts have been made to prove or disprove the possibility of Poincaré recurrence in a system the size of a galaxy or a universe. Philosopher Michael Huemer has argued that if this is so, then reincarnation can be proved by a person&#x27;s current existence, using Bayesian probability theory.

<doc id="863920" wikidata="Q6130882" url="?curid=863920" title="Jim Callaghan (Lancashire politician)">
<text>James Callaghan (28 January 1927 – 29 March 2018) was a British Labour Party politician who was a member of parliament between 1974 and 1997.

==Early life==
Callaghan was educated at Manchester and London universities, and he worked as a lecturer in art at St John&#x27;s College, Manchester, before entering Parliament.

==Political career==
At the February 1974 general election, Callaghan was elected as the member of parliament (MP) for Middleton and Prestwich. He served this constituency and its successor, Heywood and Middleton, until he retired in 1997. He was a member of several House of Commons Select Committees – on Transport, on the Cardiff Barrage scheme, and on Education, Science &amp; the Arts.

He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Joel Barnett, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He was removed from this role in March 1976, after abstaining in a division on spending cuts which the Government lost, forcing a vote of confidence against Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He later also served as PPS to the Sports Minister Denis Howell.

He was a member of the Tribune Group of Labour MPs.

==Death==
Callaghan died on 29 March 2018 at the age of 91.

<doc id="863923" wikidata="Q788880" url="?curid=863923" title="Mr. Terrific (TV series)">
<text>Mr. Terrific is an American television sitcom that aired on CBS on Mondays at 8:00 p.m., from January 9 to August 28, 1967. Stephen Strimpell starred in the title role. A similar series on NBC, &quot;Captain Nice&quot;, also aired that season on Mondays, at 8:30 p.m.

The show was an attempt to capitalize on the &quot;camp superhero&quot; craze sparked by the success of the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; TV series.

==Premise==
Riding the tide of the camp superhero craze of the 1960s, the show&#x27;s premise involved gas station attendant Stanley Beamish (Strimpell), a mild-mannered scrawny youth who secretly worked to fight crime for a government organization, &quot;The Bureau of Secret Projects,&quot; in Washington. All he needed to do was to take a &quot;power pill&quot; which gave him the strength of a thousand men and enabled him to fly, much like Superman, albeit by furious flapping while wearing the top half of a wingsuit. To the often-lamented misfortune of the Bureau of Secret Projects, he was the only person on whom the pills worked. It was established that, although the pill would give him high strength levels, he was still vulnerable to bullets. Furthermore, each power pill had a time limit of one hour (like &quot;Underdog&quot; and DC Comics&#x27;s Hourman), although he generally had two 10-minute booster pills available per episode. Much of the show&#x27;s humor revolved around the tendency of the amiable yet gullible Beamish to lose Mr. Terrific&#x27;s powers at inopportune times, before he completed his given assignment.

Beamish&#x27;s government employers were Mr. Barton J. Reed and Mr. Harley Trent, and his day-job partner at the service station was Hal Walters. Beamish was sworn to secrecy concerning his alter-ego and super-powers.

Alan Young, who had just completed his run as Wilbur Post on &quot;Mister Ed,&quot; was the original choice to play Stanley H. Beamish, and appeared in the original 1966 unaired version of the pilot, which featured a different supporting cast (Edward Andrews as The Chief, All Checco as Dr. Kramer, Dick Merrifield as Tony Lawrence, Sheilah Wells as Gloria Dickinson, and Jesse White as Mr. Finney).

<text>Mister Terrific is the name of two superheroes in the DC Comics Universe.

The original Golden Age hero, Terry Sloane, was a millionaire with a photographic memory and athletic skills who became the superhero after rescuing a woman from suicide. He formed the &quot;Fair Play Club&quot; to combat juvenile delinquency and was a member of the Justice Society of America. He was killed in a 1979 story.

The second Mister Terrific debuted in 1997. Michael Holt was inspired by Sloane&#x27;s story. Also highly skilled and intelligent, Holt invented the T-Sphere, a versatile device controlled by his mask and earpieces. He served in the Justice Society of America and had a short-lived standalone comic book series. The &quot;Mister Terrific&quot; concept was also adapted into other versions and storylines.

Edi Gathegi will play Michael Holt / Mister Terrific in the DC Universe (DCU) film &quot;Superman&quot;.

==Versions==
===Terry Sloane===

The Golden Age&#x27;s Mister Terrific was Terry Sloane, a self-made millionaire whose photographic memory, Olympic-level athletic skills, and mastery of the martial arts made him a Renaissance man. The character first appeared in &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; #1 (January 1942).

After graduating college at age 13, he eventually became a renowned business leader in the community. Having accomplished all his goals, he felt there were no challenges left for him to pursue, leading him towards suicidal tendencies. However, upon seeing a young woman jump from a bridge, Sloane reacted quickly and saved the woman, Wanda Wilson. Sloane assisted Wanda&#x27;s brother, who had been caught up in a gang, by adopting a superhero identity: the Mister Terrific persona. This provided him with what he had been missing; a sense of accomplishment. He then created the &quot;Fair Play Club&quot; to stymie growing juvenile delinquency. He also became an active member of the Justice Society of America until the team was dissolved when the House Un-American Activities Committee ordered them to reveal their secret identities or disband. In the end, they chose the latter to protect themselves and their families from potential retribution from those they had fought in the past if their identities became known. Following the dissolution of the JSA, Mr. Terrific retired along with many of the others.

Years later, Sloane came out of retirement and joined with the reformed Justice Society of America. While attending their annual meeting with the Justice League of America, he was killed by his old enemy the Spirit King, who had possessed the body of Jay Garrick to infiltrate the JLA&#x27;s satellite headquarters.

===Michael Holt===

In 1997, the mantle of Mister Terrific was passed on to Michael Holt, an equally talented man who holds five black belts, has won the Olympic Decathlon and holds many degrees and doctorates in a wide spectrum of fields. While contemplating suicide after the accidental death of his wife and unborn child, he was met by the Spectre, who told him about Terry Sloane. Inspired by Sloane&#x27;s life story, he took the name &quot;Mister Terrific&quot; and later joined the current Justice Society of America, eventually serving as its chairman. He is the inventor of the T-Sphere, an artificially intelligent miniature device that he controls with his mask and earpieces. The T-Sphere can fly, create holographic images, project beams of light, release electrical charges, hack into computers and GPS satellites, and constantly cloaks Holt against detection and the recording of his image by any and all technological, non-organic means making him virtually invisible to everything but human line of sight. In the past, he has used them for reconnaissance, infiltration, espionage and information retrieval and storage, often multi-tasking his T-Spheres to all go off on different tasks at once. He can also use his T-Spheres offensively as projectiles and has stated as a threat to an opponent that he can instantly accelerate them to 14 miles per second (50,400 miles per hour) so when it hits them, it would cause a tremendous release of energy, turning around 70% of their corporeal being into super-heated plasma and liquifying the rest. Whether this has ever been tested or was just a bluff is unknown, but considering that his opponent wasn&#x27;t real, much less alive, Mr. Terrific would have had no moral difficulties in using this option if it came down to it. While in costume, Mr. Terrific has no fewer than three T-Spheres orbiting his body at all times and has had as many as ten. He is also considered the third-smartest man alive.

Holt served as the White King in the restructured Checkmate but eventually returned to full-time duties with the JSA. However, Holt was apparently killed in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; #30/31 (Aug/Sept 2009), but returned to the land of the living shortly afterwards.

In 2011, Holt became the title character in his own Mister Terrific comic book, as part of The New 52, but this was a short run, ending in 2012 after eight issues. He has since appeared in the DC book Earth 2 following his series&#x27;s cancellation, along with the new incarnation of Terry Sloane.

Here, Terry Sloane was portrayed as a World War II intelligence agent transferred to desk duty, until the untimely death of his fiance by the story&#x27;s version of the Scarecrow.

<doc id="863930" wikidata="Q751580" url="?curid=863930" title="Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Belfast North is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons. The current MP is John Finucane (Sinn Féin).

==Boundaries==

1885–1918: In the Borough of Belfast, that part of Dock ward bounded on the south-east by a line drawn along the centre of North Queen Street, on the north-east by a line drawn along the centre of New Lodge Road, on the south-west by a line drawn along the centre of Limestone Road and York Road, and on the east by a line drawn along the centre of Carrickfergus Road, and that part of St. Anne&#x27;s ward not in the constituency of Belfast West, and the townlands of Ballygomartin, Ballysillan Lower, Greencastle, Legoniel, Lowwood, Old Park and Skegoneill in the parish of Shankill, along with that part of the townland of Ballyaghagan within the parliamentary borough.

1922–1974: The County Borough of Belfast wards of Clifton, Duncairn, and Shankill.

1974–1983: The County Borough of Belfast wards of Clifton, Dock, Duncairn, and Shankill.

1983–1997: The District of Belfast wards of Ardoyne, Ballysillan, Bellevue, Castleview, Cavehill, Cliftonville, Crumlin, Duncairn, Fortwilliam, Grove, Legoniel, New Lodge, Shankill, and Woodvale.

1997–2010: The District of Belfast wards of Ardoyne, Ballysillan, Bellevue, Castleview, Cavehill, Chichester Park, Cliftonville, Crumlin, Duncairn, Fortwilliam, Legoniel, New Lodge, Water Works, and Woodvale, and the District of Newtownabbey wards of Abbey, Coole, Dunanney, Valley, and Whitehouse.

2010–present: The District of Belfast wards of Ardoyne, Ballysillan, Bellevue, Castleview, Cavehill, Chichester Park, Cliftonville, Crumlin, Duncairn, Fortwilliam, Legoniel, New Lodge, Water Works, and Woodvale, and the District of Newtownabbey wards of Abbey, Ballyhenry, Cloughfern, Collinbridge, Coole, Dunanney, Glebe, Glengormley, Hightown, Valley, and Whitehouse.

The seat was recreated in 1922 when, as part of the establishment of the devolved Stormont Parliament for Northern Ireland, the number of MPs in the Westminster Parliament was drastically cut. The seat is centred on the north section of Belfast, though at times the area around the Docks on the north side of the Lagan Estuary has instead been part of variously Belfast East and Belfast West. Belfast North also contains part of the district of Newtownabbey.

Belfast North contains 14 wards of Belfast City Council and 5 of Newtownabbey Borough Council. The constituency suffered the highest level of violence in Northern Ireland during The Troubles and covers many areas synonymous with the conflict – the New Lodge, Ardoyne, Rathcoole, Ballysillan and Woodvale. The overall tenor of the constituency is working-class, with a high proportion of residents in public housing, and concentrations of low-income single people in the middle Antrim Road and Cliftonville areas. There are some upscale residential areas around Belfast Castle and on the slopes of Cavehill. Sectarian divisions are stark, with a number of Peace lines cutting through the constituency and occasional outbursts of sectarian street violence, and was the focus for post-ceasefire incidents such as the Holy Cross dispute.

At the boundary commission hearings in September 2005 prior to the 2010 general election, the SDLP proposed extending the seat to Cloughfern and Jordanstown. The DUP supported the addition of Cloughfern. Sinn Féin were generally supportive of the commission&#x27;s proposals.

Following the revised recommendations, the Commission proposals were finalised and accepted by Parliament through the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order.

==History==
Belfast North is a constituency with a nationalist majority. Belfast North historically had a narrow unionist majority, which gradually decreased over time. The nationalist vote is considerable, and those from a Catholic background (47%) now slightly outnumber those from a Protestant background (46%), according to the 2011 census. It has generated particular interest for a number of highly unusual election results, as well as for several candidates and MPs prominently disagreeing with their parties.

Of the five main political parties in Northern Ireland, four (the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Sinn Féin) all have relatively strong support bases and routinely poll similar results. Other parties such as the Alliance, Progressive Unionist Party, Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, Conservatives and the Workers&#x27; Party have at times polled significantly, as have independent candidates, with the result that many elections have been won on comparatively low shares of the vote. The elections to the various assemblies have often seen the seats for the constituency heavily split – in 1998 no party won more than one Assembly seat.

The area saw a steady out movement of Protestants during the Troubles, to some degree replaced by a growing Catholic population, although the overall population of the area fell sharply. However, all the inner-city communities in the constituency are now haemorrhaging electors, and the overall ethnic composition of the constituency now seems stable.

The seat was consistently held by the Ulster Unionist Party from its creation until the 1970s. In 1972 the first notable dissent occurred when the sitting MP, Stratton Mills, dissented from the UUP&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the Conservative whip at Westminster over the suspension of the Stormont Parliament. Mills remained as a Conservative MP, but the following year he joined the Alliance, giving them their only Westminster representation before 2010.

In the February 1974 general election the seat was won by John Carson of the Ulster Unionist Party with backing by the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party on a united slate in opposition to the Sunningdale Agreement. Carson&#x27;s victory came despite a majority of votes being cast for pro-Sunningdale candidates, albeit split between the Pro-Assembly Unionists, the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Northern Ireland Labour Party. Carson held his seat in the October 1974 election but was deselected by the local Ulster Unionists over his support for the minority Labour government.

The 1979 general election saw one of the most dramatic results of all when Johnny McQuade of the Democratic Unionist Party won the seat with a mere 27.6% of the vote – the third lowest total for a successful candidate in a UK general election in the twentieth century. This came about due to the strong showing of several other parties, dividing the vote strongly. McQuade also had the distinction of being the oldest person to be initially elected to Westminster in the 20th century and did not stand at the next general election.

In 1983, Cecil Walker regained the seat for the UUP, beating Scotsman George Seawright of the DUP. In the 1987 general election the UUP and DUP agreed a pact in opposition to the Anglo Irish Agreement. Seawright had been expelled from the DUP and stood in the election, reviving the Protestant Unionist Party label, but was unsuccessful.

Walker continued to hold the seat until 2001 but gained a reputation for inactivity. In the 2001 general election the DUP contested the seat for the first time since 1983, with their candidate Nigel Dodds campaigning heavily on both their opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and Walker&#x27;s record. Walker also suffered from a disastrous television interview during the campaign. In the election Walker&#x27;s vote collapsed to a mere 12%, coming fourth whilst Dodds won the seat. The UUP vote fell even further in both the 2003 Assembly election and the 2005 general election.

Nigel Dodds became the DUP&#x27;s deputy leader and Commons leader in 2008, but the 2010 general election saw Sinn Féin increase their vote share and reduce the DUP majority. Sinn Féin targeted the seat in the 2015 general election, campaigning on returning the constituency&#x27;s first Irish nationalist MP and the growing Catholic population surpassing Protestants. However, the DUP and the UUP agreed an electoral pact in which the UUP would withdraw their candidate to help re-elect an unionist. This allowed for Dodds to hold the seat comfortably with an increased majority, although a 4.3% swing to Sinn Féin in the 2017 general election still confirmed the seat&#x27;s marginal status.

Prior to the 2019 general election, the SDLP and UUP withdrew their candidates. In a highly divisive contest marred by threats from loyalist paramilitaries, John Finucane of Sinn Féin won with a majority of 1,943 votes. This meant that the 2019 election was the first time that Sinn Féin won multiple seats in Belfast and the first time Belfast North had elected a nationalist instead of a unionist. Dodds was replaced as Commons leader by Jeffrey Donaldson.

<text>MusicXML is an XML-based file format for representing Western musical notation. The format is open, fully documented, and can be freely used under the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement.

==History==
MusicXML was invented by Michael Good and initially developed by Recordare LLC. It derived several key concepts from existing academic formats (such as Walter Hewlett&#x27;s ASCII-based MuseData and David Huron&#x27;s Humdrum). It is designed for the interchange of scores, particularly between different scorewriters. MusicXML development was managed by MakeMusic following the company&#x27;s acquisition of Recordare in 2011. MusicXML development was transferred to the W3C Music Notation Community Group in July 2015.

Version 1.0 was released in January 2004. Version 1.1 was released in May 2005 with improved formatting support. Version 2.0 was released in June 2007 and included a standard compressed format. All of these versions were defined by a series of document type definitions (DTDs). An XML Schema Definition (XSD) implementation of Version 2.0 was released in September 2008. Version 3.0 was released in August 2011 with improved virtual instrument support, in both DTD and XSD versions. Version 3.1 was released in December 2017 with improved support for the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL). Version 4.0 was released in June 2021 and resolved multiple issues.

The MusicXML DTDs and XSDs are each freely redistributable under the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement.

==Support==
, over 270 notation programs have at least some MusicXML interchange capability. These programs include:
* Most scorewriting programs, including Finale, Dorico, Sibelius, and MuseScore
* Most optical music recognition programs, including SmartScore, PhotoScore and Audiveris
* Most music sequencer programs, including Cubase, Logic Pro, Digital Performer, and SONAR
Additionally, web support is possible through the use of the HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript resulting in the rendering of legible music within a web browser.

Features include key and time signatures, clefs, beaming information, stem directions, slurs, ornaments, barlines, and written repeats.

==Example==
Like all XML-based formats, MusicXML is intended to be easy for automated tools to parse and manipulate. Though it is possible to create MusicXML by hand, interactive score writing programs like Finale and MuseScore greatly simplify the reading, writing, and modifying of MusicXML files.
The following example is a score consisting of a single whole note middle C in the key of C major on the treble clef.

 &lt;beat-type&gt;4&lt;/beat-type&gt;
 &lt;/time&gt;
 &lt;clef&gt;
 &lt;sign&gt;G&lt;/sign&gt;
 &lt;line&gt;2&lt;/line&gt;
 &lt;/clef&gt;
 &lt;/attributes&gt;
 &lt;note&gt;
 &lt;pitch&gt;
 &lt;step&gt;C&lt;/step&gt;
 &lt;octave&gt;4&lt;/octave&gt;
 &lt;/pitch&gt;
 &lt;duration&gt;4&lt;/duration&gt;
 &lt;type&gt;whole&lt;/type&gt;
 &lt;/note&gt;
 &lt;/measure&gt;
 &lt;/part&gt;
&lt;/score-partwise&gt;
The textual representation listed above is verbose; MusicXML v2.0 addresses this by adding a compressed zip format with a suffix that can make files roughly one-twentieth the size of the uncompressed version.

<text>Stanley Charles Waters (June 14, 1920 – September 25, 1991) was a Canadian lieutenant-general and politician. Appointed to his Senate seat following a non-binding provincial Senate election, he has been called Canada&#x27;s &quot;first elected senator&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Winnipeg and educated at Strathcona High School and the University of Alberta, Waters commissioned into the 14th Army Tank Battalion (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)) in 1941. He was then posted to the First Special Service Force. In 1943, using scaling ropes, Waters led his unit up the sheer cliffs of Monte la Difensa to attack German defences. In February 1944 he landed at Anzio and, due to Allied losses, temporarily took command of a battalion.

After the war, he rose steadily through the ranks, and ended his career as a lieutenant-general and Commander of Mobile Command (1973–75). In 1975, he joined Mannix Organization at Calgary, becoming president of Loram Group, a subsidiary of the parent company. He was a co-founder of the Bowfort Group of Companies, which engage in farming, real estate and investment operations throughout Western Canada. He held a variety of executive positions until his retirement from business in 1989. Waters also was the president of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce and in 1984 organized a group to purchase a partial share of the Calgary Stampeders football club.

==Political career==
Stan Waters was also keenly interested in Canadian politics. In 1987, Waters became a founding member of Preston Manning&#x27;s Reform Party of Canada. While Waters did not choose to participate as a Reform Party candidate in the federal election of 1988, he was seen as one of the party&#x27;s most popular early spokesmen and policy communicators, speaking at numerous party rallies and events from 1987 to 1991.

In 1989, under strain from the troubling and complex wrangling surrounding the Meech Lake Accord and constitutional amendment talks, Alberta Premier Don Getty called for a Senate election. Stan Waters came forward as the Reform Party of Alberta candidate for the open Alberta Senate seat. On October 16, 1989, he received 41.7% of the more than 620,000 non-binding votes cast by Albertans in his bid to go to Ottawa. Although it was a non-binding result, he was selected as the first person to be elected by a provincial population to be the Prime Minister&#x27;s recommendation to the Governor General for appointment to the Senate. He represented the senate division of Alberta. Pressured by Getty and Reform, with Deborah Grey promising that if &quot;we don&#x27;t get this seat, we&#x27;ll get 10 in the next election&quot;, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney agreed to advise Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn to appoint Waters to the Canadian Senate.

On June 11, 1990, Stan Waters was sworn into the Senate. He was also the first representative of the Reform Party in the Upper House. During his year-long tenure as a senator, Waters spoke for Western Canadian and conservative values. He pushed for an end to official bilingualism, urged health care reform, opposed federal funding grants to artists and fervently pushed the Mulroney Government to adopt a &quot;Triple-E Senate&quot; (elected, effective and equal) during the constitutional debates of 1990–91. On the abortion issue, Waters was pro-choice, which put him somewhat at odds with the Reform Party&#x27;s conservative Christian supporters.

==Death and legacy==
Waters was admitted to the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary to treat in July 1991, and later died of complications at Foothills on September 25.

After Waters&#x27; death, Alberta Premier Don Getty lauded his contribution towards Senate reform, calling the momentum created by his election &quot;unstoppable&quot;.

When the federal Liberal Party was returned to power in the 1993 election under party leader Jean Chrétien, Senate reform was all but abandoned. Chrétien and his successor, Paul Martin, did not advise the appointment to the Senate of candidates elected by Albertans in 1998 and 2004, citing the fact that the elections are not part of the Senate selection process, as defined by the Constitution of Canada.

<doc id="863945" wikidata="Q7698927" url="?curid=863945" title="Temporal multithreading">
<text>Temporal multithreading is one of the two main forms of multithreading that can be implemented on computer processor hardware, the other being simultaneous multithreading. The distinguishing difference between the two forms is the maximum number of concurrent threads that can execute in any given pipeline stage in a given cycle. In temporal multithreading the number is one, while in simultaneous multithreading the number is greater than one. Some authors use the term super-threading synonymously.

==Variations==
There are many possible variations of temporal multithreading, but most can be classified into two sub-forms:

;Coarse-grained: The main processor pipeline contains only one thread at a time. The processor must effectively perform a rapid context switch before executing a different thread. This fast context switch is sometimes referred to as a &quot;thread switch&quot;. There may or may not be additional penalty cycles when switching.

:There are many possible variations of coarse-grained temporal multithreading, mainly concerning the algorithm that determines when thread switching occurs. This algorithm may be based on one or more of many different factors, including cycle counts, cache misses, and fairness.

;Fine-grained (or interleaved): The main processor pipeline may contain multiple threads, with context switches effectively occurring between pipe stages (e.g., in the barrel processor). This form of multithreading can be more expensive than the coarse-grained forms because execution resources that span multiple pipe stages may have to deal with multiple threads. Also contributing to cost is the fact that this design cannot be optimized around the concept of a &quot;background&quot; thread — any of the concurrent threads implemented by the hardware might require its state to be read or written on any cycle.

==Comparison to simultaneous multithreading==
In any of its forms, temporal multithreading is similar in many ways to simultaneous multithreading. As in the simultaneous process, the hardware must store a complete set of states per concurrent thread implemented. The hardware must also preserve the illusion that a given thread has the processor resources to itself. Fairness algorithms must be included in both types of multithreading situations to prevent one thread from dominating processor time and/or resources.

Temporal multithreading has an advantage over simultaneous multithreading in that it causes lower processor heat output; however, it allows only one thread to be executed at a time.

<doc id="863946" wikidata="Q441650" url="?curid=863946" title="Popular Alliance (San Marino)">
<text>The Popular Alliance (, AP) was a liberal-centrist political party in San Marino. The party formed a coalition with the Union for the Republic for the 2016 Sammarinese general election, and following their electoral success the two parties created a new party, Future Republic.

==History==
AP was born as an anti-establishment party in 1993, in parallel with the rise of Lega Nord in Italy, of which it has been long considered the Sanmarinese counterpart, but has since then become a stable political force in San Marino, participating in government coalitions with the centrist Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS), as well as with the centre-left Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD) since 2002.

In the 2006 Sammarinese general election the party won 12.1% of the vote and 7 out of 60 seats in the Grand and General Council, making it the third-largest party of the country. In 2008 after the breaking-up of the governing coalition, due to the rising clashes between AP and United Left, under the new electoral system, the party decided to join PDCS in the centrist Pact for San Marino coalition for the 2008 general election, gaining 11.5% of votes and 7 seats out of the 35 of the coalition gained and 11.52% of the national vote. Assunta Meloni became one of the two Joint Captains Regent of San Marino.

After the political crisis of 2011, AP confirmed its alliance with PDCS, creating the new alliance San Marino Common Good, which won the 2012 Sammarinese general election, even though AP itself lost three seats.

For the 2016 Sammarinese general election, AP broke its alliance with PDCS and formed the Future Republic electoral list with Union for the Republic, which was a part of the &quot;Adesso.sm&quot; coalition. The list won eleven seats in the election&#x27;s second round run-off.

On 24 February 2017, AP and UpR officially merged and formed Future Republic as a political party.

<doc id="863950" wikidata="Q7233539" url="?curid=863950" title="Post-expressionism">
<text>Post-expressionism is a term coined by the German art critic Franz Roh to describe a variety of movements in the post-war art world which were influenced by expressionism but defined themselves through rejecting its aesthetic. Roh first used the term in an essay in 1925, &quot;Magic Realism: Post-Expressionism&quot;, to contrast to Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub&#x27;s &quot;New Objectivity&quot;, which more narrowly characterized these developments within German art. Though Roh saw &quot;post-expressionism&quot; and &quot;magic realism&quot; as synonymous, later critics characterized distinctions between magic realism and other artists initially identified by Hartlaub and have also pointed out other artists in Europe who had different stylistic tendencies but were working within the same trend.

==Background==
Leading up to World War I, much of the art world was under the influence of Futurism and Expressionism. Both movements abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition.

The sentiment of Futurists was most vocally expressed by Filippo Marinetti in the &quot;Futurist Manifesto&quot;, where he called for a rejection of the past, a rejection of all imitation — of other artists or of the outside world — and praised the virtue of originality and triumph of technology. The Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, along these lines, said “After seeing electricity, I lost interest in nature.” Marinetti and other Futurists glorified war and violence as a way to revolution – bringing freedom, establishing new ideas, and rallying one to fight for one&#x27;s own people – and as war was shaping up in Europe, many saw it and encouraged a way to “purify” the culture and destroy old, obsolete elements of society.

Expressionists, likewise abandoning imitation nature, sought to express emotional experience, but often centered their art around angst — inner turmoil; whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled &quot;Menschheitsdämmerung&quot;, which translates to “Dawn of Humanity” — meant to suggest that humanity was in a &#x27;twilight&#x27;; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.

Both futurism and expressionism were always met by opposition, but the destruction that occurred in the war had heightened the criticism against them. Following the war, in and throughout different artistic circles there was a call for a return to order and re-appreciation of tradition and of the natural world. In Italy, this was encouraged by the magazine &quot;Valori Plastici&quot; and came together in the Novecento, a group that exhibited in the Venice Biennale and was joined by many Futurists who had rejected their former work. Mario Sironi, a member of this group, stated that they “would not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it.” The “New Objectivity” or &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot;, as coined by Hartlaub, described the developments in Germany and became the title of an exhibition that he staged in 1925. &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; was influenced not only by the “return to order” but also a call to arms among more left-leaning artists who wanted to use their art in a forward, political manner that expressionism didn&#x27;t enable them to do. In Belgium, there was another vein in the common trend, which would later be referred to as a “retour à l’humain”.

==Movements==
When Hartlaub defined the idea of the &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot;, he identified two groups: the &quot;verists&quot;, who “[tore] the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature,” and the &quot;classicists&quot;, who “[searched] more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere.”

Although Roh originally meant the term &#x27;Magic Realism&#x27; to be more or less synonymous with &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot;, the artists identified by Hartlaub as &#x27;classicists&#x27; later became associated with Roh&#x27;s term. These &#x27;Magic Realists&#x27; were all influenced by the classicism developed in Italy by the Novecento, and in turn by de Chirico&#x27;s concept of &quot;metaphysical art&quot;, which had also branched into surrealism. Art critic Wieland Schmeid in 1977 posited that despite the fact that the terms were meant to refer to the same thing, the understanding of them as different groups derives from the fact that the movement had a right and left wing, with the Magic Realists on the right — many later supporting fascism or accommodating to it— and the &quot;verists&quot; we associate as the &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; on the left — fighting against fascism. The two groups in addition to having different political philosophies likewise had different artistic philosophies.

The third movement that is important to include in post-expressionism, and which Roh excluded, is the reaction to Flemish Expressionism, as opposed to strains of German expressionism and Italian futurism. This is typically referred to as &quot;animism&quot;.

===Magic Realism===

&#x27;Magic Realism&#x27; for Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, meant to declare “[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.” With the term, he was emphasizing the “magic” of the normal world as it presents itself to us — how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic.

In Italy, the style that Roh identified was created by a confluence of a renewed focus on harmony and technique called for by the “return to order” and &quot;metaphysical art&quot;, a style which had been developed by Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico, two members of the Novecento. Carrà described his purpose as to explore the imagined inner life of familiar objects when represented out of their explanatory contexts: their solidity, their separateness in the space allotted to them, the secret dialogue that may take place between them.

The leading painter in Italy associated with this style is perhaps Antonio Donghi, who kept to traditional subject matter — popular life, landscapes, and still life — but presented it with strong composition and spatial clarity to give it gravity and stillness. His still lifes often consist of a small vase of flowers, depicted with the disarming symmetry of naive art. He also often painted birds carefully arranged for display in their cages, and dogs and other animals ready to perform for circus acts, to suggest an artificial arrangement placed on top of nature. In Germany, Anton Räderscheidt followed a style similar to Donghi, turning to magic realism after abandoning constructivism. Georg Schrimpf is somewhat like the two, working in a style influenced by primitivism.

Filippo De Pisis, who is often associated with &quot;metaphysical art&quot;, can also be seen as a magic realist. Like Donghi, he often painted traditional subjects, but rather than developing a strict classical style, used a more painterly brush to bring out the intimacy of the objects, similar to the Belgian &quot;animists&quot;. His association with &quot;metaphysical art&quot; comes from the fact that he would often contrapose objects in his still lifes, and set them in a scene that gave them context.

Another artist in Italy considered a magic realist is Felice Casorati, whose paintings are rendered with fine technique but often distinguished by unusual perspective effects and bold colorfulness. In 1925, Rafaello Giolli summarized the disconcerting aspects of Casorati&#x27;s art — “The volumes have no weight in them, and the colors no body. Everything is fictitious: even the living lack all nervous vitality. The sun seems to be the moon ... nothing is fixed or definite.”

Other German artists who worked within this style are Alexander Kanoldt and Carl Grossberg. Kanoldt painted still lifes and portraits, while Grossberg painted urban landscapes and industrial sites rendered with chilly precision.

=== New Objectivity and Verism ===
The artists most associated with the &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; today are those Hartlaub identified as &#x27;verists&#x27;. These artists tended to oppose expressionism, but did not so much exemplify the “return to order” as much as they opposed what they saw as the political impotence of expressionist art. They sought to involve themselves into revolutionary politics and their form of realism distorted appearances to emphasize the ugly, as they wanted to expose what they considered the ugliness of reality. The art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical.

Bertolt Brecht, a German dramatist, was an early critic of Expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just like in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a &#x27;will to drama&#x27;, but no real drama. His early plays, &quot;Baal&quot; and &quot;Trommeln in der Nacht&quot; (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism. Opposed to the focus on individual emotional experience in expressionist art, Brecht began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his &quot;Man Equals Man&quot; project.

Overall, the &quot;verist&quot; critique of expressionism was influenced by Dadaism. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and in common cause, they wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest — shaking off not only the constraints of nationality, but also of artistic language, in order to express political outrage and encourage political action. Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it.

Out of this, Dada cultivated a “satirical hyperrealism”, as termed by Raoul Hausmann, and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of John Heartfield. Use of collage in these works became a &quot;compositional&quot; principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things. This later developed into portraits and scenes by artists such as George Grosz, Otto Dix, and Rudolf Schlichter. Portraits would give emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted. Satirical scenes often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon-like.

Other &quot;verist&quot; artists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad&#x27;s paintings are characterized &quot;an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin&quot;, according to Schmied. Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality to life.

===Animism===

In Belgium, expressionism had been influenced by artists like James Ensor and Louis Pevernagie who had combined expressionism with symbolism. Ensor, known for his paintings of people in masks, carnival outfits, and side-by-side with skeletons, also often painted realistic scenes, but imbued them with a fevered brush, garish colors, and strong contrasts to suggest a strange unreality present in them, as did Pevernagie. Expressionism was also exhibited in the Latemse School, where adherents like Constant Permeke and Hubert Malfait used brushwork in painting and loose form in sculpture to show a mystic reality behind nature.

In what had been called a “retour à l’humain” (return to the human), many artists working in Belgium after the war had kept the expressive brush of their forebears, but had rejected what they had seen as the anti-human, unreal distortions in their subject matter. The goal was to use the expressive brush to depict the soul or spirit of the objects, people, and places they were painting, rather than a hyperbolic, externalized, displaced angst of the artist. These artists were often characterized as &#x27;introverts&#x27;, as opposed to the &#x27;extroverts&#x27; of expressionism.

Belgian art critic Paul Haesaerts later gave this movement the title &quot;animism&quot;, which he took from anthropologist E.B. Tylor&#x27;s book &quot;Primitive Culture&quot; (1871) describing &#x27;animism&#x27; as primitive religion that based itself on the idea a soul inhabited all objects. Later, Haesaerts, driven by criticism to do so, also used the terms &quot;réalisme poétique&quot; and &quot;intimism&quot;, although &quot;animism&quot; is still most commonly used in literature. &quot;Intimism&quot; will more often refer to the art practiced by some members of the Nabis.

The most recognized painter of these artists is Henri-Victor Wolvens, who painted many scenes of the beach and ocean at Ostend. In his beach scenes, harsh waves are painted with a rough brush, clouds in patches — rougher when in storm — and the sand with a scraped quality. Figures are painted as simply as possible, often as stick figures, and given translucency and movement — so his bathers show the activity of the beach and it the activity of the bathers blend in with the motion of the waves crashing ashore.

The work of Floris Jespers was strongly influenced by an animist spirit after the war. He uses form and color to give different degrees of vividness to the subjects in his paintings, each to the degree that one would associate them with in life.

Other painters associated with this movement are Anne Bonnet, Albert Dasnoy, Henri Evenepoel, Mayou Iserentant, Jacques Maes, Marcel Stobbaerts, Albert Van Dyck, Louis Van Lint, War Van Overstraeten and Jozef Vinck.

Filippo De Pisis, referenced above, exhibited animist tendencies.

George Grard is the sculptor most associated with animism. Like expressionists, he went against both naturalism and classical tendencies, but used exaggerations from his models to heighten the feeling and sensuality of the form, and chose lyrical subjects. Grard was friends with Charles LePlae, who had a similar style, but kept more in line with natural and classical forms.

Herman De Cuyper is also associated with animism, and abstracted to a more extreme degree than did Grard or LaPlae, and in some ways is more similar to Henry Moore.

==Counter-movements==
An early revolt against the imposed classicism that was popular in the Novecento took place with the founding of the &quot;Scuola Romana&quot;.

===Romantic Expressionism===

Corrado Cagli was a member of this group, and identified himself and others whom he met as members of the “New Roman School of Painting”, or &quot;nuovi pittori romani&quot; (new Roman painters). Cagli spoke of a spreading sensitivity and an &quot;Astro di Roma&quot; (Roman Star) which guided them, affirming it as the poetic basis of their art:
Sometimes referred to as &quot;romantic expressionism&quot;, art from this group exhibits a wild painting style, expressive and disorderly, violent and with warm ochre and maroon tones. Contrary to early expressionism, the focus isn&#x27;t on angst and turmoil, but rather seeing the world anew, as Cagli described, through romantic imagination. Yet, the formal rigour of the Novecento was replaced by a distinctly expressionist visionariness.

Scipione brought to life a sort of Roman baroque expressionism, where often decadent landscapes appear of Rome&#x27;s historical baroque centre, populated by priests and cardinals, seen with a vigorously expressive and hallucinated eye.

Mario Mafai painted many scenes of Rome and its suburbs, and used warm chromatic colors to convey a sense of freshness and pictorial curiosity. This bent is particularly emphasised in his 1936-1939 work, in a series paintings entitled &quot;Demolitions&quot;, where in order to make a political statement he painted urban restructuring being carried out by the fascist regime. During the Second World War he painted a series of &quot;Fantasies&quot; depicting horrors committed by the fascists. Antonietta Raphaël, Mafai&#x27;s wife and a sculptor, was also a member of this group.

Another member was Renato Guttuso, who like Mafai made paintings which denounced the fascist regime. Guttuso&#x27;s works are generally bright, lively, and verging on abstraction.

Emanuele Cavalli and Giuseppe Capogrossi have associations both with the &quot;Scuola Romana&quot; and with Magic Realism.

<text>Uithuizermeeden is a village in the Netherlands, with a population of about 3,200 people. It is part of the municipality of Het Hogeland, close to the Wadden Sea.

The most important points are the &quot;Meijster Toren&quot; and the &quot;Rensumaborg&quot; (dated 1700, not open for public). The Meijster Toren dated from the thirteenth century, but was rebuilt at the end of the 19th century in original style, after a fire destroyed it.

It had a population of around 3,325 in January 2017.

Uithuizermeeden was a separate municipality until 1979, when it became part of Hefshuizen.

<text>Coronation chicken or Poulet Reine Elizabeth is an English dish of boneless chicken traditionally seasoned with parsley, thyme, bay leaf, cumin, turmeric, ginger and peppercorns, mixed with cream or mayonnaise, and dried apricots (or sultanas). Some modern variations also incorporate cinnamon. It is served cold and eaten as a salad with rice, peas and pimentos, or used as a filling for sandwiches. It was created by Constance Spry, an English food writer and flower arranger, and Rosemary Hume, a chef, for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

== Composition ==

Normally bright yellow, coronation chicken is traditionally flavoured with curry powder and fresh or dried herbs and spices, but may also include additional ingredients such as flaked almonds, raisins, and crème fraîche.

The original dish differs from modern versions in that it calls for apricot puree rather than raisins. The chicken is first poached in diluted, seasoned white wine, before being coated in a mayonnaise-based cream of curry sauce and arranged atop a rice salad.

== History ==
Constance Spry, an English food writer and flower arranger, and Rosemary Hume,&lt;ref name=&quot;cordonbleu.edu/coronation-chicken&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a chef, both principals of the Cordon Bleu Cookery School in London, are credited with the invention of coronation chicken. Preparing the food for the banquet of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, Hume&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/coronation-chicken-story&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is credited with the recipe of cold chicken, curry cream sauce and dressing that became known as coronation chicken.

Coronation chicken may have been inspired by jubilee chicken, a dish prepared for the silver jubilee of George V in 1935, which mixed chicken with mayonnaise and curry. Additionally, for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 2002, another celebratory dish was devised, also called Jubilee chicken.

<text>The Lancia Thema (Type 834) is an executive car produced by the Italian automaker Lancia between 1984 and 1994, and one of four cars to share the Type Four platform alongside the Alfa Romeo 164, Fiat Croma and Saab 9000. The Thema was first shown at the Turin Motor Show in 1984. The Thema was available as a saloon and as a station wagon designed and produced by Pininfarina.

In February 2011, it was reported that the second generation of the Chrysler 300C, due for launch later that year, would be marketed as Lancia Thema in all European markets, except the UK and Ireland, which would retain the 300C nameplate. It was sold from 2011 to 2014.

== First generation (1984–1994)==
===First series===

The Lancia Thema was announced in May 1984, then introduced to the motoring press with an event held in October 1984 in Vienna, and to the general public at the Turin Motor Show in November of the same year.

The first series of the Thema was built between 1984 and 1988, with four different models initially available. Two came with a twin cam 8-valve, fuel injected 4-cylinder petrol engine, in naturally aspirated guise on the Thema i.e. or turbocharged and intercooled on the Thema i.e. turbo. Power output was and respectively. The most expensive model was the Thema 6V, powered by a , V6, tuned for smoothness. On most European markets a , four-cylinder turbocharged and intercooled four-cylinder diesel engine was also available, on the Thema turbo ds. 1986 saw the introduction of the Pininfarina-designed Thema Station Wagon, available with the two turbocharged engine options only, and of the Ferrari V8-engined Thema 8·32.

===Second series===

The second series of the Thema was presented in the Paris Motor Show in September 1988. New 16-valve 2.0-litre engines replaced the previous 8-valve units, increasing the power output to on the naturally aspirated Thema i.e. 16v and to on the Thema turbo 16v. The 8-valve 2-litre, now producing , remained on sale on the Thema i.e. base model. The six-cylinder on the Thema V6 was only mildly revised. The diesel engine on the Thema turbo ds increased marginally in capacity, to , and more significantly in output, to .

A number of small visual updates were made to freshen the Thema&#x27;s look. Upfront there was a more prominent grille with vertical instead of horizontal bars, and the turn indicators had been moved beneath the main headlamp units, under horizontal dark-tinted lenses. At the rear all model badging was removed, and the turn signals and backup lamp lenses were now tinted red. Finally, the side rubbing strips, side skirts, wheel covers and 8-spoke alloy wheels were redesigned. The station wagon and the 8·32 received similar updates. With five engines available on the saloon, three on the SW (the two 16-valve petrols and the turbo diesel), the Thema range consisted of nine different models. The different models received almost no visual distinctions, aside from the 8·32. Other models looked largely identical aside from badging, wheel dimensions, and wheel design (along with body-coloured mirror housings on top versions). Additionally the 4- and 6-cylinder petrol engines were also produced in catalytic converter-equipped versions, with slightly reduced output, for sale on markets where such equipment was mandatory.

===Third series===
The series two was then replaced by the facelifted third and last series, introduced at the Paris Motor Show in September 1992 and produced from 1992 to 1994. Four trim levels—base, LE, LS and LX—were introduced across the range; the 2.9-litre V6 engine was replaced by a more powerful 3.0-litre unit, sourced from Alfa Romeo.

Production of the Thema ceased in 1994, when Lancia also withdrew entirely from RHD markets (including the United Kingdom) in response to falling sales. The Thema was replaced by the Kappa. A total of over 336,000 Thema saloons were produced.

===Variants===

====Station wagon====

In addition to the saloon, a station wagon was jointly developed and produced by Lancia and Pininfarina in Grugliasco. It was shown in prototype form at the September 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show, and in definitive form at the March 1986 Geneva Motor Show. Zagato had also shown a station wagon proposal earlier, at the 1985 Geneva Motor Show. This prototype, which remained a design study, with a larger glass area in the rear and with more discreet D-pillars than for the Pininfarina variant.

Pininfarina was also tasked with producing the new bodystyle. The Lancia factory assembled all the body-in-white parts shared with the saloon; the incomplete bodies were sent to Pininfarina, where they were completed and painted, and final assembly was carried out. The station wagon version was never offered in a right-hand drive variant. In total 21,074 Thema station wagons would be built by Pininfarina between 1986 and 1994 in their Borgo San Paolo plant.

====Thema 8·32====

First shown at the Turin Auto Show in 1986, the Lancia Thema 8·32 (&quot;8&quot; standing for the number of cylinders and &quot;32&quot; for the number of valves) was assembled at Lancia&#x27;s S. Paolo plant in Turin. It used a , Tipo F105L, Ferrari V8. This engine was based on the unit used in the Ferrari 308 GTB and in the Ferrari Mondial Quattrovalvole, and some of the components were assembled by Ducati from castings made at Maranello. The engine differed from other Ferrari V8s of the time in that it was equipped with a cross-plane type crankshaft rather than the usual flat-plane crankshaft, smaller valves and a different firing order: all this was to make the engine&#x27;s characteristics more suitable for a four-door luxury saloon. In non-catalysed form the engine produced at 6,750 rpm, and the car was capable of accelerating from 0–100 km/h in 6.8 seconds and could attain top speed of . Catalysed versions produce , which allowed for 0–100 km/h acceleration in 7.2 seconds and a top speed of . The transmission was a 5-speed manual transmission; there was no automatic option. The braking system used larger 294 mm vented front discs and the standard 251 mm rear ones from the other Thema variants.

All 8·32s featured Bosch KE3 Jetronic fuel injection, ABS, ZF&#x27;s brand new Servotronic electronically controlled rack-and-pinion power steering (which varied steering wheel effort according to vehicle speed), and a retractable rear spoiler. The latter, designed to increase high speed stability, was controlled by the driver via a rotary switch on the right stalk. In closed position, it would fit flush with the boot lid.
The tyres were specially developed 205/55 VR15 Goodyears on five-spoke 6J×15 alloy wheels.

The car offered a handmade wood-and-Alcantara (or optional Poltrona Frau leather) interior, and was complete with similar luxury equipment similar to the LX trim level of the Thema. Stitched leather covered the entire dashboard, the steering wheel (including centre), gear and handbrake levers and booths, centre console, door panels and sun visors, while the headlining was done in Alcantara. A bespoke dashboard fascia housed two main instruments, six small auxiliary gauges, and triple round air conditioning vents. Like the door cappings and the lids concealing the radio and ashtray, it was veneered in matte varnish burr wood. The instrumentation had black dials with yellow hands and markings; it included water thermometer, oil thermometer and pressure gauge, and check panels for the lights and the drivetrain. The seats (and matching door panel inserts) were trimmed in beige or date brown Alcantara as standard, with black or brown leather was an optional extra. Brown interiors got colour-matching switchgear, carpets and trim. Irrespective of interior selection, Thema 8·32 buyers could choose from five paint colours, all metallic finishes: Blizzard Blue, Winner Red, Quartz Grey, Reflex Green and Black. A double hand-painted pinstripe (the upper matched to body colour, the lower yellow) ran along the sides and the rear of the car. Besides the paint scheme, retractable spoiler and wheels, the only exterior details setting the 8·32 apart from other Themas were yellow &quot;8·32&quot; badges, a silver eggcrate-type grille, and twin exhaust outlets. Some notable options were automatic climate control, electrically actuated sunroof, provision for a car phone in the front armrest, and rear individual power seats.

In 1988, the 8·32 received series 2 updates like other Thema models, including new lights front and rear, a smaller grille badge, removal of model badging at the rear and on the side skirts, and the new side rubbing strips (previously absent on this model). The 8·32 did not received the facelift treatment of the third series of the Thema. This version of the Thema was produced in limited numbers, with 2,370 Series 1 cars built between 1986 and 1988 and 1,601 Series 2 carss built between 1989 and 1992. All were left-hand drive, although one Thema 8·32 was converted to right hand drive by TAK Motor Co. in South Africa in 1987 for the Managing Director of TAK.

The Thema 8·32&#x27;s key competitors were some of the fastest saloon models of the late 1980s including the Audi 100 Quattro, BMW M535i, Ford Sierra RS Cosworth, Saab 9000 2.3 Turbo S, and the Vauxhall Lotus Carlton/Opel Lotus Omega. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; described the 8·32 as &quot;one of the weirder sleepers to come out of the 1980s&quot;.

Towards the end of his life, Enzo Ferrari owned an 8·32 as his personal transport.

====Thema Limousine====
Built only on request for wealthy customers and Fiat Group executives, the Lancia Thema Limousine featured the same interior as the LX and the 8·32 versions. Most of them were powered by a 2.8 L &quot;PRV&quot; V6 engine, replaced in the last ones by the 3.0 L Alfa Romeo V6 engine. Only 24 Thema Limousines were built. The wheelbase of the car was extended by to , with a resulting overall length of . The weight increased to , or by just over one fifth. The price, meanwhile, was up nearly sixty percent over a comparably equipped regular wheelbase Thema V6.
===Engines===
With the exception of the 8·32 Ferrari engine, Thema powerplants originated from the Fiat engine series designed by Aurelio Lampredi, the famed engine designer formerly of Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. The straight-4 2.0 L petrol engine, available in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions, was refined and offered good performance. Earlier Themas were also offered with a 2.8 L &quot;PRV&quot; V6 engine, developed in cooperation with Peugeot, Renault, and Volvo. This unit was replaced in 1992 with a 3.0 L Alfa Romeo V6 engine (Fiat had bought Alfa Romeo in 1986 and gained access to this engine).

== Second generation (2011–2014) ==

Chrysler marketed the 300C for model years 2011–2014 as the Lancia Thema in Europe&#x27;s left hand drive markets. Right-hand drive markets (the United Kingdom and Ireland) kept the Chrysler 300C badging.

<text>The bee hummingbird, zunzuncito or Helena hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae) is a species of hummingbird, native to the island of Cuba in the Caribbean. It is the smallest known bird. The bee hummingbird feeds on nectar of flowers and bugs found in Cuba.

== Description ==
The bee hummingbird is the smallest living bird. Females weigh and are long, and are slightly larger than males, which have an average weight of and length of . Like all hummingbirds, it is a swift, strong flier.

The male has a green and bright red throat, iridescent gorget with elongated lateral plumes, bluish upper parts, and the rest of the underparts mostly greyish white. Compared to other small hummingbirds, which often have a slender appearance, the bee hummingbird looks rounded and plump.

Female bee hummingbirds are bluish green with a pale gray underside. The tips of their tail feathers have white spots. During the mating season, males have a reddish to pink head, chin, and throat. The female lays only two eggs at a time, each about the size of a coffee bean.

The bee hummingbird&#x27;s feathers have iridescent colors, which is not always noticeable, but depends on the viewing angle. The bird&#x27;s slender, pointed bill is adapted for probing deep into flowers. The bee hummingbird feeds mainly on nectar, by moving its tongue rapidly in and out of its mouth. In the process of feeding, the bird picks up pollen on its bill and head. When it flies from flower to flower, it transfers the pollen. In this way, it plays an important role in plant reproduction. In one day, the bee hummingbird may visit 1,500 flowers. It is a diurnal bird that can fly at , and it beats its wings 80–200 times per second, which allows it to remain stationary in the air to feed on flowers. The bee hummingbird lives up to seven years in the wild, and 10 years in captivity.

The bee hummingbird has also been described as . This characterization is based upon the recognition that birds are, in fact, a living form of theropod dinosaurs (or, strictly speaking, avian dinosaurs), and no smaller bird or non-avian dinosaur has been found in the fossil record.

The call is described as . Within their territory a male will often sing atop the highest tree.

== Diet ==

The bee hummingbird has been reported to visit ten plant species, nine of them native to Cuba.

They occasionally eat insects and spiders. In a typical day, bee hummingbirds will consume up to half their body weight in food.

== Taxonomy ==
The closest evolutionary relative of the bee hummingbird is the vervain hummingbird (&quot;Mellisuga minima)&quot;, the only other member of its genus. The habitats of the vervain hummingbird are in Cuba&#x27;s neighboring islands, Hispaniola and Jamaica.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The bee hummingbird is endemic to the entire Cuban archipelago, including the main island of Cuba and the Isla de la Juventud in the West Indies. In these regions bee hummingbirds generally live in areas of thick growth that contain lianas and epiphytes. Its population is fragmented; it is found in Cuba&#x27;s mogote areas in Pinar del Río Province and more commonly in Zapata Swamp (Matanzas Province) and in eastern Cuba, with reference localities in Alexander Humboldt National Park and Baitiquirí Ecological Reserve (Guantánamo Province) and Gibara and Sierra Cristal (Holguín Province).

== Breeding ==

Bee hummingbirds reach sexual maturity at one year of age. Male bee hummingbirds court females with sound from tail-feathers, which flutter during display dives. The bee hummingbird&#x27;s breeding season is March–June, with the female laying one or two eggs.

Using strands of cobwebs, bark, and lichen, female bee hummingbirds build a cup-shaped nest about in diameter and off the ground. The nest is lined with a layer of soft plant wool. Branches in mature, leafy jucaro (&quot;Terminalia buceras&quot;) and juvenile ocuje (&quot;Calophyllum antillanum&quot;) trees are commonly used for nest building. After completion of the nest, the eggs are incubated for 21 days by only the female, followed by 2 days of hatching, and 18 days of care by the mother. During days of care the mother will hunt for small insects while chicks are left alone in the nest. Over the final 4–5 days of care, juvenile bee hummingbirds practice their flight capabilities. The nests are used only once.

== Coevolution with flowers ==
The bee hummingbird&#x27;s interaction with the flowers that supply nectar is a notable example of bird–plant coevolution with its primary food source (flowers for nectar). Flowers that bee hummingbirds often feed from are odorless, have long narrow tubular corolla that are brightly colored, and has dilute nectar.

==Early life==

Tilly was born Jennifer Ellen Chan on September 16, 1958, in Harbor City, Los Angeles, to Harry Chan, a used car salesman, and Patricia (née Tilly), a Canadian schoolteacher and former stage actress. Her father was of Chinese descent and her mother was of Irish and Finnish ancestry. She has an older brother, Steve, and two younger sisters, Meg and Rebecca.

Following her parents&#x27; divorce when she was five, Tilly was raised by her mother and stepfather, John Ward, on rural Texada Island in British Columbia. According to her sister Meg, Ward was a sadistic pedophile.
Their sister Rebecca agreed, but Jennifer did not comment on the issue.
Her mother divorced again when Tilly was 16. The family then moved to Langford, a suburb of Victoria, British Columbia, where Tilly attended Belmont Secondary School.

During her high school years, she developed an interest in theater, which prompted her to actively participate in plays as an extra with the assistance of her mother. Tilly holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater from Stephens College in Missouri.

==Acting career==
In 1983, Tilly had small roles and had a recurring guest role on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; as Gina Srignoli, a mobster&#x27;s widow who becomes romantically involved with detective Henry Goldblume. She played Frasier Crane&#x27;s seductive-but-ditzy date Candi Pearson on an episode of the fourth season of &quot;Cheers&quot; and appeared as a similar character on the eleventh season of &quot;Frasier&quot;.

She appeared as Garry&#x27;s girlfriend on &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;, which aired on Showtime. She was also cast as a high-end prostitute on the short-lived comedy &quot;Key West&quot;, alongside Fisher Stevens. In 1989, she had a prominent role in the comedy &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, starring Richard Dreyfuss. Tilly&#x27;s breakthrough film role was short but memorable appearance as a waitress who fails miserably when auditioning to be a singer in &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;, a role that was written specially for her by Steve Kloves. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Olive Neal, a hopelessly bad actress in Woody Allen&#x27;s 1994 comedy &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; but she lost to her co-star Dianne Wiest. In 1994, she also had a small role in &quot;The Getaway&quot; with Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tilly starred in &quot;Bound&quot; (1996), directed by the Wachowskis, which portrays a lesbian relationship her character has with Gina Gershon. She played Samantha Cole in the Jim Carrey comedy &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (1997). In &quot;Dancing at the Blue Iguana&quot; (2000), she played a stripper and part-time dominatrix. She portrayed gossip columnist Louella Parsons in the Peter Bogdanovich historical drama &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot; (2001).

She gained additional popularity around that time for her portrayal of serial killer Tiffany Valentine in several of the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; horror movie series. The character was first introduced in the fourth installment of the franchise, &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; (1998), and subsequently appeared in &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot; (2004), &quot;Curse of Chucky&quot; (2013), &quot;Cult of Chucky&quot; (2017), and the television series &quot;Chucky&quot; (2021). In &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot;, she plays a dual role, providing the voice for Tiffany and also playing an exaggerated version of herself. The performance earned her nominations for the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Actress and the MTV Movie Award for Best Scared-As-Shit Performance. She reprises the role in every subsequent appearance.

In 2001, she starred as Crystal Allen in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Women&quot;. In 2002 she played Fanny Minafer in the made-for-TV remake of Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;.

She is a semi-regular cast member on &quot;Family Guy&quot;, voicing the Griffin family&#x27;s neighbor, Bonnie Swanson. She has also done voice-over work for the films &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Stuart Little&quot; and &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, as well as the children&#x27;s series &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; In Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot;, she portrays Madame Leota (a head in a crystal ball). She has been active in the theatre, winning a Theater World Award for her performance in the off-Broadway play &quot;One Shoe Off&quot;.

She had a starring role on the sitcom &quot;Out of Practice&quot;, which starred Henry Winkler and Stockard Channing. The series was cancelled in May 2006.

In 2009, Tilly made her Chinese film debut in the Christina Yao film &quot;Empire of Silver&quot; playing Mrs. Landdeck.

In 2012, she returned to Broadway in &quot;Don&#x27;t Dress for Dinner&quot;, garnering an Audience Choice Award nomination for her portrayal of mistress Suzanne. In 2013, she starred in the Wallace Shawn/Andre Gregory collaboration &quot;Grasses of a Thousand Colors&quot; which premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 2009 and then moved to the Joseph Papp Theater in 2013. She regularly appeared in the comedy revue &quot;Celebrity Autobiography&quot;.

In 2024, it was announced that Tilly would be appearing on &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot;, as a friend of the housewives, for the fourteenth season.

== Poker career ==

Tilly&#x27;s father was a gambler and a poker player, and gave her the video game &quot;World Series of Poker&quot;. She was subsequently taught the real game by her boyfriend when she moved to Hollywood.

On June 27, 2005, Tilly won a World Series of Poker bracelet (and $158,625) in the Ladies&#x27; No-Limit Texas hold &#x27;em event, beating 600 other players. She followed up this accomplishment on September 1, 2005, by winning the third World Poker Tour Ladies Invitational Tournament held at the Bicycle Casino in Bell Gardens, a suburb of Los Angeles. Tilly has appeared in the GSN Poker Royale series. Tilly played in the Celebrity Poker Showdown which aired June 14, 2006, on Bravo. She came in third place after being beaten by Bravo&#x27;s online poker champion Ida Siconolfi. She also participated in the &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; show.

When playing poker on television, Tilly often wears low-cut tops with push-up bras that expose considerable cleavage in order to &quot;look cute&quot;, but noted that &quot;if people are &quot;really&quot; playing poker, they don&#x27;t care. Nothing looks better to them than a pair of aces. They&#x27;re not looking at &quot;your&quot; pair. They&#x27;re looking at &quot;their&quot; pair.&quot; Tilly appears in the &quot;World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions 2007 Edition&quot; video game, along with her boyfriend Phil Laak, which was released in 2007 by Activision.

In a television interview in 2005, Tilly stated that at that point in her career she was more interested in pursuing poker than acting. By December 2008, Tilly announced her retirement from poker as a career. In her monthly column in &quot;Bluff Magazine&quot;, she said: &quot;I love poker but greatness in poker is an elusive dream. There are too many variants. Trying to find validation in poker is like trying to find a virgin in a whorehouse. I&#x27;m not giving up poker entirely – gambling is an addiction after all. I&#x27;m just going to treat it more like a hobby and less like a career.&quot;

In January 2010, she resumed her poker career. She was nominated for PokerListings&#x27; Spirit of Poker Living Legend Award in 2014, and , her live tournament winnings exceeded $1 million.

==Personal life==
Tilly was married to Sam Simon, developer and producer of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, from 1984 until 1991. As of 2018, Tilly receives 30 percent of net proceeds that Simon&#x27;s estate receives from the show, an arrangement she credits with allowing her to be choosier about her roles. She has been in a relationship with professional poker player Phil Laak since 2004.

<doc id="863976" wikidata="Q1252265" url="?curid=863976" title="Liberals of Serbia">
<text>The Liberals of Serbia (; abbr. ЛС, LS) was a political party in Serbia.

==History==
The party was founded in 1990 when the Social Democratic Youth League reconstituted itself as Movement for Serbia – New Democracy. The party was renamed to just New Democracy in March 1993.

In the 1993 election, when the Socialist Party of Serbia lost its majority in parliament, New Democracy, which had previously belonged to the DEPOS, supported the socialists in gaining a parliamentary majority necessary to form a government, citing Milošević&#x27;s commitment to securing a peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1998, New Democracy left the government and was replaced by the Serbian Radical Party.

In 2000, New Democracy was a part of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition, the candidate of which, Vojislav Koštunica, won the 2000 presidential elections. At the parliamentary election in the same year, the party was part of the same coalition and participated in the government which was formed by DOS. In 2003 the party was renamed &quot;Liberals of Serbia&quot;.

At the parliamentary election on 28 December 2003 Liberals of Serbia put up as candidates the former Serbian Interior Minister Dušan Mihajlović and the former Chief of Serbian Police, General Sreten Lukić, the latter indicted for war crimes in the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The party won 0.7% of the popular vote and no seats.

In October 2005 Mihajlović stepped down and Radivoje Lazarević, former Yugoslav ambassador to Brazil, took over as party president.

In 2010, acting president of the party, Miroslav Stefanović, was fined 150.000 RSD for falsely accusing Vladimir Beba Popović of being responsible for the assassination of Zoran Đinđić in 2007.

The party ceased to exist in 2010.

<doc id="863978" wikidata="Q965247" url="?curid=863978" title="Toaripi Lauti">
<text>Sir Toaripi Lauti (28 November 1928 – 25 May 2014) was a Tuvaluan politician who served as chief minister of the Colony of Tuvalu (1975–78), as the first prime minister following Tuvalu&#x27;s independence (1978–1981) and governor-general of Tuvalu (1990–1993). He was married to Sualua Tui.

==Education==

Lauti was born in Toaripi village of the Territory of Papua. His father was Pastor Lauti Kae of Funafuti. He studied at Elisefou (New Ellice) primary school in Vaitupu for 6 years from 1938 to 1944. In 1945, he was sent to study in Fiji at the Londoni Provincial School, and in 1946 at the Queen Victoria School, before moving in 1947 to Wesley College in Auckland, New Zealand. From 1948 to 1951, he finished his schooling at St Andrews College in Christchurch in 1948. He attended the Teachers&#x27; Training College in Christchurch in 1952 and 1953, at the same time he was a House Master at St Andrew&#x27;s College.

==Pre-Independence career==

Toaripi Lauti was a teacher at King George V Secondary School in Tarawa from 1954 to 1962. From 1962 to 1974 he was an industrial relations officer with the British Phosphate Commissioners in Nauru. In 1974, he entered politics and became a member of the House of Assembly for the constituency of Funafuti of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, as leader of the Opposition.

He was the first chief minister of the Colony of Tuvalu, the former Ellice Islands, from 2 October 1975 to 1 October 1978.

==Prime Minister of Tuvalu, post-independence==

When Tuvalu became independent in 1978, he was appointed as its first prime minister. He was also the minister of finance from 1977 to 1981. He was appointed as a member of the Privy Council in 1979.

The first elections after independence were not held until 8 September 1981. At that election, Tomasi Puapua was elected as prime minister with a 7:5 majority over the group of members of parliament headed by Lauti. The administration of Toaripi Lauti had become involved in controversy, as a result of his decision to invest nearly all of the government&#x27;s money with an American real estate salesman who promised 15 percent returns from the purchase of land in Texas. The investment turned out to be a fraud. While the funds were recovered by US agencies, the controversy resulted in a loss of confidence in his judgment and was an important factor in the election of Puapua.

Lauti also served as the President of the Funafuti Town Council and as a member of the Tuvalu Language Board.

==Governor-General of Tuvalu==

His reputation was redeemed from the circumstances that ended his time as prime minister, he was the Governor-General of Tuvalu, representing Elizabeth II, Queen of Tuvalu as head of state, from 1 October 1990 through 1 December 1993. In 1990, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

Its distinct features are two handles counter-rotating around the tang such that, when closed, the blade is concealed within grooves in the handles. A latch sometimes holds the handles together; typically mounted on the one facing the cutting edge (the &quot;bite handle&quot;). An exceptionally large balisong is called a balisword.

The balisong was commonly used by Filipinos, especially those in the Tagalog region, as self-defense and a pocket utility knife. Hollow-grind balisongs were also used as straight razors before conventional razors were made available in the Philippines. In the hands of a trained user, the knife blade can be brought out to bear quickly using one hand. Manipulations, called &quot;flipping&quot;, are performed for art or amusement. Blunt &quot;trainer&quot; versions of these knives are also available and can be used to practice tricks without the risk of injury.

The knife is now illegal or restricted in some countries, often under the same laws and for the same reasons that switchblades or concealed weapons are restricted. Within the Philippines, it is no longer as common in urban areas as in the past.

==Name==
Names for the knives in English include &quot;fan knives&quot; and &quot;butterfly knives&quot; from the motion, and &quot;click clacks&quot; from the sound they make when they are opened and closed.

The name &quot;balisong&quot; is derived from barangay (village) Balisong, part of the municipality of Taal, Batangas province, which along with the neighboring barangay Pandayan (now part of Poblacion zones 6, 9, and 10 of Taal town proper), were the original manufacturing centers of the knives in the Philippines. The two barangays were home to a blacksmith industry that also produced other bladed implements such as bolo knives. It is also claimed that the meaning of the term &quot;balisong&quot; is derived from the Tagalog words &quot;baling sungay&quot; (literally, &quot;broken/folding horn&quot;) as the hilt of the blade was traditionally made from carved carabao and deer horn, as well as bones. The traditional balisong is also known as &quot;veinte y nueve&quot; or &quot;twenty-nine&quot; in the Philippines because they are long when opened.

==History==
The origin of the knives is unclear. Oral histories claim that the knives were first created in the Philippines in 800 CE. However, there is no documentation or archeological evidence to back this. Balisong&#x27;s mass production in the Philippines can only be attested to the early 1900s. Another claim is that balisong was originally an adaptation of a French measuring tool called the &quot;pied du roi&quot; (&quot;foot of the king&quot;), invented between the 1500s to the late 1760s. However, how it was introduced to the Philippines is unknown. There are theories that it may have been introduced by sailors in the Spanish Empire, which was then allied with France.

Regardless of origin, the modern balisong was perfected in the Philippines, where it became much larger, and was predominantly used as a weapon, not just a tool. The quick opening techniques (&quot;flipping&quot;) were also developed in the Philippines. In contrast, the French &quot;pied du roi&quot; was primarily a folding ruler, with the knife only included in some specimens as a novelty. They were cumbersome to open and unlikely to be used for self-defense, especially since they also commonly included a metal tang at a right angle from the end of the handle to aid in measuring. There were also very similar designs to the balisong produced in England in the late 19th century, presumably also derived from the &quot;pied du roi&quot;. But like the latter, they were primarily utilitarian tools.

==Construction==
There are two main types of balisong construction: &quot;sandwich construction&quot; and &quot;channel construction&quot;.

Sandwich-constructed balisong knives are assembled in layers that are generally pinned or screwed together. They allow the pivot pins to be adjusted more tightly without binding. When the knife is closed, the blade rests between the layers.

For a channel-constructed balisong, the main part of each handle is formed from one piece of material. In this handle, a groove is created (either by folding, milling, or being integrally cast) in which the blade rests when the knife is closed. This style is regarded as being stronger than sandwich construction.

Additionally, the two constructions can be combined to form the &quot;chanwich construction&quot;, which involves two halves of a channel handle screwed together. Although rare, this construction generally keeps the best elements of both constructions and discards the worst, as it retains the better handle shape channel construction is known for, while still allowing adjustment of the tightness the handles are held together with to some extent, as well as easier access to the inside of the handle for cleaning. One notable example is the Tsunami from Squid Industries.

There are also three methods of operation balisongs use: bearings, bushings, or only washers.

Bearing-operated balisongs have small ball bearings housed in a circular concavity around the hole in the pivot. These bearings allow the handles of the balisong to rotate.

Bushing-operated balisongs have a small metal bushing slightly thicker than the tang in each pivot hole with a usually bronze disc known as a washer on each side. These washers clamp down on the bushing, but not on the tang, when the pivot screw is tightened, allowing the handle to rotate around the tang.

There are also washer-only operated balisongs which are usually much cheaper and lower quality than the other kinds, as they don&#x27;t need bushings, but the handles will always bind to the tang when the screws are tightened enough and the washers, tang and handles all wear themselves down much faster due to the increased friction.

Some of the blades of traditional butterfly knives in the Philippines were made from steel taken from railroad tracks, thus giving them a decent amount of durability and toughness, while others are made from recycled leaf springs of vehicles.

Most modern balisongs, such as the Benchmade 51, do not use tang pins. Instead, they use &quot;zen pins&quot;, which are two small pins embedded in the top of the handles of the balisong which make contact with the bottom of the blade. While a balisong with zen pins is easier for end user to perform maintenance on for the end user and significantly easier to design; they do not hold up as long as tang pins would in a properly made knife. the force of the harder blade contacting the soft zen pins will mean they need replaced far more often than tang pins which should be mild steel so the blade doesn&#x27;t crack and can cushion against soft handle materials rather than crush each other.

Some modern balisongs also have a &quot;pinless&quot; system, in which they do not have any pins, and instead rely on the material of the handles to make contact with the blade, similar to how zen pins work. One notable example of a pinless balisong is the Squid Industries Swordfish. The longevity of pinless is exceedingly short and not meant for long term usage before the system itself fails and the knife breaks. An example of this is the Monarch from JK Design where the handles would contact each other after as short of time as 2 months of usage. 

==Parts==
; Bite handle: The handle that closes on the sharp edge of the blade, and will cut the user if they are holding that handle when the knife closes. This handle usually carries the latch.
; Choil: The unsharpened portion of the blade just above the kicker, that makes it easier to sharpen the blade.
; Kicker (or Kick): Area on the blade that prevents the sharp edge from touching the inside of the handle and suffering damage. This is sometimes supplanted by an additional tang pin above the pivots.
; Latch: The standard locking system, which holds the knife closed. Magnets are occasionally used instead.
; Latch, Batangas: A latch that is attached to the bite handle.
; Latch, Manila: A latch that is attached to the safe handle.
; Latch, Spring: A latch that utilizes a spring to propel the latch open when the handles are squeezed.
; Latch gate : A block inside the channel of the handles stopping the latch from impacting the blade.
; Pivot joint: A pin about which the Tang/Blade/Handle assemblies pivot.
; Safe handle: The handle (generally the handle without the latch) that closes on the non-sharpened edge of the blade. 
; Swedge: Unsharpened spine of the blade. Some balisongs are also sharpened here or on both sides with either a more traditional look or wavy edges similar to a Kris sword.
; Tang: The base of the blade where the handles are attached with pivot pins.
; Tang Pin(s): Pin meant to hold the blade away from the handle when closed to prevent dulling; and, in some cases, a second pin to keep the handles from excessively banging together while the butterfly knife is being manipulated.
; Zen Pins: Screws mounted inside the handles that collide with the kicker mounted on the tang to prevent the blade from moving around while in the open or closed position.
; Blade: The blade is a piece of steel that runs down the center of the knife that is secured by both handles when closed. One edge of the blade is sharp and will cut the user if they are not careful, especially when flipping the knife. The other side is called the spine and can have what is known as a swedge. The swedge is a blunt bevel ground in for looks and won&#x27;t cut the user. The spine commonly impacts the user&#x27;s hand when flipping.
; Bushing: A small barrel of steel included in the blade so the handles can be tightened without back and forth movement. the bushing is a highly precise element of modern balisong knives and require specialized tuning to function properly.

==Legal status==

The balisong has been outlawed in several countries, mainly due to its easy utility in crimes and its ability to be easily concealed for the same purpose. In some jurisdictions, its criminal use is considered a knife crime.
* In Australia, balisongs are generally classified as a prohibited weapon, which requires a special, legitimate excuse to possess it. Australia defines balisongs as a flick knife (or other similar device) that has a blade which opens automatically by gravity or centrifugal acceleration or by any pressure applied to a button, spring or device in or attached to the handle of the knife.
* In Belgium, butterfly knives are illegal.
* In Canada, although not specified by name as a prohibited weapon, the balisong knife is often considered by courts to fall under the gravity knife or centrifugal classification and is therefore prohibited, unless grandfathered in before prohibition.
* In the Czech Republic, balisongs, switchblades, and gravity knives are treated like normal knives.
* In Denmark, butterfly knives are illegal.
* In Finland, balisongs are legal to be purchased, sold and possessed, and are treated just like regular knives and befall under the edged weapons law. Carrying one in public is permitted if the person carrying one can prove it is used as a tool.
* In France, balisongs are legal to own if one is over 18 years of age but are illegal to carry without official authorization.
* In Germany, the balisong was outlawed when the Waffengesetz (weapons law) was tightened in April 2003 in the aftermath of the Erfurt massacre. Thus, buying, possessing, lending, using, carrying, crafting, altering and trading it is illegal and is punishable by up to five years imprisonment, confiscation of the knife and a fine of up to €10,000. Using a butterfly knife for a crime of any kind – as is any illegal weapon – is punishable by from 1 to 10 years imprisonment.
* In Hungary, balisongs, switchblades and gravity knives are treated like normal knives. They are legal to possess one regardless of its length, but it is illegal to carry one that is longer than in public.
*In Ireland, butterfly knives are illegal offensive weapons.
* In Italy, balisongs are legal to own if not sharpened on both sides, but illegal to carry without justifiable reason.
* In Lithuania, balisongs among other knives are legal to possess and carry as they are not considered weapons. This excludes switchblades.
* In the Netherlands, balisongs are illegal.
* In New Zealand, balisongs are illegal.
* In Norway, balisongs are illegal.
* In the Philippines, it is now generally illegal to carry one without identification or a proper permit in the streets of the capital because of their prevalent use in crime and altercations. One now needs to demonstrate the need for professional livelihood or utilitarian purpose (such as cutting grass, preparing fruit and meat, being a vendor of knives, being martial arts instructors, etc.) to be able to walk around with bladed implements in the urban areas. Another rule of thumb is that the blade of pocketknives must not exceed the length of the palm and must not be openable by one hand to be considered as a utility knife, as opposed to a weapon (thus, Swiss Army Knives, are legal).
* In Poland, balisongs, switchblades and gravity knives are treated like normal knives.
* In Russia, balisongs are legal only if the length of the blade is not more than .
* In Sweden, it&#x27;s illegal to carry, import or trade a balisong, but legal to own and collect.
* In Switzerland, balisongs are illegal to carry, give, lend, buy, or trade.
* In the United Kingdom, the balisong has been legally classified as an offensive weapon since January 1989. Carrying one in public is an offence under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. Sale, lending, hiring, giving or importing is prohibited by the Criminal Justice Act 1988, as amended by the Offensive Weapons Act 1996. Any imported are liable to be seized and prosecution may follow. An exception is made for knives of this type over 100 years old, which are classed as antiques.
* In some parts of the United States, it is illegal to possess or carry such a knife in public. In certain jurisdictions, balisongs are categorized as gravity knives, switchblades, or daggers.
** In California, balisong/switchblade knives are legal to own, buy, sell, and transport if the length of the blade is not more than . If the length of the blade is more than they are illegal to buy, sell, transfer, or possess in public although it is legal to possess one if kept at home (Penal Code section 17235 &amp; 21510).
** In Florida, butterfly knives are legal, as Florida defines butterfly knives as a type of folding knife. However, butterfly knives are subject to the same concealed carry licensing requirements as all other folding knives with blades longer than four inches.
** In Hawaii, it was illegal to possess, manufacture, sell, transfer, or transport any balisong/butterfly-type knife until the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the ban in August 2023.
** In Kansas, there were once legal restrictions on butterfly knives; however, , the Kansas Comprehensive Knife Rights Act decriminalized the carrying of all types of bladed weapons.
**In Illinois, it is legal to own and carry a butterfly knife. 
***In Chicago, it is illegal to carry a concealed knife with a blade longer than . Automatic (switchblade) knives and gravity knives are prohibited, as carrying a concealed double-edged knife.
**In Indiana, it is legal to own and carry a butterfly knife both concealed and open.
** In Kentucky, the balisong is legal for concealed and open carrying anywhere one is not otherwise prohibited from carrying a concealed deadly weapon. Kentucky&#x27;s constitution and revised statutes prohibit cities and counties from enacting weapons laws and restrictions.
** In Maine, it is legal to own, sell, and carry.
** In Massachusetts, the balisong is legal for concealed and open carrying so long as it does not &quot;[present] an objective threat of danger to a person of reasonable and average sensibility.&quot; Restrictions also apply depending on the area of the person carrying the knife (such as within a public school).
** In Michigan, the balisong is legal because it is classified as a folding knife.
** In New Jersey, balisongs are illegal (NJSA 2C:39-1), but the question of legality or illegality is open.
** In New Mexico, possession of a butterfly knife is illegal, because the butterfly knife is a switchblade within the meaning of the statute making possession of switchblades unlawful.
** In New York, the balisong has been determined not to be a gravity knife, and therefore not prohibited under the Penal Law [see: People v. Zuniga, 303 A.D.2d 773 (2nd Dept. 2003)] However, the law prohibiting gravity knives was found to be unconstitutional and their possession was decriminalized in 2019.
** In North Carolina, citizens are allowed to carry most pocketknives most of the time. Statute S.14-269, which prohibits the concealed carrying of any &quot;bowie knife, dirk, dagger&quot;, or &quot;other deadly weapon of like kind&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply to an &quot;ordinary pocketknife carried in a closed position&quot;.
** In North Dakota, it is legal to own a balisong and carry it openly. However, they are illegal to carry concealed, as they are considered to be deadly weapons.
** In Ohio, it is legal to own a balisong and carry it openly, and illegal to carry concealed, as it is considered a deadly weapon.
** In Oklahoma, the balisong is legal for open carry but is illegal to carry concealed.
** In Oregon, it is illegal to carry a concealed balisong.
** In Tennessee, there are no restrictions in carrying a balisong and similar knives, whether open or concealed carrying. Restrictions on these instead focuses on intent rather than merely carrying.
** In Texas, switchblades are legal .
** In Utah, balisongs are legal to own and carry as long as you are not a &quot;Restricted Person&quot; as described in Utah State Code §76-10-503.
** In Virginia, the balisong is legal for concealed, and open, carrying according to state law.
** In Washington, the balisong is classified as a spring blade knife, and under state law, one cannot manufacture, sell, dispose of, or possess such knives.

Balisong trainers feature a special blunt and unsharpened &quot;blade&quot; and are legal in some areas where balisongs are not.

<text>Martin Redmond (15 August 1937 – 20 January 1997) was a British Labour Party politician from Doncaster in South Yorkshire.

Martin Redmond was of Irish descent and was born in Scawsby, near Doncaster. He was educated at Woodlands Roman Catholic School and then by day release at the University of Sheffield. He worked as a driver of heavy goods vehicles, and was elected to Doncaster Borough Council in 1975. He became leader of the council in 1982, and was elected at the 1983 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Don Valley, sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons in a debate on housing on 5 July 1983, and spoke frequently in the Commons on the miners strike.
He was a leading member of the All-Party Parliamentary Groups for interest in Thailand, Bahrain, Malta and ASEAN.

He was re-elected in 1987 and 1992, but died in office in January 1997 from cancer. No by-election was held, and his seat remained vacant when Parliament was dissolved in April for the general election in May 1997. The seat was won by Caroline Flint of the Labour Party.

<text>The Battle of Delhi or Battle of Patparganj took place on 11 September 1803 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, between British East India Company troops of the Bombay Army under General Lake, and the Marathas of Scindia&#x27;s army under General Louis Bourquin and Sardar Ravsaheb Wable.

==Events==
Bourquin had treacherously deserted his former friend General Perron and now commanded 1743 battalions of the latter&#x27;s troops. The battle was fought at Mosadabad, right across the Yamuna River from Humayun&#x27;s Tomb, also giving the battle its local name.

The Marathas initially occupied a strong position with the Yamuna River in their rear. But, General Gerard Lake, feigning a retreat, drew them from their lines and then turning upon them drove them with the bayonet into the river, inflicting more losses upon them. Finally, the city of Delhi fell three days later. As a result, the control of the city of Delhi passed from the Marathas to the British.

A monument was later erected at the site in Patparganj, marked out by a surrounding ditch, commemorating Cornet Sanguine and the Company army soldiers who fell during the battle.

<text>Ensoniq ESQ-1 is a 61-key, velocity sensitive, eight-note polyphonic and multitimbral synthesizer released by Ensoniq in 1985. It was marketed as a &quot;digital wave synthesizer&quot; but was an early Music Workstation. Although its voice generation is typically subtractive in much the same fashion as most analog synthesizers that preceded it, its oscillators are neither voltage nor &quot;digitally controlled&quot;, but true digital oscillators, provided by a custom Ensoniq wavetable chip. The signal path includes analog resonant low-pass filters and an analog amplifier.

The synth also features a fully functional, 8-track MIDI sequencer that can run either its internal sounds, external MIDI equipment, or both, with a capacity of 2, 400 notes (expandable via cartridges). It provides quantization, step-editing, primitive forms of copy/paste editing, and can be synchronized with external MIDI or tape-in clock.

The ESQ-1 had a particularly easy user interface, especially for a feature-filled digital synthesizer of the time and a multitimbral workstation/sequencer , by way of a then-large 40-character x 2-line display, ten softkeys (5 above and 5 below display), and system of all dedicated direct-access buttons per ten-parameter/patch page, meaning there was no &quot;menu diving&quot; within hierarchical series of sub-pages whatsoever. 

ESQ-1 can store 40 rewritable sound patches internally, and features a rewritable EEPROM or fixed ROM cartridge slot for access to 80 additional patches. ESQ-M, a rackmount version of the synthesizer, was released circa 1987, with the same specifications but without the sequencer and a significantly smaller display and less user-friendly interface.

Notably, the sound chip at the core of the synth, the 5503 Digital Oscillator Chip (DOC), is a brainchild of Robert Yannes, father of the popular Commodore SID chip.The chip was previously used in Ensoniq&#x27;s Mirage sampler, later in ESQ-1&#x27;s enhanced successor SQ-80, as well as the Apple IIGS personal computer.

==Voicing==

The ESQ-1 features eight voices with three oscillators per voice, and is fully multi-timbral. Despite eight voice polyphony, it is capable of tracking nine voices - when using eight internal sounds in the sequencer, one additional internal or cartridge sound can be controlled independently. The wave ROM contains 32 different waveforms, including standard synthesis waveforms such as sawtooth and square, but also less usual ones such as &quot;piano&quot;, &quot;voice&quot;, or &quot;bass&quot; (note that, although multi-sampled, these are still single-cycle waveforms, not true samples as such).

Each oscillator can be independently volume-controlled via its dedicated &quot;digitally-controlled&quot; amplifier, and modulated. Oscillator amplifiers provide room to be &quot;overdriven&quot;, and thus produce moderate analog distortion as an additional effect on, for example, synth leads or organ sounds.

ESQ-1 has three independent LFOs, and three independent envelope generators which can be programmed to modulate any number of parameters. The fourth envelope generator is hardwired to the main output amplifier though it can still be used as a modulation source for other parameters as well. The output amplifier (DCA4) also provides programmable panning for each voice. 
Its envelope generators allow numerical level/rate settings, and like many other synthesis parameters, allow the use of negative values. Furthermore, they can be set to track for keyboard velocity and alter the attack segment of the envelope (enabling a voice to have a soft attack when played softly or vice versa), and note position to alter envelope length (for instance, on a piano sound, having shorter notes higher up the keyboard).

Its low-pass filters are analog (CEM 3379), but digitally controlled, and thus can be modulated with a significant number of sources, including LFO, envelopes, velocity, aftertouch, modulation wheel, etc. Even though the filter resonance can be driven to extreme effect, the resonance setting features only 32 steps, and the filters do not fully self-oscillate. The ESQ-1&#x27;s keybed doesn&#x27;t feature aftertouch, but the synthesis engine is capable of processing polyphonic aftertouch over MIDI, such as the polyphonic aftertouch implementation of the SQ-80&#x27;s keyboard.

Furthermore, Ensoniq ESQ-1 features amplitude modulation, oscillator sync, monophonic mode, and portamento.

==Voice programming==

Each section of the synthesizer is called to screen via a dedicated button, and settings inside each category are made by using one data slider or two +/- buttons. Settings do not influence the sound directly, but rather, changes are heard only when the next note is played. In other words, one can&#x27;t use the data slider to change the filter cutoff setting as a way of producing a &quot;filter sweep&quot;, but can use any of the modulation sources to the same effect (including envelopes, the modulation wheel, modulation pedal, or external controllers over MIDI). Any modulation source can be set up to modulate any page of any given program (such as OSC1, DCA1, Filter, etc.). Voices are organized in four banks, and all presets can be overwritten by the user, and exported as banks via the tape-out port in the form of audio-encoded data, thus making it easy to store any number of user-created banks on tape or, for example, a computer. Additionally, it has a cartridge slot for voice cartridges. Commercial cartridges come with two sets of four banks of voices each, but there are also blank or rewritable cartridges.

==Sequencing==

ESQ-1 has an eight track sequencer, which can be set to use any of the internal or cartridge sounds, or alternatively set to MIDI output channel for any track separately, while still being able to control a local voice on that track as well. Mixer section provides volume control for local sounds. MIDI output sends program changes, and the sequencer records continuous controller data such as pitch and modulation wheel use. The sequencer capacity can be expanded with additional cartridges. Events can be recorded in real-time (playing the keyboard or using any of the controllers with the optional use of integrated metronome with pre-count), or step by step. Recorded data can be quantized and tracks can be merged and copied. Changes and edits can be auditioned non-destructively. The sequencer can be set to slave or master clock, via MIDI or tape, and optionally controlled for play, record and punch-in via a footswitch. Sequences of up to 999 bars can be chained to &quot;songs&quot;, with programmable number of repetitions for each, or sequenced live, since a currently selected sequence will play only after the previous one ends. Each &quot;sequence&quot; can use a different tempo.

<text>The Battle of Farrukhabad (14 November 1804) was an engagement during the Second Anglo-Maratha War between forces of the British East India Company and the forces of Yashwantrao Holkar of the Maratha Confederacy.

==Battle==
The battle took place at Farrukhabad in what is now Uttar Pradesh, India. The Company&#x27;s forces, led by General Gerard Lake, surprised Holkar&#x27;s forces after making forced marches of more than in the preceding 24 hours.

Lake &quot;attacked the Maratha camp where the soldiers were still sleeping off the effects of the previous night&#x27;s revelry.&quot; Holkar himself very narrowly escaped capture in the attack. The battle ended in a Maratha victory and the British forces were routed.

<text>A line card or digital line card is a modular electronic circuit designed to fit on a separate printed circuit board (PCB) and interface with a telecommunications access network.

A line card typically interfaces with a twisted pair cable of a plain old telephone service (POTS) local loop to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Telephone line cards perform multiple tasks, such as analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion of voice, off-hook detection, ring supervision, line integrity tests, and other BORSCHT functions. In some telephone exchange designs, the line cards generate ringing current and decode DTMF signals. The line card in a subscriber loop carrier is called a subscriber line interface card (SLIC).

A line card can terminate a line supporting voice POTS service, ISDN service, DSL service, or proprietary ones. Some line cards are capable of terminating more than one type of service.

Since an access network element is usually intended to interface many users (typically a few thousand), some exchanges have multiple line terminations per card. Likewise, one network element can have many line cards.

<doc id="863995" wikidata="Q160218" url="?curid=863995" title="New Objectivity">
<text>The New Objectivity (in ) was a movement in German art that arose during the 1920s as a reaction against expressionism. The term was coined by Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub, the director of the &quot;Kunsthalle&quot; in Mannheim, who used it as the title of an art exhibition staged in 1925 to showcase artists who were working in a post-expressionist spirit. 
As these artists—who included Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Jeanne Mammen—rejected the self-involvement and romantic longings of the expressionists, Weimar intellectuals in general made a call to arms for public collaboration, engagement, and rejection of romantic idealism.

Although principally describing a tendency in German painting, the term took a life of its own and came to characterize the attitude of public life in Weimar Germany as well as the art, literature, music, and architecture created to adapt to it. Rather than some goal of philosophical objectivity, it was meant to imply a turn towards practical engagement with the world—an all-business attitude, understood by Germans as intrinsically American.

The movement essentially ended in 1933 with the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of the Nazi dictatorship.

Although &quot;New Objectivity&quot; has been the most common translation of &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot;, other translations have included &quot;New Matter-of-factness&quot;, &quot;New Resignation&quot;, &quot;New Sobriety&quot;, and &quot;New Dispassion&quot;. The art historian Dennis Crockett says there is no direct English translation, and breaks down the meaning in the original German:

In particular, Crockett argues against the view implied by the translation of &quot;New Resignation&quot;, which he says is a popular misunderstanding of the attitude it describes. The idea that it conveys resignation comes from the notion that the age of great socialist revolutions was over and that the left-leaning intellectuals who were living in Germany at the time wanted to adapt themselves to the social order represented in the Weimar Republic. Crockett says the art of the &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; was meant to be more forward in political action than the modes of Expressionism it was turning against: &quot;The &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; is Americanism, cult of the objective, the hard fact, the predilection for functional work, professional conscientiousness, and usefulness.&quot;

==Background==

Leading up to World War I, much of the art world was under the influence of Futurism and Expressionism, both of which abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition. Expressionism was in particular the dominant form of art in Germany, and it was represented in many different facets of public life—in dance, in theater, in painting, in architecture, in poetry, and in literature.

Expressionists abandoned nature and sought to express emotional experience, often centering their art around inner turmoil (angst), whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst and unease with bourgeois life, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled &quot;Menschheitsdämmerung&quot;, which translates to “Twilight of Humanity”—meant to suggest that humanity was in a twilight; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.

Critics of expressionism came from many circles. From the left, a strong critique began with Dadaism. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and seeing their common cause, wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest—they saw shaking off the constraints of artistic language in the same way they saw their refusal of national boundaries. They wanted to use their art in order to express political outrage and encourage political action. Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it.

Bertolt Brecht, a German dramatist, launched another early critique of expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just as in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a &quot;will to drama&quot;, but no real drama. His early plays, &quot;Baal&quot; and &quot;Trommeln in der Nacht&quot; (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism.

After the destruction of the war, more conservative critics gained force particularly in their critique of the style of expressionism. Throughout Europe a return to order in the arts resulted in neoclassical works by modernists such as Picasso and Stravinsky, and a turn away from abstraction by many artists, for example Matisse and Metzinger. The return to order was especially pervasive in Italy.

Because of travel restrictions, German artists in 1919–1922 had little knowledge of contemporary trends in French art; Henri Rousseau, who died in 1910, was the French painter whose influence was most apparent in the works of the New Objectivity. However, some of the Germans found important inspiration in the pages of the Italian magazine &quot;Valori plastici&quot;, which featured photographs of recent paintings by Italian classical realists.
==Painting==
===Verists and classicists===
Hartlaub first used the term in 1923 in a letter he sent to colleagues describing an exhibition he was planning. In his subsequent article, &quot;Introduction to &#x27;New Objectivity&#x27;: German Painting since Expressionism&quot;, Hartlaub explained, 
The New Objectivity was composed of two tendencies which Hartlaub characterized in terms of a left and right wing: on the left were the &quot;verists&quot;, who &quot;tear the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature&quot;; and on the right the &quot;classicists&quot;, who &quot;search more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere&quot;.

The verists&#x27; vehement form of realism emphasized the ugly and sordid. Their art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical. George Grosz and Otto Dix are considered the most important of the verists. The verists developed Dada&#x27;s abandonment of any pictorial rules or artistic language into a “satirical hyperrealism”, as termed by Raoul Hausmann, and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of John Heartfield. Use of collage in these works became a &quot;compositional&quot; principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things. Artists such as Grosz, Dix, Georg Scholz, and Rudolf Schlichter painted satirical scenes that often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon-like. When painting portraits, they gave emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted.

Other verists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad&#x27;s paintings are characterized by &quot;an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin&quot;, according to the art critic Wieland Schmied. Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality.

Max Beckmann, who is sometimes called an expressionist although he never considered himself part of any movement, was considered by Hartlaub to be a verist and the most important artist of &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot;.

Compared to the verists, the classicists more clearly exemplify the &quot;return to order&quot; that arose in the arts throughout Europe. The classicists included Georg Schrimpf, Alexander Kanoldt, Carlo Mense, Heinrich Maria Davringhausen, and Wilhelm Heise. The sources of their inspiration included 19th-century art, the Italian metaphysical painters, the artists of Novecento Italiano, and Henri Rousseau.

The classicists are best understood by Franz Roh&#x27;s term Magic Realism, though Roh originally intended &quot;magical realism&quot; to be synonymous with the &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; as a whole. For Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, the idea was to declare &quot;[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.&quot; With the term, he was emphasizing the &quot;magic&quot; of the normal world as it presents itself to us—how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic.

===Regional groups===

Most of the artists of the New Objectivity did not travel widely, and stylistic tendencies were related to geography. While the classicists were based mostly in Munich, the verists worked mainly in Berlin (Grosz, Dix, Schlichter, and Schad); Dresden (Dix, Hans Grundig, Wilhelm Lachnit and others); and Karlsruhe (Karl Hubbuch, Georg Scholz, and Wilhelm Schnarrenberger). The works of the Karlsruhe artists emphasize a hard, precise style of drawing, as in Hubbuch&#x27;s watercolor &quot;The Cologne Swimmer&quot; (1923).

In Cologne, a constructivist group led by Franz Wilhelm Seiwert and Heinrich Hoerle also included Gerd Arntz. Also from Cologne was Anton Räderscheidt, who after a brief constructivist phase became influenced by Antonio Donghi and the metaphysical artists.

Artists active in Hanover, such as Grethe Jürgens, Hans Mertens, Ernst Thoms, and Erich Wegner, depicted provincial subject matter with an often lyrical style.

Franz Radziwill, who painted ominous landscapes, lived in relative isolation in Dangast, a small coastal town. Carl Grossberg became a painter after studying architecture in Aachen and Darmstadt and is noted for his clinical rendering of industrial technology.

==Photography==
Albert Renger-Patzsch and August Sander are leading representatives of the &quot;New Photography&quot; movement, which brought a sharply focused, documentary quality to the photographic art where previously the self-consciously poetic had held sway. Some other related projects as &quot;Neues Sehen&quot;, coexisted at the same moment. Karl Blossfeldt&#x27;s botanical photography is also often described as being a variation on New Objectivity.

==Architecture==


New Objectivity in architecture, as in painting and literature, describes German work of the transitional years of the early 1920s in the Weimar culture, as a direct reaction to the stylistic excesses of Expressionist architecture and the change in the national mood. Architects such as Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn and Hans Poelzig turned to New Objectivity&#x27;s straightforward, functionally minded, matter-of-fact approach to construction, which became known in Germany as (&quot;New Building&quot;). The movement, flourishing in the brief period between the adoption of the Dawes plan and the rise of the Nazis, encompassed public exhibitions like the Weissenhof Estate, the massive urban planning and public housing projects of Taut and Ernst May, and the influential experiments at the Bauhaus.

==Film==

In film, New Objectivity reached its high point around 1929. As a cinematic style, it translated into realistic settings, straightforward camerawork and editing, a tendency to examine inanimate objects as a way to interpret characters and events, a lack of overt emotionalism, and social themes.

The director most associated with the movement is Georg Wilhelm Pabst. Pabst&#x27;s films of the 1920s concentrate on social issues such as abortion, prostitution, labor disputes, homosexuality, and addiction. His cool and critical 1925 &quot;Joyless Street&quot; is a landmark of the objective style. Other directors included Ernő Metzner, Berthold Viertel, and Gerhard Lamprecht.

==Literature==
The primary characteristic of New Objective literature was its political perspective on reality. It renders dystopias, in a non-sentimental, emotionless reporting style, with precision of detail and veneration for &quot;the fact&quot;. The works were seen to provide a rejection to humanism, a refusal to play the game of art as utopia, a negation of art as escapism, and a palpable cynicism about humanity. Authors associated with New Objectivity literature included Alfred Döblin, Hans Fallada, Irmgard Keun, Erich Kästner, and, in Afrikaans literature, Abraham Jonker, the father of poet Ingrid Jonker.

==Theater==
Bertolt Brecht, from his opposition to the focus on the individual in expressionist art, began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his Man Equals Man project. This approach to theater-craft began to be known as &quot;Brechtian&quot; and the collective of writers and actors who he worked with are known as the &quot;Brechtian collective&quot;.

==Music==

New Objectivity in music, as in the visual arts, rejected the sentimentality of late Romanticism and the emotional agitation of expressionism. Composer Paul Hindemith may be considered both a New Objectivist and an expressionist, depending on the composition, throughout the 1920s; for example, his wind quintet &#x27; Op. 24 No. 2 (1922) was designed as &#x27;; one may compare his operas &quot;Sancta Susanna&quot; (part of an expressionist trilogy) and &quot;&quot; (a parody of modern life). His music typically harkens back to baroque models and makes use of traditional forms and stable polyphonic structures, together with modern dissonance and jazz-inflected rhythms. Ernst Toch and Kurt Weill also composed New Objectivist music during the 1920s. Though known late in life for his austere interpretations of the classics, in earlier years, conductor Otto Klemperer was the most prominent to ally himself with this movement.

==Legacy==
The New Objectivity movement is usually considered to have ended with the Weimar Republic when the National Socialists under Adolf Hitler seized power in January 1933. The Nazi authorities condemned much of the work of the New Objectivity as &quot;degenerate art&quot;, so that works were seized and destroyed and many artists were forbidden to exhibit. A few, including Karl Hubbuch, Adolf Uzarski, and Otto Nagel, were among the artists entirely forbidden to paint. While some of the major figures of the movement went into exile, they did not carry on painting in the same manner. George Grosz emigrated to America and adopted a romantic style, and Max Beckmann&#x27;s work by the time he left Germany in 1937 was, by Franz Roh&#x27;s definitions, expressionism.

The influence of New Objectivity outside of Germany can be seen in the work of artists like Balthus, Salvador Dalí (in such early works as his &quot;Portrait of Luis Buñuel&quot; of 1924), Auguste Herbin, Maruja Mallo, Cagnaccio di San Pietro, Grant Wood, Adamson-Eric, and Juhan Muks.

<doc id="863997" wikidata="Q7729540" url="?curid=863997" title="The Deep (Crowley novel)">
<text>The Deep is a 1975 speculative fiction novel by American writer John Crowley, who described it as being &quot;based quite closely on events in the English Wars of the Roses&quot;. The novel is set in a medieval world where the two factions, the &quot;Reds&quot; and the &quot;Blacks&quot;, struggle for supremacy through battle.

== Plot ==
A visitor arrives in the conflict between the two factions, the &quot;Reds&quot; and the &quot;Blacks&quot;. It soon becomes apparent that he (it) is only superficially human. Damaged in a skirmish between Protectors and the Just at the start, he and we spend the rest of the book finding out how and why he was made and sent. Early, Fauconred quotes their book: &quot;the world is founded on a pillar which is founded on the Deep&quot;. This turns out to be true.

Whilst a war of succession plays out, the visitor becomes secretary, then recorder; and travels to the edge of the world to meet Leviathan, an immemorial creature who built the world to shelter his sleep from the heaven stones. Meanwhile, the slow stable world which has been immortal because repeating for uncounted years begins to spiral into the unknown path of development.

==Reception==
Critics Brian W. Aldiss and David Wingrove praised &quot;The Deep&quot; as &quot;a remarkable first novel, well written and darkly true to human nature.&quot; They described it as &quot;a complex novel of many layers [whose] people live and breathe and die horribly in [its] pages.

<doc id="864000" wikidata="Q333076" url="?curid=864000" title="Overproduction">
<text>In economics, overproduction, oversupply, excess of supply, or glut refers to excess of supply over demand of products being offered to the market. This leads to lower prices and/or unsold goods along with the possibility of unemployment.

The demand side equivalent is underconsumption; some consider supply and demand two sides to the same coin – excess supply is only relative to a given demand, and insufficient demand is only relative to a given supply – and thus consider overproduction and underconsumption equivalent.

In lean thinking, overproduction of goods or goods in process is seen as one of the seven wastes (Japanese term: &quot;muda&quot;) which do not add value to a product, and is considered &quot;the most serious&quot; of the seven. 
Overproduction is often attributed to previous overinvestment – creation of excess productive capacity, which must then either lie idle (or under capacity), which is unprofitable, or produce an excess supply.

== Explanation ==
Overproduction is the accumulation of unsaleable inventories in the hands of businesses. Overproduction is a relative measure, referring to the excess of production over consumption. The tendency for an overproduction of commodities to lead to economic collapse is specific to the capitalist economy. In previous economic formations, an abundance of production created general prosperity. However, in the capitalist economy, commodities are produced for monetary profit. This so-called profit motive, the core of the capitalist economy, creates a dynamic whereby an abundance of commodities has negative consequences. In essence, an abundance of commodities disrupts the conditions for the creation of profit.

The overproduction of commodities forces businesses to reduce production in order to clear inventories. Any reduction in production implies a reduction in employment. A reduction in employment, in turn, reduces consumption. As overproduction is the excess of production above consumption, this reduction in consumption worsens the problem. This creates a &quot;feed-back loop&quot; or &quot;vicious cycle&quot;, whereby excess inventories force businesses to reduce production, thereby reducing employment, which in turn reduces the demand for the excess inventories. The general reduction in the level of prices (deflation) caused by the law of supply and demand also forces businesses to reduce production as profits decline. Reduced profits render certain fields of production unprofitable.

Henry George argued that there could not be any such thing as overproduction in a general sense, but only in a relative sense:
Is there, then, such a thing as overproduction? Manifestly, there cannot be, in any general sense, until more wealth is produced than is wanted. In any unqualified sense, over- production is preposterous, when everywhere the struggle to get wealth is so intense; when so many must worry and strain to get a living, and there is actual want among large classes. The manner in which the strain of the war was borne shows how great are the forces of production which, in normal times, go to waste; proves that what we suffer from now is not overproduction, but underproduction.

Relative overproduction there, of course, may be. The desires for different forms of wealth vary in intensity and in sequence, and are related one with another. I may want both a pair of shoes and a dozen pocket-handkerchiefs, but my desire for the shoes is first and strongest; and upon the terms on which I can get the shoes may in large measure depend my ability to get the handkerchiefs. So, in the aggregate demand for the different forms of wealth, there is a similar relation. And as, under the division of labor characteristic of the modern industrial system, nearly all production is carried on with the view, not of consumption by the immediate producers, but of exchange for other productions, certain commodities may be produced so far in excess of their proper proportion to the production of other commodities, that the whole quantity produced cannot be exchanged for enough of those other commodities to give the usual returns to the capital and labor engaged in bringing them to market. This disproportionate production of some things, which is overproduction in relation to the production of other things, is the only kind of overproduction that can take place on any considerable scale, and the overproduction of which we hear so much is evidently of this character.

== Inevitability ==
Karl Marx outlined the inherent tendency of capitalism towards overproduction in his seminal work .

According to Marx, in capitalism, improvements in technology and rising levels of productivity increase the amount of material wealth (or use values) in society while simultaneously diminishing the economic value of this wealth, thereby lowering the rate of profit—a tendency that leads to the paradox, characteristic of crises in capitalism, of &quot;reserve army of labour&quot; and of “poverty in the midst of plenty”, or more precisely, crises of overproduction in the midst of underconsumption.

John Maynard Keynes formulated a theory of overproduction, which led him to propose government intervention to ensure effective demand. Effective demand are levels of consumption that corresponds to the level of production. If effective demand is achieved then there is no overproduction because all inventories are sold. Importantly, Keynes acknowledged that such measures could only delay and &quot;not&quot; solve overproduction.

== Say&#x27;s law ==

Say&#x27;s law states that &quot;The more goods &quot;[for which there is demand]&quot; that are produced, the more those goods (supply) can constitute a demand for other goods&quot;. Keynes summarized this &quot;law&quot; as asserting that &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot;. The consumer&#x27;s desire to trade causes the potential consumer to become a producer to create goods that can be exchanged for the goods of others, goods are directly or indirectly exchanged for other goods. Because goods can only be paid for by other goods, no demand can exist without prior production. Following Say&#x27;s law, overproduction (in the economy as a whole, specific goods can still be overproduced) is only possible in a limited sense.

==Environmental impact==
Overproduction raises issues about the disposal of excess product stocks, which may have a significant environmental impact as well as raising additional waste disposal costs. More raw materials than necessary will have been used in production and, in some production processes, more undesirable pollution may have arisen due to the excess level of productive activity.

<text>Joseph Habersham (July 28, 1751 – November 17, 1815) was an American businessman, Georgia politician, soldier in the Continental Army, and Postmaster General of the United States.

==Early years==
Born in Savannah, Georgia, to James Habersham and Mary Bolton, he attended preparatory schools and Princeton College and became successful merchant and planter. He was married to Isabella Rae, who was the sister-in-law of Col. Samuel Elbert. They had one son, Robert Habersham.

==American Revolution==
He was a member of the council of safety and the Georgia Provincial Council in 1775 and a major of a battalion of Georgia militiamen and subsequently a colonel in the 1st Georgia Regiment of the Continental Army. He had to resign from the army after he served as Lachlan McIntosh&#x27;s second in the controversial duel that killed Button Gwinnett.

==Political career==
He and his brothers, James Jr. and John, were active in Georgia politics. Some older references state that Joseph was a delegate to the Confederation Congress in 1785, but this may stem from confusion with his brother John, who was a delegate at that time. Joseph served as Speaker of the Georgia House in 1782 and again in 1785 and was a member of the Georgia convention in 1788 that ratified the U.S. Constitution.

He served as mayor of Savannah from 1792 to 1793 and then was appointed Postmaster General by President George Washington in 1795 and served until the beginning of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s administration in 1801. When Habersham created the office of first assistant postmaster-general in 1799, Abraham Bradley Jr. was appointed to the office. In 1802, Bradley named one of his sons, Joseph Habersham Bradley (later a notable Washington, D.C. attorney), after his former superior.

==Death and legacy==
Habersham died in 1815. He is buried in Savannah&#x27;s Colonial Park Cemetery. Habersham County in Northeast Georgia, from its creation in 1818, is named in his honor.

Joseph Habersham was also a Savannah Freemason. He is recorded as a masonic member of Solomon&#x27;s Lodge No. 1, F. &amp; A. M. at Savannah, Georgia. Solomon&#x27;s Lodge No. 1, F. &amp; A. M. at Savannah was founded by renowned statesman, philanthropist and Freemason James Edward Oglethorpe on February 21, 1734. Joseph Habersham&#x27;s father James Habersham, both of his brothers, and his noted descendant, the Savannah Painter, Richard West Habersham (the intimate friend of Samuel F. B. Morse inventor of the telegraph) were all Freemasons and members of Solomon&#x27;s Lodge.

The Joseph Habersham Chapter of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, located in Atlanta, is named in Habersham&#x27;s honor, as is their headquarters, Habersham Memorial Hall.

<text>Bédélia (in English usually written as &quot;Bedelia&quot;) was the archetype of the French cyclecars.

This automobile was manufactured by the Bourbeau et Devaux Co. of Paris from 1910 to 1925 to a design by Robert Bourbeau. Rather than scaling down existing motor-car designs, Bourbeau chose to adapt mainly motor-cycle practice for his design, giving rise to the cyclecar designation. The low and light car carried its two passengers in tandem with the passenger seated at the front, while in the rear was the person doing the steering. Single-cylinder or 10 hp V-twin engines were used. Drive was to the rear wheels through a belt which could be moved between pulleys to give a two speed transmission. The front axle was centre pivoted with suspension by a single mid mounted coil spring and the steering was by a cable and bobbin. Elliptic leaf springs were used at the rear. The method of changing gear was unusual. The rear driver had to operate a lever which slackened the belt by moving the rear axle forwards and then the passenger had to move the belt between pulleys by means of a separate lever. How the car was driven without a passenger is not explained. On later cars the levers were moved so that the driver could steer the car for himself. Before World War I, Bédélia cyclecars sold very well, even in Britain.

A Bédélia won the 1913 Cyclecar Grand Prix held at Amiens. A Morgan came in first, Morgan enthusiasts have claimed it as a win to the present day and it was largely on publicity from this success that Morgan broke into the French market, resulting in the creation of the Darmont company and, tangentially, Sandford. Nevertheless, the second placed French car was subsequently awarded the victory.

Manufacturing rights were obtained by a dealer, a Monsieur Binet in 1920 and he had an updated version of the cars made for him by Mahieux of Levallois-Perret, Seine. The body design was modified to let the driver and passengers sit and a conventional three speed gearbox was fitted. Engines of up to 990 cc were offered.

==Commercial==
The car&#x27;s launch coincided with a &quot;Petroleum/gasoline War&quot; involving the competing commercial interests of the United States, Romania and other countries. France, having no indigenous oil supplies of its own, and the Algerian reserves not yet discovered, was particularly badly hit, and government exacerbated the challenge for the infant auto-industry with new car taxes. The light-weight Bedélia cyclecar&#x27;s introduction was therefore timely. With the cyclecar boom over the company collapsed in 1925.

<text>James Boyce (6 September 1947 – 25 January 1994), known as Jimmy Boyce, was a British Labour politician.

He was a member of Sheffield Council from 1984 and was elected Member of Parliament for Rotherham in April 1992, but died less than 2 years later.

==Personal life==
James Boyce was born in 1947 in Paisley, Scotland, the son of James and Nellie Boyce. He came to settle in Sheffield, meeting and marrying Patricia Morton, with whom he had two sons, Jimmy and Calum. He was divorced in the late 1980s and remarried in April 1993.

==Career==
Boyce became involved in local politics through his father in-law, Alf Morton (who introduced him to the local Labour party). Boyce became involved in trade union activities while working in the then thriving steel works in Sheffield but, like many others, was made redundant in the early 1980s. He went on to study law at the then Sheffield Polytechnic but left during his second year. In 1984 he was elected as local councillor for the Burngreave ward in Sheffield.
He returned to Sheffield University to study Law in 1987 as a mature student and was a much-loved figure around the Law Department, known for his dry sense of humour and caring personality.

==Health and death==
On Christmas Eve 1993 he was put on the transplant waiting list for a new heart after what he thought was a respiratory problem after complaining of breathing problems. It turned out he was suffering from an enlarged heart. On Burns Night 1994 he suffered a fatal heart attack at home in his living room. Over 500 people attended his memorial service on 11 February 1994, at which a speaker was the then Labour Party leader John Smith, who, coincidentally, would also die of a heart attack just a week after the by-election to elect Boyce&#x27;s replacement was held.

<doc id="864014" wikidata="Q7694636" url="?curid=864014" title="Teflon-coated bullet">
<text>Teflon-coated bullets, sometimes colloquially known as &quot;cop killer bullets&quot;, are bullets that have been coated in polytetrafluoroethylene.

==History==
In the 1960s, Paul Kopsch (an Ohio coroner), Daniel Turcus (a police sergeant), and Donald Ward (Kopsch&#x27;s special investigator) began experimenting with special purpose handgun ammunition. Their objective was to develop a law enforcement round capable of improved penetration against hard targets, such as windshield glass and automobile doors. Conventional bullets, made primarily from lead, often become deformed and less effective after striking hard targets, especially when fired at handgun velocities. The inventors named their company &quot;KTW,&quot; after their initials.

After some experimentation with sintered tungsten-alloy Kennertium W-10 projectiles, which were eventually abandoned due to supply and cost concerns, the inventors settled on a bullet consisting mostly of hard brass and some with a steel projectile. In testing, the comparatively hard brass bullets wore out barrels far more quickly than standard solid lead and copper-jacketed lead rounds, since they did not deform to fit the rifling. In an attempt to reduce barrel wear, the steel projectiles had a copper cup which made contact with the rifling; on brass projectiles, brass driving bands are present to engage the rifling. Early KTWs were coated with Teflon. The inventors, having also noted that the tips of walking canes were frequently covered with the relatively soft and malleable Teflon to help them grip surfaces, found that the addition of Teflon helped to prevent bullet deflections from vehicle doors and windshields, further improving penetration against those surfaces.

In the late 1960s, KTW begun commercial production. In 1980, continued production of the ammunition was turned over to the North American Ordnance Corporation. The production of KTW-branded ammunition eventually ceased in the 1990s. However, some manufacturers continue to coat their bullets with various compounds, notably Teflon and molybdenum disulfide, as a protective layer against barrel wear.

Not a lot of performance data is available for these bullets, although the 9mm offering was reputed to push a projectile at a velocity of .

==Lethality debate==
In 1982, NBC broadcast a television special on Teflon-coated bullets that argued they were a serious threat to American law enforcement because of their supposedly increased ability to penetrate ballistic vests.
This led various US gun control organizations to label these types of bullets with the epithet &quot;cop killers&quot;. In 1983, US Representative Mario Biaggi reported that Du Pont Company officials agreed to stop selling teflon to individuals and companies that used it to make ammunition.

Several calibers of KTW rounds were proven to penetrate ballistic vests under certain conditions. However, their inventor Kopsch said in a 1990 interview that &quot;adding a Teflon coating to the round added 20% penetration power on metal and glass. Critics kept complaining about Teflon&#x27;s ability to penetrate body armor [...] In fact, Teflon cut down on the round&#x27;s ability to cut through the nylon or Kevlar of body armor.&quot;

==Legal status==
=== United States ===
The federal ban on armor-piercing pistol ammunition uses only the composition of the bullet&#x27;s core to determine legality. However, many individual states have legislation restricting various kinds of coating materials, for example:

* Alabama state law provides that &quot;the possession or sale of brass or steel teflon-coated handgun ammunition is illegal anywhere within the State of Alabama&quot;.
*Hawaii state law prohibits the &quot;manufacture, possession, sale, barter, trade, gift, transfer, or acquisition of ... any type of ammunition or any projectile component thereof coated with teflon or any other similar coating designed primarily to enhance its capability to penetrate metal or pierce protective armor.&quot;
* Kansas state laws states possessing, manufacturing, causing to be manufactured, selling, offering for sale, lending, purchasing or giving away any cartridge which can be fired by a handgun and which has a plastic-coated bullet that has a core of less than 60% lead by weight, whether the person knows or has reason to know that the plastic-coated bullet has a core of less than 60% lead by weight is unlawful.
* North Carolina state law specifically forbids persons in that state to &quot;import, manufacture, possess, store, transport, sell, offer to sell, purchase, offer to purchase, deliver or give to another, or acquire any Teflon-coated bullet&quot;.
* Oklahoma – Teflon-coated bullets are illegal in Oklahoma under some circumstances.
* Oregon state law forbids the possession of any handgun ammunition, the bullet or projectile of which is coated with Teflon while committing or intending to commit a felony.
* Pennsylvania state law provides that &quot;It is unlawful for any person to possess, use or attempt to use a KTW teflon-coated bullet or other armor-piercing ammunition while committing or attempting to commit&quot; certain enumerated &quot;crime[s] of violence&quot;.
* South Carolina state law specifically bans &quot;ammunition or shells that are coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon)&quot;.
* Virginia state law specifically bans &quot;bullets, projectiles or other types of ammunition that are: coated with or contain, in whole or in part, polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) or a similar product&quot; while committing or attempting to commit a crime.

<doc id="864017" wikidata="Q742129" url="?curid=864017" title="Planetary core">
<text>A planetary core consists of the innermost layers of a planet. Cores may be entirely liquid, or a mixture of solid and liquid layers as is the case in the Earth. In the Solar System, core sizes range from about 20% (the Moon) to 85% of a planet&#x27;s radius (Mercury).

Gas giants also have cores, though the composition of these are still a matter of debate and range in possible composition from traditional stony/iron, to ice or to fluid metallic hydrogen. Gas giant cores are proportionally much smaller than those of terrestrial planets, though they can be considerably larger than the Earth&#x27;s nevertheless; Jupiter&#x27;s is 10–30 times heavier than Earth, and exoplanet HD149026 b may have a core 100 times the mass of the Earth.

Planetary cores are challenging to study because they are impossible to reach by drill and there are almost no samples that are definitively from the core. Thus, they are studied via indirect techniques such as seismology, mineral physics, and planetary dynamics.

==Discovery==

=== Earth&#x27;s core ===

In 1797, Henry Cavendish calculated the average density of the Earth to be 5.48 times the density of water (later refined to 5.53), which led to the accepted belief that the Earth was much denser in its interior. Following the discovery of iron meteorites, Wiechert in 1898 postulated that the Earth had a similar bulk composition to iron meteorites, but the iron had settled to the interior of the Earth, and later represented this by integrating the bulk density of the Earth with the missing iron and nickel as a core. The first detection of Earth&#x27;s core occurred in 1906 by Richard Dixon Oldham upon discovery of the P-wave shadow zone; the liquid outer core. By 1936 seismologists had determined the size of the overall core as well as the boundary between the fluid outer core and the solid inner core.

=== Moon&#x27;s core ===
The internal structure of the Moon was characterized in 1974 using seismic data collected by the Apollo missions of moonquakes. The Moon&#x27;s core has a radius of 300 km. The Moon&#x27;s iron core has a liquid outer layer that makes up 60% of the volume of the core, with a solid inner core.

=== Cores of the rocky planets ===
The cores of the rocky planets were initially characterized by analyzing data from spacecraft, such as NASA&#x27;s Mariner 10 that flew by Mercury and Venus to observe their surface characteristics. The cores of other planets cannot be measured using seismometers on their surface, so instead they have to be inferred based on calculations from these fly-by observation. Mass and size can provide a first-order calculation of the components that make up the interior of a planetary body. The structure of rocky planets is constrained by the average density of a planet and its moment of inertia. The moment of inertia for a differentiated planet is less than 0.4, because the density of the planet is concentrated in the center. Mercury has a moment of inertia of 0.346, which is evidence for a core. Conservation of energy calculations as well as magnetic field measurements can also constrain composition, and surface geology of the planets can characterize differentiation of the body since its accretion. Mercury, Venus, and Mars’ cores are about 75%, 50%, and 40% of their radius respectively.

==Formation==

===Accretion===
Planetary systems form from flattened disks of dust and gas that accrete rapidly (within thousands of years) into planetesimals around 10 km in diameter. From here gravity takes over to produce Moon to Mars-sized planetary embryos (105 – 106 years) and these develop into planetary bodies over an additional 10–100 million years.

Jupiter and Saturn most likely formed around previously existing rocky and/or icy bodies, rendering these previous primordial planets into gas-giant cores. This is the planetary core accretion model of planet formation.

===Differentiation===
Planetary differentiation is broadly defined as the development from one thing to many things; homogeneous body to several heterogeneous components. The hafnium-182/tungsten-182 isotopic system has a half-life of 9 million years, and is approximated as an extinct system after 45 million years. Hafnium is a lithophile element and tungsten is siderophile element. Thus if metal segregation (between the Earth&#x27;s core and mantle) occurred in under 45 million years, silicate reservoirs develop positive Hf/W anomalies, and metal reservoirs acquire negative anomalies relative to undifferentiated chondrite material. The observed Hf/W ratios in iron meteorites constrain metal segregation to under 5 million years, the Earth&#x27;s mantle Hf/W ratio places Earth&#x27;s core as having segregated within 25 million years. Several factors control segregation of a metal core including the crystallization of perovskite. Crystallization of perovskite in an early magma ocean is an oxidation process and may drive the production and extraction of iron metal from an original silicate melt.

===Core merging and impacts===
Impacts between planet-sized bodies in the early Solar System are important aspects in the formation and growth of planets and planetary cores.

====Earth–Moon system====
The giant impact hypothesis states that an impact between a theoretical Mars-sized planet Theia and the early Earth formed the modern Earth and Moon. During this impact the majority of the iron from Theia and the Earth became incorporated into the Earth&#x27;s core.

====Mars====
Core merging between the proto-Mars and another differentiated planetoid could have been as fast as 1000 years or as slow as 300,000 years (depending on viscosity of both cores).

==Chemistry==

===Determining primary composition – Earth===

Using the chondritic reference model and combining known compositions of the crust and mantle, the unknown component, the composition of the inner and outer core, can be determined: 85% Fe, 5% Ni, 0.9% Cr, 0.25% Co, and all other refractory metals at very low concentration. This leaves Earth&#x27;s core with a 5–10% weight deficit for the outer core, and a 4–5% weight deficit for the inner core; which is attributed to lighter elements that should be cosmically abundant and are iron-soluble; H, O, C, S, P, and Si. Earth&#x27;s core contains half the Earth&#x27;s vanadium and chromium, and may contain considerable niobium and tantalum. Earth&#x27;s core is depleted in germanium and gallium.

===Weight deficit components – Earth===

Sulfur is strongly siderophilic and only moderately volatile and depleted in the silicate earth; thus may account for 1.9 weight % of Earth&#x27;s core. By similar arguments, phosphorus may be present up to 0.2 weight %. Hydrogen and carbon, however, are highly volatile and thus would have been lost during early accretion and therefore can only account for 0.1 to 0.2 weight % respectively. Silicon and oxygen thus make up the remaining mass deficit of Earth&#x27;s core; though the abundances of each are still a matter of controversy revolving largely around the pressure and oxidation state of Earth&#x27;s core during its formation. No geochemical evidence exists to include any radioactive elements in Earth&#x27;s core. Despite this, experimental evidence has found potassium to be strongly siderophilic at the temperatures associated with core formation, thus there is potential for potassium in planetary cores of planets, and therefore potassium-40 as well.

===Isotopic composition – Earth===

Hafnium/tungsten (Hf/W) isotopic ratios, when compared with a chondritic reference frame, show a marked enrichment in the silicate earth indicating depletion in Earth&#x27;s core. Iron meteorites, believed to be resultant from very early core fractionation processes, are also depleted. Niobium/tantalum (Nb/Ta) isotopic ratios, when compared with a chondritic reference frame, show mild depletion in bulk silicate Earth and the moon.

===Pallasite meteorites===
Pallasites are thought to form at the core-mantle boundary of an early planetesimal, although a recent hypothesis suggests that they are impact-generated mixtures of core and mantle materials.

==Dynamics==

===Dynamo===
Dynamo theory is a proposed mechanism to explain how celestial bodies like the Earth generate magnetic fields. The presence or lack of a magnetic field can help constrain the dynamics of a planetary core. Refer to Earth&#x27;s magnetic field for further details. A dynamo requires a source of thermal and/or compositional buoyancy as a driving force. Thermal buoyancy from a cooling core alone cannot drive the necessary convection as indicated by modelling, thus compositional buoyancy (from changes of phase) is required. On Earth the buoyancy is derived from crystallization of the inner core (which can occur as a result of temperature). Examples of compositional buoyancy include precipitation of iron alloys onto the inner core and liquid immiscibility both, which could influence convection both positively and negatively depending on ambient temperatures and pressures associated with the host-body. Other celestial bodies that exhibit magnetic fields are Mercury, Jupiter, Ganymede, and Saturn.

=== Core heat source ===
A planetary core acts as a heat source for the outer layers of a planet. In the Earth, the heat flux over the core mantle boundary is 12 terawatts. This value is calculated from a variety of factors: secular cooling, differentiation of light elements, Coriolis forces, radioactive decay, and latent heat of crystallization. All planetary bodies have a primordial heat value, or the amount of energy from accretion. Cooling from this initial temperature is called secular cooling, and in the Earth the secular cooling of the core transfers heat into an insulating silicate mantle. As the inner core grows, the latent heat of crystallization adds to the heat flux into the mantle.

===Stability and instability===
Small planetary cores may experience catastrophic energy release associated with phase changes within their cores. Ramsey (1950) found that the total energy released by such a phase change would be on the order of 1029 joules; equivalent to the total energy release due to earthquakes through geologic time. Such an event could explain the asteroid belt. Such phase changes would only occur at specific mass to volume ratios, and an example of such a phase change would be the rapid formation or dissolution of a solid core component.

=== Trends in the Solar System ===

==== Inner rocky planets ====
All of the rocky inner planets, as well as the moon, have an iron-dominant core. Venus and Mars have an additional major element in the core. Venus’ core is believed to be iron-nickel, similarly to Earth. Mars, on the other hand, is believed to have an iron-sulfur core and is separated into an outer liquid layer around an inner solid core. As the orbital radius of a rocky planet increases, the size of the core relative to the total radius of the planet decreases. This is believed to be because differentiation of the core is directly related to a body&#x27;s initial heat, so Mercury&#x27;s core is relatively large and active. Venus and Mars, as well as the moon, do not have magnetic fields. This could be due to a lack of a convecting liquid layer interacting with a solid inner core, as Venus’ core is not layered. Although Mars does have a liquid and solid layer, they do not appear to be interacting in the same way that Earth&#x27;s liquid and solid components interact to produce a dynamo.

==== Outer gas and ice giants ====
Current understanding of the outer planets in the solar system, the ice and gas giants, theorizes small cores of rock surrounded by a layer of ice, and in Jupiter and Saturn models suggest a large region of liquid metallic hydrogen and helium. The properties of these metallic hydrogen layers is a major area of contention because it is difficult to produce in laboratory settings, due to the high pressures needed. Jupiter and Saturn appear to release a lot more energy than they should be radiating just from the sun, which is attributed to heat released by the hydrogen and helium layer. Uranus does not appear to have a significant heat source, but Neptune has a heat source that is attributed to a “hot” formation.

==Observed types==
The following summarizes known information about the planetary cores of given non-stellar bodies.

===Within the Solar System===

====Mercury====
Mercury has an observed magnetic field, which is believed to be generated within its metallic core. Mercury&#x27;s core occupies 85% of the planet&#x27;s radius, making it the largest core relative to the size of the planet in the Solar System; this indicates that much of Mercury&#x27;s surface may have been lost early in the Solar System&#x27;s history. Mercury has a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid metallic outer core layer, followed by a deeper liquid core layer, and then a possible solid inner core making a third layer. The composition of the iron-rich core remains uncertain, but it likely contains nickel, silicon and perhaps sulfur and carbon, plus trace amounts of other elements.

====Venus====
The composition of Venus&#x27; core varies significantly depending on the model used to calculate it, thus constraints are required.
====Moon====
The existence of a lunar core is still debated; however, if it does have a core it would have formed synchronously with the Earth&#x27;s own core at 45 million years post-start of the Solar System based on hafnium-tungsten evidence and the giant impact hypothesis. Such a core may have hosted a geomagnetic dynamo early on in its history.

====Earth====
The Earth has an observed magnetic field generated within its metallic core. The Earth has a 5–10% mass deficit for the entire core and a density deficit from 4–5% for the inner core. The Fe/Ni value of the core is well constrained by chondritic meteorites. Sulfur, carbon, and phosphorus only account for ~2.5% of the light element component/mass deficit. No geochemical evidence exists for including any radioactive elements in the core. However, experimental evidence has found that potassium is strongly siderophile when dealing with temperatures associated with core-accretion, and thus potassium-40 could have provided an important source of heat contributing to the early Earth&#x27;s dynamo, though to a lesser extent than on sulfur rich Mars. The core contains half the Earth&#x27;s vanadium and chromium, and may contain considerable niobium and tantalum. The core is depleted in germanium and gallium. Core mantle differentiation occurred within the first 30 million years of Earth&#x27;s history. Inner core crystallization timing is still largely unresolved.

====Mars====
Mars possibly hosted a core-generated magnetic field in the past. The dynamo ceased within 0.5 billion years of the planet&#x27;s formation. Hf/W isotopes derived from the martian meteorite Zagami, indicate rapid accretion and core differentiation of Mars; i.e. under 10 million years. Potassium-40 could have been a major source of heat powering the early Martian dynamo.
Core merging between proto-Mars and another differentiated planetoid could have been as fast as 1000 years or as slow as 300,000 years (depending on the viscosity of both cores and mantles). Impact-heating of the Martian core would have resulted in stratification of the core and kill the Martian dynamo for a duration between 150 and 200 million years. Modelling done by Williams, et al. 2004 suggests that in order for Mars to have had a functional dynamo, the Martian core was initially hotter by 150 K than the mantle (agreeing with the differentiation history of the planet, as well as the impact hypothesis), and with a liquid core potassium-40 would have had opportunity to partition into the core providing an additional source of heat. The model further concludes that the core of mars is entirely liquid, as the latent heat of crystallization would have driven a longer-lasting (greater than one billion years) dynamo. If the core of Mars is liquid, the lower bound for sulfur would be five weight %.

====Ganymede====
Ganymede has an observed magnetic field generated within its metallic core.

====Jupiter====
Jupiter has an observed magnetic field generated within its core, indicating some metallic substance is present. Its magnetic field is the strongest in the Solar System after the Sun&#x27;s.

Jupiter has a rock and/or ice core 10–30 times the mass of the Earth, and this core is likely soluble in the gas envelope above, and so primordial in composition. Since the core still exists, the outer envelope must have originally accreted onto a previously existing planetary core. Thermal contraction/evolution models support the presence of metallic hydrogen within the core in large abundances (greater than Saturn).

====Saturn====
Saturn has an observed magnetic field generated within its metallic core. Metallic hydrogen is present within the core (in lower abundances than Jupiter).
Saturn has a rock and or ice core 10–30 times the mass of the Earth, and this core is likely soluble in the gas envelope above, and therefore it is primordial in composition. Since the core still exists, the envelope must have originally accreted onto previously existing planetary cores. Thermal contraction/evolution models support the presence of metallic hydrogen within the core in large abundances (but still less than Jupiter).

==== Remnant planetary cores ====
Missions to bodies in the asteroid belt will provide more insight to planetary core formation. It was previously understood that collisions in the solar system fully merged, but recent work on planetary bodies argues that remnants of collisions have their outer layers stripped, leaving behind a body that would eventually become a planetary core. The Psyche mission, titled “Journey to a Metal World,” is aiming to studying a body that could possibly be a remnant planetary core.

===Extrasolar===
As the field of exoplanets grows as new techniques allow for the discovery of both diverse exoplanets, the cores of exoplanets are being modeled. These depend on initial compositions of the exoplanets, which is inferred using the absorption spectra of individual exoplanets in combination with the emission spectra of their star.

====Chthonian planets====
A chthonian planet results when a gas giant has its outer atmosphere stripped away by its parent star, likely due to the planet&#x27;s inward migration. All that remains from the encounter is the original core.

====Planets derived from stellar cores and diamond planets====
Carbon planets, previously stars, are formed alongside the formation of a millisecond pulsar. The first such planet discovered was 18 times the density of water, and five times the size of Earth. Thus the planet cannot be gaseous, and must be composed of heavier elements that are also cosmically abundant like carbon and oxygen; making it likely crystalline like a diamond.

PSR J1719-1438 is a 5.7 millisecond pulsar found to have a companion with a mass similar to Jupiter but a density of 23 g/cm3, suggesting that the companion is an ultralow mass carbon white dwarf, likely the core of an ancient star.

====Hot ice planets====
Exoplanets with moderate densities (more dense than Jovian planets, but less dense than terrestrial planets) suggests that such planets like GJ1214b and GJ436 are composed of primarily water. Internal pressures of such water-worlds would result in exotic phases of water forming on the surface and within their cores.

<text>The Battle of Ulm on 16–19 October 1805 was a series of skirmishes, at the end of the Ulm Campaign, which allowed Napoleon I to trap an entire Austrian army under the command of Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich with minimal losses and to force its surrender near Ulm in the Electorate of Bavaria.

== Background ==
In 1805, the United Kingdom, the Austrian Empire, Sweden, and the Russian Empire formed the Third Coalition to overthrow the French Empire. When Bavaria sided with Napoleon, the Austrians, 72,000 strong under Mack, prematurely invaded while the Russians were still marching through Poland. 

The Austrians expected the main battles of the war to take place in northern Italy, not Germany, and intended only to protect the Alps from French forces.

A popular but apocryphal legend has it that while the Austrians used the Gregorian calendar, the Russians were still using the Julian calendar. This meant that their dates did not correspond, and the Austrians were brought into conflict with the French before the Russians could come into line. This simple but improbable explanation for the Russian army being far behind the Austrian is dismissed by scholar Frederick Kagan as &quot;a bizarre myth&quot;.

Napoleon had 177,000 troops of the at Boulogne, ready to invade England. They marched south on 27 August and by 24 September were ready to cross the Rhine from Mannheim to Strasbourg. After crossing the Rhine, the greater part of the French army made a gigantic right wheel so that its corps reached the Danube simultaneously, facing south. On 7 October, Mack learned that Napoleon planned to cross the Danube and march around his right flank so as to cut him off from the Russians who were marching via Vienna. He accordingly changed front, placing his left at Ulm and his right at Rain, but the French went on and crossed the Danube at Neuburg, Donauwörth, and Ingolstadt. Unable to stop the French avalanche, Michael von Kienmayer&#x27;s Austrian corps abandoned its positions along the river and fled to Munich.

On 8 October, Franz Xaver von Auffenberg&#x27;s division was cut to pieces by Joachim Murat&#x27;s Cavalry Corps and Jean Lannes&#x27; V Corps at the Battle of Wertingen. The following day, Mack attempted to cross the Danube and move north. He was defeated in the Battle of Günzburg by Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher&#x27;s division of Michel Ney&#x27;s VI Corps which was still operating on the north bank. During the action, the French seized a bridgehead on the south bank. After first withdrawing to Ulm, Mack tried to break out to the north. His army was blocked by Pierre Dupont de l&#x27;Etang&#x27;s VI Corps division and some cavalry in the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on 11 October.

By the 11th, Napoleon&#x27;s corps were spread out in a wide net to snare Mack&#x27;s army. Nicolas Soult&#x27;s IV Corps reached Landsberg am Lech and turned east to cut off Mack from Tyrol. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps and Louis Nicolas Davout&#x27;s III Corps converged on Munich. Auguste Marmont&#x27;s II Corps was at Augsburg. Murat, Ney, Lannes, and the Imperial Guard began closing in on Ulm. Mack ordered the corps of Franz von Werneck to march northeast, while Johann Sigismund Riesch covered its right flank at Elchingen. The Austrian commander sent Franz Jellacic&#x27;s corps south toward Tyrol and held the remainder of his army at Ulm.

== Battle ==
On 14 October, Ney crushed Riesch&#x27;s small corps at the Battle of Elchingen and chased its survivors back into Ulm. Murat detected Werneck&#x27;s force and raced in pursuit with his cavalry. Over the next few days, Werneck&#x27;s corps was overwhelmed in a series of actions at Langenau, Herbrechtingen, Nördlingen, and Neresheim. On 18 October, he surrendered the remainder of his troops. Only Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and a few other generals escaped to Bohemia with about 1,200 cavalry. Meanwhile, Soult secured the surrender of 4,600 Austrians at Memmingen and swung north to box in Mack from the south. Jellacic slipped past Soult and escaped to the south only to be hunted down and captured in the Capitulation of Dornbirn in mid-November by Pierre Augereau&#x27;s late-arriving VII Corps. By 16 October, Napoleon had surrounded Mack&#x27;s entire army at Ulm, and four days later Mack surrendered with 25,000 men, 18 generals, 65 guns, and 40 standards.

Some 20,000 escaped, 10,000 were killed or wounded, and the rest made prisoner. About 500 French were killed and 1,000 wounded, a low number for such a decisive battle. In less than 15 days the neutralized 60,000 Austrians and 30 generals. At the surrender (known as the &quot;Convention of Ulm&quot;), Mack offered his sword and presented himself to Napoleon as &quot;the unfortunate General Mack&quot;. Mack was court-martialed and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment.

== Aftermath ==

The Ulm Campaign is considered an example of a strategic victory, though Napoleon indeed had an overwhelming superior force. The campaign was won with no major battle. The Austrians fell into the same trap Napoleon had set at the Battle of Marengo, but unlike Marengo, the trap worked with success. Everything was made to confuse the enemy.

In his proclamation in the &quot;Bulletin de la Grande Armée&quot; of 21 October 1805 Napoleon said, &quot;Soldiers of the , I announced you a great battle. But thanks to the bad combinations of the enemy, I obtained the same success with no risk ... In 15 days we have won a campaign.&quot;

By defeating the Austrian army, Napoleon secured his conquest of Vienna, which was to be taken one month later.

Like the Battle of Austerlitz, the Ulm Campaign is still taught in military schools worldwide, and would continue to influence military leaders to present times, a notable example being that of the Schlieffen Plan developed by Germany to envelope what they assumed and expected would be French-led allied troops and win World War I. Indeed, Dupuy would say about the battle in his Harper Encyclopedia of Military History that it actually &quot;was not a battle; it was a strategic victory so complete and so overwhelming that the issue was never seriously contested in tactical combat. Also, This campaign opened the most brilliant year of Napoleon&#x27;s career. His army had been trained to perfection; his plans were faultless.&quot;

<text>System testing, a.k.a. end-to-end (E2E) testing, is testing conducted on a complete software system.

System testing describes testing as at the system level to contrast to testing at the integration or unit level.

System testing often serves the purpose of evaluating the system&#x27;s compliance with its specified requirements often from a functional requirement specification (FRS), a system requirement specification (SRS), another type of specification or multiple. 

System testing can detect defects in the system as a whole. 

System testing can verify the design, the behavior and even the believed expectations of the customer. It is also intended to test up to and beyond the bounds of specified software and hardware requirements.

==Approaches==
* Destructive testing: tests are carried out to the specimen&#x27;s failure, in order to understand a specimen&#x27;s performance or material behaviour under different loads.
* Nondestructive testing: analysis techniques to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.
*Fault injection: A testing technique which stress the system in an unusual way to examine the system behavior.

<doc id="864022" wikidata="Q7841902" url="?curid=864022" title="Trigram search">
<text>Trigram search is a method of searching for text when the exact syntax or spelling of the target object is not precisely known or when queries may be regular expressions. It finds objects which match the maximum number of three consecutive character strings (i.e. trigrams) in the entered search terms, which are generally near matches. Two strings with many shared trigrams can be expected to be very similar. Trigrams also allow for efficiently creating search engine indexes for searches that are regular expressions or match the text inexactly. Indexes can significantly accelerate searches. A threshold for number of trigram matches can be specified as a cutoff point, after a result is unmatched.

Using trigrams for accelerating searches is a technique used in some systems for code searching, in situations in which queries that are regular expressions may be useful, in search engines such as Elasticsearch, as well as in databases such as PostgreSQL.

== Examples ==
Consider the string &quot;alice&quot;. The trigrams of the string would be &quot;ali&quot;, &quot;lic&quot;, and &quot;ice&quot;, not including spaces. Searching for this string in a database with a trigram-based index would involve finding which objects contain as many of the three trigrams as possible.

As a concrete example of using trigram search to search for a regular expression query, consider searching for the string codice_1, where the brackets denote that the third character in the string being searched for could be codice_2 or codice_3. In this situation, one could query the index for objects that have the two trigrams codice_4 and codice_5 or the two trigrams codice_6 and codice_7. Thus, finding this query would involve no string matching, and could just query the index directly, which can be faster in practice.

<doc id="864023" wikidata="Q1269052" url="?curid=864023" title="Dynamix">
<text>Dynamix, Inc. was an American developer of video games from 1984 to 2001, best known for the flight simulator &quot;Red Baron&quot;, the puzzle game &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot;, the &quot;Front Page Sports&quot; series, &quot;Betrayal at Krondor,&quot; and the online multiplayer game &quot;Tribes&quot;.

==History==
The company was founded in Eugene, Oregon in 1984 by Jeff Tunnell and Damon Slye. Their first title, &quot;Stellar 7&quot;, was released before company founding and was later remade with the Dynamix name on it. They made a number of games for the Commodore 64, among them Project Firestart, which was one of the most atmospheric titles for the C64.

In the following years, Dynamix created a line of action games for Penguin Software and Electronic Arts, including one of the first games for the Amiga, &quot;Arcticfox&quot;. Later titles were developed for Activision. After self-publishing their games for a short while, in 1990 Dynamix was bought by Sierra On-Line.

Dynamix had published &quot;A-10 Tank Killer&quot; and distributed it through Mediagenic, but the acquisition occurred during the development of &quot;Red Baron&quot;, which became the first game in Dynamix&#x27;s &quot;Great Warplanes&quot; flight simulator series published by Sierra. Dynamix created some of their most famous games, including a line of adventures and simulators that included &quot;Red Baron&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Willy Beamish&quot;. They also created the puzzle game &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot;, along with the spinoff &quot;Sid &amp; Al&#x27;s Incredible Toons&quot;. Another successful product line was the Front Page Sports series, designed by Pat Cook and Allen McPheeters which included Football, Baseball, and Golf. Versions of Red Baron and Front Page Sports Football were included as part of the ImagiNation Network.

As a developer, Dynamix was notable for their early use of digitized graphics, animations and sounds effects in PC, Atari ST and Amiga games. The techniques were first used in 1988 in &quot;Pete Rose Pennant Fever&quot;, and used most notably in movie tie-in games like Die Hard and Ghostbusters II, as well as David Wolf: Secret Agent and Death Track.

By 1994 Slye agreed with a &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; statement that &quot;Now when someone hears &#x27;Dynamix&#x27; they immediately think &#x27;flight simulator&#x27;&quot;. In 1994, the first game in a new series called &quot;Metaltech&quot; was released, a giant robot combat game with similarities to the &quot;BattleTech&quot; universe and games. This series resulted in two &quot;Earthsiege&quot; games and eventually &quot;Starsiege&quot;. As a side development of the &quot;Starsiege&quot; game, the successful &quot;Tribes&quot; series was created. Dynamix also created &quot;Outpost 2: Divided Destiny&quot;, the second game in Sierra&#x27;s strategy/survival franchise, &quot;Outpost&quot;.

The Dynamix studio was closed by Sierra On-Line on August 14, 2001, as part of Sierra&#x27;s restructuring under Vivendi Universal Interactive Publishing. Several veterans of the studio (including Tunnell), however, stayed in Eugene and founded a new studio / electronic publisher, GarageGames.

==Torque Game Engine==

Some of the core Dynamix members started GarageGames, an independent-friendly engine developer and game publisher. They negotiated an agreement with Sierra for the source code to the Tribes 2 game engine. After reworking the code, GarageGames released it as a V12 but were soon told that an engine already had the name, so it was then called the Torque Game Engine (or TGE). The source code for TGE, a professional-grade 3D engine, was available to nearly anyone for fees starting at USD$100, but has since been released as open source under the MIT License.

<doc id="864026" wikidata="Q1139995" url="?curid=864026" title="MV Agusta">
<text>MV Agusta (, full name: MV AGUSTA Motor S.p.A., original name: Meccanica Verghera Agusta or MV) is an Italian high end motorcycle manufacturer. It was founded by Count Domenico Agusta on 19 January 1945 as one of the branches of the Agusta aircraft company near Milan in Cascina Costa. The abbreviation MV stands for &quot;Meccanica&quot; (mechanics) &quot;Verghera&quot;, the hamlet where the first MVs were made. The modern headquarters and main production facilities are located in Varese, Italy on the shore of Lake Varese.

==History==

=== 1943–1945: From idea to mass production ===

The genesis of the Agusta company came in the early 20th century. Count Giovanni Agusta left Sicily for northern Italy, where he built his first aircraft, the AG.1, four years after the Wright brothers had made history in the US.

The First World War, which demonstrated the prospects of aviation, prompted Agusta to be decisive. In 1923, in the town of Samarate, he founded the Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni Agusta S.A. (usually shortened to Agusta) aircraft factory. He died in 1927 at the age of 48, leaving his life&#x27;s work to his wife Giuseppina and his sons, Domenico, Vincenzo, Mario and Corrado.

Aircraft orders were plentiful and business generally went well until 1945, when provisions of the peace treaty that ended World War II (reiterated in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947), forbid Italy from producing aircraft. Acting quickly to save their business and their employees&#x27; jobs, the Agustas turned to an idea formulated by Count Domenico Agusta during the war. Domenico believed that the business could best be diversified and made peaceful by commencing the production of motorcycles, which would be needed by a country gutted by war.

On January 19, 1945, in the town of Cascina Costa (near the Malpensa airport near Milan), a private company, Meccanica Verghera S.r.l., was registered. Using an engine that had been prepared by August 1943—a 98 cc single-cylinder two-stroke with a two-stage gear box—and spare parts obtained from the black market to bypass shortages, a prototype motorcycle was constructed. The prototype was exhibited to the press in late October 1945 at a dealership on Via Piatti in Milan. It was light motorcycle with a steel tube rigid frame, a girder fork, 19-inch wheels, and a gas tank marked with a large M and V. It was initially called &quot;Vespa 98&quot; before being renamed to &quot;MV 98&quot; to avoid confusion with the Vespa motorscooter produced by Piaggio.

The MV 98 was first produced en masse in 1946. Two versions were sold to consimers: Economica, based on the prototype presented a year earlier, and Turismo, distinguished by the presence of a three-speed gearbox and a rear suspension. The Turismo proved to be so overwhelmingly popular that before long, the Economica was discontinued. In 1946, about 50 units were produced.

=== 1945–1980: Agusta family period ===
Count Domenico Agusta had a passion for mechanical workings and for motorcycle racing. Much like Enzo Ferrari, the Agusta family produced and sold motorcycles almost exclusively to fund their racing efforts. So soon after the start of production of its first model MV 98, the company launched its own factory racing program.

The date of the first MV Agusta race is unknown, but the first victory was delivered by Vicenzo Nincioni in the road race held in La Spezia on October 6, 1946. Just a week later, he took the third place in Valenza, where the first place was also taken by the MV racer Mario Cornalea. On November 3, in Monza, MV racers Vicenzo Ninconi, Mario Cornalea and Mario Paleari occupied the entire podium for the first time in MV racing history.

In the end of 1946, a special racing motorcycle was assembled at the factory in Caschina Costa. Its main advantages over the serial model 98 were a telescopic fork and a plunger type rear suspension. The frame remained a simple tubular (closed type) and was shortened by 50 mm to improve the handling. The handle bar was narrowed and the rearsets were moved back to make a sportier riding position. The two-stroke engine was improved by enlarging the cylinders ports, raising the compression ratio and installing a new 20 mm horizontal carburetor. The number of gears was increased from two to three. As a result, the power increased to 5 hp at 5,400 rpm, and the maximum speed increased to 95 km/h.

Soon almost all of these improvements were also applied on the production model MV 98. By that time, the capacity of 98 cc was no longer relevant in racing world, which had become more organized and moved on to the classic 125, 250 and 500 cc categories.

In 1947, MV Agusta went to the Milan Trade Fair with a number of new features. In addition to a &quot;Luxury&quot; version of the 98, the two-cylinder, two-stroke 125 cc bikes and the 250 cc single-cylinder 4T bikes appeared.

Technical characteristics of the MV Agusta 250 Turismo were regular for those times. Its single-cylinder engine with compression ratio 6.0:1 produced 11 hp at 4,700 rpm allowing the motorcycle to speed up to 110 km/h. Only 100 units of the MV 250 Turismo were produced within three years.

The model with a 125 cc two-stroke twin engine had a very similar design to the MV 98. The only differences were a four-speed gearbox and two cylinders instead of one. This model was well received by the press as well as by the audience of many motorcycles shows. However this model didn&#x27;t go to serial production mainly because its high price. Instead of this model MV Agusta launched a more affordable 125 Turismo, which was the result of the development of the original MV 98. It was powered by a 123.5 cc (53 × 56 mm) single-cylinder engine shoving out 4.8 hp and equipped by a girder fork.

Together with the 125 Turismo, MV introduced 125 Corsa designed for national and world championships. The power increased up to 9 hp. Its steel trellis frame, fabricated from thinner tubing, helped to reduce the weight from 75 to 55 kg. Two friction dampers had been added. And both wheels were replaced with 21-inch ones in accordance with the technical regulations of the races.

The bike was good enough to help Franco Bertoni to win the 1948 Grand Prix of Nations at Monza. In the 1949 season, the 125 cc, or ultra-light weight class, gained new prestige. More motorcycle manufacturers were competing in the inaugural world championships that were held in Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. The Mondial 125 cc DOHC design dominated the 1949 season.

In the end of 1949, Count Domenico Agusta invited two key professionals from Gilera – Piero Remor, who designed Gilera&#x27;s four-cylinder 500cc racing motorcycle, and Arturo Magni, who was the chief mechanic of the Gilera&#x27;s racing team. So they repeated a 500 cc four-cylinder engine and designed a racing model with 125 cc DOHC single-cylinder engine. The MV&#x27;s first 500 – a Gilera clone – made its race debut at Spa-Francorchamps in July 1950, just six months after Remor had put pen to paper in MV&#x27;s Cascina Costa race shop. After a short twenty-minute run on the factory test bench, ex-Gilera rider Arcisco Artesiani managed a creditable fifth on the untested and ungainly MV 500. His race average speed of 160.66 km/h was impressive, but the remainder of the season proved difficult and the MV failed to live up to expectations. Artesiani&#x27;s third place at Monza in the Nations Grand Prix was the highlight of the 1950 season, and Artesiani finished eighth overall in the World Championship.

The MV&#x27;s first racing success came later with the 125cc DOHC four-stroke engine. The 1950 season and 1951 season were development years. Racing efforts only produced a fifth-place finish at the Dutch TT in 1950. The 1951 results were only slightly better. The 1952 season saw the introduction of telescopic forks, full width alloy brake hubs and a sleek fuel tank on the 125 cc race bike. Britain&#x27;s Cecil Sandford piloted the new MV 125 to a 1952 Isle of Man TT victory and went on to win MV Agusta&#x27;s first world championship. And in September that year Leslie Graham made Count Agusta the happiest man alive by winning MV&#x27;s first 500 cc Grand Prix, on the hallowed asphalt of Monza, beating Gilera&#x27;s Umberto Masetti by 58 seconds. Giuseppe Commendatore Gilera was so incensed that he lodged a protest, claiming MV&#x27;s engine was oversize. It wasn&#x27;t.

In 1952, the Agusta factory started building helicopters under licence to American manufacturer Bell. And aviation once again became fundamental to the Count&#x27;s business. Although MV Agusta continued to sell small numbers of exotic road bikes, from this moment on racing was a hobby for Count Domenico. Helicopters made him a fortune, which he spent on racing. Aviation technology also served him well on the racetrack. His Grand Prix bikes were constructed using the same high-tech casting, forging and machining techniques used in the manufacture of his helicopters.

At that time MV product line-up consisted of motorcycles and scooters with two-stroke engines, with a capacity from 98 to 150 cc. But people who lived in mountainous areas always preferred four-stroke engines because of their torque. So Remor was tasked to design a four-stroke road model.

At the end of 1952, the MV Agusta 175 was released in two versions: CST and CSTL. It was their first production machine with a four-stroke engine. The unit construction single-cylinder engine was designed with an overhead camshaft for high performance. The chain-driven camshaft operated the valves via rocker arms, which were closed by hairpin valve springs. The engine was inclined forward at 10° and manufactured in alloy and a bore and stroke of 59.5 × 62 mm. This model had a frame of a double loop design using tubes for the front sections and pressed steel members at the rear. The engine was used as a stressed member. Suspension was telescopic forks at the front and a swinging arm at the rear. The 175 CST was equipped with separate saddles and 17&quot; wheels, the CSTL (&quot;Turismo Lusso&quot;) had 19&quot; wheels and a &quot;long seat&quot; (dualseat) fitted. The 175 CST weighed 103 kg and figured top speed of 100 km/h.

In less than a year MV Agusta introduced a sportier version 175 CS with a larger carburetor (22 mm instead of 18 mm), a higher compression ratio, a larger cylinder head with bigger fins, aluminum wheel rims and plenty of glossy red paint. Its 175 cc one-cylinder engine produced 11 hp at 6700 rpm, giving a 115 km/h top speed. This model featured lower handlebars, a more sporty riding position and a beautifully sculpted fuel tank that quickly earned it the unofficial nickname &quot;Disco Volante&quot; (English: flying saucer) as, viewed from the front, the tank shape was reminiscent of a flying saucer.

In July 1954, MV began offering a very limited-availability racing model 175 CSS (&quot;Super Sport&quot;). The engine was further turned from the CS model, including higher compression ratio and a larger carburetor, to produce 15 hp at 8,800 rpm. Cycle parts were the same as the CS model, except it was fitted with Earles forks.

In 1955, MV Agusta designed the 175 CSS-5V for the 175 cc &quot;Formula Sport Derivata&quot; race series. The &quot;Squalo&quot; (English: shark), as it was generally known, had a lighter frame based on that used on the works racers, larger brakes, a magneto, Earles forks and a five-speed gearbox. The bike became the part of motorcycle racing history thanks to the first victory of young Mike Hailwood, the future nine-time world champion. Mike won his first ever race on one of these machines bored out to 196 cc in a 200-cc class race at Oulton Park in 1957. Around 200 of the model were manufactured between 1954 and 1957.

The 175 cc engine became famous not only in road racing. From 1955 to 1958, MV also produced off-road racing motorcycles. But, perhaps, the most unexpected option manufactured in the same years was the trike Motocarro with a load capacity of 300 kg.

Unfortunately the 175 cc family had a considerable drawback. In fact, the flip side of its advantages. After all, the motorcycle was designed by the racing engineer, who spent the best part of his life following the rule brilliantly formulated by Ferdinand Porsche: &quot;The perfect racing car crosses the finish line first and subsequently falls into its component parts&quot;. Four-stroke 175-cc MV Agusta engines were distinguished by excellent dynamics at that time, but not durability. They were even given the nickname &quot;Fragile Diamonds&quot;. In addition, the upper camshaft complicated the procedure for cleaning carbon deposits, which was required several times a season due to the quality of oil and fuel. Therefore, for the new 125cc motorcycle, which was supposed to replace two-stroke models, a simplified version of the four-stroke engine was developed, with pushrods operating the valves.

The model debuted in 1954 in two versions: Turismo Rapido (6.5 hp) and Rapido Sport (7.5 hp). The chassis was similar to the 175-cc models (although the first units used a fully tubular frame, it was soon replaced by the same mixed design as the 175 CST), but a radical improvement appeared on the Rapido Sport was a hydraulically damped telescopic fork.

Now Italian engineers were ready to take the next step: to increase capacity up to 250 cc. In the fall of 1956, the company introduced the 250 Raid. Its name seemed to hint: the toys were over, it was time to go on a long journey – at least across Europe (the name was chosen by voting among dealers of the brand). Technically, the motorcycle became the development of a 125-cc model: a single-cylinder four-stroke overhead valve (OHV) engine, a four-speed gearbox, a duplex frame closed through the crankcase of the power unit. Of course, everything was done much more solidly, so the dry weight of the motorcycle increased from 102 to 160 kg. As a result, 14 hp engine could hardly power this bike to 115 km/h. In addition, the motorcycle looked like a clone of the junior models, with no hints of its high status. All of that generated low demand. In 1959, in an attempt to recover the poor sales of the 250, the company introduced a 16-hp 300-cc version. Army and police purchased a small number of these motorcycles in respective versions, but the overall sales were far from brilliant. As a result, the success hoped for was not realized with only 544 250-cc machines and about 500 300-cc machines being produced.

Trying to completely rid the brand of the dubious fame of &quot;fragile diamonds&quot;, the company&#x27;s engineers completely redesigned the lubrication system by the 1959 season: they installed a high-performance oil pump, a centrifugal oil filter, and increased the volume of the pan. The main new MV Agusta 125 TRE advertising message was focused on its reliability and assured 100,000 km mileage without any problems, for which the model was nicknamed &quot;Centomila&quot; (English: one hundred thousand).

In 1958, responding to the new Italian Road Law (Italian: Codice della strada), which closed highways for motorcycles of 125 cc or less, the company released a 150-cc version of the MV Agusta 150 RS (Rapido Sport). Its 10 hp engine accelerating the motorcycle up to 110 km/h, allowed it to stay in the stream (the most popular car of those times – the Fiat 500 – had a lower maximum speed). The same engine, detuned to 7 hp, was also installed on the small three-wheeled scooter Centauro. This machine with a load capacity of 350 kg already had a cab.

In 1957, MV produced a cheaper version of the 175-cc engine with a camshaft located in the engine block. Later in 1959, this engine bored up to 232 cc became a heart of a new motorcycle – Tevere (English: Tiber). In fact, the 11 hp Tevere was a more dynamic and less affordable version of MV Agusta 150 RS, so the model was discontinued soon. But the 232-cc engine itself, equipped with forced cooling, was produced until 1968, to complete the Trasporto Tevere cargo scooter.

A new family of ultralight (only 83 kg for basic version) Checca motorcycles debuted in 1960 to replace the Ottantatrè model. Technically Checca was similar to the 125-cc Centomila, but with a scaled parts. The basic version GT was equipped with an 83-cc 4 hp engine, an upper level GTE version had a 99-cc 5.15-hp engine and the Sport version had a 99-cc 6.5-hp engine. In 1962, the family was supplemented the GTL version with a 125-cc 5.5-hp engine. The family was in production for totally 9 years, however it had no big commercial success.

The 1958 Italian Road Law (Italian: Codice della strada) defined a new category &quot;ciclomotore&quot;: a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with engine capacity 50 cc or less and speed 40 km/h or less. Italian motorcycle industry saw in the new law an opportunity to attract younger riders’ audience. MV Agusta from its side presented Liberty family in 1962. In fact, it was the same Checca, but even more lightweight and simplified, with a 47.7-cc 1.5-hp engine at 4,500 rpm. An interesting fact that sales of the Liberty Sport version significantly exceeded the sales of the basic Liberty Turismo.

After the 1957 season, the Italian motorcycle manufacturers Gilera, Moto Guzzi and Mondial jointly agreed to withdraw from Grand Prix competition due to escalating costs and diminishing sales. Count Agusta originally agreed to withdraw, but then had second thoughts. MV Agusta went on to dominate Grand Prix racing, winning 17 consecutive 500-cc world championships. Count Agusta&#x27;s competitive nature drove him to hire some of the best riders of the time, including Carlo Ubbiali, John Surtees, Mike Hailwood, Giacomo Agostini, Phil Read, and the best engineers, in particular Arturo Magni. The three- and four-cylinder race bikes were known for their excellent road handling. The fire-engine red racing machines became a hallmark of Grand Prix racing in the 1960s and early 1970s.

In the early 1960s, MV Agusta decided to return to offroad sport (at the end of the 1950s, MV racers were successful in enduro races, including in the famous Six Days race). A new 125 Regolarita was created by order of Fiamme Oro team. The model was equipped with a 125-cc engine boosted up to 12.5 hp and a five-speed gearbox. Traditionally light MV frame was reinforced with a lower subframe, becoming closed. 19-inch wheels got offroad tyres. This motorcycle became successful, so tens such motorcycles were also sold amateur racers. Moreover, a five-speed gearbox has become standard for 125-cc and 150-cc road motorcycles since 1966, the factory line-up was supplemented by the Scrambler version.

The main MV premiere at the 1965 EICMA Milan Motorcycle Show was the flagship model 600 with an inline-four 590-cc engine. Such significant novelty put the all new two-cylinder line-up on the background. Most probably it happened also because of the new two-cylinder motorcycles had a regular look, very similar to the previous motorcycles.

The MV Agusta 250 B (&quot;Bicilindrica&quot;) had a 247 cc (53 × 56 mm) four-stroke parallel twin engine, a battery ignition system, two carburetors and a five-speed gearbox. Its 19 hp were enough to achieve 135 km/h. But the price was too high, and the characteristics were not the most impressive, which is why by the end of 1970 the total number of released three versions barely reached 1,452 units, and the model gave way to another generation, a much more successful MV Agusta 350 B with engine bored out to 349 cc.

Motorcycles MV Agusta became more advanced, with modern electrical equipment and improved suspensions. At the same time MV Agusta kept the look of its motorcycles almost unchanged. Meanwhile, the 1960s became a turning point in motorcycle design world, and other Italian companies set new design excellence standards not supported by MV Agusta with its motorcycles&#x27; look &quot;from the 1950s&quot;. The first significant design improvement became only in 1970, however it was not well accepted by customers and the second change became in 1971. The changes included elongated gas tanks, front forks without covers, low handlebars, saddles with a &quot;hump&quot;.

The new MV Agusta 125 Sport entered the market in 1974. Now, the design was one step ahead! The straightened lines that were just coming into fashion reflected the trend set a year earlier by the prototype MV Agusta 350 Ipotesi. Even the fins and the crankcase got square-shape. Some of the motorcycles were equipped with a Grand Prix type fairing. Technical advantages included fully enclosed, fully tubular duplex frame, front disc brake and electronic ignition system.

Alas, it was the last development of one- and two-cylinder motorcycles. The heirs of Domenico Agusta did not have passion to the motorcycle business and it declined soon. The last MV motorcycle manufactured in the company&#x27;s old factory was 125 Sport in 1977.

====Spanish production====
Count Agusta had plans to expand the MV Agusta brand internationally. In post-Civil War Spain, the Franco regime banned the import of motorcycles and also forbade foreign nationals from settling in Spain, or starting a business there. Brothers Mario and Natale Corando and financiers Enrique Favier and Antonio Sommariva wanted to set up manufacture of MV machines under licence by a local factory, which had licenses and manufacturing permits and therefore had access to raw materials. A deal was struck with Nilo Masó of Alpha in Barcelona and MV Alpha was formed in 1948.

Sales were good, but because of the limited facilities of Alpha, production could not be increased. The licence to produce MV motorcycles was transferred to the larger and better equipped Avello factory in the Natahoyo neighbourhood of Gijón in Asturias in 1951, creating the MV Avello brand. Production in Spain continued until 1972.

==== 1967–1974: World&#x27;s first production transverse 4-cylinder motorcycles ====
Inline 4-cylinder engines have been a modern characteristic feature of MV Agusta. For the first time this type of engine designed by Pierro Remor was used in the 1950 Grand Prix season. In the mid-1960s, when the demand for large engine capacity motorcycles grew, there was born an idea to apply it on a road bike (the first prototype MV Agusta 500 Grand Turismo R19 was built in 1951). It was rumored that preventing any competition Count Agusta ordered to build the road vehicle with no possibility of converting it into a racing one. Therefore, the MV Agusta 600 debuted at the Milan Trade Fair in 1965 was deliberately distinguished by the massive parts of the 592-cc engine, final shaft drive and weighed 221 kg. It became the world&#x27;s first production motorcycle with a four-cylinder transverse engine. Four-cylinder motorcycles such as the FN Four had been in production since 1905, but they all had longitudinal engines.
It was followed by models with engines with a displacement of 743, 790, 837 and 862 cm3, including the legendary 750 Sport and 750 Sport America. Even when the company canceled motorcycle production in 1977, Arturo Magni was authorized to produce and sell motorcycles under the MV Agusta brand on its own. The most advanced model, the 1978 Grand Prix 1100, developed 119 hp, weighed only 202 kg and accelerated from 0–100 km/h in 3.9 sec.

The history of the 750 S America model began when Chris Garville and Jim Cotherman of Commerce Overseas Corporation, the US MV importers, got the idea that with a few modifications, the MV 750 S had great potential in the United States. In the autumn of 1974, they travelled to Italy to discuss these upgrades which were rather well received by Cascina Costa. Result-oriented, the two American businessmen called for an improved design and performance (&quot;style and speed&quot;) and announced that they could sell hundreds of this new machine.

In terms of style, the 750 Sport America features a sporty look reminiscent of a &quot;Luxury Café Racer&quot;. It was equipped with a 19-litre fuel tank, a small racing mudguard, a single-seater covered in black alcantara fabric and four exhausts. In terms of performance, the engine&#x27;s displacement was increased to 790 cc and is now powered by four 26 mm Dell&#x27;Orto concentric-shaft carburettors (smaller than those of the 750 S, they have the added advantage of remaining stable on bumpy roads). The buyer could either choose four chrome-plated megaphones or else, exhausts with a matt black finish producing a more acceptable noise level.

With a compression ratio of 9.5:1, the four-cylinder produced 75 hp and could take the 750 America to nearly 210 km/h at 8,500 rpm. The America was equipped with a 38 mm Ceriani front fork and a double disc at the front similar to that of the last 750 S.

However, the dealers&#x27; hopes did not materialize: there were few customers ready to pay $6,500 for 750 Sport America (for comparison, the Honda CB750 cost $2,190) and only 540 units were produced.

==== 1973–1977: Revolutionary 350 cc ====

MV Agusta 350 S Ipotesi was an example of a car designer&#x27;s experience in a motorcycle world. It was in production for only two years, and 1,991 units were made. But this happened most probably due to the change of business focuses of the company after Count Domenico Agusta&#x27;s death. Anyway the design of the MV Agusta 350 S has become decisive in the industry for the next 15 years. While almost all motorcycle designers were focused on round shapes, MV Agusta presented at 1973 Milan Motorcycle Show a prototype 350 Ipotesi that was characterised by horizontal lines and sharp angles. It was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, founder of Italdesign. The bike used cast alloy wheels and triple disc brakes which were a significant innovation for that time.

Two years later this model named 350 S went into production. It kept even the squared external cases of the engine, despite the fact that the basic motor internals were identical to the previous 350 twin model. Output was increased from 27 hp at 7800 rpm to 34 hp at 8500 rpm claimed.

==== 1946–1977: Experiments, concepts and non-standard vehicles ====
MV Agusta is famous by its experiments and expands of the range. In 1949, the company launched production of scooters. From 1955 till 1969, MV produced mopeds. In 1975, the company presented the Mini Moto 4 V that looked like MV racing bikes (including even four exhausts and &quot;Grand Prix&quot; front fairing) but it had a 50-cc engine with 1.5 hp only.

The two seater car Vetturetta 350 (English: microcar), presented in 1953, was designed by Pierro Remor to demonstrate the potential of the young company. Of course it has never been brought to market. Now it&#x27;s part of a motoring exhibition at the MV Agusta Museum.

But MV Agusta also produced lightweight commercial vehicles that were actively sold and used.

The first production three-wheeled delivery truck (Italian: motocarro) appeared in 1947 and had the same 98-cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine as that used in MV 98. It was an odd-looking vehicle with a wooden front-loading bed and a steering wheel. In 1948, several commercial MVs came with a 125-cc two-stroke single-cylinder engine with a three-speed gearbox. In 1949, this engine was replaced with the new four-speed 125 cc.  

The second edition of the MV Agusta&#x27;s commercial three-wheeler – the 175 Motocarro – was presented in 1954. There were several advancements compared to the 98. The steering wheel was replaced by a handlebar. The engine was a 172.3-cc four-stroke derived from the 175 CST (1954) with a single overhead cam. The load bay was at the rear and was made of metal. The wheels were much larger in diameter (17&quot;) and the load capacity was of 350 kg.

In 1958, the company unveiled the 150 Centauro RF model. It was the third ‘transport’ vehicle from MV Agusta, and the first with a cab. The 150 cc four-stroke engine was based on the 125 cc unit found in the Turismo Rapido (1954), though this also got a cooling fan. All that yielded 7 hp through a four-speed (plus reverse) gearbox, good for a top speed of about 60 km/h. In 1961, the 150 Centauro RF was replaced by the modernized 150 Centauro RBF with an engine that was derived from the 150 Centomila.

There was the &quot;big brother&quot; of the Centauro which was called the Trasporto Tevere (TT) with the load capacity increased from 350 to 520 kg. The engine was a 235 cc four-stroke with 10 hp and a forced cooling. Further versions were the &quot;MV TTB&quot; (1961) and the &quot;MV TTC&quot; (1965).

However, the real car appeared in the MV Agusta&#x27;s range in 1956. The 1100 / D2 model was powered by a 1,079 cc twin-cylinder diesel with a four-speed gearbox. Producing 27 hp, it was able to carry a ton. It was offered as a pick-up truck, a delivery van and a pure chassis. The latest modification was the 1101 / D2L with a load capacity of 1200 kg.

MV Agusta also created a single-passenger hovercraft with a 300 cc two-stroke twin (1959), a compact tractor 185 Trattore (1962) and a tracked articulated, all-terrain carrier created by request of  the Italian Ministry of Defense (1969).

==== 1971–1980: Loss of the guiding force ====

With the death of Count Domenico Agusta in 1971, the company lost its guiding force. The company won their last Grand Prix in 1976 and by the end of the season they were out of racing.
The company&#x27;s precarious economic position forced MV Agusta to seek out a new financial partner. A solution was found in the form of public financing giant EFIM (&quot;Ente Partecipazioni e Finanziamento Industria Manifatturiera&quot;), which demanded that MV Agusta exit the motorcycle industry if were to have any chance of straightening its finances. However, they continued to sell bikes until 1980, when the last machine in the Cascina Costa warehouses was bought up.

=== 1991–2004: The revival. Age of Cagiva ===
The MV Agusta brand survived thanks to Castiglioni family. In 1960 Italian industrial entrepreneur Giovanni Castiglioni founded a metal fittings plant to produce buttons and rivets for jeans, locks and loops for suitcases, and similar fittings. This business was successful and soon two of Giovanni&#x27;s sons – Gianfranco and Claudio – joined the company. They both had a passion for motorcycles, probably caused by the proximity of Aermacchi (the European subsidiary of AMF-Harley-Davidson since 1960) factory in Varese. At the end of 1976, when MV announced its withdrawal from motorcycle racing, Castiglioni brothers tried to buy the MV racing team, but Corrado Agusta did not approve the deal. Then Castiglioni bought a Suzuki RG500, painted it in traditional MV Agusta colours – red and silver – and provided it to the racers Gianfranco Bonera and Marco Lucchinelli in the 1978 racing season. In the same year, they bought the Aermacchi factory in Varese and renaming it Cagiva (CAstiglioni + GIovanni + VArese). Brothers were focused on more on racing rather than on serial production and they launched the new project Cagiva GP500 led by Ezio Mascheroni, former head of the AMF-Harley-Davidson racing division.

Soon Cagiva became the largest Italian motorcycle manufacturer with annual production of 40,000 units. Things move slowly in Italy and, in the spring of 1992, the Castiglioni family finally managed to acquire MV Agusta. At the time, the Castiglionis owned Cagiva, Ducati, Moto Morini and Husqvarna, and operated out of the old Harley-Davidson Aermacchi premises at Schiranna on the shores of Lake Varese.

Massimo Tamburini ran Cagiva&#x27;s design department, CRC (that time this abbreviation stood for &quot;Cagiva Research Centre&quot;), in San Marino. Tamburini came to Cagiva from Bimota (the ‘Ta’ in Bimota), and by late 1992 was in the final stages of finishing the Ducati 916. But after the 916 was finished, Tamburini was ill with a stomach tumour and it wasn&#x27;t until 1995 that he could embark on the next production bike project: the four-cylinder F4.

The first prototype was completed on the eve of the 1997 Trade Fair in Milan and exhibited to the press for the first time on September 16 of that year. But this presentation became a big surprise because this bike bore the MV Agusta logo.

The genesis for a new four-cylinder motorcycle went back to September, 1989 when Claudio Castiglioni and Tamburini discussed creating a high-performance 750cc four-cylinder all-Italian motorcycle.

As CRC was heavily involved in Cagiva&#x27;s 500cc Grand Prix racing program, resources to develop the F4 were limited so Ferrari Engineering in Modena was engaged to develop the prototype. The four-cylinder engine was initially similar to half a Ferrari V8. The choice of radial valves was also Ferrari Formula 1-inspired.

Engine development was problematic and in 1991 the F4 project was moved to the Ducati factory at Borgo Panigale in Bologna. Here two of Ducati&#x27;s most eminent engineers, Massimo Bordi and Fabio Taglioni were engaged to help facilitate development.

By 1994 the Cagiva Group was under considerable financial pressure and, at the end of the year, the Cagiva Racing Department closed. Department head Riccardo Rosa then assumed control of the F4 project, which moved back to Schrianna. Andrea Goggi, an engineer with Cagiva since 1988, was entrusted with redesigning the engine.

Massimo Tamburini was given the task of finalising the chassis and styling. By now it was decided the F4 would be an MV Agusta and Tamburini was given a blank sheet of paper with the freedom to design what he wanted. When Cagiva sold Ducati to the Texas Pacific Group in 1996, Tamburini elected to stay with Cagiva, citing as his reason, &quot;Cagiva is my family&quot;.

The F4 was equipped with an inline four cylinder 749.5 cc engine with radial valves. It produced 126 hp at 12,500 rpm and 72 Nm at 10,500 rpm. The maximum speed was 275 km/h. But probably the most unique feature was the design: the F4 was even exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum in New York during the Art of the Motorcycle exhibition from June 26 to September 20, 1998. The exhibit list included 95 of the most outstanding motorcycles of all ages. And four of them are MV Agusta brands. The fifties and sixties of the 20th century were represented by two grand prix 500 cc prototypes of the MV Agusta (1956 and 1968 seasons), the first half of the 1970s – by the MV Agusta 750 S (1973), and the late 1990s – the MV Agusta F4 750 (1998). The success of the exhibition was so significant that the museum repeated it twice more: in its branches in Bilbao and Las Vegas.

In 1999 the Cagiva Group was restructured for strategic purposes, with MV Agusta becoming the parent company and main brand identity. Cagiva along with Husqvarna thus became MV Agusta&#x27;s subsidiaries.

The subsequent process of industrialisation was divided into two distinct stages: the first with production of a limited run of 300 F4 Serie Oro (English: Gold Series) bikes, with carbon fibre bodywork, magnesium parts and an engine with sand cast crankcases anticipating the construction of the S model, destined for a broader range of users thanks to its price, cut by half over that of the previous version.

With just minor improvements the F4 750 was in production until 2004, when it was replaced by the F4 1000. At the same time, in addition to the regular versions of the 750 cc sports bike (S, S 1 + 1, S EVO2 and S EVO3), number of special editions were also produced: 140 hp Senna in 2002 (in memory of the legendary Brazilian racer Ayrton Senna) and 146 hp SPR / SR in 2003 (with improved cylinder head, intake and exhaust). Each special edition was limited by 300 units.

=== 2004–2016: Time of changes ===
By December 2004 due to cashflow problems, Claudio Castiglioni was forced to sell a bigger part of his stake in MV Agusta (65% of the share capital) to Malaysian car maker Proton for 70 million euros. One year later Proton sold its shares to the Italian financial holding GEVI S.p.A. for 1 euro only.

In the meantime, Castiglioni obtained from the North American financier Oliver Curme, a general partner with Battery Ventures, who owned the Norton brand, license for production of a new generation of Norton motorcycles (designed by Tamburini) in Italy. However the deal was not approved by GEVI S.p.A. which proceed with another deal and sold Husqvarna to BMW Motorrad in July 2007.

Being disappointed by these decisions, Castiglioni found a new opportunity for MV Agusta: on July 11, 2008, Harley-Davidson announced they had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the MV Agusta Group for 109 million US dollars (about 70 million euros), completing the acquisition on August 8, 2008. Castiglioni remained its president. Harley-Davidson invested 40 million euros into debts pay-off, production upgrade and the new model launches – a completely new three-cylinder F3 designed by the Ezio Mascheroni (who developed also Cagiva GP500 in the past).

However, due to its own problems Harley-Davidson decided to sell MV Agusta in October 2009. On August 6, 2010, Castiglioni family repurchased the new MV Agusta company, financially healthy and seriously refreshed, for just 1 euro. At EICMA 2010, MV Agusta unveiled the next generation of the extreme F4 sports bike with the new Corsa Corta engine with a capacity of 998 cc and 201 hp. It was the first new four-cylinder engine MV Agusta since 2005. At the same time, the Brutale naked line was updated, getting new model names 990 R (998 cc, 139 hp) and 1090 R (1078 cc, 142 hp). As a result, sales were increased for 50% in Q1 2010 and by the end of the year they achieved 3650 units.

However, on August 17, 2011, after a long illness at the age of 64, Claudio Castiglioni died. Giovanni Castiglioni, the son of Claudio, became the head of the company, and Massimo Bordi, who returned to the motorcycle industry, became vice-president. 

&quot;F3 is our future,&quot; – Claudio Castiglioni said at the presentation of the three-cylinder F3 model – in fact, he shared the company strategy for the coming years. Production of the &quot;supersport&quot; F3 675 and its naked version Brutale 675 began at the Varese factory in 2012. A year later they were supplemented by 798 cc F3 800 and also by Rivale 800 hypermotard. Then the range of three-cylinder models was expanded with Brutale 800 and the Brutale 800 Dragster, as well as the Turismo Veloce 800 and Stradale 800 sport tourers.

During the next years MV Agusta demonstrated significant sales growth: 3,687 units in 2011 (+1% vs prior year), 6557 in 2012 (+70%), 7488 in 2013 (+14%), 9200 in 2014 (+23%). However the company was not able to manage such explosive growth situation from processes and financials side and finally MV Agusta increased its debt again. In addition to this MV experienced its traditional problems with dealer network and spare parts delivery. Therefore, the announced partnership with Mercedes-AMG looked like a good deal for MV Agusta .

The motivation of Mercedes-AMG acquisition of 25% of MV (rumored for 30 millions euros of injections into the company plus support in sales &amp; marketing operations) remains unclear. But this followed similar acquisition strategy by rival Ducati, now in partnership with Audi. Anyway this deal helped MV Agusta with getting back lenders&#x27; confidence and in February 2015, Banca Popolare di Milano (BPM) with the guarantees of the Italian export credit agency SACE loaned to MV Agusta 15 million euros to implement a new business plan. In addition, suppliers opened a new €25 million credit line for MV.

According to the press Giovani Castiglioni expected more investments from Mercedes-AMG which didn&#x27;t hurry with it. To the beginning of 2016, Mercedes-AMG became ready to sell non-core asset with debts of over 40 million euros. However, taking into account the clause in the loan agreement with BPM that allows the bank to demand early repayment of debt, if Mercedes-AMG participation in the authorized capital of MV Agusta falls below 20%, the situation became difficult. Due to debts grow, suppliers began to refuse massively shipments of the components. Finally MV Agusta was forced to call for a judge protection to avoid bankruptcy.

In March 2016, municipal court of Varese approved the protective act &quot;&quot;Concordato di continuità&quot; (English: sequence agreement), putting a moratorium on creditors&#x27; requirements for the period of a new investor search. MV Agusta from its side was obliged to reduce production from 9,000 motorcycles per year to 6,000-7,000, to reduce R&amp;D costs from 15 million euros to 7 million, to reduce expenses for the racing division Reparto Corse from 4 million euros to 600 thousand. In addition MV had to fire at least 200 employees. This was followed in early April by reports that MV was negotiating the repurchase of AMG&#x27;s 25% stake in the company and looking for a new major investor, whilst retaining the majority shareholding of the Castiglioni family. Even of greater concern, were reports that MV were not delivering any spare parts and that the factory might have ceased production. However, the final debt restructuring plan was approved by the court only in December 2017 when a new investor came.

===Since 2017===

In November 2016, Giovanni Castiglioni and the UK-Russian fund COMSAR Invest (part of the Black Ocean Group, managed by the Sardarov family) agreed to conclude an investment agreement. The new debt restructuring plan for MV Agusta Motor S.p.A. was approved by the court in March 2017. At the same time the protective act &quot;Concordato di continuità&quot;&quot; (English: sequence agreement) was extended. To the mid of 2017 Black Ocean Group acquired 49% of the shares of MV Agusta Holding (parent company of MV Agusta Motor S.p.A.) and Giovanni Castiglioni kept 51%.

Mercedes-AMG received payment from the parties for its 25%  in November 2017.

In March 2018, Giovanni Castiglioni, the CEO of MV Agusta, announced that the company was working on three new motorcycles based on a new 1,000 cc engine. The bikes consisted of a naked roadster, a café style roadster, and a replacement of the F4 superbike that will cease production in December 2018. The F4 replacement could be electric/gas hybrid, reportedly making more than 300 horsepower, and potentially would not be ready for production until 2021.

At the EICMA 2018 MV Agusta announced the a new family of 1,000 cc in-line &quot;fours&quot; created by MV technical director Brian Gillen and chief designer Adrian Morton. Brutale 1000 Serie Oro with 208 hp (or 212 hp with full exhaust system) and 115 Nm allowed to achieve a maximum of 312 km/h, was introduced as the world&#x27;s most powerful and fastest naked bike. It was also won a title of  the most beautiful bike of EICMA 2018 (35% of visitors&#x27; votes ahead of 19% for Ducati Hypermotard SP and 9% for Aprilia RSV4 1100 Factory).

At EICMA 2018 MV Agusta also introduced two new models. The first was the world&#x27;s first neo-classic racer Superveloce 800 Serie Oro, built on the platform of the F3 800 (148 hp) with the design inspired by Italian sports cars of the 1960s and 1970s. The second one was the F4 Claudio – the last and the greatest model in the F4 history that paid tribute to Claudio Castiglioni. Superveloce 800 Serie Oro was limited by 300 units and F4 Claudio – by 100 units.

At the end of 2018 MV Agusta was recapitalized by extra 40 million euros. In the same year, Timur Sardarov was appointed the CEO of MV Agusta.

In October 2019, MV presented a new five-year business plan, promising annual production growth up to 25,000 units in 5 years. Massimo Bordi, was appointed deputy general director, and Paolo Bettin was appointed financial director. Former president of the company Giovanni Castiglioni kept the role of a consultant.

In 2020 MV Agusta produced the MV Agusta Superveloce, a retro racer styled motorcycle based on the F3 800 Supersport. It is described by MV Agusta as &quot;a modern interpretation of the iconic stylistic concept of the MV Agusta. A fusion of vintage and contemporary ensures that the future incorporates the memories of good times gone by&quot;

In November 2022, Pierer Mobility (KTM) acquired a 25.1% minority stake in MV Agusta by way of a capital increase. Pierer Mobility, will provide MV Agusta with supply chain support, take over of purchasing and global sales activities. In March 2024, the stake was increased to 50,1%. 

In January 2025, with the financial crisis of Pierer Mobility (KTM), MV Agusta returns under the full control of the Sardarov Family.

==Racing history==
=== Race wins (1948–1976) ===
The name of MV Agusta became popular in 1948 when Franco Bertoni won the 125 cc in the Italian Grand Prix. By that time MV Agusta adopted the commercial slogan: &quot;Racing experience at the service of mass production&quot;.

The manufacturer won its first world championship in with Cecil Sandford in the 125 cc class. Starting a domination in all classes, MV Agusta won the 125 cc, 250 cc, 350 cc and 500 cc titles simultaneously in , and . The Italian manufacturer made an impressive streak conquering all 500 cc class riders&#x27; championships between 1958 and 1974.

MV Agusta retired from Grand Prix racing at the end of the season, having won 270 Grand Prix motorcycle races, 38 World Riders&#x27; Championships and 37 World Constructors&#x27; Championships with legendary riders such as Giacomo Agostini, Mike Hailwood, Phil Read, Carlo Ubbiali, Gary Hocking and John Surtees.

MV Agusta won the Tourist Trophy 34 times.

=== Return to racing ===
Although there were no factory racing efforts, independent (&quot;privateer&quot;) teams were racing the F4 750. In 2003 Big Show Racing of Chicago, Illinois, USA, fielded an F4 750 in the Formula USA, Daytona International Speedway 200 Mile Team Challenge. The team placed second overall with riders Larry Denning and Aaron Risinger piloting the bike.

In 2004 the company made a semi-official return to racing, backing the &quot;MV Agusta Deutschland&quot; team in the IDM German Superbike championship: Jörg Teuchert claimed two wins riding a F4 1000S, marking the company&#x27;s return to a victory since Agostini&#x27;s 1976 German Grand Prix win.
In 2005 the racing activities were expanded to the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup with Italian teams &quot;EVR Corse&quot; and &quot;Gimotorsports&quot;.

MV Agusta won the Italian Superstock Championship in 2006 with Luca Scassa, 30 years after its last title (Agostini&#x27;s 1976 500cc Italian Championship). In 2008 Scassa won the Italian Superbike Championship on a factory-backed machine from the racing department in Schiranna, Varese Italy.

Team Fast by Ferracci entered two F4s for Luca Scassa and Matt Lynn in the 2007 AMA Superbike Championship season.

The company planned its return to racing for the 2008 Superbike World Championship season: Carl Fogarty&#x27;s English-based Team Foggy Racing was going to run the team; However the project was aborted due to a lack of sponsorship.

In 2013 two MV Agusta F4-RR were entered by Grant Racing in the British Superstock Championship.
The MV Agusta F3 675 competed in the 2013 Supersport World Championship season with two bikes managed by Team ParkinGO; Roberto Rolfo and Christian Iddon rode the bikes achieving three podiums.

In 2014 MV Agusta made the official return to racing establishing the MV Agusta Reparto Corse works team, managing both World Superbike and Supersport activities.

In 2018 it was announced that MV Agusta would return to Grand Prix racing as well with Forward Racing in Moto2. The new bike will begin testing in July for a return to racing in the 2019 season. It will be the first time since 1976 that MV Agusta will have an entry on the grand prix entry list when it dropped out due to financial difficulties.
In November 2018, Stefano Manzi and Dominique Aegerter were announced as the team&#x27;s two riders in the manufacturer&#x27;s return to Grand Prix racing.

The new bike also features a new engine package built for it. The aging Honda CBR600RR inline-4 engine – which had been used since the inaugural Moto2 season back in 2010 – was replaced by a 765 cc (46.7 cu in) triple cylinder engine developed by Triumph Motorcycles based on the Street Triple RS 765.

<text>The Liberal Party of Kosovo () is a liberal political party in the Republic of Kosovo.

The party is an observer member of the Liberal International and a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party.

In the 2004 parliamentary election, the party won 0.5% of the popular vote and 1 out of 190 seats in the Assembly of Kosovo. However, in the 2007 parliamentary election, it failed to pass the election threshold of 5%, thus becoming a non-parliamentary party. Like all other Kosovo Albanian political parties, the party supports Kosovo independence and does not take part in the general elections in Serbia nor any other election or referendum organised by the Serbian parliament. The current president of the Liberal Party of Kosovo is Gjergj Dedaj.

<text>Q-Chem is a general-purpose electronic structure package featuring a variety of established and new methods implemented using innovative algorithms that enable fast calculations of large systems on various computer architectures, from laptops and regular lab workstations to midsize clusters, HPCC, and cloud computing using density functional and wave-function based approaches. It offers an integrated graphical interface and input generator; a large selection of functionals and correlation methods, including methods for electronically excited states and open-shell systems; solvation models; and wave-function analysis tools. In addition to serving the computational chemistry community, Q-Chem also provides a versatile code development platform.

==History==

Q-Chem software is maintained and distributed by Q-Chem, Inc., located in Pleasanton, California, USA. It was founded in 1993 as a result of disagreements within the Gaussian company that led to the departure (and subsequent &quot;banning&quot;) of John Pople and a number of his students and postdocs (see Gaussian License Controversy).

The first lines of the Q-Chem code were written by Peter Gill, at that time a postdoc of Pople, during a winter vacation (December 1992) in Australia. Gill was soon joined by Benny Johnson (a Pople graduate student) and Carlos Gonzalez (another Pople postdoc), but the latter left the company shortly thereafter. In mid-1993, Martin Head-Gordon, formerly a Pople student, but at that time on the Berkeley tenure track, joined the growing team of academic developers.

In preparation for the first commercial release, the company hired Eugene Fleischmann as marketing director and acquired its URL www.q-chem.com in January 1997. The first commercial product, Q-Chem 1.0, was released in March 1997. Advertising postcards celebrated the release with the proud headline, &quot;Problems which were once impossible are now routine&quot;; however, version 1.0 had many shortcomings, and a wit once remarked that the words &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;routine&quot; should probably be interchanged! However, vigorous code development continued, and by the following year Q-Chem 1.1 was able to offer most of the basic quantum chemical functionality as well as a growing list of features (the continuous fast multipole method, J-matrix engine, COLD PRISM for integrals, and G96 density functional, for example) that were not available in any other package.

Following a setback when Johnson left, the company became more decentralized, establishing and cultivating relationships with an ever-increasing circle of research groups in universities around the world. In 1998, Fritz Schaefer accepted an invitation to join the Board of Directors and, early in 1999, as soon as his non-compete agreement with Gaussian had expired, John Pople joined as both a Director and code developer.

In 2000, Q-Chem established a collaboration with Wavefunction Inc., which led to the incorporation of Q-Chem as the ab initio engine in all subsequent versions of the Spartan package. The Q-Chem Board was expanded in March 2003 with the addition of Anna Krylov and Jing Kong. In 2012, John Herbert joined the Board and Fritz Schaefer became a Member Emeritus. The following year, Shirin Faraji joined the Board; Peter Gill, who had been President of Q-Chem since 1988, stepped down; and Anna Krylov became the new president. 
In 2022-23 Yuezhi Mao and Joonho Lee joined the board.
The active Board of Directors currently consists of Lee, Mao, Faraji, Gill (past-President), Herbert, Krylov (President), and Hilary Pople (John&#x27;s daughter). Martin Head-Gordon remains a Scientific Advisor to the Board.

Currently, there are thousands of Q-Chem licenses in use, and Q-Chem&#x27;s user base is expanding, as illustrated by citation records for releases 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0, which reached 400 per year in 2016 (see Figure 2). Q-Chem has been used as an engine in high-throughput studies, such as the Harvard Clean Energy Project, in which about 350,000 calculations were performed daily on the IBM World Community Grid.

Innovative algorithms and new approaches to electronic structure have been enabling cutting-edge scientific discoveries. This transition, from in-house code to major electronic structure engine, has become possible due to contributions from numerous scientific collaborators; the Q-Chem business model encourages broad developer participation. Q-Chem defines its genre as open-teamware: its source code is open to a large group of developers. In addition, some Q-Chem modules are distributed as open source. Since 1992, over 400 man- (and woman-) years have been devoted to code development. Q-Chem 5.2.2, released in December 2019, consists of 7.5 million lines of code, which includes contributions by more than 300 active developers (current estimate is 312). See Figure 3.

==Features==
Q-Chem can perform a number of general quantum chemistry calculations, such as Hartree–Fock, density functional theory (DFT) including time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), coupled cluster (CC), equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), configuration interaction (CI), algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC), and other advanced electronic structure methods. Q-Chem also includes QM/MM functionality. Q-Chem 4.0 and higher releases come with the graphical user interface, IQMol, which includes a hierarchical input generator, a molecular builder, and general visualization capabilities (MOs, densities, molecular vibrations, reaction pathways, etc.). IQMol is developed by Andrew Gilbert (in coordination with Q-Chem) and is distributed as free open-source software. IQmol is written using the Qt libraries, enabling it to run on a range of platforms, including OS X, Widows, and Linux. It provides an intuitive environment to set up, run, and analyze Q-Chem calculations. It can also read and display a variety of file formats, including the widely available formatted checkpoint format. A complete, up-to-date list of features is published on the Q-Chem website and in the user manual.

In addition, Q-Chem is interfaced with WebMO and is used as the computing engine in Spartan, or as a back-end to CHARMM, GROMACS, NAMD, and ChemShell. Other popular visualization programs such as Jmol and Molden can also be used.

In 2018, Q-Chem established a partnership with BrianQC, produced by StreamNovation, Ltd., a new integral engine exploiting the computational power of GPUs. The BrianQC plug-in speeds up Q-Chem calculations by taking advantage of GPUs on mixed architectures, which is highly efficient for simulating large molecules and extended systems. BrianQC is the first GPU Quantum Chemistry software capable of calculating high angular momentum orbitals.

<text>The Battle of Caldiero took place on 30 October 1805, pitting the French &quot;Armée d&#x27;Italie&quot; under Marshal André Masséna against an Austrian army under the command of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. The French engaged only some of their forces, around 33,000 men, but Archduke Charles engaged the bulk of his army, 49,000 men, leaving out Paul Davidovich&#x27;s corps to defend the lower Adige and Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg&#x27;s corps to cover the Austrian right against any flanking maneuvers. The fighting took place at Caldiero, 15 kilometres east of Verona, during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Preliminaries==

By mid October, Marshal André Masséna, a seasoned French general, who had fought the Austrians in Lombardia before during the campaign of 1796–1797, was waiting for developments on the main theatre of operations in Bavaria. On 18 October, Masséna won a bridgehead on the east bank of the Adige River in the Battle of Verona. At dawn, the French launched their attack from Verona against Josef Philipp Vukassovich&#x27;s division. After heavy fighting, the divisions of Guillaume Philibert Duhesme and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne cleared the town of San Giorgio and part of the heights of Veronetta. The French lost 77 dead and 246 wounded, while the Austrians suffered 246 killed and 906 wounded. Archduke Charles was so unhappy with Vukassovich&#x27;s performance that he replaced him with Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg.

News that Emperor Napoleon I demolished the main Austrian army in the Ulm Campaign finally reached Masséna on 28 October and he issued orders for an immediate offensive against the Austrian army in northern Italy. Crossing the Adige river with the divisions of Duhesme, Gardanne, and Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor and leaving behind Jean Mathieu Seras&#x27; division to cover Verona, Masséna planned to move forward into Austrian-controlled territory.

The fighting on 29 October is considered by one historian to be part of the Battle of Caldiero. On that day, the divisions of Duhesme and Gardanne advanced on the left against Rosenberg, while Molitor&#x27;s and Louis Partouneaux&#x27;s divisions moved forward against the town of Veronetta. Seeing a mass of French troops approaching, the Austrians abandoned Veronetta and fell back to San Michele. The French mauled Rosenberg&#x27;s division and forced Johann Maria Philipp Frimont out of San Michele after street fighting. By the end of the day, Masséna&#x27;s troops closed up to the main defense line of Archduke Charles. The French counted losses of 527 killed and wounded, plus 157 captured. Again, Austrian casualties were heavier, numbering 1,926 killed and wounded, with 1,114 prisoners.

Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen, himself acutely aware of the dire consequences of the fall of Ulm, was planning to move towards Vienna, in order to reinforce the remains of the Austrian army and link up with the Russians. However, in order to avoid having Masséna&#x27;s men on his heels, he decided to suddenly turn and face the French, hoping that by defeating them he would ensure the success of his march towards inner Austria.

==Battle plans==
Archduke Charles had already made preparations for a French attack, occupying the strategic village of Caldiero, through which passed the main Lombardian road (&#x27;the Verona road&#x27;) and deploying no less than 58 cannons and 24 mortars. The Austrian forces were divided into three main groups: to the right, Joseph Anton von Simbschen occupied the heights of Colognola and the ravine of San Zeno, where his cavalry was massed; in the centre, General Count Heinrich von Bellegarde covered the Verona road, holding the entrenchments north of the road as well as Monte Rocca and Ponterotta, to the south of the road; the left was formed by Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen&#x27;s forces, which extended the Austrian line to Chiavighette and had the detached division of General Joseph Armand von Nordmann cover the Adige in front of Chiavica del Christo.

Upon reconnoitering the Austrian position, Masséna drew up his plan. General Gardanne was to form the apex of the army, deploying his forces on both sides of the Verona road, supported by Partouneaux&#x27;s reserve, Jean Louis Brigitte Espagne&#x27;s cavalry and a part of Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet&#x27;s dragoons. To the left Molitor&#x27;s division would deploy close to Ca dell&#x27;Ara and would set out to take the heights of Colognola. To the right, Duhesme would march on Gombione in order to fall upon Caldiero, but he was ordered to make his move towards midday. Finally Jean-Antoine Verdier would cross the Adige at Perzacco and turn the enemy left, with the support of Charles Joseph de Pully&#x27;s cavalry while the rest of Mermet&#x27;s cavalry would ensure contact with Verdier.

==Battle==

Masséna was planning to wait for Verdier&#x27;s flanking maneuver before committing to a frontal attack, but Archduke Charles took the initiative, attacking on both flanks of the French army. Taking with him the cavalry he had available, Simbschen made the first move against Molitor, descending the slope of the Colognola heights and approaching Ca dell&#x27;Ara. On the other side of the battlefield, Nordmann moved forward too, following the river line of the Adige. Molitor moved forward himself and his forces clashed with Simbschen&#x27;s, forcing the latter back up the slopes of the Colognola Alta. Just as the French were coming up the slope in order to assault that position, the Austrians were reinforced by troops sent by Bellegarde and thus could repulse the French attack, pushing them into the ravine. A second French assault would also fail and the fighting would continue throughout much of the day, with the Austrians remaining masters of the heights.

In the centre, general Gardanne belatedly formed his men and painstakingly fought his way up towards Caldiero against a determined Bellegarde. Gardanne&#x27;s first attempt failed and he was forced to fall back on Rotta, where he was immediately reinforced by Partounneaux and d&#x27;Espagne. With his force thus augmented, Gardanne moved forward again and this time the French managed to take the vital position of Caldiero. A furious Austrian counterattack regained the position only to see Gardanne receive further reinforcements, one of Duhesme&#x27;s brigades, which helped retake Caldiero. Bellegarde reformed his men for another counterattack, which he led in cooperation with Reuss-Plauen&#x27;s forces, which had just come up as reinforcements. It took a considerable effort from the combined forces of Bellegarde and Reuss-Plauen to drive the French out of Caldiero, but Gardanne sounded the charge and regained control of the village after fierce hand-to-hand combat. The Austrians finally evacuated the position and the exhausted French drove them out and then fell back to the relative safety of the village.

On the French right, general Duhesme moved early against the forces of prince Reuss-Plauen and moved his first brigade under François Goullus against the Austrians at Gombione. However, Duhesme saw the situation on his left rapidly deteriorating and was thus forced to send Mathieu Herbin&#x27;s brigade in support of Gardanne&#x27;s assault of Caldiero. While Herbin&#x27;s brigade would be in the thick of the fighting until nightfall, Goullus&#x27; would spend the day covering the position at Gombione.

To the extreme right, Verdier was operating the flanking maneuver as ordered, when he learned that Davidovich had crossed the Adige at Bonavigo and was on the right bank with a part of his troops. Verdier promptly abandoned his initial plan of crossing at Perzacco and instead decided to cross the river right away at Zevio. However, instead of striking at the back of Nordmann&#x27;s force, as he had hoped Verdier found himself facing the bulk of Nordmann&#x27;s troops, which soon forced the French back across the river.

As night fell, combat ceased, with the Austrians already disengaged in most sectors of the battlefield. Archduke Charles decided against renewing battle the next day and began pulling out during the night.

==Casualties==
Both sides took heavy casualties, with the French losing only slightly fewer men than the Austrians, around 3,700 to 4,200. The French also lost colonel Julliac de Manelle of the 2nd Foot Artillery Regiment, who was mortally wounded during the battle. Some vicious fighting involved the French 5th Line Infantry Regiment, which almost lost two of its eagles. A second source gives Austrian losses as 5,700 and notes that Charles claimed to have inflicted 8,000 casualties on the French. A third source puts Austrian losses higher than 5,500 and says that the French under-reported their casualties as 2,000 when they must have been at least 5,000.

On 30 October, as a result of the defeat at Caldiero, the Austrians also lost a further 5,000 men and 70 officers (among which there were three superior officers) with their weapons and effects. These men were stationed at Cara Albertini under the command of General Hillinger and were forced to surrender. Although the French had agreed to release the prisoners, the 5,000 men would not be released. Two authorities put Hillinger&#x27;s disaster on 2 November and gave Austrian losses as 400 killed and wounded and 1,800 captured. Another source gives no casualties or date for the action but wrote that Hillinger was &quot;annihilated&quot;.

==Strategic aftermath==

Archduke Charles began his retreat on the morning of 1 November, leaving a rearguard under Frimont to delay the French. Frimont&#x27;s mixed brigade, consisting of four battalions and 12 squadrons, was only lightly engaged in the battle. Reinforced by infantry and an additional cavalry regiment, the rear guard put up a lively fight when pressed by d&#x27;Espagne&#x27;s cavalry and the 22nd Light Infantry Regiment.

Bellegarde, Rosenberg, and Reuss fell back to Vicenza while Davidovich&#x27;s corps withdrew to Padua. Hoping to create trouble in Massena&#x27;s rear, Charles ordered Davidiovich to reinforce the Venice garrison with 12 battalions. Unknown to Charles, Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr&#x27;s 8,700-man Italian division was marching northeast from central Italy. When it arrived near Venice, Saint-Cyr had sufficient strength to blockade the port and prevent the Austrian garrison from harassing Massena&#x27;s communications.

Archduke Charles steadily retreated, fighting a rear guard action at San Pietro in Gu near the Brenta River on 4 November in which one battalion of the &quot;Kreutzer&quot; Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 5 was destroyed by Molitor&#x27;s division. Another clash occurred at Valvasone, east of the Tagliamento River on 11 November, where Charles fended off the French pursuit. During the withdrawal, d&#x27;Espagne trailed the Austrians with his own light cavalry division, Antoine Digonet&#x27;s brigade of Verdier&#x27;s division, Seras&#x27; infantry division, and Pully&#x27;s cuirassiers. D&#x27;Espagne managed the pursuit effectively, making Charles believe that he was being closely followed. In fact, Masséna&#x27;s main body was a three-day march behind the Austrians. Charles crossed the Isonzo River on 13 November. Karl von Vincent held off Molitor&#x27;s attempt to cross the Isonzo River at Gradisca d&#x27;Isonzo on 16 November.

At the beginning of the war, Archduke John of Austria was assigned to command the army in the Tyrol and the Vorarlberg. He was directed to detach forces under Franz Jellacic and Franz Xaver von Auffenberg to the Danube army. Auffenberg&#x27;s division was mauled at the Battle of Wertingen and later surrendered at the Battle of Ulm. Jellacic was required to guard the south flank of the Danube army near Lake Constance. Marshal Pierre Augereau&#x27;s VII Corps ran him to earth in the Vorarlberg. Jellacic surrendered with his infantry on 14 November in the Capitulation of Dornbirn, his cavalry having gotten away. Another brigade of the Tyrol army under Prince Louis Victor Rohan-Guéméné became separated in the retreat and slipped away to the south where it made a dash for Venice. On 24 November Rohan&#x27;s 4,400 troops were caught between the divisions of Jean Reynier and Saint-Cyr at the Battle of Castelfranco Veneto and forced to surrender. John managed to escape to the east with about 20,000 soldiers and fought a successful rear guard action against Nicolas Bernard Guiot de Lacour&#x27;s dragoons near the upper Isonzo at Bovec on 19 November 1805.

Charles hoped to march northeast to Villach for an early junction with his brother, Archduke John. However, he heard that some of Napoleon&#x27;s troops were moving in his direction from the Danube valley. Marshal Michel Ney&#x27;s VI Corps was repulsed at Scharnitz on 4 November with 800 casualties. However, that day, another brigade broke through a pass farther west at Leutasch, capturing about 600 Austrian line infantry. At Weyer on 7 November, Auguste Marmont&#x27;s II Corps overtook and captured two battalions belonging to Maximilian, Count of Merveldt&#x27;s corps. Farther east on the following day, Louis Davout&#x27;s III Corps advance guard crushed Merveldt&#x27;s column at the Battle of Mariazell. Ney occupied Innsbruck on 7 November and Marmont was heading for Leoben in Styria. Armed with this new information, Charles instead directed his troops&#x27; march on a more easterly path toward Ljubljana (Laibach). Massena suspended his pursuit of Charles on 16 November.

Archdukes Charles and John joined forces near Maribor (Marburg an der Drau) on 26 November. Though he now had an army numbering 85,000, Charles elected not to make a thrust at Vienna by attacking Marmont. Instead, he &quot;moved rather slowly&quot; according to historian Gunther E. Rothenberg. Charles pitched camp on the Mur River until 2 December when he withdrew into Hungary. By the time he reached Körmend on 6 December, the Battle of Austerlitz had been fought, ending in a decisive French victory.

Even after his great victory, Emperor Napoleon considered Archduke Charles&#x27; large army a threat. Accordingly, he directed Massena to reorganize his army as the VIII Corps, sweep east, and send Mermet&#x27;s and Pully&#x27;s heavy cavalry to Graz. Marmont massed at Graz with the II Corps while Ney reached Klagenfurt with his VI Corps. Napoleon stationed Marshal Davout&#x27;s III Corps at Bratislava (Pressburg) and Marshal Nicolas Soult&#x27;s IV Corps south of Vienna. Charles&#x27; army was completely boxed in. On 26 December, the Treaty of Pressburg was signed, ending the conflict.

==Commentary==

The battle was a significant strategic victory for the French as it allowed them to closely follow and continually harass the Austrian army as it fell back towards inner Austria. Masséna thus delayed Charles, preventing him from joining the army of the Danube and directly influencing the main theatre of the war.

Historians disagree on whether Caldiero was a French tactical victory, an Austrian tactical victory or a draw. Alain Pigeard, whose work is a major source for this article, rated the engagement as a French victory. Digby Smith called the battle a &quot;drawn match&quot;, but Frederick C. Schneid called it &quot;indecisive&quot;. Gunther E. Rothenberg wrote that Caldiero was &quot;Austria&#x27;s solitary military success in this war&quot;, but he was aware that the French historian Adolphe Thiers had considered the battle to be a French victory.

Napoleon was more critical of Andre Masséna: ‘(He) has behaved indifferently. He made bad dispositions and got himself beaten at Caldiero’.

<text>The Singapore Democratic Party (abbreviation: SDP) is a social liberal political party in Singapore. Having peaked at three seats after the 1991 general election, the party currently has no seats in Parliament since 1997.

It was founded in 1980 by Chiam See Tong, who as Secretary-General became the party&#x27;s first Member of Parliament (MP) in 1984 when he was elected in the constituency of Potong Pasir. At the 1991 General Election, SDP members Ling How Doong and Cheo Chai Chen won their seats at Bukit Gombak and Nee Soon respectively, giving the party a total of three MPs. However, Chiam fell out with the party&#x27;s Central Executive Committee in 1993 and subsequently left the party in 1996 for the splinter Singapore People&#x27;s Party (SPP), destabilising the party. He was succeeded by Chee Soon Juan, who has remained the Secretary-General ever since.

A centrist to centre-left political party, the SDP ideologically draw upon both liberalism and social democracy. The party has been led by different factions at various points, with Chiam and Chee&#x27;s respective leaderships characterised by very divergent party objectives. Members of the party have its own ideological bent, many of which leaning towards the centre-left and others the centre and some even the centre-right. Since the 2000s, the party has since focused more on a liberal human rights agenda. 

The party has called for a few reforms to the Constitution. Among others, it emphasises stronger protections for civil liberties and promotes social liberal approaches to issues as well as changes to education, healthcare and housing policies. It also favours more social welfare spending for Singaporeans and decreasing the rates of immigration. The party is both a member of Liberal International and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats.

==History==
===Founding===
The SDP was founded on 6 August 1980 by lawyer Chiam See Tong, who had contested several elections as an independent candidate in the 1970s, together with consultant engineer Fok Tai Loy and businessman Ernest Chew Tian Ern, who they took the roles of the party&#x27;s founding Secretary-General, Chairman, and Assistant Secretary-General, respectively. The main objectives of the party were declared to be the &quot;elimination of colonialism and feudalism, the safeguarding of parliamentary democracy and upholding of the principles of democracy, socialism and the constitution.&quot; Two months later, on 19 October 1980, the party unveiled its emblem: a circle (which symbolises unity amongst Singapore&#x27;s ethnic groups), behind an arrow (representing political progress in Singapore) in the colour red (signifying courage and determination). The party was inaugurated on 21 September 1981, a full year after being registered as a political party.

== Leadership Transition and Party Evolution in 1993 ==
In 1993, internal conflicts within the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) came to a head. Tensions had been brewing between Chiam See Tong, the party&#x27;s Secretary-General, and other members of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) since before Chee Soon Juan joined the party. These disputes, which included disagreements over leadership style and party direction, were exacerbated by Chiam&#x27;s attempt to censure Chee following a hunger strike. When the CEC did not support this censure, Chiam resigned from his position as Secretary-General.

Despite Chiam&#x27;s resignation, the CEC made efforts to persuade him to return. Chiam, however, demanded conditions deemed undemocratic by the CEC, such as sole power to appoint and dismiss CEC and cadre members, and the removal of Vice-Chairman Wong Hong Toy. These demands were against the party&#x27;s democratic principles and constitution, leading to an impasse.

Chiam later criticized the CEC publicly, prompting a disciplinary hearing. Although the CEC initially did not intend to expel him, the decision was made after a lengthy debate, with 11 out of 13 members voting for expulsion. The CEC continued attempts at reconciliation even after the decision was made, but these were unsuccessful. 

Following these events, supporters of Chiam left the SDP and formed the Singapore People&#x27;s Party (SPP) in 1994, with Sin Kek Tong as its pro-tem leader. Chiam joined the SPP ahead of the 1997 general election, becoming its leader and continuing his political career under a new banner.

This period marked a significant turning point for the SDP, highlighting both the challenges of internal party dynamics and the commitment to maintaining democratic principles within the party structure.

==Organization and structure==
The SDP is governed by a twelve-member Central Executive Committee (CEC), who are elected by the party&#x27;s cadre members at the Ordinary Party Conference held biennially.

=== Central Executive Committee Line-up (2024-2026) ===
On 3 February 2024, the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) announced the election of its Central Executive Committee (CEC) during the 21st Ordinary Party Conference (OPC). The cadre members elected the CEC, which will serve a two-year term starting from February 2024.

Dr. Paul Tambyah, Chairperson of the SDP, commented on the new CEC line-up, stating that it comprises a balanced mix of experienced party veterans and dynamic young members, all committed to fostering a more democratic Singapore. He expressed confidence that the team would successfully manage town councils and address important issues in Parliament with innovative solutions.

Secretary-General Dr. Chee Soon Juan emphasized the importance of a unified strategy for public engagement and planning as the party prepares for the upcoming General Election, expected in the latter half of 2024. He stressed the need for effective communication and groundwork to be established in the weeks and months ahead to ensure a strong electoral campaign.

==Election Performance==

=== 1980 and 1984 general elections ===
The party entered the election campaign of that year under the slogan of &quot;Singaporeans for Singapore&quot;, raising the need for elected opposition in parliament to bring democracy to Singapore. The party also raised other prominent issues of the time such as the need to reform the education and CPF system, and its opposition to the Elected Presidency. It noticeably fielded only four candidates in that general election: Secretary-General Chiam See Tong, Chairman Ling How Doong (who was elected Chairman after the death of Fok Tai Loy), Vice-Chairman Soon Kia Seng and treasurer Peter Lim Ah Yong.

During the campaigning, the party came under fire from the ruling&#x27;s People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), with Ling and Chiam bearing the brunt of the attacks. The PAP chose to highlight Ling&#x27;s dismissal from the police force and the record of his election agent, but these were quickly rebutted by the SDP leadership. Chiam saw his secondary school record being brought up by the then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who compared Chiam&#x27;s intelligence with that of PAP&#x27;s Mah Bow Tan (a candidate who later became a cabinet minister and then-MP of Tampines GRC) who was standing against the SDP leader. Chiam won the single seat of Potong Pasir after three attempts in the constituency by a vote of 60.3% to Mah&#x27;s 39.7%, making Chiam as only the second opposition politician ever to be elected to the Republic&#x27;s Parliament after J.B. Jeyaretnam of the Workers&#x27; Party. The SDP garnered 45.2% of total votes cast in the constituencies they had contested in.

After Jeyaretnam was expelled from Parliament in 1986, Chiam was Singapore&#x27;s sole opposition MP. A moderate, Chiam claimed that he was not opposing for the sake of opposition. He also said: &quot;But if they (the government) do the wrong things which are not good for Singapore, then we will oppose fearlessly&quot;.

=== 1988 general elections ===
The 1988 general elections saw the opposition&#x27;s strongest challenge since 1963, with 71 out of 82 seats contested. This election also saw the PAP engage the SDP&#x27;s Chiam and WP&#x27;s Jeyaretnam in a television debate. Besides Chiam and Ling, the SDP also fielded Ashleigh Seow (the son of former Solicitor-General Francis Seow), businessmen Jufrie Mahmood, Cheo Chai Chen and Ng Teck Siong, sales manager Kwan Yue Keng, bank clerical assistant Mohd Shariff Yahya, teacher George Sita, financial futures trader Jimmy Tan, former PAP MP Low Yong Nguan, businesswoman Toh Kim Kiat, construction supervisor Francis Yong Chu Leong, shipping manager Chia Ah Soon and director Sin Kek Tong, the later who would found Chiam&#x27;s spin-off party of Singapore People&#x27;s Party. The party chose to target the government on the plan to amend the constitution, and that the economic prosperity indicators it used were untrue When the results were declared, it emerged that the SDP was the only opposition party to win a seat, with Chiam re-elected as Potong Pasir MP for a second term. The SDP scored 39.5% of the total votes cast in all the constituencies it had contested in.

=== 1991 general elections ===
The PAP&#x27;s announcement of a general election in 1991 came when the ruling party was barely in office for three years. The SDP chose to highlight its objections to some controversial government policies such as the sharp increase of ministers&#x27; salaries, the cost of healthcare, university education, transport and the GST. Most significantly, the SDP engineered an agreement with the other opposition parties to contest just under half the seats in Parliament, thus creating a &quot;by-election effect&quot; (reassuring voters that there would not be a change in government and encouraging them to elect more opposition voices).

The election results saw SDP best performance for an opposition in post-independence Singapore since Barisan Sosialis with a combined vote share of 48.6%. All nine of the candidates put up extremely strong fights against the PAP during this election, with three candidates elected to the parliament (Leader Chiam, party Chairman Ling How Doong and Cheo Chai Chen of Potong Pasir SMC, Bukit Gombak SMC and Nee Soon Central SMC, respectively); While Ling and Cheo were elected in tight margins, Chiam&#x27;s 69.6% was both himself and any opposition&#x27;s best performance hitherto. Along with Worker&#x27;s Party would-be leader Low Thia Khiang electing in Hougang, the opposition won a combined four parliament seats, then the largest representation since 1963. At the time, the result was viewed as being a notable setback to the ruling party and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.

In 1992, Chiam recruited Chee Soon Juan, a psychology lecturer at the National University of Singapore (NUS), to be an SDP candidate for a by-election in the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency. Although the SDP was unsuccessful in the by-election (the PAP won 72.9% of the votes, the SDP 24.5%, and other smaller parties 2.6%), the recruitment of Chee as a candidate generated considerable public interest. However differences between Chiam, Chee and the rest of the party&#x27;s Central Executive Committee were soon to emerge.
=== 1994–2000 ===
After being placed as the acting SDP leader in 1993, Chee began expressing his views on the lack of democracy in Singapore to the media. He published his second political book, &quot;Dare To Change: An Alternative Vision for Singapore&quot;, in 1996. This view had since led to the attention of the PAP&#x27;s Organizing Secretary Matthias Yao; ahead of the 1997 elections, Chee publicly issue a challenge to stand against Yao (who he accepted) in his constituency of MacPherson.

At the 1997 general election, the SDP suffered significant electoral setbacks with SDP failing to win a single seat since 1984, including incumbents Cheo and Ling, as well as Chee. Their party&#x27;s vote also dropped from 48.6% down to 33.1%, and no SDP members until now have been elected since. However, former SDP Member Chiam, now a SPP candidate, succeed in retaining his Potong Pasir seat, alongs WP&#x27;s Low in his Hougang ward; Chiam and Low were also the only opposition MPs returned to Parliament for two more elections (2001 and 2006).

In 1999, Chee came to national attention when he gave a public speech in the financial district despite being denied a permit to speak publicly.

=== 2001–2005 ===
During the campaigning, Chee&#x27;s meeting with then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong sparked public&#x27;s imagination during one of Goh&#x27;s rallies where he, along with his followers, raised their fists and chanted slogans. Later, from his campaign vehicle, Chee used a megaphone to ask Goh: &quot;Where is the S$18 billion that you have lent to (Indonesian President) Suharto?&quot; PAP shortly demanded Chee to apologise for claiming a false accusation or face a defamation lawsuit. Despite apologising to PAP a day later due to the party&#x27;s pressure, SDP further criticise the PAP&#x27;s economic policies and urged for the minimum wage of S$5 per hour for the rest of the 2001 campaign. The SDP&#x27;s economic alternatives were dismissed by the PAP which claimed that the SDP policies would lead Singapore to bankruptcy and inflation.

The party&#x27;s popular vote fell for the second consecutive election, down to 20.4%, in addition on failing to win a seat for the parliament. Due to bankruptcy set forth by the PAP in the following year (which barred candidates from running in elections), this was Chee&#x27;s last stint in the political arena until three elections later in 2015.

=== 2006 general election ===
In March 2006, just before the 2006 general election, the party appeared to be cracking from within after Chee was jailed for not paying a fine for contempt of court. Then-SDP&#x27;s chairman, Ling How Doong, was quoted as saying that the party &quot;would be run even better&quot; without Chee, citing that the party was not just a one-man show and could survive and even thrive without him. Chee&#x27;s sister Chee Siok Chin. also a party member, confirmed that the party remained united.

The party continued its preparations for the 2006 general election, choosing to target then-Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan in Sembawang GRC over the National Kidney Foundation Scandal and to ride on the public backlash at the time. The party subsequently published an editorial in the New Democrat questioning the PAP&#x27;s credibility over the issue, but PAP went to sue SDP for defamation on 22 April, and PAP won, resulting in the entire CEC (except for the Chee Siblings) to apologise and pay damages by 26 April.

Nevertheless, the party successfully nominate a combined seven candidates (Sembawang GRC and Bukit Panjang SMC) on nomination day, two days before being sued. The Sembawang team was led by Chee Siok Chin, along with businessmen Christopher Neo, Isa Abdul Aziz and Yong Chu Leong, marketing manager Gerald Sng Choon Guan and administrator Narayanasamy Gogelavany, while the party&#x27;s chair, Ling How Doong, was fielded in Bukit Panjang SMC. The SDP&#x27;s final vote share for Sembawang and Bukit Panjang was 23.3% and 22.8% respectively, marking a slight improvement in results as compared to 2001, but still far short of the national average of 33.3%.

=== &quot;Tak Boleh Tahan&quot; protest ===
On 15 March 2008, Chee and 18 others held a demonstration at Parliament House, all wearing red &quot;Tak Boleh Tahan&quot; (Cannot Take It) T-shirts to kick-start the campaign. At Parliament House, the protesters were warned by police to stop their unlawful assembly. When the warning was ignored, the police dispersed the protest and arrested the demonstrators.

The trial &quot;PP vs. Chee Soon Juan and 18 others&quot; began on October 23, 2008, with the defendants charged on two counts of violating Section 5(4)b Chapter 184 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public and Nuisance) Act. In their defense, the &quot;defendants claim that they&#x27;re innocent by virtue of their right under the Singapore constitution to enjoy the guarantees of freedom of assembly and expression&quot;, and the trial has been described by the Washington Times as &quot;a test about whether Singapore&#x27;s judiciary is independent&quot;.

=== 2011 general election ===

In preparation for the impending elections in 2011, the Singapore Democratic Party organized two pre-election rallies at Hong Lim Park on September and November 2010. The Party also unveiled a Shadow Budget in February 2011, as well as its campaign strategy, &quot;The SDP Promise&quot; in April 2011. Between September 2010 and April 2011, SDP also continued its groundwork in the constituencies of Bukit Panjang, Holland–Bukit Timah, Yuhua and Whampoa.

The party unveiled its slate of 11 candidates just a few days prior to Nomination Day. The candidates were introduced during press conferences on 21 and 22 April 2011. Former senior civil servant Tan Jee Say, private school teacher Michelle Lee Juen, psychiatrist Ang Yong Guan and social activist Vincent Wijeysingha made up the SDP&#x27;s team for Holland–Bukit Timah GRC. Also announced during this period of time was the party&#x27;s intention to contest Sembawang GRC. The team fielded there consisted of academic and former WP member James Gomez, party Assistant-Secretary-General John Tan, entrepreneur Jarrod Luo, former unionist Sadasivam Veriyah and businessman Mohd Isa. Former ISA detainee Teo Soh Lung and party treasurer Gerald Sng were also introduced to the media and were fielded in the constituencies of Yuhua and Bukit Panjang respectively. The party later recruited Alec Tok, leaving Sng to make way for Tok in Bukit Panjang SMC.

Among the issues brought up by the party prior to nomination day were: the heavy influx of foreigners into Singapore, Vivian Balakrishnan&#x27;s mismanagement of the Youth Olympic Games and the loss of sinking funds in the PAP run town councils in Holland–Bukit Timah and Bukit Panjang. However, these issues were quickly overshadowed by Balakrishnan&#x27;s attack on the SDP team over a video supposedly containing Wijeysingha&#x27;s &quot;gay agenda&quot;. The SDP quickly refuted these allegations on Wijeysingha, with the party&#x27;s Secretary-General making his stance clear on a video released by the party on 25 April. On nomination day, the Singapore Democratic Party team saw the nomination of all its candidates. In particular, the Holland–Bukit Timah team had also raised an objection to the nomination of the PAP&#x27;s candidates. The PAP&#x27;s Sim Ann had filed in her occupation as a former civil servant and this was disputed by the SDP team given the short time span between Sim Ann&#x27;s resignation from the civil service and nomination day.

On the polling day on 7 May, the SDP was defeated in all the seats they contested, with 36.1%, 33.73%, 33.14% for Sembawang GRC, Bukit Panjang SMC and Yuhua SMC, respectively; however, their team in Holland–Bukit Timah GRC scored its best result since 1997, with 39.92% (slightly above the national average of 39.86%), and the party&#x27;s scored 36.76% of the party&#x27;s popular vote.

After the election, Tan Jee Say resigned from SDP to seek candidacy for the presidential election held on the same year, as constitution states that candidates were required to be nonpartisan and cannot represent in any political party. Despite receiving endorsement from the oppositions, Tan only garnered 529,732 out of over two million valid votes (or 25.04%) and finished third in a rare four-cornered contest to Tony Tan (a former PAP member and Deputy Prime Minister), where he won the election with 744,397 votes (or 35.20%).

On 23 November 2012, secretary-general Chee was formally discharged from bankruptcy in court, allowing him to participate in future elections once more. Chee initially expressed his intention to contest the Punggol East SMC in the 2013 by-election (which was precipitated after the incumbent MP Michael Palmer resigned due to an extramarital affair), which could have marked his return to the political arena after a decade, but later pulled out from contest to avoid a multi-cornered contest and backed WP (whose candidate, Lee Li Lian, would later go on to win).

=== 2015 general election ===
Elections were called by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 2015 commemorating after 50 years of independence. The SDP contested five electoral divisions, which were Bukit Batok SMC, Bukit Panjang SMC, Yuhua SMC, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC and Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. For the SDP, the election saw the return to the politics for Secretary-General Chee since 2001 after Chee was discharged from bankruptcy, who led his team to contest Holland–Bukit Timah GRC (along with Paul Tambyah, a professor, Sidek Mallek, a compliance auditor, and Chong Wai Fung, a medical administrator). Despite failing to win any contested seat, Chee&#x27;s team of Holland–Bukit Timah GRC polled above the Opposition&#x27;s national average with 30.14% of the popular vote. All the candidates who contested this ward in the 2011 elections such as Vincent Wijeysingha, Tan Jee Say and Ang Yong Guan, resigned from the party prior; Tan and Ang would later become members to lead Singaporeans First. On 22 August, their party had moved their headquarters to Ang Mo Kio.

In this electoral contest, Chee was noted for shifting away from a confrontational style of politics in an attempt to soften his image. Whether this was successful is debatable though it is commonly argued that Chee&#x27;s return was a significant asset to the party. Although SDP&#x27;s combined vote of 31.2% was lower compared to the previous election, this was against the backdrop of a large swing away from opposition parties, of which SDP was one of the least affected.

=== 2016 Bukit Batok by-election ===
On 20 March 2016, SDP announced that Chee would stood as a candidate for the forthcoming by-election for the ward of Bukit Batok SMC held on 7 May, after incumbent David Ong vacated his seat due to an extramarital affair involving another grassroots leader. During nomination day on 27 April, Chee was successfully nominated and faced the PAP&#x27;s new candidate Murali Pillai (who previously contested the WP-held Aljunied GRC). Former SDP member Kwan Yue Keng also stated his intention to contest as independent, but later withdrew upon Chee&#x27;s successful nomination, as part of an agreement from the People&#x27;s Power Party to prevent a walkover.

Despite the by-election defeat, an 11.78% swing towards SDP from the last election saw Chee&#x27;s best performance score since 1997, at 38.79%. His best performance was widely attributed on his opinionated personality rather than introspective, and how his campaign drew notable attention to his supporters.

=== 2017–2018: Lawsuit regarding by-elections ===
On 7 August 2017, former Parliamentary Speaker Halimah Yacob vacated her seat in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC in order to contest that year&#x27;s presidential election. While the seat remain vacant, the grassroots advisor (which was linked to People&#x27;s Association) was replaced by Chua Chu Kang GRC MP Zaqy Mohamad the day after. Despite Mohamad was a minority MP for the GRC and a grassroots advisor is not the same as having an MP elected by residents of the constituency, one of the original purposes of the GRC system was to ensure minority representation, and thus a by-election was not held.

On 14 September (the same day Yacob was sworn as president after the election went uncontested), the party&#x27;s assistant treasurer Wong Souk Yee filed a lawsuit for a by-election (intended to occur on 15 January 2018 as cited in a pre-trial conference) to be called. Justice Chua Lee Ming presided on the hearing, but on 9 April 2018, their bid was dismissed and Wong was tasked to pay S$10,764.35; Chua told that a by-election should be called only when all seats in a GRC are vacated (which was did once on the 1992 Marine Parade by-election), and there is no legal basis to ask the three remaining MPs to resign.

On 16 January 2019, Wong called on the apex court to issue a mandatory order to compel its three MPs to step down for a two-hour hearing.

=== 2018–2020: Preparing for the 2020 general election ===
In July 2018, SDP was among the six other opposition parties (the others were Reform Party, Singaporeans First, People&#x27;s Power Party, Democratic Progressive Party, National Solidarity Party, and a new party formed by former NSP chief Lim Tean, People&#x27;s Voice Party) present in a meeting led by former PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock, on the possibility of forming a collation for the next election with Tan as the party leader. SDP intend to side WP as stated after the 2015 elections, but the latter declined their participation request, and did not turn up on the party&#x27;s meeting.

On 23 February 2019, at the time the impending election was yet to be announced, the party was the first to begin their election campaign despite a last-minute venue dropout, and announced that they would contest the same constituencies as they did in the 2015 election, and a goal to prevent the ruling PAP from retaining a government with a supermajority (two-thirds of the total number of parliamentary seats) that the party attained since post-independence. Party&#x27;s vice-chairman John Tan announced that SDP would also unveil policy papers on housing and the cost of living the following month, followed by healthcare and population issues in May. Former DPP secretary-leader Benjamin Pwee, on the same time, was revealed that he and a few others have submitted their applications to join the SDP, after Pwee left the party on 19 February.

On 21 June, the party&#x27;s leader confirmed Chee would settle a rematch in the Bukit Batok SMC against Murali in the election. Three days later on the 24th, the party confirmed their intentions to contest the same wards that they challenged in the last election, namely Bukit Panjang, Holland–Bukit Timah, Marsiling–Yew Tee and Yuhua. Their nominations were confirmed on 30 June, resulting in 11 candidates competing in the election, among which three candidates made their election debut, and Tan Jee Say returning to the party after earlier dissolving Singaporean First ahead of the nominations.

SDP chairman and Bukit Panjang candidate Paul Tambyah on 3 July had said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had told &quot;employers they were not allowed to bring their workers for testing&quot;, an allegation that Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong later denied on 5 July.

When the results was announced on 10 July, they were defeated in every seats contested, although Bukit Panjang came that close to winning the election with chairman Tambyah garnering 46.26% of the votes, while Chee came second with 45.20% of the votes while contesting Bukit Batok. Their vote share based on the constituencies contested was 37.04%, falling short from the national average of 38.76%.

=== 2020-2025: Party improvements ===
The party remained undeterred following the 2020 elections, especially on how the team ran a good campaign and the appearance of Tambyah. Former chairman Ling How Doong died on 30 April 2021 due to pneumonia.

In 2023, the party made early preparations leading up to the next General election, scheduled to be held before November 2025, including its intention to contest on Sembawang GRC for the first time since 2011, where the party began their walkabouts around August. On 12 April, the party announced that they will relocate their headquarters from Ang Mo Kio after eight years on 11 November to the &quot;western half of the island&quot;, later revealing to be WGECA Tower. The party also suggested a coalition with Progress Singapore Party on June that year. However, the party mourned its death of a recently CEC member-elect and Assistant Treasurer Manimaran Ashukumar on 29 July 2023.

On 11 May 2024, the SDP held its GE2024 Campaign Launch event at its headquarters in Bukit Batok. Led by Secretary-General Dr Chee Soon Juan and Chairman Dr Paul Tambyah, the party outlined key quality of life issues it would focus on as part of its election campaign – cost of living, inequality, productivity, and national identity – and put forth its position on current immigration and manpower policies affecting the former.
